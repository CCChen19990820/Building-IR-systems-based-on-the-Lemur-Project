The Honorable Sheila E. Widnall<BR>
Secretary of the Air Force<BR>
The Air Force in the New World Order<BR>
Orlando AFA Symposium<BR>
February 16, 1996<BR>
<P>
  Thank you.  It's great to be here in Orlando, enjoying the sun and the warmth, and it's a pleasure to talk to so many Air Force
members and supporters.
<P>  As you know, the focus of this conference is air warfare requirements of the future.  Within that context, I usually discuss the
modernization programs we're pursuing to preserve our core competencies and execute our mission.  Yet, I also think it's valuable
to take a step back and consider more generally our contributions to the national security strategy, and how those contributions
themselves shape the Air Force of the future.  So that will be my focus this morning:  first, the Air Force's role in the national security
strategy of engagement and enlargement, and second, how this strategy, and the lessons we are learning as we execute it, are shaping
the nation's Air Force.   
<P>
                           <CENTER>Engagement and Enlargement</CENTER>

 <P> As you have often heard, our national security strategy is founded on our commitment to remain engaged abroad.  We are the
world's greatest power, and we have global interests as well as responsibilities.  For the American people to be safer and enjoy
expanding opportunities, we must work to promote the spread of democracy, open foreign markets, and pursue new opportunities
for peace.
<P>  It's clear, based on a number of successes over the past few years, that global involvement and engagement is in the best interest
of the nation   and it's a requirement if we are to secure prosperity for future generations.  Ultimately that strategy is designed to
create a better world for our children.  And I would offer the premise that this same goal   of making the world better for our
children is the reason why we build military forces.  Now that's not a mission statement that you will find written anywhere, but
it's what we're all about.  
 <P> Whether we're deterring global war as the Air Force did for the long decades of the Cold War; or fighting conventional wars
in theaters far from home   as the Air Force has done three times in our relatively brief existence;  or delivering humanitarian aid
to trouble spots around the world   as we do routinely, every day   that is the ultimate justification for the resources that the
American people entrust to us.
 <P> With the end of the Cold War, the ways in which we now operate and the missions we execute in support of that larger goal have
changed dramatically.  I want to focus for a few minutes on two activities that are dramatically dissimilar in most ways, but share
some key characteristics.  First, both point to the quality of our forces; second, both provide very clear markers of the directions in
which our Air Force is evolving.
<P>
                                <CENTER>Deliberate Force</CENTER>

 <P> The first of these was by far the more dramatic: our air operation around Sarajevo last September, Operation Deliberate Force. 
Already the events of those days are dimming as time passes and the situation in Bosnia evolves.  But we can all think back on that
time   with the citizens of Sarajevo running through the streets to evade the sniper fire   with artillery firing into the city from
the surrounding hills   with the UN forces operating in Bosnia an object of contempt for the warring parties   with NATO air
forces having compiled a two-year record of frustration that threatened to tear the Alliance apart   and with the warring parties
showing no inclination to participate in serious peace negotiations.
<P>  On August 28 the citizens of Sarajevo paid the price in blood once again for the war, with another shelling atrocity.  And finally,
for the first time in the sad history of that conflict, the UN and NATO were able to forge and execute an agreement for a robust,
sustained response to that outrage.  The following day, NATO forces opened an air campaign that fundamentally altered the course
of that three-year war.
 <P> What were the central characteristics of that air response?
<P>  First, it was a coalition response.  While the Air Force spearheaded the effort   and Air Force General Mike Ryan commanded
the NATO headquarters creating unity of effort   our colleagues from the Navy and Marine Corps were there, hitting the same
targets, accepting the same risks.  More than that, our sister forces from across the NATO alliance were there, demonstrating the
professionalism that was so central to the operation's success.
 <P> Second, it was a precision response.  We tend to focus on the tactical and technical level when we discuss precision in our
operations   concentrating on the remarkable capabilities provided by our modern weaponry.  And certainly that weaponry proved
itself again in this operation.  In fact, Deliberate Force extended a trend which began with the Vietnam War   in which about .2
percent of our weapons expended were precision   and continued in Desert Storm, where contrary to the general perception of its
having been a "video war," only about 9 percent of our bombs were precision guided.  In Deliberate Force, over 60 percent of the
bombs dropped by the NATO force were precision-guided. 
 <P> But all this technology means little without aircrews rigorously trained and operating with absolute discipline.  And across the
Alliance, the nations provided exactly that kind of force.  Perhaps the most difficult task that can ever face a young pilot is to plan
and brief a mission   fly those long, lonely minutes to the target area   accept the risks of penetrating the defenses   and then
deliberately withhold his weapons release because he could not absolutely, positively identify his target.  Yet we demanded exactly
that and those young pilots delivered.  It was a remarkable testimonial to their training and leadership.
 <P> But we need to step back from this narrow focus, to look at the larger issue   of the precision with which this operation met
the political ends toward which it was directed.  And this was among the key lessons of this operation   though hardly a new one. 
This force was effective, ultimately, because it was applied toward clear, achieveable policy objectives, in effective coordination
with other diplomatic tools, with a clear view of military requirements.   The United States, of course, was central in defining those
objectives within the Alliance framework   and carefully applied the lessons we learned in places like Vietnam and Somalia as the
operation was contemplated.
 <P> What did this operation achieve?  Simply stated   Sarajevo's citizens are free to walk in the sun.  The parties agreed to serious
negotiations.  And the air campaign triggered a sequence of events that lanced the boil of this war before it further affected the NATO
alliance or spilled out of its borders.
  <P>What did we learn from our perspective as we look toward shaping the Air Force for the next millenium?
  <P>First, we learned that precision weaponry is essential to modern air operations.  The military utility of these weapons, of course,
has been recognized for decades.  But beyond the ability to strike more targets, with less exposure of friendly forces, their role in
limiting collateral damage has become central in this media-intensive environment we operate in.  The NATO air operation was
operationally robust   but it was politically fragile.  With the first report of civilian casualties, the entire operation would have been
put at risk   but that report never came.  Today we are bringing on line a whole family of next-generation precision weapons that
will extend their capabilities beyond anything now known.
 <P> Second, we learned again that information dominance works.  You can never have enough of an edge over your opponent in your
awareness of his capabilities   or how to counter them.
 <P> We are focusing huge resources, energy, and attention to this problem   creating new structures for theater battle management
and command and control   looking toward new capabilities among our space-based communications and intelligence sources. 
In the months immediately preceding the air campaign, we worked hard to upgrade the NATO headquarters controlling this operation
with a system we call the JFACC Situational Awareness System, or JSAS.  This system was designed to meld information from
space-, air-, and ground-based sources instantaneously, and present a real-time picture of what is going on in theater. That system
gave our air commander the situation awareness he needed to orchestrate this enormously complex, multinational operation.  It was
hugely successful   and provided a precursor of  what lies ahead.
 <P> The Air Force has long concentrated on this area, and has developed some amazing capabilities   but as we look toward the
technical possibilities now opening before us, the image that comes to mind is of standing before an open doorway, looking through
it toward endless possibilities beyond.  We are getting ready to step through that doorway.
 <P> In fact, we are employing some of these capabilities right now, in our peace enforcement effort in Bosnia, and last week I heard
a story I want to share with you.  We have employed the E-8 JSTARS, a modified Boeing 707 with its moving target indicator and
synthetic aperture radar, to take incredibly detailed real-time pictures of Serbian movements and encampments.  The NATO
commander enforcing the separation there has taken to slapping those pictures down in front of the Serbs during their meetings to
say,  "See, you can't do anything we don't know about!"  This is powerful   it's like playing poker, and being able to see all the
cards against an opponent that knows that you can do just that.  Talk about dominance!!
  <P>Third, coalition operations work.  The decades of cooperation with NATO   fielding interoperable equipment, defining common
doctrine, exercising and training together   paid off handsomely.  Our allied air forces operated as a force multiplier.  Equally
important, they operated as a glue for the political consensus needed to see that operation through to completion.  We have paid close
attention to our ability to work with coalition partners around the world   not just in NATO, where the Alliance's political-military
framework provides such a strong structure for such work, but around the globe, through a series of bilateral training efforts.
  <P>And finally, in Deliberate Force we reaffirmed the utility of air forces in providing options for our national policy-makers.  Over
the years of our growing involvement in the war in the former Yugoslavia, this nation had used political tools   economic tools  
diplomatic tools   all to no avail.  This nation's air forces provided a military option at relatively low risk, with a real prospect of
success.  And that option paid off.
 <P> So in this case we saw a carefully controlled use of lethal force.  We had tried to avoid that   for all the right reasons.  But that
operation served to jar the course of events from the tracks they were on, to a more promising course.
  <P>Over the past few months we have seen the movement along this new track.  The Alliance has moved in with its interposition
force.  Peace, however fragile, has descended over that land.  And with the arrival of the NATO force, we have noted one more lesson
the value of the unique national treasure of our strategic airlift force. 
 <P> Our workhorse for the last 30 years, the C-141, and our newest carrier, the C-17, worked around the clock to deliver thousands
of American service men and women, as well as their supplies and equipment to Bosnia.  Airmen unloaded tons of gear in a frozen
countryside.  The C-17 delivered extra large bridge sections, which allowed us to ford the swollen waters of the Sava River and cross
into Bosnia, bringing our message of hope to a ravaged land     and more significantly, opening a crucial line of supply for our
troops engaged in the peace implementation force.  In fact, the C-17 is quickly becoming indispensable, as our operations in Bosnia
show just how well its unique capabilities fit our needs.  Operating from small airfields, sometimes hostile environments, and
delivering oversize equipment, twelve C-17s delivered almost 50 percent of the cargo during the peak deployment period.  
<P>  I was discussing our effort there with a member of my staff, as the intensive initial portion of our airlift operation drew to a close. 
We were both shocked at the ease with which we had just executed a mission that no other nation on earth could even attempt  
in lifting these forces into theater rapidly, despite the terrible weather that prevails in Bosnia this time of year.  It is very like Sherlock
Holmes's dog that didn't bark in the night:  the most remarkable aspect of this story, is that nobody notices how remarkable it is. 
Needless to say, this has been a source of great pride to us in the Air Force.  And again, it points to the powerful tool that your
military puts into the hand of our national decision-makers.
<P>
                              <CENTER>Mil-to-Mil Contacts</CENTER>
<P>
 <P> Now I'd like to turn to a second area in which your Air Force is making this world safer for your children   the range of contacts
we have established with emerging democracies.  
 <P> One could hardly think of a sort of work more unlike Deliberate Force.  Our contact program will never receive even a small
proportion of the attention that Deliberate Force did.  It will last for years, not weeks.  But perhaps when we look back from the
vantage of years hence   we will find that this range of contacts has had a more profound impact than did that air campaign.
 <P> This is a story that I find amazing every time I tell it   and still more amazing every time I see it in action.  There remains
something uniquely thrilling about seeing troops from Ukraine exercising in Louisiana   or German forces exercising with the
Polish Army outside Cracow   or a Russian colonel attending the Air War College in Alabama.  (Unfortunately, the first one
defected   perhaps we taught him too much about life in America.)
 <P> We have established an enormous range of contacts with these nations.  From the President's Partnership for Peace initiative
in Europe, to the military contact program we conduct with the nations of central Europe, to the National Guard's "Building Bridges
to America" program, which pairs a State Guard with each emerging nation   the intensity and the ingenuity of this contact program
continue to grow.  And these programs have long since expanded beyond their origins, when they concentrated on tactical events. 
They have long since stepped up to the more difficult and fundamental questions facing these nations as they restructure their military
and its relationships to society.
 <P> But I've spoken to you before about the transformation in Central Europe.  You need to take what we're doing there and project
it worldwide.  Every day the Air Force is engaged in literally hundreds of similar activities with countries around the globe.  Beyond
improving training and international cooperation with foreign forces, these operations accomplish many other objectives.  They serve
to show the flag abroad, demonstrating American interest and commitment to many regions of the globe.  They are a learning
exercise for both U.S. forces and our international counterparts.  And they build relationships, trust, confidence and a working
knowledge of each other's military and culture.  
 <P> For instance, in South America we have Special Ops forces in Peru, Bolivia, Columbia, and Venezuela, working with local
governments to curb drug trafficking.  We have three major humanitarian and civic assistance exercises going on today involving
13 units from all over the United States.  As I speak, we have a Prime Beef Team building schools in Belize, a Red Horse Squadron
drilling wells in Honduras, and an Air Evacuation Squadron at Howard AFB supporting Southern Spirit, a medical exercise.  
  <P>Our Judge Advocate General has conducted 26 visits and exchanges with eleven countries in the region, exposing those emerging
democracies to the myriad of legal issues and precedents associated with civilian control of the military.  Through all these efforts,
we learn the challenges these nations face, and better understand the pressures they endure.  It's a win-win situation.
 <P> We also work closely with the air forces in the region, attending and hosting a number of service chiefs conferences.  We recently
hosted a conference on Personnel and Professional Development in the military, and this summer we will focus on the exchange of
weather information.  Finally, several countries   Argentina, Venezuela, Chile, and Brazil   want to join us in our Red Flag
exercise.
 <P> This strategy of engagement is equally effective on the other side of the globe as we exercise, train, and exchange information
with our Asian-Pacific friends.  In Japan, our 47,000 troops provide a stabilizing force for all the nations of Asia.  In South Korea,
the U.S. security commitment remains unshakable, demonstrated by the 37,000 American troops stationed there.  Further south, we
participated in an Australian-hosted, multilateral exercise with five other nations, including Singapore, Malaysia, and Indonesia. 
In December, we held an air doctrine symposium in Guam, which was attended by 14 Asia-Pacific nations.  And just last Friday (9
Feb 96) we finished a two-week COPE TIGER exercise with our Thai and Singapore counterparts.
  <P>Once again, the common thread running through all these activities is the professionalism and commitment of the men and
women of the United States Air Force.  I never cease to be amazed at the ability of our 20-year-olds to represent the U.S. effectively
in Bosnia, work closely with their Russian counterparts on a peacekeeping operation, or help build schools in El Salvador.
 <P> These tremendously effective initiatives are only some of the new obligations that the Air Force has picked up with the change
in the strategic environment of the past five years.  They are part of a larger phenomenon that we have faced, of an operational tempo
far exceeding any that we ever saw during the Cold War.  We are supporting these obligations with forces about 60 percent of their
size during that period.  Right now, of the roughly 400,000 Air Force men and women on active duty, 80,000 are stationed overseas
 <P> and about 14,000 more are deployed in support of these new missions.  Our people are proud to be called upon to perform these
duties   but we have taken a series of steps to ensure that they, and their families, can sustain this tempo.  
<P>
                                   <CENTER>Conclusion</CENTER>
<P>
  So now I'd like to close, asking you as I do so to keep in mind the ultimate end of military forces that I mentioned as we opened
this discussion.  Ultimately we exist to create a better world for our children. 
<P>  Toward that end, the American people entrust enormous resources to our care.  We feel a keen sense of stewardship as we
employ those resources to build an Air Force capable of meeting its responsibilities   now and in the decades to come.
<P>  And I would ask you to look beyond the return on that investment as being just so many satellites or fighters or bombers or
communications squadrons.  As we move throughout the world to support America's interests, we do so with more than just aircraft
and weapons.  We do so with an Air Force that is better trained and better educated than any in our history.  And above all, we do
so with the conviction that by enduring sacrifices and, if necessary, risking lives today, we can build a better, safer world for
tomorrow.  That safer world is the real return on your investment   and I am proud of the role that we have played in helping create
that world over the past few years.  Thank you.
<P>
  <I>GENERAL SHAUD:</I> The array of questions falls in two areas:  the scientific-industrial area and the other about quality of life. 
Does the Air Force-industry partnership in space launch provide a good model for obtaining cooperative Air
Force-industrial efforts in information dominance?
<P>  <I>DR. WIDNALL:</I>  The simple answer to that is yes.  I view all of these as evolutionary, and I believe George Muellner will
talk about this when he discusses acquisition reform.  
z,p.  We really have developed a new way of working with industry to bring them in very early in the developmental stage. 
With Darleen s [Darleen Druyun,  SAF/AQ] Lightning Bolt initiatives to get out of their way when they are trying to run
a program, it saves us money and provides a better product.  We really are working with industry in a new way across all
of the program areas.  I am keeping special interest in the EELV [Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle] and in the JAST
[Joint Advanced Strike Technology] program and in the Direct Broadcast Satellite program that the Air Force is now
running.  
<P>  We have a lot of really exciting things and again, it is almost the theme that I spoke about earlier.  It isn t just the
hardware; and it isn t just the technology.  It is the people and the way we work together in new ways.  It parallels my
remarks about what the Air Force itself it doing.  
<P>  <I>GENERAL SHAUD:</I>  Evidently, information warfare is a popular subject.  As we approach information in the international
community are there contacts that are proving useful as other nations work on this same subject?
<P>  <I>DR. WIDNALL:</I>  I am not sure I can answer that question.  Information warfare is a sensitive subject, and I think I d just
as soon deflect that one, if I might.
<P>  <I>GENERAL SHAUD:</I>You stress the importance of precision and well-trained air crews, while Dr. McCall [Dr. Gene H.
McCall, Chairman, USAF Scientific Advisory Board] and the New World Vistas has focused heavily on unmanned aerial
vehicles.  How important will the "man" be in the loop for future systems?
<P> <I>DR. WIDNALL:</I>  Again, I am not sure I can answer that question specifically.  I d rather talk about it from a process point
of view.  We tasked the Air Force Scientific Advisory Board to give us a vision of what might be possible in the next 50
years with technologies that are rapidly emerging.  We have received their report.  We have gotten extremely good response
from the scientific community and from the media, but we are at a very early stage in pursuing a number of those ideas. 
<P>
  The next step for the Air Force is to look at those ideas and map them on to our R&D programs   our basic and applied
research programs that will take us into the next decade.  As we move forward, we will learn a lot.  We are already
committed to UAVs [Unmanned Aerial Vehicle].  We have a UAV squadron and we are getting good information from
the Predator in Bosnia.  It is just on its way over there for the spring cycle.  It is a "learning by doing" process that we are
going through.  
<P>  We are necessarily committed to the future.  That is what the Air Force is all about.
<P>  <I>GENERAL SHAUD:</I>  We look forward to Dr. McCall briefing our science and technology committee this afternoon.  The new
world order seems to require a lot of TDY.  Are there any innovative thoughts or plans to help manage this load and keep
the quality of life for Air Force families as high as possible?
<P><I>DR. WIDNALL:</I>  We have done a lot.  The Chief mentioned yesterday that we have set a standard of 120 days/per year
which tells us where we ve a problem.  The individual bases are doing wonderful things, and they are organizing a variety
of programs into a single, one-stop shopping family support center.  People in a deployment situation can really get
everything they need.  The bases have been absolutely fanastic in responding to this.  
 <P> It isn t just the air crews and the weapons systems and certain specialties.  It is also the security police, medical
personnel and the Red Horse teams for goodness sake.  Air Force people in all specialties are in great demand.  This is a
comprehensive problem that applies to all of our people.  But it is worked at the base level with extremely good support
from Air Force leadership.
 <P> <I>GENERAL SHAUD:</I>  Dr. Perry [Honorable William J. Perry, Secretary of Defense] has talked a lot about the emphasis on
military family housing.  The Quality of Life Commission had recommended the involvement of the private sector in the
process.  Would you give us an update on how that is going?
  <P><I>DR. WIDNALL:</I> The best way to think about that is a phase 1, phase 2, and phase 3 approach.  We are into Phase 1.  My
understanding is there is legislative relief in the Authorization Bill which will allow us to expand the range of experiments
we can run with the private sector.  Our civil engineers, headed by Gene Lupia [Maj. Gen. Eugene A. Lupia] who is
probably here some place, are hot on the trail by looking at experiments with the private sector at specific bases.  
 <P> What we want to do in Phase 1 is to learn a lot about what these new legislative initiatives will give us.  There may be
some Phase 2 and Phase 3 activities that are coming out of the Marsh Commission.  There is a an IPT at the OSD level that
is looking at the possibilities, and we are staying very plugged into them.  We believe the Air Force, by working out the
details in specific opportunities, can actually teach the overall system a lot about what is possible.  
  <P>The bottom-line for us is that we truly believe we want the projects managed by the face-to-the-customer level  at the
bases.  We don t ever want the management to get too far from the customers.  We will work privatization issues with our
customers, our airmen and our families in mind.  
  <P><I>GENERAL SHAUD:</I>  Dr. Widnall we have a final question.  We know you travel around a lot and hear from the troops and
this is about the commissaries being under seemingly endless attacks.  In your view, how important is this benefit and are
there opportunities for further reform of the commissary system?
 <P><I>DR. WIDNALL:</I>  I actually notice that the attacks on the commissaries have decreased since Dr. Perry made it quite clear
that he supports the commissaries.  So we haven t seen a lot of that.  On the other hand, all of us in DoD are looking for
ways to be more cost effective and efficient in what we do.  The Commissary Agency should not escape that scrutiny.  We
would expect them to continue to streamline and apply good management principles.  But Dr. Perry is completely
supportive of the commissaries, so we don t see a lot of budgetary attacks on the commissary system.
<P>  <I>GENERAL SHAUD:</I>  Dr.  Widnall, we thank you for your nurture and care of your U.S. Air Force.

Force XXI<BR>
Orlando AFA Symposium<BR>
February 15, 1996<BR>
<P>
  Thank you very much for letting me be here this afternoon.  Joe Ralston called me a couple months ago and said,
"Would you come out and give us about a 20-minute speech."  I said, "You don t know what you ve asked."  He said, "I
really want you to come talk about the future of the U.S. Army."
<P>  What I will attempt this afternoon is to tell you a little bit about the Army that is in transition.  I could not agree more
with your Chief of Staff and my good friend, General Ron Fogleman, that your strategy, which you articulated very rapidly
after 1989, signaled a change in where our world was and where it was going.  We took longer to do that and have been
in the process for about two years.  We probably have another year or two to go on the process, but I d like to describe it
to you today.
<P>  My former Chief of Staff, General Gordon Sullivan, and my predecessor General Freddie Franks, along with help from
Mike Loh [Gen. John M. Loh] and others, coined the phrase Force XXI.  Force XXI is actually  a process.  It will lead us
to the Army of the 21st century, whatever that becomes.
<P>  We are two years into this process and have spent a lot of resources to figure it out, have bent a lot of metal, made a lot
of mistakes and have learned a few things.  We believe we are heading away from a "threat-based" Army you can quantify
very precisely and very exactly, to a capabilities-based Army, an Army which can reach into its tool kit and take out
whatever it needs to put into the joint equation to respond to whatever crisis exists at the time.  That is probably a little
simplistic.  Certainly there is still a precise consideration of the threat, but it is more generic than it once was.  
<P>  To get to the 21st century Army, given the realization of the need, we began to think about how we change.  There are
generally two ways the Army historically has changed.  One was an event-based, cautious change such as when the horse
replaced the foot soldier or when the saber came into use.  During my 33 years in the Army, I have been involved with
many changes of this type.  When the helicopter arrived on the battlefield in the late 1960s, we created a division built
around the notion of vertical envelopment using rotary-wing aircraft   the 11th Air Assault Division.
<P>  That is cautious change.  It s characterized by standing on today s concepts, euphemistically, looking around,
understanding the threat and then cautiously anticipating what will have to be done with each capability, each system, and
each process as you move forward to counter the threat.  For example, if a plane flies at Mach X today, and it belongs to
the enemy, then we need to go faster and turn inside its radius.  This is typical of that sort of process.  
<P>  In 1963, when I walked into a command center   the first I had ever seen in the Army   it was characterized by maps
hanging all over the wall, acetate over the maps and people running around putting little sticky things on the maps while
radios burbled in the background.  It was controlled confusion with a lot of noise, and somehow, in the middle of that, there
was one senior officer or senior NCO who was the ring master of this circus.  Somehow it produced command and control.
<P>  In 1989, I had the privilege of being the J-3 for the force and running the command center when our Army and Air Force
conducted Operation Just Cause in Panama.  Our command center had maps on the walls and acetate over it and people
frantically running around with little sticky things.  We had progressed to grease pencils, but the radios burbled in the
background and General Max Thurman was in the center as the ring master.  From 1963 to 1989, not much had changed
in the way we did business.  
<P>  About a year and a half ago, I had the privilege of being the Deputy Commander in Chief of Atlantic Command during
the Haiti operation.  If you had walked into that command center, you would have been stunned by the silence.  One wall
quietly glowed with the four network news programs, and you could listen to the one you wished if you put on your
headset.  Each of the operators had a keyboard in front of them and if you wanted the situation report on anything, you
pulled it up on your screen when needed.  If you wanted to talk to the air component commander, the land component
commander or the naval component commander, you did it on a video interlink.  If you both wanted to look at the same
map and do the John Madden light pen negotiation trick on the map, you could do that.  
<P>  In the five years between 1989 and 1994, technology had come upon the Army in a way that we had not anticipated,
and it was certainly a bow wave.  Our move into the 21st century is trying to accommodate those changes.  We started this
move by saying we can t do this cautious, casual forward movement any longer, we have to try to take a major step.  We
gathered a lot of commanders and smart folks from all services, and we took a mental staff ride into the 21st century.  We
got on a mountain top, and we tried to write down and codify what we thought we saw.  We put it in a book, TRADOC
PAM 525-5.  It had the vision of what we thought we saw in the 21st century.  
<P>  Everyone of us was smart enough to understand we might have been on the wrong mountain, it might have been a
cloudy day or our vision was not terribly correct.  We knew it would take a lot of experimentation, a lot of testing, and a
lot of probing at the hypothesis.  Now, we are beginning see some things stand up.  
<P>  First, we tried to determine what the Army would need to do in the 21st century.  It will need to do four things, all as
a part of a joint team.  We don t think we are going to fight alone; we haven t for many, many years and will not in the
future.  
<P>  We need to deter or take our part in a deterrence role; to compel (read fight and destroy); to support when necessary;
and to reassure when required by presence, help, aid and support.  Those are the basic four roles we think the Army will
have into the 21st century.  
<P>  Given this bow wave of technology, what does that tell us about characteristics the Army will have to have?
<P>  We are going to have to be more doctrinally flexible than we ever have before and be able to work across a different
layer or spectrum of conflict.  We began to see glimpses of that change in Haiti and in Florida.  We had 22,000 soldiers
in Haiti, and more than that in Florida cleaning up after a hurricane.  We need to be operationally agile so we can go 200
miles in a night and a half across a desert, form a six division force, and attack from the left flank.  We began to see that
in the Desert Campaign.  We need to loosen our heads so that we can understand how better to work with other services
and how to be more tailorable and more modular.  
<P>  I had the privilege of being present when we put an infantry division and all of its aviation assets on a carrier deck.  It
was an opportunity to use the Navy s capability to have a floating air force base where it was needed and when it was
required.  We have to work across the full dimension of operations, and we will do it jointly, multinationally and with an
interagency partnership, where necessary.
<P>  What about the future will let us do that better than we do today?  
<P>  We think it has to do with information.  It has to do with the ability to move information, to do it more rapidly  
quantum leaps more rapidly, and to put a picture of the battlefield in the hands of the private and general at the same time. 
We want to say with some assurance, "We know where the enemy is; we know where we are; and we are coming to get
you."  
<P>  I don t mean to be dramatic, but it is the biggest problem we ve ever had.  I can t tell you how many times in the middle
of the night someone handed me a rolled up order that they had very slowly written out in pencil or with grease penciled
overlays, wrapped it nicely in a canister and sent me off in the middle of the night to take it to Colonel Garcia.  I would
get my jeep stuck in the ditch about two hours later and I would get it to Colonel Garcia about two hours after the line of
departure should have been crossed.  We cannot do that in this modern age.  We realized that about two years ago, and
started a three part campaign.
<P>  We needed to redesign the tactical Army and put a tactical Army on the ground about the turn of the century that would
last twice as long as most have lasted.  We wanted a tactical Army that would be relevant through 2015. 
<P>  We understand many of our systems will be legacy systems.  There will be some new ones, but we had to leverage
information and information technologies to get the best bang out of what we have.  It will also require redesign of the
institutional Army.  
<P>  I am a schoolmaster, and I run the schools for the Army.  We think that s very important and I know you do, too.  I am
not so certain I can afford to run the kinds of schools that I have right now.  I have 27 different schools at installations in
14 states and 14 liaison officers from 13 countries that support the United States Army.  We bring soldiers, sailors, airmen
and marines to those schools for instruction.  We just finished teaching four complete courses to a battalion in the Sinai
Desert totally by television through satelites and with the same quality we would in the classroom for much less than
it would cost to bring all of those people to an installation for a period of time.
<P> We also are beset by this bow wave of technology.  As you know, all great ideas aren t.  Some are wonderful.  Some
turn out to be somewhat less than wonderful.  So, we put together an office in Washington whose sole purpose is to
interface with the high tech part of industry, and after a great deal of scrutiny, pick those things we can afford.  Or, better
still, pick things we can t afford not to have.  I am in charge of the centerpiece for that.  I serve in the command which is
responsible for redesigning the tactical Army.  That is what I d like to talk about for the rest of my time today.
<P>  We've done three things.  For about a year and a half, we put together our best minds   the commandants of our
schools, our division commanders, people who are serving in the field and on the ground    through a series of work
sessions, seminars, think pieces, and rock drills on the floors of large gymnasiums fighting with each other about how to
fight. We've come up with some notions that I ll share with you.  
<P>  Then we took all of what we thought about designs in the Army and all of what we knew about what might be available
in the way of systems, and we ran it through our simulations.  I have the same fears and the same concerns that your Chief
has about simulations.  It is very easy to model tank against tank, but it is very difficult to model that the province chief s
nephew runs the ice plant.
<P>  In any case, we took the best simulations we could generate, and we conducted multiple runs for six months to set a base
line for further experimentation.  Then, over the last year and a half, we ve run four advanced warfighting exercises.  One
of them was Roving Sands, and many of you were there.  Within Roving Sands, we put a very stringent hypothesis on the
table about the Army s part of theater missile defense.  We came away with things you could not learn any way except in
a live, experimental environment.  
<P>  The second exercise was Prairie Warrior, a look at our division command capabilities.  The Army has had the same staff
organization since 1911.  We have been functionally organized.  We have had a G-1, having to do with personnel; a G-2
having to do with intelligence; a G-3 with operations; and a G-4 with logistics.  It s been the same since 1911.  Think about
it. If you can get to relatively common situational awareness where everyone on the battlefield can see a great deal about
the enemy and know a great deal about where your own assets are, do you really need that kind of a staff?  Or, can you,
in fact, have a multi-functional staff where some people can worry about tomorrow and others about next week.
<P> We took all of what we thought about designs in the Army and all of what we knew about what might be available in the
way of systems, and we ran it through our simulations.
<P>  We built the command post at Fort Leavenworth in warehouses; put the technology there; trained people for six months
and then went and evaluated it.  That was a great idea that wasn t.  We are not quite ready for a paperless command center. 
It has to do with legacy systems and how fast we can move and how compatible we are with the other services.
<P>  The third of the four advanced warfighting experiments was a futuristic heavy tank battalion we put together with fewer
tanks and far more technology.  We did this at the western Kentucky training area near Fort Knox.  We trained this
battalion for six months, and then we fought against an enemy battalion "live" on the ground using all of the assets of our
National Training Center to watch this.  We began to learn some things that you probably have known for ages in the Air
Force, but were a little foreign to us.  I ll share one with you because it is both at the same time tremendously encouraging,
very exciting and very scary to us.  
<P>  For the last 10 years, we put every battalion-sized unit, 500-800 soldiers commanded by a lieutenant colonel   roughly
equivalent to a squadron, through a stiff, tough Red Flag/Blue Flag training experience at the National Training Center at
Fort Irwin, California.  We ve taped every single transmission that occurred and we conduct rough after action reviews. 
It has changed the way we think about training in the Army.  We have a generation of people who are not afraid of
accountability and are not afraid of talking about mistakes.  I know, I was one of the first of those.  It was painful.  
<P>  We went back and looked at decision making over 10 years of that experience.  We drug out all of the tapes and listened
to them again.  We found that 60 percent of the decisions our commanders made were sourced by information they either
saw through their binoculars or heard from an FM radio net.  The remainder of the input came from written orders, from
indecipherable intestinal fortitude and whatever else.  
<P>  With this experimental tank battalion, we took an average tank battalion commander, and we gave him a new command
vehicle.  It looked like sort of an excited porcupine, big steel box on tank treads, lot of antennas sticking out all over it. 
We downlinked all sorts of things right into computer screens in the command vehicle.  The commander trained for six
months and fought his battalion very well.  We looked at everything he did, and then after the fact, we scanned all of his
tapes, listened to everything he had to say and found that 60 percent of his decision making information came from icons
on a flat computer screen.  
<P>  That probably doesn t bother a fighter pilot at all because you ve been mentally working at Mach 3 for years.  But when
I look at an icon on a computer screen, my mind immediately looks at five or six levels of symbology.  Does that square
mean a battalion?  I wonder how many tanks it has. I wonder if they have gas.  How many people are there?  Where is it
located?  Can it get to where I want it to go tomorrow?  
<P>  You don t think that way and that commander didn t think that way.  He said, "That is an icon, and I trust it to be a
faithful replica of whatever it is supposed to replicate."  
<P>  I have a 15 and a half year old so.  He is an ice hockey player, but he broken his back last November so I had four
months of quality time with him that I would never have had otherwise.  He is fine now and he is back playing ice hockey
again.  During that period, he would drag me into his room at night, and we would play his computer games.  I can t tell
you how many times I crashed into the side of an aircraft carrier trying to land a Tomcat.  My mind does not assimilate
symbology in the same way that his generation does.  He thinks about trend lines.  The size of Mario has no meaning for
him unless he falls off, in which case the game is over.  He thinks in terms of trend lines and weapon stores.  He plots a
path along the way, and he looks way forward, anticipates and keeps a count of how many red light balls Mario has in his
little sack.  We are moving to a future where we think differently, and we are learning from the Air Force every day.
<P>  This trend is something we all see.  I talked to the Commandant of the Marines Corps and admire him a great deal, but
he took a different approach.  He took his senior officers, gave them a handful of monopoly money and sent them to the
floor of the stock exchange to learn how to bid rapidly enough not to lose their money.  An interesting concept in learning
to think more rapidly.  He also has them playing three checker games at a time in a computer to deal with more information. 
We haven't gone quite in that direction.  So what is the "so what" of all this. 
<P>  We think we will visualize the battlefield differently than we have done before.  Your Chief of Staff and I have talked
about this, and we see this about the same way.  We also think we ll use information more rapidly and in slightly different
ways than we ever have before.  As a result, we ll fight in slightly different ways than we have before.  
<P>  During most of my career, the AirLand Battle notion was linear.  We thought the enemy was coming from one direction
with air corridors and ground boundaries drawn with straight lines.  There was a deep, close and rear battle.  I can t tell
you how many hours we ve argued about the FSCL and where it was, what it meant, who owned it and who did what on
each side of it.  By the way, that is an "Inside the Beltway" argument.  It never seems to be a great deal of trouble when
the guns start to fire.  We work it out pretty well.  
<P>  From all of this experimentation, we have learned the battlefield of the future is more likely to be circular or amorphous
with an enemy that can come from any direction, maybe from one place one day and another the next day.  In fact, they
may be the enemy one day and not the next day.  If you think about your last six years of battle experience, it has been that
way.  It is a good predictor of the future where we must think multi-dimensionally.  
<P>  We must think about the human dimension, about cyberspace, about battlespace in the classic sense, height to the
stratosphere and above and unlimited boundaries.  The only two sure things in the future battle space are centers of gravity
  your Chief said you must figure out at the outset what the strategic and tactical centers of gravity are   and you must
also at the same time determine what the shaping events are that will allow you to reach that center of gravity with whatever
the tool is.  It can be air alone,  air and ground, or maybe ground alone, though I don t see that, and hope I never do.  
<P>  We've had glimpses of this already.  We were involved in a lightning strike or a little war, but quic lethal war, in
Panama.  The "center of gravity" was a place called the Comandancia.  It was the command and control center with its
commanding general.  There were many supporting events that took place simultaneously to allow overcoming that center
of gravity.  Some were pure air targets.  One of my most prized possessions is a little silver coin from the AC-130
"Ghostriders."  I will never forget the precision with which you can put a 105mm round out of an aircraft.  
<P>  We need to seek ways to make sure we build equipment and teach tactics that will allow us to shape the battlefield with
as much simultaneity as we possibly can.  
<P>  It worked for the Desert Campaign.  We had a marvelous and wonderful air campaign.  Air got there first, and did
everything the Chief said.  We got into the five-day air-ground campaign at the point of decision and we shaped the
battlefield with special operations forces on the northern and north eastern flanks.  We had an amphibious deception off
the southeastern shore, the feint up Wadi al-Batin and the special operations forces and the Scud hunt in the western desert. 
It involved simultaneity and shaping the battlefield.  Then we had the air-ground strike from the left flank into the center
of gravity, the Republican Guards.  
<P>  About seven months ago, General George Joulwan [EUCOM] and I spent a weekend together in a house on Fort Story
[Va.].   He showed me a map of Bosnia and said he looks at this problem in terms of centers of gravityand shaping events. 
If you think about the sectors and where the important spots are today, it wasn t a bad guess that he had.  How do we use
information technologies to do all these things?
<P>  We have to do a number of things.  We have to link strategic, operational and tactical sensors together vertically so we
can all see the same picture at roughly the same time.  That scares some of us who served in Vietnam as ground
commanders who had a battalion commander at a thousand feet in a helicopter and a brigade commander at 1,500 feet in
a helicopter and a division commander at 2,000 feet in a helicopter.  Eventually the kind of guidance you would get in that
sort of vertical arrangement was, "They are right behind that tree; go get them."  That is a little difficult when all you can
see is ten thousand trees.  That is a real problem because today we can make the same kind of information available in the
flip-down monocle on a soldier s helmet as you have in the battalion command post and in the hands of the brigade,
division and corps commander.  The real challenge is:  How do you use that information, how much do you need and
when? 
<P>  A second way to use information is to link sensors to shooters more rapidly.  Where it is feasible and smart to not have
a human in the loop, we ve taken him out.  There are some places where it is not smart to do that.  You may want an
override in some cases, but not all things.  
<P>  We are into "enroute rehearsal" business.  Today in a HMMWV with four missiles on the back, you can flip down the
console in the shotgun driver s seat, and with a key board , you can rehearse 26 scenarios enroute to wherever you need
to shoot that missile.  When you get there, just flip one switch, and it goes hot, and you shoot the missile. 
<P>You've had "embedded training" for years.  It is the last thing that happens on every watch in an aircraft carrier.  They
put the disk in and exercise during the last ten miutes of every watch.  We learned all that.  It all boils down to real-time
situational awareness   where we know where you are and we know where we are.  It s a wonderful new thing.  How does
that change the way we fight?   
<P>  We think there are six steps in this process.  This is viewed from the ground commander s perspective, but never from
the ground commander alone because we don t intend to fight alone.  We have to project our force and that means tailoring,
modularity, strategic lift, and training.  We have to protect it, and that is everything from a flak jacket to satellites and
everything in between.  We have the capability to gain information dominance on the battlefield   overmatch the
opposition s ability to pass information, protect ours, and disrupt the enemy's.  That is security jamming technology.  We
think we need to spend time learning how to shape the battlespace with simultaneity, and air-ground, not alone.  We are
going to retain a capability for decisive ground operations because there are places where tanks, armored personnel carriers
and ultimately individual soldiers are the right answer.  And, finally, we must be able to sustain and transition our forces
from operation to operation.  
<P>  What did we learn? We learned that this is not just putting appliques and screens on our equipment.  We learned that
this requires a full fabric mosaic.  It is a puzzle and we ve learned a lot of things from those three paths.  Well, we have
a stack of manuals that are about digitized squads, platoons, companies, battalions, brigades, and divisions, and they are
in the hands of the 4th Infantry Division today at Fort Hood, Texas.  That is our experimental force. 
 <P> We are putting 51 new end items into that division, rolling in on rail cars as we sit here.  We are digitizing the division
from the individual soldier to the division commander.  We ll have that all pulled together by the first of June.  From the
first of June of this year until February of next year, that division will train so we will see a new ground force of the 21st
century, or as close as we can make it.  Then next February, we ll take it to the National Training Center and fight against
the OPFOR.  Based on the outcome, we intend to buy only those things that are crucially important.  We hope that process
will tell us what is not a good idea as well as what is a good idea.  We hope to put it in the 98-03 POM, and put it into the
force about the turn of the century and have it last until 2015. 
<P>  That is a snapshot of our Force XXI.  
<P>  I can't resist telling you one personal thing about the Air Force.  I've had the privilege of serving in four wars during
my 33 years of service.  I was a young company commander in the first one.  I can t remember the face, but I remember
the call sign, "Cherub Zero Three" because it was my link to Phantoms and all of the other things in the air that were so
vital.  In a later iteration as an advisor to a Vietnamese unit, I learned that an A-1E is a wonderful platform because it is
slow, stays a long time and carries a lot of ammunition.  In Panama, we put 247 planes in the air at one time at night, and
I watched professional airmen make sure they did what they were supposed to do.  It was a faultless plan.  In Haiti, just
a year and a half ago, when we were all bobbing around in the sea trying to get Mister Cedras to leave, and he wasn t about
to leave untl he got a phone call from somewhere close to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, and someone said to him, "You
might want to reconsider; the C-5s are taking off."  It took him about 10 minutes to leave.  
  I thank you for letting me talk.  I listened very carefully to your Chief s words today.  He s got it just right.  He used
the word asymmetrical.  I am an infantryman.  I understand what it means to swing a 12-pound sledgehammer at a carpet
tack.  It works pretty well. Before you start the questions, I would say one more heartfelt thing.  I even understand what
a sledgehammer is, but it is most comforting to understand that the head of that hammer is the Air Force.
<P>
  <I>GEN. SHAUD:</I>  How would you assess the current status of joint Army-Air Force training and what do you envision for
the future?
<P> <I>GEN. HARTZOG:</I>  I ll answer that in two parts.  Anecdotally and situationally there are places where it is excellent.  Our
unit training, where we do interservice or joint training is really in two parts.  One is home station training at Fort Riley,
Kansas, at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, etc.  We have places where Army-Air Force home station training is a way of life. 
Fort Bragg with the Composite Wing, 82nd Airborne Division, 18th Airborne Corps, would never think of going to an
exercise without appropriate air cover.  It just would not occur.  There are some places within our home station
environment where it is not as robust as it should be.  
<P>  Second, we put all of our heavy units through the National Training Center at Fort Irwin [Calif.], all of our light units
through the Joint Readiness Training Center at Fort Polk [La.] and all of our European units through the CTC at
Hoehenfels.  At each of those places, we have a heavy resident partnership with the Air Force.  Air Warrior has been on
the ground at the National Training Center at Irwin and flown out of Nellis [AFB, Nev.] and other places for years.  It is
progressing, in my judgment, rapidly and at the right pace.  In both places, using lasers you can now shoot down an aircraft
or an aircraft can kill on the ground.  
<P>  It was a long time coming because it was a tough technical problem.  We can do it now with assurance that makes for
a very real battlespace, both air and ground.  The next challenge immediately before us is to link our simulations better than
we have done before.  We had a good exercise in Atlantic Resolve in 1994.  We are spending the money now to link
Twenty-nine Palms [Calif.] and Nellis and the Western Ranges with the National Training Center.  Eventually, we will
both come to the conclusion that we won t be able to afford to bring students to institutions anymore, but we ll have to pipe
the training to the students wherever they are and link it together with more facility than we have in the past.  I d rate us
in the "C" category or "C plus" and sort of spotty across the local training which mostly has to do with resources.  I d give
us an "A minus" in the training centers and the card is blank on the future of how well we can put the simulations together.
<P>  <I>GEN SHAUD:</I> Concerning operations other than war, as you prepare your troops for peacekeeping as opposed to
combat operations, is that having an impact on your readiness?
<P> <I>GEN. HARTZOG:</I>  First, I absolutely hate the term "operations other than war."  I don t propose to change it because too
many people understand what it is and none of the alternatives were very good, such as low intensity conflict, etc.  When
going into a situation currently characterized as "operations other than war" where there are belligerents on the battlefield
such as Somalia, Haiti, or Rwanda, you must go there with the attitude that you are prepared to be overwhelming, and you
have at least a mental sledge hammer in your pack.  
 <P> In most cases, the Army has tried to deal with that by having different types of units.  We pick the right kind of unit to
go, and have it fully trained to do its battle mission when it arrives.  That works for about the first month or so.  But if your
standard stock is patrolling a city and doing what is closer to police functions than military functions, your ability to sustain
all of the skills is not easy.  TRADOC has worked on that.  We put a lot of training ranges in Haiti.  We put a lot of training
ranges in Kuwait, and we already have put training ranges in Bosnia so the local commanders, as they rotate through the
operational period, can rotate through a training cycle and keep the interest and the skills of their troops high as well as
interperse new people as they rotate in.  It is a challenge, but you have to work at sustainment of training throughout
operations.
<P><I>GEN. SHAUD:</I>  How would you assess the performance of the C-17 in Bosnia from the Army s perspective?
 <P> <I>GEN. HARTZOG:</I> The C-17 is a hero to the Army.  I had the privilege to serve on the first requirements panel for the
aircraft back in the early 1980s.  We were thinking then about landing the C-17 on an autobahn and how many places you
could put it to load without having to kneel.  It is a hero.  We would not be in theater if it were not for the C-17.   It s a
wonderful plane, well put together, and I must tell you a story.  
<P>  I was at Fort Knox [Ky.] not long ago.  They had a big demonstration of new equipment, and they flew in the C-17 for
the local folks to see it.  They also flew in a C-47 from the Confederate Air Force.  I crawled into the front of the C-47 and
sat with the pilot a little bit.  He was parked exactly at the tail of the C-17.  When he tried to look out the window of the
C-47, he could not see the top of the C-17.  The man had tears running down his face.  This was an old, gray-haired pilot
who probably flew in World War II and was probably in his 80s.  It was so profound when he realized you could put the
C-47 into the back of the C-17 by trimming off about two feet of the wing on each side.  He just couldn t handle it, and
I couldn t either.  It was astounding.  
<P><I>GEN. SHAUD:</I>  Thank you very much for joining us; it has been our honor.

General Richard E. Hawley<BR>
Commander, U.S. Air Forces in Europe<BR>
Why Forward Presence?<BR>
Orlando AFA Symposium<BR>
February 15, 1996<P>

  As is often true,  where you stand depends on where you sit.  Right now, I sit at Ramstein.  I thought maybe I ought to
talk to you a little a bit about forward presence.  Maybe I ll phrase that a little differently to "forward stationing" and
discuss why it is so important to our nation and to our national strategy.  
<P>  What prompted me to want to talk about forward presence?  It came after reading a few articles that talk about this
bastion theory   there are some defense thinkers these days who have postulated that we can have this force structure that
can sit in the United States and be ready to respond on a moment s notice to a crisis any place in the world.  It says we ll
deploy them rapidly forward with our tremendous mobility capability, and we ll support them with long-range air power
and the flexibility of our sea-based forces.  Therefore, it implies we can free up these entanglements that we have all over
the world where we are basing forces and maybe even save money in the process.  By the way, it also implies we can keep
a few congressional districts because we can take forces down overseas rather than some place in CONUS.  Being that you
stand where you sit, I ought to take that issue on.     That is what I d like to do today. 
<P>  When I hear people talking about why it is necessary to still have forces overseas in Europe, Japan and Korea, I am
reminded of a saying by George Kenney who is one of our air power legends.  He said, "History is not kind to nations that
go to sleep."  When I hear people questioning the wisdom of maintaining an overseas presence, I wonder if maybe we are
not in danger of going to sleep and we need a little prod now and then to keep us awake. 
 <P> Forward presence is a very complex and sometimes emotional issue.  I don t think there should be any question
concerning its importance, either to our national military strategy, or to the long-term interests of the United States.  The
debate often seems to focus on how best to achieve forward presence, not on the basic need for it, and that is good, but I
sometimes fear that in our zeal to exploit the potential of some of these newly emerging technologies, we might lose sight
of the more subtle benefits that in some cases can only be realized by having forces on the ground and in the air over areas
of vital interest to our country.
<P>  There are some visionaries who foresee a future in which our great nation pursues its national interests using only forces
based in the United States, in space, and in that place I really don t understand yet called cyberspace.  Those increasingly
robust capabilities represented by our space-based forces, our long-range bombers, the demonstrated capability of our
strategic airlift forces to deliver fighter and support forcesquickly as well as our ground forces, lend credibility to these
visions.  We have a lot of capability to deploy very capable forces forward very quickly.  
<P>
  I have to tell you as one who has been overseas for about 10 of the last 15 years, I would counsel caution as we chart
our course for the next century.  Our great nation, in cooperation with allies and friends across the globe, has led this world
through half a century of unparalleled danger to the future of mankind.  We ve emerged into a new dawn, if I can steal that
tired old phrase.  One in which the threat to our national survival does not seem very large.  
<P>  The threats are not gone.  They are just more distant.  The threat of nuclear war has not been erased.  It is only less
prominent.  The ethnic and religious rivalries that have spawned so much grief for mankind have not abated, they have only
increased.  In fact, they are more volatile now than at any time since the end of World War II.  The demise of the Soviet
Union has not lessened the need for an active foreign policy.  Indeed, the proliferation of U.S. interests around the globe
underscores the growing need for an active U.S. role in the affairs of the world.  
 <P> The question should not be whether we need to be actively engaged, but only how we should pursue that engagement. 
I argue that we must maintain a balanced approach in our pursuit of engagement, one that most certainly takes advantage
of the capabilities that emerging technologies represent, but also is one that recognizes the unique contributions that flow
only from forces forward based in strategic regions of this shrinking globe.  There are some things that can only be done
by forces based in the region of interest.  What we need is an appropriate balance that maximizes our capability to influence
the course of world events in ways that make this a more secure world for this country of ours.
<P>  I suspect many of you have grown weary of hearing folks like me raise the specter of another great war in Europe should
we abandon our policy of engagement in the affairs of the world.  Please forgive me for quickly reviewing the events of
this century that we are about to put to bed, if you fall in that category.  There have been two great world wars in this
century, the second of which was in many ways a continuation of the first.  Those two wars killed nearly 86 million people
and set back mankind s progress for many decades.  
<P>
  In the two cold war conflicts that followed, Korea and Vietnam, nearly 100,000 Americans lost their lives.  So you d
think we had learned our lesson, but sometimes I am not sure.  In a recent Los Angeles Times article, Jim Mann related an
episode in which the ministers of defense of the UK, Norway, and the Netherlands visited Capitol Hill only to find an
empty house.  Not one Congressional representative showed up at a reception held in their honor.  Moving to the Senate,
they were welcomed by only one of the 18 foreign elations committee members who had been invited to meet them.  Mann
quotes a senior representative as saying, "There is a feeling now with the end of the cold war, that there are not many vital
American interests anywhere in the world."
<P>  How wrong that feeling is.  Maybe we should spend some time reviewing those important lessons of history.  As we
do, it is hard not to be struck by the many similarities between the world that existed in the first decade of this century and
the world as we know it today as that century is about to close.  There is tension in the Middle East, crisis in North and
Central Africa, conflict in the Caucaus and in the Balkans, and the seeds of revolution seem to be growing in Russia.  Does
that describe the world of 1906 or of 1996?  In fact, it pretty accurately describes both.  
<P>  The differences are not that great in many respects, but there is one very important difference:  we now have some
structures in place that can keep localized conflicts from affecting Great Power interests in ways that jeopardize world
peace.  
<P>  Our network of global alliances is central to that structure for peace   NATO is the most prominent of those alliances,
but it is by no means the only one.  Our bilateral treaties with Japan, South Korea and others are equally important.  The
one common thread that holds this delicate structure for peace together is the presence of U.S. forces on the ground, on
the seas and in the air, in regions where local tensions and Great Power interests converge in ways that pose a threat to
global peace.  
 <P> In the aftermath of World War I, the so-called "war to end all wars," having lost more than 100,000 Americans in
combat, our nation eagerly returned to a policy of isolationism and left Europe to fend for itself.  Having rejected
membership in the League of Nations and a policy of collective defense, the United States sent a strong message to the
world, a message that we were unwilling to step forward and provide global leadership to a region plagued with conflict. 
 <P> That, unfortunately, proved to be a serious mistake.  As General Douglas MacArthur once said, "There is no security
on this earth; there is only opportunity."  Our missed opportunity and lack of vision opened the door to madmen who were
intent on ruling the world or destroying it in that attempt.  
<P>  Our failure to stay engaged helped create the conditions for renewed conflict in Europe and throughout the world, a
conflict that cost the lives of almost half a million fighting men and women and snuffed out the lives of 60 million others
while devestating most of the industrialized world.  That happened within most of our lifetimes.
<P>  Our experiences in Korea and Vietnam should further reinforce the lesson that a strategy of peacetime engagement is
the best and least expensive way to protect vital American interests around the globe.  Would those wars have occured at
all if we had been more actively engaged in those regions before they began?  If we had maintained a stronger presence
in South Korea, as we do today, would North Korea ever have crossed the 38th Parallel?  One can only wonder how our
decision making in Vietnam might hae been altered if we had more students of Southeast Asian history and politics inside
the State Department and our Pentagon. 
<P>  With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the elimination of the threat of invasion of Western Europe, we again faced
a clear policy choice.  We could either disengage and withdraw our overseas based forces, or stay with the strategy of
engagement that had proven so successful and maintain enough forward-based forces to underwrite that strategy. 
Fortunately, we chose the latter, and the hopes for peace that glimmer  today in the former Republic of Yugoslavia, the
halting moves toward peace and stability that we are witnessing on the Korean Peninsula and the steady progress that we
are seeing in the Middle East are the direct results of that wise choice.
<P>  We have learned the lessons of history.  We will continue to use our influence to shape events in ways that will help
bring this century of conflict to a peaceful close.  
<P>  But there remains a wide range of opinion on how best to implement that strategy of engagement, and not all seem
convinced of the need to keep meaningful U.S. military presence deployed overseas at a time when so many problems cry
out for solution here at home.  Could we not place much greater reliance on virtual presence from space and cyberspace? 
Can't CONUS-based bombers armed with precision munitions, those GATS-GAM [GPS Aided Targeting System-GPS
Aided Munition] weapons the Chief talked about, carry more of the load?  Don t our substantial investments in mobility
forces give us the capability to quickly move forces to a theater in conflict?  Of course, they do.  They all contribute to our
ability to successfully implement a strategy of engagement.  
<P>  But let's not lose sight of the critical role played by forces permanently deployed forward in regions of potential
instability, like Europe, where U.S. vital interests are clearly at risk.  These forward deployed forces do some things that
no other weapon in our policy arsenal can do.  They give us a seat at the table, usually the most influential seat, when issues
of interest to the U.S. are being debated.  They sustain our system of alliances, which in turn allows us to leverage the
military capabilities of allies in pursuit of common interests.  They preserve our access to bases, ports and airfields without
which we might not even have the option to engage.  
<P>  They give us a pool of regional experts, both in and out of uniform and frequently very senior experts, who have served
with leaders in the region of interest and who often make the difference between a policy that has an opportunity to succeed
and one that is doomed from the start.  They allow us to respond quickly with force in times of crisis and to more
effectively sustain prolonged engagements, such as operation Provide Comfort in Northern Iraq, Provide Promise in
Sarajevo and Joint Endeavor in Bosnia.  
<P>  Let's look at each of these attributes of our forward deployed forces in turn.  First is having a seat at the table when
important policy issues are being debated.  Does anyone here believe that we could have played such a prominent role in
setting U.N. and NATO policy toward the conflict in the former Yugoslavia if we had completely withdrawn our forces
from Europe after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989?  
<P>  Would we be playing such a prominent role in shaping the structure of peace in the Middle East today if we had not
cmmitted our forces in response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and kept them engaged in that region ever since? 
Would we have had the same influence in the search for peaceful ways to resolve the 45-year-long dispute between the two
Koreas if we had not maintained our land, sea and air presence in that vital region?  For me the answer to each of these
questions is very clear and it is, "No."
<P>  Next is the role our forward-based forces play in sustaining our system of alliances and in leveraging the capabilities
of allies in pursuit of our common interest.  As we sit here in the United States, we often overlook those very important
contributions that our allies have made to some of our greatest military and policy successes.  Naturally, our immediate
focus is on the contributions of our own forces because that is what interests us in our hometown, but our allies and friends
contributed a quarter of the forces that engaged Saddam Hussein s armies during Desert Shield and Desert Storm.  
<P>  Allied navies contribute 90 percent of the ships that are enforcing the arms embargo of the warring factions in the former
Yugoslavia.  Allied air forces contribute over 50 percent of the aircraft that are flying in Decisive Endeavor and that flew
in Deliberate Force and Deny Flight before that effort began.  Allied armies represent more than 70 percent of the ground
force that is separating the warring factions in Bosnia today.  
<P>  As impressive as those numbers are, they do not tell the whole story.  Because we have kept forces in those regions of
the world where our interests are threatened by local tensions and conflict, we know how to work with the forces of our
friends and allies.  Those forces generally operate under compatible doctrine,tactics and procedures.  In many cases they
have equipped their forces with weapons of U.S. manufacture, a huge advantage when we operate together.  
<P>  The most widely recognized benefit I ve cited is access to the base infrastructure that is so critical to the success of any
military operation.  Our current airlift operations in support of the 1st Armored Division s deployment to Bosnia could
never have happened if we had not had access to aerial ports at Rhein Mein and Ramstein [AB, Germany].  If that division
had not already been forward deployed, we would have been faced with the imposing prospect of having to move the entire
force from the United States by air and sea.  Any of us who have watched that division deploy over the past two months
and more can t help but wonder how much longer that would have taken.  
<P>  We would have had to move that force through intermediate ports and airfields that would have required their own
additional force structure and lift to facilitize them for the reception and onward movement of the division.  We would have
needed additional time to negotiate the use of those facilities.  And, of course, the deployment itself would have taken a
lot longer.  It is about a one-month trip from the U.S. to the Adriatic.  My guess is we are talking about an additional month
to six weeks at a time when policy makers were haggling over days and hours.  If you want to put the fire out while it is
still small, you had better have a firehouse that is close to the action.  Fortunately, in this case, we had a firehouse that was
close to the action.
<P>  Now for that intangible benefit of forward deployed forces, called regional expertise.  This one won t make the charts
of anyone s cost effectiveness analysis.  But it may well be the most important benefit that we derive from our long-term
strategy of keeping forces forward deployed in regions of critical interest to our country.  One of the classic mistakes that
we make in formulating policy under crisis conditions is that of mirror imaging our adversary.  By that I mean we often
assume our adversary will view the world in the same way that we do and will respond in predictable ways to our actions. 
That is usually not the way it works.  We are far less likely to fall prey to this policy trap if we have policy makers and
advisors who have served in the region of interest, who have worked with some of the engaged forces and who know some
of the leaders, leaders who drive the policies of our protagonists as well as our allies.  
<P> I can think of no better example of this benefit than the role currently being played by my boss, General George Joulwan,
in the formulation of both U.S. and NATO policies toward the former Yugoslavia.  You might say, "I thought the Chief
was your boss."  Well, I ve got two bosses.  I have a NATO hat and a EUCOM hat, and in those hats, I work for General
Joulwan.  Few would argue that George has not played a pivotal role, and it is no accident that he is drawing on nearly 15
years of service in Europe.  How much more prone to mistakes would we have been had we not had that resevoir of
experience to draw on in this crisis situation? 
<P>  Finally, the issue that so often we focus on is the issue of dollars and cents.  In fact, there is not a cost associated with
our forward deployed forces.  There is actually a cost benefit.  Many people cite the cost of maintaining our forces overseas
as though they are more expensive than they would be if based in the United States.  That is simply not true.  The only way
we can save money by withdrawing forces from overseas is if we decommission them and put them in the boneyard.  
<P>  In every theater where we maintain a forward presence, a significant fraction of our total stationing costs are borne by
our friends and allies in the region.  Let s not forget that time and distance can be talked about in terms of money.  When
I send a squadron from Germany to Turkey in support of operation Provide Comfort, the deployment costs about $175,000. 
When we support that same mission from Hill Air Force Base in Utah, it costs about three-quarters of a million dollars. 
So when we get frustrated by the hard, grinding work that it takes to maintain a diplomatic environment that is receptive
to our forward based strategy; when we are tempted by the siren song of technology that promises to free us of the need
for entangling alliances; and when the pressures of a declining budget prompt us to look overseas for force structure
reductions in order to spare those closer to home, let us keep in mind the enormous benefits that our nation, and indeed
the whole world, has gleaned from our nearly five decade-long committment to a strategy of engagement built around a
robust, forward deployed presence.
<P>  In closing, let me ask for one small favor from this audience because I know many of you can exert influence in one
of my favorite places, Capitol Hill.  I need some help.  We have 73,000 Air Fore people and family members living in
Europe today.  They are deployed more frequently to contingency operations than any other part of our force, yet they are
living and working in some of the worst facilities to be found anywhere in our Air Force.  After the fall of the Berlin Wall,
we stopped investing in new facilities in Europe.  We didn t want to risk pouring good money into installations that might
soon be closed down.  That was a smart thing to do.
<P>  But that period of uncertainty is now over.  We know with some confidence what our posture in Europe will be for the
next decade or so and it is time to fulfill our obligation to give our people facilities that meet Air Force standards and are
able to support the missions that we call upon them to do.  Our people in Europe don t live in anyone s congressional
district so their needs sometimes get pushed to the bottom of the stack.  I, and they, would appreciate your help in keeping
that from happening.  
<P>  Ok, enough talk about forward presence.  I suspect many of you would like to ask a question, perhaps about our ongoing
operations in Bosnia.  I would be happy to deal with those at this time.  Thank you.
<P>
<I>GEN. SHAUD:</I>  As you might suspect, the questions are in two categories:  Europe and with acquisition.  Let me start
with a question that all European generals get on France.  France s President Chirac recently recommended NATO
reforms to allow European allies to play a more active role without U.S. participation.  Do you see any changes in NATO
and are some changes desirable in this regard?
<P>  <I>GEN. HAWLEY:</I>  We are seeing a lot of change in the relationship between France and NATO.  I think France,  NATO
and the United States are in the midst of a way to better integrate France into the NATO military structure that will protect
the long-term interests of the United States, the NATO alliance and France.  President Chirac s recent meeting with
President Clinton is a clear indicator that France is reexamining the policy established by President De Gaulle some years
ago.  In fact, in my AIRCENT headquarters, which is my NATO hat, we have long had a French liaison element.  That
French liaison element was there to facilitate military planning and cooperation between the forces committed to NATO
on a day-to-day basis and those of France.  
<P>  I recently signed a memorandum of understanding with the commander of the French combat air forces to cement the
procedures and rules under which the NATO forces of AIRCENT and his forces would work in times of crisis in the central
region.  The French liaison element which until now lived in a building remotely located on Ramstein [Air Base, Germany]
is in the process of moving into my headquarters.  We see daily increased cooperation.  We exercise with the French Air
Force.  Our most recent tactical air meet was held in France.  I see a lot of cooperation; it is increasing every day.  
<P>  The policy issues are working toward resolution.  It will take awhile, and it will be slow, but I think we are going to
make steady progress.  We ll end up with a situation in which both France s long-term interests and those of the United
States and the rest of the NATO nations will be well served.  
<P><I>GEN. SHAUD:</I>  We'll take you up on your offer to talk about Bosnia.  Can you characterize air operations,
Post-Deliberate Force, as they are going on today?
<P><I>GEN. HAWLEY:</I>  We have been in a period of steady transition from the more than two years of Deny Flight, with
on-again, off-again hot spots like Deliberate Force, which culminated that period.  The focus is now on our forces deployed
on the ground.  We have transitioned from the time up to and including Deliberate Force, where we were trying to apply
air power to influence the adversaries in the former Yugoslavia with virtually air power alone, to a time where we are
clearly in direct support of our forces on the ground.  
<P>  We now have JSTARS [E-8 Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar System] deployed.  It flies every day and is
doing great.  I don t think we ve lost one day.  We haven t even lost an hour of a planned sortie due to breakdowns in the
platform.  We are doing a great job.  Air lift has been our prominent role as we helped to deploy the 1st Armored Division,
even though most of it went by train and road.  Establishing the airheads at Tuzla and Taszar was a big effort on our part. 
<P>
  The airlift flow got the immediate force on the ground at Tuzla and then has played a big role in deploying the forces
into Taszar as a stage forward has been our big focus.  
<P>  We continue to fly in a Deny Flight-like manner to patrol the skies over the former Yugoslavia.  In at least two cases
where our young company-level commanders on the ground were confronted with belligerent participants, whether they
be Serbs, Bosnians or Croats, the two commanders had the presence of mind to call on air power to fly overhead. It shows
how the air power message really is getting across.  In one case, they flew over supersonic just to get their attention.  They
let tose adversaries know that if they keep violating the terms of the Dayton Accord, there are some guys who are going
to make life pretty unpleasant.  It worked in both cases.  
<P>  Air power has been very effective and I couldn t be prouder of the men and women of our Air Force who have made
this operation virtually incident free.  We could not have carried on a peacetime exercise for this period of time without
hurting more people and damaging more equipment than we have done in this exercise.  It has been virtually incident free. 
<P>
  <I>GEN. SHAUD:</I>  The next question concerns basic troop strength and the base structure in Europe.  Has it stabilized or
do you visualize more change in the future?
 <P><I>GEN. HAWLEY:</I>  I think it has stabilized, but it needs some fine tuning.  As you know, we drew down our forces in Europe
very quickly.  In the process of drawing them down, we realigned forces all over the command and created some anomalies
in the support structure   things like our forces in Italy not having any range to work on day-to-day.  We need to figure
out a way to get them access to a gunnery range where they can do that kind of backyard range work that everybody needs. 
<P>
  Certainly we have facility problems all over the command, which is why I made that closing plea for some support in
that area.  In terms of the overall numbers, we are about there.  We are going to end up at the end of this year with about
27,000 people in USAFE, and another 5,000 Air Force people in other commands in Europe.  I don t see it going any
further south for at least some period of time.  Certainly not as long as the political and contingency situation exists as we
see it today.  
<P>  We are stretched very thin.  While I am on the subject, I need to give credit to the rest of the Air Force, in particular the
Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve, for the support they give our contingencies in our theater of operations
day-to-day.  When I review their presence in my command on any given day, I have anywhere from 700 to 1,100 Air Force
Guardsmen and Reservists in theater flying missions, installing communications and doing great work for us.  It is a Total
Air Force effort.
<P><I>GEN. SHAUD:</I>  How would you assess the capabilities of the Rafale fighter and the progress, prospects and capabilities
of the EF-2000?
<P><I>GEN. HAWLEY:</I>  I haven t had the pleasure of flying either of those airplanes, so I don t have any additional data on the
Rafale or the 2000 that you don t have.  I will refrain from trying to compare them to any U.S. system.  Both the French
with the Rafale and the consortium that is building the EF-2000 are doing their very best to put together airplanes that will
serve their needs in the next century.  It is clear that there is interest in Europe in sustaining their defense industrial base
just as there is interest in our country in sustaining our defense industrial base.
<P>  It is very difficult for the nations in Europe to produce systems on a par with the emerging system that we are talking
about building in this country, like the F-22.  I don t see the Rafale and the 2000 being in the F-22 s class.  But they will
certainly be in the F-15/16/18 class.  They are going to be very good fighter aircraft with very good weapons.  If I know
my French friends very well, the Raphael in particular will have superb avionics.  They do a great job in that area.  They
are going to be formidable airplanes and unfortunately, they will probably sell to anyone who has a fat wallet to buy one
of them.  We need to think about that as we look to our own modernization program over the course of the next ten years. 
There is going to be a lot of competition out there.
<P><I>GEN. SHAUD:</I>  The last question has to do with GPS.  What do you perceive to be the current position of the allies
regarding GPS?  Many host nation governments don t want to rely on U.S. controlled systems to land aircraft in bad
weather.  Is this an interoperability issue and have you had to address it?
<P><I>GEN. HAWLEY:</I>  It has not really arisen on my watch in Europe, but I do hear some concerns about our policies regarding
GPS.  That has to do with our deprtmental requirement that we maintain control of the system and in particular be able to
adjust its accuracy in time of crisis.  Frankly, I think GPS is going to have a life of its own and everybody in the world will
be using it.  When I was in Japan and before I went to the Air Force Acquisition job a few years ago, I was invited to visit
a guy on the east coast of Japan who had a fishing boat.  He took me out in the fishing boat.  In this boat, he had a GPS
installed with a moving map display and a sonar and he could plot his position anywhere in that region down to a couple
of feet and get to any place where somebody said there were fish to catch.  GPS is everywhere.  It is only a matter of time
before it is probably the sole means of navigation for all kinds of purposes around the world.
<P><I>GEN. SHAUD:</I>  Thank you very much and give our best to our troops in Europe.

General Joseph W. Ralston<BR>
Commander, Air Combat Command<BR>
Charting the Future of the Combat Air Force<BR>
Orlando AFA Symposium<BR>
February 16, 1996<BR>
<P>

  I am pleased to be with you today.  ACC is honored to be a part of sponsoring this symposium.  Of all of the great AFA
symposiums around the country, I really believe this is one that does the best job of bringing the senior leadership of the
Air Force and industry partners together.  That is a very important aspect of our process.  
<P>  We have to communicate between industry and our Air Force in better ways than we have.  You don t do that with RFPs
and proposals.  You don t do it with requirements.  We ve had some great requirements writers, the best in the business
being here today   General Bob Russ, General Jimmy Adams and General John Jaquish.  I know enough about that
process as I ve written a couple in my life and it is an imperfect process at best.  You must have the personal interaction
between industry and the military like we have had here the last couple of years to do that.
<P>  Yesterday, the Chief gave us the vision of where we are going as an Air Force of the future   the intellectual
underpinnings of that vision.  This morning, Secretary Widnall gave us a good look at what your U.S. Air Force is doing
around the world.  I would like to talk with you about Air Combat Command s future and the programs important to Air
Combat Command and our Air Force.
<P>  I  have to set the stage a bit before I do that.  Many in this audience were around in the 1970s, which was the last time
that our military establishment faced the type of budgetary pressures anything like we are experiencing now.  In my view,
we made some decisions that were not very good in the 70s.  We elected to keep every base that we had open.  We elected
to keep every squadron that we had on the books.  The budget wouldn t support that and the only way we could do it was
to cut flying hours and to cut spare parts.  
<P>  As those of you who were around at that time know, that was a disaster.   At the time, our pilots in Tactical Air
Command were getting 7-8 flying hours a month.  They were not combat ready.  They knew they were not combat ready,
and they left the service in great numbers.  We had to retrain a new "Six Million Dollar Man" by going through the whole
cycle again.  Our maintenance people, who like nothing better than to fix broken airplanes, would go to the spare parts bin
and there were no spare parts.  They were demoralized.  Retention suffered and we were in bad shape.  
<P>  Those of us who were squadron commanders during the 70s said,"If we are ever in the position to face that same
situation, we ll make a different set of decisions."  That is why you have seen the Air Force closing bases   as painful as
it is.  We have taken squadrons off the books, going from almost 40 wings to 20 wings, and we cut our bomber force by
two thirds.  As painful as that is, it gives us the flying hours and th spare parts to make what we have truly combat ready. 
We have done that and I think it was the right decision to make.  
<P>  We do not want to cut Operations & Maintenance funds anymore.  Yet, we must modernize for the future.  At best, we
are in a zero-sum game.  I say that to set the framework as we approach the Fiscal Year 1998 Program Objective
Memorandum. With all of the programs we have funded today   and, as you know, we have made significant cuts to
this point we are facing today a $4.5 billion disconnect bill just for the programs that we have on the books.  If anyone
comes forward with a new grand idea, we re going to have to kill something in order to proceed with the grand idea, no
matter how good it is.  I believe the "blue suiters" have an obligation to tell industry: "When you are about to spend your
discretionary dollars on a program, it certainly needs to be one that has some prayer of success in terms of the overall
funding."
<P>  With that in mind, for those programs that Air Combat Command feels are important to our future and ones we have
fully funded today, if anything else pops into that line, then something I m going to talk about is going to have to pop out. 
That is the framework for today s talk.
<P>  First of all is the F-22.  I don t need to spend a long time on the F-22.  As the Chief said yesterday, it is our number one
modernization program, certainly in Air Combat Command and in the Air Force.  We need the F-22 not to provide air
superiority for Air Combat Command and not to provide air superiority for the Air Force, but to provide air superiority
for America.  It will do that for the first half of the 21st Century.  That is not an overstatement.  It will be around that long. 
We have to keep it on track.  It is absolutely fundamental.  
<P>  The F-15 has served us extremely well for a number of years.  Many of you have heard me talk about that before.  It has
been airborne now for 24 years.  That is not when it was designed.  That is not when the technology was frozen, but it has
been airborne for 24 years.  Yet, we are still nine years away from the first combat F-22 replacement.  
<P>  We have to do a few things to the F-15, but we can t do much.  We need to upgrade the radar.  The APG-63 radar has
been a great radar and has served us very well, but again, it is 1960s technology while we are late into the 90s and going
into the 21st Century.  So the upgrade is very important to us in order to get a handle on the cost of ownership.  
 <P> For the LINK-16, General Dick Hawley did a magnificent job when he was AQ [Air Force Acquisition] in getting the
price of JTIDS [Joint Tactical Information Distribution System] for LINK-16 down to an affordable level.  We suffered
a little hiccup in the program, but we are still strongly supportive of LINK-16 capability on the F-15.  I believe General
Muellner will keep MIDS on track as he has promised me, and that we will get an affordable MIDS program so that we
can put LINK-16 onto our F-15s.
<P>  Theater missile defense is the second program the Chief talked about yesterday, and a revolutionary system is the
Airborne Laser [ABL] program.  Air Combat Command has fully funded it to the concept demonstrator and we are looking
forward to its flight in 2001.  
<P>  ROCC and SOCC   the Region and Sector Operations Control Centers   modernization doesn t sound very exciting
to many, but to General Joe Ashy as CINC NORAD and to myself as a former NORAD region commander, it is absolutely
critical that we do that modernization.  For the first time in history we have fully funded that effort.  How many of you in
this room are doing work on a 30-year-old computer?  We just don t.  We can t do that any longer in the ROCC.  We ve
got to do better.  
<P>  Let's go to our airplane programs within force application.  The A-10 is still serving us extremely well and will continue
to do so as far into the future as I can see.  We need to do some mods to the A-10.  We ll add embedded GPS and the Army
has bought thousands and thousands of EPLARS [Enhanced Position Location Reporting System] radios.  I think it is very
important that our primary close air support airplane is on the same radio net as the Army with their EPLARS radio.  So
we have a funded program to put EPLARS onto the A-10.
<P>  For our Block 30 F-16s, night vision goggles and the lighting that goes with that and our weapons capability with 
JDAM [Joint Direct Attack Munition], wind-corrected munitions, and JSOW [Joint Standoff Weapon], are very important. 
For the same reasons we are looking at EPLARS on the A-10s, we have a funded program for EPLARS on our F-16 Block
30 and 40 programs.  
 <P> I would also like to see LINK-16 on the F-16.  Perhaps there is a way that you can do both.  I saw last evening there is
some technology where with a single box you can do EPLARS and LINK-16.  I am not saying that is the answer, but it
certainly is some innovative thinking we need to pursue and see if we can do that.  The same is true on our earlier model
F-16s where we are looking at the munitions improvements. 
<P>  We have our Block 50 F-16s with the HARM [High-Speed Anti-radiation Missile] Targeting System [HTS].  We are
extremely pleased with the system, and as you travel around the world and talk to the Block 50 HARM Targeting System
squadrons, without exception, they are very pleased with the system, and it is doing extremely well.  We are developing
some innovative tactics.  For example, through the IDM [Improved Data Modem], a non-HTS F-16 can receive a relay from
an HTS equipped F-16.  This information is so good, the wingman can use it to lock a Maverick missile on the target.  This
tactic is working very well.  
<P>  On our bomber programs, a priority for the B-1 is the conventional munitions upgrade where we need to give i modern
munitions capability and allow it to carry JDAM and the CBU series.  The defensive systems upgrade program is very
important.  We have to get this on the airplane so it can face the threat in the 21st Century.  I don t know exactly what the
answer is as it is fully funded right now.  We are certainly looking at IDECM [Integrated Defensive Electronic Counter
Measures System] as one of the possibilities for the B-1.
<P>  For BVUD, the virtual umbilical capability,  Congress in FY 96 added some dollars to the budget to give us an interim
capability so we can drop a JDAM-like weapon without having to put 1760 [data bus architecture] on the airplane.  At least
from Air Combat Command s perspective, we think that is probably a smart hedge to give us  precision attack capability
within the next two years.  
<P>  The B-2 is also a very important program for us, lest anybody believe that I am not a strong B-2 supporter and a strong
supporter of our bomber force.  We are working very hard to bring the B-2 on board with the capability that we all need. 
By next summer, we will have the GATS/GAM [GPS Aided Targeting System/GPS Aided Munition] capability on it, and
we intend to demonstrate it at that time.  We still have over $1.5 billion of our RDT&E to go on the B-2 program before
we have a good operational capability.  The Congress added $493 million and those decisions will be made in Washington
on how to spend that, but certainly we have at least that much funded to give us the existing program and the spare parts
we need for our 20 planes.  
<P>  For our weapons which we have already talked about, the JDAM is a real success story and I m sure  General Muellner
will talk more about that in a moment.  We are strongly supportive of the program and have fully funded it.  The same is
true for JASSM [Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile].  We have a program and we have funding.  The Sensor-Fused
Weapon is a very important program and one that we are very high on, and the AIM-9X is also fully funded.  
<P>  Within our surveillance and reconnaissance area, we have Joint STARS [Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar
System].  The Secretary talked about Joint STARS and its successful deployment to Sarajevo.  We flew the 50th sortie in
theater yesterday, breaking the record that George Muellner established in Desert Storm.  It is doing great things for us,
and we are very happy with the results.
<P>  The E-3 AWACS Extend Sentry program is critically important for us.  Every CINC around the world wants all of our
AWACS all of the time.  They can t have them, but we are doing what we can to provide as many sorties as possible and
are upgrading AWACS with Extend Sentry and the RSIP [Radar System Improvement Program] program is important to
do that.  
<P>  I'm not sure exactly wherewe are headed on RIVET JOINT.  We need some additional RIVET JOINT aircraft.  If the
Air Force were king, I m sure we would do that.  Congress added some money to reengine the existing ones and that is an
expensive program.  We must do some work to sort out exactly how we approach that as we go into the months ahead.  
<P>  I'm very proud of the UAVs [Unmanned Aerial Vehicle] and the people in the 11th Reconnaissance Squadron at Nellis
Air Force Base and Indian Springs [Nev.].  Secretary Perry [Honorable William J. Perry, SECDEF] was out there about
two weeks ago and he was kind enough to give me a call after he d had his visit to tell me that he had been a fan of UAVs
for a long time.  When he talked to the squadron commander at Nellis, Lieutenant Colonel Steve Hampton, he said Steve
was the most knowledgeable individual he had ever spoken to about UAVs.  He called to tell me how impressed he was
with the briefings and where the program was.  That is exactly what we wanted to do when we stood up the program and
get some people who work with UAVs every day to learn the challenges and the ways of integrating those systems into
our force structure.
<P>  The C-130Js are very important to us because we have a sizeable C-130 fleet that will be aging out of service, and we
need to bring the C-130J on board.  I am excited about the "J" model and what it can do for us.  
<P>  I've talked a lot this morning about hardware because that is the nature of the audience here, and I thought it was
important to give you an update on the programs we think are very important to the future of our Air Force and Air Combat
Command.  Even though I ve talked about hardware, our people in Air Combat Command today are performing
magnificently around the world.  Today we have 5,500 people who are TDY either to Southwest Asia, Turkey, Bosnia,
Haiti or SOUTHCOM.  They are doing a great job and our combat readiness is at an all-time high.  
 <P> I also can t close without acknowledging the great contribution the Air National Guard and the Air Force Reserve have
made to our mission.  We just flat could not do it without the magnificent contribution across the board.
<P>  I am extremely proud of our numbers in Air Combat Command with 94 percent of our squadrons rated C-1 or C-2.  That
is a very enviable number.  But a number that I am even prouder of is that 96 percent of our Air National Guard and Air
Force Reserve squadrons are C-1 or C-2.  So, they are doing a great job.
<P>  That is all I have for you, and I certainly look forward to entertaining any questions you may have.  
<P>
  <I>GEN. SHAUD:</I>  We first have an organizational question.  What is and what will be the relationship between Air Combat
Command and SAF/AQ in selecting funding assets and how does the priority practice really work?
<P><I>GEN. RALSTON:</I>  As in all of our better processes, we operate as a team and we work closely together.  Air Combat
Command sets priorities in terms of unfilled needs and requirements, and we try to be specific and publish those for the
system.  We also know that they are impacted by programmatic decisions, and we don t want to do something that could
break a program that is doing well.  
 <P> We may have to dip into one of our higher priority requirements to fund a program that is still a requirement, but we
don t want to break it.  We have to work issues in an iterative and a teamwork way.  We are doing that and feel very good
about it.  General Muellner will give you his perspective on that when he gets up.
 <P><I>GEN. SHAUD:</I>  In your opinion, should the CINCs be given greater control over the resource allocation process?
  <P><I>GEN. RALSTON:</I>  I applaud the Goldwater-Nichols initiatives, and we have a stronger military today because of it.  The
greatest aspect of the Goldwater-Nichols Act was to make the CINC in charge of his AOR.  He is the undisputed leader
in that area.  We have a structural balance to maintain, though.  The best CINC is one who concentrates on how to fight
the war this afternoon.  As a nation, that is what we pay him to do.  Sometimes they are not equipped with the staff that
they need to look 20 years into the future and to spend time concentrating on it.  The services probably have a better role
to play in that regard, but once again, it is not an "either/or" situation.  There needs to be a partnership and teamwork
arrangement as we do that.  The present process is working well in that regard.
 <P><I>GEN. SHAUD:</I>  Recently, the White House said the Defense Department is going to expand its forthcoming Deep Strike
Study to take a harder look at trade-offs between long-range bombers, land based and sea based tactical air power and
missiles.  Do you have any initial thoughts on this study or thoughts to share about it?
 <P><I>GEN. RALSTON:</I>  I think it is proper that the study take place and that they do a good look at it.  I am certain that it will
build heavily on the Heavy Bomber Study which was completed last year.  Air Combat Command and the Air Force were
full participants in that study.  We looked at many of those issues at that time.  I am certain they will get a fresh look and
the process should continue and proceed.
 <P><I>GEN. SHAUD:</I> What is the status of the B-52 and how long do you think it will remain a combat asset?
 <P><I>GEN. RALSTON:</I>My personal view is that the B-52 will remain a combat asset for a long time.  We have looked at its
service life and worked very closely with Boeing.  It s an interesting statistic that the average B-52H has fewer flying hours
and fewer landings than the average Boeing 767 in the commercial fleet.  The B-52 has a lot of life left in it.  It will last
for a long time.  I see no present plans to retire the B-52 for well beyond anybody s lifetime in this room, except the cadets
perhaps.
  <P><I>GEN. SHAUD:</I>As a final question Sir, can you provide us with your thoughts on the future hardened, deeply buried target
mission?
  <P><I>GEN. RALSTON:</I> That is a tough problem and one that we have worked for decades.  It is a problem that is not insolvable. 
Desert Storm brought to the forefront the best of our requirements and industrial processes.  When we needed a munition
that could go into deeply buried, hardened targets, in spite of not being able to have solved that problem for decades, we
put together a team between Lockheed and Texas Instruments that developed the GBU-28 in about 21 days.  It is something
that was tested; it workd; and it was employed in combat.  It certainly may not be the ultimate solution, but it is a combat
capability we have today to do the mission and that is all I would say.
 <P><I>GEN. SHAUD:</I>  We thank you very much and congratulations on your new assignment.<HR>

Lt. Gen. George K. Muellner<BR>
Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (Acquisition)<BR>
Orlando AFA Symposium<BR>
February 16, 1996<BR>
<P>
  I am very honored to have this opportunity to talk to you.  My presentation is now a lot shorter than it was a bit ago. 
The Chief covered two of my major points and General Ralston zeroed out the others.  
 <P>
 Our senior leadership and our decision makers on the agenda are those that set priorities, whether they be funding
priorities or specific requirements for weapons systems, while I represent the other end of the food chain, the acquisition
folks who try to make those priorities and funding applications a reality.  I am going to try to show how effective we are
at doing that, where we still have problems, and where we think we are going in the future.
 <P>
 Obviously, as all the previous speakers have highlighted, this is a very difficult geopolitical and economic time and
environment for us to operate in.  We have heard discussions about the high OPTEMPOs that continue to stress readiness
and to age our force.  At the same time, we are facing at best a zero-sum game and likely decreasing resources to meet those
needs.  The combination of these things makes the main focus of my presentation even more important.  
 <P>
 We must reform our acquisition and our procurement system to ensure we get the maximum bang for that buck  
taxpayers money   that we invest.  We need to ensure we get more "rubber on the ramp," in the silo, or whatever the
appropriate medium, when we start an acquisition program, and that we have an executable program throughout its life. 
As a part of this discussion, I m going to run through a number of programs, but I certainly don t mean to cover the entire
spectrum.  I am going to show some real success stories and a few others that have a ways to go, but are making progress. 
If I don t cover your program, I am sorry, and I d be glad to address it in the Q&A, all except the hard buried target issue. 
We are working that issue, and I d be glad to tell you about some of the issues we are working, but that is still a ways out. 
<P>

  For years, the Air Force has benefited from the finest products of the industrial base to give us a technological edge on
our adversaries.  That has benefited our warfighters, and that has benefited our allies.  The technology has been evident
in our products in the air, our weaponry, our command and control systems and all aspects of our warfighting capability. 
We shouldn t shy away from that.  We can t forget it.  This American way of warfighting has given us an  asymmetry on
the battlefield that s so important.  
 <P>
 As we have moved away from the Cold War, the resources to carry out that philosophy became less and less available. 
We started to face very hard decisions on how much of a given technology we could afford to put into a product.  We
started to think about not only delivering the best that technology could offer, but also making that technology affordable
in what we brought onto the battlefield.  We needed to prove NormAugustine wrong with his "techflation curve," by getting
off that curve and make high tech affordable for our warfighters and also for our allies.  
 <P>
 We made a lot of progress.  The programs I will cover in the next couple of minutes highlight that.  You will still see
there is a focus on effectively meeting the warfighter s needs, but to do so in a much more efficient manner   efficient
from the standpoint of delivery of the product to the acquisition system and efficient from the standpoint of the life cycle
support of that product while it continues to meet the warfighter s needs.  As we go through each program, you will find
we are not losing effectiveness, but we are adding efficiency.  
 <P>
 Let me start off with a program that has been discussed at great length already.  I don t need to talk about the
significance of this to our warfighters.  After Secretary Perry s recent visit to the Bosnia theater where he flew on the C-17,
he came back and gave us an extensive briefing on throughput and what this airplane means to our warfighter on the ramp. 
So, we know it is well understood, and that s true for President Clinton also.  This clearly is our premier procurement
program within the Department.  It is the highest priority of our warfighters.  
  <P>
This is a program that just a few years ago was in great trouble.  This was a program that was not delivering quality
products on time and those that were being delivered were fairly expensive, in excess of $330 million a copy.  This is a
program where government and industry got their act together.  We had strong leadership from McDonnell Douglas and
Don Koslowski and from the program manager, Maj. Gen. Ron Kadish, who worked this challenge very hard.  
 <P>
 The end result is what has become a model program.  Along the way they reduced contract deliverablesto less than 25
pieces of paper where initially we were getting 400 plus deliverables.  We went from 250 plus Specs on the program to
just 3.  We went from 80 plus mil standards down to a half dozen that apply.  The result has been savings of $4 billion
across the whole program.  If we get our multi-year procurement approved, the unit fly-away costs for each of these last
80 aircraft that have been approved will be $173 million a copy.  That is a radical change from that $330 million number
earlier.  That is what streamlining can do for you and is what good leadership and good management can do for you.
 <P>
 In industry, some say that approach works fine with big programs, but it doesn t work for small programs and things
that are well along the way.  This next program, which is also one that supports AMC [Air Mobility Command], proves
that wrong.  This program was mature; it provides the command and control for AMC to effect the planning, scheduling,
and execution of their airlift, tanker and aeromedical operations.  It was going into a large number of installations.  Through
the proper use of commercial, off-the-shelf hardware and the use of existing local area networks at each of those bases,
the cost of this program was dramatically reduced.  While not as large as others, we achieved a 44 percent reduction in the
cost of the program, and we were able to significantly accelerate the beddown.  So it works at all levels, and we are having
those sorts of success.  
<P>
  JPATS [Joint rimary Aircraft Training System] was one of the initial pilot programs to use the non-
developmental effort to fill our warfighters  needs.  This program, which we are happy to say is now under contract and
we are executing, allows us to save over $200 million just in the developmental aspects.  It is a program that is going to
deliver the replacement for the Air Force T-37 and Navy T-34.  A key aspect of this program is that "J".  You are going
to see I am going to talk about a lot of "Joint" programs.  It is a sign of the future and one we need to get more comfortable
with.  That is a real challenge some days, and I will talk about that more later.  
 <P>
 General Ralston certainly highlighted the significance of the F-22 program to the future of the Air Force and more
importantly to the future of this nation.  I don t need to talk about its technical tenets.  They are well understood and, if not,
a tour of the displays here will highlight the key ones to you.  This program has brought forward not just the best
technology, but it has brought a process.  An integrated product team of government and industry people working
hand-in-hand from the very beginning of the program made that a reality.  That has now become a model, not only for our
other programs and those of our sister services, but also for the way the Defense Department now functions in the entire
acquisition process.  The key is an integrated product team.  
 <P>
 Along the way, we got rid of most contract deliverables, and inspection standards are way down.  One hundred percent
of the processes that support the production of this aircraft and weapon system will be under the control of statistical
process control.  That is an important metric for us to track the quality of the product.  Great progress has been made in
this, and we are trying to capture this.  
 <P>
 We have already started flushing out the tooling with bits and pieces.  This August, you are going to see a main airframe
coming together.  Hopefully, we will have engine certification in December, and we are well on track.  At the end of May
next year, the first F-22 will be flying as part of EMD [Engineering and Manufacturing Development].
 <P>
 General Ralston also highlighted the importance of our upgrades to the B-1.  Clearly, it is the backbone of the bomber
force in the out-years, despite the B-52 going to be with us for a long time and the B-2 has a key element.  The B-1
upgrades for conventional weaponry and also defensive capabilities are important.  In this case we went to a single prime
contractor, rather than in the past functioning as an integrator as we did in the early days of the B-1 program.  It is a
multi-phased program, so it s evolutionary where we bring capability like CBU and cluster bombs up front.  We then bring
the JDAM like capability that the BVUD program brings to the table and gives us a 500-pound accurate weapon.  
 <P>
 Finally, we will add the last of the defensive measures to improve its survivability.  We learned our lesson from past
failures, and we have gone to industry to act as the integrator.  Industry does that a lot  better than we do, and as we get into
General Ashy s programs in the space world, you will see how we ve learned that lesson there also.  
 <P>
 The next program I ll talk to is the B-2.  I don t need to highlight its contribution to our warfighting capability.  It can
hold the highest valued targets at risk on the first day of the war.  That  why we bought it, and that s clearly what we expect
it to do.  As a result of working the process very hard, the last airplanes we have received have made it through very
vigorous LO [Low-observable] screening and they are ahead of schedule.  The first of our airplanes at Whiteman [AFB,
Mo.] is now back into the process to get reconfigured to the Block 30, which is the end game configuration, and will be
the full-up round as was mentioned earlier this morning.  
 <P>
 An example of what can be done in a very mature program is the work done by the program office and
Northrop-Grumman with the depot test systems and the support equipment at the depot to maintain this airplane.  They
eliminated all of the Milspecs and standards.  They took the deliverables from 29 down to 5 and along the way saved $60
million.  That is $60 million that we can use for modernization and recapitalization in other areas.  This was the same team,
as was mentioned earlier, that brought us the GATS-GAM, a GPS like capability with the ability to target multiple targets
at the same time by using radar and a GPS-aided weapon.  We brought the system to reality within two years.  The
considerable effort by that team has paid off in immediate warfighting capability.  
 <P>
 Probably the linchpin of all of the department, by this I mean the broader Department of Defense s acquisition
streamlining activities and its pilot program, is JDAM.  
 <P>
 During Operation Desert Storm, General Chuck Horner and the other senior warfighters identified a need to hold targets
at risk, even under poor weather conditions.  That drove us to a program that became the Joint Direct Attack Munition. 
It is an attempt to take our existing inventory of hard bombs and give them accuracy through GPS-IMU.  
 <P>
 We took one of our most aggressive program managers and put him on the program.  He originally estimated that if 
"I do this job right, it will cost about $40,000 a round."  Well, he and the industry team went into action.  It was a
competition between McDonnell Douglas and Martin Marietta which McDonnell Douglas won.  As a result of this new
approach, it s not a $40,000 weapon, but a weapon costing us $18,000 through delivery of the first rounds, and for the
long-term across the entire buy of 62,000 JDAMs for the Air Force, it will cost us $12,000 each.  
 <P>
 That was an entirely new mind set for those industrial players.  We wanted them to function as a team with members
of the program office and to be totally focused on taking cost out.  They obviously did an excellent job.  The end result is
$1.5 billion we can now program for other very high priority warfighting needs, and, by the way, they will get those
weapons considerably earlier than we had originally planned.  
 <P>
 Another program is the Wind Corrected Munition Dispenser.  If we want to operate at medium and high altitudes, we
need to be able to use our cluster bombs from that arena.  Of course, they are subject to the drift caused by wind and the
ballistic inaccuracies of the weapon.  By modifying those weapons with a pseudo-JDAM capability using an IMU, you can
cancel out the effects of the wind and provide that capability to operate off our bomber force.  When you think about a
bomber force that is capable of carrying large numbers of these SU-64 and SU-30 dispensers with anti-armor munitions
in them like the Senor Fused Weapon, you have a tremendous ability to affect an advancing ground army.  This is nother
program that is being run just like JDAM.  It is in a head-to-head fly-off between Lockheed Martin and Alliant.  That will
end in the 1997 when we go to a single contractor.  
  <P>
Stand-off weaponry is important.  It is especially important to our bomber force to give it viability in our non-stealthy
platforms on day one and to allow it to hold a larger percentage of the target set at risk.  JASSM [Joint Air-to-Surface
Standoff Missile] is the program that was put together after the failure of TSSAM [Tri-Service Standoff Attack Munition]. 
For those of you that don t remember TSSAM, it was an LO standoff weapon.  It had both hard target and also area
munition capability, but it became unaffordable.  We ended up with a weapon that was going to cost us in excess of $2
million a round.  It clearly could not fit into the paradigm that we created today.  
 <P>
 JASSM is focused on cost as one of the key performance parameters.  Cost will become a key performance characteristic
as we get a little farther down stream such that if we fail to meet that cost band,the program is at risk of cancellation just
as if it failed to meet survivability or range numbers.  This program has to work for the Air Force.  We need upwards of
2,400 of these weapons for our bomber force and some of our fighter force in the out years.  It is a very key program and
one that has joint applications because it also fills Navy needs.  
 <P>
 A program important to our future force structure in the Air Force is the Joint Strike Fighter, which is the product that
will come out of the JAST program, the Joint Advanced Strike Technology program.  This is as a pilot program to capture
all of the acquisition reform and streamlining initiatives   everything from using electronic source selection, from using
electronic medium such as Internet for exchanging information, from getting industry involved with every aspect of the
program, to where the developer, the requirer and industry sit down and write the requirements, write the statements of
objectives and also put together the various models that are used in underpinning the cost and effectiveness trades that will
be made.  
 <P>
 This program has done a good job at bringing that teamwork together.  It s a competitive program with three teams in
competition right now.  The schedule provides for selection in the late summer to start a concept demonstration phase in
the fall.  During that phase, we will have two contractors demonstrating ways to fill the Air Force s requirement, and also
that of our sister services and the Royal Navy.  So, it s already not only a joint program, but also a program with our allies. 
 <P>
 A good example of the way we are going to work in the future is the way the avionics are being treated in this program. 
Rather than the government putting an architecture on the street and defining the standards, we got a team together that
included not only industry, but also included industry associations.  We took inputs from them on what was critical in an
architecture for us to employ, and to what extent commercial hardware and software would become available.  We
published a draft and gave industry time to respond. 
 <P>
 The draft has been on the Internet for almost two years, and is getting responses.  We established decision milepoints
throughout the program when we would select the specific approaches to the bus structure and the types of processors, etc. 
We let industry and the industry associations tell us what was smart, and then government, in concert with the industry
associations, adjudicated this path.  That s thepartnership with industry which is the mainstay of our whole approach to
streamlining.
 <P>
 Joint STARS [Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar System] has been talked about this morning.  Indeed, the fact
we have just flown our 50th mission in support of the Bosnia operations and we are probably going to fly at least 50 more,
indicates the importance of this program to the theater warfighters.  Some interesting things have happened in the program
  a fairly mature program that has been around for quite awhile.  We put the mission planning system together where the
contractors had clear accountability for the design activity and for the performance.  As a result, they put together a plan
saving about $34 million just in the mission planning.  By the way, we ended up getting a product about 64 percent faster. 
<P>

  We found the right button to push, and they delivered a great product that is already supporting us in the theater.  I might
add, we will accept our first production airplane in mid-March and, interestingly, probably within two weeks of acceptance,
the airplane will be enroute to Bosnia.  Here is an airplane with two streamers on its squadron flag and it has yet to even
go operational.  That is rapid prototyping at its best.
 <P>
 In the area of space, clearly we are not lacking reform approaches.  I will highlight a couple of the programs that really
emphasize different things.  In the area of Milstar and communications, we reduced a lot of the deliverables.  We have a
single contract manager, Lockheed Martin in this case.  In taking the cost out of the program, we went from 19,000 plus
inspections in the process of receiving this satellite to now we have less than 100.  Yet the quality has remained high or
has improved in some cases.  By the way, we took $236 million out of the program cost.  That is $236 million for General
Ashy to use on other needs.  In doing that, we actually accelerated the schedule five months.
 <P>
 Our GPS program is important to the warfighter, to the civilian and commercial aerospace business and to a lot of other
industries.  In the case of GPS, for years we had multiple contracts that the  government integrated.  We went to a single
contract manager for the ground component of GPS   Loral Federal Systems.  They have total responsibility for the
performance of the product.  We immediately saved $80 million by getting the government out of the integration business. 
By the way, we were able to decrease thesize of our program office by almost 40 percent.  
 <P>
 On the space side, we ve gone to satellites that are high in commercial content using performance-based specs, and
we ve reduced the cycle time of building subsequent sustainment blocks of those satellites from eight years to five years. 
Those satellites should represent better technology which should improve their performance.
 <P>
 Finally, we have the Space Based Infrared System, a very important program to all warfighters.  It gives both the
strategic and tactical warfighting capabilities warning of missile launches and warning of other threat activities.  It replaces
our ongoing Defense Support Program [DSP] that provided us warnings of Scuds during Desert Storm.  SBIRS gives
increased precision so we can improve our targeting, and it is gives reduced cycle time to get that information into the
theater with direct downlinks.
 <P>
 To close on an afordable program, General Ashy and Vice Admiral Frost host a requirements review group of all the
various warfighters and other communities that make use of this product, and they very aggressively trade off cost and
performance.  A couple of weeks ago, it was interesting to see all of the service warfighters and the intelligence community
locked up in a tough battle trading cost and performance. 
<P>
  We ve had successes, but we have a long way to go in this area.  There is still more money to be saved and used for
more productive things.  I ve highlighted the issue that our warfighters are now very serious about trading off cost for
performance.  This is an ongoing part of every acquisition activity, not only at the front end, but throughout its life.  
  <P>
Some other initiatives have been called the Common Process Initiative.  If you happen to be a manufacturer such as
Raytheon, at their Andover facility, they had nine separate contracts across three services for various missile deliverables
  everything from AMRAAMs to Patriots.  They had nine separate sets of manufacturing processes and business practices
under contract.  That included nine soldering specs, nine quality specs, etc.  In their case and in a number of industry
partners who have already volunteered to come forward to be pilots, we have driven those multiple processes down to
single processes across that production facility and we are already seeing great benefits not only in quality but in taking
cost out.  
  <P>
Along those same lines, Lieutenant General Dick Scofield, who heads up our product center at Wright Patterson AFB
[Ohio], the Aeronautical Systems Center, is leading a group with his counterpart commanders in the Navy and the Marine
Corps and the Army to bring in the lean aircraft initiatives that MIT has developed for us.  That has become a very effective
tool for getting the aircraft industry as lean as the auto industry.   
 <P>
 You've heard mention of the Lighting Bolt Initiatives which we have implemented.  These are ways of trying to shock
the system, as the name implies.  They have been very effective.  We started out with eight of them.  The ninth is one that
you suggested to us.  It we need to get together and train together.  I am happy to say that this organization, the Air Force
Association, stood up, accepted that charge, and hosted a series of roundtables for us throughout the country and has
recently hosted three major training sessions.  AFA has also agreed to host additional sessions at your request.  These have
allowed us to get together with industry and train on how to apply streamlining in every aspect of the acquisition process. 
We are grateful to the AFA for taking on this initiative.  
<P>
  I'd like to change direction to embellish something addressed by several other speakers   "Where we are going in the
future."  As many of you know, Dr. Gene McCall is going to sit down with the AFA Science &Technology Committee
this afternoon.  He heads up our Scientific Advisory Board which has just finished a year-long effort to look at where the
Air Force needs to go in the 21st century in terms of what investments make sense and those that don t make sense.  The
effort ensures we have the right technologies for arming the Air Force into the 21st century.  For those of you who haven t
read it, I commend it to you.  It is accessible on the Worldwide Web.  You will see mention of sall distributed satellites,
uninhabited aircraft, use of lasers, and high powered microwaves and something called a photo fighter.  That is not a
RECCE platform.  
 <P>
 They have given us a very good roadmap of where we need to go in the future.  The Air Force is responding by
reorganizing our S&T program in line with that vision by identifying when and where wedivest of activities that are now
more readily available on the commercial market.  We also want to put the right amount of money into these technologies
that are so important to our future.  
 <P>
 I might add, this year, because of some plus up in the S&T accounts at the beginning of the year, the New World Vistas
Group is going to be given about $100 million across the FYDP [Future Years Defense Plan] to apply to the two or three
most leveraging technologies so we can ensure they really do happen.  Again, I commend the study to our industry partners
study because it is a direction we think we need to go. 
 <P>
 Let me quickly wrap up, and I ll be glad to answer any questions, except for the hard-target munition one.  First,
acquisition budgets are not going to grow in the near term.  Clearly, we have continuing needs that we must deal with. 
Streamlining can help us both in doing that and it can make industry s processes more effective.  That gets our warfighters
a lot more hardware for our investment dollars.  
 <P>
 To do so, takes a team effort.  It requires the development commands, industry and also the warfighter.  All three of us
must work together, which is clearly happening right now.  We need to institutionalize this teamwork.  As General Ralston
mentioned this morning, he and his staff representing the warfighter community and our staff at AQ, who represent the
development side, really work very closely on the budget drills and all of the necessary changes to keep an executable
program that hopefully meets the warfighter s highest priorities.  
 <P>
 I'd like to sum up with one comment.  While we see some tough times ahead from the standpoint of decisions to be
made, through teamwork and partnership in these programs as we ve done in our current activities with the field users, and
by using discipline when we come to the table with our requirements and our ways of meeting them, we can hold our own. 
We can provide that 21st Century air warrior the tools needed to meet the Chief s challenge of pursuing an asymmetric
strategy to win quickly, decisively and with minimum collateral damage and casualties.  
 <P>
 With that, I d like to say we are indeed in an electronic age.  If any of you have interest in pursuing any more of this
information or any of you want to get access to the New World Vistas Study, don t hesitate to use the Internet and pursue
that strategy. 
  <P>
 With that, I d be more than happy to take any questions you might have.

<P>
  <I>GEN. SHAUD:</I>  Have you found any important centers of opposition to the Lightning Bolt Initiatives and other recent
acquisition reforms and what are you doing to overcome them?
 <P><I>LT. GEN. MUELLNER:</I>
Unfortunately, the answer is yes; there is indeed opposition to the initiatives.  I first thought more
of the opposition would come from industry.  That is not the case.  Most of the opposition comes from the inertia of our
own internal process.  We have found a great deal of reticence by various elements in the acquisition community to
embrace these streamlining measures and to stop doing business as they ve done for 20 years.  These are things they ve
done in some cases because of previous problems or because the process evolved that way.  What we are doing to fix that
is captured in the training sessions we are having with industry.  Those sessions have already had positive outgrowth. 
Those training sessions continue at our product and logistics centers.  We also have acquisition streamlining offices at each
center. 
<P>
  We also have a team that goes out and helps each of our program managers scrub the RFP on the front end to ensure
it incorporates all of those streamlined elements we have tried to put in place.  We have had resistance.  It has not come
from the areas where I thought it would, but we have successfully overcome it or are at least are working to overcome it.
 <P>
  <I>GEN. SHAUD:</I>  Acquisition reform focuses heavily on the integration of civilian and military economies, yet the recent
New World Vistas Study showcased many technologies that have precious little value to the civilian economy.  Is there a
potential disconnect here or is that just the way it goes?
  <P><I>LT. GEN. MUELLNER:</I>
No.  We probably need to read a little deeper into the New World Vistas Study because it did two
things:  It highlighted some technology areas that clearly are not going to be out there on the shelves in the Wal-Mart of
the future, and it also highlighted technologies that will exist in the commercial world, and we ought to quit divesting in
them.  It did a good job in both of areas and showed us where there are seams between the two.  From what we have seen,
even in avionics which are "commercially available," there are things like sensors where the commercial market place for
those technologies is still not as great as the military market place and the military need.  Clearly, in the area of processing
and communications, for instance,  we need to rely on the commercial sector.  The New World Vistas Study gave us a
charter to go in that direction.
  Gen. Shaud:  Here is a very specific question with regard to the JAST program.  There has been some debate on a gun
for JAST.  Would you describe the debate and discuss the rationale?
 <P><I>LT. GEN. MUELLNER:</I>
I d prefer to defer that question to the next speaker.
  <P>
  <I>GEN. SHAUD:</I>  Has the Air Force determined how it will use the $493 million Congressional add on to the B-2 program?
  <P><I>LT. GEN. MUELLNER:</I>
 We are in the process of finalizing decisions right now.  The decision was made recently on how
we would pursue allocating the money which was added to the B-2 program.  The focus, as hightlighted by General Ralston
earlier, is on robusting its conventional warfighting capability and ensuring we have a viable platform to hold those targets
at risk from day one and giving us the ability to project power and stay for a period of time, based on availability of spares,
et cetera.  Sometime in the next few weeks, we will have finalized the requirement by specific components and specific
programs.  
 <P>
  <I>GEN. SHAUD:</I>  Do you forsee any increase in the arena of international cooperation for the development and
acquuisition of systems?
  <P><I>LT. GEN. MUELLNER:</I>There is a tremendous push to increase cooperation, but as weare finding out in a number of our
ongoing programs, it must be incorporated into the early stages of a program to be effective and be a program which we
and our allies can execute.  In the case of JAST, we put in place a framework to do  allow us and the Royal Navy to satisfy
our needs and work to a common solution.  
  We see other programs with existing products on the table where it is much more difficult to harmonize those activities
  for example the competion between the AIM-9X and ASRAAM [Advanced Short Range Air-to-Air Missile] and
between JASSM and CASOM.  I believe the UK Ministry of Defense is just as concerned as we are about bad decision
getting programs off track.  We can better leverage our R&D dollars through international cooperation, but it must be done
right and it must be done early in the program.  
 <P>
  <I>GEN. SHAUD:</I>  Sir, thank you for being with us.  I can see the personnel system matched the right person for the job.

<P>
  It is great to be back in Montana and to be part of this forum and participate with General Parker and the 20th Air
Force.  Today I'm here to talk about arms control and what is going on in that area.   Arms control today is both a story
of continuity and change.  Continuity involves the process of implementing the Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces
Treaty, the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, and the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.  We use the INF treaty
experience as a template for the on-site inspection regimes that these other two treaties have employed successfully. 
It s a common element.  The On-Site Inspection Agency, however, does not do verification judgements.  That is
reserved for the highest level of our government and something that the government of the United States takes very
seriously.  We contribute to that process.   
 <P>
  President Bush stated our commitment to verification of our treaties when he said in 1990, "Without exception, the
United States expects meticulous fulfillment of all existing and future arms control agreements and all obligations that
they entail.  We cannot and will not accept any lesser standard.  Put simply, arms control commitments must be
precisely defined and scrupulously observed.  Nothing less will do." 
 <P>
  The START Treaty, entered into force about a year ago in December 1994.  United States along with four nations of
the former Soviet Union   Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Kazhikstan   accomplished much during this first treaty
year.  The START baseline period was a 120-day period involving more than 113 inspections.  The United States,
using OSIA, accomplished 76 of these inspections in those four countries, while Russia and the Ukraine accomplished
37 inspections on United States facilities.  The very first was here at Malmstrom on March 5 this year.  Six weeks ago I
had the opportunity to travel on my first START-related inspection.  Let me tell you a bit about that. 
 <P>
  On our arms control inspections for START, we enter at only two places in Russia: an east entry point at Ulan- Ude,
near Lake Baykal, well inside of Siberia, and it is 3,500 kilometers from Japan.  On the western side, we enter at
Moscow.  On my first trip, I went to Ribatchi, which is a submarine base on the Kamchatka Peninsula.  We start from
Japan and traveled to Ulan-Ude by C-141.  The next morning we told the Russianswhere we are going to inspect, and
they had nine hours to get us there.   
 <P>
  The U.S. inspection team is 10-man team and is led by a Lieutenant Colonel mission commander.  I performed duty as
a team member.  Lt. Col. Craig Hansen was our team chief.  At the Russian military airfield, we got on a Russian
Aeroflot AN-24.  Even though they had nine hours to get us there, it took 17 hours.  That was well-through the day and
a violation of the treaty.  The mission commander has the option of continuing the inspection or not.   He chose to
continue the inspection so we went on with it.   
 <P>
  We arrived at Ribachi on the Kamchatka Peninsula, a beautiful place, just before sunup and immediately went into the
inspection.  It was an RV [reentry vehicle] on-site inspection.  The purpose is to verify the warheads on a particular
missile to make sure there are no more reentry vehicles than allowed.  That was the type of inspection we were doing. 
Once we determined a missile to inspect, a particular tube in that submarine, our inspectors stay with that missile until
we see what is on the front end.  We began that process, identified the missile tube on a sleek, black, Delta-3
submarine, and then followed that missile as it went from its alert moorings, and very slowly transited to a loading
dock where a very professional group of young Russian maintainers, conscripts and officers, unloaded the missile.  It
was a liquid-fueled SSN-18.  They pulled it out using a crane and put it on a truck to haul it to a maintenance bunker
where they take the front end off and prepare it for our inspectors.   
 <P>
  That process took a good portion of the day.  By the evening, we verified what was supposed to be there.  The
inspection went pretty flawlessly.  Then we did the inspection report and finished all this about 11:30 at night.  At that
point, we were operating 42 hours straight without sleep.  For you young guys, that may be no problem, but I was
dragging a bit. 
 <P>
  These are tough conditions, but the people are very professional in every way.  During our return flight, we flew back
to Ulan-Ude on an the AN-24, a two-engine prop plane.  I found an interesting experience on the way back.  We
stopped at a bomber base called Ukanka as the Russians have trouble buying fuel at commercial facilities, so they must
stop at military bases.  The government s credit card for fuel doesn t work at the commercial airports so they have to
stop at the military bases.  Ukanka is a bomber base so they kept it dark, and we had to get out of the airplane.  As my
eyes adjusted, I could see all the ominous Bear-D bombers parked all around.  Here I was a former Cold War warrior
standing in the middle of all these bombers.  I contemplated what it meant to stand there among those weapons of war
that are now limited by international treaty and subject to my inspection, but nevertheless still are awesome symbols of
power and potential destruction.  The need for continuing deterrence also hit me hard. 
 <P>
  We completed this trip in 110 hours with only about 16 hours of sleep during that time.  Team Hansen, we called the
teams by the name of the team chief, returned to Japan.  I returned to the United States, but the teamcontinued on
another inspection just three days later.  They went back into Ulan-Ude and on to an ICBM silo base to complete
another inspection.   
 <P>
  The 120-day baseline inspection period is now complete.  During this period, the United States inspected all of the
possible sites in Russia, the declared facilities except the one base at Mosdock, a strategic bomber base that is down in
southern Russia near Chechnya.  The problem there was the Russians didn t want to let us there for our own safety. 
They moved their bombers out of there.  But we have the right and we will go back and inspect that base when the
situation allows for it.   
 <P>
  Our inspectors did have some questions during this inspection period.  During the START treaty baseline, these
inspections may involve ambiguities or questions of access to thing we were supposed to under the treaty.  If our team
chiefs aren t satisfied with an issues, these things have to be resolved at the political level by the Joint Compliance
Inspection Commission that meets in Geneva.   
 <P>
  The other side of the coin has occurred, too.  Inspections have occurred here in the United States.  OSIA had a big part
in preparing for these inspections under the leadership of General Parker.  He started that.  There were five rounds of
START mock inspections to prepare our people.  You have done an outstanding job in presenting your weapons
systems for Russian inspection.   
 <P>
  Let me move to another front, the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty.  The CFE treaty has now concluded its
three years of reductions.  The treaty states must be in compliances with the treaty-prescribed levels by the 17th of
November 1995.  Not all are in compliance, but nevertheless a tremendous amount has been accomplished with the
CFE treaty.  Some 47,000 pieces of conventional armament have been eliminated through this treaty.  That translates
to 18,000 tanks, 8,900 artillery pieces, 17,500 armored combat vehicles, 280 aircraft and 2,100 attack helicopters. 
Beginning in three days, there will be a period of increased CFE operational activity.  That will be the residual level
validation or a second-baseline period.   
 <P>
  During this period, we will inspect 20 percent of the declared objects of verification.  This will give us a way of
confirming that the CFE treaty reductions have indeed been met.  During the CFE Treaty baseline reduction phase, the
treaty nations, the allies and the Warsaw Pact countries, did a great deal of cooperation.  However, then the
environment totally changed on us.  The treaty is still based on a "block-to-block" scenario, but the alliances and
allegiances of the nations shifted during that period of time.  It was a great period of growth and working together.   
 <P>
  Let s review just for a moment how grueling and challenging the inspections can be.  I discovered that on my
inspection to the submarine base.  As a model, the INF Treaty set precedents and standards that provided for
significant continuity in implementing today s newer treaties.  As we have seen, in the changing world with lots of
surprises and uncertainties, people on the scene can make a difference in building trust and confidence.  Let me tell you
a little bit about the On-Site Inspection Agency and the people that make up the On-Site Inspection Agency.   
 <P>
  President Reagan established the On-Site Inspection Agency in January 1988 to carry out the INF Treaty inspection,
and to escort and monitor as well.  Since then, the scope has broadened and inspection activities for the United States
include new treaties, treaties that we are preparing for and other treaty-like agreements.  The growth in OSIA has been
due to these new treaties.  Currently in force are the INF Treaty, the START Treaty, and the CFE Treaty.  Other U.S.
obligations awaiting implementation include the Open Skies Treaty   Malmstrom is a refueling base for the Open
Skies Treaty, so there will be a day in the near term where you will have aircraft from other nations landing here. 
Other obligations include the bilateral and multilateral chemical weapons agreements and potentially the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which is being negotiated now, as well as security and cooperation measures in
Europe.  OSA has added a new mission in the cooperative threat reduction program.  We are involved with DNA
[Defense Nuclear Agency] in cooperation with this.  We do audits and examinations that are similar to inspections, but
have a lot less structured mandate. 
 <P>
  Currently, there are about 800 people at OSIA, two-thirds are military, and one-third are civilian.  They are truly a
national resource.  OSIA has over 10 percent of the U.S. military s Russian linguists, about 15 percent of all U.S.
Army foreign area officers that specialize in Russia and about 10 percent of the Army s field grade officers that have
chemical weapons expertise.  My predecessor was fond of saying that OSIA was a schoolhouse for the future of the
military.  When our military officers return to their respective services, their duty with OSIA gives them a good deal of
experience with application in a joint environment.  They will have worked with international agencies, such as NATO
and United Nations, and worked with officers of many different services.  This will certainly be valuable as we move
into the 21st Century and our officers must have the background to handle a variety of tasks. 
 <P>
  Who are these men and women who implement these on-site inspections?  What is their character?  Each inspection
team and escort mission is led by a mission commander, a guy like Lt. Col. Hansen that led the mission I was on. 
These folks are field grade officers with about 15 years of service, and all of them have one or more advanced degrees. 
Some of them have Russian language proficiency and most have command experience.   
 <P>
  They are held accountable for establishing and maintaining a professional, business-like tone with their treaty
counterparts as they go about, either inspecting or escorting.  They are also responsible for team discipline and
professionalism and, to a degree, team training.   
 <P>
  They must know the entire process of the inspection business, including the treaties, inside and out.  These treaties are
complex with multiple documents and protocols to them.  There are general guidelines in the treaties, but a lot of the
decision is left to the on-site mission commander.  They are the United States government s representative during the
inspection period, bearing all the responsibilities and exercising the authority delegated by the President.   
 <P>
  There are others on the team such as our linguists, enlisted men and women from each of our armed services.  OSIA
has 10 percent of all U.S. military Russian linguists   a wealth of language skill and experience.  Routinely, two
mid-level sergeants and petty officers, each with a significant amount of language capability, are assigned to an
inspection team along with another two enlisted folks who are weapons system experts.  These people must also be
experts on the treaties, which are a maze of legal and technical terminology in any language.  For example, the START
Treaty has 685 pages and 12 protocol.  Our linguists not only  have to know these treaties in English, they have to
know them in Russian as well, a tough job. 
<P> 
  The on-site inspection process is not always one that is carried out under ideal conditions.  Mother Nature and the
forces of time and tension and geography put pressure on the team, especially the linguists who must translate technical
terms and keep emotions out of the process.  They must accurately translate all those legal and technical information
and make sure that the treaty rights are protected.  This is tough.   
<P> 
  Our people are not daylight and fair weather inspectors.  They regularly are about their mission under very rugged
conditions.  I want to add also that this is not a characteristic just of the U.S. inspectors, the Russians and our treaty
partners in other treaties have held themselves to this same standard. 
 <P>
  Let me talk about some of the emerging missions in OSIA.  The chemical weapons control regime is another area
where the traditional nation-to-nation arms control provisions my not apply.  Under the Chemical Weapons
Convention, an international inspection directorate, not national verification agencies, will conduct on-site inspections. 
A similar regime is anticipated for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which is being negotiated in Geneva and the
President has a goal to sign that treaty by April.  The Chemical Weapons and Open Skies Treaty are awaiting
verification before they can enter into force.  More precisely, the Chemical Weapons Treaty needs 65 countries to
ratify it out of 130 nations that have signed the treaty.  The United States has not yet ratified that treaty.  The Open
Skies Treaty needs three more countries to ratify it   Belarus, Ukraine and Russia   before these treaties can enter
into force.   
 <P>
  Another new area where the United States and OSIA is involved is in the Defense Department s CTR program.  The
changing political, social and economic conditions in countries that make up former Soviet Union have made it
difficult for them to provide safe and secure storage and transportation and dismantling of these nuclear weapons.  The
CTR program exists to reduce the weapons of mass destruction in these countries, warhead by warhead, missile by
missile and factory by factory.  OSIA teams perform audits and examinations [A&E] and inspections under the CTR
program to ensure that the Nunn-Lugar initiative money is being spent appropriately.  Secretary of Defense Perry has
called this program "defense by other means." 
 <P>
  What skills are necessary to carry out this new mission?  Professionalism and good judgement.  Let me introduce you
to another one of the mission commanders who does this A&E work.  That is Commander Paul Petersen.  Paul is
assigned to OSIA s CTR office and is a fully qualified treaty inspector mission commander as well.  He regularly and
routinely conducts these CTR audits and examinations.  When I asked him to describe what new lessons he has learned
in this program, Commander Petersen explained there were no new lessons, rather he restated the lessons learned by so
many of his predecessors and his colleagues in other aspects of the inspection business: He said, "One, know the
mission; two, know your team; three, maintain OSIA standards, that is, uncompromising integrity, teamwork and
professionalism."  Commander Petersen routinely calls upon our motto in OSIA, Trust and Verify, with the emphasis
on the trust, to trust his instincts, trust his training, trust his experiences, trust his teammates and trust his counterparts
as he carries out this mission.   
 <P>
  This attitude is not unusual from an officer who has sharpened his teeth in strategic weapons inspection, an 
uncompromising treaty that has giving us experience leading to this audit and examination activity under a bilateral
relationship with the Russians.  The men and women of the On-Site Inspection Agency have taken the difficult and
forged it into the routine, taken the unknown and made it understandable, all the while maintaining a professionalism
that I am extremely proud of.  The On-Site Inspection Agency has proven its value to the implementation of arms
control treaties and agreements, and the On-Site Inspection Agency and its counterpart  national verification
organizations face a busy and bright future.   
 <P>
  Former adversaries have achieved a level of confidence unexpected just a decade ago.  Collectively, we have increased
the levels of transparency and security for all of our treaty partners.  The On-Site Inspection Agency has been
meticulous in its implementation of existing and future arms control agreements.  The changes taking place demand
the same professionalism and attitude and attention to detail that we have always applied to our mission.  That is the
same kind of attitude and professionalism and dedication to detail that missileers have applied to their mission.  In that
sense, an arms control inspector and missileer share a common standard and a common task to make the United States
a far more secure and safe plce to live.  I feel that as a missileer and as a person in the arms control inspection business,
nothing less than that standard will do. 
 <P>
  Thanks, it has been good to be with you this morning.  It would be my pleasure to field your questions at this time. 
 <P>
  <I>QUESTION:</I>  You mentioned earlier about the INF Treaty that started last December and CFE that is about to be
completed.  How long will you be involved in this process of conducting these compliance inspections for the Open
Skies Treat. 
 <P>
  <I>BRIG. GEN. KUENNING:</I>  First, it must enter into force.  Is it indefinite?  My predecessor tells me it is indefinite.  
 <P>
  <I>QUESTION:</I>  Do you have a time frame we would expect the treaty to be ratified and be implemented? 
 <P>
  <I>BRIG. GEN. KUENNING:</I> The Russians have some concerns that they have to bear more responsibility in hosting
inspections.  It seems like everybody wants to fly over Russia and nobody wants to fly over the United States.  It is a
treaty where the data gained on these flights is shared.  There are four means of collection on the aircraft.  There are
only four or five missions currently reserved for flights over the United States because the allies have agreed not to fly
over each other and a lot of the former Warsaw Pact countries can t afford to fly over the United States.  So, the
Russians are feeling a bit put upon that everybody wants to be flying over them and they are not going to get any data
out of the United States.  So it will be some time before it enters into force.   
 <P>
  We are in the process of preparing the aircraft and working with allies and working with former adversaries to figure
out how to go about this.  But I don t expect that first aircraft to land here at Malmstrom except perhaps as a training
mission for a number of years.   
 <P>
  <I>QUESTION:</I>  Can you describe their warhead accounting system, how do they keep track of what they have produced,
what they have destroyed and what is available? Are you fairly confident that we and they have a fairly good grip on
where their warheads are? 
<P> 
 <I>BRIG. GEN. KUENNING:</I>  The actual warhead accounting is more a function in the START II Treaty and also an activity
that those who are involved in the threat reduction business keep track of.  We primarily ensure the missiles declared to
be deployed don t have more warheads on than are supposed to be on them.  We don t track those warheads in the
On-Site Inspection Agency other than when they are deployed on operational birds.  We don t have access to their
warhead storage areas in an open way although that is part of the CTR program.  The level of confidence builds greater
and greater day by day.  Our audits and examinations make sure that things that are supposed to be used to take these
things apart and protect these warheads are actually being used to do that.  When we do that and see that happening,
then our confidence grows that those warheads are being secured and are being reduced in the proper way in Russia.  
<P> 
  We have a little bit more confidence in some of the non-Russian parts of the former Soviet Union, where for instance,
we participated in the removal of some of the nuclear materials back into the United States.  OSIA people did that
mission.  I don t have a really solid answer for you, but the process, and being close to what they are doing can help us,
and it much better than staying at arms length. 
<P> 
  <I>QUESTION:</I>   What is the goal of the Russian missile force once they reach their reductions? 
 <P>
  <I>BRIG. GEN. KUENNING:</I>  I don t think this is totally clear yet because the Russians continue to produce new missiles. 
Where we have a portal monitoring facility at Bot Kinsk, which is about 600 miles east of Moscow, we have that
facility that initially existed because that is where they made the SS-20, but it also has a reason to exist in START now. 
What we do is make sure no SS-20s are coming out of the plant, but we lso count and track the SS-25s that come out
of that plant.  The Russians continue to produce SS-25s and continue to modernize their force.  They have a new
missile which is a variant of the SS-25.  We are calling it the SSX-27.  They still seem to find  resources to modernize
their forces.  The Russians draw a lot of their legitimacy as a super power from those nuclear forces and the generals
are not letting people forget that.  They are still applying resources to their strategic missile force.   
 <P>
  There is an important mission for the missileer to do yet and we must maintain our vigilance while we pursue arms
control.  We should look at it as a two-pronged spear that helps protect us.  At one end, are people engaged in the arms
control process and doing that very professionally.  At other pointy end are strategic forces which must maintain that
professionalism.  When those Russian inspectors, a lot of them are strategic rocket forces people, come here and see
the professionalism that you show to them here at Malmstrom and at our other missile bases, it adds to the deterrent
equation out there.  Don t ever lose sight of that. 
<P> 
 <I>QUESTION:</I>  When you say they are modernizing their missiles, what aspect of their missiles are they modernizing? 
 <P>
  <I>BRIG. GEN. KUENNING:</I>  There are some performance aspects to their modernization efforts.  They are not like us.  They
are not making their missile stages more environmentally friendly.  But they are doing basic improvements to them  
improving the solid fuel characteristics and propulsion as well as the guidance.  There are subtle changes to these
things because there are limits as to the numbers and there can be no new types, but they can have modernizations. 
That is what they are doing.  They are staying within the treaty limits on what defines new types of missiles.  They are
dedicated to keeping the strategic rocket forces a professional and capable force with what is left after START II.  It
will be a force without MIRV d ICBMs.  There is a lot of opposition in the military about that right now.  We ll see
how that works out because as you know START II has not been ratified in either Russia or the United States.

General Ronald R. Fogleman<BR>
Chief of Staff, USAF<BR>
Los Angeles AFA Symposium<BR>
October 27, 1995<BR>

                          <center><B>The Future is Ours -- Today</B></Center>
<P>
  It's great to be back in Los Angeles!  This is the first place I appeared in public after becoming the Chief of Staff
last year, and at that time I laid out some themes for the United States Air Force.  I talked about building a team within a
team.  I talked about leadership and quality of life issues, and one of the biggest things the force needed in my mind   a
period of stability from both external and internal change.  
<P>
  This past September in Washington, D.C., I gave a "report to the stockholders;" my perspective on what we had or
had not done so far to meet those objectives.  And so with the danger of perhaps setting a precedent here, what I would like
to do now is share with you where I see the Air Force going over the next 12 months   a period of time, I personally
believe that presents the Air Force and the Nation a rare opportunity to look toward the future.  
<P>
  I'll warn you up front, much of what I'll say is not new; but sometimes seemingly mundane events and information
can take on new meaning when viewed from a fresh perspective.  I believe the unusual circumstances of the coming year
present such a case.  In my view, this is an unusual time in our history because it has the potential to provide us a period
of relative stability, so we can focus on the future.
<P>
  On the international front, we face no significant direct threats to our national security.  On the national level, we
have largely completed our post-Cold War demobilization.  The American people and the Congress have generally been
supportive of the current defense budget levels; that is, we have seen a very strong message that perhaps we have drawn
down too far, too fast.  So, for at least the foreseeable future, it appears as though we will see a pause in the budget decline. 
<P>
  On the Department of Defense level, the uncertainties of the Base Realignment and Closure Commission are behind
us.  We now know which bases are affected, and I don't anticipate we ll see any BRAC activity until at least the 21st
Century.  The Commission on Roles and Missions report was presented in June, and is now behind us.  I think Deputy
Secretary of Defense John White, who was then Chairman of the Commission, did a superb job.  Rather than try to dictate
to the Services who should do what, when, where and how; he focused on the process that the department needs to use to
determine which capabilities each service should provide to meet the needs of the joint warfighters.  And so with the report
in hand, the turbulence caused by the uncertainty of the roles and missions outcome is also gone.  
<P>
  For all intents and purposes, our personnel drawdown is behind us.  Under the Bottom-Up Review we were given
an end strength of 385,000; we finished the fiscal year with an end strength of 400,000.  So, that means over the next two
years we have to take another 15,000 people out of the Air Force, but the personnel system can do that through normal
recruiting, retention, and release programs.  You re not going to see big programs like VSI, SSB, or RIFs over the next few
years.  So, there is a good news story in this area.  
<P>
  If there is a bad news story in the personnel area, it may be in the civilian personnel side of the house.  We have gone
from 266,000 down to 195,000 civilians.  In the course of doing that, we have probably taken all the low hanging fruit and
now we are down to a very difficult situation where we have to take another 30,000 people out of the force over the next
couple of years.  So, the civilian drawdown of our total force will take on increasing importance for our senior leadership
during the coming year.
<P>
  Given that this is the situation on the international, national, and DoD level, we still have potent forces for change
on the horizon we must begin to consider.  Again in the international arena, there are continuing changes in the political,
economic, and military environment.  We find growing  instability and uncertainty in a world racked by differences over
religion, politics, ethnic groups, territory, and a myriad of diverse regional issues.
<P>
  On the national level, we face a presidential election year in 1996, with all the attendant politics and the impact that
will have, particularly on the defense industry.  Pressure to reduce the budget deficit through additional defense cuts may
emerge towards the end of this discussion.  As the American people begin to feel the cuts that are being made in the
non-defense portions of the budget, we may experience shifts away from the widespread, strong support for defense that
we enjoy in Congress today.
<P>
  We also see new demands placed on the U.S. military as the American public confronts the challenges of the new
world order; we face the very real possibility of deploying ground forces to Bosnia in the not toodistant future.  And the
opportunities brought to us through advances in technology, especially in the area of information, computing, and
space-based operations are out there for us   we can seize the initiative or allow it to fly past us.
<P>
  I like to follow Casey Stengel's advice and not make predictions   particularly about the future; however, I feel
certain the circumstances I just described will have a significant influence on the Air Force of the 21st Century.  For this
reason, I offer the following themes to serve as our priorities for the coming year:
<P>
  First, explore the future   identify alternatives and opportunities for national defense, and the role to be played by
tomorrow's Air Force.
<P>
  Second, plan for the future   institutionalize long range planning in the Air Force to capitalize on the opportunities
and prepare for the challenges of the future.
<P>
  The third point follows naturally, we must prepare for the future   establish strong foundations to ensure our
people and infrastructure can support the changes we expect in tomorrow s Air Force, and the Air Force after that.
 <P>
 Fourth, I think we must tell the Air Force story   as we look to the future, we must ensure the Nation understands
the capabilities and the limitations of air and space power.
 <P>
 And finally, we must continue to give the force some stability   for without stability, it will be very difficult to work
on the other priorities.  We will be captured by near-term priorities, by individual concerns and issues.  So, we must
redouble our efforts to give the institution and our people stability.  
<P>
  The themes I expressed last year are still valid   perhaps even more so   for each theme underpins some aspect
of our priorities for the coming year.  I firmly believe continued emphasis on these themes is critical to our institutional
stability during this period.
<P>
  First, we will maintain a stable environment   within our span of control   so our people, and the Nation, know
where the Air Force is headed.  Before we embark on the next segment of our journey, we intend to take some bearings
to ensure we accurately know our current position, so that we can maintain a steady course and avoid unnecessary
turbulence.
 <P>
 We will maintain our force structure and organization on a constant path so that we can assess where to apply course
corrections in the future.  This doesn t mean the Air Force will stagnate   as problems and issues are identified, we will
face them head on.  We will continue to improve our capabilities, concepts, and business practices.  But, we will avoid
change for the sake of change because near-term turbulence associated with such change will impair our ability to take a
long view toward the future.
<P>
  We will continue to work as one Air Force team, on the larger joint team.  We must be inclusive, not exclusive, and
we must become familiar with all the components on our warfighting team   the Air Force total force team.  We depend
on every member of the total Air Force team   civilians, guardsmen, reservists, retirees, industry, families   everyone
who, like you, supports air and space power for our national security.  We have a great team.  I m proud of every member,
but there are still openings available   I hope you can help us "recruit" new members in your community for the total
force, Air Force team.
<P>
  We will also continue to fight to improve quality of life for our people.  It s our people who make the Air Force
great, and we must shepherd this most important resource for the good of the country!  OPTEMPO will continue to be a
concern, so we will continue to pursue innovative ways to meet our 120-day maximum TDY goal across the force.  We
have made great progress in this area during the past year.   In 1994, we had 13 out of 20 mission areas exceed our goal. 
In 1995, only 8 out of 20 exceeded that goal.  This did not happen by accident.  It happened because of hard work on the
part of Air Force commanders.  OPTEMPO will remain a big issue, but at the same time it s clear that our people
understand that this is the nature of our business, and they will always respond when our nation calls.
<P>
  Every team needs a great leader and we are blessed with a Secretary of Defense who understands and supports the
members of the armed services.  Dr. Perry is leading the charge for compensation and benefits, housing, and services to
meet the needs of our people.  For our part, within the Air Force, the senior leadership must ensure what our people do is
important; that they receive appropriate recognition; and wemust take care of them and their families while they are
deployed. 
 <P>
 Leadership holds the key to our future.  We will continue to foster leaders who are prepared to function as joint
warfighters, and who cultivate an environment of trust and teamwork throughout our Air Force.  We recently held an Air
Force Quality Council meeting at Maxwell Air Force Base where the senior leadership decided that it is time on our quality
journey to refocus the program from one of discussion and education to greater emphasis on application.  We will work
aggressively toward our concept of a quality Air Force   one where each and every one of our people in the Air Force is
provided an environment where they are able to achieve their full potential.
"Leadership holds the key to our future.  We will continue to foster leaders who are prepared to function as joint
warfighters, and who cultivate an environment of trust and teamwork throughout our Air Force." 
<P>
  And finally, we must hold the course on today s modernization plan, because this modernization plan is the
foundation for tomorrow s Air Force, and the Air Force after next.  We will continue to look to the Air Force s vision of
Global Reach Global Power to guide our decisions.  Our current modernization plan provides a stable, balanced,
time-phased approach to meet the needs of the nation as we enter the 21st century.  It is affordable.  It will meet the joint
warfighter s needs as long as it stays time-phased, and focused on all aspects of airpower to include strategic mobility,
bomber upgrades, fighter modernization, and space systems.  We need stability across these programs to give us a solid
starting point to launch into the future.  Those on the Air Force team can help this effort by understanding and articulating
these programs at the local, national, and international level.
 <P>
 As I travel around the world and meet the air chiefs from other countries and as they come to visit us it is very clear
that the United States Air Force is the world s most respected air and space force, today.  But, I know there is more that
we can do to contribute to national defense in the post-Cold War era.  I believe our Air Force provides a unique economy
of force capability to the joint force commander   a capability not yet fully understood, appreciated, or exploited.
<P>
  I like to think that airmen are fast learners, but, I recently ran across an essay on airpower written in 1949 by the
noted British airman and thinker Air Chief Marshall Sir John Slessor; one of the real architects of airpower in the second
world war.  He wrote, "Our actual practical experience of air power is infinitesimal compared to our knowledge of sea and
land warfare . . . we have been fighting at sea and on land for thousands of years."  I believe there is plenty of fertile ground
to grow and develop airpower.  So, during the next year, we will have people hard at work identifying alternatives and
exploring opportunities as we enter the 21st century, and turn over our first hundred years of experience in the air.
<P>
  Thirty years ago, one of my predecessors, General McConnell, wrote about the future based on what he d seen in
the past.  His writings give me confidence today that exploring alternatives and opportunities is not only possible, but a
potentially rewarding exercise.  
<P>
  He observed first that "political developments may continue to bring about radical changes in the international power
balance and the alignment of nations.  Today s bitter enemy may be tomorrow s close ally, and vice versa."  I think he did
a superb job, back in 1966, of forecasting the fll of the Soviet Union almost 30 years later.
 <P>
 Second, "military developments   for example, nuclear proliferation and hostile aggression in space   may pose
problems in the future." General McConnell s future is today!
<P>
  Third, "technological developments can have a revolutionary impact on the means and techniques of warfare."  I
believe he would recognize stealth, precision weapons, microchips, and directed energy in this category.
 <P>
 Finally, General McConnell reminded us that "catastrophic events such as earthquakes and other disasters" can have
far-reaching consequences.  Could he have possibly imagined the unprecedented environmental concerns we face today
as we develop our warfighting strategies?  Or perhaps he was thinking of a Mount Pinatubo and its impact on our strategic
basing posture in the Pacific.
<P>
  It was this kind of forward thinking, agility and willingness to embrace new ideas, constructs, and technology that
sowed the seeds for our overwhelming victory in Desert Storm.  Today, we have a varietyof ongoing initiatives to continue
the quest for capabilities required in the 21st century.
 <P>
 We have a study that s being conducted at Air University called Air Force 2025.  Study participants are considering
alternative futures, identifying possible "historical discontinuities," and exploring changes to our organizations and
doctrine.  My charge to this group is to conduct "maverick" out-of-the-box thinking.
<P>
  In December of this year the Scientific Advisory Board will give us its New World Vistas report.  Secretary Widnall
and I chartered this group to give us a truly independent, futuristic view of how the exponential rate of technological change
will shape the 21st Century Air Force.
 <P>
 We plan to conduct a revitalized Air and Space Symposium this year at Maxwell Air Force Base; but under a
different name.  I want to see us build   for the first time   a credible, Air University-led, joint wargame that looks at
the changing nature of warfare in the 21st century.  I d also like to see participation from the CINCs, Congressional staff,
journalists, and academia.
<P>
  And there s more, of course, because we re going to go back and take advantage of last year s SPACECAST 2020
study and various special study efforts sponsored by the Air Staff, major commands, and Air Force agencies to round out
our look to the future.  In this effort, we are throwing as large a net as we possibly can.  For example, Air University has
established a Worldwide Web site on the Internet to capture ideas for 2025 from around the globe.  It has also invited
speakers from all walks of life to challenge the traditional perspectives of our 2025 study participants.
<P>
  We know we cannot assume a future that looks like today; in fact, we can almost guarantee it will be different,
possibly radically different.  So, we must avoid attempts to package airpower into neat, little stovepipes based on
yesterday s thinking   strategic air, tactical air, mobility, special operations, space   all these attempts to put airpower
into a box limit the inherent flexibility of airpower to operate across an entire theater, or across the globe.  We ve made
this mistake before, and I m determined we won t repeat it again on my watch!
<P>
  Even though 50 years have passed since Sir John Slessor made his observations, I still don t believe we can claim
to know all there is to know about airpower, or the possibilities it offers.  We have much to learn.  That s what makes this
such a great time to be in the United States Air Force!  It also puts a premium on the requirement to plan for the future.
<P>
  We will take the time and effort to explore the future; however, our studies and investigations, as interesting as they
may be, will not be useful unless the Air Force develops a process to act on them.  So, I ve tasked a new office under Major
General John Gordon to institutionalize long-range planning in the Air Force and integrate all of the great work underway
that I ve just described.
<P>
  We have always conducted some form of long-range planning in the Air Force, but today we lack an institutionalized
process to ensure it receives the attention and priority it deserves.  I envision John Gordon s role as one in which he
addresses deficiencies in our long range planning process.  For example, the Air Force needs a shared, long-range vision
of its future role in joint warfighting.  If we view and define our capabilities only through the lenses of our individual
stovepipes, then we will never be able to produce a comprehensive vision.  
 <P>
 Another concern is that we have generally taken an incremental approach to our planning processes over the last
few years.  And we have not always spoken with one voice about the importance of airpower.  As a result, we have not
been as articulate as we ought to be in the joint arena, to the Congress, even among ourselves!  Finally, our long-term
modernization plans assume relatively constant funding levels and mission priorities, when our own historical experience
suggests otherwise.
 <P>
 I ve given this new office an 18-month sundown clause, but not the long-range planning function itself.  My ultimate
goal is to institutionalize this process in the corporate Air Force, so it will endure well after General Gordon and I, and the
other senior leaders who have supported this initiative, depart the scene.  However, the 18-month timeline was not selected
in a random fashion.  It was designed to ensure the Air Force would be prepared for coming events.  In short, it provides
a sufficient period of time to get throughthe "quadrennial strategy review" that I expect will occur based on the
recommendations of the Commission on Roles and Missions in their recent report.  If my dates are correct, then such a
revision would occur in the spring of 1997.
 <P>
 We want our vision of the future to be an institutional Air Force vision   not my vision, nor the long-range
planner s vision, but an institutional vision.  So, Secretary Widnall and I have established a long-range planning board of
directors with MAJCOM, Air Staff, and Secretariat participation to help guide the process and ensure broad, Air
Force-wide ownership of our long-range vision.   We see this board of directors composed primarily of the vice
commanders of the MAJCOMs and chaired by the Vice-Chief, with participation by key staff members.
<P>
  Its okay to plan for the future, but the future can come upon us suddenly, so we must prepare for the future as well. 
Although we look forward to the fruits and efforts of John Gordon s team, there are already a number of steps we know
we should take now to lay the groundwork for tomorrow s Air Force.  I ll highlight a few examples in the areas of
information, training, technology and concep demonstrators, and organization. 
<P>
  In my view, information has both an ascending and transcending influence on our warfighting capabilities today  
and its importance is growing almost exponentially!  We must look for ways to improve the flow of information to every
soldier, sailor, airman, and marine   whether that
person is in the headquarters or the field   and use this information to improve the capabilities of our weapons, platforms,
and systems; we must protect this information and our means of communicating it against attack; and we must advance
our techniques to deny information to the enemy.  In short, we will invest in the entire spectrum of capabilities we ve
grouped under the rubric "information warfare."
<P>
  Training is an overarching term for all the steps we will take to prepare our people for the challenges of the 21st
century.  For example, we will work to expand early joint experience opportunities, improve leadership training and
specialized technical education, and revise our programs to develop air and space power professionals.  We have a variety
of initiatives in place to address this last concern   examples include the new Air Force intern program; mandatory
commander training for squadron, group, and wing commanders; and revised professional military education programs
that among other things will ensure 100 percent of our company grade officers attend Squadron Officer School. 
<P>
  We will continue work on high payoff technology and concept demonstrators.  The Airborne Laser, "Tier II+" and
"Tier III-" UAVs [Unmanned Aerial Vehicle], depot privatization, and the airpower expeditionary force are some good
examples.  The airborne laser is perhaps the most revolutionary technology we ve seen in the last 40 years.  It will provide
us a robust capability against one of our most challenging threats   the theater ballistic missile.  UAV capabilities provide
exciting opportunities to exploit the range and flexibility of airpower in new ways   including reconnaissance, strike,
communications relay, and battle management.
<P>
  The air expeditionary force offers the theater CINC an innovative means to provide forward presence   quickly
and efficiently.  And privatization offers cost effective alternatives for a variety of non-combat tasks across the force. 
Finally, while I anticipate no substantive organizational changes, we are implementing an integrated process team concept
on the Air Staff in an effort to improve internal communications and achieve process efficiencies.
 <P>
 The last priorityis a logical extension of the ones I ve already discussed.  We all need to get out and tell the Air Force
story.  Our long-range plans and initiatives will not be supported unless we understand them, we articulate them, and we
carry them to the people that need to support them.  This is an area where every member of the Air Force team plays an
important role.  We need to correct widely held misperceptions concerning airpower, and help educate decision-makers,
and the public, on its proper use.
<P>
  We ve got to start by helping people recognize that airpower has fundamentally changed the nature of warfare. 
Airpower s impact is felt throughout the entire spectrum of warfare.  Airpower can be used to indicate concern, to threaten,
and to deter.  It can construct a defense to confuse an adversary.  It can deployforces and give them mobility.  It can support
other forces, both operationally and tactically.  And if needed, airpower can penetrate and strike unilaterally.  In this
manner, airpower has truly changed the essence of warfare.
 <P>
 Through the years, our lack of a coherent airpower doctrine, and our tendency to allow concepts to race ahead of
technology, have produced legitimate skepticism among our comrades-in-arms and political leaders.  And unfortunately,
for all of airpower s value, we can t seem to model it for wargames and simulations with good fidelity.  The models in use
measure only a portion of airpower s contributions   the portion dedicated to support for the land campaign;  and even
that portion of the model is done imperfectly.  
<P>
  One action officer recently captured the problem for me very succinctly.  "Sir," he said, "if you can t simulate it,
it s not real."  Unfortunately, I think this attitude is becoming all too prevalent in the minds of many people.  So, we clearly
need to address the concerns of airpower skeptics, and expand the capabilities of our joint campaign models so that they
accurately represent the contributions of airpower.
 <P>
 I have another, less obvious concern   that is, a widely held belief that airpower is a panacea; that it s a tool to be
called upon regardless of the objectives.  I will tell you that airpower, like any other form of combat, has its limitations,
and no form of combat can be effective in the absence of coherent political and military objectives.
<P>
  In general, though, I believe we have a great story to tell the American people.  It includes the deterrent value of our
ICBMs and bomber force during the Cold War; the many humanitarian efforts starting with Berlin Airlift; the combined
efforts that achieved success in Desert Storm, Vigilant Warrior, and Deliberate Force; and the on-going, four-year air
occupation of Iraq.  These are just a few of the more notable examples.  With these success stories as a backdrop, I d like
to leave you with a few closing thoughts concerning the future of airpower.  I hope they put our priorities in perspective. 
 <P>
 The Air Force is the service of the future.  Throughout history, every empire, every major nation that has dominated
the world stage has had a military structure to sustain that empire.  Rome was defined by its infantry.  Its legions marched
across and conquered the then-known world.  The Pax Romana they brought with them allowed trade and commerce for
centuries.  The British Isles created and held together an empire dominated by a great fleet that secured trade and
commercewell into the modern era.
 <P>
 I sincerely believe that the United States will be judged historically by our pioneering role in air and space   as the
first "modern" nation   the nation that brought commercial and military aviation from Kitty Hawk to the moon.  The
Roman Phalanx and the British Dreadnought all dominated some element of warfare for decades or centuries.  How long
airpower will dominate is unpredictable; that it now plays a dominant role is undeniable.
<P>
  When America s power is challenged, your Air Force is the first to arrive and the first to fight.  We can employ
while others deploy, and we are ready to fight on arrival.  We bring the land force components to the fight, and control the
air to provide them freedom of maneuver.  We sustain military operations during the fight; and we contribute the decisive
air and space assets   across the theater and the globe   that ultimately win the Nation s wars.
 <P>
 Air and space power is the force of the future and the Air Force   the Nation s Air Force   is dedicated to provide
air and space power as the sole purpose of its existence.  It is the one instrument in our national arsenal with the ability to
project the full weight of America s military might to any corner of the globe at any time our national command authorities
choose.  It is an economy of force service that provides a broad spectrum of capabilities.  These capabilities allow us to
minimize the risk to our most precious national resource   America s young men and women.  This is what Global Reach,
Global Power, and Global Presence mean today, and in the 21st century! 
 <P>
 I anticipate that air and space power will be increasingly seen as the great enabler that allows all services to optimize
their contributions to America s national security.  Hopefully, our efforts during the coming year will ensure we have
considered every likely alternative; explored every known opportunity; laid the long-
term foundation for tomorrow s new requirements; and developed a comprehensive and systematic plan to provide the right
force for the future.  This force will be the kind Deputy Secretary of Defense John White described as ".... a force that, in
fact, has enhanced combat capability; that operates efficiently; and most importantly, is innovative   so it is flexible and
able to meet new requirements."
 <P>
 Secretary White s description sounds like our Air Force today   the Air Force General "Hap" Arnold demanded
of us almost 50 years ago.  But, I m even more excited by our prospects for the future!  I look forward to working with all
of you as we move this great Air Force forward into the 21st century.
<P>

  <I>GENERAL SHAUD:</I>  Chief, thank you for being available to take questions.  You have spoken often of revolutionary
planning and the new aspects of information warfare.  Do you foresee further changes in the Air Force organization as
concept and doctrine evolve in these areas?
  <I>GENERAL FOGLEMAN:</I>  I don t see great changes in this area.  As you know, we ve stood up an information warfare
squadron down at Ninth Air Force.
<P>
  Last year, not too long after I left this symposium, I went back to the Air Staff and I asked to see the smartest people we
had who were engaged in the information warfare business.  They sent me Bob Linhard [Maj. Gen. Robert E. Linhard,
Director of Plans, DCS Plans & Operations] and Ken Minihan [Maj. Gen. Kenneth A Minihan, Assistant Chief of Staff,
Intelligence].  So I sat down and asked them to prepare a presentation for me that addresses information warfare from a
doctrinal standpoint.  This is a subject we can continue to jawbone about forever, but we ve got to get started.  So I wanted
to understand doctrinally how information warfare fits within the Air Force. 
<P>
  Some months before, we had a four-star summit on information warfare, and quite frankly I didn t come away from the
summit with a very good feeling.   So, Bob Linhard and Ken Minihan put together a great pitch.  They said information
warfare needs to be viewed on one-level like the application of traditional air power.  That is, it has a dimension that is
defensive; it also has a dimension that is offensive; and it has a dimension that is in the support realm.  If you go look at
our current doctrine, we have at thing called counter defensive air.  Why don t we have counter defensive information
applications?  We have offensive air.  Why don t we have offensive information operations?  We already have support
functions.  
 <P>
 That seemed to strike a chord with those who have viewed this briefing.  But, what was important from my perspective,
having come from being a CINC, was that unless you coordinate with the CINCs, you will continue to jawbone and nothing
is going to happen.  So we sent these guys on the road to visit every CINC, and they briefed Bill Owens [Admiral William
A. Owens, Vice Chairman, JCS] and other groups around Washington.  Everywhere they went they were greeted with great
excitment because they put meat on the bones of information warfare.  When it was all over, we asked, "What is the next
step?"  
<P>
  Clearly the CINCs want this capability.  How do you give them this capability?  Within our current organization and
structure, we have an air operations center.  That air operations center is in charge of defensive, offensive air, and support
air, so why wouldn  you somehow integrate information warfare into that air operations center?  That was the genesis of
establishing an information warfare squadron.
<P>
  It violates every principle of organization.  We have invented a squadron that doesn t have a unit manning document, and
doesn t have an equipment list.  We told them to figure out what it is they need and come back and tell us.  But we have
a squadron, and we have people who are focusing on it and thinking about it, and we know how we will employ it.   
 <P>
 The CINCs know how the Air Force will employ information warfare.  They can go to their air component commander
who will have the capability to support information warfare within his bag of tricks. 
<P>
  <I>GENERAL SHAUD:</I>  Thank you sir.  First, should the Air Force's Global Reach and Global Power concept be updated
to include Global Presence?  Second, Air Force Doctrine 1-1 has served us well, however, it fails to meet the needs of
future Air Force Global Reach and Global Power.  When will the doctrine be rewritten to reflect what the Air Force does
and should do to meet future needs?
<P>
  <I>GENERAL FOGLEMAN:</I>   Let me take the second question.  The doctrine is undergoing a rewrite right now.  But in
all candor, I will probably hold off making decisions.  I hesitate to rush the publication of a new doctrine manual before
we complete our long-range planning initiative.  I see these as concurrent efforts that are ongoing.  When we are done with
our long-range planning effort, I anticipate we will have a corporate buy-in so we can then publish a new doctrinal manual. 
Hopefully, it will support our move to the future.  
<P>
  Your first question addresses the rewrite of Global Reach and Global Power.  In fact, the staff has already rewritten Global
Reach and Global Power to incorporate the idea of Global Presence.  I am reluctant to publish it.  Before we publish a new
Global Reach and Global Power, I am trying to get people to read the old one.  The Air Force was the first of the services
to produce a post-Cold War strategic vision and architecture.  It was produced in an environment that was pretty amazing
to me.  I can brag on this document because I had nothing to do with it.  I was an observer on the Air Staff, and I got to read
some early versions. In the post-Cold War environment when the Berlin Wall came down and the Warsaw Pact came apart,
it wasn t the military that sensed that the situation had changed.  It was in fact the politicians who saw it.  It was led by
President Bush who on August, 2, 1990, announced a new national security strategy, a post-Cold War strategy, for this
country.  
 <P>
 The very same day Bush was saying, we are going to bring our forces back from overseas Saddam Hussein attacked
Kuwait.  He said we are going to just leave enough forces forward to provide a presence that will facilitate the
reintroduction of troops from the United States if they have to go to the aid of allies, provide humanitarian assistance, or
unilaterally support some U.S.  interest.  President Bush implied we should bring forces back and if the mission is no longer
relevant in this post-Cold War world, we are going to disband the forces.  He said, if the mission is relevant but due to the
post-Cold War environment we are on a longer mobilization timeline, put those missions in the Guard and Reserve.  What
is left will go in the active force.  Essentially, he said we will have a CONUS based contingency force that is going to be
the core of the U.S. military structure, and we will respond to crisis from the continental United States.
 <P>
 While that was being developed within the National Security Council, the Secretary of the Air Force was Don Rice and
the Chief of Staff was Larry Welch.  They were pretty well wired into what as going on in town.  They knew that the
strategy was going to change on a national level.  They put the Air Staff and the Secretariat together to address what the
Air Force should look like in a post-Cold War environment.  The product was called Global Reach and Global Power. 
It had one glaring deficiency.  The name rolls off your tongue.  Global Reach/Global Power   so it became a bumper
sticker.  Nobody read the document.  Everybody said, "What does the Air Force do for the nation?"   We replied, "Global
Reach and Global Power," but what does it mean?  Beats the hell out of me.  Global Reach and Global Power, that is
what we do.  
<P>
  If you read the document, there were five specific things that we do for the nation in a post-Cold War environment.  Those
five things drove the reorganization that occurred a year or so later, and they have driven our modernization priorities ever
since.  A lot of the Air Force has never read the document.  We updated the document in 1992, in the post-Desert Storm
time frame, and it was a good update, but it didn t change the basic document very much.
 <P>
 Interestingly enough, in both the basic document and in the 1992 version, there is absolutely no mention of information
warfare, which shows how rapidly this has burst onto the scene.  
 <P>
 This a long answer to a short question.  The staff has rewritten Global Reach and Global Power, but I am reluctant at this
time to have that rewrite published because I would like to get us focused on those core capabilities that were laid out in
Global Reach and Global Power, augmented by information warfare.  It will allow us to continue to focus on those key
areas as we go forward and not get confused by a new document, and a new title.  We are struggling with that.
  <P>
<I>GENERAL SHAUD:</I>  Chief, let me ask you a question that is a hot topic in Washington.  Do you expect a Bottom Up
Review II and do you think that 20 wings will remain in the force structure?
<P>
  <I>GENERAL FOGLEMAN:</I>  I think I answered that somewhat in my speech.  In the Roles and Missions Commission
Report, one of the recommendations was for a quadrennial national security strategy review.  As you know, the commission
delivered the report to Secretary Perry.  Secretary Perry was required by law to comment on all the recommendations and
then forward it to the Congress.  On the recommendation for the quadrennial military security strategy review, essentially
he said I think this is a good idea, but I cannot commit the Department to do such a review because it will occur in a new
administration.  Whether that is a new Clinton Administration or a new president s administration is irrelevant.  It will
occur in a new administration.  And he went on to say, however, he would generally recommend that such a review be
conducted by his successor.  
 <P>
 The last time we did such a review, it was called the Bottom Up Review and it was done in the spring of 1993.  If this
recommendation of the commission is accepted, then we would do another review, and it would be in the spring of 1997. 
Not that I have any great insight or took a walk last week and came across a burning bush, but this is already in motion,
and so I think there is a high degree of probability that such areview will occur and that is really the impetus behind a lot
of the actions that we are taking now in the Air Force to prepare ourselves to be corporately and institutionally ready to
enter that fray.  
 <P>
 The second part of the question asked if such a review takes place, will we still have 20 tactical fighter wings?    I don t
know.  If you review the current two MRC [Major Regional Contingency] strategy, the United States Air Force swings
more of its force structure than any other service, which means we got pretty small during the first go round.  It is
appropriate that we swing most of our force structure because we are the most flexible, and the most agile of the services. 
We swing a large percentage of our bomber force and a good percentage of our fighter force from one contingency to the
other.  Depending on what kind of a strategy we come with, it will be very difficult in my view to take us down much
further.  
  <P>
<I>GENERAL SHAUD:</I>  Chief, let me ask you one more question.  I have a lot of questions here about B-2s, B-2
procurement and all the rest of the force structure.  Has any progress been made in delineating our service roles in deep
strike mission and how will that relate to the B-2?
 <P>
 <I>GENERAL  FOGLEMAN:</I>  There is an ongoing effort, but we are not anticipating a lot of progress until March of 1996
when a Deep Battle Study, which is being conducted under the auspices of Ted Warner [Edward L. Warner, III, ASD for
Strategy & Requirements] reports to the Secretary.  Again, this was one of those taskings that came out of the Roles and
Missions report.  That is an ongoing debate, and we are engaged in it.  I have no real feel for how that is going as we go,
but we should have some resolution on that.
 <P>
 <I>GENERAL SHAUD:</I>  Thank you very much, Sir, it is great having you with us.  Thanks for what you do for our nation.
 <P>
 <I>GENERAL  FOGLEMAN:</I>  Thank you all.  <HR>

The Honorable Darleen Druyun<BR>
Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for Acquisition (Acting)<BR>
Los Angeles AFA Symposium<BR>
October 27, 1995<BR>
<P>
<CENTER><B>Acquisition Reformed</B></CENTER> 
<P>
  Ladies, gentlemen, distinguished guests and members of the Schriever Chapter of the Air Force Association, it is a
real pleasure for me to have the opportunity to talk about where we are going in the area of acquisition, particularly in
acquisition reform.  
 <P> My comments today are going to concentrate on where we have been and where we are going on our journey down
the acquisition streamlining highway.  I do mean highway because I think we are beginning to really pick up some
speed.  I d like to share with you some of our recent success stories and later on listen to some of your ideas and
questions.  I do have to say that the Air Force Association has just been extremely supportive of our efforts to get out
and really make acquisition reform a reality.  The Air Force Association is generous enough to help us sponsor four
seminars around the country and allow our partners in industry the opportunity to deal with this first hand and give us
ideas on how we can continue to make really great progress in terms of acquisition reform.  
 <P> Sometimes I am asked, "Why do we need to continue on our path to change the way we do business?"  The hard
core reality is that the Air Force s investment budget is at its lowest level since 1985.  Our 1995 investment budget is
one-third of the 1985 level.  As a share of the total Air Force budget, our investment spending has gone from about
one-half the Air Force s total budget in 1985 to about one-third of the budget today.  To maintain a modern and
effective Air Force, and we heard General Fogleman speak about that very clearly, we must drive down the costs of
acquiring systems.  Acquisition reform is absolutely critical to afford future modernization.  This reform is done by
adopting commercial practices, clearly developing a government-contractor partnership, getting away from an
adversarial relationship that we ve had over the years, looking at cost as an independent variable, and reducing cycle
time.  It just takes too long today to get those requirements out to the user.  
<P>  The entire DoD senior leadership has really declared war on the acquisition process.  The acquisition reform
initiatives are clearly not a fad.  It is supported by every member of the DoD team.  
<P>  It is interesting to note that General Fogleman last month as a guest speaker at Air Force Materiel Command s CEO
conference had some very cogent comments and I d like to just quote from one of them.  He said, "The senior
leadership of the Air Force is going to support people who have the vision and the courage to step up to initiatives like
the Lightning Bolts.  We will nurture and promote the innovators, the people who can think outside the box, and, I
have to tell you, "Thinking outside the box is critical in acquisition reform."  We are going to rewad people who can
get things done, who are not afraid to give us their opinions.  We need to train the old school of thought right out of
our workforce."  
<P>  We are engaged in a significant culture change with respect to how we do  acquisition.  I absolutely agree with
General Fogleman.  We have got to get rid of the old school of thought, which requires all of us to engage in what I
would term guerrilla warfare battles, to fight those individuals within the system  who refuse to change.  All of us
know that there are areas within the acquisition process and within our process that must be streamlined.  Just as
industry has made those tough decisions to downsize, we too are making those tough decisions within Air Force
acquisition.  As I ve stated many times, we need to look at our organizations, identify what is value added and
eliminate non-value added elements, processes, and practices.  This will allow us to capture hidden costs so we can
take and reinvest those savings in the future modernization efforts of the United States Air Force.  
 <P> Each of us in this audience knows where many of those non-value added tasks are.  I think all of us know how we
need to attack them and begin to get rid of them.  I challenge each of you not to sit back and wait for us to step out. 
This is a partnership.  I expect industry to work jointly with us and with our SPO [System Program Office] directors, to
look at your existing contracts and to come back to us and say, "I don t need all these milspecs and milstandards. 
What are you doing with all of these mountainous piles of paper that I give to you on a monthly basis?  They cost you
money and they cost me money."  
<P>  Yes, I recognize that in the way we write our contracts they are very much cost based and that your profit depends
on that, but remember, there are things like value engineering change proposals, in which you can come back to us and
say, "I can save you money; let s have some sort of sharing arrangement."  We need to find ways to motivate each
other to make those smart decisions.
<P>  What are the ramifications of our reforms?"  I think Air Force reforms in acquisition are beginning to pay big
dividends.  I want to talk about a couple of programs to let you see the path upon which we are moving.  We have
some pilot programs, like the JDAM [Joint Direct Attack Munition], and JPATS [Joint Primary Aircraft Training
System], the next trainer for AETC [Air Education and Training Command].  We also lead programs like Wind
Corrected Munitions, Space-based Infrared Satellite System and the Evolved Expandable Launch Vehicle.  These
programs have all used acquisition reform methods to change the way we acquire these new military capabilities in
addition to relying on commercial products to satisfy military requirements.  What is important to each and every
person in this room today is that w began to institutionalize these changes.  
 <P> In my opinion, we have a very rare opportunity over the next two to three years to finish that cultural change and
make acquisition reform something that is lasting, not something that is just passing in the night. 
 <P> How do we institutionalize our successes?  In the last four months, I have had four off-sites with my program
directors, with my PEOs, and with my designated acquisition commanders to share with them the success stories and
also those that have not worked well.  We are spreading the word and opening up our minds to think outside that box. 
As we have traveled around with the Air Force Association, I have had contractors come up and say that we are talking
the talk but not walking the walk. While I agree with that statement, I once again challenge you through partnership
with us to go back and take a look at your individual contracts and figure out how we can do it smarter, better, faster,
cheaper.  You are going to hear me say the words, better, faster, cheaper a number of times today because that s where
we want to go in acquisition reform.
 <P> I spent a lot of years working with the space community including two years with NASA.  Within the Air Force, it
used to be a common statement that the space community was different.  The space community and acquisition reform
is different.  The space community is paving the path of how we can take our old fashioned processes and throw them
out the window and find much better and more effective ways of doing things.  SBIRS, EELV, GPS [Global
Positioning System] and Milstar are some very great examples that we have today of what we ve done to begin that
path of changing how we do business.  
 <P> Historically the acquisition community is perceived as being "risk averse" and unwilling to change.  I have an
expression in my own organization.  I call it the "W" word: wimps, whiners or warriors.  I have challenged each and
every one of my acquisition personnel to become acquisition warriors.  Every time I hear someone complaining about
something or saying it is too hard to do, I look at them and say, "Remember the "W" word.  We are not wimps.  We
are acquisition warriors.  We are leaders."  Everyone of us needs to step up to really being a leader in everything that
we do on a daily basis.  
  <P>If I could turn for a few minutes and talk about some real success stories that show we can do things better, faster
and cheaper and get those requirements delivered earlier to the user.  
 <P> The first one is called JDAM.  By taking a kit and putting it on a dumb bomb, we make it into a "smart" bomb. 
Back in August of 1993, we put out an RFP to get this program rolling.  It is interesting when I compare the RFP that
we put out in August 1993 to the one that we put out in October 1995.  Back in August 1993 we tried as much as
possible to engage in real acquisition reform.  It was really our first attempt.  You can see how far we have gone when I
give you some statistics.  
 <P> The number of milspecs and milstandards on my RFP in August 1993 was 87.  We didn t put out another RFP; why
should I put out another pile of paper?  When I put out our call for improvements, we put out a simple little letter, a
two-page letter, and termed it a call for improvements.  We had zero milspecs and milstandards in that document. 
Back in August of 1993, I had a 138 page Statement of Work.  We got rid of that Statement of Work because it gets
into far too much detailtelling our contractors how to do their work.  I personally believe that contractors out there
don t need to get that type of detail.  Instead, we went to a two-
page Statement of Objectives.  We went from 234 CDRLs [Contract Data Requirement List] down to 29; that is
tremendous reduction in paperwork that cost us money.  Back in August 1993, when we put out that RFP, our average
unit procurement price goal for 40,000 units was $40,000.  That $40,000 was a number we had derived doing things
our traditional way.  When we made that contract award approximately a month ago, we reduced the $40,000 to
$18,000.  In fact, the average unit procurement price for a procurement of 76,000 units will drop to less than $13,000
per kit.  
 <P> What is important to me is that originally we thought the development time would take us 46 months.  We now
have it down to 30 months.  We had two superb contractor teams, Lockheed Martin and McDonnell Douglas,
competing head to head.  I took our source selection rules and threw them out the window.  I didn t use a 70-15 split. 
We actually did what I would term a "rolling down" select.  We allowed our program director to come up with a set of
criteria.  We shared it with the contractors and evaluated the contractors every six months over an 18-month period to
see how well they were doing with the promises that they made to us and the contracts that we awarded to them.  More
importantly, as we concluded the first 18-month period of engineering manufacturing development, it became clear
that I could give back about $1.5 billion worth of costs to our user, Air Combat Command, by reducing production
time from 15 years to 11 years.  Why?  Because the kit price was not going to be about $40,000; the kit price was
going to drop to less than $13,000 over a production run of approximately 80,000 units.  The message I try to give each
time as I talk to our acquisition personnel is that we can make a difference.  We can give back dividends to each of our
users.  That is my goal.  
 <P> As we work through our budgets, our goal is to give money back to our users so they can reinvest that to help us
modernize the U. S. Air Force.  Once again, faster, better, cheaper.  JDAM is a great example of how we can do that.  
 <P> Another example I d like to use is  Peace Shield.  Peace Shield is a program we have with the Royal Saudi Air
Force.  Yesterday, I had the opportunity of presenting a $50 million check to the Hughes Corporation for some
outstanding work they did with Peace Shield.  The first time we did Peace Shield we didn t do very well.  We
terminated that contract, but we turned around, did another quick competition and this time picked Hughes
Corporation.  We told the contractor it is important to the Royal Saudi Air Force that they get a command and control
system that meets their needs.  We laid in a 54 month schedule, but we put a $50 million bonus in there if the
contractor could deliver that system in 48 months or less.  
  <P>I became deeply involved in that program approximately 3  years ago, when I came back to the Air Force, and the
contractor at the time was about 12-14 months behind schedule in software.  Once we focused on the issues, we came
up with an integrated management schedule and worked together as a team, as a partnership, and the contractor was
able to turn around his software deficiencies.  In fact, he didn t deliver the system six months early, he deliveed the
system seven months early.  He under-ran the target cost of the contract.  To me that is another excellent story of what
one can do in acquisition reform.  What is interesting to note is the program director, Gary Smith, was a few years
ahead of the rest of the acquisition community.  The idea of putting a performance incentive and putting a significant
amount of money to it, was a very attractive feature that we are going to try to roll into some of our future acquisitions
as we try to do things better, faster and cheaper.  
  <P>More importantly, if you looked at his SPO size back in 1992, the Peace Shield program office had 325 people in it. 
I asked Gary to put himself on what I termed the "Slim Fast" diet.  Once again, that is a lot of folks, and a lot of
paperwork that is being put together, and it costs money to have an organization that large.  Today, that program office
is down to 105 people and is continuing to shrink, even though we have a significant follow-on activity in the Peace
Shield area.  
  <P>What am I talking about in terms of dollars? That is not a lot of money, but it is $25 million we did not have to take
out of TOA and invest to pay for people costs and paper costs.  I challenge each one of my program offices to do a
stretch goal to try to reduce the size of our program offices by 50 percent over the next four years.  I believe it is
reasonable.  Remember, the money is coming from the Air Force, and it is coming from our users   our CINCs, and
our major command commanders.  It is our duty and responsibility to give them best value, to do it better, faster and
cheaper.  
  <P>Another example is Milstar.  I ve had folks say to me you can t take an existing program and go back and change
that contract.  I have news for you. You can; you should; and you must.  Milstar is a great example of where
acquisition reform is paying great dividends.  We have cut the program and cut and cut on an annual basis.  I know
General Ashy finds it to have been a very painful process.  The last cut in the Milstar program was for $236 million.  
  <P>Program directors say, "I really don t know how we are going to take and implement that program with the cuts that
we are seeing."  The challenge for the acquisition community is to go ahead and see what we can do to really try to
reduce costs.  So I challenged the SPO director, working as a partner with the Lockheed Martin team and their major
subcontractors, to go in there and take a look at what are the cost drivers in that existing contract.  It is interesting what
General Kwiatkowski [Brig. Gen. Leonard F. Kwiatkowski] did in that area.  I consider him to be a leader in
acquisition reform.  We took an existing contract and we deleted a number of CDRLs.  We went from 126 down to 51. 
We had 110 milspecs and milstandards in that contract and we got rid of many of them.  The new number is now 43. 
We used to be involved in  301 government acceptance events in that procurement.  Think about it   301 acceptance
events.  That is a lot of people and a lot of paperwork.  We now have one event, DPRO [Defense Plant Representative
Office] inspections.  The DPRO used to go in and do approximately 38,000 inspections as we built up the satellite to
get it ready to be launched.  Today we ve changed that and brought it down to 100 inspection points.  Finally, and most
importantly, we reduced the Milstar budget by approximately $236 million.  We are able to continue to deliver a
satellite that meets all of General Ashy s requirements.  But we did it better.  We did it faster.  We did it cheaper.  
 <P> I have a couple of other stories I d like to tell you about.  Another one is in a program called PACER CRAG.  This
is an avionics modernization effort with the KC-135 program.  This is a program at an air logistics center.  My own
folks told me it is a lot harder to do acquisition reform in an air logistics center, so I picked PACER CRAG as a case of
where, working together, we can do smart things.  I took a look at the original RFP.  I was very unhappy with it.  It had
far too many CDRLs, and it had far too many milspecs.  I couldn t understand why we had a lengthy Statement of
Work.  I was not thrilled with the procurement.  I picked up the phone and talked with General Eickmann [Maj. Gen.
Kenneth E. Eickmann] at the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center.  He agreed we could do better.  "We re going to put
together a red team to help the SPO scrub that document and get an amendment out to industry and do it very quickly." 
<P>
  General Fogleman expressed some concern to me that we were going to delay this procurement.  After seeing the
foot-thick document sitting on my table he said, "I understand, but do smart things with it, and remember, we d like to
get that contract awarded on time.  We don t want to delay it; it is an important user requirement."  I am pleased to
report that when we did go and put out an amendment, we got rid of the Statement of Work   60 pages in length.  We
went to a Statement of Objectives that was 10 pages in length.  We went from 331 CDRLs, which was driving that
huge pile of paper I showed General Fogleman, down to 39.  
  <P>That certainly saves money on a contractor s part.  We went from 6 milspecs and milstandards to zero.  I am proud
to report the team under the leadership of General Eickmann awarded that contract one week early.  And I am able to
give back to the user $90 million over the FYDP.  The simple message is: We can do it better.  We can do it faster. 
We can do it cheaper.
  <P>The last example I d like to use is the GPS story.  This is an example of how you can sit down and take a hard look
at what is driving the cost of a large SPO and how can I give some money back to General Ashy so he can take and
reinvest that in the future of the Air Force.  It was clear when we sat down and looked at all the individual contracts,
there was a lot that could be done.  For example, we had six contractors working on the ground station doing software
updates and helping us to keep the ground systems operational.
    <P>We laid out an overall acquisition strategy where we would go from six contractors to one.  It was a hard fought
battle. Some of the functionals in OSD did not want us to write a contract that would allow me to buy a whole
constellation and then some.  They wanted me to recompete this thing every five years.  They got sick of hearing from
me.  I probably went down there three days a week and logically and rationally took them through why it was the right
thing to do.  In laying out our acquisition strategy, we put out an RFP, first  working in the ground stations,
consolidating six contracts into one.  We know how precious O&M money is to our CINCs and to our major
commands.  We are in the process of source selection for GPS.  Once again,I ersonally looked at that RFP, I talked to
everyone of the competitors individually.  It is a model of how we can do acquisition reform.  I expect, General Ashy,
to do that better, faster, cheaper and to give money back to you so you can reinvest it in the future of the Air Force.  
 <P> What does all this mean? Clearly, it is up to you and me.  We must form a partnership and we must work as a team. 
It means that you can change the way that you do business.  You just have to want to do it.  You can be a whiner, a
wimp or a warrior.  On my part, I choose to be a warrior.
  <P>As we have more and more successes, the oversight process will decrease on those companies and programs that
prove that they are top performers.  JDAM is an excellent example of that.  In the JDAM program, we entered into an
agreement with the contractor that we would draw out most of our DPRO oversight as long as the contractor remained
on track, as long as he remained within that commitment curve with respect to how we laid out a future pricing of that
kit.  The government is going to stay out of the contractor s hair.  We have brought the program office down from 75
people to 40.  The number is going to continue to drop.  We also want very much to make sure that we have the right
carrot and  stick in the contract to keep a contractor motivated, so the government doesn t have to.  We put some
carrots and sticks in the contract.  It says we are going to stay with you on a sole source basis for the life of the
production of these items as long as you stay on that commitment curve and as long as you deliver me a quality
product.  That is the kind of commitment that we are making to the contractor, McDonnell Douglas.  I feel very
confident that we are going to be able to live up to that commitment.  
 <P> In trying to conclude my remarks, I want to stress to you that experience, teamwork and communication are critical
if we are going to continue down this path of acquisition reform, and if we are going to change the paradigm and
achieve lasting reforms.  I believe that vision, drive, energy, singleness of purpose, wise use of resources, and a
commitment to a destiny are characteristics of an organization that excels.  Those are going to be the characteristics of
Air Force acquisition.  
<P>  I know this is true because these are the characteristics of some of the programs that I ve spoken about   JDAM,
Milstar, GPS, Peace Shield, PACER CRAG.  I could probably stand up here for another 10 minutes and name many
other programs.  You and I are the leaders in the acquisition community.  You must be innovative and use the lessons
we have already learned to move forward and continue down that path of acquisition reform.  It is time for each of us
to join hands with the warfighter and become a warrior in the acquisition community with the battle cry, better, faster,
cheaper.  Thank you.
<P>
  <I>GENERAL SHAUD:</I>  Darleen, we have a number of questions.  First, apparently DSMC [Defense Systems
Management College] out of Belvoir [Fort Belvoir, Va.] is teaching the old ways of doing business.  Why isn t the
schoolhouse at the leading edge of reform?
<P> <I> MS. DRUYUN:</I>  That is an excellent question.  We have had some lengthy discussions with the folks over at the
Defense Systems Management College.  Unfortunately, it seems like it takes our training community a little too long to
get up to what I would term "reality."  I can tell you that General Claude Bolton is actively changing the curriculum,
but in the interim he is bringing in the leaders of acquisition reform such as Colleen Preston [DUSD for Acquisition
Reform], for example, Paul Kaminski [USD for Acquisition & Technology], Noel Longuemare [ PDUSD for
Acquisition & Technology], myself, Army and Navy folks, and more importantly, bringing in SPO [System Program
Office] directors, like Terry Little for example, and Craig Weston, who heads up the Space-Based Infrared System
[SBIRS].  He has them share real time stories and tell what acquisition reform is all about.
 <P> In addition, so far I ve had four off-sites with each of the services.  I have another one coming up and Blaise
Durante probably pulls out what little hair is left in his head putting together first class training programs.  AFMC [Air
Force Materiel Command] is actively involved in road show training.  We are taking that training, and we are giving it
to our partners in industry because this is not just a question of retraining the blue suiters and the civilians in how you
go about doing acquisition reform.  It is retraining the whole acquisition workforce.  And our contractor community is
a very important part of that.  The bottom line is, yes, DSMC is slow.  They are getting up to speed very quickly, but in
the interim we are getting the right people in there to talk about the techniques that one needs to use to engage in doing
things better, faster and cheaper.  
<P>  <I>GENERAL SHAUD:</I>  Darleen, let me combine a number of questions dealing with milspecs.  "Milspecs grew in
part in response to specific problems around equipment failures.  If problems occur  in the future, and all programs
are very likely to have problems, won t we see pressure to reimpose milspecs?"  Let me also go to the next one.  "I
understand the logic of getting away from military standards and specs, but the major complaint from many
contractors is that their systems are already conforming with milspecs and with little or no commercial business, it is
cost prohibitive to change."  
 <P> <I>MS. DRUYUN:</I> Let me address the whole issue of milspecs.  The Department of Defense is engaged in a very
active program to scrub through every milspec and milstandard that is currently in its catalogue.  The fact remains that
I expect probably 70 percent of those milspecs and milstandards are going to be thrown out the window.  A good
number of them have already been tossed out.  There will be some that will be retained.  There will be some that we
will continue to update.  
 <P> There is a significant issue here.  If you start using milspecs and milstandards that we are going to be thrown out the
window and updated, who is going to take on the responsibility of trying to keep those updated.  That is an issue we
are working on with some of the industry associations.  Yes, there are going to be times when we are going to fail in
the program.  But I am here to tell you that we have enough failures in the past in programs we have worked on that
were replete with tons and tons of milspecs and milstandards and CDRLs [Contract Data Requirement List] up the
gazoo, but it still didn t help us get there in terms of successfully delivering a product to the user.  
 <P> It is incumbent on acquisition leaders, and I certainly consider myself to be an acquisition leader, to stand up and ay,
"Yes we had a failure, but no, this is not the reason to reimpose all of this system that we are trying to climb out from
under."  I stressed to the acquisition community we should be using best practices.  Contractors have many best
practices.  The government, believe it or not, also has some best practices, and we should be molding the two of these
together.  From some of the competitions we have done, we are seeing a blend of best practices, i.e., continuing to use
the milspecs and milstandards because industry that is competing on a given procurement believes it is the right thing
to do.  But I ve also seen industry come in and say, "I am going to use my own process that I use today."  For example,
use them in building commercial satellites or building commercial launch vehicles.  This is going to be an area where
we are going to have to work our way through, but be smart as to how we do it.  The current leadership inDoD,
beginning with Dr. Perry [William J. Perry, Secretary of Defense], Dr. Kaminski, Noel Longuemare, and the Secretary
of the Air Force, believe we need to reach out there, get out of that box, be bold, recognize once in a while we are
going to fail, but pick out the crumbs, and get on with delivering the requirement to a user.  I have found myself
spending a fair amount of my time working with what I term problem programs.  But I have also found some
interesting facts.  
  <P>I find if a contractor puts together a true integrated management schedule you can identify what the problems are on
the horizons, you can develop work-arounds and you can make that schedule a living, breathing document and work
through the issues.  I have also found in areas where we have problems in programs that I periodically get together with
the chief executive officer of that company and I find suddenly there is a lot of talent being focused on what is
potentially a broken program.  And guess what?  By the time we work our way through it, it is not broken.  
  <P>Peace Shield is very good example.  And, I can give you numerous examples of programs I have worked on
personally in the last three years.  It is a simple message I want to get to you:  You shouldn t use milspecs and
milstandards as a crutch.  You shouldn t use that as an excuse for failure and, therefore, shouldn t break out of this box
and try to do something new and different.  Recognize that you have the support of your leaders from the top beginning
with OSD, through the Air Force, down through General Viccellio s [Gen. Henry Viccellio, Jr., AFMC] program
executive officers, your DACs [Defense Acquisition Center], and as we find we have problems, I am going to roll up
my sleeves.  
  <P>If it is a problem, for example out at the Space and Missile Systems Center, General Lyles [Lt.Gen. Lester L. Lyles]
is going to roll up his sleeves and the institutional Air Force, working in integrated product teams with OSD, is going
to find ways to take and solve those problems.  Sometimes it is going to result in a program termination and going off
in a different path.
  <P><I>GENERAL SHAUD:</I>  Darleen, one last question.  It is the "How much is enough?" question.  How is the senior
leadership assessing the potential risk associated with downsizing, reengineering the System Program Offices?
  <P><I>MS. DRUYUN:</I>  That is an interesting question.  If you were to historically look at the size of our SPOs, you would
find in some of our fighter SPOs that we are not buying F-15s or F-16s right now, except for FMS cases.  This kind of
shocked General Yates [Gen. Ronald W. Yates] when we started sizing the SPOs and looking at where we were today
versus where we were 20 years ago.  One SPO that General Yates used to run, was bigger than when he left it.  When
he left it, they were finishing up engineering manufacturing development.  
 <P> It is easy for us to grow our bureaucracies.  I have found that so true.  If you don t have something to do, you find
something to do.  We are going through the same tough decisions that industry has already been through and as far as I
am concerned, we have got to go through that.  It costs the Air Force money.  It is the users' money that is paying for
the size of my SPOs and paying for al that paperwork.  I want to get rid of that paperwork.  I want to get down to what
is important and really focus in on what is important and managing a program and allow contractors to fully utilize
their talents.  They have great talents to work with us in a partnership so I don t have to have a SPO of 500 or 600
people looking over the contractors  shoulders making sure that they do everything correct.  
  <P>Past performance is the other critical part of what we are doing.  I am a strong believer that I want to do future
business with those contractors who can deliver on their promises.  Which is why, for example, I ve toughened up the
contractor performance assessment report with a simple question that we put at the bottom of each one of those forms
as we look at the progress that contractors have made in the last year.  And the simple question is: "Knowing what I
know today and how well that contractor is performing in that contract today, would I award them the same contract
again?"  It is interesting to see the responses coming through and the attention that is getting within industry.  But I
believe that by coupling past performance, by turning toward a partnership with industry, I don t need to have SPOs
that are hundreds and hundreds of people watching a contractor do something.  I need to become lean and mean like
the rest of the United States Air Force.
  <P><I>GENERAL SHAUD:</I>  Thanks Darleen.  Thanks for being an acquisition warrior.

<P>
  I am always pleased to have the opportunity to return to this forum. 
<P>  I would ask for you to stop for a second and think back to about 1988 and where we stood in the world.  Who would
have thought that by 1989 the Berlin Wall would have been down and within a year we would be fighting a war with
Saddam Hussein; and within the next four years, the Air Force would be about 40 percent smaller.  My point, of
course, is that we are not very good at predicting the future.  I am not sure how we will deal with the challenges ahead
if our visions are so short.  Nevertheless, we must try.  In the case of the United States, we ve answered the rapid
changing environment by adopting a National Security Strategy that calls on our leadership to look at engagement and
enlargement throughout the world.  It is a strategy that seeks to promote democracy abroad and bolster economic
growth with the overall goal of enhancing American security.  To be effective at this strategy, it presumes a continued
U.S. involvement in international affairs.  In fact, it states that American leadership has never been more essential.  
 <P>  As an active participant on the foreign affairs playing field, this strategic vision has demanded major changes in
U.S. military thinking.  In essence, the strategy boils down to one major challenge for the military:  Provide our
national leadership with the military forces and options required to remain effectively engaged in the international
order.  The keystone for successfully meeting this defense challenge and in turn supporting our national strategy is a
robust and responsive lift and power projection capability.  It is that power projection capability that I would like to
discuss with you today.
<P>   Lift is essential because it provides credible power projection and through that projection, capable deterrence. 
Should deterrence fail, lift is the critical factor in delivering forces and providing war fighting capability.  While our
military forces are realigning to CONUS, lift capability becomes even more vital.  Even the most advanced weapons
systems, which we discussed at lunch today, and highly trained personnel are of no use to us unless we can get them to
the war.  I am very fond of telling my fellow compatriots you can t leave home without us.  Without sufficient lift,
forces can t deploy to the theater in time to fight, and they cannot be sustained.  The result is reduced military
effectiveness and ultimately the cost to our nation to be well measured not only in treasure but in blood.  
 <P>  To understand the lift forces we need, let s look at the requirement.  We in the transportation world deal with two
types of requirements.  The first is the day-to-day business of serving U.S. interests around the globe.  The second is
the wartime surge capability to support two major regional contingencies.  In suporting the day-to-day requirement,
TRANSCOM has people deployed around the world.  In a typical peacetime week, AMC [Air Mobility Command]
operates 1,000 missions and over 3,000 sorties into 40 countries.  Our Military Sealift Command has 75 ships
underway, visiting 20 ports in 13 countries.  Our ground component, the Military Traffic Management Command,
manages about 200 major shipments in 27 ports in 13 countries.  
 <P>  This past year we have supported humanitarian relief operations, military exercises and operational deployments on
every continent of the earth.  In fact, we have operated into all but seven nations.  Our wartime lift requirement is
detailed in the recently approved Mobility Requirements Study Bottom Up Review Update [MRS/BURU].   
 <P>  This study set the requirement for sealift, prepositioning and air mobility to support two major regional
contingencies at a moderate level of risk.  I underline moderate level of risk.  In TRANSCOM we are responsible for
bringing those three modes that I talked about earlier together.  I d like to touch a little on the PREPO and sealift
business before moving to air mobility.  
<P>   When it comes to moving large volumes of heavy equipment and supplies, we rely on sealift.  While airlift provides
the capability for a swift response to the needs of a theater CINC, it is largely limited by weight and bulk.  Airlift
provides speed for transporting people and high priority, high value equipment.  But it is sealift that is the backbone of
any major deployment.  The Mobility Requirements Study validated a basic requirement of 10 million square feet of
surge sealift capability.  I realize that some of you may not be familiar with these terms.  So, let me just talk a little bit
about surge sealift and what 10 million square feet means.  
  <P> Surge sealift is the lift required in the first few days of a conflict, while sustainment is the follow-on sustaining
forces and supplies.  Surge sealift is designed to rapidly place a credible military presence on theground and then build
up the force.  During the Cold War, a primary concern was a rapid Soviet strike across the German plains.  We had a
large standing force in Europe.  Our need for surge sealift was small because our halting force was largely in place. 
Now, many of you will remember the days of Desert Shield.  We saw CNN showing us the pictures of lightly armored
troops, the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions spreading out across that desert.  Those troops were ill-equipped to stop
an Iraqi armored attack.  We needed heavy equipment, but we couldn t get it there because we had not planned for
surge sealift.  
 <P>  We have to fix this problem and we are working on that right now.  To give you an idea of the magnitude of the task
we are talking about to move 10 million square feet, that s the equivalent of 126,000 Ford escorts.  We are talking
about getting them to the theater in a matter of weeks   less than a month.  Today we are in the process of acquiring
19 large, medium-speed, roll on, roll off ships to meet this requirement.  
 <P>  While sealift can move large quantities of equipment and supplies, an obvious drawback is its slow speed.  This can
be a major drawback if the nature of the conflict is such that you can t trade territory for time.  In 1973, during the
Yom Kippur war in the Middle East, the Military Airlift Command flew operation Nickel Grass.  The first flights were
arriving in Israel in less than 48 hours.  Subsequently, over the next 30 days, MAC flew 537 sorties and delivered
22,300 tons of equipment.  n contrast, the first ship arriving in Israel delivered 25,000 tons.  The problem is, it arrived
20 days after hostilities started and 12 days after the cease fire.  It was a case of a whole lot, but a little late.  
 <P>  In order to compensate for sealift s relative lack of speed, we have prepositioned some supplies and equipment in
and near our theaters.  This prepositioning takes two forms   afloat and ashore.  One problem with land based
prepositioning is you need to guess correctly where you are going to need it.  Once in place, land based prepositioning
is the least flexible logistics option.  If you guess wrong, you ll need to move it, and you ll have to strain an already
stressed transportation system to do that.  Also, if you don t move troops rapidly to protect ground based equipment,
you could lose it.  
 <P>  To ensure some flexibility in prepositioning, we have decided to put some of it afloat.  We currently have 34 ships
in the Mediterranean, the Pacific and the Indian Oceans.  Such prepositioning gives the flexibility to swing east/west,
and can reduce closure times by about half if you do that, but this enhanced flexibility doesn t come cheap.  As a
matter of fact, it costs us approximately $60-70 thousand dollars a day per ship to put it in the afloat prepositioning
mode.  Additionally, the equipment aboard these ships must be duplicated.  In order to train the troops, you must have
equipment ashore as well as that aboard the ships.  Currently, we are in fairly decent shape because as we have gone
through the drawdown, we have ended up with excess equipment to put on those ships.  As we modernize our
equipment, we face a bill for duplicate equipment for ashore and afloat prepositioning.  
 <P>  Prepositioning and sealift provide a majority of the equipment and supplies necessary for a contingency.  But they
must be married up with the necessary personnel and high value and sophisticated equipment that is not suitable for
prepositioning.  Helicopters and communications gear are good examples.  They don t sit well in the bottom of ships
or out in the desert without a lot of care.  Those high valued equipment and people will be delivered by air.  
 <P>  I know this audience is interested in the air side of the house so let me move there quite rapidly.  MRS/BURU,
again, identified an airlift requirement of 49.4 to 51.8 million ton-miles per day as the requirement to meet two MRCs
[Major Regional Contigencies] with moderate risk.  About this time you are saying, "What is this million ton-mile per
day thing?"  A million ton-miles per day can be moving one million tons one mile in one day or moving one ton a
million miles in one day.  I d like to see the airplane that is going to do the latter.  The Space Shuttle might be able to
handle that, although I don t know.  The C-17 might, too, I d have to see.  
 <P>  Let me illustrate this concept a little bit more clearly.  Being a proud Texan, when we talk about 49 to 52 million
ton miles per day, how much are we talking about? The city of Austin, Texas, is about 450,000 people.  If you took
those 450,000 people and their personal effects and you applied 50 million ton-miles per day, you could move all those
people and all their effects in about 90 days, actually a little less than that.  
 <P>  That s the airlift capacity necessary to support two MRCs.  The current air mobility force can theoretically move
about 48 million ton-miles per day at maximum effort.  In order to meet future requirements, we are focusing our
efforts on three areas.  We are aggressively working to maintain a strong and healthy CRAF [Civil Reserve Air Fleet]
program.  We are modernizing our existing airlift fleet to increase its life span.  And we are pushing the acquisition of
an aircraft to replace the C-141.
  <P> The CRAF serves as the foundation of our air mobility fleet.  Currently, the Civil Reserve Air Fleet contributes over
260 wide-bodied aircraft, which provide over a third of our cargo airlift capability and 90 percent of our passenger lift
capability.  CRAF is a great deal for both Americans and the airlines.  The commitment of our civil carriers allows the
nation to enjoy major cost savings by depending upon the commercial sector for a large share of the airlift capability. 
At the same time, we provide our CRAF carriers with business and revenue to help them remain competitive and
healthy.
 <P>  As an incentive to maintain the level of CRAF commitment, we offer $1.4 billion in DoD and government business
each year to participants.  Additionally, we are in the final stages of instituting a program that will permit CRAF
carriers to use DoD facilities.  CRAF provides a lot of capability, but it cannot do it all.  
 <P>  There exists unique military capabilities that are required of our airlift aircraft   capacity for oversized and
outsized military equipment, air drop delivery of troops and equipment, and operations into austere, remote airfields. 
These capabilities only exist in military aircraft specifically designed for those functions.  
  <P> To help maintain a robust, organic capability, the second program for meeting future requirements is the
modernization of the existing organic fleet.  The last C-141 will retire in 2006.  But in the meantime, we are managing
the fleet by tail number, investing in upgrades to avionics and defensive systems and transferring some of the older
airframes into the unit-equipped Air Reserve Forces to extend their life.  Upgrades for the C-5 and the KC-135 are
focused primarily on the avionics systems.  But they also include engines and landing gear modifications for the C-5 to
improve its reliability, and rollers for the KC-135 to improve its cargo carrying capability.  The avionics upgrades are
vital to ensure our older air frames will be able to operate in the air transportation system of the future.
 <P>   Future requirements for navigation on international routes demand that our aircraft be GPS [Global Positioning
System] equipped as well as carry equipment for terminal collision avoidance and direct data links for reporting along
routes with reduced vertical separation.  In Europe, thre is an especially urgent need to modernize if we plan on
remaining capable of operating under the strict flow control procedures which are just now going into effect.  Some
route restrictions are with us today and others are scheduled for trial periods beginning in January 1997.  The future
viability of our Global Reach concept is dependent upon timely investments to ensure our military fleet can operate
efficiently in the world air traffic control system.  
 <P>  In addition to completing upgrades for our existing organic fleet, we must acquire modern aircraft to meet projected
airlift requirements.  As I mentioned, we need to replace the C-141.  The high Optempo of Desert Shield/Desert Storm
only intensified this need.  The C-141 was originally built in the 1960s; it was stretched in the 70s; and flown hard in
the 80s and 90s.  Its average age is 28 years old   older than the crews that fly it today, on average.  And the service
life has already been extended from 30,000 to 45,000 hours.  The fleet currently averages 37,000 hours, and we ve
already started to retire some of the older aircraft.  In 1981, the Air Force selected the C-17 as the winning design to
replace the C-141.  Acquisition was delayed in the mid-1980s to accommodate a buy of C-5Bs  and KC-10s.  From the
program s inception, changing requirements, funding cuts, program delays and manufacturing difficulties caused
program turbulence.  By 1993, aircraft were being delivered late and costs were high.  The program was in trouble and
on the brink of cancellation.
 <P>  The Air Force, DoD and Congress agreed to give the contractor time to improve performance and in the meantime
capped the initial buy at 40 aircraft.  Since then, McDonnell Douglas has made significant progress.  Today we have 22
aircraft and the last 10 deliveries have been ahead of schedule.  We have seen dramatic improvements in quality, costs
are in line and under control.  The C-17 achieved initial operationcapability in January of this year, and since then it
has performed superbly, both in evaluations and during operational missions.  The aircraft holds 22 world records and
this year McDonnell Douglas and the U.S. Air Force received both the Collier Trophy and the Schilling Award in
recognition of recent work that they ve done in the C-17.  
 <P>  In July, we conducted the 30-day reliability, maintainability and availability evaluation of the C-17.  The GAO and
the press watched closely as the C-17 achieved a remarkable 99.2 percent departure reliability rate and averaged nearly
17 flying hours per aircraft per day during a test of wartime utilization rates.  By any measure, the C-17 surpassed our
most optimistic expectations.  As a result, we have tremendous confidence in the performance of this aircraft.  
 <P>  Recently, we used the C-17 in the humanitarian relief mission associated with Hurricane Marilyn.  During the
course of this effort, we were requested to move large trucks and communication vans to St.  Thomas Island.  The
equipment was too large for the C-130 or the C-141.  The taxiways would not handle the C-5.  Had we not had the
C-17, we would have been forced to use sealift, and it would have taken many days to have met the requirement.
 <P>  That is not the total story.  In 1993, When the C-17 was in deep trouble, we were forced to look at other
alternatives.  That review led to the Non-Developmental Airlift Aircraft program or the NDAA.  Two candidates
emerged   the Lockheed C-5D and the Boeing 747-400.  We said w would consider the C-5D if we stopped the C-17
program at 40.  We also said we would look at a mix of C-17s , 747-400s and possibly C-5Ds at a cost effectiveness
trade off.  
 <P>  Let me stop here and say the 747 is a highly capable aircraft.  It has tremendous range and payload capacity and its
sticker price is less than that of the C-17.  It can carry large amounts of bulk cargo and some oversized and outsized
equipment.  On the other hand, it was not designed to operate out of austere airfields, it does not have drive on, drive
off capability, it is not air refuelable and you cannot air drop troops or equipment from it.  Our task in recent months
has been to quantify those various attributes of the various competitors and analyze them for the Defense Acquisition
Board.  The DAB will meet to make a decision on the future of the C-17 program and the NDAA next week.  As you
know, it is chaired by the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and its charter is to determine the appropriate
strategic airlift fleet to meet the nation s defense needs for the 21st century.  I am not going to speculate on that
decision, but I am sure I ll get some questions.
 <P>  I would like to briefly discuss the information we ve gathered and the analysis performed to support that decision. 
In understanding any analysis, one must have a full appreciation for the assumptions.  MRS/BURU, which forms the
baseline for our analysis, has a number of assumptions regarding factors such as warning times, CRAF call up and
Reserve Component activation, all of which have an important impact on the ultimate results of the study.  In gathering
the information that support the DAB decision, our first effort was a Strategic Airlift Force Mix Analysis, which has
become commonly known as SAFMA.  Before I lose you, we have SAFMA, evaluating MRS/BURU requirements. 
Aren't these acronyms great?  Using a Cray computer and a very sophisticated airlift model, which has been blessed by
Institution for Defense Analysis or IDA, and OSD PA&E [Program, Analysis and Evaluation], we ve analyzed various
fleet mixes of C-17s and NDAA to see if they met the MRS/BURU requirement.  We ve then provided these results to
industry for their review.  Next we sat down with industry and negotiated ready to sign contracts for the C-17 and
NDAA.  We then used the cost data from those cost contracts to computer 25 year life-cycle costs which were provided
by the Air Force Cost Analysis Investment Group, AFCAIG, and validated by the OSD CAIG.  Finally, we did
sensitivity analysis on the results based upon the assumptions I mentioned earlier.  As a result, we have been able to
provide the DAB a very good feel for the requirements and costs associated with the MRS/BURU requirement.  But
MRS/BURU is not the total story.
  <P>  It does not address the unique military airlift requirements involved in lesser regional contingencies, smaller
military operations, humanitarian relief, strategic brigade airdrop, special operations and intra theater lift.  An OSD
team has led a study to capture the factors necessary to determine the right mix to meet these requirements.  Also, DoD
conducted a utilization rate analysis which examined the inherent capability ofthe C-17 and the NDAA competitors to
meet target utilization rates, that is, flight hours per aircraft per day, which ultimately translates to through-put
capacity.  
 <P>  The studies and analyses I have just mentioned have taken many months to complete.  This information, along with
the DT&E reports, the OT&E reports, the contracor costs and performance data and results from the RM&A
evaluations will all be available to the DAB.  As someone recently said, the weight of the paperwork finally equals the
weight of the airplane, so it must be time to make a decision and get on with the program.  I would only add that after
14 years, it is about time.
 <P>  Now let me wrap this up with some final thoughts.  The transportation needs of this nation are framed by our
commitment to remain engaged in events throughout the world.  Our future requirements have been defined through
studies and analysis.  To meet these requirements, we have a diverse transportation system utilizing sealift,
prepositioning and air mobility.  In a few days, we will make a major decision on the airlift portion of that system. 
Think back to the way I started this presentation by talking about 1988 and what we saw in 1990 and 1991.  How many
of your are willing to predict the exact force structure that we are going to need in 2010, 2020 or beyond 2020,
remembering that the airlift force that we are about to select will take us well beyond that year 2020? 
 <P>  The studies and analyses we use today provide the best tools for us to express our assumptions and plans for the
future.  They are a good starting part for planning, but I want all of you to remember that the forces we acquire today
will be serving this nation far into the future.  Flexibility is hard to quantify and model.  Yet, it is essential if we are to
maintain our ability to protect America s interests around the world.  New challenges in a different world will face the
generations that follow us.  We must provide them with the tools that are flexible and adaptable if we expect them to
keep this nation free in the future.
<P>   Thanks very much, I'll take your questions.
<P> 
  <I>GENERAL SHAUD:</I>  Skip, we have some questions for you as predicted.  The first question deals with you being
CINCTRANS and the Air Mobility Command, Military Traffic Management Command and Military Sealift Command. 
It sounds as though there is one military command and the others are primarily civilian commands.  How does all that
work?
<P>   <I>GENERAL RUTHERFORD:</I>  Sometimes it works extremely well.  In the transportation business, we are highly
dependent upon the civilian sector to get our job done.  We have a reasonable amount of organic airlift capability.  A
major portion of our airlift capability exists on the Guard and Reserve side and in the CRAF.  The CRAF represents, as
I mentioned earlier, more than one third of our total cargo capability and almost 90 percent of our passenger capability,
and is heavily dependent upon civilians.
<P>   Over on the sealift side of the house, we are building an organic surge sealift capability, as I tried to address earlier. 
But today, we are largely dependent upon civil hulls to meet our needs.  On the ground transportation side of the house,
almost 95 percent of our capability exists on the civil side.  Given so much of this capability exists in the civil sector, it
is pretty obvious you are going to have people deal with those contractors on a day-to-day basis.  To a large degree,
MTMC and MSC are largely contract operations.  They have a large number of reservists that are committed to them
during wartime to open ports and load ships, but on a day-to-day basis it is largely a contract operation.  
<P>   So more than I would like to, when a major contingency breaks out, I turn to the contracting officer and say,
"Would you please get me some force structure so I can fight the war."  We have orchestrated that very well, but this
nation cannot afford the dollars required to go out and buy an organic capability which we need to do the job.  So,
we ve got the best of all worlds here, and we are working it very well.  I am pleased with the arrangement the way it is.
<P>   <I>GENERAL SHAUD: </I> Has the transfer of the C-130s left any disconnects or another complications in the airlift
system? 
<P>   <I>GENERAL RUTHERFORD:</I>  There were complications before we changed the MAJCOM managing the
assignment of the C-130s.  The system is working very well.  Primarily, the C-130s were operating intra-theater while
we were operating inter-theater.  There is a point out there where they must come together.  That point is at the AOR
[Area of Responsibility], and those air fields.  Who is going to land on those air fields?  I ve got 1,100 airplanes
available to me to support a contingency around the world.  There is not an airfield in Southwest Asia or in Korea that
can handle 1,100 airplanes.  It can t begin to handle that many lift airplanes of that size.  We in the theater strategic lift
business and in the intra-theater lift business have got to talk about how we are going to use those airfields.  And we ve
got to talk to the people in theater about how they are going to operate off those airfields with their fighters.  It is a very
critical issue.  
<P>   We have worked out good arrangements to work those issues.  What we will do is end up with an individual in
theater working with the in theater air component commander to figure out how we mesh that together.  I don t see any
problem with it the way it is working today.
 <P>  <I>GENERAL SHAUD: </I> The next question has to do with this NDAA, C-33 (747-400).  Is the Non-Development
Airlift Aircraft program intended in any way to compete with the CRAF?
 <P>  <I>GENERAL RUTHERFORD:</I> Do you mean is there any friction there between the two?  I don t think so.  As I
said, the CRAF is the first thing I addressed when talking about air mobility.  The CRAF is very important to us.  I
don t want to go buy those 260 airplanes.  We need to protect the business base  we have for the CRAF arriers.  That is
what draws them into the program and keeps them in the program.  As long as I can maintain a level of business that is
attractive, like it is today, then I will be able to keep the CRAF program healthy, regardless of whether I have NDAA
or C-17s.  
  <P> Having said that, as soon as we end up with these civilian airplanes in the organic fleet, we are going to get
criticism.  Go back and look at the history of the establishment of the NDAA and the organic MAC fleet.  Back in the
1950s, they were talking about this same issue.  There will obviously be perceptions that we are stealing business from
the CRAF, but I don t see it that way.  I see us segmenting a portion of the market and devoting it to CRAF.
 <P>  <I>GENERAL SHAUD:</I>  Skip, I have to ask you a personnel question.  Has the OPTEMPO of personnel deployment
in Air Mobility Command given you a problem with your troops and their quality of life? 
 <P>  <I>GENERAL RUTHERFORD:</I>  In Air Mobility Command, we ve always been on the go.  That is what we do for
our living.  To the extent I ve got people out there pushing air lifters around the world, it is not a major problem. 
Because we ve had situations in Bosnia and Northern and Southern Iraq that we needed to take care of.  
 <P>  There has been a lot of tanker activity.  There are quite a few deployments overseas.  It is our tanker crews who are
pulling high TDY rates and are being impacted by the OPTEMPO, more so than the airlifters.  It is a concern, but we
are down from last year.  We are doing alright there as long as we don t get another big surge.
  <P> <I>GENERAL SHAUD:</I>  We have one last question.  Without prejudging the final decision on the C-17 buy, would
you give us your views on the merits of an all C-17 acquisition versus a mixed fleet of  C-17s and C-33s. 
 <P> <I>GENERAL RUTHERFORD:</I>  I am not going to try to prejudge the DAB [Defense Acquisition Board] next week. 
The C-17 is a good airplane.  It has come a long way.  It offers us a lot of flexibility that we don t see in the 747-400. 
At the same time, the 747-400 is cheaper, hauls a lot and goes a long way.  So, you ve got to consider that.
 <P> Ultimately, you must weigh these things and look at requirements and try to figure out what is best for the American
taxpayer and make your judgement.  Actually, I m glad I don t have to make that decision.  Dr. Kaminski [Paul G.
Kaminski, USD for Acquisition & Technology] will announce the decision the 3rd of November.
<P>  <I>GENERAL SHAUD:</I>  Skip, we thank you very much for being with us.  <P>

<P>
                        <CENTER><B>Air Combat -- Turning a Century</B></CENTER>
<P>
  I want to tell you about your United States Air Force and Air Combat Command and where we are today.
 <P>It was about 50 years ago that the man who most affected the development of the Air Force wrote in his memoirs
that you can t build an Air Force overnight.  You ve got to look 20, 30, 50 years into the future to prepare for the Air
Force s global mission.  And you heard quite a bit about that today from the Chief and from the Secretary.  But we
also, like Hap Arnold, know that you can t build an Air Force overnight, and we know that the choices we make today
will affect our Air Force for 20, 30, and 50 years ahead.  
 <P> Let's talk about some of those choices for a moment.  The last time the Air Force faced a set of choices like we
have now was back in the 1970s when budgets were cut dramatically.  We chose a much different route in the 1970s
than we have chosen today.  The route that we chose in the 70s was to keep every base that we had open.  We would
hang onto every airplane and every squadron that we could.  And the budgets just flat would not support that.  So how
did we get through it?  We cut flying hours, and we cut spare parts.  It was a disastrous set of choices.  
 <P> Those of us who were squadron commanders during the late 70s saw that our pilots were getting 7 to 8 sorties a
month, which was not enough for them to be combat ready.  They knew they were not combat ready.  They got out in
great numbers.  That forced a system of training to replace pilots whom we had spent $6 million getting up to speed in
the F-15, and then they got out and we had to start over again. 
 <P> Our maintenance people, who want nothing more than to fix a broken airplane, would go to the spare parts bin, and
there were no spare parts.  They became demoralized.  Retention was bad.  We had problems all over.  Those of us
who were squadron commanders in the 70s and saw that said, "If we are ever in a position of senior leadership, we will
make a different set of choices.  We will close bases, and we will cut force structure.  But whatever force structure
we ve got, let s provide it with the flying hours and with the spare parts it takes to be truly combat ready.  We would
rather have one squadron where we are truly combat ready, than to have 10 sick ones on the books."  
 <P> As painful as that has been, we have in fact closed over a third of our bases.  We have cut our fighter force structure
from 40 wings to 20 wings.  We ve reduced our bomber force by two-thirds.  Those are significant numbers and not
without pain.  For example, in our force structure arena, it has an impact on our people.  
<P>  I just visited our F-15Es at Seymour Johnson [Air Force Base, N.C.] this past week.  Most people think we brought
our troops home after Desert Storm.  Seymour Johnson and the F-15E is getting ready for their 14th deployment to
Southwest Asia since Desert Storm.  Think about that for a moment.  You have two operational squadrons with 14
deployments in four years.  It is not unreasonable that in 1991 a young crew chief showed up on the line at Seymour
Johnson in the F-15E.  Four years later, he is still there, but on his 14th deployment.  If he is in one of two squadrons,
he may have only deployed 7 times, but that is a tremendous impact on our people.  That story is repeated time and
time again especially in our systems which are small in number and high in demand.
<P>  We are supporting our training very strongly and that is the correct approach to take.  Training is not without
problems in today s Air Force, though.  When you deploy for four months at a time to Incirlik, Turkey, for Operation
Provide Comfort in your F-16, you will go for four months and you will never drop a bomb.  You will never engage in
a simulated air combat engagement because that is not why we are there.  There are all kinds of problems when you are
ready to go to war, when you ve got live missiles on board, and you are not going to train air-to-air in that
configuration, and you are not going to drop bombs.
 <P> The problem is when we bring those F-16s home, three days later they may be called on to support OPLAN 5027
and they may be off to Korea.  We tried to get around some of that by shortening the length of deployments.  You can
go for 60 days and never drop a bomb, come back and in just a couple of sorties get back up to speed.  You do that for
three, four, five six months at a time, it is much more difficult.  But we are working that problem and trying to strike
the balance.  
 <P> I'd like to spend most of the time talking about modernization because I know it is very important to all of  you in
this room.  Again, we are forced with choices within that modernization account.  We have done our modernization in
the Air Force in a cyclical manner for many years because that is the only way we can afford it.  The decade of the 70s
was the decade of fighter modernization.  That is when we brought on board the F-15, the F-16, and the A-10.  The
decade of the 80's was strategic modernization   MX missile, small ICBM, rail garrison, B-1, B-2, and B-52 upgrades. 
The decade of the 90's is our mobility modernization   C-17s and C-130Js.
<P>  By the time we turn the century, we will be back in the fighter modernization cycle again.  It will be time to replace
the F-15s and the F-16s that are serving us extremely well and have served us extremely well.   We think of the F-15 as
our most modern fighter, but I went to the first flight of the fist F-15 as a captain at Langley Air Force Base [Va.] in
1972.  That was 23 years ago.  
 <P> Today we are still 10 years away from the first combat F-22 replacement.  That is 33 years that we have been flying
that airplane.  That is not 33 years since the technology was frozen or since the design was frozen, it is 33 that it has
been airborne.  You have to go back years beyond that from when we froze the technology for the F-15.  
 <P> Our F-16 is almost the same story.  We first flew the F-16 in 1974.  That was 21 years ago.  Today, we are at least
15 years away from the first combat replacement for the F-16 in the year 2010, the JAST [Joint Advanced Strike
Technology] program.  JAST is terribly important to us because the bulk of our force is with F-16 aircraft, and we are
working that hard from a requirements point of view.  I would like to report to you that we are making progress in that
regard.  
 <P> We are working with the Marines and with the Navy.  I can tell you that we are in very good shape with regard to
the Marines in terms of harmonizing our requirements.  What the Marines need in terms of range, payload,
maneuverability, signature, and cost is identical to what the Air Force needs.  We still have work to do with the Navy,
because the Navy has a different set of requirements they are looking at.  We have to continue to work that hard.
  <P>Let s talk about our bombers for a moment.  The B-52 is  certainly our workhorse today.  As we turn the century,
we will continue to use the B-52 in both a nuclear and conventional role.  What we really need most of all on the B-52
is precision guided ordnance.  That is true across our bomber force.  But we really need that, and we are working on it.
 <P> The B-1 should be the backbone of our bomber fleet.  With 95 airplanes today, after the turn of the century we will
have about 62 of those in the force structure.  We will be shifting from a low altitude nuclear penetrator to a medium
and high altitude conventional bomber.  But again, the most burning need we have is for precision attack capability on
the B-1.  We also need to do some work on the B-1s electronic counter measure system.  There is a plan to do that, and
we've got dollars in the budget to do that.
 <P> For the precision attack that I mentioned for the B-52 and the B-1 and also for the B-2, we need JDAM [Joint Direct
Attack Munition].  We also need the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff missile, JSOW, and we need the wind corrected
munitions dispenser and have them qualified for the fleet.  The JDAM story that you ve heard about today is a very
good news story for our Air Force.  This is one of the few times when we are getting a weapons system that is being
accelerated into the inventory, as opposed to slipped.  The cost has come in cheaper instead of more expensive.  
 <P> We have shifted our first JDAM platform to the B-52, and we should have a capability on the B-52 in the 1997 time
period, which is a good acceleration of the program.  
 <P> With regard to the B-2, we still have an awful lot of work.  We have over $1.5 billion in development yet to go on
the B-2.  We currently have the Block 10 aircraft, which are serving us well in terms of training pilots and training
maintenance crews.  It will be next summer before we get the first Block 20.  It will be near the end of the century
before we get the Block 30 that should approach what we need in terms of radar signature.  We haven t built one yet,
so we have to do that and test it.  So there is still a lot of work yet to go, but in any case, precision attack capability on
our B-2 will be as critically important as it is on the B-52 and the B-1.
 <P> There has been a lot of turmoil in the electronic warfare community.  We are retiring the F-4G this year.  It is a
system that has served us well, but we have to divest ourselves of those older systems that are expensive to maintain,
operate and are less capable than what they should be.  In the case of the F-4G, it has been replaced with the Block 50
F-16 HARM [High-speed Anti-radiation Missile] targeting aircraft, that has tremendous capabilities over the F-4.  It
has longer range, more loiter, greater maneuverability, greater self protection capability with the AMRAAM
[Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile] missile, and greater sensitivity with the HARM targeting system.  The
field of view is not a full 360 degrees as in the F-4G Wild Weasel, but we can work around that with tactics.  With
regard to numbers, we have 72 HARM targeting systems in the inventory versus only 36 Wild Weasels, so we have a
tremendous increase in capability.  
 <P> The EF-111/EA-6B debate is worthwhile to talk about for a couple of minutes because I have been a supporter of
retiring the EF-111.  Let me tell you what led me to that conclusion.  We have 24 EF-111s in our inventory.  In order to
get these to the turn of the century, it was going to cost us $1.5 billion because we have to maintain the depot system
and all the things that go with a unique set of 24 airplanes.  The jamming system is an old 1974 system.  We haven t
upgraded it.  We have tried and failed.  The Navy has 127 of the EA-6B versus 24 EF-111s.  If you are going to try to
maintain a jamming capability, why not do it on a viable fleet size aircraft?  
 <P> Next, most people think the EA-6B is an old airplane.  With regard to age, the EF-111 is 30 years old.  The average
age of the EA-6B is less than 12 years.  It is a much newer airframe.  How about its effectiveness?  This is an argument
that has gone on for at least the 20 years that I ve been around this business.  If you happen to be an EF-111 guy, you
will march in with a stack of studies that prove conclusively the EF-111 is the best jammer in the world.  If  you
happen to be an EA-6B guy, you will walk in with a stack of studies that prove conclusively the EA-6B is best.  The
analysts failed time and time again to ever sort that out.  
  <P>I took a farmer approach.  I went out to the desert where we ve got people who operate simulated threat systems that
have to work against the EF-111 and the EA-6B every day.  I asked the radar operators, "Which of these airplanes
gives you the hardest time when you are trying to do your job?"  They said, "General, you are not going to like the
answer to this, but the EA-6B gives us a harder time than the EF-111."  I said, "That is okay with me, I m just trying to
find ground truth here."  If you put all those things together, my belief is the EA-6B is the right way to go.  That is the
approach we have taken.  Last month, I went to Whidbey Island [NAS, Wash.] along with the Vice CNO, and we stood
up the first squadron that will be a joint squadron.  We have assigned Air Force EWOs [Electronic Warfare Officer]
and pilots to that squadron.  They are onboard and in training.  I believe with a lot of work that we will be in good
shape in that mission area.  
 <P> Let's talk about combat support for a moment.  Joint STARS is a treendous system with tremendous capability and
one that we really need to get on with.  The only downside  of Joint STARS is we signed the contract in 1985.  It even
served an extremely successful deployment in Desert Storm five years ago.  But ten years after signing a contract, we
are still screwing around testing it to satisfy all the testers in the Pentagon, and we are still two years away from getting
IOC [Initial Operational Capability].  Nevertheless, we stood up the Joint STARS squadron this month.  We will have
the wing up and operating in January.  We ve picked the senior leadership for those positions, and we are anxiously
awaiting getting on with the Joint STARS aircraft.
 <P> AWACS is absolutely indispensable to our operations and to the CINCs around the world.  We have a small
number of airplanes, but they are in great demand.  All the CINCs want them all the time.  To give you an idea of how
much AWACS is in demand, we started flying AWACS 24 hours a day, 7 days a week over Saudi Arabia in 1979.  We
did that for 10 straight years.  In 1989, we brought them home.  What happened in August of 1990?  They went back
and they ve been there ever since.  If you have been in the AWACS community for the last 16 years, except for about a
six month period in late 89 and early 90, all you have known is 200 days a year away from your family.  
  <P>We have all gone on remote tours.  We have all gone on long TDYs, but how many of you have been asked to do it
16 years in a row?  We have to get the system under control and we are doing that.  We have gone to the Joint Staff
and to the CINCs and said, "Enough, we can t do that."  We ve brought AWACS home.  We are training new crews
and trying to get the program stabilized.  By December, we will have enough crews trained and on board to get our
perstempo down to less than 120 days a year.  There is good progress in that regard.  
 <P> We must do some more modernization on AWACS.  The RSIP, the Radar System Improvement Program, is
coming along well, and we are anxiously waiting for it.  We are getting our Block 30/35 upgrades, which will be
terribly important for us.  That will give us GPS, JTIDS [Joint Tactical Information Distribution System] class 2, ESM
on board, and new computers.  One of the things that is terribly deficient in the AWACS is that we are still using
"steam-driven" computer from the 1960s.  It is absolutely criminal when we take our young men and young women
who go to their desk tops using  Windows 95, and then we put them on board AWACS and they use a system that is
older than many people in this room.  We ve got to do better than that, we really do.  There is no reason for it.  
 <P> People have talked about UAVs [Unmanned Aerial Vehicles].  We stood up the 11th Reconnaissance Squadron in
July at Nellis [AFB, Nev.].  They have been sending their people to the Bosnia theater and watching what is going on
there.  We are anxiously awaiting our first Predators as we learn how to use UAVs.  I am convinced that we have
enormous potential in UAVs.  I am also convinced that we have significant challenges in integrating UAVs into our
force structure.  The only way to find out how to do that is to stand up a squadron and go try it.  That s what we are
doing.
  <P>The Secretary has talked to you about information warfare.  The squadron stood up on the first of Octoer.  We have
a commander, people assigned, and they will continue to build throughout the rest of this year.  They will do much the
same thing in information warfare as we talked about in UAVs.
 <P> We just accepted the first C-130J for the U.S. Air Force.  For those of you not familiar with the C-130J, it is a
tremendous improvement in the aircraft.  If you go into the cockpit of a C-130H model, it looks just like the C-130A
did.  There hadn t been improvement in 40 years.  The C-130J has a fully "glass" cockpit, fly by wire throttles, and a
very modernized system.  You would be very proud of it.  It is much more efficient, has much higher altitude, much
better fuel economy, and much better speed.  We will be buying the C-130J in relatively small numbers for awhile, and
so one of the things we will probably do is take the first ones and upgrade that portion of our fleet that is small in
number but in high demand    ABCCC, Coronet Solo, and Compass Call.  We are looking to see if it makes sense to
take the J model and use it for these missions.  For example with  ABCCC, it will give much more loiter, higher
altitude and a more modern system for flying that very critical mission.  
 <P> As we mentioned, we don t build an Air Force overnight.  These are some of the choices, though, that we have
made in striking a balance between force structure, training and modernization.  As the Chief talked about today, I
believe we have a program, and we have worked out our modernization plans for the next 25 years.  If you tell me what
the budget is going to be, then we can tell you what we are going to do.  If you cut it 20 percent, then let me tell you
what that means and what we will have to defer.  If you stay on projection, this is what we would do.  If there is a
slight increase, this is where we would put the additional dollar.  Those plans have been laid in.  We look forward to
working with John Gordon as he does the long range planning for the Air Force.  
 <P> That is all I have for you right now.  I d like to entertain any questions you may have.
<P>
  <I>GENERAL SHAUD:</I>  Joe, we do have a couple of questions.  On the subject of JAST, what are the major
differences between Navy and Air Force requirements?
 <P> <I>GENERAL RALSTON:</I>  Range is the major difference.  The Navy wants greater range and greater pay load. 
Unfortunately, when you want greater range and greater payload, it normally means a bigger airplane.  A bigger
airplane means a more expensive airplane.  We can t afford to buy it in the numbers that we need   thousands   to
replace our F-16s.
<P>  <I>GENERAL SHAUD:</I>  The Air Force is looking at another generation of manned tactical reconnaissance aircraft. 
Per your remarks, the Air Force appears to be solidly behind UAVs.  How does the timing of the deployment of these
systems relate to one another and are manned and unmanned RECCE systems complimentary or duplicative?
<P>  <I>GENERAL RALSTON:</I>  Let me take the timing question first.  We have retired our RF-4Cs.  As we retired the
RF-4Cs, we brought on board the first of a series of podded systems for our F-16s.   For example, the Richmond Guard
today has four podded systems, EO [electro-optical] systems with a digital backplate on the camera so they can data
link the pictures to a ground station.  That is a capability today.  If we need to deploy it, we have it.  
  <P>Now we must look at what we do in addition to that.  How much is enough?  How much do you need for an MRC
[Major Regional Contingency] and how much can you swing?  Or do you need more for two MRCs?  The studies have
been done, and we are working on that now.  We will go to the Chief with that issue over the next week or so.  With
regard to UAVs,  we stood up the squadron.  I think the technology is there for UAVs.  It certainly makes sense to do
that where we can.  We must get smart on it and learn how to do it.  I don t believe that there is anyone today prepared
to do away with manned RECCE based on the promise of UAVs.  We ve got to wait and see how it develops.  So it
will be a complimentary arrangement for the foreseeable future.  Once you go beyond that, I don t know.  Other people
will be around to make that decision.
  <P><I>GENERAL SHAUD:</I>  Joe, here is a question on air-to-air missiles.  Would you discuss the progress in the
AIM-9X program, the timeline and will it finally give us parity with the Russian AA-11?
<P>  <I>GENERAL RALSTON: </I> One of our really burning needs in the air-to-air and air superiority arena is for a better
short-range missile.  We are currently third or fourth in the world in short-range, air-to-air missile capability.  That
doesn t make me feel very good for the United States of America and for our men and women who are flying in
combat.  It has been a very difficult program.  We started in 1980 to upgrade the AIM-9 with ASRAAM.  It finally
failed about 1990.  Here we are starting over again.  On the requirements side, I feel very good.  Because we have
worked very well with the Navy on the requirements for a very good short-range air-to-air missile, the AIM-9X
program.  How it gets implemented in execution and all of the things that go with that, I don t know.  It is too early to
tell.  I certainly know that we have the technical capability to do it.  It is not a money problem.  There are other
legitimate issues, but nevertheless issues, that will work to slow the program down.  I am concerned about that aspect
of it.
 <P> <I>GENERAL SHAUD:</I>  The next question is on sustaining the F-15/F-16 force.  We have sustainment buys for these
aircraft and are these going to depend on JAST timing?
<P> <I> GENERAL RALSTON: </I> Yes, and let me talk about that for a moment.  We can take our current force structure
that we ve got, 20 fighter wing equivalents, and we can apply our expected attrition numbers to that.  If you tell me
how many years I need to fly the F-16 fleet until JAST comes on board, I can tell you how many airplanes we ar going
to crash.  I can tell you how many are in attrition reserve today.  When you compare the two and if you talk of 2010 for
the first combat JAST coming on board, we are 120 airplanes short of maintaining our force structure.  
 <P> There are some options.  You can buy 120 more F-16s.  You can reduce the force structure.  You can convert some
F-15Cs to multi-role as the F-22 comes on board.  Or you can go back and SLEP [Service Life Enhancement Program]
some F-16s out of the bone yard.  I don t know exactly what the right solution to that is.  Those are things that we will
go through.  We have a CAF commanders conference coming up Monday and Tuesday where General Lorber [Gen.
John G. Lorber, PACAF], General Hawley [Gen. Richard E.Hawley, USAFE], General Boles [Gen. Billy J. Boles,
AETC], General Ashy [Gen. Joseph W. Ashy, AFSPC] and I will walk through that particular problem.  We ll try to
come up with some recommendations. 
 <P> <I>GENERAL SHAUD:</I>  This is a forecast question.  How do you see the F-22 faring in Congress next year when it
moves from R&D to production?
 <P> <I>GENERAL RALSTON: </I> I would certainly be optimistic and hope that we will do well.  Let me talk to you for a
moment about something that I didn't put in my speech.  I want to use it as an illustration of the absolute need for
acquisition reform.  In 1977, I was called one day and told that I had just disappeared off the manning document.  I
didn't exist and was to report down the hall.  I got down the hall and there were five people.  We were given the job by
then Under Secretary of Defense Bill Perry to field the F-117.  It was a very small program office of five people.  We
signed the contract for the airplane in October 1978.  Just a little over four years later, we had combat capable F-117s
in the Tactical Air Command s inventory.  
 <P> I contrast that with the F-22, where we signed the contract for the F-22 in 1986.  Here we are nine years later.  We
are almost two years away from the first flight on the first test airplane, and we are 10 years away from the first combat
airplane being added to the force.  Something is wrong with that picture.  Four years versus 19 years.  The only
difference was not in technology, for the F-117 was a greater leap in technology from what existed in the 70s than what
the F-22 is today in the 90s.  It was not a matter of dollars.  It was a matter of the acquisition rules upon which the
program was run.  
 <P> That is the most compelling argument I can give you for acquisition reform and why we need it.  I believe we are in
the best position we have ever been with Secretary Perry [William J. Perry, Secretary of Defense], with Dr. Kaminski
[Paul G. Kaminski, USD for Acquisition & Technology] and Ms. Druyun [Darleen Druyun, SAF/AQ (Acting)].  They
understand the problem very well, and they are working it well.  We need to get behind them and support their efforts
for meaningful acquisition reform.       
 <P> <I>GENERAL SHAUD:</I>  Joe, here is a last question.  Earlier estimates of the requirements for force structure are for
180 operational bombers and it seems we are short of that now.   Are you satisfied with the size of the bomber fleet?  
 <P><I>GENERAL RALSTON:</I>  We said about 180 bombers were needed.  Under our current plan, we will have 181
bombers   66 B-52s, 95 B-1s and 20 B-2s.  What is needed is about 100 deployable bombers.  When we field the
force I just talked about of 44 deployable B-52s, 70 combat-coded, deployable B-1s and 16 deployable B-2s, we will
have about 130 airplanes deployable.  We have used that force structure in our simulations, our modeling, our analysis
and the NIMBLE DANCER joint exercises and in the DoD heavy bomber study.  They all conclude you can do the job
given that force structure.  
 <P> The real issue is the question, "Would we like to have more bombers."  Sure, we d like to have more bombers,
more fighters, more AWACS, more Joint STARS, and more everything.  But given the priorities that we have and
where we see the budget going, can we afford out of Air Combat Command to trade off force structure, flying hours,
and modernization to the tune of $30 billion for additional B-2s? The answer is no.
 <P> <I>GENERAL SHAUD:</I>  Joe, thanks for being with us.
 <P> As a reminder to you, the next AFA event will be the Air Warfare Symposium at Orlando on the 15th and 16th of
February 1996.  Let me just thank all the participants and our entire audience for being with us all day.  It has been
certainly a valuable day.  On behalf of Walt Scott, Tom McKee, Jim McCoy and Gene Smith,  thanks for being here.

<H4>INTRODUCTION</H4>
<P>
"The first day of the Information Age was that day when our dependence upon computers and
communications systems and high-tech gadgetry exceeded our ability to live without them."1
The Air Force has been in the information age for many years.  The military certainly cannot
function without the computer and communications systems that support information processing
requirements at tactical through strategic levels of the air, land, sea, and space forces. 
Information provides a significant advantage over any potential adversary.  Recently, a
widespread realization of this fact has created a new focus in the area called information warfare. 
<P>  
This paper explores one aspect of information warfare--an aspect that does not gain the front
page attention given to hackers, viruses, the Internet, and other high technology dangers or
targets. The focus of this paper is the requirement to glean decision-making information from the
glut of data available to today's combat commander in a timely manner.  This information is
needed to support near-term planning and decision making.  This capability directly impacts
many vital combat and combat support functions.  For example, building the Air Tasking Order
requires a large data synthesis effort to support this time-sensitive, decision-making function.  
When explaining information warfare, Major General Kenneth A. Minihan, Air Force Assistant
Chief of Staff for Intelligence, talks about information dominance.  In an interview with the
Journal of Electronic Defense, General Minihan defined information dominance with a series of
statements on what information dominance is and is not.  The following are a few of the 'is'
statements: 2
<P>"It is a way of increasing our capabilities by using that information to make right decisions, and
applying them faster than the enemy can." 
<P>"It is a method of using all information at our disposal to predict (and affect) what happens
tomorrow, before the enemy even jumps out of bed and thinks about what to do today."  
<P> "Most of all, information dominance is a mindset.  It is the attitude needed to make ourselves a
powerful weapon on the battlefields of the 21st century."
Before proceeding further, it is helpful to understand the impetus for this research and resulting
paper.  The Air Force has always been interested in developing or uncovering new technologies
to improve its war fighting capability and to understand the capabilities of other militaries.  One
particular area that has been studied for many years is the Russian use of cybernetics and
situational control.  In particular, the National Air Intelligence Center, in cooperation with the
Defense Intelligence Agency, has shown interest in this area.  A full understanding of what the
Russians have accomplished in cybernetics, from both a theoretical and practical perspective, has
not been well understood.  With the break up of the Soviet Union, there has been increased
access to the Russian people and their ideas.  Thus, now is the time to determine through more
interaction and study, whether the Russians have, indeed, developed unique techniques or
technologies which may be employed in military applications to improve information warfare
capabilities.    
<P>While Russia has made great strides towards democracy and an open society, no one can predict
with certainty the future of Russia and the other countries that made up the Soviet Union.  Now
is the time to take advantage to learn more from the Russians.  This window of opportunity may
not always be open.
<P>Cybernetics, the concept of feedback control, is not well understood by many people.  The 'cyber'
part of the word is now being used as a prefix with many words--cyberspace, cyberwar,
cybersphere, and others--to connote a link to computers and high technology.  However, the
original concept of cybernetics--information feedback for control--goes well beyond the
application of computer systems.  Cybernetics provides a conceptual framework to maximize the
use of information in warfare--it provides part of the "mindset" that General Minihan mentioned. 
This paper reviews the field of cybernetics and explores the usefulness of cybernetics as a model
to improve information utilization for military decision making.  It reviews Russian work to
develop and apply the concepts of cybernetics in situational control.
<P>However, the original concept of cybernetics--information feedback for control--goes well
beyond the application of computer systems.
While cybernetics offers a framework for designing and operating feedback control systems,
tools and techniques are required to enable systems to improve feedback and its analysis in the
decision making process.  The Russians have attempted to do this through situational control. 
This paper reviews the Russian field of situational control and the application of semiotic
modeling to improve feedback in cybernetic control systems.  If situational control improves
feedback control, the same techniques could be used to improve the information flow to combat
commanders.

<H4>THE AIR COMMANDER'S PROBLEM</H4>

Today's military commander faces an extremely complex environment.  Complexity is the result
of many factors: vast changes in the world's political environment over the recent past, declining
resources, ever increasing implementation of high technology to conduct warfare, vast amounts
of data available to help in the decision process, and others.
<P>Combat can be viewed as a complex adaptive process.  An adaptive system uses its resources to
adapt to disturbances from the internal and external environment to survive and reach its goals. 
Complex adaptive systems can be categorized as stationary or non-stationary.  Stationary
systems are those in which variables change in time, but the function relating them is constant. 
They can be represented by quantitative models through the use of differential equations and
other mathematical modeling techniques.  The solar system is a stationary system.  The
relationships and movements of bodies in space can be predicted with the laws of orbital
mechanics (Newton's Laws).  The functions that define these movements do not change with
time.  On the other hand, in non-stationary systems both the variables and the functions that
describe the relationships between them change with time.  It is impossible to use traditional
mathematical or operations research models to explain or model non-stationary systems. 
"Systems with human components, such as military organizations, are non-stationary, and
axiomatic models cannot be used to predict their behavior."3
<P>Combat is a non-stationary, adaptive process.  Military organizations are goal seeking--the goal
being to defeat the enemy or satisfy the particular mission requirements at hand.  A combat
commander must employ the resources at his disposal to reach mission goals while responding to
disturbances caused by the enemy  or other sources.  While some subsystems of combat are
stationary, the complexity of combat cannot be represented by algorithms.
<P>So how does a commander deal with this complexity and uncertainty, the fog of war, and make
the timely, accurate decisions required to accomplish his mission?  One method is to use models
to generate the information he needs.
<P>

<B>Military Planning/Execution Model</B><BR>
Figure 1
<P>
The model shown in Figure 1 has been used by military planners and operators in some form or
another over the ages.  The model outlines the four basic steps to military planning and
execution.  The following description of these four steps comes from Sound Military Decision
written at the Naval War College in 1942. 4 
<OL><LI>The selection of its correct military objectives, the ends toward which its action is to be
    directed under varying circumstances; (This step is depicted as the first two blocks in Figure 1.)
    <LI>Planning the detailed operations required;
    <LI>Transmitting the intent so clearly as to ensure inauguration of well coordinated action;
    <LI>The effective supervision of such action.</OL>
<P>These four basic steps remain valid today and are not likely to change.  Step 4, the supervision of
the planned action, is particularly important as the pace of combat increases.  This military
planning and execution model represents the complex system in which a commander makes
choices.  The major differences faced by today's commander compared to commanders of the
past are the data glut and the time constraints that influence each step of this decision making
model.
<P>
<B>The Data Glut</B>
<P>
The data problem can be viewed from three perspectives:  the immense amount of data, the
different sources of data, and the need to assimilate these data in a timely manner.  In other
words, how does a commander exploit data to improve his decision making--what can be done to
provide the right information in the right form?
<P>
<B>Amount of Data</B>
<P>An extraordinarily large amount of data are required to understand all facets of society--from business to the
military.  According to Schwartau in Information Warfare: Chaos on the Electronic
Superhighway, "Estimates are that the data storage requirements of a large corporation will soon
exceed one petabyte or one billion gigabytes." 5  If a large corporation's requirement is that
staggering, imagine the amount of data required to control an air component or joint task force
composed of several nations and military services--similar to the coalition established in Desert
Storm.
<P>Information or knowledge is the distilled version of the pertinent part of that data in a form that
helps a decision maker choose among alternative courses of action.
<P> "As was obvious in the Iraqi conflict, we now live in the age of the electronic battlefield.  Less
obvious to many was the fact that we also live in an age where conflict of any kind creates a
desperate need for huge volumes of information.  The modern battlefield commander requires
information as never before, and not just about enemy numbers, location, movements, readiness,
weapons capabilities, control structures or awareness of friendly actions, but also about his own
forces and allies."  6  In writing about the computer and communications requirements of Desert
Storm in The First Information War, Alan Campen explained that every aspect of the war was
automated.  By the end of Desert Storm there were more than 3,000 computers in the war zone
linked to systems in the United States. 7
<P>
<B>Types of Data</B>
<P>
The commander and his staff are not only faced with huge amounts of data and information, they
are also faced with many different types and sources of data and information. It is important to
make a clear distinction between data and information or knowledge.  Data are the raw,
unassimilated inputs from sensors, open sources, management information systems, and others. 
Information or knowledge is the distilled version of the pertinent part of that data in a form that
helps a decision maker choose among alternative courses of action.  Data are captured and
produced by all the support functions such as logistics, personnel, readiness, intelligence,
maintenance, etc.  These data are collected and processed on many different automated systems,
like the 3,000 computers mentioned above--this presents an extremely complex integration
requirement that has been tackled many times in the past.
<P>The intelligence support function provides one example of the increases in types of data required
in modern conflict.  Intelligence already produces vast amounts of data from the various INTs
(human intelligence, signal intelligence, communications intelligence, and others) to provide
critical input to the commander's decision process.  The tasks of understanding what information
is required and collecting that information is much more difficult since the end of the cold war. 
During the cold war, the who and what of the enemy was more defined.  Now, with the major
changes that have occurred in the world political environment, there is much more uncertainty
with which to deal.  One of the results of this change is the increasing reliance on open sources.  
"Unclassified open source information has been shown to be a substitute for and a complement to
more expensive, or unavailable, classified intelligence." 8  According to Alvin and Heidi Toffler
in War and Anti-War, new types of information are required to cope in the new world
environment.  For example, "Fighting terrorism, in particular, requires extremely fine-grained
information and new, computerized techniques for getting it."  9
<P>The intelligence community faces the ever increasing problem of data fusion with larger amounts
of data and new sources and types of data.  "The biggest challenge to the intelligence community
is the processing of vast amounts of data, filtering, storing, and manipulating it." 10 Although
intelligence provides a vital part of the information required by commanders to make decisions,
it is just part of the picture.  The data fusion problem that must be tackled by the commander and
his staff, with inputs, in the Desert Storm example, from 3000 computers processing all his
operational and support functions, is huge.  The problem will continue to grow with new sources
and new types of data.  The Tofflers predict new ways that data will be collected.  For example,
they talk of the day when  "fleets of low altitude robots the size and shape of model planes" will
send back sensor data. 11
<P>
<B>Timeliness</B>
<P>
The third ingredient of the commander's decision making challenge is the need for timeliness in
the face of these vast amounts and types of information and rapid change in the situation.  This is
best illustrated by a model developed by Colonel John Boyd called the OODA Loop.  OODA
stands for Observe, Orient, Decide and Act.  Figure 2 depicts the OODA loop.  The point of this
diagram is that success in conflict goes to the side who can get inside the opponent's decision
loop.  The OODA loop was originated to describe the actions of a pilot in a tactical environment. 
However, the principle is basic to decisions at any level: tactical, operational, or strategic--a
decision maker must be able to observe and orient (assimilate data) quickly enough to make
good, timely decisions.  The decision maker must maintain this capability as a continuous
process.
<P> 
The intelligence community faces the ever increasing problem of data fusion with larger amounts
of data and new sources and types of data.

<B>Analysis</B>
<P>"Knowledge, in short,  is now the central resource of destructivity, just as it is the central
resource of productivity. . . .  Nor was there ever a time when knowledge was unimportant in
war.  Nevertheless, a revolution is occurring that places knowledge, in various forms, at the core
of military power." 12
<P>The above quotation from War and Anti-War conveys the importance of information in waging
war.  A major part of the commander's challenge to make timely decisions is really a challenge of
extracting knowledge or information from the glut of data.
<P>There has always been a strong focus on collecting and disseminating data.  However, the
processing or analysis function that culls and transforms the relevant data from the mass
available and turns relevant data into information has not received equal focus or support.  This
conclusion has been reached by many who follow the defense community.  The following quotes
are examples:
<P>"Modern computer and sensor technology has been focused on acquisition of data--not its
synthesis for decision makers. 13
<P>"The ability to employ multiple sensors is only a result of improvements in physical
technologies; without a corresponding improvement in the ability to effectively process the
combined sensor data, no gain in information will result."14
<P>"The under exploitation of information technology includes long neglect of analysis vs.
collection; shortage of analytical process modeling; limited application of computer based
analytic methods..."15
<P>Military activity occurs at four levels: political, strategic, operational, and tactical.16 Decision
making at each of these levels is different--subject to many different influences and factors. 
There is great potential for payback from improvements in turning data into information at the
operational/ campaign level.  The focus of the recommendations in this paper is on the
operational/campaign level for the following reasons.  Improvements would benefit the CINC or
Air Component Commander by helping him deal with the high degree of complexity.  At the
tactical level, an Air Force fighter pilot has a wide range of tools at his disposal to react to threats
quickly and keep his decision or OODA loop shorter than the enemy.  Highly advanced avionics
with heads up displays and other technologies feed information to him on the immediate threat. 
Much care is taken to provide the right amount of information so as not to overload the pilot's
ability to process the information; the goal is to provide just what is needed.  In addition to the
numerous systems supporting a pilot, much of the pilot's ability to react comes from expert
training developed through years of flying.  Thus, a large part of his reaction to a particular
situation is driven by the pilot's intuition developed through training and experience.
At the strategic and political levels, decision making is extremely complex and, by necessity, the
models used are the decision maker's mental models. Aside from the tremendous amount of
information that defines the strategic and political environment there are many influences that
muddy the decision making process even further.  At these levels the decision maker is faced
with political, economic, religious, and many other influences that increase the complexity to
extremes.  However, at the operational level the most critical component is a total grasp of the
operational situation--"situational awareness."  This could also be defined as the summing up of
what's going on at the tactical level. 17
<P>The flow of information in the decision making process at the operational/campaign level must
be improved.  The operational level is an extremely complex environment where the need to
quickly gain knowledge of the combat situation is critical.  It is an environment that seems ripe
for improvement as shown by the following quote:
<P>"Although computerized tasking systems were used during 'Desert Storm', much of the planning
function was conducted as it had been for decades: with paper charts and grease pencils. . . .
What was needed, USAF decided afterwards, was a common mission planning system to help
commanders, pilots and crew coordinate missions for every aircraft across the inventory." 18
This is indicative of the opportunity for improvements to turn the vast amount of data available
from the 3,000 computers mentioned above into more usable information to help the commander
make quick choices. The Air Tasking Order (ATO) is an example of the type of decision making
that can benefit from improved information dominance.  There are many possible examples
where better information could improve decision making in a combat environment--the ATO is
used as just one example. 
<P> The ATO is the single integrated tasking document that directs all air activity against the enemy. 
It was used to run much of Desert Storm. 19 As reported in Airpower in the Gulf, Norman
Friedman claimed that the ATO decision cycle was too slow.  He said, "A more aggressive and
determined enemy might have done much better by exploiting its inherent lags." 20 The ATO is
the result of an extremely complex planning process.  It's production requires the synthesis of a
large amount of data on the current situation in a timely manner.  Anything that could improve
the quality and or timeliness of information processing  would improve the ATO process and
would certainly be advantageous in an air campaign.  
<P>
<B>Solution</B>
<P>
Anything that could improve the quality and or timeliness of information processing  would
improve the ATO process and would certainly be advantageous in an air campaign.
So, what can be done to improve decision making in the complex system environment of combat,
where time sensitive planning and decision making is required while handling this glut of data? 
One possibility is to improve the information that is used by those combat decision makers.  Ever
since computers were invented, people have been working on ways to better process data and
present information.  There is no single solution to the data glut problem.  There are, however,
several proven and promising technologies which, when implemented within the framework of a
feedback model, have the potential of improving the commander's understanding of the situation. 
This improved understanding can lead to better decisions.  The framework in which to view these
technologies is feedback control--cybernetics.  The technologies come from areas such as
artificial intelligence, semiotics, complexity theory, fuzzy models, and others.
<P>Before proceeding to explain cybernetics and potential techniques or technologies that may help
implement Air Force decision support systems, the relationship of cybernetics to information
warfare will be explored.

<H4>INFORMATION WARFARE</H4>
<P>

The concept of Information Warfare has recently come of age throughout the military services. 
It is so new that definitions, concepts, and doctrine are in the developmental stage; even the term
'information warfare' has not totally gelled.  This section of this paper will take a quick look at
information warfare.  The purpose is not to provide a thorough survey of the developing doctrine,
capabilities, threats, or technologies.  Rather, the purpose is to put the rest of this paper into the
perspective of information warfare and highlight the role cybernetics and the implementing
technologies described in this paper have as part of information warfare.  
<P>
<B>Definition</B>
<P>
The following is the current Air Force draft definition: "Information Warfare:  Any action to
deny, exploit, corrupt, or destroy the enemy's information and its functions; protecting ourselves
against those actions; and exploiting our own information operations." 21 The Defense Science
Board Summer Study Task Force on Information Architecture for the Battlefield (1994) says,
"Information Warfare is a term which has come to represent an overarching integrating strategy
to recognize the importance and value of information per se in the command, control, and
execution of military forces and in the implementation of national policy." 22
<P>The Air Force  currently has placed the following missions under the information warfare
umbrella: psychological operations, military deception, security measures, physical destruction,
technical operations, and electronic warfare.
<P>Psychological operations use information to affect the enemy's reasoning
Military Deception misleads the enemy on our capabilities or intentions
Security Measures include Operations Security (OPSEC - keeping the enemy from learning
about our military capabilities and intentions), Communications Security (COMSEC), and
Computer Security (COMPUSEC).
<P>Physical Destruction destroys information system elements through physical attack ranging
anywhere from conventional bombs to electromagnetic pulse weapons.
<P>Technical Operations is the use of computers and communications to directly attack the
adversary's information functions (acquisition, transmission, storage, or transformation of
information).
<P>Electronic Warfare denies information to the enemy.
<P>
<B>Current Focus on Information Warfare</B>
<P>
It is easy to get caught up in all the jargon and special terms used to describe information warfare
and its various components.  Looking at the basics, the Tofflers describe the information
requirement succinctly:  "Any military--like any company or corporation--has to perform at least
four key functions with respect to knowledge.  It must acquire, process, distribute, and protect
information, while selectively denying or distributing it to its adversaries and/or allies." 23
"Any military--like any company or corporation--has to perform at least four key functions with
respect to knowledge.  It must acquire, process, distribute, and protect information, while
selectively denying or distributing it to its adversaries and/or allies."
<P>In Information Warfare, Schwartau outlines four strategic goals of information warfare.  These
goals include theft of information, modification of information, destruction of information, and
destruction of the information infrastructure.24  All four of Schwartau's strategic goals are
focused on the handling or mishandling of information. They do not address the difficult process
of developing information from data.   Much of the material that I have reviewed on information
warfare looks at vulnerabilities (offensive and defensive) from the point where data has already
been developed into or is assumed to be useful information.  Hackers, viruses, encryption,
deception, communications infrastructure, Internet vulnerability, Desert Storm bombings of radar
sites--those are the areas that have been in the news and have brought much of the focus on
Information Warfare.
<P>This focus is definitely necessary--there are extreme vulnerabilities to the military in the above
examples and there is great potential to gain military advantage by exploiting the enemy's
vulnerabilities in the same areas.  However, it is important not to forget the other basics--the vast
advantage that can be gained through enhanced processing and understanding of the data that is
available to military decision makers.  Historically, as in the earlier examples of Desert Storm,
communications and computer systems have provided substantial advantage to military
operations.  Another example, in keeping with the ATO discussion earlier, is the Computer
Aided Force Management System (CAFMS) that was used in Desert Storm to produce the ATO.
The task of creating the ATO in the required time frames without this processing power might
have been impossible.  25   Using information processing capabilities in operational functions
such as this is a key component of information warfare.
<P>The Defense Science Board lists three "interlocked aspects of Information Warfare". 26
<OL><LI>The design and leveraging of one's own system to provide decision makers with actionable information.
<LI>The protection of those information systems from disruption, exploitation and damage.
<LI>The employment of offensive techniques such as deception, electronic jammers, munitions and advanced technologies to deceive, deny, exploit, damage or destroy adversary information
    systems.</OL>
<P.The first point captures the need to provide better information for decision makers.  Reflecting
back on the Tofflers' four knowledge functions (acquisition, processing, distribution, and
protection), it is easy to see that each function is vital.  The failure of any one is like breaking the
link in a chain.  However, it appears that the processing function has not received the same
degree of focus as the other functions.  Improvements in this Processing function may provide
the key to "actionable information."  Perhaps the ultimate capability in information warfare is the
ability of a commander to pierce the fog of war.  It is this aspect of information warfare where
cybernetics fits.

<H4>CYBERNETICS</H4>
<P>

Cybernetics is a term that evokes recognition in many people, but with an unclear meaning.  As
mentioned in the introduction, the cyber part of the word has taken on a life of its own.  Lately,
'cyber' has been used as a prefix to denote the use of advanced computer and communications
technology in almost any aspect of life--cyberspace, cyberspeech, cyberwar, etc.  For example,
Newsweek magazine now has a weekly section called "Cyberscope" devoted to things "cyber." 
Thus, many people view cybernetics as simply a term that connotes the use of computers.  To
others, cybernetics conjures up the fields of bionics and robotics and futuristic beings called
cyborgs. The origin of the word cybernetics is Greek, meaning steersman, and cybernetics, as a
field, was studied by Ampere in the 1800's.  The modern study of cybernetics began in the 1950's
and 1960's with writings by Norbert Weiner, William Ashby, Stafford Beer, and others. 
However, cybernetics as a separate field of study never reached the prominence of other
scientific fields, but became an integral part of many disciplines.  Cybernetics has become an
umbrella term that is not always used with the meaning upon which the field began.  This section
presents a broad overview of cybernetics summarizing the concepts developed by Weiner,
Ashby, and Beer.  It then explores the application of cybernetics to improve military planning
and execution.
<P>Cybernetics comes from the Greek word cubernhthz, which means steersman or governor. 
Webster's defines cybernetics as "the science of communication and control theory that is
concerned especially with the comparative study of automatic control systems (as the nervous
system and brain and mechanical-electrical communication systems)."  Weiner defined
cybernetics implicitly in the title of his book, Cybernetics, or Control and Communication in the
Animal and Machine.  Murray Eden outlined the basic concepts of cybernetics developed by
Weiner as quoted below.  Eden explains that Weiner's concepts are applicable in every branch of
scholarship.27
<P>"The notion that information can be handled as a mathematical quantity; that this quantity
mediates the transmission of energy and, therefore, can be used to control it; that statistical
uncertainty is itself a quantity related to (and degrading) information; that information can be
used to guide decision making and clarify our own descriptions of real-world phenomena; that
information may be transformed by computation; and that information and control can be
combined to create complex mechanisms that behave as if they were intelligent..."
William Ross Ashby is another one of the pioneers in the cybernetics field.  He wrote two of the
seminal cybernetics books, Introduction to Cybernetics and Design For A Brain.  In his early
studies, Ashby was trying to determine how the brain produces purposeful, intelligent, and
adaptive behavior.  He answered this by developing the concept of ultrastability.  Ultrastability is
achieved by an organism when it adapts to its environment by keeping the essential variables that
define the system (the interaction of the organism with its environment) within limits.  This is
achieved through the application of goal-seeking feedback.  
<P>The focus of Ashby's textbook on cybernetics is regulation and control.  His major concepts of
control are the state of a system, transformations of asystem's state, the black box, and variety.  Ashby was
concerned with how to keep a system at a desired state.  The diagrams at Figure 3 depict a
system T, subject to disturbances D, producing outputs defined by essential variables E, and
regulated by regulator R. 
<P>

<B>Feedback Control Systems</B><BR>
<I>Figure 3</I>

<P>
In the above figures the state of the system is defined by a set of essential variables (E).  The
system (T) undergoes a transformation with each disturbance (D), that acts on the system.   The
goal is to keep the system within predefined limits.  The regulator controls the actions of the
system to respond to any disturbance.  The regulator can receive feedback in two ways depicted
by the two diagrams.  In the diagram on the left (Anticipatory Regulator) the regulator receives
the disturbances at the same time the system receives them.  In the second (Error Controlled
Regulator), the regulator receives information about the resulting changed state of the system. 
The first scheme gives the regulator a chance to react to the disturbances and head off potential
impacts.  The second scheme only allows reaction to an already changed system state.
In dealing with complex systems, Ashby believed that it was impossible to understand the
internal workings of the system.  Rather, the system must be treated as a "black box" where only
the disturbances and resulting outputs of the system could be viewed to understand the behavior
of the system.  Ashby developed the Law of Requisite Variety to handle cybernetic control in
complex systems.  The law stated,  "control can be obtained only if the variety of the controller ...
is at least as great as the variety of the situation to be controlled."  Variety refers to the number of
inputs or states of the system.28
<P>




<B>Stafford Beer's Systems</B><BR>
<I>Figure 4</I>

<P>
The cybernetics concept of feedback has been applied across many disciplines--economics,
management, psychology, political science, sociology, and others.  Stafford Beer, one of the
famous cyberneticians, applied the cybernetics feedback concept to the area of management.  He
labeled cybernetics as "the science of control and communication - wherever these occur in
whatever kinds of systems." 29  Beer categorized systems in a matrix with two dimensions
(Figure 4).  One dimension classified systems into simple, complex, and exceedingly complex. 
The other dimension separated systems as either deterministic or probabilistic.  The focus of
Beer's study was on systems identified in the section of the matrix defined as  probabilistic and
exceedingly complex systems.  He placed such systems as the national economy, a corporation,
or the brain itself into this category.  His goal was to implement cybernetic control in industry
and government.  Beer's book, Brain of the Firm, explained his work to implement cybernetic
control for the government of Chile.
<P>Beer espoused three methods to apply cybernetic control to exceedingly complex systems.  First,
use feedback to make the system self regulating. Second, employ statistics and information
theory to handle the probabilistic, uncertain nature of the system.  And third, apply the concept of
the black box to deal with complexity.  Much of Beer's thought was an extension of Ashby's
ideas brought into the area of management.30
<P>

<B>A Cybernetic Model</B>

<P>
Figure 5 depicts a structural model of a cybernetic or feedback control system.  This model was
developed by Daniel Howland.31  It captures the major concepts of cybernetic feedback
developed by Weiner, Ashby, and Beer.  The following describes the components of this model:
Object of Control:  The object of control is defined by a set of essential variables (E).
Environment:  The environment introduces disturbances (D) that impact the object of control
causing its essential variables to range out of limits.
Monitor:  The monitor displays the current state of the system with information on the essential
variable that describe the object of control in addition to information on the introduction of
disturbances and the application of resources to thwart those disturbances.  In Howland's model,
the monitor is depicted as a graphical display to allow the controller to quickly determine the
status of the system.
<P>Controller:  The controller is the decision maker in the model who initially defines the goal state
of the system through the desired values of essential variables; receives input on the state of the
system from the monitor; and uses the system memory to aid decision making. 
<P>
Regulator:  The regulator takes the actions to employ those resources deemed necessary by the
controller to bring the system back within the EDESIRED limits.
Memory:  The memory holds all past occurrences of actions taken in the system.  These actions
are defined as D-E-R relationships:  a disturbance (D) causes the system to go out of limits (E)
and a resource (R) is applied to reestablish control.  This component of the model gives the
model the characteristics of an artificial intelligence expert system.  The memory holds those
actions that have been taken by past decision makers to bring the system back within limits.  The
memory also depicts Ashby's Law of Requisite Variety--in order for cybernetic control to be
effective the number of actions available to the decision maker (resources) must be as great as
the number of disturbances that can force the system out of limits.

Cybernetics - To What End?<BR>
In Cybernetics: The View From Brain Theory, Michael Arbib characterizes cybernetics as an
umbrella term.  He describes cybernetics as a conjoined study of brain theory and artificial
intelligence and further explains that others use the term to describe the study of complex
systems with the aid of computers.  Much of the original study of cybernetics has moved away
from an association with the word cybernetics into other disciplines which come under this
umbrella.  However, the term still serves an important purpose by bringing together the different
disciplines that cybernetic concepts share.32   Some of these disciplines are mentioned by
Richard Mattessich, "Cybernetics, systems theory, operations research, systems analysis,
computer science, communications theory, information science, artificial intelligence, automata
theory, and so forth, all overlap each other to a greater or lesser extent." 33  
<P>In the same way the term cybernetics pulls together various disciplines to support the control of
complex systems such as Stafford Beer did with industry and government, cybernetics can
provide the same broad focus to the military planning and execution cycle in combat.  The
important concepts provided by cybernetics for the combat commander are: 1) the view of
combat as a complex system and, 2) the vital importance feedback plays in controlling this
complex system.   According to Murray Eden in The Study of Information: Interdisciplinary
Messages, "Cybernetics as a viewpoint has entered into the unconscious of workers in almost
every branch of applied science and the sciences of man."34  In the same way cybernetics plays a
major role in the sciences, it should play the same role in military science.
<P>To many this idea of cybernetics and feedback control in military planning and execution may
seem totally obvious--of course the Air Force uses feedback.  For example, the whole concept of
intelligence is to provide feedback on the current situation.  However, according to General John
Shaud, the Air Force, at the operational level, has had at least two different 
views regarding the granularity and timeliness of feedback.  In an ongoing conventional/tactical
engagement, feedback, to be useful, must be detailed and swift.  In the nuclear/strategic
engagement, knowledge of a successful release was sufficient for operational planners.  The
former is most relevant to the post Cold War era and shows how the cybernetics thread can focus
more importance on planning and improve the process. 35
<P>As explained in the section on the Commander's Problem, combat can be viewed as a complex,
adaptive, and non-stationary process.  There are goals defined by the military mission.  There are
many disturbances--from both friendly and enemy happenings in the hostile environment--that
alter the state of the system.  And, there are resources in the form of troops and weapons that may
be employed to achieve the system goals.  The model (Figure 1) used to control the system is
really a cybernetics control model as shown in Figure 6.  The feedback loop shown highlights the
need for continual feedback to each of the phases of planning and execution.
<P>
<B>Military Planning/Execution - Cybernetic View I</B><BR>
<I>Figure 6</I>
<P>
Figure 7 shows another cybernetic view of combat planning and execution.  This figure
combines the two diagrams, Anticipatory and Error-Controlled Regulators, presented in Figure 7,
into a single model.  A commander must look at combat from both vantage 
points.  To the extent possible, he wants to predict and head off any disturbance or threat
introduced either by the enemy or any shortfall from the friendly side.  Also, he must continually
react to the outcome of actions already taken.  
<P>
<B>Military Planning - Cybernetic View II</B><BR>
<I>Figure 7</I>
<P>


Cybernetics does not offer any new technology that will solve problems such as the more timely
turn-around of the ATO.  However, cybernetics does provide the necessary framework for
improving such a problem.  The framework creates a focus on continuous feedback and planning. 
Development of systems that implement this framework is the key to improving planning and
execution at the operational/campaign level.  Such systems require a broad range of modern
technologies.

<P>
<B>Cybernetic Hierarchical Structure</B><BR>
<I>Figure 8</I>
<P>
Howland has looked beyond the application of cybernetics at just one level of decision making. 
Figure 8 shows the recursive nature of his structural cybernetics model.  In this figure, there are
cybernetic models that represent systems in their own 
environments (perhaps military units at different organizational levels) that feed information to
the levels above and below.  In this example, Howland envisions application at the strategic,
operational, and tactical levels of a conflict.
<P>
<B>Cybernetics - Russian View</B><P>
The field of cybernetics has been viewed differently in the former Soviet Union than in the West. 
It is important to understand this difference to put into perspective some of the Russian work
discussed later in this paper.  Cybernetics was introduced into Russia in the 1950's when the
subject was gaining audience in the United States.  However, at first it was not
followed--cybernetics was viewed as something of little value dreamed up by capitalistic society. 
This turned around almost overnight after Kruschhev called for wider application of cybernetics
during his speech to the 22nd Party Congress in 1961.  Cybernetics became to be viewed as the
science of control which could be exploited by a socialist society 
in controlling its economic and social systems--control that would be ideologically impossible in
capitalist countries.36  
<P>Cybernetics became a widely used term in Russian science.  For awhile, the term was used in the
title of almost any paper that covered a variety of subjects, such as control, time-series analysis,
statistical communications theory, automata theory, and others.  The main theme of cybernetics
that developed in Russia centered around the analysis and modeling of complex systems.  This is
the same view that is applicable to the complex systems environment of campaign planning.  It is
also key to the development of Russian situational control.

<H4>RUSSIAN SITUATIONAL CONTROL</H4>
<P>

One of the areas developed in Russia under the cybernetic umbrella was the field of situational
control.  Situational control was devised to handle the control of complex systems where the
traditional, more simplistic cybernetic models were insufficient.  This section of the paper will
describe the stages of situational control that developed from the 1960's through the current time. 
It will also describe the use of semiotics as employed in situational control.  Again, the goal of
this research is to determine whether or not the Russians have developed new theory and more
importantly implementing technologies to help control complex combat environments by
improving information feedback.  By reviewing the development of Russian situational control
and semiotic modeling techniques, insight into answering this question is gained.
<P>Information in this section was taken mostly from two sources.  First, translated versions of the
books on Situational Control written by Professor Dmitri A. Pospelov were used.  Pospelov is a
preeminent member of the Russian Academy of Science.  He has led the scientific development
of situational control.  The complete works of Pospelov have not been translated from Russian to
English.  Second, a conference on cybernetics and situational control was held in March 1995. 
Papers presented at this conference provided much of the information presented.  Before
proceeding with the development of situational control, the following is a short description of the
cybernetics/ situational control conference.
<P>
<B>Cybernetics Conference</B>
<P>To learn more about the Russian situational control and semiotic modeling to control large,
complex systems, a conference was held at the Battelle Memorial Institute.  The conference
included presentations and panel discussions over a week.  The bulk of the presentations were
made by the visiting Russian scientists.  A major goal of the conference was to determine if there
were areas where the Russian had developed theory and applications beyond those of Western
science and to, then, determine what follow-on, joint research programs could be developed to
advance those areas.  After the formal conference period, two days were spent in discussions to
determine follow-on research actions.  These tasks are detailed at the end of this section.
<P><B>Participants</B>
<P>
Attendance at the conference included the Russian delegation, professors from American
universities (Ohio State, Cornell, Drexel, and others), and representatives from various
government activities.  The Russian delegation included distinguished scientists in the fields of
artificial intelligence and mathematics.  The group included Dmitri Pospelov, the author of the
books referenced in this paper.  Also, present was Gennady Osipov, the Director of the Program
Systems Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences.  Other Russian scientists present at the
conference are listed in Figure 9.
<P>

The thrust of this conference was to provide a forum for the Russian scientists to describe their
scientific developments in the complex systems control area.  In order to understand part of the
motivation for their participation in this effort, it is helpful to take a look at the state of science in
Russia.
<P>
With the break up of the Soviet Union, Russian science has not received the funding that it has
historically received over the past many years.  According to an Associated Press story, many
American firms are taking advantage of this disarray in the Russian science establishment by
hiring Russian scientists at bargain prices.  The firms run the gamut from small entrepreneurs to
the largest of American corporations such as Ford Motor.  These companies have hired
individual scientists all the way up to  entire scientific staffs of 200 people. 37
The Russians have talent and knowledge in many scientific and technology areas that exceed and
complement Western capabilities.  For example, according to the same Associated Press article
mentioned above, Russian researchers excel in areas that require advanced computer analysis. 
One reason for this strength is the fact that the Soviet Union always lagged behind in developing
or having access to state-of-the-art computer hardware.  This forced them to compensate with the
development of advanced algorithms. 38 
<P>Interaction with the Russian scientists at the Cybernetics Conference supported this view of
Russian science.  All of the visiting scientists were looking for sources of funding to continue
their individual areas of research.  This drive came from two desires.  One desire that came
through very strongly was the simple love of science and knowledge.  The second was the need
to support themselves in the basic economic needs of life.  It was explained to me that salaries
for scientists in the employ of the government are routinely $50.00 per month.  While some of
the basics, for example, housing and utilities,  are provided, this small sum is not sufficient to
even provide for food.  If not able to find outside funding sources, the Russian scientists are
forced to find employment outside the scientific research field.  
<P>Thus, part of the challenge in understanding the work accomplished by the Russians in the area
of situational control is to understand where work has paralleled Western efforts.
The last perspective on Russian science was explained by Dr. Khoroshevsky during the March
conference.  He described the atmosphere of international cooperation that has existed over the
past decades.  During the 1960's and early 1970's all Russian work in the area of situational
control was conducted in isolation.  There was essentially no contact outside the Soviet Union. 
In the 1970's some contact with the international community began.  However, the contact was
limited to receiving information from outside the Soviet Union.  For example, these scientists
were not allowed to participate in conferences.  In the 1980's, a period of cooperation with
scientists of other countries began. 39  Thus, part of the challenge in understanding the work
accomplished by the Russians in the area of situational control is to understand where work has
paralleled Western efforts.  In some cases different terminology describes the same concepts. 
This together with the normal language differences between Russian and English is a barrier to
be overcome.

<I>Figure 9</I>
<P>
<B>Presentations</B><P>
The presentations provided by the Russian scientists were structured to cover the many areas that
contribute to situational control and semiotic modeling.  Figure 9 shows the topics covered.
<P>
<B>Evolution of Situational Control</B>
<P>
The diagram at Figure 10 depicts the theory of automatic control as described by Dmitri
Pospelov in Situational Control: Theory and Practice. 40  This is a traditional cybernetic
feedback model.  The diagram shows how the man in the loop, the Decision Making Person
(DMP), can control the object when there is a body of knowledge on the object of control.  The diagram shows that there are known
functions that relate the inputs (x,w) to the system outputs (y).  Also a function can be developed
to define the required actions to be taken by the controller given the inputs and outputs.  The
DMP remains in the loop to adjust the control function when desired. 
<P>
<B>Traditional Control System</B><BR>
<I>Figure 10</I>
<P>
 This traditional control model cannot be used to represent systems characterized below. 
Pospelov lists the following characteristics: 41
<P>
<OL><LI>Uniqueness - The object of control has such a unique structure and function that no standard
        model of control can be applied.
    <LI>Absence of a Formalizable Purpose of Existence - It is not always possible to formulate the
        exact purpose of the existence of an object of control.  For example, when looking at the
        existence of a large city, it is practically impossible to precisely formulate its purpose. 
    <LI>Absence of Optimality - Given the above two properties, it follows that it is impossible to
        build an objective control criterion for optimizing the object of control.  The criterion becomes
        subject-dependent on the decision maker.
    <LI>Dynamic - The objects of control change with time.  The control system must be adaptive to
        change with the changing of the object of control.
    <LI>Incompleteness of Description - It is impossible to provide complete information on an object of control.
    <LI>Presence of Free Will - Objects of control include people as part of the system.  People
        function in the system with their own personal goals, which are not always the same as the object
        of control or the decision maker.</OL>
<P>Situational control was developed to analyze systems characterized by the above properties. 
Tools developed to model simpler, stationary systems of traditional cybernetics are not capable
of handling more complex, non-stationary systems. Situational control is focused on control of
systems where it is difficult to describe the specific structure and functioning of the object ,
where behavior of people have an unpredictable impact on the system, and where the system
evolves through time, with increasing complexity.  This is the type of complex system into
which combat can be categorized.
<P>
 
<B>Situational Control Model</B>
<I>Figure 11</I>
<P>
The Situational Control Model at Figure 11 was developed to control these complex systems. 
This model was developed in the 1960's.  The following describes the functions of each of the
components of the above model:
<P><UL><LI>Analyzer - The analyzer receives the messages that convey the description of the current
        situation.  It evaluates each message to determine if anything has occurred in the system that
        requires control.  If nothing of importance has happened, no further action is taken.  If the
        Analyzer determines otherwise the message is forwarded to the Classifier.
    <LI>Classifier - The classifier determines from which of several classes a possible solution may
        come.  The different classes contain "single-step" solutions, which will bring the system back
        into control.
   <LI>Correlator - The correlator holds all the solutions in the form of logico-transformation rules.  It
       determines which solution to apply.  If the correlator cannot narrow its choice to a single rule to
       apply, it passes the choices to the extrapolator.
    <LI>Extrapolator - The extrapolator chooses among several different single-step solutions when more
        than one may apply to a particular situation.  
    <LI>Block of Random Selection - If neither the correlator nor extrapolator can decide on a solution,
        the Block of Random Selection either chooses a solution to minimize impact on the object or
        does not take any action.</UL>
<P>Pospelov explains that this model is the most efficient in situations where the number of possible different
situations is great, while the number of allowable single-step solutions is small.  But it may be
applied, albeit with greater difficulty, to situations which have a great number of allowable
solutions.  In general, situational control amounts to understanding a situation, classifying the
situation, and transforming the situation through single-step actions. Pospelov lists the following
seven characteristics of this early model of situational control:
<P>
<OL><LI>Large up-front cost.
    <LI>Difficulty of describing situation in a language that captures the right amount of information
        to allow classification and lead to the single-step solution.
    <LI>Language must allow qualification as well as quantification of situation.
    <LI>Initial single step solutions must be input by experts.  System must be able to develop new
        rules as it operates.  It must be capable of learning beyond the model initially defined by
        situations and single step solutions. 
    <LI>The results from such systems are inherently better than can be achieved by humans for many
        reasons: no influence from emotions, not effected by stress, nothing is forgotten, all solutions are
        analyzed.
    <LI>When looking at 'real' objects of control, several single-step solutions must be put together to
        solve more complex problems.</OL>   
<P>
Figure 12 shows the scheme of situational control developed in the 1970's.  As can be seen from
the figure, it takes the same basic form as the earlier model with the addition of a knowledge
base, a problem solver, and simulator.  The input at the top of the model from the controlled
object is data to describe the situation.  The output, which goes to the controlled object, are the
actions that are required to control the object. 

<P>
<B>Situational Control Model - 1970's</B><BR>
<I>Figure 12</I>
<P>
A short description of the parts of the model follow.  The coder takes the information (natural
language) that describes the current situation and converts it to a form that can be processed by
the model.  Pospelov calls this the Language of Situational Control.  The analyzer determines if
the situation is out of limits (critical).  The classifier and correlator determine if the situation is
typical and whether a solution already exists from previous experience or a solution can be
developed from previous experience.  The knowledge base holds information on previous
situations.  It is like the database for an expert system.  The problem solver determines the
recommended solution in conjunction with the correlator and simulator.  If the solution is not
known from the knowledge base, the simulator can test solutions. The decoder converts the solution from the
Language of Situational Control.
<P>
Many of the processes described in this situational control model of the 1970's are the same as
studied in Western artificial intelligence.  For example, natural language processing and expert
systems are major artificial intelligence fields. In fact, Pospelov explains that situational control
has much in common with the methods of artificial intelligence. 42  In the March 1995
conference, Pospelov presented Figure 13 and explained the correlation of this situational control
model with the original 1960's version.  Here it is clear that situational control employs AI  and
modeling methods.
<P>
<B>Situational Control Model - 1990's</B><BR>
<I>Figure 13</I>
<P>

<B>Application of Situational Control</B>
<P>One of the major goals of the cybernetics conference was to understand to what extent the
Russians have been able to apply situational control to complex, real world systems.  While some
examples were discussed at the conference, the true success of situational control has not been
adequately demonstrated.
<P>One example described by Pospelov was the control of harbor operations at the Odessa port.  The
situational control system controlled the access of ships to moorings.  Once in the moorings, the
system further controlled the operation of cranes necessary to unload the ships into storage
facilities.  The example was not explained in technical detail, but only in its high-level,
functional concept.  Another example, was the control of operations at nuclear power facilities. 
In this case, the extent of true control versus simple monitoring was not clear. Pospelov also
mentioned other examples of applications that had been accomplished from 1965 to 1985.  These
included control of cement heating in a rotary kiln, control of special drilling equipment in oil
fields, and the control of traffic.  Additionally, Pospelov said that situational control had been
used in a military application to control air battle. 43  Since these examples were discussed in
little detail, further analysis would be required to determine the success of the control systems.
<P>
<B>Semiotics</B>
<P>
Another area where it has been thought that the Russians have made scientific strides is the field
of semiotics.  "Semiotics is the science of signs and their life in society.  Its subject is all kinds of
signs: verbal language, pictures, literature, motion pictures, theater, body language.  Computer
semiotics is a branch of semiotics that studies the special nature of computer-based signs and
how they function in use."44  The first part of this definition presents the traditional view of
semiotics.  It has a very broad meaning--literature on the 
subject spans the gamut from analysis of the theater to linguistics.  The part of the definition that
addresses computer semiotics appears to be relatively new.  This definition approaches the way
the Russians are applying the use of the word in situational control.
<P>The Russians have applied semiotics to aid in the implementation of cybernetic or situational
control models.  The following paragraphs and accompanying diagrams develop the thought
process behind the Russian use of the term semiotics as explained through the work of Pospelov.
45
<P>
<B>Simple Control System</B><BR>
<I>Figure 14</I>
<P>
In the simplest of control systems (Figure 14) there are four components.  The input transformer
provides information about the situation and environment to the decision making function.  In
this simple case the 
decision mechanism is a deterministic or probabilistic function  which determines outputs based
on the inputs.  The output transformer passes the output determination to the object of control.  
<P>
<B>Adaptive Control System</B><BR>
<I>Figure 15</I>
<P>In figure 15 an adapter is added to the control system.  The adapter allows a more complex
solution--different sets of solution functions to be defined in F.  The adapter then chooses the
appropriate solution functions based on the situation of the object of control.
<P>
The next step in building towards semiotic models, a Model Based Control System, adds a
knowledge model to the control system as depicted in Figure 16.
<P>
               
<B>Model-Based Control System</B><BR>
<I>Figure 16</I>
<P>

This knowledge model contains both declarative and procedural knowledge about the object of
control, which is used by the decision making mechanism throughout the control process.
The model-based control system has several shortcomings when applied to complex systems. 
The knowledge model is fixed during the control process, but knowledge about and functioning
of complex objects is always changing.  To accommodate this change, Pospelov uses a semiotic
model.
<P>           
<B>Semiotic Control System</B><BR>
<I>Figure 17</I>
<P>

A semiotic model is defined as a reconstructible knowledge-based system.  As shown in Figure
17, the addition of an Interpreter to the Model Based Control System makes it a Semiotic Control
System.  The interpreter observes and interprets the responses of the object of control and the
environment in respect to the contents of the knowledge-based model (M) and reconstructs the
model.  To accomplish this the interpreter stores facts to find regularities in responses, builds
cause and effect chains, and uses a range of statistical processing.  Under the semiotic scheme the
knowledge based model and interpreter play the central role of controlling the system instead of
the decision making mechanism in the simpler control systems.
   
<P>           
<B>Situational Control - A Multidisciplinary Approach</B>
<P>Now that both situational control and semiotic modeling have been introduced, what is the tie
between the two?  The two terms address the same topic.  Situational control addresses the
function--the control of complex systems.  Semiotic modeling (semiotics) addresses the
technique for implementing situational control.  During the cybernetics conference these two
terms were used interchangeably in many cases.
<P>The key to implementing Russian situational control (semiotic modeling) is the integration of
different sciences and technologies.  This is apparent from looking at the various disciplines of
the papers presented during the conference.  The following disciplines were discussed during the
conference: cybernetics, complex systems, artificial intelligence with specific focus on natural
language processing and expert systems, formal logic, linguistics, cognitive graphics, and others.
I will not describe each of the Russian presentations--that will be provided in the conference
proceedings.  However, the following topics will provide an introduction to the multidisciplinary
approach that is required for situational control.
<P>
The simple definition of semiotics is the science of signs and symbols.  Two topics presented at
the conference, situational control language and cognitive graphics show two ends of the
spectrum in looking at the Russian use of the term semiotics.
<P>
<B>Situational Control Language</B><BR>
<I>Figure 18</I>
<P>
As shown in Figure 18, the goal of situational control language is the representation of the
situation.  The situational control language describes the a situation by taking information from
three sources.  The first two sources are from the situation itself.  First, the object of control is
described in terms of time, space, action, and cause as shown on the left of the figure.  The
second source is the summation of other elements in the situation and its environment as shown
in the upper right of the figure. The third source of information is from the knowledge base that
describes what was known going into the situation, such things as mission and plans. This
representation is continually maintained to reflect the latest state of the object of control in its
environment.  
<P>The situational control language itself is built using a logico-linguistic form that captures
elements to describe any situation, such as: name, entity, relation, imperative (command),
modifier, modality, quantifier, and evaluator.  According to Pospelov, situational control
language can be used to describe a large variety of situations with a relatively simple language. 
For example, with a basic set of less than 400 members any possible relation between an object
and its environment can be described, e.g., to be late, simultaneous, from the right, to move, to
chop, etc.  The explanation of the workings of the Russian situational control language is beyond
the scope of this paper.  However, this is clearly an example of the use of signs and symbols to
capture the understanding of a situation in a form that can be manipulated by a computer.
On the other side of the spectrum of semiotics mentioned above, is the human use of signs and
symbols to gain understanding.  Russian situational control also recognizes this important facet
of semiotics.  The presentation on cognitive graphics by Alexander Zenkin highlights this aspect
of the Russian approach.  The following few paragraphs summarize some of the points that
Zenkin made in his conference presentation. 46
<P>The human is always present in situational control--a human remains in the loop to have the final
say on any action determined necessary by the situational control system.  Thus, efficiency in the
human factors design of situational control systems is a major consideration.  According to
Zenkin, humans can process visual information much easier than other forms of information.
Zenkin made his main point with a picture of a human with only half of the brain present.  He
explained that a human's natural intelligence comes from the unity of the left and right
hemispheres of the brain.  In his picture only the left side of the brain was present.  The left side
provides the logical, mathematical type of thinking.  Zenkin explained that this person with only
the left side of the brain was analogous to artificial intelligence.  With only the intelligence of the
left side of the brain, thinking is deformed.  This applies to situational control, also.  Situational
control requires generating new alternatives/courses of action and, then, deciding between those
alternatives.  This requires creativity, which requires intuition.  Zenkin explained that the key to
the creativity and intuition is visual thinking.  This type of thinking is provided by the right side
of the brain. Cognitive graphics can supplement artificial intelligence by performing some of the
tasks normally provided by the right side of the brain.  According to Zenkin, by employing tools
that accomplish the functions of both sides of the brain, situational control systems can approach
natural intelligence.
<P>Situational control requires generating new alternatives/courses of action and, then, deciding
between those alternatives.  This requires creativity, which requires intuition.  Zenkin explained
that the key to the creativity and intuition is visual thinking.  This type of thinking is provided by
the right side of the brain.
<P>The concept of cognitive graphics was demonstrated by explaining the proofs of several
mathematical laws with pictures. Zenkin used famous mathematical problems, such as Waring's
Problem (1770), Hilbert's Theorem (1909), LaGrange's Theorem (1770), Pall's Theorem (1933),
and others.  Each of these theorems were extremely difficult to prove using the traditional
mathematical logic procedures that have been used over the ages.  The use of computer graphics
has allowed these theorems to be proved by generating graphical images of the mathematical
concepts.  These proofs were accomplished by letting the computer supplement the visual,
intuitive right side of the brain.  Cognitive computer graphics complements man's ability to
generate new knowledge. 
<P>Zenkin presented an interesting analogy to one of the latest technologies, virtual reality.  He
explained that virtual reality is to the physical as cognitive graphics is to the abstract--cognitive
graphics extends the virtual reality concept to the abstract.  In his presentation, Zenkin used
Figure 19 to draw this analogy between the physical and the abstract of cognitive graphics.

<B>Conference Follow-On Research</B>
<P>
At the end of the cybernetics/ situational control conference two days were spent discussing
future collaboration with the Russians.  Several projects were chosen as follow-on efforts.  The
overall goal of these projects is to further understand and have demonstrated situational control
and its components.  The ultimate goal is to apply the concepts of situational control to American
problems of complex control.
<P>First American scientists need translations of the situational control literature.  This requires
translation of Russian works.  The following books were chosen:  A. Zenkin, Cognitive
Computer Graphics, 1991; D. Pospelov, Logico-Linguistic Models in Situational Control, 1981,
and G. Osipov, D. Pospelov, Semiotic Modeling, 1995.
Since this conference sparked interest in some of the American academics, it was decided that a
semiotic modeling and situational control workshop be planned as part of the Large Complex
Systems Workshop at the upcoming IEEE Conference.  This workshop will provide extensive
coverage of situational control.  The audience at this workshop should have a much broader
attendance from American academia.  
<P>Specific areas presented during the conference resulted in the following projects.  A natural
language interpreter will be demonstrated. This prototype interpreter converts natural language to
situational control language.  Much interest was generated by Prof. Zenkin's presentation on
Computer Cognitive Graphics.  Prof. Zenkin will port his software to state-of-the-art computers
and examine additional applications.  The Russians were asked about the relationship between
situational control and Complexity Theory being developed at the Santa Fe Institute.  A paper
will be developed exploring this question and a small workshop will be developed to explore this
issue.  Finally, white papers will be developed by the Russians on many of the topics discussed.
<P><B>Situational Control Summary</B>
<P>The key to the Russian approach to Situational Control is the integration of concepts and tools
from many disciplines.  The preceding topics--situational control language and cognitive
graphics--were just two examples of the tools that the Russians are integrating.  To accomplish
this integration, the Russians have used a team of scientists, each having expertise in the different
disciplines.  This team is led by Prof. Pospelov.  
<P>The disciplines brought together under situational control include systems control, artificial
intelligence, computer science, decision support, fuzzy logic, linguistics, modeling, and others. 
Comments provided by American professors who attended the conference highlight the potential
of the Russian multidisciplinary approach.  One made the comment (after hearing the overview
of situational control presentation) that each of the boxes used in the presentation diagrams
represented entire fields of study in the United States.  Each of the separate fields of study hold
conferences which focus on much narrower topics.  Problems arise when scientists from each of
these fields do not understand the other fields and do not interact with scientists from the other
disciplines to tackle hybrid fields such as situational control.  Another professor supported this
view and explained that situational control was a combination of systems control and artificial
intelligence--intelligent control.
<P>Thus, there is much in common between the tools and techniques used in Russian situational
control and the tools and techniques used in Western sciences, such as artificial intelligence.  
However, more work is required to move past the differences in language and terminology to
fully determine the potential for situational control.  Clearly, the multidisciplinary approach
taken by the Russians is worth further research.

<H4>CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS</H4>
<P>
The growth of information technology is phenomenal.  The Air Force is definitely in the
information age.  Taking advantage of all the technology of the information age provides huge
benefits as well as huge challenges.  One of the challenges which seems to grow at a very fast
pace is how to deal with the vast amounts of information made available to decision makers from
all the advances of the information age.  For the Air Force, this challenge manifests itself most
importantly in how to transform data into information and sift through the information to make
the extremely important planning and execution decisions required in combat.  The level at
which the most help is needed in this area is the operational/campaign level.  It is one of the most
complex decision making levels and stands to benefit the most from improvements.
<P>Russian situational control should be further studied by the Air Force to evaluate its utility as an
approach to improve control and decision making for Air Force combat at the
operational/campaign level.
<P>Cybernetics provides a framework to address this problem.  Air combat can be viewed as a
complex control problem.  Without question, complexity is a prominent characteristic of warfare,
and information is a resource to resolve this complexity.  "Cybernetics studies the flow of
information around a system, and the way in which that information is used by the system as a
means of controlling itself." 47 There is nothing magical or new in cybernetics.  Rather, the
concepts of feedback and control which define cybernetics have been around for a long time. 
The key is to recognize the importance of building control systems that provide the feedback fast
enough to aid decision makers.  Changes in the world political environment have made the world
much less predictable and more complex.
<P>So, if the answer is to implement better feedback control systems to improve decision making,
then, how it this done?  Or, what technologies can be employed to implement such systems? 
This paper looked at the Russian use of situational control.  The sciences and technologies that
the Russians are using to implement control of complex systems in a variety of requirements (to
include military), are the same as those used in the West.  They include artificial intelligence,
control, modeling, fuzzy logic, and others.  One aspect of the Russian approach stands out--the
merging of all these disciplines into the area called situational control.  A multidisciplinary
approach is necessary when addressing multidimensional problems. 
<P>This leads to the first recommendation. Russian situational control should be further studied by the Air
Force to evaluate its utility as an approach to improve control and decision making for Air Force
combat at the operational/campaign level.  This research should be conducted as a joint effort
with representatives from the operational, scientific, command, control, communications and
computer (C4), and intelligence communities.  Air Combat Command and Air Force Operations
have a vested interest in anything that has the potential to improve operational planning and
execution of the air battle.  Both Rome and Armstrong Laboratories have expertise in the
disciplines such as artificial intelligence.  Other support areas that have a major role in
information warfare--Intelligence and C4 Systems--should be represented in this effort.  Any
work to pursue this should be a joint effort with the other military services.  The potential of
situational control, if reached, is equally applicable to each service.  As has been already
mentioned, the Army is interested as evidenced by research projects they have initiated. 
Additionally, other organizations have displayed interest--the Defense Intelligence Agency and
US Central Command.
<P>The integration of many disciplines to build situational control seems to be the most unique
contribution of the Russian work.  However, the efforts in the individual areas may also provide
new scientific information.  For example, Zenkin's work in cognitive graphics stirred a great
amount of interest in both the academic and the military people present at the cybernetics
conference.  
<P>The second recommendation is to build on the relationship established with the Russian
delegation of scientists.  There is a vast amount of knowledge and talent available to the United
States in Russian science.  Not only has the end of the cold war made this accessible to us, but
the current state of affairs in Russia and with Russian science, in particular, has created an
environment where Russian scientists are looking for opportunities to share their knowledge and
talent.  It is not clear how long such an environment will last.  At a minimum, Air Force
representatives should participate in the follow-on work efforts that resulted from the
cybernetics/situational control conference, such as the upcoming IEEE Conference.
If situational control lives up to its promise, processing and analysis of data to provide timely
feedback can improve decision making and provide substantial gains in warfighting capability.
The third recommendation, which is related to the others, is to include the study of situational
control in the new Information Warfare arena.  The area of situational control fits into that part of
Information Warfare that provides "actionable" information.  If situational control lives up to its
promise, processing and analysis of data to provide timely feedback can improve decision
making and provide substantial gains in warfighting capability.  A major information warfare
goal in is to use information to get inside the opponent's decision cycle and, if possible, control
his behavior with means short of combat.

<H4>Introduction</H4>
<P>Well before dawn on January 17, 1991, Major Greg Biscone flew the first of two B-52s
toward Wadi Al Kirr airfield a recently completed forward fighter base in central Iraq.  His
targets were the taxiways between the runway and hardened aircraft shelters.    
 <P> Skimming 300 feet over the desert at 500 miles per hour it was so dark the night vision
goggles and low light TV system didn't help.  Iraqi early warning radars forced Biscone to drop
his huge, old bomber lower the surface to air missile (SAM) threat was greater than the danger
of flying within a wingspan of the ground.  Minutes later, Biscone's 'Buff' and its counterparts,
executed a successful multi-axis attack crippling the airfield and leaving anti-aircraft artillery
with nothing to fire at but the receding noise of egressing B-52's.1  
 <P> Less than an hour earlier, stealthy F-117s had struck the heart of the enemy Baghdad in
the opening minutes of the war.  Tomahawk Land Attack Cruise Missiles (TLAMs) followed,
striking critical electric systems and government decision and communications centers.  F-15Es,
part of an initial covert entry scheme into Iraq, attacked known Scud launch facilities that
threatened Israel and Coalition members.  While Biscone and his flight were departing the target
area in central Iraq, similar attacks occurred at four other forward fighter bases spread across
Iraq.  At the same time, thirteen F-117s flew against twenty-two separate targets including
command leadership bunkers north of Baghdad, communications exchanges in Baghdad,
interceptor operations centers in Kuwait, satellite downlink facilities, and vital communications
nodes around the country.  In western Iraq thirty aircraft killed Iraq's chemical air attack
capability.  Just north of Basrah, 38 fighters put Shaibah airfield out of commission, and 44
others stripped away the medium altitude SAM defenses west of Baghdad near Al Taqqadum
airfield, the Habanniyh oil storage area, and three chemical weapons precursor facilities to clear
the way for daylight attacks the following afternoon.      
 <P> Before the crews of Biscone's flight landed back at Diego Garcia, Republican Guard
headquarters in the Basrah area and regular Iraqi ground forces near the Saudi border were under
attack.  All suspected biological weapons storage sites were targeted and critical oil storage
facilities were hit.  Conventional air launched cruise missiles (CALCMs) fired by B-52s flying
from the United States reached electric facilities at Al Mawsil in Northen Iraq.  By the end of the
first 24 hours of the war, bombs also hit enemy bridges, military support and production
factories, and naval facilities.  In all, more than 1300 "offensive" sorties were flown that day.2 It
was not the number of sorties however, that made this first day of successful air attacks so
important, but how they were used their effects.       The first night of the Gulf War air campaign
demonstrated that the conduct of war had changed.  One hundred fifty-two discrete targets plus
regular Iraqi Army forces and SAM sites made up the master attack plan for the opening 24
hour period of the Gulf air war.3  The Gulf war began with more targets in one day's  attack plan
than the total number of targets hit by the entire Eighth Air Force in all of 1942 and 19434 more
separate target air attacks in 24 hours than ever before in the history of warfare.5

<H4>PARALLEL WARFARE:  WHAT IS IT?</H4>
<P>

  What was different about the concept of the air campaign in the Gulf War from previous air
campaigns?  What allowed planning against such a large number of targets in so short a time? 
What allowed the Coalition to achieve its aims so quickly and with relatively little loss of life on
both sides?  What does this mean for the size, shaping, and use of military forces in the future? 
This essay explores these key questions to illustrate the transformation of warfare seen in the
Gulf and how those changes may anticipate future warfare.  Understanding the changes in the
traditional application of force that occurred during the Gulf War should facilitate the
exploitation of technology and development of warfighting concepts to better meet the defense
challenges of the future.     
 <P> In short form, the lesson is a strategy that capitalized on a construct of warfare designed to
paralyze Saddams control of forces; and then went on to neutralize the enemy's capacity to fight,
undermined its will to fight, reduced its military production base, and created the conditions to
control its capacity to build weapons of mass destruction.  This construct avoided Iraq's strengths
on the ground its vast defensive armies that had the potential to inflict high Coalition
casualties.
 <P> The construct of warfare employed during the Gulf War air campaign has become known as
parallel warfare.6  The term comes from basic electrical circuit design.  Anyone experiencing the
frustration of Christmas lights on a series circuit versus a parallel circuit will recognize the
analogy.  In the series circuit depicted at the top of figure 2, when the switch closes, electrons
flow from the battery to the five light bulbs illustrated.  However, electricity must pass through
each light before the next is lit sequential flow.  In the parallel circuit at the bottom of figure 2,
when the switch closes electricity reaches all the lights virtually at the same time simultaneous
flow.
<P>
  
<I>Figure 2 Basic Electric Circuits</I>
<P>
  Applying the same concept to the application of force in war yields the terms serial
(sequential) and parallel (simultaneous) warfare (see figure 3).  A simplistic analogy perhaps, but
accurate.
   <P>  

<I>Figure 3 Series versus Parallel Warfare</I>
<P>
  In air campaigns before the Gulf War, force was applied sequentially to 'roll back' enemy
defenses before attacking targets of the highest value.  Area and point defenses had to be
eliminated before war planners could get to what they really wanted to attack.  In the upper
portion of figure 3, 'Series Warfare Sequential Attack,' the early warning sites, airfields,
operations centers, anti-aircraft artillery, and SAM systems are targeted.  Each target clears the
way for the next one until finally the target of value, in this case leadership, can be hit.  The huge
effort required to suppress enemy air defenses and the time required to accomplish these tasks in
sequence limit the feasibility of attacking several high value targets simultaneously.           
<P>  Targets of highest value are generally those most protected by an adversary.  It makes perfect
sense to reduce enemy defenses before attacking these high value targets:  reducing enemy
defenses increases the probability of attacking the target successfully; and reducing enemy
defenses allows attack on key targets without prohibitive losses.  The Eighth Air Force's mission
to Schweinfurt, Germany on October 14, 1943 sustaining 20 percent bomber losses is a
familiar and dramatic example of what happens when enemy defenses are fully functional and
effective.  High losses caused by Luftwaffe fighter defenses demonstrated the imperative for
control of the air to reduce friendly losses and allow daylight 'precision' bombing.
<P>  The middle section of figure 3 depicts simultaneous attack against the same set of targets. 
Hitting all elements of an air defense system simultaneously facilitates attacks on high value
targets, but this still leads to a somewhat sequential application of force.  The majority of targets
are defenses enroute to, and in the area of the target of value.  This kind of partial simultaneous
attack can be accomplished with large force packages of non-stealthy aircraft in discrete areas of
a theater or on a one time attack against a limited target set.  However, the large force packages
to suppress enemy air defenses tends to limit the total number of areas struck in this manner. To
hit an entire theater set of high value targets requires many attacks in a similar fashion.     
<P>  A capacity for simultaneous attack on the entire array of high value targets with little or no
need to suppress enemy air defenses opens the door to monumental changes in the conduct of
war enables surprise at the tactical level, a larger span of influence, fewer casualties, paralyzing
effects, and shorter time to impose effective control over the enemy.  The lower portion of figure
3 depicts simultaneous attack against a wider array of high value targets than in the previous
case.  Leadership facilities, key essentials such as refined oil and electricity, transportation nets,
connectivity between the leadership and the population, and fielded military forces are attacked
at the same time.7  The capacity to have a controlling effect on the enemy's ability to act as
desired is clearly much higher in this case than in the previous examples.  
<P>  More high value target coverage in a short time is not the only benefit of parallel attack. 
When combined with a strategy to render an adversary ineffective in controlling its
state/organization, essential industries, transportation infrastructure, population, or forces, the
ramifications of parallel attack extends well beyond the arithmetic advantage of hitting more high
value targets in a shorter time.   
<P>  The successful prosecution of parallel war requires more than compressing sequential attacks
into one simultaneous attack.  Parallel war exploits three dimensions time, space, and levels of
war.  In the opening hours of the Gulf War, all three dimensions were exploited:  Time within
the first 90 minutes over fifty (50) separate targets were on the master attack plan.  Within the
first 24 hours, over 150 separate targets were designated for attack.8  Space the entire breadth
and depth of Iraq was subjected to attack.  No system critical to the enemy escaped targeting
because of distance.  Levels of war national leadership facilities (strategic level), Iraqi air
defense and Army operation centers (operational level), and Iraqi deployed fighting units air,
land, and sea (tactical level) came under attack simultaneously.  
<P>  Simultaneous application of force (time) across each level of war uninhibited by geography
(space) describes the conduct of parallel warfare.  However, the crucial principles defining
parallel warfare are how time and space are exploited in terms of what effects are desired and for
what purpose at each level of war.
<P>  Historically, the principal way to get to enemy vulnerabilities their centers of gravity was
through destruction of defending forces.  Centuries of surface warfare created the common view
that the intrinsic purpose of military force is the destruction of an enemy's military force.  Adding
to the weight of this legacy is misinterpretation of Clausewitz's monumental work, On War, as
reducing warfare to the physical destruction of opposing forces in "decisive" battles.9  While not
the "sound bite" Clausewitz might have liked his students to remember, it is the lesson many
carry away.10      
 <P> Well beyond the activity of destroying an opposing force lies the ultimate purpose of war to
compel a result.  Use of force to control rather than destroy an opponent's ability to act lends a
different perspective to  the most effective use of force.  Control the ability to dominate an
adversary's influence on strategic events does not necessarily mean the ability to manipulate
individual tactical actions.  For example, during the Gulf War Iraq was able to launch individual
aircraft sorties; however, because Iraq's air defense system was rendered ineffective by Coalition
operations, individual aircraft sorties flown were of negligible consequence.  
 <P> Any political entity of interest can be thought of as a system consisting of a number of
sub-systems, or to borrow a term coined in the former Air Force Systems Command a system
of systems.11  The ability to affect essential systems on which an adversary relies to achieve
influence is critical to this concept of control as is correct identification of which systems are
'essential.'  Using force to achieve specific effects against portions of a system that render the
entire system ineffective, yields effective control over that system.  This notion introduces new
terms to describe how application of force can achieve effective control over an enemy,
including: render ineffective, negate, disable, prevent, neutralize, limit, reduce, stop, etc.  Force
used to effectively control a system rather than destroy it, may lead to the same operationally
relevant result, but with much less use of force.      Achieving effective control conserves forces
that would otherwise be needed for destruction; this in turn expands the number of systems
exposed to control through force application a form of leverage.  For example, shutting down
the power grid that provides electricity to the air defense system around Baghdad requires much
less force to negate the air defense system than destroying each element of that air defense
system.  Effective control of enough of the adversary's enabling operational level systems will
paralyze his ability to function at the strategic level.  At that stage, the enemy has no choice but
to acquiesce to the will of the controlling force or face ever increasing degrees of loss of control
itself.      
 <P> The significance of the capacity to hit a large number of targets simultaneously in the Gulf
War was not simply that a lot of targets could be destroyed, but that vital enemy systems could be
brought under effective control.  This was made possible through attack of systems in parallel,
and at rates high enough that Iraq could not repair, adapt to, or find alternatives to keep critical
systems functioning at a level sufficient to continue resistance.  
 <P> The object of parallel war is to achieve effective control over the set of systems relied on by
an adversary for power and influence leadership, population, essential industries, transportation
and distribution, and forces.12  Action to induce specific effects rather than simply destruction of
the sub-systems making up each of these strategic systems or 'centers of gravity' is the foundation
of the concept of parallel war.  The crux of parallel war is not its physical elements, but the
conceptual ones.  At the edge of the Twenty-first century the significance of the evolution of
change in warfare lies in the way we think about it.

<H4>PARALLEL WARFARE:  Where Did It Come From?</H4>

  Simultaneous attack in any type of warfare has always been desirable.  Historically, it has
been used to achieve surprise in an opening move of a longer lasting sequential series of
campaigns or in campaigns and operations of short duration.  Japanese attacks against Pearl
Harbor and the Philippines within a matter of hours are an example of the former, while the
Arab-Israeli War of 1967 and the raid on Libya in 1986 are examples of the latter.   
<P>  There are three primary reasons simultaneous air attack never evolved to the degree of
parallel war demonstrated in the Gulf War:  1) the requirement for mass to compensate for a lack
of precise weapons delivery; 2) the high number of resources required to suppress increasingly
effective enemy air defenses; and, 3) the absence of an operational level concept focusing
principally on effects to achieve control over an opponent rather than destruction in the aggregate
to achieve military objectives.  The first two required technological solutions which were not
mature before the mid 1980s to sustain continuous attacks against the most vital enemy target
systems.  Those two technological solutions namely stealth and precision enabled the third
and perhaps most important, a concept of operations aiming to achieve control over an enemy's
systems.
<P>  The idea of targeting large systems to achieve debilitating effects is not new.  It was a central
tenet of the strategic air offensives against Germany and Japan during World War II.  Early in the
twentieth century theorists described the vulnerability of 'modern' nation states' highly
centralized, interdependent political and economic structures to air attack.  Lord Montague in
1909 spoke of crippling an entire nation through air attacks on "nerve centers" like London.  The
targeting of, "government buildings, the Houses of Parliament, the central railway stations, the
central telephone and telegraph offices, and the stock exchange" all attacks against the nation's
central nervous system producing a "massive and fatal paralysis."13  Similar theories were
advanced by Italy's Giulio Douhet, America's  Billy Mitchell, Britain's Arthur Tedder, and others. 
Their ideas were summarized in an early statement of the United States Army Air Corps: 
"Disruption or paralysis of [vital] systems undermines both the enemy's capability and will to
fight.  Proper selection of vital targets in the industrial/economic/social structure of a modern
industrial nation, and their subsequent destruction by air attack, can lead to fatal weakening of an
industrial enemy nation..."14     
<P>  Early work on identifying critical targets vulnerable to air attack was conducted by the Air
Corps Tactical School (ACTS), the forerunner of the current Air University.  Searching to
formulate doctrine for an air offense against modern industrialized states, a few instructors there
began a systematic evaluation of industrial, economic, and social development complexes in the
United States.  Air Corps Tactical School findings led to a "subtle but very significant variation
from the doctrines of Douhet and Mitchell.  The latter advocated destruction of factories and
industrial centers and population centers.  The school favored destruction or paralysis of national
organic systems on which many factories and numerous people depended..."15  They went on to
identify electric power systems, transportation systems, railroads, fuel, food distribution, steel
manufacturing, and other manufacturing industries vital to the operation of the economic and
industrial well being of the state.  Parallel war takes these ideas one step further, aiming not just
to impede the means of the enemy to conduct war or the will of the people to continue war, but
the very ability of the enemy to control its vital functions.  
Precision An Enabling Factor in Parallel War
<P>  The difficulty in extracting the maximum potential from earlier theories of strategic attack
was shortcoming in execution.  Even when control of the air was wrested from the Luftwaffe in
the spring of 1944 and Allied aircraft were free to roam the Axis skies, the level of 'precision'
bombing still required a thousand aircraft to succeed against one target.  Only a very small
percentage of bombs usually hit their targets.  Over the entire war, only about 20 percent of the
bombs aimed at targets designated for precision attack fell within 1000 feet of their aim point.16 
The large number of aircraft needed to achieve success made simultaneous attack technically
impossible.  Generally, target sets were attacked in sequence even after control of the air was
secured because large numbers of aircraft had to be massed repeately to debilitate just one target
set.  
<P>  The World War II campaigns against the German ball-bearing and aircraft production
industries took seven months in part set back by the lack of air superiority over Germany.  Even
with air superiority however, the transportation campaign took five months, and the oil campaign
took six months.  These relatively long periods of focusing against one target gave the enemy
time to recover in other target systems making it impossible to paralyze more than one target
system at a time.  "...to knock out a single industry with the weapons available in 1943 and early
1944 was a formidable enterprise demanding continuous attacks to effect complete results."17     
<P>  In World War II, air commanders were "compelled to substitute sheer tonnage for
precision..."18  However, World War II also witnessed the first combat use of precision guided
munitions (PGMs).19  The challenge of dropping bridges spurred the further development of
PGMs, and the last year of the Vietnam war saw the first large-scale use of laser guided bombs
(LGBs).20  By the time of the Gulf war, PGMs overcame the necessity to mass aircraft for
successful attack.  During the Gulf War over 9000 LGBs were used out of a total of
approximately 220,000 bombs.21  This seemingly small portion of the total number of weapons
dropped understates the consequence of their effect.  In some cases, a single aircraft and one
PGM during the Gulf war achieved the same result as a 1000 plane raid with over 9000 bombs in
World War II and without the associated collateral damage.22  PGMs can offset the need for
mass attacks to achieve a high probability of success.   
Stealth Technological Leverage
<P>  As aerial weapons delivery accuracy improved after World War II, so did air defenses.  By
the early 1970s, radar detection and radar guided surface guns and missiles were highly lethal
against air attack.  Experience in the Vietnam war and the 1973 Arab-Israeli war indicated that
highly defended targets would yield to successful attack only with large 'force packages' of
aircraft.  Designed to get strike aircraft into and out of a target area, each force package
contained besides the bomb dropping aircraft aircraft to suppress enemy early warning and
surface-to-air missile radars, to destroy or jam enemy defensive missile systems, and defend
against enemy aircraft attacks.  A typical force package during the Linebacker I campaign in
Vietnam consisted of 62 combat aircraft (not including air refueling support) to get 16
fighter-bombers in and out of the target area.23  Even though weapons delivery had become more
precise by the early 1970's, the high number of support, force protection, and defense suppression
aircraft needed to successfully attack a target constrained the number of targets that could be
attacked at any one time.
<P>  Delaying enemy radar detection until too late for reaction reduces the effectiveness of any air
defense system.  Techniques to reduce radar cross section a measure of the ability of a radar to
"see" a signal return from a radar reflective target saw early application on reconnaissance
aircraft and drones in the late 1950s and 1960s.  By late 1978, the Lockheed F-117 was being
developed, and it became operational in October 1983.  The last of 59 F-117s was delivered in
July 1990.24  The next month some of them deployed to Saudi  Arabia.            
<P>  The combination of stealth and precision radically reduces the number of aircraft, supporting
personnel, and infrastructure required to effectively strike a large number of targets.  The
significance of the stealth and precision combination was first captured in October 1990 in a
relationship calculated from the version of the air campaign master attack plan existing at the
time: "The planning effectiveness of the F-117 (stealth) is illustrated by the fact that it accounts
for only 5% of the combat aircraft (30/580) yet it strikes 44% of the first 24 hour targets
(emphasis in original)."25  During the entire war, the F-117 stealth aircraft flew less than 2
percent of the total combat sorties, while attacking 43 percent of the targets on the master target
list.26 
<P>

<I>Figure 4 Stealth aircraft flew less than 2 percent of the combat sorties but hit over 40 percent of
the strategic target base during the Gulf War.</I>
<P>
  A comparison of the first non-stealth aircraft attack in the Basrah area with a wave of F-117
strikes at the same time illustrates the enormous leverage of the stealth/precision combination. 
The non-stealth force package consisted of 38 aircraft and three drones attacking one target with
three aimpoints.  The force package consisted of:  four A-6s and 4 Saudi Tornados dropping
bombs on the target; four F-4Gs providing suppression for a particular type of SAM; five
EA-6Bs jamming Iraqi early warning and acquisition radars; seventeen F/A-18 fighters carrying
radar-homing missiles to suppress SAMs, and four other F/A-18s providing air-to-air
protection 38 aircraft, so 8 could drop bombs on 3 aimpoints.  At the same time, twenty stealth
aircraft (F-117s) were targeted against 37 aimpoints in other areas with the same and even higher
threat intensity27 an over 1200 percent increase in target coverage using 47 percent fewer 
aircraft.  
<P>
<B>Effects Versus Destruction</B>
<P>
  Targeting manuals include words about targeting to achieve effects, but pages and chapters
written about damage expectancy, probability of damage, and weaponeering to achieve levels of
destruction.  This focus on destruction results from two traditional concepts of war annihilate
an enemy through outright destruction or  exhaust an enemy before he exhausts you (attrition).28  
<P>  An alternative concept of warfare is based on control the idea that an enemy organization's
ability to operate as desired is ultimately more important than destruction of the forces it relies on
for defense.  To render the enemy force useless is just as effective as eliminating the enemy force
itself in terms of securing favorable conflict termination.  Furthermore, controlling an adversary
can be accomplished quicker, and with far fewer casualties.  In words attributed to Sun Tzu: 
"those skilled in war subdue the enemy's army without battle.  They capture his cities without
assaulting them and overthrow his state without protracted operations."29  Rather than the
operative means to inhibit enemy activity, destruction should be viewed as one means to achieve
control over enemy activity.  In this approach, destruction is used to achieve  effects on each of
the systems the enemy organization relies on to conduct operations or exert influence not to
destroy the systems, but to prevent them from being used as the adversary wants.  Effective
control over adversary systems facilitates achieving the political objectives that warrant the use
of force.     
 <P> Generally, conventional planners and intelligence personnel tend to think about targeting in
terms of "the required number of sorties to achieve the desired damage against each target."30 
The bread and butter of a targets officer involves "determining the quantity of a specific weapon
required to achieve a specified level of damage to a given target."31  An intelligence evaluation of
the effectiveness of the air campaign during the Gulf war demonstrates how focus on individual
target damage rather than the effects of attacks on the system under attack can be misleading.  
 <P> On February 15, 1991 the Iraq target planning cell received a report on the progress of the air
campaign in accomplishing its target set objectives.  Because all the targets in the primary and
secondary electric target set were not destroyed or damaged to a specific percentage, the analysis
concluded the objective had not been met.32  In actuality, the electric system was not operating in
Baghdad, and the power grid in the rest of the country was not much better off.  The effect
desired in attacking this system was not destruction of each of the electric sites, it was to
temporarily stop the production of electricity in certain areas of Iraq.  The planning cell knew the
operating status of the Iraqi electric grid and had already reduced strikes against electric sites to
maintenance levels.33  The determinant of whether to plan a strike on an individual site was
whether the electric system was operating in the area of interest, not the level of damage or lack
thereof to an individual site.  
 <P> During the war some power plant managers shut down their electric plants to avoid
targeting the desired effect achieved without exposing Coalition members to danger, and
freeing up air resources for another task Sun Tzu's dictum fulfilled.    
 <P> While the virtues of planning to achieve systemic effects were discussed early in the
conceptual phase of the air campaign planning effort, initial attack planning was done on the
basis of traditional destruction-based methodology.  For example, early in the process,
intelligence identified two major sector operations centers (SOCs) providing command and
control of Iraqi air defenses one in Baghdad, and one at Tallil air base in southern Iraq.34   Each
was hardened to protect two underground command and control bunkers.  Weapons experts and
target planners determined it would take 8 F-117s with a mix of GBU-27 and GBU-10 2000
pound bombs to destroy the bunkers at each SOC.  Since only 16 F-117s were available for
planning at that time, destroying the two SOCs meant using all the available F-117s an 8 to 1
aircraft to target ratio.
 <P> Intensive planning for the offensive air campaign began in theater on August 21, 1990.  By
August 30, the known targets in the strategic air defense system expanded almost tenfold. 
Further intelligence analysis of the Iraqi air defense network found not just two SOCs in Iraq, but
four, and associated with each of these SOCs were 3 to 5 interceptor operations centers (IOCs),
and associated with the IOCs were a number of radar reporting posts.  The new information
significantly increased the challenge in attaining the operational objective to "render Iraq
defenseless and minimize threat to allied forces."35  For the initial attack plan, the effect desired
was to shut down the air defense command and control system in certain areas enabling
non-stealth aircraft to approach their targets without resistance.  However, there were not enough
stealthy F-117s to destroy each of the newly discovered nodes of the air defense system.  
<P>  The solution lay in effects-based rather than destruction-based targeting.  Postulating that a
2000 pound bomb could go off in the other end of the building in which the air campaign
planners were working, one of the planners made a case that while the planning group might
survive, if so they would abandon the facility to seek shelter.  The point was that the SOCs and
IOCs did not require destruction.  Targeting only had to render them ineffective, unable to
conduct operations through the period of the ensuing attacks by non-stealthy aircraft. 
 <P> By September 6, the attack plan was re-written putting no more than two F-117 loads on any
particular SOC.36  This greatly multiplied the number of stealth/precision strikes for use against
other targets IOCs, biological, and chemical weapons storage facilities, and other critical 
targets.  Consequently, the opening 24 hours of the air war found 42 F-117 sorties flying 76
target attacks37 almost a 1 to 2 aircraft to target ratio.  Compared to the original plan, just over 2
1/2 the stealth strike sorties were attacking 38 times the target base.38  
 <P> The process of planning for effects is complex.  Planners in conjunction with intelligence
must determine which effects on each enemy system can best contribute to the fulfillment of the
military and political objectives of the theater campaign.  This depends upon the specific
situation, political and military objectives, enemy vulnerabilities, the target systems themselves,
and weapon system capabilities.  Since a campaign plan is highly dependent on the weapon
systems available, an effective plan must extract maximum impact from those systems not in
terms of absolute destruction of a list of targets, but in terms of effects desired upon target
systems. 
<P><B>Concept of Operations</B>
<P>  Strategy is the orchestration of means to accomplish ends.  The process of selecting air assets
(means), and assigning them against target systems to achieve specific effects (ends) is the air
strategy for an air campaign.  It is generally articulated in a concept of operations (CONOPS)
describing friendly force intentions and the sequence of operations to accomplish the command's
objectives.  Of concern here is not so much the process or format of a CONOPS, but rather the
philosophy underlying the air strategy.
<P>  The command and control organization developed for planning and execution of
air-to-surface attack in the Vietnam war, the Tactical Air Control System (TACS), focused to a
large degree on allocating sorties to individual targets in support of ground operations.  To a
large extent, ground commanders selected and prioritized targets for the majority of operations
processed by the central element of the TACS, the Tactical Air Control Center (TACC).39 
Effectiveness in air-to-surface operations was measured in terms of responsiveness and efficiency
in destroying individual tactical level targets.  Battle damage assessment focus was on
destruction of individual targets.  The function and organization of the TACS led many to
confuse the efficiency of hitting individual targets with the effectiveness of achieving campaign
objectives.40
<P>  The TACS was established in doctrine as the air command and control system for
conventional war.41  Improvements to the TACS between Vietnam and the Gulf War focused on
improving responsiveness, enhancing sortie production rates, and incorporating modern systems
to quickly process large air tasking orders (ATOs).  Emphasis was on improving process little
effort or time was spent on development of air strategy or providing tools for the planning of air
strategy.  The "marriage" between Tactical Air Command (TAC) and the Army's Training and
Doctrine Command (TRADOC) in the 1980s elevated the Army's doctrine of AirLand Battle as
TAC's de facto air strategy in regional conflicts.42  Basic Air Force instructional documents on
target planning had a complete chapter on AirLand Battle targeting, but no mention of principles
or guidelines for conventional strategic attack.43  The Air Force's largest and most influential
conventional air command, TAC, entered the 1990s with its vision of conventional war focused
on supporting the Army critically important but, only one element of its versatile potential.44    
<P>  Since the established planning process for conventional theater air warfare did not have any
process beyond support of land forces on the battlefield, the principal focus of most Central
Command Air Force (CENTAF) TACC planners and intelligence personnel in Riyadh in the late
summer of 1990 was on tactical operations.  With dedication and a sincere commitment to
applying airpower in the best way they knew how, TACC personnel were the product of their
past.  The established procedures for the design of an air tasking order led them to a conventional
force planning focus based on a mechanistic application of sorties against a list of individual
targets in a sequential fashion.  The process was often referred to as 'servicing a target list.'  
<P>  The offensive air campaign employed against Iraq in early 1991 came together between
August 1990 and January 1991.  On August 8, 1990, CINCCENTCOM asked 
the Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force to put together an air option for potential use against the
Iraqis.  The effort resulted in Instant Thunder an initial concept of operations, a draft OPLAN,
and an initial cut at a first 24 hour attack plan.   Embracing the concept on August 17, the CINC
directed the key planners to deliver the concept to his joint force air component commander
(JFACC) who was also acting as CINC-forward in Riyadh.  While not comfortable with the
completeness of Instant Thunder, and feeling it lacked attention to defensive response to further
Iraqi aggression, the JFACC did ask some of the Washington based planners to remain in theater
to form a nucleus of an offensive planning organization.   It was known simply as the special
planning group, later as the "Black Hole" because of its highly classified status requiring special
access clearance.
<P>  The architects of the air campaign did not limit themselves to the 'servicing a target list'
approach.  The design of the air campaign grew out of a mindset questioning how to impose
force against enemy systems so every effort would contribute directly to the military and political
objectives of the Coalition.  Planning began with a critical examination of potential strategic
centers of gravity, their constituent operational systems, and led to identifying the set of
individual targets making up each system.  Assessment of whether to continue or stop attack
against a particular system's target set was dependent on achieving the effects desired on the
system.  Individual targets only became important if the system was still operating.  If the effects
desired were achieved it did not matter that individual targets may not have been hit.  Returning
to the electrical example, it did not matter to the air campaign planners that several individual
targets remained undamaged the electric system was shut down.
<P>  Figure 5 illustrates the subtle, but significant difference between the destruction-based and
effects-based approaches to warfighting.
<P>       
<I> Figure 5 Air Campaign Attack Schemes (Parallel versus Serial)</I>
<P>
  The upper half of figure 5 shows two methods of the series targeting approach a single
prioritized list, and multiple target set lists prioritized in sequence.  The serial approach targets
those elements of an adversary's defenses that restrict access to targets of critical value.  For
example, early warning radars, air defense systems, command and control nodes, and airfields are
hit before production, government, and leadership facilities.  This series methodology can be
applied against an adversary's entire target base, or against a group of individual targets.  This is
not unlike the approach taken in World War II.  However, attacking one target system at a time
allows the others to continue operation or recover from previous attacks.  
<P>     The parallel attack scheme is shown in the lower half of figure 5.  The ideal application of
force in a parallel attack strategy involves the application of force against all targets in each target
system at one time.  With correct identification of target systems and appropriate targets critical
to each system, if each target is hit the effects desired within each system will occur.  The
simultaneous application of force in such a manner would enable friendly control over the
adversary systems.  In reality however, the number of aimpoints to conduct such a campaign will
generally exceed the conventional resources available.  The difference between the total number
of aimpoints, and the number of assets required to hit each, will influence campaign duration.
 <P> If all the target set aimpoints cannot be hit in one attack, then those with the most significant
impact in each set should be hit first.  Counter air operations, for all the reasons as in the past,
become a primary consideration when the attack force is not fully stealthy.  Targeting is weighted
to paralyze the air defense areas in which non-stealthy assets would operate.  This is the reason
for the skewing depicted in the lower half of figure 5 toward the target sets A, B, C, etc.,
notionally representing air defense, airfield, and the command and control target sets.  The
weight of strikes against other target systems can increase with the attainment of air superiority,
and continue until desired effects are obtained.
<P>  What figure 5 does not show, and what must be understood about the theoretical application
of force is:  First, that intelligence is never complete about an enemy, its strategic centers of
gravity, the constituent operational systems, and the set of individual targets making up each
system.  Second, an enemy will attempt to negate the effects of actions taken against them while
trying to respond effectively.  As a consequence, parallel war may involve more than one set of
force application, even if the resources are available to attack all the known elements of all the
identified systems that might affect the enemy.  Any enemy may react to attack in ways not
anticipated, may have elements unknown to the friendlies, or the friendlies may not possess the
capacity to quickly and effectively counter an enemy move.  Any or all of these contingencies
may change the calculus of the original parallel attack formula requiring additional application of
force and lengthening the time to achieve desired effects.    
<P>  Mobile Scuds, bad weather, untimely BDA, incomplete intelligence, and a variety of other
frictions extended the duration of the Gulf War air campaign.45  An attraction of parallel war is
its potential to reduce the time duration of conflict relative to previous wars.  However, the
reality that knowledge of all elements affecting the conduct of war in each situation is always
incomplete means the application of force to achieve war winning effects will take a finite, but
undeterminable time.  Duration of parallel war is determined by how well its dynamic elements
are understood and how effectively the functioning systems of an adversary can be paralyzed.       
<P> 
           In 1990, the confluence of stealth, precision, and an effects-based operational plan
allowed the planning and implimentation of an air strategy based upon simultaneous attack
against the entire array of target sets in a sustained air campaign.  Stealth obviated the need for
large numbers of suppression and force protection assets to strike a heavily defended individual
target air superiority is inherent to a degree in the nature of stealth itself.  Precision reduced the
number of assets required to achieve a specific effect against an individual target.  A focus on
systemic effects rather than individual target destruction leveraged assets for strikes against other
targets.

<H4>PARALLEL WARFARE:  Why Is It Important?</H4>

<P>
  Parallel warfare is the manifestation of the 'revolution in military affairs.'  More than a means
of applying new technology, parallel warfare calls for a basic realignment in war planning.46  The
character of warfare is changing and the degree of that change is considerable analogous to the
difference in world views between Ptolemy and Copernicus.  Ptolemy reasoned that the universe
revolved around the earth not unlike the way some ground commanders think about a corps
being at the center of all warfare.  Copernicus set science straight recognizing that the earth was
but one part of a much greater universe, and it revolves around the sun not unlike the actual
relationship between air, land, and sea operations and a joint theater campaign.
<P>
<I>Figure 6 Ptolemaic and Copernican Views of the Universe and Analogies to Common
Warfighting Perspectives Today</I>
<P>

  The implications of parallel warfare include:  First, parallel war offers a viable alternative to
attrition and annihilation as the means to compel an adversary's behavior.  Second, parallel war
exploits current weapon systems while transitioning to emerging technology.  Third, to best
exploit the potential of parallel war, the military must institute organizational changes.        
<P>
Parallel war demands change in concepts of force employment.
<P>  War colleges teach two principal forms of warfare attrition and annihilation.  The Gulf War
demonstrated another paralysis through the application of parallel war.  The strategies of
annihilation and attrition rely on individual target destruction as the ultimate method of success
and measure of progress generally measured in terms of forces applied, or input.  In parallel
war the determinant of success is effective control of systems that the enemy relies upon to exert
influence output.  Changing the way we think about the application of force may produce more
effective use of force.
<P>  The combination of stealth and precision redefines the concept of mass.  Mass, in the sense of
an agglomeration of a large number of forces, is no longer required to achieve a devastating
effect upon a system of forces, infrastructure, government, or industry.  No longer do large
numbers of surface forces require movement, positioning, and extensive preparation before we
can achieve dominant effects over an enemy.47
<P>
<I>Figure 7 Target coverage: First 24 Hours of Gulf War48</I>
<P>
   Surface forces will always be an essential part of the military, but massing surface forces to
overwhelm an enemy is no longer an absolute requisite to impose control on the enemy.  It
requires more aircraft to transport a light infantry division vintage 1991  than to move the
total number of PGMs delivered during the Gulf War.49  What moves into a theater and
when should be determined by its ability to effectively influence an adversary.  Furthermore,
massed friendly forces air, ground, sea present a lucrative and vulnerable target to an enemy
attack, particularly as weapons of mass destruction proliferate among potential hostile states.  
Mass, a valued principle of war, in some situations is a vulnerability.
<P>  Since the ability to impose effects is independent of the massing of forces, the projection of
force becomes more important than the deployment of force.  The object of presence or massing
of force in a region is ultimately influence.  The operative element achieving influence is the
threat or actual use of force to achieve a particular effect.  If the same effect can be imposed
without the physical presence or large scale massing of forces, then in some circumstances the
deployment of forces can be replaced by the projection of forces to achieve the same effect.  A
Libyan-style raid is one example of a situation for which we now have a capability to apply the
projection concept (figure 8).    
<P>
<I>Figure 8 Projection of Force Verses Deployment of Force</I>
<P>
  A recipient of a PGM does not know or care if the weapon came from near or far, or from
what kind of platform, or from what kind of base.  For military, political, and economic reasons
the capability to project force to achieve influence has immense advantages compared to
deploying force for the same purpose.  
<P>  The evolving security environment requires: greater responsiveness the ability to act in
hours rather than weeks or months, long range the ability to span the globe without forward
basing, effective punch the ability to deliver weapons with precision to achieve desired effects,
and high leverage the ability to reduce personnel, support, and overall dollar cost.  Paul Nitze, a
former Secretary of the Navy notes: "We cannot depend on getting conventional ground forces
into a hot spot quickly enough to deter further aggression, or should deterrence fail, to prevent an
early fait accompli by an invader.  Long-range bombers...can provide firepower with speed and
reach, and demonstrate seriousness of intent in a way that missiles or carrier battle groups
cannot."50  Focusing on influence the end of strategy, rather than presence the traditional
means to achieve it, enables us to consider different and perhaps more effective ways to
accomplish the same goal with fewer resources.
<P>  Systems-based intelligence analysis is critical to the application of parallel war.  Without
adequate information about what an adversary relies upon to exert influence and conduct
operations, parallel war cannot be effective.  This potential vulnerability can be reduced by
exploiting advances in space-based systems, communications technology, and rapid information
transfer by reducing the need for forward-based organizational elements.  Intelligence during the
Gulf War is a good example of the rudimentary use of these capabilities.  Much of the
intelligence used in planning and execution of the Gulf War air campaign came from outside the
theater.      
<P>   Redefining the concept of mass, relying on force projection rather than force deployment,
and aiming to control adversary systems rather than using attrition and annihilation to destroy
them requires changes in the current approach to force management.  The changes needed may
include more reliance upon out of theater command, control, communications, computer, and
intelligence (C4I) organizations, distributive intelligence architecture, and "off-board" systems
that can provide information direct to the user.  These structural changes can reduce reaction time
for effective use of intelligence, reduce the requirement for forward basing, and enable effective
force application without having to deploy large command and support elements.  Each of these
changes moves vulnerable control nodes away from the enemy.  Changing the manner in which
we think about the application of force requires changing the way we structure to employ it.    
<P>
Parallel war is a concept fully exploiting weapons of today yet 
promising greater impact with the emerging weapons of tomorrow.
<P>  We are in a transition phase of the ongoing revolution in military affairs.  Parallel war departs
from traditional strategies, but we fight with the tools available today.  We must carefully
manage the transition to the new instruments of war to assure their development is not restricted
by the theories of the past, and to adapt current systems to this more lucrative strategy.  It will be
a difficult transition.  The tendency to retain orthodox concepts and doctrine is strong when the
means upon which those concepts and doctrine were built, still make up the preponderance of
weapons.  While military doctrine is invaluable in establishing a basis for application of force, it
must not be allowed to constrain application of force in ways that might prove effective, but
different from traditional modes.  Parallel war provides a useful construct on how to conduct war
that can bridge the gap between the weapons of today and the weapons of the future.  It allows
useful application of current weapon systems as we acquire a new generation of tools needed to
fully exploit the concept.     
<P>  During the major draw down of forces at the end of the twentieth century it is imperative that
new weapon systems and those retained from force cuts meet the demands of the evolving
security environment while giving us the most capability for the dollar.  However: "The widely
held assumption about post Cold War force levels has been that we can make do with less of the
same:  the same weapons and technology, but in radically reduced numbers."51  The results of the
1993 DOD "Bottom Up Review" tend to confirm this observation, which is no surprise since the
weapons systems for the near term exist today.  The apparent significance of the new elements
that enabled the military success in the Gulf the impact of revolutionary technologies such as
stealth along with the mature state of precision and new concepts for the employment of those
systems may be diminishing as the footprints of the Gulf War recede and are covered by the
inertia of past warfighting paradigms.52  Current weapons were built for strategies of the past. 
We must guard against reverting to the better known past, allowing inertia to distort strategies of
the future, or allowing a previous 'monopoly' of a mission area to inhibit more effective
application of new technologies or operational concepts.  Put positively, we must expand our
thinking, disenthralling ourselves from stale notions of warfighting to seize the opportunities at
hand.  
<P>  The air campaign in the Gulf used bombs and missiles on aimpoints of individual targets to
achieve a specific effect within the parent system.  The air campaign gave us a view of the
leverage that stealth, precision, rapid and secure information transfer, ready access to accurate
positional information, and other cutting edge technological systems can provide.  However,
while the aircraft/PGM match of the early 1990s was orders of magnitude beyond the systems
used during World War II, it is crude compared to the ideal means for the conduct of parallel
war.  We must continue to explore follow-on systems that will provide even higher leveraged
effects.  As technological innovation accelerates, 'non-lethal' weapons will become the operative
means of parallel war.  
<P>  The ability to achieve effects directly against systems without attacking their individual
components would allow a preferable application of the concept of parallel war than we are
capable of today.  Indeed, the ultimate theoretical application of parallel war would involve no
destructive weapons at all effects are its objects, not destruction.  Non-lethal weapons,
information warfare, and space-based systems have the potential to approach that theoretical
goal, and are the next steps in the evolution of tools for the conduct of parallel war.  
<P>
The military must recognize the requirement for organizational change in battlespace
management to best exploit the potential of parallel war.
<P>  The end of the Cold War and the dramatic reduction in military forces of the United States
have accelerated the need for effects-based military strategy.  We can no longer afford
duplicative systems, but more pertinently, we may no longer have the option of overwhelming
force or an abundance of weapon systems to conduct war in the future.  Today, the permanence
of the philosophies of attrition and annihilation tend to inhibit the development of organizations
and doctrine that apply parallel war.  
<P>  The Coalition was fortunate to have an overwhelming number of air forces in the Gulf War. 
When elements of one force component chose to bypass the joint air planning process, the Joint
Force Air Component Commander (JFACC), in the interest of avoiding doctrinal strife, could
afford to rely upon forces directly under his command  to accomplish theater objectives.53  In the
future the luxury of each Service component force doing its own thing may not be an option. 
Decisions on the use of force must be made on the basis of how they can have the most effect in
accomplishing the joint force commander's theater objectives.  
<P>  While non-lethal weapons and information warfare will allow us to further capitalize on the
concept of targeting for effects while continuing to limit casualties, only new organizations and
doctrine aiming to exploit the parallel war strategy can fulfill the full potential of this concept. 
Non-lethal weapons and information warfare should enhance the ability of our forces to conduct
operations to directly achieve desired effects.  In this respect, recent attempts to develop and
write joint military doctrine are helpful when their focus is on weapon system capabilities and
effects-based planning rather than employment environment or presumptions of attrition and
annihilation.  The Gulf War was a joint endeavor.  However, the most valuable meaning of
jointness is not the equal or obligatory use of each Service in every contingency or war. 
Jointness is the use of the most effective force for a given situation.  Too often "jointness" is
interpreted as a 'federated' rather than 'integrated' or unified application of Service components. 
To paraphrase President Bush, jointness is the use of the right force at the right place at the right
time, and one could add, for the right purpose.54
<P>  An example of capability-based weapons allocation was the incorporation of the Tomahawk
Land Attack Cruise Missiles (TLAMs) as part of the Gulf War air campaign.  The Navy's original
TLAM target list had many targets suitable for both aircraft and TLAM strike.  The strategic air
campaign planners' capability-based perspective, and the JFACC's unified targeting of both
aircraft and TLAMs made it possible to avoid duplication, and maintain focus on the air plan
objectives by using the two types of systems synergistically.  TLAM attacks on soft targets were
used to keep pressure on Baghdad during the day, while the F-117s with GBU-27s were
employed at night against hard targets requiring penetration.  In a similar vein, the first combat
use of the Armys ATACMS was initiated by air campaign planners applying an integrated
approach to the use of force.  Country of origin, service component, special operations force,
missile, aircraft, or helicopter did not matter desired effect and system capability were the
drivers of weapon selection for the air campaign.   
<P>  Each system's capabilities were exploited not to achieve service co-participation, but because
their capabilities enhanced attainment of the campaign objectives this was a key, but often
neglected and widely misunderstood reason for the success of the Gulf War air campaign.  Too
often "jointness" is interpreted as a rationale to assure proportional service co-participation. 
Jointness is a means for ensuring success not an end unto itself.  Parallel war does not exclude
any force component in time, space, or level of war at the outset of any political-military
challenge.  However, that does not equate to each force always participating in every operation or
to a degree in some proportion to their size or presence.  Whoever can perform the operations to
achieve the desired effects best at the time should have it assigned to them.  
<P>  Optimum parallel war is dependent upon a functional organization encompassing not just the
air component, but the entire theater campaign (ie. a joint force land component commander, a
joint force naval component commander, as well as a joint force air component commander) with
a true joint force commander (not dual-hatted as a component commander as well) orchestrating
the synergies of the entire force.

<H4>CONCLUSION</H4>

<P>
  In the Gulf War of 1991, airpower from all the services proved its potential as a definitive
military instrument.  Airpower did not act in isolation however.  It worked in conjunction with
support from surface forces.  Sea forces conducted a maritime interdiction campaign before and
during the application of airpower.  Ground forces helped to protect Saudi Arabia and reoccupied
Kuwait after the air campaign had paralyzed enemy systems allowing Coalition ground forces to
maneuver with minimal casualties.  Retired Marine Corps Lieutenant General Bernard Trainer
and New York Times  correspondent Michael Gordon conclude in, The Generals War,  "It was
also the first war in history in which airpower, not ground forces, played the dominant role."  
 <P> While the tenets of parallel war could be applied in every medium of warfare, the
characteristics of airpower speed, range, flexibility, precision, and lethality fit seamlessly
with this strategic construct.55  Airpower has the potential to achieve effects at every level of war
directly and quickly.  As a result, it will remain the dominant means for conducting parallel war
in major regional conflicts for the immediate future.   However, more important than the
characteristics of airpower is the strategic perspective associated with its most effective use a
perspective that views the theater or globe as well as the aerospace medium as an indivisible
whole where weapons are selected based on their ability to influence.    
<P>  Parallel war has the potential to reduce force requirements, casualties, duration of conflict,
forward basing, and deployment of forces previously required to win in war. The parallel
approach changes the basic character of war.  The Desert Storm air campaign gave us a glimpse
of its potential, but the change is only just beginning.  Airpower systems will evolve beyond
manned aircraft, but the philosophy behind the use of those systems will remain.  It is an
evolution of the philosophy born with the airplane the antithesis of attrition and annihilation
warfare.  It is the philosophy of control over an adversary's strategic activity by direct influence
and effect on the adversary's ability to act.  
<P>  It is strategic vision, rather than flying skills, that will add value to the ongoing
transformation of war.  In reality, the parallel approach is a springboard for better linking
military, economic, and political elements to conduct national security strategy in depth. 
<P>  Some in the Russian military, studying very closely the conduct of the Gulf War, recognize
the potential of new military technologies and strategies for the orchestration of war.  Identifying
Desert Storm as one of the "rare 'turning points' in military affairs fixing the evolution of warfare
at the "juncture of two epochs in military art," they see the end of multi-million-man armies and
the emergence of 'aerospace war' as the determinant of military actions.  Acknowledging that
strategic objectives can be achieved through direct use of 'aerospace strikes' they have gone so far
as to postulate that, "victory can be achieved without the seizure and occupation of territory by
ground forces."56  
<P>  Whether such proclamations are accurate or not is not really relevant.  What is relevant
however, is the potential danger that exists if our own military institutions become blind to the
possibility of change in the nature of war.57  Seeing new technologies only as a means to
modernize a preferred way to conduct war, rather than a means to exploit change in the nature of
war, may prove disastrous.  Potential antagonists recognize the significance in the 'revolution in
military affairs' now underway it would behoove us to do the same.  
 <P>   The title of a front page article in the July 15, 1994, Wall Street Journal reads, "How Wars
Are Fought Will Change Radically..."  The way war is fought has changed radically a
revolution in the planning of war has occurred.  Paralysis through parallel warfare was the basis
for air campaign planning in the Gulf War.  The challenge for a military steeped in the traditions,
paradigms, and strategies of the past is recognizing the change, embracing it, and capitalizing on
it before someone else does.  Machiavelli said:  "There is nothing more difficult to carry out, nor
more doubtful of success, nor more dangerous to handle, than to initiate a new order of things." 
He might also have added that there is nothing more worthwhile.

        specifically to facilitate planning the Gulf war air campaign.  A script at the operational level of
        war providing direction for the construction of the air tasking order (ATO), it specified targets,

<H4>Introduction</H4>
<P>
     On September 1, 1993, seven months into the Clinton Administration, Secretary of
Defense Les Aspin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Colin Powell released the
new administration's strategic analysis of United States security needs for the post-Cold War era.  
The Bottom-Up Review: Forces for a New Era,1 which quickly became known simply as the
BUR, established the framework from which the national security strategy was developed and
fixed the design, composition and purpose of military forces the US will maintain for the balance
of the decade and, possibly, well into the future.  In short, the BUR's influence is far reaching. 
But in spite of its significant influence, the Bottom-Up Review has been widely criticized outside
the administration.
<P>     Johns Hopkins University professor Eliot A. Cohen called the BUR "remarkably
conservative and intellectually timid."2  Reagan administration Assistant Defense Secretary
Lawrence Korb, now at The Brookings Institution, labeled the BUR force structure "Bush-lite"
because of its similarity to former President Bush's Base Force, only marginally smaller.  Robert
L. Borosage, a senior fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies, found the BUR lacked a new
strategic concept and offered little more than the earlier Bush plan "stuffed into the Clinton
budget constraints."3  The Defense Budget Project's Andrew F. Krepinevich argued that the BUR
force is "primarily organized to wage the last war more effectively, rather than prepared for the
greatest or most likely challenges to US security."4  A report by the Center for Strategic and
International Studies found that the BUR force  "broken conceptually and fiscally."5
<P>     BUR critics are not restricted to universities and think tanks.  A General Accounting
Office analysis found the BUR force underfunded by as much as $150 billion through the end of
the decade.6  The Congressional Budget Office estimated the defense procurement account,
which funds modernization, to be underfunded as much as $200 billion over the next fifteen
years.7  The Pentagon itself acknowledged that the BUR program was underfunded, predictably
by a lesser amount.  At the press conference announcing the BUR recommendations, Secretary
Aspin acknowledged a $13 billion funding shortfall.  Four months later Aspin's replacement as
Secretary of Defense, William J. Perry, put the funding shortfall in the $20 billion range.8  
Under Secretary of Defense and BUR steering group chairman John Deutch later raised the
shortfall estimate to $40 billion.9  Each of these shortfall estimates assume the administration's
future year defense budgets will be fully funded, which is highly questionable in view of the
ongoing battle between the administration and Congress over balancing the federal budget in
seven years.  The actual underfunding will be the current shortfall projections combined with any
additional cuts imposed to achieve budget balance.
<P>     In the two years since the BUR's release, the senior Defense officials responsible for the
report have all left the Defense Department.  Secretary of Defense Les Aspin resigned three
months later and subsequently died.  Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman General Colin Powell retired
at the end of the month, wrote his autobiography, and declined to become a candidate in the 1996
Presidential election.  BUR steering group chairman, Under Secretary of Defense John Deutch
left to head the Central Intelligence Agency.  Yet, the Clinton Administration has steadfastly
rejected any notion of updating or revising the BUR's strategy , force mix and design, or
projected costs.  As recently as September 21, 1995, at his confirmation hearing before the
Senate Armed Services Committee for a second term as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
General John M. Shalikashvili emphasized that no replacement for the BUR is warranted or
desired by the services.10
 <P>    The purpose of this paper is four-fold.  First, I will review the rationale behind the
Bottom-Up Review and examine the analytical framework the steering committee used to reach
its force structure and strategy recommendations.  This review includes a comparison of the
recommendations with the process parameters to determine if another steering group composed
of different policy actors would reach the same findings and recommendations.  In other words, I
will look at the analytical framework that the BUR steering group reportedly employed and
determine if the analysis consistently leads to the same conclusions and recommendations.  This
examination is relevant precisely because of the extensive criticism directed at the BUR.  Is this
criticism warranted and if so, was it caused by faulty analysis?  Or, can other factors explain the
criticism?
 <P>    Having established the correlation between the analysis and policy recommendations,
next I will review the politics behind the process.  Specifically, I will consider whether, and to
what extent, domestic politics intervened to limit the potential and applicability of the BUR
recommendations, and why, in spite of its obvious and widely reported short-comings, the BUR
survives as the framework for the national security strategy.  I will use Graham Allison's
bureaucratic politics model to argue that domestic political constraints on the new administration
precluded a realistic appraisal of our security needs and dictated the BUR results before the
steering group held its first meeting.  And in spite of the passage of time and the departure of
senior BUR planners, those same domestic political constraints still restrict administration
options, forcing adherence to a flawed strategy and the maintenance of an ill-designed force.
 <P>   The third purpose of this paper is to examine several of the BUR assumptions and the
implications of its recommendations for future defense organization.  BUR critics, including both
the General Accounting Office and the Congressional Budget Office report the BUR force is
significantly underfunded and that without substantial increases in budget authority, readiness
will suffer.11  To maintain readiness without reducing the force, Defense officials are delaying
modernization programs which will inevitably reduce the force's competitive technological
advantage.12  Over the past ten years, force size has been reduced by one-third while budget
authority for military procurement has dropped from $132.8 billion (1995 dollars) for fiscal year
1985 to about $43.3 billion for 1995, a cut of more than 67 percent.13  The BUR strategy of
fighting two conflicts simultaneously requires a force that is too large to modernize and to keep
ready at the same time, within projected funding levels.  The validity of this requirement is
examined along with its impact on force design and budget requirements.  
 <P>    The fourth purpose of this paper is to propose other considerations for achieving US
national security objectives not addressed adequately by the BUR and to recommend possible
solutions to the BUR funding shortfall.  In making such recommendations, it is necessary to
break with conventional force planning.  Inevitably, a number of military and political cherished
oxes will be gored.  Short of passively adopting the status quo, there is no way to avoid this.  We
should not forget that defense budgets, as do all federal budgets, reflect our national priorities
and are arrived at through the political process.  But national security is different.  It is the first
priority of government and first claimant on the nation's resources.  No one would argue that the
allocation process is perfect or that it produces optimal solutions.  Nor should one conclude the
system is broken beyond repair.  The adage about how laws and sausage are made applies no less
to defense budgets and the over-arching national military and national security strategies.
  <P>   Throughout this review, the political process, with all its flaws, is taken as a given and no
criticism of the process participants is intended.  It is assumed that they merely adapt the system
as they find it to their particular role and agenda.  I for one would do no less.

<H4>The Need for a Review and Update of US Military Forces and Strategy</H4>
<P>
"As we restructure American military forces to meet the new threats of the post-Cold War world,
we can responsibly reduce our defense budget.  But lest no one be in any doubt:   The men and
women who serve under the American flag will be the best trained, best equipped, best prepared
fighting force in the world, so long as I am President."14
President William J. Clinton (1993)
 <P>    US military force design and the national security strategy are shaped by the interaction
of a number of influences, most of which defy precise identification.  These influences can be
classified into three general categories: international political and military developments,
domestic priorities, and technological advancements.15  By the time of the 1992 presidential
election, events in each of these categories, but especially in the first two, contributed to the
notion that a complete rethinking of the strategy, design, and role for the US military was needed
for the post-Cold War era.
 <P>    With the tearing down of the Berlin Wall in 1989, German reunification and Soviet
Union disintegration, the Cold War ended at about the time the 1992 presidential election
campaign began.  The euphoria of victory in the Persian Gulf quickly faded under the clouds of a
lingering domestic economic recession.  America once again wanted to turn inward, to largely
ignore world events and to focus on problems at home.  As America struggled economically,
many saw the end of the Cold War as an opportunity to harvest a "peace dividend" by
substantially reducing the Cold War defense structure and applying the savings to more pressing
domestic priorities.  
 <P>    President Bush started the post-Cold War military restructuring and defense budget
downsizing in a major policy address delivered August 2, 1990 - ironically the same day that
Saddam Hussein seized Kuwait.16  Implementation of the Bush plan had to wait for more than a
year as America fought its first post-Cold War conflict, conducted its largest deployment since
the end of the Vietnam War and largest mobilization of reserve forces since Korea.
 <P>    The Bush plan, known as the "Base Force," called for a reduction of approximately
twenty-five percent of military forces and defense budgets through the end of the decade.  Table
1 below compares the 1990 Cold War force and the proposed Base Force.  The Base Force
recommendations pleased no one.  The military felt betrayed that the reward for Cold War
victory was a rapid restructuring and a thankless transition to irrelevance.  Liberals eager to
siphon off large budget authority for favored domestic initiatives argued that the cuts didn't go
far enough.  Conservatives, the most faithful backers of large defense budgets during the Cold
War, saw the Base Force as dismantling the military which would diminish America's leadership
in the world.17

     One of the harshest Base Force critics was House Armed Services Committee Chairman
Les Aspin (D-WI).  Aspin, a defense intellectual, saw the Base Force as little more than an
across-the-board reduction of the existing force, not a thorough rethinking of defense needs for a
new era.18  Presidential candidate Bill Clinton agreed.  In a speech to his alma mater,
Georgetown University, in the months after the US victory in the Gulf, Clinton rejected the Bush
Base Force and pledged to "restructure our military forces for a new era."19
 <P>    The 1992 Presidential election turned on domestic politics.  In the aftermath of the
Persian Gulf War, President George Bush achieved the highest public opinion approval ratings of
any President since pollsters began to calculate approval ratings sixty odd years ago.  An
incredible ninety-one percent of the American people approved of the way he was performing his
duties.20  Twenty months later they voted him from office as challenger Bill Clinton delivered a
message of domestic focus and economic regeneration.  A sign on the wall opposite Clinton's
desk in his Little Rock, Arkansas campaign office summed up the campaign's theme: "The
Economy, Stupid."21
 <P>    Shortly after the inauguration, Clinton's new Secretary of Defense, Les Aspin, established
the Bottom-Up Review steering committee to conduct a "comprehensive review of the nation's
defense strategy, force structure, modernization, infrastructure, and foundations."22  Under
Secretary of Defense John Deutch chaired the group with representatives from the Office of the
Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the unified and specified commands, each of the
uniform military services, and other defense agencies.23  Six months later, the findings of the
review were released in a nationally televised press conference.

<H4>The Bottom-Up Review Methodology</H4>

     The Report on the Bottom-Up Review details the forces, programs and defense budgets in
a multi-year plan and shifts the focus of US national security away from containment of the
Soviet Union toward the new dangers of the post-Cold War era.  To reach its recommendations, 
the BUR employed a six step methodology, as shown in Figure 1.

<P>
    In step one, the steering group analyzed changes in the post-Cold War international and
military environment and identified the new dangers the US will face.  These new dangers fall
into four broad categories: dangers posed by the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other
weapons of mass destruction, as well as the dangers associated with the large arsenal that
remains in the former Soviet Union; dangers to democracy and reform in Eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union; economic dangers to the US economy; and, regional dangers posed by the
threat of large-scale aggression by regional powers.24
  <P>   Having described the dangers the US faces in the post-Cold War era, several strategies
were considered.  Guiding this discussion was the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommendation during
the Bush Administration that the minimum capability that the US should maintain would be the
ability to fight two geographically dispersed conflicts that occur close in time.25  The two policy
choices given final consideration called for a military strategy of either "win-win" or
"win-hold-win."  Under a "win-hold-win" military strategy, the US would shape its force for the
most demanding potential conflict and maintain the ability to decisively engage and defeat an
aggressor while conducting an economy of force operation in a subsequent theater, should the
need arise.26  For example, should a conflict breakout in Korea after US forces were committed
to the Persian Gulf, the US would deploy air and naval forces to the Korean theater of operations
to stabilize the conflict.  After decisively defeating the aggression in the first operation, forces
would be disengaged and redeployed to the second conflict to reinforce ongoing US and allied
operations.  This "win-hold-win" strategy is reminiscent of the US strategy during World War II
in which priority was given to the defeat of Germany.27  Critics argued that "win-hold-win" was
too risky and might actually encourage aggression in the second region once US troops were
committed to the first operation.28  The BUR committee adopted instead a strategy of "win-win"
in which the US would maintain sufficient forces to fight two conflicts that occur nearly
simultaneously.  Little analysis was provided to support of this choice other than the JCS
Chairman's view that such a capability was the minimum required in order to be considered a
great power.29
<P>     The BUR gives two reasons for adopting a "win-win" strategy.  First, if US forces were
committed to one MRC, another hostile power could take advantage of US involvement and
attack its neighbor, "especially if it were convinced the United States and its allies did not
possess the requisite military capability or will to oppose it."  Second, maintaining the capability
to engage two conflicts would provide "a hedge against the possibility that a future adversary
might one day confront us with a larger-than-expected threat."30  Surprisingly however, the
BUR concluded that the US must retain sufficient forces to not only fight and win both conflicts
simultaneously, but maintain the ability to fight them both unilaterally, if necessary.31
<P>     The analytical tool used by BUR planners to calculate total force requirements in steps
three and four of their methodology was a combination of scenarios and building blocks.  Using
the scenario method, the analyst determines the missions the forces are expected to perform and
their probability of occurrence.  Using the building block method, the analyst designs a force to
accomplish the mission described by the scenario.  By fitting various scenarios together based
upon their probability of both individual and simultaneous occurrence, the analyst builds a total
force that eliminates, to the acceptable degree of risk, extraneous forces.  For example, a force
structure building block may contain units necessary to conduct water crossing operations.  Such
units are normally equipped with assault bridging and other floatation equipment.  A scenario
based in Europe with its frequent rivers and streams would require a number of units with this
capability.  A desert based scenario such as a Persian Gulf state would not.  If the analyst
determines the most demanding combination of requirements to be one European and one
Persian Gulf conflict occurring simultaneously, only one set of capabilities to conduct water
crossing operations need be maintained.  In this manner needless duplication can be eliminated
from the force and resources diverted to higher priority requirements.
   <P>  Four broad categories of potential operations were evaluated to determine the design of
the BUR force.  These were: major regional conflicts; smaller-scale conflicts such as peace
enforcement; overseas presence of US forces to conduct normal peacetime operations; and,
deterrence of attacks using weapons of mass destruction against either US territory or forces, or
the territory and forces of our allies.  The BUR recognized that the actual list of US operations
includes other missions such as humanitarian assistance and counterdrug operations but
concluded that projected forces are capable of accomplishing these missions in addition to any
warfighting requirement and that dedicated forces need not be provided.32
 <P>    To construct the force building block the BUR used several scenarios depicting possible
future conflicts with potential Third World powers.  Both scenarios assumed a similar enemy
operation: an armor-heavy, combined-arms offensive against the outnumbered forces of a
neighboring state.  To respond to this aggression, US forces had to deploy to the region,
supplement local forces, halt the aggression, and defeat the enemy force.  Both scenarios
assumed that US forces would fight as part of a US led coalition.33  Using Operation Desert
Storm as the model, the BUR estimated the minimum forces required for each regional conflict
as: 4 to 5 Army divisions; 4 to 5 Marine Brigades; 10 Air Force fighter wings; up to 100 Air
Force heavy bombers armed with conventional munitions; 4 to 5 Navy aircraft carrier battle
groups; and, unspecified numbers of special operations forces.  To arrive at the BUR total force,
planners doubled the force package for one MRC, and added a margin of safety based on
"military judgment" to arrive at the force size shown in Table 2.34

<P>
     BUR critics argue that the Desert Storm model is inappropriate for force planning and
skews the results to too large a force.  During Desert Storm planners could draw on the entire US
force despite the existing two war strategy, resulting in the use of far more force than necessary. 
To justify a force of the size used in Desert Storm as the model for future conflicts, planners
must first demonstrate that the Desert Storm results could not have been produced with fewer
ground, air and naval forces.35  Further, the BUR does not assume allies or coalitions in its force
design, but requires the capability for the US to act unilaterally.  Short of a highly unlikely direct
attack of US territory, it is inconceivable that the US would fight a major conflict unilaterally.  In
the Persian Gulf War, the US had thirty-seven coalition partners that provided more than a
quarter million troops.36  Recent operations in which the US did act unilaterally, such as
Grenada (1983) and Panama (1989), do not qualify as major conflicts.  
   <P>  By choosing to maintain the capacity to act alone, the US encourages other nations to
shirk their responsibility for collective security and goads our potential adversaries into building
up their militaries.37  Neither of these results enhance US national security.  Worse yet,
assuming no increase in resources available for defense, maintaining a force larger than
necessary reduces funds available for modernization, training, infrastructure, war reserve
stockpiles, and for new policy initiatives such as the Army's prepositioned forces afloat. 
Underfunding each of these areas reduces the readiness and capability of the force.38
  <P>   The resulting policy options were to either: (1) downsize the total force; (2) accept the
degradation of readiness and the gradual antiquation of the force; or (3) to increase defense
funding.  In building its multi-year defense plan, the administration choose option two as shown
in table 3 below.  However, these absolute numbers mask the impact on individual service
budgets.  For example, when the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, the Army allocated 24 percent
of its budget to research, development and procurement programs.  Last year, it was down to 15
percent.  This year, the Army will spend only 13 percent of its budget on modernization.39 
These trends clearly indicate that the technological lead that US forces demonstrated in the
Persian Gulf War is in danger of being lost.

<P>
     In summary, the BUR steering committee's methodology appears logical but is not
supported by careful analysis.  As will be described in subsequent sections, the forces selected to
implement the chosen strategy do not correlate with the dangers identified for the post-Cold War
era.  The strategy itself is for the most unlikely scenario, rather than either the most dangerous or
most likely threat to US national security.  The building blocks for the two MRC requirement are
too large to both maintain and modernize, 
leaving no resources available for other defense requirements such as modernization of
transportation assets necessary to deploy the forces in a timely manner.40  Lastly, when each
step is combined to build the multi-year defense plan, the results are an underfunded, aging shell,
with more characteristics in common with the "hollow force" of the 1970s than the
technologically superior force of the Persian Gulf War.

<H4>The Policy Process</H4>
<P>
     In testimony before the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee on March 1, 1994,
Secretary of Defense William J. Perry summed up the nature of the defense challenge:
You can look at this, and if you do not like the strategy and want to change it, then that will lead
to a different force structure.  If you do not like the force structure and want to change it, it will
lead you to different costs.  If you do not like the cost and want to change it, then you have to go
back and change either the force structure or the strategy. My point, though, is that they are
interconnected, and you cannot change one without changing the other...41
 <P>    Secretary Perry is absolutely correct.  Force structure, military strategy and defense
budgets are interconnected and inseparable.  A change in one parameter necessitates a change in
another, or both.  The point here is that to implement a strategy requires developing a certain
force design which dictates a cost which established a budget and a military capability.  This
capability tells the strategist what is possible given a budget, structure and strategy.  Once any of
these three components is fixed, it largely determines the range of the other components.42  It
makes a great deal of difference which of the three components is set first - most often it is the
budget.  Even during wartime the defense budget must compete with other items in the budget. 
In peacetime, one year's defense budget rarely differs more than a few percentage points from
each other.43
 <P>    The National Security Strategy is developed by the President and his advisors, including
the Secretaries of Defense and State, the National Security Advisor and the various economic
advisors to the president.  It is a civilian, as opposed to military, plan integrating politics,
economics, and military goals and objectives.  It serves as a statement of the nation's enduring
goals, interests, and values.  Reflecting its origins as a political document, it is widely accepted
that the national security strategy is written in broad conceptual terms to minimize controversy,
maximize public support and provide the widest latitude for the administration to implement
policy during an unforeseen crisis.44
  <P>   From guidance contained in the National Security Strategy and the Defense Planning
Guidance, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff prepares the National Military Strategy,
which identifies the objectives, tasks, posture, and the size and capability of military forces.45 
The Defense Planning Guidance is prepared by the Office of the Secretary of Defense and links
the planning and programming used by the Joint Staff and the military services.46  Similarly,
each of the services 
prepares their respective plan based on the National Military Strategy and the resources
available.  This process, which begins with the National Security Strategy and ends with the
budget allocation, is from the "top-down."47

 <P>    The "bottom-up" approach is the reverse of what most security planners would prefer. 
For them, strategy should be derived first, from the "top-down."  The planner looks at the world
and asks the question, "What are America's goals and objectives and what are the obstacles,
(political, military, economic) to our achieving these goals and objectives?"
 <P>    The real world of security planning is neither bottom-up nor top-down, nor should it be. 
The bottom-up approach, which is essentially budget constrained force planning, takes the pot of
money, divides it up, sees what forces you get, tests it against potential threat scenarios, and then
adjusts for other desired outcomes like increased readiness.48  Critics argue such an approach
places too much emphasis on restricting costs and in the process diminishes the role of strategy. 
It is too much into the "green eyeshade" mentality of the "bean counters" who know the cost of
everything but the value of nothing.  It is a process that focuses on the here and now and neglects
the future.
 <P>    The top down approach places too much emphasis on strategy and perceived threats,
resulting in too many forces and unachievable or unsustainable budgets.  The top-down security
planner tends to see danger behind every bellicose word and is prone to over estimate the
capability of potential foes.  Just as the bottom-up planner is too much accountant and too little
visionary strategist, the top-down planner forgets the reality of the budget battle.  Regardless of
the abundance or absence of danger to US security interests, the fact remains that a dollar spent
on national security is a dollar not available for other budget priorities.  Governing is about
making choices.  What the American people demand is that those choices reflect our values and
priorities.
    <P> As will be explained, the Bottom-Up Review was a budget driven process from the
beginning.  The committee's name was chosen to express the idea of an analysis of security needs
without pre-conceived ideas with literally everything subject to review and negotiation.  The
resulting strategy was to be built like a house, starting with the foundation and a plan and
working up from there.  It didn't turn out that way.  The BUR turned out to be a familiar,
budget-constrained force planning exercise.

<H4>Campaign Politics</H4>
<P>
"No wonder Americans hate politics when, year in and year out, they hear politicians make
promises that won't come true because they don't even mean them - campaign fantasies that win
elections but don't get nations moving again."49
Presidential Candidate Bill Clinton (1992)
<P>
     President Bush enjoyed a good relationship with the military throughout his presidency. 
No doubt his own military service as the Navy's youngest bomber pilot during World War II
contrasted favorably with the public image of a young Bill Clinton avoiding military service
during the Vietnam War.  Both men are products of their own generation, facing a different war,
different public attitudes, and not surprisingly making different choices.  None of this however,
played much of a role in the 1992 presidential election.  The electorate largely ignored both
candidates personal history and focused on the economic crisis and the direction America was
heading.
 <P>    Clinton's relationship with the military was never strong.  There was more to it than
disagreement over service during Vietnam.  Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, Commentator
Pat Buchanan, former Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and a host of others successfully avoided
Vietnam-era service, yet maintained positive relationships with the military.  Besides, with the
notable exception of the senior leadership, only a relatively small percentage of the military still
on active duty had seen service in Vietnam themselves.  Most were simply too young.  Whatever
its basis, the military, by and large, did not hold Governor Clinton in high regard.  Not
surprisingly, Clinton reciprocated by showing little interest in things military, preferring the
more familiar arena of domestic politics. 
  <P>   There are often several choices between defense contractors for the acquisition of a major
weapons system.  Choosing between building a nuclear attack submarine at the Newport News
Shipbuilding Company in Newport News, Virginia, or at the General Dynamics' Electric Boat
Division in Groton, Connecticut, has significant domestic political ramifications.  This
significance was not lost on either presidential candidate as each advocated the procurement of
particular weapons systems that had more to do with advancing election prospects than national
security objectives.  In the weeks before the election, President Bush approved selling Taiwan
150 advanced F-16 fighters made in his adopted home state of Texas, a state critical to his
reelection.50  Similarly, Clinton endorsed the $2.4 billion Seawolf submarine made in Groton,
Connecticut and the V-22 Osprey, tilt-rotor wing aircraft, made in Pennsylvania and Texas.  The
Bush Defense Department had earlier tried to kill both the Seawolf51 and the V-22,52 but in one
of the more notable campaign flip-flops, Vice President Dan Quayle announced Bush's support
for the $25 billion V-22 only 10 days before the election.53
  <P>   Other domestic issues relating to the military surfaced during the campaign, the most
notable of which was the military exclusion policy for homosexuals.  Not surprisingly, both
candidates were polar opposites on the issue with Bush resisting change and Clinton advocating
non-discrimination.  This issue itself played a relatively minor role in the campaign but created a
firestorm of controversy shortly thereafter.  In his first post-election address on Veteran's Day
1992, only a week after his election, President-elect Clinton acknowledged his intent to comply
with his campaign promise to lift the ban on gays serving in the military. Although he avoided
the gay issue in his remarks to an audience of uniformed and retired officers, the President-elect
strongly reaffirmed his campaign pledge afterward, saying, "I don't think (sexual) status alone, in
the absence of some destructive behavior, should disqualify people."54
 <P>    Conservatives were outraged.  Discussion of Clinton's pledge began to dominate and then
to drown out other domestic agenda items.  The President-elect appeared genuinely surprised at
the depth of the opposition.  Georgia Senator Sam Nunn, the Senate's leading defense expert
broke with Clinton over the issue and publicly expressed doubt about the president-elect's ability
to win congressional approval for a policy change.  As Clinton assumed office in January 1993,
he was faced with the dilemma of breaking a widely reported campaign promise or further
alienating both the military and powerful forces within his own party, such as Sam Nunn.55
   <P>  President Clinton's campaign pledges to restructure the military, cut defense spending,
support particular weapons systems that many considered Cold War relics, and to remove
barriers to gays serving in the military, combined with an already rocky relationship with the
military to set the stage for the Bottom-Up Review.  What proved to be at stake was much more
than just good or bad relations with the military or gay rights organizations.  As the Defense
Department launched the bottom-up strategic analysis of security needs for the post-Cold War
era, nothing less than the domestic political agenda of the new administration was weighing in
the balance.
 <P>    When Candidate Bill Clinton made the remarks at the beginning of this section, two
months before the 1992 election, he was reminding voters that George Bush said "Read my lips,
no new taxes" in 1988 and went on to negotiate a 1990 budget deal with $146 billion in new
taxes.  As it turned out, Clinton was painting himself into a similar corner that would threaten his
entire domestic political agenda during the early days of his administration.
 <P>    The president's number one priority was to reinvigorate the economy.56  Even before
taking office, Clinton hosted a two day economic summit in Little Rock and promised to "focus
like a laser" on the economy and to cut the deficit in half by 1996.57  To accomplish these
objectives would require an united administration, wide public and bi-partisan congressional
support.  This would not be easy for a president elected by only 43 percent of the popular vote. 
The immediate problem was that the "gays in the military" issue was dominating the agenda and
Clinton had already backed away from fulfilling other campaign pledges such as the middle-class
tax cut.  Breaking the tax cut pledge was argued as an economic necessity and responsible
leadership since deficit projections had worsened since Clinton first made the tax cut pledge.58 
No similar easy out was available on the gay issue.  The President had the authority to
unilaterally lift the ban though Congress could intervene and write the ban into law.  Either way,
Clinton was obliged to act and could not afford to be perceived as abandoning other campaign
pledges.
 <P>    Nine days into the new administration, Secretary of Defense Les Aspin asked for six
months to work out a compromise policy that could be supported by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and
would not be overturned by congressional action.59  This move bought the administration
valuable time to refocus the political agenda on the domestic economy.  In reality however, the
six month delay in resolving the issue only served to create a confluence of events that would
further weaken the administration's attempt to reform the military for the post-Cold War era.  The
six month delay in resolving the gay policy meant the issue would resurface at the same time the
Defense Department was to announce the results of the Bottom-Up Review.
  <P>   During the 1992 presidential campaign, Candidate Bill Clinton pledged to "restructure
our military forces for a new era."60  In his first State of the Union address, only weeks after
taking office, President Clinton pledged to "responsibly reduce the defense budget" and that the
US military would remain "the best trained, best equipped, best prepared fighting force in the
world."61   Even without the gay controversy, fulfilling these and other pledges would not be
easy.  With the priority on stimulating the economy, cuts to defense could be counterproductive. 
Reducing the deficit probably requires an equal reduction in defense spending.  Building
expensive new weapons systems requires budget increases as does maintaining readiness and
modernization programs.  Abandoning weapons projects pledged during the campaign risked
further alienating an already suspicious military and also alienating key congressional supporters. 
Restructuring the military, especially in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf War, could place more
emphasis on expensive, high tech equipment, resulting in a smaller, but more expensive military
force.

<P>

 <I>Table 4</I>
<P>     Table 4 shows an itemization of several of the more prominent pledges made by President
Clinton during the campaign.  In the early days of the administration, much public attention was
focused on campaign promises and it was important that the new president not be perceived as
abandoning his promises as soon as the election was over.  While it is not possible to fulfill all
the pledges, it was more important that promises remain unfulfilled rather than broken.  The right
side of the table lists domestic promises and represents the administration's higher priorities.  The
left side were important to the extent that they helped accomplish items on the domestic
agenda.62
<P>     To sort out these conflicting priorities, Secretary Aspin established the Bottom-Up
Review (BUR) steering group in March 1993 and appointed Under Secretary of Defense John
Deutch as chairman.  The BURs mission was clear enough: to conduct a "comprehensive review
of the nation's defense strategy, force structure, modernization, infrastructure, and
foundations."63  To insure consensus, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, and each of the services provided steering group representatives.
<P>     Search for a new strategic concept was short-lived. Rather than providing a strategic
vision for security policy in the 21st Century, the BUR bought the new administration a truce
with the military at the cost of "the peace dividend" and the abandonment of more radical reform. 
The BUR report endorses a limited, near term plan to refight simultaneous Persian Gulf Wars
with a downsized military that in all relevant respects resembled the force then in existence.  Not
surprisingly, the BUR also broke with previous Defense policy and provided a strategic
justification for the Seawolf submarine and V-22 Osprey campaign promises.64
<P>     True to its name, the Bottom-Up Review started with administration budget numbers and
from that, derived a force and strategy.  In the end, far from making deep cuts in defense, the
BUR cut less than 7% off the Bush plan, a reduction of $91 billion over five years in a $1.325
trillion program.65  Even though Secretary Aspin explicitly denied that BUR was constrained
budgeting, the fact remains that the Administration's budget numbers were released several
months before completion of the Bottom-Up Review66
<P>     The BUR steering group could not have done differently.  To ask the services to advocate
deep defense cuts is no less difficult that asking Congress to pass campaign finance reform or to
institute term limits.  Reform, if it comes, will likely be forced from the outside.  For the Clinton
Administration, a truce with the military would quell the gays in the military controversy and
allow the President to bring his domestic agenda to the attention of the American people at the
relatively modest cost of a percent or two of the federal budget.  Besides, hadn't Bush
Administration CIA Director Robert Gates testified in the aftermath of the Persian Gulf War that
he "did not expect threats to the US to arise within the next decade?"  In that case, it really didn't
matter what the military did during Clinton's term of office.
<P>     American University professor Jeff Fishel summarized the new president's dilemma in his
book Presidents & Promises : "Incumbent presidents face new issues, new problems, new
contingencies that cannot be anticipated from the campaign.  They must be willing to change, to 
compromise, to be flexible about some of their campaign promises; if they are unwilling to alter
their course, and unable to persuade voters that it is essential to do so, they will down their party
and themselves at the next election."67
<P>     It was a simple choice for the new president and his secretary of defense.  They could
stick with campaign pledges, fight with the Joint Chiefs of Staff over the defense budget and
alienate key congressional supporters.  Or, they could seek a compromise that would put military
issues out of the public eye and allow the administration to promote its domestic agenda. 
President Clinton rightly chose the latter.

<H4>Bureaucratic Politics</H4>
<P>


     According to Graham T. Allison, most policy analysts think about and explain
governmental behavior in terms of the rational actor model in which policy choices are arrived at
through a deliberate and logical process to achieve given objectives.68  In other words, rational
people clearly identify their objectives, the options available, and the likely consequences of each
alternative choice before reaching a decision.  While the rational actor model can usefully
describe many defense decisions, it does not appear to work well in explaining the BUR
recommendations.  For example, during the first step in the BUR methodology, four dangers for
the post-Cold War era were identified.  A rational actor would be expected to design a force to
counter the specific threats posed by each of these dangers.  The BUR did not do this.  Instead,
by recommending a large force capable of unilateral action, the BUR may have created a fifth
danger by simultaneously encouraging our allies to shirk their defense responsibilities and by
challenging potential adversaries to build up their forces.  Likewise, choosing a force too large to
both keep ready and to modernize reduces over time the American technological advantage.  As
other forces approach US capabilities, they may feel up to the challenge of confronting US
forces.
 <P>    Recognizing that the rational actor model does not describe every situation, Allison
offered two other frames of reference: an organizational process model and a bureaucratic
politics model.  The organizational process model is attributed to Herbert Simon and is based on
the concept of bounded rather than comprehensive rationality.  It is characterized by factoring or
splitting up problems, the parceling out of problem parts to various organizational units, and the
search for satisfactory rather than optimal solutions.69  The organizational process model
describes the behavior of organizations solving short-run problems rather than long-range issues
and appears no better at describing the BUR results than the rational actor model.
 <P>    Allison's third model, the bureaucratic politics model, builds on the organizational
process model, but instead of assuming control by leaders at the top, the bureaucratic politics
model hypothesizes intensive competition among the decision-making units, and governmental
policies are the result of bargaining among the components of a bureaucracy.  The players are
guided by no consistent strategic master plan, but rather by conflicting conceptions of national,
bureaucratic, and personal goals.70
 <P>    The bureaucratic politics model provides a better explanation and insight into the BUR
policy recommendations.  For example, the size of the BUR force is better explained by
bureaucratic bargaining than by the rational design to counter perceived threats.  One would
expect that in a situation of bureaucratic bargaining among equal policy actors, for the result of
negotiations to be, not a radical restructuring but marginal change.  As identified previously, the
BUR force closely resembles the Cold War force, only smaller.  This downsizing can be
attributed to the bureaucratic negotiations that prevented deeper cuts or more radical redesign. 
 <P>    Considering that the administration budget numbers were made public months before the
Bottom-Up Review completed its work, it is logical to assume that in the choice between
strategy, forces, and budgets, that the budget was set first.  Following a bureaucratic politics
paradigm, you can predict that budget allocation among competing actors would remain fairly
constant, in spite of the disappearance of key missions.  The Air Force's strategic missile and
long range bomber, the Navy's nuclear submarine, and the Army's European focus arguably were
all in decline.  Yet, the way the budget pie was allocated between services changed very little. 
For example, when the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, the services' portion of the Defense
budget was allocated as follows: Army, 28.8 percent; Navy and Marine Corps, 36.1 percent; and
Air Force, 35.1 percent.  The post-BUR 1995 budget allocation was virtually unchanged with
28.4 percent to the Army, 36.7 percent to the Navy and 34.8 percent to the Air Force.71 
Likewise, even though force structure cuts are required because of the declining budget pie,
bureaucratic politics would predict no appreciable change in the role or mission of the individual
services.  For example, you would not predict the Army to assume all ground combat roles from
the Marine Corps or for the Air Force to assume all close air support for ground forces, even
though these issues are frequently discussed.
  <P>   Following the parameters of the bureaucratic politics model, we can hypothesize different
objectives for the BUR steering committee than those articulated by Secretary Aspin.  These
objectives include: to gain consensus among the military services, to design a force to fit within
the overall administration budget constraints, and to provide strategic justification for
compliance with administration campaign pledges.  From this perspective, the BUR
accomplished exactly what was intended.  Also, it explains why, in spite of its obvious
shortcomings, the Administration rejects all suggestions to change the BUR.

<H4>The Four Dangers and US Defense Priorities
</H4>
<P>
"For the first time in over half a century, no single great power, or coalition of  powers, poses a
"clear and present danger" to the national security of the United States."72
<BR>                                       John Lewis Gaddis (1991)

<P>
     The Bottom-Up Review identified four "new dangers" that the US will face as a result of
the end of the Cold War era, as illustrated in Table 5 below. In failing to reinvent the military to
meet future US security needs, the BUR instead chose to reinvent the threat to fit the existing
military.  Three of these four "new dangers" are familiar restatements of old threats.  The US has
long focused on the dangers of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), on
domestic economic concerns, and on deterring regional aggression.  The only new threat is that
posed by the failure of the democratization movement in Eastern Europe and the republics of the
former Soviet Union.  Should the move towards democracy fail in these states, an authoritarian
power opposed to the United States could seize power and resurrect Cold War relationships.

<P>
    <I> Source: Report on the Bottom-Up Review, p.1.
    <BR>
Table 5</I>
<P>
     Surprisingly, and largely missed by the BUR, three of the four "new dangers" actually are
an argument for reducing defense spending and reorienting military forces onto other national
priorities.  Only the threat posed by regional aggression is a valid argument for maintaining
military preparedness and will be addressed in detail in the following section.  Each of the other
dangers challenge security planners to reorient defense expenditures away from military structure
into programs directly aimed at reducing the specific risk posed by a particular danger.
 <P>    The BUR makes no mention of how US forces will deal with a hostile regional power
armed with nuclear weapons.  But unlike a conventional threat, a nuclear equipped regional
power would pose a serious danger to US vital interests.  The spread of nuclear, biological and
chemical weapons has long concerned US security planners. In a recent television interview,
Senator Sam Nunn expressed his belief that, "we have to recognize that the number one security
challenge the United States has now and probably for years ahead is to prevent the proliferation
of these weapons of mass destruction, whether chemical, biological, or nuclear, and scientific
knowledge of how to make these..."73  Accepting Senator Nunn's assertion that proliferation of
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons is our most serious threat, the BUR focus on regional
conflicts to the virtual exclusion of other threats is short-sighted.  If so, the BUR is in good
company.
  <P>   The disintegration of the Soviet Union left in its wake fifteen successor states, four armed
with nuclear weapons: Russia, Belarus, Kazahkstan, and Ukraine.  Nearly four years ago,
Congress passed the Nunn-Lugar74 bill to provide US assistance in denuclearizing and
demilitarizing the former Soviet Union.  After a slow start, the program is making progress. 
Because implementation has only just started, it is difficult to gauge how effective the program
will be.  Currently, the United States has reached agreement on 38 projects with the four nuclear
successor states75  These projects are intended to help the dismantling of  strategic and chemical
weapons, protecting, controlling, and accounting for fissile material; and providing new
employment for former weapons scientist.  Last April it was reported that all nuclear warheads in
Kazakhstan had been removed and the all nuclear warheads would be removed from Belarus by
the end of 1995.76
  <P>   In spite of these successes, funding for Nunn-Lugar is threatened.  The Administration's
1996 budget request of $371 million was cut nearly in half to $200 million by the Republican
controlled House of Representatives.77  This reasoning is penny-wise and dollar-foolish.  In
today's dollars, the United States spent over twelve trillion dollars on defense during the Cold
War when the greatest threat to US security was Soviet nuclear weapons.  Today, those same
weapons still pose the most serious threat to US survival.  There is an opportunity to help remove
these weapons for pennies on the dollar of what it cost to build them or to defend against them. 
Rather than aggressively pursuing this opportunity to increase our own security, it is being
viewed by many as foreign aid and therefore, a prime target for budget cutters.  With defense
budgets exceeding $250 billion a year, the $200 million appropriated for Nunn-Lugar represents
about seven hours of the total annual defense budget.
  <P>   The BUR identifies the US economy as "the final - and in the post-Cold War period,
perhaps most important - set of dangers that US strategy must confront."78  To meet these
dangers to American prosperity, the BUR identifies the five objectives shown in Table 6 below:
<P>
<B>National Economic Objectives</B>
<P>

<UL><LI>Redirect resources to investments that improve both our defense posture and our competitive position economically.
<LI>Facilitate reinvestment that allows defense industries to shift to nondefense production.
<LI>Support the development of dual-use technologies and encourage the freer flow of technology between the military and civilian sectors.
<LI>Use our long-standing security relationships with key allies and partners to build a bridge to greater economic cooperation and to sustain and enhance global free trade.
<LI>Actively assist nations in making the transition from controlled to market economies.
</UL>
<I>Source: Les Aspin, Report on the Bottom-Up Review, (Washington, DC: DoD, Oct. 1993), p.11.<BR>
Table 6</I>
<P>

     Economic strategy is properly a component of the National Security rather than National
Military Strategy.  The recognition of economic security dangers by the BUR steering group
reinforces the inter-connectivity of politics, economics, and military policy in the formulation of
a national grand strategy.  Each of these economic objectives is an argument against the BUR
emphasis on maintaining a large post-Cold War military structure.  For example, the first
objective is to increase economic competitiveness.  Harvard's Joseph S. Nye, Jr., earlier a Clinton
Administration Assistant Secretary of Defense, wrote in his 1990 best seller, Bound To Lead,
that, "whereas 95 percent of Japanese students complete high school, only 75 percent of
Americans do so."79  Yet, the Japanese spent only 1.1 percent of their GDP on defense in 1994,
compared to about 4.1 percent for the US.80  A competitive economic policy would shift
resources to programs similar to those of our economic competitors.
<P>     If the goal of our economic policy is to increase long-term GNP, reductions in defense
spending could be used to fund carefully chosen federal investments.  Research has shown that
spending on such public facilities as roads and ports, and on education and training, can enhance
productivity in the private sector.  Alternatively, long-term GNP could be increased by using the
funds to reduce the federal deficit.  That would in turn increase national savings, resulting in
lower interest rates, higher levels of domestic investments, and less foreign indebtedness.  The
Administration could also choose to return the savings to the taxpayer in the form of either a
general tax rate reduction or a program of tax incentives meant to stimulate investment or
research and development activities.  All three of these choice yield long-term returns -- a higher
level of consumption and, in the first two cases, higher productivity for the US economy, fueled
by increased domestic investment.81
  <P>   The third danger facing the US in the post-Cold War era is that posed by the failure of
democratic reform in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.  In the long term the
proliferation of democracy - particularly in Russia and Ukraine - will enhance US security, both
economically and militarily by precluding a return to Cold War style relations.  In turn, the
establishment of democratic values will profoundly reduce the chances of conflict.  Democratic
reforms are the best long-term answer to the aggressive nationalism and ethnic hatred unleashed
by the end of the Cold War.  However, under current plans, we will spend about six times as
much maintaining our forces in western Europe as we will in providing aid to eastern Europe.
 <P>    In summary, the BUR articulates four dangers that the United States is facing in the
post-Cold War era.  Each of these four dangers is real and individually pose significant danger to
US security interests.  Collectively they present a monumental challenge to security planners,
Defense, and Administration leadership.  Three of the challenges cannot be effectively
neutralized by increased US military force.  In fact, it is quite probable that military force would
be counterproductive and weaken rather than strengthen the US position.  Current Defense
Department obsession with army divisions and navy aircraft carriers will do nothing to counter
the threat posed by the proliferation of nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons.  A third
Seawolf submarines and twenty more B-2 bombers will not increase American economic
competitiveness.  And certainly, deploying a strategic missile defense will not promote
democracy and free market economics in Eastern Europe and the republics of the former Soviet
Union.  On the contrary, beyond maintaining sufficient military strength to protect our vital
national security interests, excess military spending is a drag on our economy, encourages our
allies to shift the burden of defense our way, and encourages potential enemies to maintain a
larger than necessary force for their own defense.
   <P>     To counter the threat posed by the dangers of proliferation, economic stagnation and
decline, and the failure of democratic reform movements requires the US to develop military and
civilian programs specifically aimed at reducing the specific threat.  The generic, one size fits all,
response of maintaining a large conventional force simply will not address the dangers and will
inevitably result in a more dangerous world.

<H4>The Threat from Regional Powers
</H4>

<P>     Following the Persian Gulf War it is understandable that planners would focus on
regional conflicts.  It is always easier to refight the last war and to plan for the familiar. 
However, the BUR assumptions about future conflict with regional powers is flawed on two
levels.  At the theoretical level, the BUR overestimates the internal stability of regional powers
and their ability for external action while ignoring global trends pressuring all states to
cooperative action.  At a concrete level, the BUR exaggerates the capability of regional military
powers, the unpredictability of regional aggression, the likelihood of simultaneous aggression
and the amount of force the US will require to unilaterally contain future regional aggression.
<P>     The BUR appears to adopt the realist paradigm from international relations theory to
describe the potential for conflict with Third World regional powers.  The basic premises of
realism are that the principal actors in world politics are cohesive states and their primary
concern is to survive external threats to their security.  Cohesive states, the first premise, are a
rarity in the Third World.  Internal threats are often of far greater concern to national leaders than
external threats and internal conflicts occur with greater frequency.  The existence of internal
instability does not preclude external aggression, as the Kurdish problem did not keep Iraq out of
Kuwait, it certainly diminishes the likelihood of such aggression and the resources available
should aggression occur.
 <P>    For the past twenty years, there has been no shortage of traditional interstate rivalries and
conflict in the Third World.  But theories widely used in the developed world are not always
useful for analyzing those struggles.  For example, hegemonic political theories imagine a world
where many states have an appetite for aggression, or could quickly develop one.  But this idea
does not describe Third World reality.  Potential hegemons like Brazil, India and Nigeria remain
potential, not actual hegemons, that have failed to expand their power by conquering weaker
neighbors.
 <P>    Over the past decade, democracy has made major gains in the Third World.  In 1979, 12
of 19 Latin American countries had authoritarian governments.  By 1990, all but Cuba had an
elected president, although a number of governments remained only nominally democratic.  In
Africa, nearly three-quarters of the 47 countries south of the Sahara are in the process of political
liberalization.  In Asia, democracy is making inroads into South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and
the Philippines.82 
 <P>    The BUR expressed the widely embraced view that democracies tend to be more
peaceful.  If so, these trends should reduce conflict between Third World states that are
democratic, while more Third World leaders should face domestic constraints on their ability to
wage war.  With the exception of North Korea, Pentagon planners have not be able to identify a
hostile regional power close to the capabilities that Iraq had in 1990.  Iraq was unique in many
ways, particularly in its military capabilities, its proximity to vital US interests, its opportunity
for successful aggression, and its leader's self-destructive belligerence.  Those Third World
countries that do come close to matching both Iraq's military power and its anti-Western hostility
are balanced by strong neighbors.  Syria is militarily inferior to Israel and faces Turkey and Iraq
on its other borders.  North Korea has a military edge over South Korea but has half its
population and 1/16th its GDP.  Libya is substantially weaker than Egypt; Iran remains
counterbalanced by Iraq and is technologically inferior to both Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf
states in key areas, such as air power.
 <P>    Should aggression occur despite our best diplomatic efforts, there are only a few places in
the world where the US should ever intervene with ground troops: Korea, the Persian Gulf,
Central America, the Caribbean.83   The first two of these meet the BUR definition for a major
regional conflict, while the remaining two, 
even in a worst case scenario, could probably be contained to a lesser regional contingency
requiring substantially fewer troops.  In other words, to justify the large force retained by the
BUR, planners had to assume not only two conflicts simultaneously, but the only two that would
require large amounts of US ground troops.

<H4>The Two Conflict Scenario</H4>
<P>
     To address the threat of regional aggression, the Bottom-Up Review requires that the US
maintain the ability to fight and win two major regional conflicts occurring nearly
simultaneously and, if necessary, to fight unilaterally.84  Why two conflicts?  The requirement
originated from a Joint Chiefs of Staff recommendation during the Bush Administration that
sufficient forces be retained to wage two conflicts at the same time, although it was not
necessarily assumed that aggression would be initiated simultaneously in both regions.85   The
Joint Chiefs viewed regional threats as the principal immediate danger to US security.  Regional
threats could be managed with the existing type and mix of forces available.  Cold War planning
techniques could be easily modified for regional threats.  And most importantly, especially after
the Persian Gulf War, US planners knew how to fight and win against today's regional powers. 
Rather than forecast the future nature of conflict and prepare for the next war, BUR planners are
maintaining forces designed for the last war.86
<P>     From an organizational perspective it is easy to see how BUR planners could be seduced
into this familiar trap.  The threat as we knew it during the Cold War is gone.  While many
regional powers can cause untold misery and mischief, none pose a serious threat to US security
interests in the near term.  The problem of course is that the life of a presidential administration
is four years and the tenure of senior defense officials is often considerably less.  Defense
Department civilian appointees often serve less than two years. In the two years since the BUR
was released, Les Aspin is gone.  BUR steering group chairman John Deutch is gone.  JCS
chairman Colin Powell is gone, as are many others.  The point is that with short tenure, it is
natural for defense officials to focus on near term threats.  The "not on my watch" mentality will
prevent serious focus on longer term threats. 
<P>     The BUR itself provides two justifications for a two conflict requirement.  In a departure
from Cold War planning, neither justification is based on a credible threat to US interests.  North
Korea, Iran, and Iraq just don't measure up to the Cold War threat posed to the US by the Soviet
Union, nor are they combined sufficient to justify retaining a large US military force.  Instead,
planners assumed that a two MRC force was the most that was affordable given projected
budgets.  As one analyst put it, "the Bottom-Up Review does not so much reinvent the military to
meet a changed threat as it reinvents the threat to fit the existing military."87  In light of its
dominant influence in the BUR, this planning requirement requires careful evaluation.
 <P>    The first justification for the two conflict requirement is conventional deterrence: "if we
were to be drawn into a war in response to the armed aggression of one hostile nation, another
could well be tempted to attack its neighbors - especially if it were convinced the United States
and its allies did not possess the requisite military capability or will to oppose it."88   Secretary
of Defense William J. Perry explained:
We believe that neither Iraq nor Iran is capable of putting up a force like Iraq had before Desert
Storm for years to come. ... We never envisioned that we would get involved in two major
regional contingencies.  What we wanted was if we got involved in one, that we had a sufficient
reserve force that nobody would be tempted to take advantage of that opportunity.89   
 <P>    What is the likelihood of a second conflict occurring simultaneously?  If history can be
our guide, it is not very likely.  During the forty-five years of the Cold War, when the US faced a
global rival said to be systematically probing American resolve in the far corners of the earth, we
were never forced to fight two major conflicts at the same time.  Indeed, in all of American
history, we have only fought two simultaneous conflicts once, and that was World War II.  But
even then the US adopted a win-hold-win strategy by prioritizing the defeat of Germany while
conducting a holding action in the Pacific against Japan.
 <P>    Now however, with no identifiable threat, prudence demands that we be prepared to
implement a win-win strategy against potential regional adversaries who are not allied, have no
global pretensions, and pose no threat to the United States or the core industrial areas of our
allies.
  <P>   Of the three major wars that the United States fought since the end of World War II, it is
possible that both Korea and the Persian Gulf War were avoidable had the US made its intentions
clear.  It is possible that Secretary of State Dean Acheson's speech of January 12, 1950, intended
as the enunciation of a new East Asian strategy following the "loss" of China to communism,
was responsible for inviting the North Korean attack on South Korea through its exclusion of
South Korea from the American "defensive perimeter" in the Pacific.90  On July 25, 1990, US
Ambassador to Iraq April Glaspie told Saddam Hussein that the United States had "no opinion
on the Arab-Arab conflicts, like your border disagreement with Kuwait."  Hussein interpreted
Glaspie's diplomatic language as American indifference to his war plans.91  He invaded Kuwait
seven days later.
   <P>  Had Secretary Acheson included Korea in the defensive perimeter and had Ambassador
Glaspie told Saddam Hussein that aggression would necessitate a US response, both conflicts
may have been avoided.  Even if not, a perceived lack of American interest was certainly a
contributing factor to the causes of the conflicts.  From this we can conclude that in addition to
its military capability, history suggests that willingness to defend vital interests may play a
critical role in deterring regional aggression.  Therefore, to prevent future conflicts, the US must
define and clearly articulate its vital interests.92
   <P>  The second justification for the two MRC requirement is to minimize risk: "sizing our
forces for two major regional conflicts provides a hedge against the possibility that a future
adversary might one day confront us with a larger-than-expected threat, and then turn out,
through doctrinal or technological innovation, to be more capable than we expect, or enlist the
assistance of other nations to form a coalition against our interests."93  This appears to be a more
defensible justification.
  <P>   There is probably no way to stop the proliferation of advanced technology weaponry to
future regional aggressors.  The advantage that the US led coalition forces demonstrated in the
Persian Gulf War, therefore, may not be sustainable without significant investment in weapons
research.  However, the BURs conflict scenarios do not envision such an innovative adversary:
instead, the BUR scenarios describe "an armor-heavy, combined arms offensive against the
outnumbered forces of a neighboring state."94  As such, these scenarios do not anticipate any
innovation on the part of a future aggressor but instead reflect standard planning of the Cold War
period.
  <P>   Further, the BUR scenarios do not reflect lessons learned from the Persian Gulf War. 
Clearly, future aggressors will not replicate the Iraqi strategy (massed tank armies are not the
way to take over small countries that happen to be American allies).95  It is far better to launch
ambiguous takeovers behind the smoke screen of liberation movements or uncontrolled dissident
groups or native putsch-makers.  The Indian Minister of Defense hypothesized that the real
lesson of the Persian Gulf War was to "never fight the US without nuclear weapons."96  This
may be so.  How would Saudi Arabia reacted to the prospect of massing US troops within its
border if Iraq had nuclear weapons?  Or, what would have been the Arab community response if
Iraq had used a nuclear weapon against Israel?  
  <P>   There are other lessons of the Persian Gulf War that the BUR ignores.  Certainly, a future
aggressor will know to quickly finish what he starts and not allow the US time to build up forces. 
A future aggressor may also intermingle military operations with its civilian population to limit
the application of US firepower.  Similarly, mining and sabotaging the ports where American
forces disembark can and should be anticipated.  Or, future aggressors many find other ways,
such as Mohamed Farah Aideed demonstrated in Somalia, to engage US forces short of
conventional means.

Table 7
</I>
<P>
     If, as the BUR suggests, a regional power will be more formidable, an "Iraq on
steroids"97 as Andrew Krepinevich describes, it will probably be based on technological
innovation -- a qualitative rather than quantitative force improvement.  None of our potential
adversaries, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Libya, or Cuba, possesses a modern industrial base and none
spends more than $6 billion per year on its military.  As shown in Table 7 below, collectively
these five potential regional adversaries spent less than $15 billion on their military in 1993 -
about five percent of what the US spent.  Each of these countries field forces with dated
equipment, and are largely dependent on imports and external supply.  None poses a military
threat to the American people or to our core industrial or trading partners.  We could respond to
aggression on the part of these potential adversaries at our convenience after rallying
international opinion, gaining UN authority, applying sanctions, mobilizing and training our
reserve forces, building domestic support, and winning congressional authorization.  The bottom
line is that under virtually any conceivable scenario, the one thing US forces have is time. 
During the Cold War, the Selective Service System was tasked to provide the first inductees 13
days after mobilization.  Following the BUR, DoD extended the reporting time to 193 days. 
What this means is that the first draftees would not be required to report for training until more
than six months into a conflict and would not be available as a trained replacement for 12-18
months into a conflict.98
 <P>    The BUR retains a force structure designed for refighting the Persian Gulf War rather
than one adapting to the technologically improved armies of future regional hegemons.  It is
difficult to escape the conclusion that these planning requirements have been invented to justify
the forces and structures we have rather than to cope with the potential threats we face.  This
requirement to wage two conflicts on no notice with an armor-heavy force is the same
assumption as during the Cold War and is not particularly relevant today.  
 <P>         Worse yet, by focusing so heavily on the forces necessary to fight two conflicts
simultaneously, we neglect the fundamental principles of war, resulting in a force with fists of
iron but feet of clay.  During the Cold War, the army maintained 5 1/3 combat divisions on the
ground in Western Europe.  There was no concern about how to get those divisions into the fight,
they were already there.  Replacements and reinforcements would come from the United States
but the US was prepared to resort to nuclear weapons to stop an invasion.  Such a scenario did
not envision a long war, or long world history after that.  The point is that little thought and less
planning went into the deployment of forces from the United States.  All that has changed.  Army
ground forces are now largely stationed within the continental United States and are totally
dependent on Air Force transport and Navy sealift to get them to the distant theater of operations. 
The BUR recognized the need for substantial enhancements to strategic mobility, relying heavily
on DoD's 1991 Mobility Requirements Study.  The problem is that the Mobility Requirements
Study identifies the transport requirements necessary for one conflict, not two nearly
simultaneous conflicts.  The BUR simply assumes that the airlift and sealift will be available for
the second conflict as soon as deployment to the first is complete.
 <P>    A study by the Lockheed Corporation pointed out the fallacy of this logic.  As soon as
forces are deployed to a region, a portion of the transportation assets becomes required to sustain
the force.  As more force is deployed, more transportation is required simply to sustain it. 
Lockheed estimates that even if all BUR recommended enhancements are procured, sustaining
the forces deployed to the first region will reduce the assets available to the second to the point
that the US will only have the ability to deploy and sustain sixty percent of its force to the second
region.  Lockheed further estimates to deploy the BUR force to two regions within the timelines
projected by the BUR will require twice the investment planned for strategic left.99
  <P>   Given all of these considerations, it would seem that the burden of proof for maintaining
a force structure capable of "decisive victory in two nearly simultaneous major regional
conflicts" has yet to be met.100  The time is right for the US to abandon the requirement to fight
two geographically separated conflicts unilaterally and concurrently.
  <P>   As a minimum we know that we tend to deter the wars we plan for and fight the
unexpected war.  Desert Storm Commander General H. Norman Schwarzkopf wrote in his
autobiography: "If someone had asked me on the day I graduated from West Point where I would
fight for my country during my years of service, I'm not sure what I would have said, but I'm
damn sure I would not have said Vietnam, Grenada, and Iraq."  The point is that the more we
focus on a particular threat and bring our resources to bear, the less likely that conflict will even
materialize.  We need not maintain separate forces to deter both an Iraq and a North Korea.  One
force, well trained and modernized, will do the job.
 <P>    Patrick Garrity and Sharon K. Weiner recently summarized the US security challenge as
ceasing to think about justifying military capability:
Primarily in terms of deterring a specific, ill-intentioned adversary.  The central strategic
challenge for the foreseeable future will not be deterrence, but rather fostering political
conditions in which relations among the great industrial powers remain friendly, and preventing
what competition does emerge from spilling over into the military domain.  In many policy areas,
such as supporting peaceful and democratic change in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union, this will not involve US military power.  But the continued existence of substantial US
military capabilities may be essential to reassure other great powers that they need not (re)enter
the military arena in a major way.  This will not be an easy case to make to Congress and the
American people, but it is likely to be more persuasive than the search for nonexistent
threats."101

<H4>Summary</H4>
<P>


     Secretary Aspin established the Bottom-Up Review steering committee to conduct a
"comprehensive review of the nation's defense strategy, force structure, modernization,
infrastructure, and foundations."  Sadly, these high goals were not achieved.  The steering
committee correctly described the post-Cold War environment that the US faces, but proceeded
to propose a military force ill-designed to confront the four dangers identified: proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction; democratic reform in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union;
dangers to the US economy; and, the threat of regional aggressors.  Only the threat posed by
regional aggression is confronted by the BUR force.
<P>     The rational actor and organizational process models of government decision making do
not explain the results of the BUR methodology.  Only the bureaucratic politics model provides
insight into this process.  First however, it is necessary to establish the environment the new
administration faced.  These environmental factors included: the president's preference for
domestic over military policy; the president's already strained relations with the military over his
avoidance of service during the Vietnam War; the congressional, public and Joint Chiefs of Staff
resistance to a change in the gays in the military policy; the pressure to fulfill conflicting
campaign promises; the breaking of campaign promises even before the inauguration; and, the
belief that no threat could endanger the United States within a decade.  Each of these
environmental factors combined to forge a compromise that keeps the military force larger today
than necessary, at the cost of being unable to adequately modernize the force for the future.
 <P>    Viewed from the bureaucratic politics paradigm, the Bottom-Up Review produced a plan
agreeable to the military services and defense supporters in Congress, relegated defense issues to
the back burners to make room for public consideration of domestic agenda items, and initially
kept Defense within administration budget constraints.  While there has been some movement by
both the Clinton Administration and Congress on budget levels, the Bottom-Up
recommendations reflect a consensus acceptable to the parties involved.  Therefore, regardless of
the validity and severity of external criticism, there is no incentive for the Administration to
reject the BUR.

<TITLE>Just What Is This Ball And Triangle Thing?  -- PFF</TITLE>

<h2>Just What Is This Ball And Triangle Thing?</h2>
<P>
<img src="bi.gif"><P>

We're always being asked what our logo represents, so we thought
we'd explain (but, believing in competition as we do, we thought
we'd offer a couple of alternatives -- each one has its own champions
internally).
<P>
<B>It's From the Story of Sisyphus</B>
<ul>
The Greek myth of Sisyphus, who was king of Corinth, holds that
he saw the god Zeus carry off the beautiful maiden Aegina.  Sisyphus
then told Aegina's father what he had witnessed. Enraged with
Sisyphus, Zeus condemned him to Tartarus, where he was compelled
for eternity to roll to the top of a steep hill a stone that always
rolled down again.(1) The struggle for both progress and freedom
is this -- never-ending, difficult, sometimes torturous.  Absent
inspired action, progress is replaced by atrophy.
</ul>
<B>It's From the 1939 World's Fair</B>
<ul>
Dominating the landscape at the New York World's Fair of 1939-1940
were a white obelisk and globe -- the Trylon and Perisphere --
that came to symbolize the meaning of the fair. For a nation just
coming out of a depression, the fair presented its overall theme
-- The World of Tomorrow -- as a very bright one,  through ever
inventive technology, brilliance of industrial and architectural
design, comprehensive planning, scientific progress and the democratic
ideology.  The fair presented a compelling and cohesive vision
of the world that the New Dealers told us they would make -- a
world based in an industrial planning model that now needs replacing.(2)
</ul>
<B>It's From an Economist's Graph</B> 
<ul>
The idea of progress is for obvious reasons associated with the
idea of change, but the two ideas are different.  Things never
stand still but always move ahead.  Yet the world being the way
it is, things rarely stay constant as they move, but progress
or decay, as in the graph below.<br>
<img src="arrows.gif">
<br>
The nature of progress being what it is, you must have a vision
and sense of right and wrong to know where you should be heading.
 From your starting point you must set out to build a better world,
or else you accept decay.  Thus, you must always be pushing to
ensure progress.(3)<br>

<DD>In an attempt to keep Java, Netscape, Windows 95, the Communications Decency Act, the debate over encryption, Pat Buchanan and the rise of the "New Luddites" in perspective, The Progress & Freedom Foundation convened its Aspen Summit '96:  Cyberspace and the American Dream Conference August 4-6.
More than 150 people gathered in Aspen, Colorado, to explore the promise and peril of the Digital Revolution.  "We want to remind ourselves that America's continued progress in the Digital Revolution is not something to take for granted.  Great civilizations sometimes choose paths leading to decay  even, or perhaps especially, in a digital world," said Foundation President Jeffrey A. Eisenach.

<H4>First Panel</H4>
<P><IMG SRC="/pff/asp-pics/society.gif" ALIGN="left">
<DD>David Gergen of U.S. News & World Report moderated a panel discussion on "Shaping American Society for the Digital Age" that featured Philip Burgess of the Center for the New West, Esther Dyson of EDventure Holdings, David Gelernter of Yale University and Heather Higgins of PFF.
<DD>Dyson described how in the digital world people may need to distinguish between public and private persons.  A private person, using encryption technology as a defense mechanism to protect themselves, is ensured of confidentiality in one-to-one communications like e-mail.  However, when one posts information on the Internet for all to see, offers something to sell, or asks for credit to pay bills, that part of their activity becomes public and will require more disclosure and verification.
Gelernter, a Yale University computer scientist and author of 1939:  The Lost World of the Fair, said that America's biggest problems, our failing education system and struggling families, are things computers cannot deal with.  Basically, Gelernter said, we use computers for word processing, data manipulation, information storage and communication.  However, he asked, "compared to Americans in 1939, are we better writers?  More informed?  Better educated?  Richer communicators?"
After the discussion, Senator Bill Bradley (D-NJ) offered "a practical view" on the how the digital revolution is affecting American society.  "When I walk into a labor hall and a union member tells me that he just lost his manufacturing job, what am I supposed to say? 'Great, now you can go get a knowledge job.'"

<H4>Second Panel</H4>
<P>
<DD>A second panel discussion at the Summit, moderated by Peter Huber of the Manhattan Institute, featured author George Gilder, Jerry Jasinowski of the National Association of Manufacturers, Rich Karlgaard of Forbes ASAP and Jay Keyworth of PFF.  Les Vadasz of Intel offered the "practical view" of the technologies creating the new economy.
<DD>After a series of working group sessions on Education, Regulatory Convergence, Intellectual Property, and Privacy and Censorship, the Summit concluded with a debate on if the "Growth of the Internet is a 'Leading Cultural Indicator' of Progress."

<H4>Toffler Explores Political Flexibility</H4>
<P>
<BR>
<DD>"What do Hillary Clinton and Newt Gingrich have in common?" asked author Alvin Toffler as he opened PFF's Aspen Summit '96.  "They both promised revolutionary change  Hillary in health care and Newt more broadly  and both were slapped down," he concluded.
<DD>Toffler's speech, titled "Future Shock in the Present Tense," described how Americans feel battered by the very acceleration of the Information Revolution.  "They want a chance to slow down and <IMG SRC="/pff/asp-pics/toffle.gif" ALIGN="left">catch their breath.  People, including companies, are disoriented and grasp after anything" that seems to offer reassurance.
<DD>The American political system, its very structure, Toffler said, is ultra stable and resists change.  "It punishes change makers like Hillary Clinton and Newt Gingrich."  Toffler explored whether Americans want a political system that is more flexible and thus might better adjust to the changes in society being engendered by the Information Revolution.  With too many alienated people, Toffler wondered if more flexibility in America's political structure might be needed to avoid violence.
<DD>Toffler also spoke about the importance of no longer discussing "the future of the economy" because it implies a continuation of the industrial age, but instead to focus on "the economy of the future," which will compel a redefinition of basic economic fundamentals.
<DD>In conclusion, Toffler said that the Information Age is shattering existing cultures around the world, and while we can "remain American, we cannot remain Americans of the past but will be Americans of the future."

<H4>It's Time to Pull the Plug on Federal Power</H4>
<P>
<BR>
<DD>Declaring that federally owned power facilities created during the New Deal have accomplished their mission, PFF released a white paper urging their privatization.  The <IMG SRC="/pff/asp-pics/1.gif" ALT="Rep. John Shadegg"  ALIGN=right>paper, co-authored by Representative John Shadegg (R-AZ) and Foundation Senior Fellow Michael Block, proposes a privatization method modeled on Czech experience, where consumers receive a portion of the money from privatization.
<DD>Power Marketing Administrations (PMA's) were designed to provide a supply of inexpensive power to impoverished rural areas; today, many of the once underdeveloped areas are affluent.   "PMAs' assets are of significant value to the private electric energy industry and, if sold by the government, would increase operating efficiency, eliminate market distortions, advance competition in electricity markets, and generate significant revenue for federal deficit reduction," argues the paper.
<DD>The paper  Lights Out on Federal Power:  Privatization for the   21st Century  outlines how the federal government should sell three PMA's, generating nearly $4.5 billion to reduce the budget deficit.

<H4>PFF Releases Telecom Book, The Innovation Age</H4>
<P>
<BR>
<DD>Peter K. Pitsch, PFF Adjunct Fellow and former Chief of Staff and Research Director at the FCC, authored the newly released Innovation Age:  A New Perspective on the Telecom Revolution.
<DD>Advancements in computer and digital information technologies have created an era of rapid economic, technological and social change that Pitsch calls the "Innovation Age."  Economic growth in this realm, argues Pitsch, depends on constant innovation and competition; therefore, government efforts to regulate these new technologies should adapt to reflect this new paradigm.
<DD>"Today's complexity and change make Hayek's 'spontaneous order' and Schumpeter's 'creative destruction' more compelling than ever before.  Peter Pitsch combines these concepts in a new economics of innovation that provides an illuminating view of telecom  both how to understand it and why market forces will regulate it best," says author George Gilder about The Innovation Age.

<H4>For Cleaner Air,  PFF Says Think Globally, Act Locally</H4>
<P>
<BR>
<DD>A new PFF white paper urges the creation of local Environmental Innovation Areas (EIAs) that recognize the variation in environmental conditions across America and thus will serve to solve regional pollution problems.  The paper calls for using EIAs as a means of promoting alternative fuel vehicles to meet clean air requirements and petroleum import reduction goals.
<DD>"Different regions face different pollution problems, and thus they must be given the flexibility to meet clean air requirements in ways best suited for their region," said Bruce Yandle, a co-author of the white paper, titled Clean Air and Emerging Alternative Fuel Vehicles:  A Time for Environmental Innovation Areas. 
<DD>"Alternative fuel  or non petroleum-based  vehicles pollute less and should serve as an important component of many regions' strategies for meeting clean air goals," says the paper.

<td valign="top" width="20%">PFF is working to describe what a Transformation of American Life
driven by the new technologies of the information revolution really
means.  How will it change our fundamental values and beliefs?
 Society's elemental relationships?   The organization and workings
of our economy?  And our political compact with ourselves [or
is it, after all, between us and the state]?
<P>
If we can describe what is to come, we can show what is to be
done.  In addition, policy change is taking place in Washington,
in state legislatures, indeed, in governments around the world,
as policymakers attempt to understand the consequences of the
move from an analog to a digital world and its impact on regulatory
policy.  PFF is actively involved in the telecommunications debate,
focusing on the next generation of deregulation.

<td valign="top" width="20%">The talk in Washington is all about the end of the old party system.
 Not FDR's grand coalition (already dead!), but the two parties
themselves, the party system itself, seems to be unraveling. 
Are rebel voters, renegade factions, and brash new parties just
perturbations on an historical continuum? Or is the Old Order
really tottering?  And if it goes, what rises to take its place?
<P>
From where does all this voter anger arise?  Why do they feel
so alienated from their government?  The current structure of
the Federal government - centralized, bureaucratic decision making
in Washington to solve the nation's problems - came to the fore
in the 1930s and has reigned supreme ever since.  Until today.
 What type of governmental structures are needed for the 21st
century?  Is it time to replace the industrial state?

Surgical Lasers!  Genetic Engineering!  Molecular Transports!
 Surgery in Cyberspace!  Civilization is poised to make major
strides in medicine and health.  These advances have the potential
to dramatically increase both life spans and the quality of life,
while at the same time reducing the cost of health care.
<P>
Yet America's enjoyment of these benefits is threatened because
every day the current system for approving new medical technology
stays in place is another day Americans die needless deaths and
suffer senseless pain.   Why is that many of our drug and medical
device companies are able to offer products to patients in Europe
years before they ever receive FDA approval to do in the USA?
 How do we speed the approval process while ensuring safety? 
Who should pay for all this?  Is it time to replace the FDA?

<P><h2>Mission Statement</h2></center>
<p>
Progress is the belief that Mankind has advanced in the past, is presently
advancing, and will continue to advance through the foreseeable future.<p>

No idea is more American, no idea has played a more central role in the
development of Western, and more recently, American Civilization. No idea is more
important to our collective future, and no idea has suffered more from the
cultural nihilism of the past 30 years than the idea of progress.<p>

America's Founding Fathers were unwavering disciples of the idea of progress<p>

But theirs' was a special brand of progress. They understood history, to borrow
Hegel's words, as "none other than the progress of the consciousness of freedom,"
and they placed their own concept of freedom at the heart of the American
Declaration -- in the "self-evident" proposition that "all men are created equal;
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that
among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."<p>

From John Adams, who wrote that the American Revolution occurred first "in the
hearts and minds of the people," to G.K. Chesterton ("America is the only nation
in the world founded on a creed") to Margaret Thatcher ("No other nation has been
built upon and idea"), it has always been clear that America's identity
transcends geography and ethnicity. Historians have devoted thousands of pages to
explaining our nation's history as the history of her ideas, and if we can be
certain of one thing, it is that America's future will be determined by the
future of her ideas.<p>

The challenge we face is to describe for ourselves and our progeny the historical
underpinnings, economic principles, cultural mores and practical implications of
the next incarnation of the American Idea. We will be judged by our sons and
daughters on our success at renewing, reapplying and passing on the core values
of the American Creed.<p>

That explains the mission of The Progress & Freedom Foundation: To restore, to
renew and to recreate America's sense of its future, a future woven inextricably
with the ideas of progress and freedom. It has been said that "The best way to
predict the future is to create it." Creating ideas that will define America's
future is what the Foundation has set about to do since its inception in April
1993.<p>

The Foundation is a private, non-profit, non-partisan idea center organized under
<a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/treasury/bureaus/irs/irs.html">Section 501(c)(3)</a> of the Internal Revenue Code.

<h2>The FCC and the Telecommunications Act of 1996: Putting Competition on Hold?</h2>
</center><br>
<h3>by G.A. (Jay) Keyworth, II and Jeffrey A. Eisenach
<a href="compfoot.html">*</a></h3> 
<P><br>
After years of hard work, Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996, a law designed to "provide a pro-competitive, de-regulatory national policy framework  by opening all telecommunications markets to competition."<sup><A HREF="http://www.townhall.com/pff/compfoot.html#1">1</A></sup>  The bill has been heralded by leaders of both major political parties as a significant step toward moving America's telecommunications system into the digital age.However, as many of us pointed out at the time, the Act did not guarantee a deregulatory outcome.  Instead, it gave the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and state regulatory commissions permission to pursue deregulation.  Unfortunately, the early signs suggest the FCC has gone in the opposite direction, attempting to use the Act to expand its regulatory authority.  
<p>
The best evidence that the Commission has gone astray is its massive "interconnect" order, issued this August.  Intended to implement the provisions of the Act requiring competition in local telephone service, the order established a complex and pervasive system of Federal price regulation, effectively pre-empting the process of private negotiations and state oversight Congress intended as the means to achieve competitive markets.
<p>
This month, acting at the behest of state regulators, local telephone companies and others, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit issued a stay of the FCC's rules, pending a hearing scheduled for early next year.  Thus, by overreaching and failing to abide by the Act's intent, the FCC has allowed the entire process of telecommunications deregulation to be placed, at least in part, "on hold."  The new rules -- and the litigation they have inspired -- will in all likelihood delay the advent of competition for local telecommunications services.  And, as the FCC moves to implement other provisions of the Act -- including its universal service provisions -- the new rules send a worrisome signal that the Commission still views itself as the regulatory czar of the telecommunications marketplace.
<p>
<CENTER><B>The 1996 Act and Congressional Intent</B></CENTER>
<p>
The intent of Congress in the Telecommunications Act was clear: to open up local telephone networks to competition, principally through the interconnection of telephone networks so that all carriers can compete and complete the calls of their customers. However, the Act, like many such massive bills, speaks only in broad terms, leaving tremendous discretion to the FCC and to state Public Utility Commissions charged with implementing its provisions. 
<P>
According to the Act, the interconnection process is to be driven principally through negotiations among the carriers competing in the market.  Congress considered private negotiations, not regulatory fiat, to be the best means of moving rapidly toward a competitive telecommunications industry.  Congress gave the FCC authority to implement the interconnection policy contained in the Act through the adoption of overall guidelines, but did not intend for the FCC to write detailed requirements governing every aspect of interconnection agreements.  That was supposed to be left to the market and to the states, which are authorized to act as arbitrators in cases where interconnection negotiations break down.
<p>
<CENTER><B>Implementation:  Undermining the Law</B></CENTER>
<p>
In some areas of implementation, such as the entry of the Baby Bell telephone companies into video, the FCC seems to accept the broad deregulatory intent of the Act.  But in the interconnection proceeding, the FCC adopted a very heavy-handed, regulatory approach. In its August 1996 "interconnect" order, consisting of more than 1,400 single-spaced pages and 3,200 footnotes, the FCC issued minutely detailed regulations governing local-loop competition.<sup><A HREF="http://www.townhall.com/pff/compfoot.html#2">2</A></sup>  The rulemaking addresses nearly 10,000 issues and sub-issues, and adopts meticulous directives for many of them.  Among the egregious examples of over-regulation is a requirement on how to allocate square footage in a telephone company central office, including how floor plans must be devised.  There is even a requirement that phone companies check with their competitors before remodeling.
<p>
The FCC's approach to implementing the Act demonstrates its lack of faith in the ability of the market and states to promote competition in telecommunications.  For instance, the FCC regulations determine in detail the manner in which interconnection should occur, leaving little room for private negotiations among competitors.  The FCC expressly rejected the prospect that individual states might implement the Act in ways tailored to local market conditions, suggesting that such an approach would create too great an administrative burden for Federal regulators.  Instead, the rules provide for a national baseline for companies to follow in negotiating the price and manner of interconnection agreements.  These provisions usurp from the states their historic authority to regulate local telephony and reduce their role to merely checking that the FCC's rules are followed.
<p>
<CENTER><B>Back in Court</B></CENTER>
<p>
After years of difficult negotiation in Congress, where competing sectors of the telecommunications industry were heard and their interests and the public interest were carefully balanced, the 1996 Act emerged as a bill that no one saw as perfect, but most saw as a step forward.  Importantly, the Act offered the prospect of removing oversight of telecommunications markets from the courts (which have acted as de facto regulators under the infamous "Modified Final Judgment" breaking up AT&T) and placing it back in the hands of the marketplace, the states and -- to a limited extent -- Federal regulators.
<p>
The FCC's interconnection order has had the opposite effect.  By attempting to use the Act as the basis for a Federal power grab, the Commission ensured a court challenge.  That challenge came not just from aggrieved parties (i.e., local telephone companies) who found the Commission's pricing rules unfair, but also from states who saw the order as an infringement on their authority.
<p>
In granting a stay of the FCC's order, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals made clear its view that the Commission's order was more likely to harm competition than encourage it.  "Before the FCC published its regulations," the court found, the parties were "working together to implement the local competition provisions of the Act. The Act's system of private negotiation backed by state-run arbitration was operating without input from the FCC."<sup><A HREF="http://www.townhall.com/pff/compfoot.html#3">3</A></sup>  The Commission's order, said the court, would "establish a price ceiling," which "inevitably confines and restricts the give and take of free negotiations and arbitrations."  As a result of the order, the court continued, "the negotiations preferred by Congress are already breaking down due to the competitors' desire to hold out for the FCC's proxy rates" (i.e., the price ceilings set in the FCC's order).
<p>
The court was also clear in suggesting that the Commission overstepped its bounds. "[W]e are skeptical," it stated, "that the FCC's roundabout construction of the statute could override what, at first blush, appears to be a rather clear and direct indication . . . that the state commissions should establish prices."  As a result, the court concluded, "the petitioners have demonstrated that they will likely succeed on the merits of their appeals."
<p>
Still, no one can be sure how the court -- which will not issue a final decision until at least next Spring -- will ultimately rule.  Thus, the process of creating competition in local telephone markets is effectively on hold.  Such legal wrangling, which may drag on for years, will delay the implementation of the law, denying to consumers the benefits of competition in the local telephone market  -- including access to low-cost ISDN and other advanced services needed for growth of the Internet.   
<p>
<CENTER><B>What Next?  Implementing Universal Service</B></CENTER>
<p>
The FCC's interconnection order has implications well beyond the question of local competition.  In particular, it creates a dangerous precedent as the FCC prepares to implement the universal service provisions of the 1996 Act.
<P>
By November 8, the Federal-State Joint Board created by the Telecommunications Act will make a recommendation to the FCC on implementing the universal service provisions.  The Joint Board is almost exclusively composed of regulators, and it thus will not be surprising if they recommend regulation as the best method of implementation.  If the interconnect rule really does signal the FCC's continued love affair with detailed, excessive regulation, the result could well be yet another attempt to expand Federal authority.  The intent of the Telecommunications Act could, in other words, once again be turned on its head.
<P>
The Joint Board and the FCC should keep in mind a number of principles regarding universal service, including:
<P>
While people may have a "right" to dial-tone service to call the police or paramedics, no-one has a "right for that dial tone to be delivered over wires."  In some cases cellular phone service may be less expensive than wire.  If anything is to be mandated, it should be the service offered, not the technology by which it is accomplished.
<P>
Federal mandates, if any, should be minimal and limited to lifeline telephone service.  Provision of other telecommunications services (for example, voicemail or Internet access) should not be mandated from Washington but left to state officials to order and purchase.
<P>
Federally mandated universal service should be paid for by the Federal government; such subsidies should be raised in a competitively neutral manner and be obvious to those from whom they are collected.  States should be responsible for paying for any supplemental state mandates.  The FCC should set guidelines to ensure that any state subsidies are raised in a competitively neutral manner and are explicit to those from whom they are collected.
<P>
The essentially local nature of universal service  as ordered by Congress and demanded in practice  reinforces many of the arguments advanced by Congress and the Courts on interconnection.  The costs of specific universal service programs are impacted, in large part, by the progress of competition in specific local markets and the pricing of interconnection agreements.  The devolution of Federal authority over interconnection agreements therefore implies the devolution of universal service mandates.  On the other hand, Federal usurpation of state authority on interconnection issues makes state leadership on universal service questions nearly impossible.
<P>
Wherever possible, the FCC should rely on the market, not regulation, to most effectively implement universal service policies.  For instance, competitive bidding (similar to FCC-auctioned licenses for personal communications systems) could be used to control the cost of subsidies in high-cost areas.  Auctions to provide service among potential competitors would reveal the minimum subsidy required for them to provide service.  This would remove the arbitrariness and controversy associated with cost estimation by government mandate.
<P>
<CENTER><B>Moving Ahead:  Accountability to Congress</B></CENTER>
<P>
The telecommuncations marketplace is not yet fully competitive.  Congress recognized the need for continuing, limited oversight by the FCC to manage the transition.  But massive, detailed regulation is not the way to achieve competition.  Instead, in implementing the Telecommunications Act, the FCC should concentrate its efforts on a few overarching issues and articulate a limited number of boundary-setting guidelines.  The practical, prudent approach is for the FCC to defer largely to the states, while preserving the FCC's ability to address significant problems on review.
<P>
If the FCC fails to reaffirm both the deregulatory intent and the devolutionary spirit embraced by the Telecommunications Act, the prospects for rapid progress toward a competitive telecommunications marketplace will be dramatically reduced, and Congress' central intent in passing the Act will be frustrated.   The question for Congress will then be clear:  Will it allow a regulatory agency to flaunt Congressional will, or will it act to ensure that the goal of a competitive marketplace is achieved?<p><BR>

<h2>The Unveiling of the Innovation Age </h2>
</center>

On behalf of Hudson Institute and The Progress & Freedom Foundation, I am pleased to invite you to a special briefing on Wednesday, September 11 to unveil Hudson's latest book,<i> The Innovation Age:  A New Perspective on the Telecom Revolution</i>.  The book's author is Hudson and PFF adjunct fellow Peter Pitsch, former Chief of Staff and Chief of Planning at the Federal Communications Commission.<p>


Mr. Pitsch will provide opening remarks, and we have asked <b>Congressman Bob Walker</b> (R-PA) to do the same.  Serving as panel discussants will be <b>William E. Cohen</b>, Deputy Director, Policy Planning, for the Federal Trade Commission and <b> Blair Levin</b>, Chief of Staff for Chairman Reed Hundt of the Federal Communications Commission.  In discussing Mr. Pitsch's new book, they will attempt to answer the following questions:<p>
<ul> 
<li>Is the "Innovation Age" real?
<li>Does it require developing a new political economy of innovation?
<li>Has it strengthened the comparative advantage of marketplace solutions vis--vis regulation?
<li>Are the book's proposed reforms to telecommunications regulation desirable?
</ul>
	Advancements in computer and digital information technologies have created an era of rapid economic and technological change which Mr. Pitsch calls the "Innovation Age."  In the book, he describes how the resulting complexity and potential for explosive growth have increased the cost of regulatory distortions, especially in the telecommunications market.  Peter Passell of <i>The New York Times</i> calls <i>The Innovation Age </I>  "painless introduction to the way economists are now rethinking regulation."<p>

	<i>This special briefing will be held from 1:30 to 3:30 p.m. on Wednesday, September 11, in Room 106 of Dirksen Senate Office Building.</i>  If you would like additional information, please call Mary Brown, Hudson's Director of Special Events, at 317-549-4150.  We hope you will be able to stop by.<p>

<h2>Bradley, White to Attend Aspen Summit '96</h2>
</center>
<br>
Senator Bill Bradley (D-NJ) and Representative Rick White (R-WA) will be among the participants at the Aspen Summit this August 5-6, The Progress & Freedom Foundation announced today. The Summit will explore whether America's future in the digital age will be one of progress or decay.
<p>
White, who is chairman of the Congressional Internet Caucus, and Bradley, who recently completed a tour promoting his new book <i>Time Present, Time Past</i>, will be among the more than 30 participants at the Sumrnit. Also attending will be author Alvin Toffler, PBS commentator David Gergen, ACLU president Nadine Strossen, author George Gilder, John Gage of Sun Microsystems, and author David Gelemter.
<p>
"A recurring theme in this election year is the insecurity Arnericans feel about their future," said Foundation president Jeffrey A. Eisenach. "The Summit will examine how America can best cope with the transition to a new society - how to make the transition less painful and more productive for all Americans.
<p>
The Summit, to be held at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Aspen, Colo., will also feature a debate on whether the growth of the Internet is a "Leading Cultural Indicator of Progress." Participants will include Edwin Diamond and Stephen Bates, authors of "Smash the Internet" (<i>WeeSdy Standard</i>, Oct. 30, 1995), G.A. (Jay) Keyworth, former Science Advisor to President Reagan, and Esther Dyson, president of EDventure Holdings.
<p>
Four working groups at the Summit will explore what government policies should be pursued.to ensure continued progress tosward a better future the the digital age. Former FCC Commissioner Dennis Patrick will highlight a session on reglulatory convergence and Shira Perlmutter, Associate Register for International Affairs and Policy at the Copyright Office, will highlight a session on intellectual property.

</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Advances in technology are perhaps the single
most important ingredient of further progress in providing a cleaner
environment for America and the world.  New clean-up technologies,
more efficient production processes - and simply the transition
from a smokestack-laden industrial economy to a digital economy
- provide the opportunity for today's Americans to live in a dramatically
cleaner world than the one their parents left them.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Unhappily, current environmental policies often
lock obsolete technologies in place, or fail to provide appropriate
incentives for the development and adoption of new technologies
that are both cleaner and less costly than those currently in
use.  Even where our current policies work to encourage the adoption
of new technologies, they do so in ways that are often ineffective,
typically through the use of top-down, command-and-control mandates.
<p> 
Current policies also fail, in many cases, to recognize that
while our commitment to a cleaner environment is national in scope,
the problem is often local or regional in nature - and hence not
easily addressed through national, one-size-fits-all standards.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">America's current policies with respect to
air pollution are a case in point.  Since the 1970s, we achieved
significant progress in reducing emissions, but never enough to
meet clean air standards nationwide.  In response, the 1990 Clean
Air Act Amendments set different rules for the most polluted regions
and called for the development and deployment of new technologies
- including alternative fuel (nonpetroleum-based) vehicles (AFVs).
Yet in implementing a complex patchwork of programs to promote
AFVs, the Executive Branch is utilizing top-down mandates that
attempt to impose a uniform regime on an environmental problem
that varies dramatically by region.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The clean air benefits of AFVs vary widely
by region for two reasons.  First, the types of air pollution
AFVs address are limited mainly to 22 cities, the state of California
and a 12-state region in the Northeast.  Second, the best way
of addressing these pollution problems also varies - in some cases,
AFVs may be the better approach; in other cases, different options
will be more effective.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">At the same time, the national security benefits
of AFVs (i.e., the reduction in American dependence on imported
petroleum) know no regional boundaries and hence call for a national
approach to encourage AFVs.  Achieving national promotion of AFVs
while maintaining regional flexibility in their use to reduce
air pollution is a complex challenge.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Among different alternative fuel technologies
being developed, compressed natural gas and liquefied natural
gas offer the best prospects for AFV expansion.  And while the
infrastructure problem associated with refueling and delivery
of alternative fuels is a challenge, the hurdles for serving important
markets have been reduced significantly in recent years.  In fact,
in some important niche markets, conversion to alternative fuels
is justified on differences in fuel costs alone.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">The current government approach to providing
incentives for AFV use is neither efficient nor effective.  For
example, our examination of current policies shows that:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The peculiar atmospheric traits of different
urban areas are not recognized by federal standards designed to
reduce urban smog.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Efforts by the Department of Energy to
encourage AFV use and federal mandates for the expansion of AFVs
in the federal fleet are not coordinated with EPA's efforts to
improve air quality in metropolitan regions.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Federal fuel tax policies are not well
geared to provide larger incentives for cleaner-burning fuels.
(State fuel tax incentives are more closely tied to emission characteristics.)</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The mandated purchase of AFVs by operators
of public and private fleets for the purpose of providing national
security benefits is not accompanied by financial incentives for
covering incremental costs.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Heavy-duty trucks and other large vehicles,
which offer bright prospects for AFV use, are not covered by federal
statutes designed to encourage AFV use.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">America needs a new, more effective and efficient
approach to promoting AFVs.  Among its main features should be:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">A program of Environmental Innovation Areas
(EIAs) that recognize the peculiar environmental challenges of
U.S. cities and regions.  These newly created EIAs should be given
complete flexibility in choosing the means for meeting baseline
environmental standards and should serve as coordinating units
for federal efforts to expand AFV use.   </FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Federal fuel taxes that no longer favor
or discriminate against alternative fuels used in the search for
cleaner air.  Instead, tax policy should be designed to provide
incentives for the use of cleaner fuels that address emission
problems reaching far beyond the limits of cities and multi-state
regions.  States and regions should be encouraged to design fuel
taxes that encourage the appropriate use of cleaner burning fuels
in their areas.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">Furthermore,</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Federal funds to cover the full incremental
cost of AFVs should accompany federal mandates that require nonfederal
fleet AFV purchases.  Based on past legislative goals considered
by Congress, funding for light AFVs could amount to as much as
$326 million annually.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">There are a variety of existing tax subsidy
and expenditure programs that could be redeployed to at least
partly offset this cost.</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Because AFVs both pollute less and reduce
American reliance on imported petroleum, incentives for AFV use
are a lower-cost way to improve automobile fuel efficiency than
Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial"> By removing barriers to expanded AFV use and
deployment of other improved technologies, implementation of these
proposals would reduce the cost of achieving environmental and
national energy security goals.  This plan would expand AFV use
and concentrate environmental benefits in the most appropriate
geographical areas.  Among other benefits of such a program would
be:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Multiple Environmental Innovation Areas
(EIAs) that will provide a national laboratory for discovering
lower cost institutions for improving all dimensions of environmental
quality.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">The more logical expansion of AFV infrastructure
due to the creative and expanded use of EIAs and federally provided
funds to assist with the expansion of the AFV fleet.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Minimized costs in producing cleaner air
through the encouragement of tradeoffs between AFVs and other
approaches for reducing air pollution.</FONT>
<LI><FONT FACE="Arial">Improved technological innovation through
the adoption of new technology.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">There is no magic bullet or one best approach
for reducing air pollution in the United States.  A successful
policy for the 21st century will rely on a multitude of solutions
that emerge from those closest to the problem.  AFVs are a proven
technology that offer meaningful environmental benefits.  With
appropriate incentives and flexible institutions for accomplishing
environmental goals, AFVs can become an even more important part
of the environmental arsenal.</FONT>

<h2>New Strategy Required for Cleaner Air</h2>
The Progress & Freedom Foundation today released a white paper urging for the creation of local Environmental Innovation Areas (EIAs) that recognize the variation in environmental conditions across America and thus will serve to solve regional pollution problems.  The paper calls for using EIAs as a means of promoting alternative fuel vehicles to meet clean air requirements and petroleum import reduction goals.

"Different regions face different pollution problems, and thus they must be given the flexibility to meet clean air requirements in ways best suited for their region," said Bruce Yandle, a co-author of the white paper, titled <i><a href="/pff/clean/exec.html">Clean Air and Emerging Alternative Fuel Vehicles:  A Time for Environmental Innovation Areas</a></i>.  "Alternative fuel -- or non petroleum-based -- vehicles pollute less and should serve as an important component of many regions strategies for meeting clean air goals."<p>

The white paper calls for an end to Federal fuel taxes that discriminate against alternative fuels.  In their place it urges incentives for states and regions to design fuel taxes that encourage the appropriate use of cleaner burning fuels in their area.  The authors also argue that alternative fuel vehicles are a lower-cost way to improve automobile efficiency than Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards.<p>

"By removing barriers to expanded alternative fuel vehicle use and development of other improved technologies, these proposals would reduce the cost of achieving environmental and national energy security goals," argues the paper.<p>

Copies of the white paper are available from the Foundation by calling 202/289-8928 or on its Internet homepage:  www.pff.org.

<h2>Bradley, White to Attend Aspen Summit 96</h2>

Senator Bill Bradley (D-NJ) and Representative Rick White (R-WA) will be among the participants at the Aspen Summit this August 5-6, The Progress & Freedom Foundation announced today.  The Summit will explore whether America's future in the digital age will be one of progress or decay.
<p>
White, who is chairman of the Congressional Internet Caucus, and Bradley, who recently completed a tour promoting his new book <b>Time Present, Time Past</b>, will be among the more than 30 participants at the Summit.  Also attending will be author Alvin Toffler, PBS commentator David Gergen, ACLU president Nadine Strossen, author George Gilder, John Gage of Sun Microsystems, and author David Gelernter.
<p>
"A recurring theme in this election year is the insecurity Americans feel about their future," said Foundation president Jeffrey A. Eisenach.  "The Summit will examine how America can best cope with the transition to a new society  how to make the transition less painful and more productive for all Americans."
<p>
The Summit, to be held at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Aspen, Colo., will also feature a debate on whether the growth of the Internet is a "Leading Cultural Indicator of Progress." Participants will include Edwin Diamond and Stephen Bates, authors of "Smash the Internet" (<i>Weekly Standard</i>, Oct. 30, 1995), G.A. (Jay) Keyworth, former Science Advisor to President Reagan, and Esther Dyson, president of EDventure Holdings.
<p>
Four working groups at the Summit will explore what government policies should be pursued to ensure continued progress toward a better future in the digital age.  Former FCC Commissioner Dennis Patrick will highlight a session on regulatory convergence and Shira Perlmutter, Associate Register for International Affairs and Policy at the Copyright Office, will highlight a session on intellectual property.
<p>
A private, non-profit, non-partisan idea center established in 1993, The Progress & Freedom Foundation aims to create a positive vision of the future founded in the historic principles of the American Idea.

<h2>Administration Undermines Information Age National Security</h2>

The Clinton Administration's efforts to control the spread of "encryption" tools that scramble digital communications is putting at risk America's lead in the global communications race and threatening the U.S.'s future ability to protect itself, asserts a report issued today by The Progress & Freedom Foundation.<p>

	Encryption tools are key to the development of on-line banking, protecting privacy in an age when more and more information is stored on computers, and ensuring the authenticity of electronic messages. Fearing that terrorists and drug smugglers will encrypt their communications and thus foil American intelligence's electronic "eavesdropping" capabilities, the Administration is supporting continued controls on the export of encryption software.<p>

	Yet the PFF report, co-authored by G.A. Keyworth, chairman of the Foundation and former Science Advisor to President Reagan, found that "no matter how stringent U.S. export controls, they can do nothing to stop a bright mathematician in Tokyo or Bombay from creating new means of encryption to fill the void left by American abdication of the market."<p>

	The report warned that government attempts to control encryption tools will destroy America's commercial and technological lead in the field.  This will eventually deny America - including the intelligence community itself - the latest encryption tools, because they will no longer be developed in the United States.<p>

In addition, the report continued, the Administration's policies jeopardize America's continued lead in the communications race and thus diminish the rewards of economic growth and new goods, services and social opportunities Americans would otherwise have enjoyed.<p>

<h2>THE COMPUTER REVOLUTION, ENCRYPTION AND
TRUE THREATS TO NATIONAL SECURITY</h2>
</center><br>
<h3>by G. A. Keyworth, II, and David E. Colton, Esq.
<a href="encry-foot.html">*</a></h3> 
<P><br>
 Americans take it for granted that when they a send package via first class
mail its contents are protected.  We do not worry that someone will open our
envelopes and take our checking or credit card account numbers, read our
personal letters, or steal our business ideas.
<P>
Yet our privacy could be threatened as we move to a digital economy, where
more and more information is shared electronically  over the Internet, via
fax machines or on wireless phones.  Right now, the Clinton Administration is
proposing to restrict Americans ability to use "encryption" tools that
scramble digital communications so that they cannot be read by anyone other
than the intended receiver.  Today, basic encryption technology is utilized
every time you punch in your ATM code or use a password to protect files on
your computer.   But better encryption tools are needed to protect the assets
of on-line banking customers, the rights of musicians selling their songs in
Cyberspace or the trade secrets of American companies e-mailing documents to
their overseas branches.
<P>
America currently leads the world in the development of computer software 
including encryption.  Indeed, our current position as the undisputed leader
of the digital age derives from our overwhelming success at winning the
computer race. Start-ups that were born in our garages and hobby clubs less
than twenty years ago have created a whole new economy, the $1.5 trillion
digital industry.  As a result, the nexus of technological innovation and
wealth creation for this new economy is in Silicon Valley, not Tokyo, Paris
or Bonn.  
<P>
<table>
<tr width=80>
<td><hr width=75><h3>The Clinton Administrations attempt to control encryption technology is one
of the most important examples of how outdated regulatory thinking threatens
Americas ability to compete and win in the digital era.
</h3><hr width=75></td>
<td hspace=5>
Yet a new contest is already underway: the race to generate wealth by
connecting computers into a global, digital communications system.  The rules
for this competition are just now being set, and the situation is very
different from the computer race.  The government largely refrained from
regulating the computer industry (no one told Apple or Microsoft or Intel
what markets they could enter or what products they could sell).  In the
communications race, America's regulatory apparatus (i.e., the FCC)  created
in the 1930s, before television networks, cellular phones or e-mail  is a
huge handicap.   Americas competitive lead in the communications race could
be squandered by the retarding forces of excessive regulation, with immense
consequences:  lost technological leadership, fewer jobs and lower standards
of living.
</td></tr></table>

<P>
While the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was an important first step toward
removing roadblocks in the creation of a digital communications network, much
work remains if America is to maintain its international lead.  Our most
formidable opponent is not foreign competition, but a misguided, overzealous
Federal government.  The Administrations attempt to control encryption
technology is one of the most important examples of how outdated regulatory
thinking threatens Americas ability to compete and win in the digital era.
<P><br>
<b>Encryption:  Protecting Your Valuables from Theft</b>
<br>
The encryption concepts at issue are not complicated.  In essence, encryption
technology empowers people to protect their digital property from
unauthorized use.  Whether you are sending an e-mail to a friend, your doctor
is faxing your medical records to the insurance company, you are ordering a
take-out dinner over you wireless phone (and using your credit card number to
pay in advance), or giving the plans for your latest product to your business
partner on a floppy disc, encryption tools allow you to "scramble" your
message.  Only the intended recipient  who holds a "key"  can access the
information.
<P>
Encryption technology is based on strings of numbers (the "key").  The more
numbers in the key, the "stronger" the encryption.  For instance, the
standard ATM code of four numbers would be harder to crack if it were ten
numbers.  The possible variations increase dramatically each time a number is
added to a key, and thus more computing power is required to figure out all
the possible combinations.
<P>
There are two types of encryption.  The first is known as single key, in
which the key to code and decode a transmission is the same. 	The second
encryption system, known as the public key approach, uses two sets of keys.
 One key is publicly revealed, the other is known only to the user.  The keys
are linked in such a manner that information encrypted by the public key can
only be deciphered by the corresponding private key.  Public key techniques
are much more secure than single key approaches.  Such programs are
available, world-wide and generally free, through the Internet.  It is these
public key programs that are the real focus of the Administrations attempt
to restrict encryption tools.
<P>
The Administration seeks to retard development of encryption technologies by
allowing export only of mass market software with "weak" encryption standards
using 40-bit keys.<a href="encry-foot.html"><sup>1</sup></a>   
Similar restrictions apply to hardware and computer
systems.<a href="encry-foot.html"><sup>2</sup></a>
   The stated goal is to slow development of encryption technologies
abroad, so that the intelligence community (CIA, FBI, NSA, etc.) will have
easier access to communications.
<P><br>
<b>Are Encryption Controls Part
of the American Spirit?</b>
<br>
<table>
<tr width=80>

<td>
The Administration invokes "national security" concerns to justify export
control regulations that cripple development of sophisticated U.S. encryption
technologies.  The government claims that it must have the ability to monitor
communications in the digital age in order to protect Americans from
terrorists, drug smugglers and other nefarious types. To achieve this, the
Administration argues, we must control the terms and conditions by which
individual Americans can use sophisticated encryption technology both <i>at home
</i>and abroad.<a href="encry-foot.html"><sup>3</sup></a>   
Even at the height of the Cold War, the intelligence community
never seriously proposed such a massive and pervasive intrusion into the
lives of American citizens.
</td>
<td><hr width=75><h3>Even at the height of the Cold War, the intelligence community never

American citizens.</h3><hr width=75>
</td>
</tr></table> 
<P>
How we handle this issue has profound implications for American society in
the digital age.   The encryption debate raises serious Constitutional
questions.  What is the role of the Fourth Amendment, which reserves to the
people the right "to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects"?
 What constitutes an unreasonable search and seizure in Cyberspace?  What
rights to privacy can citizens expect in a digital era?  These are major,
fundamental questions that the American people must resolve.  No one yet has
the answers.  Yet the Administrations encryption proposals, if enacted,
would allow what are little more than bureaucratic interests in the national
security community to dictate the answers.
<P>
The outcome of the encryption debate will also shape the foundation for U.S.
economic prosperity in the digital age.  A society of connected computing and
networking requires that all individuals have confidence that their
communications are secure and that messages and data are authentic, not
forgeries.  Encryption is the means to make that possible.
<P>
<table>
<tr width=80>
<td><hr width=75>
<h3>The Administrations attempts to control encryption technology on national
security grounds would actually undermine Americas security in the digital
age.</h3>
<hr width=75></td>
<td>
But encryption technology is not just about privacy and secure
communications.  It is also about protecting intellectual property.  For
instance, with innovative encryption systems, the makers of <i>Jurassic Park II
</i>(for example) would be able to encrypt a digital signal in the movie that
prevents bootlegged copies of it being made and sold on the black market.
 Before artists, entrepreneurs or Fortune 500 companies will invest their
resources in a new digital product, they will demand assurances that it be
secure from theft.
</td></tr>
</table>
<P>
The best means of protection is self-defense.  American companies should be
allowed to develop and use encryption tools to protect their intellectual
property and trade secrets before turning to government for assistance.  In
that sense, encryption can be thought of as the "barbed wire" of the digital
age, allowing owners of intellectual property to be their own first lines of
defense against theft and encroachment, just as barbed wire allowed farmers
on America's prairie to protect themselves against encroachment by wayward
cattle.  Barbed wire was not an <i>alternative</i> to government enforcement of
property rights, but it allowed government to serve as a <i>backstop</i> rather than
as the first line of defense.<a href="encry-foot.html"><sup>4</sup></a>  
<p><br>
<b>Encryption Obsolescence
at Hyper Speed</b>
<P>
To maintain their competitive lead in the digitally connected economy,
American companies are continually creating encryption technologies.  Such
rapid innovation makes the national security and  intelligence communities
goals of controlling this technology illusory.  Governments can no longer
dictate the pace and scope of technological innovation.
<P>
The core concept of the computer revolution, Moores Law, states that the
power of a microprocessor doubles approximately every 18 months while its
costs stay the same.  Thus, in 1984, a desktop computer could execute 2
million instructions per second, but by 1994, the same machine was capable of
256 million instructions per second.  By 1998, a desktop microprocessor will
run more than 2 <i>billion </i> instructions per second.  Such incredible
advancement in computer power guarantees that the intelligence community will
fail to control encryption technology.
<P>
Moores Law makes the focus on encryption key length irrelevant.  So-called
strong encryption is only "strong" relative to available computing power to
crack the string of numbers that comprise the key.  As computing power
doubles every 18 months, no encryption scheme will remain strong for long;
adding numbers to the key merely forestalls the inevitable. Encryption will
be rendered quickly weak without constant innovation .
<P>
Yet the Administration proposes to enshrine in law a mandated encryption
standard based on todays computing power  a standard that would soon be
rendered obsolete by advances in microprocessor speed.  This is not a
theoretical prediction; it is hard fact.  Indeed, the governments preferred
40-bit key has already been compromised  in this case by two French graduate
students using their schools computer to hack Netscape.  Cheap and
affordable chips customized to break encryption keys are readily available.
 For example, one "field programmable gate arrays" chip, costing as little as
$20, can crack the 40-bit key in about five hours.  But many such chips can
be used together, in parallel, to break a 40-bit key in about 24 <i>seconds</i>.
 Clearly, government encryption "standards" would soon be overtaken by
technology, leaving Americans handcuffed in their ability to compete with
foreigners.
<P><br>

<b>The True Threat to National Security: Encryption Controls,
Not Encryption Technology</b>
<p>
The Administrations attempts to control encryption technology on national
security grounds would actually undermine Americas security in the digital
age.  Export controls already are threatening to drive Americas software
industry off-shore.  Allowed to continue, this phenonemon eventually will
deny America -- <i>including the intelligence community itself</i> -- the latest in
encryption technology.
<P>
Among the many problems with export controls on encryption technology, first
and foremost is the fact that they are unworkable.  In the past, it was
possible to contain specific technologies (e.g. metallurgical science applied
to design of submarines or "stealth" airplanes) through export controls.
 These technologies focus on specific capabilities and require significant
infrastructure to be of use.  But digital technology can be taken out of the
country almost effortlessly by transmitting it over the Internet.  And, of
course, nothing can prevent foreigners from coming to America, legally
purchasing encryption technology (at stores such as Wal-Mart) and then
(illegally) taking it home with them. Hackers try to demonstrate the
absurdity of export controls by noting that it may be considered illegal to
wear a t-shirt, when leaving the United States, that has printed on it the
code for an encryption key (the t-shirt would be considered a munition).
<P>
It is also absurd to assume that, just because American encryption technology
is not legally for sale on the international market, that foreign
governments, companies and criminals will not be able to encrypt their
communications and intellectual property.   Unlike, say, nuclear weapons,
which require amounts of difficult-to-obtain materials to build, computer
software design has virtually no "barriers to entry."  Joseph Schumpeters
description of the capitalist firm truly applies here:  "Most new firms are
founded with an idea and definite purpose.  The life goes out of them when
that idea or purpose has been fulfilled or has become obsolete or even if,
without having become obsolete, it has ceased to be new."   This is
particularly apt for encryption technologies.<a href="encry-foot.html"><sup>5</sup></a> 
<P>
<table>
<tr width =80>
<td><hr width=75>
<h3>Preventing Americas leading companies from selling their products around the
world denies America's software firms the chance to maintain their lead in
the global connected computing race.
</h3><hr width=75></td>
<td>
No matter how stringent U.S. export controls, they can do nothing to stop a
bright mathematician in Tokyo or Bombay from creating new means of encryption
to fill the void left by American abdication of the market.  A recent survey
of products employing cryptography both within and outside the United States
confirms the lack of barriers to entry in encryption technology.
<a href="encry-foot.html"><sup>6</sup></a>    Companies
from more than 28 countries sell almost 500 encryption products.  If American
leadership stumbles, others are ready and eager to assume the mantle.
</td></tr></table>
  Today, the intelligence community is worried about controlling the latest
encryption technology developed in the United States.  With export controls
in place, Americans may find in just a few short years that the true national
security problem is trying to obtain the latest encryption software developed
<i>outside</i> the United States.
<P>
U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies  perhaps to present Congress
a <i>fait accompli</i>  have urged foreign governments to adopt approaches to
regulating encryption similar to those in America.   But even the adoption by
other governments of proscriptive encryption regulations would not alter our
analysis.  One individual, such as the legendary Phil Zimmerman, can create
an encryption system as widely acclaimed as his PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) in
just five months in his cabin in Colorado.  That program is now available
world-wide through the Internet.  Digital technology and the lack of barriers
to entry mean that individuals  from almost anywhere can circumvent
government-imposed limitations  regardless how many governments impose them.
<P>
Export controls also hurt Americas high-tech industry.   Many law abiding
international customers want to protect their communications and intellectual
property for the same reasons as Americans, and, as noted above, they will
develop the technology to do so themselves if they cannot purchase it from
the United States.  The global demand for secure computing continues to grow
with the spread of connected computing.  After all, the international market
for Internet connectivity is 20 times what it is in the United States.  
<a href="encry-foot.html"><sup>7</sup></a>  In
this burgeoning market, the highest demand over the next decade will be for
goods and services that incorporate the assurance of confidentiality only
encryption can provide.
<P>
Preventing Americas leading companies from selling their products around the
world denies America's software firms the chance to maintain their lead in
the global connected computing race. Already, 60 percent of American workers
are knowledge workers, and eight of ten new jobs are in information intensive
sectors of the economy.  More Americans make computers than cars.  More
Americans make semiconductors than build construction equipment, and people
processing data outnumber those refining petroleum.  Should American firms be
foreclosed from competing to win in this market, the immediate effect may be
a 30 percent loss in market share for computer systems alone.
<a href="encry-foot.html"><sup>8</sup></a>     The impact
on the whole U.S. software industry would be equally devastating and
threatens the commanding 75 percent market share for mass market software
enjoyed by American companies today. <a href="encry-foot.html"><sup>9</sup></a> 
   This is merely a short-term extrapolation.  The long-term effects could be even 
more pernicious: lost technological leadership is rarely recovered.
<P>
Yet probably the greatest threat to Americans national security from the
encryption controls being proposed by the intelligence and law enforcement
agencies would be the loss of freedom on the part of U.S. citizens.  Seeking
to retain some control over public key encryption, the most recent
Administration proposal seeks to have Americans register their personal keys
with a government-approved third party.  This is analogous to the government
asking all Americans to place a copy of their safe deposit box keys with a
government-approved third party.  By coercing so-called "voluntary"
cooperation, the intelligence community asks that every American leave
themselves exposed before the State in the digital age.
<p>
Nothing could be more perverse than to turn the potential of the digital era
to empower individuals into a more invasive means of government surveillance
and control.  We believe that the Administrations positions will not
withstand Constitutional challenge.  The question to ask is why, in light of
all we've learned as America's competitiveness has resurged in this new
digital economy, should we waste our time and energy pursuing something that,
in a Jeffersonian sense, is so patently un-American and which, in the
practical sense of Moore's Law, is simply wrong.  As Americans hesitate, the
window of opportunity for continuing our leadership of the computer
revolution is rapidly closing.  
<P><br>
<b>The Threat To American Intelligence and Law Enforcement Is Overstated</b>
<p>
Together with law enforcement agencies, Americas intelligence community
plays a vital role in safeguarding the nation.  Moreover, in many instances
the resources they can bring to bear to battle crime are without peer.   The
technical capabilities of the U.S. intelligence community, for example, are
the finest in the world.  The community has and will continue to have the
technical and human resources to meet its mission.
<P>
The National Security Agency (NSA) and its sister agencies have the capacity
to break current encryption systems, and there is little reason to believe
they will not have the capability to penetrate future designs.   Public
estimates of  the time the NSA requires to break 40- and 56-bit key codes are
conservative, for the agency has truly massive parallel processing power for
"brute force" attacks on a given code.  More importantly, NSA specialists are
world-class, and can often succeed in cracking an encryption system through
"number crunching."  They often understand the inner workings of a given
program or code and can exploit these vulnerabilities, greatly reducing the
burdens of decryption.  While in the short term encryption controls might
make the NSAs task easier, in the long run, as we have noted above, we as a
nation would suffer greatly.
<P>
For the foreseeable future, the intelligence community can provide
time-urgent penetration of communications networks for collection and
counter-intelligence needs.  Cracking an encrypted digital e-mail may not be
as easy as wire tapping an analog telephone.  Nonetheless, the United States
currently has the technical capability needed for security in the digital
future.  To most effectively utilize these capabilities might require tasking
and prioritizing resources in a new way, something all bureaucracies,
including the intelligence and law enforcement agencies, naturally dislike
because it upsets the status quo.  But, ultimately, the intelligence
community relies on the technical innovation and leadership of the Americas
private sector to keep it at the forefront of developments.   Any decline in
U.S. leadership in the computer race, which controls on encryption technology
will lead to, will have repercussions on the NSAs abilities as well. 
<P>
Domestic law enforcement can also pursue its public safety mission without
draconian invasions into the privacy of citizens through mandatory key escrow
systems.  Clear thinking without emotion is required.  Allegations that
encryption technology will result in future New York City World Trade
Tower-type terrorist incidents or bombings of Federal buildings are
irresponsible.  Encryption technologies, of course, had no connection at all
to either incident. (Indeed, it is worth recalling that the FBIs own
informant tried to warn the Bureau  unsuccessfully  about the impending
attack in New York).  Furthermore, it is just as easy to plot a terrorist
attack through almost completely secure first class mail as it is via e-mail.
<P>
<table>
<tr width=150 hspace=5>
<td>
While there have been and certainly will be instances of law enforcement
agencies successfully averting a crime or catching criminals due to the
monitoring of communications, the FBI and other police agencies must adjust
the existing framework for traditional wireline intercepts to the digital
age.   To do so, they must admit one simple truth: organized crime and drug
cartels  or anyone seriously intending to violate the law  will attempt to
buy the best encryption technology available.  Preventing American industry
from developing it simply means the illegal enterprises will buy the
capability from Japan, Bombay or Taiwan.  They may even pay American software
writers to covertly develop code for them.   Regardless of the method,
criminals will obtain encryption technology.
</td>
<td><hr width=75><h3>
By coercing so-called "voluntary" cooperation, the intelligence community
asks that every American leave themselves exposed before the State in the
digital age.</h3><hr width=75>
</td></tr></table>
<P>
The solution is thus not to "dumb down" the American economy and industry.
 Rather, law enforcement must become more digitally savvy.  Upon obtaining
court authorization for digital surveillance, law enforcement must have
access to sufficient resources in the intelligence community should
encryption issues arise.  If it is a question of sharing resources and
capabilities among national security agencies (who currently have among the
best encryption writing and cracking capabilities) and law enforcement
agencies, Congress can help this to occur by developing new coordination
mechanisms.  Long standing bureaucratic rivalries between law enforcement and
intelligence agencies can (and should) be overcome.  If suitable cooperation
is not forthcoming, law enforcement could be permitted to develop its own
cryptographic capabilities.  That would be a small price to pay to enable
America to compete and win in the digital era.
<P><br>
<b>Controlling our Future in
the Digital Age</b>
<p>
We are in the midst of a profound revolution made possible by the
microprocessor.  It is transforming our society more completely and faster
than did the printing press, the telephone or even the television.   By
winning the first round of the computer race, we reaped the rewards of
 economic growth and new goods, services and social opportunities.  We can
win the race for connected computing as well.  This is the best means of
providing for national security, broadly defined. 
<P>
What is called for in encryption is no less than an end to government
sponsored encryption standards, except for its own use.  Export controls on
commercial digital technology, especially in the consumer realm, should be
terminated.  Moreover, the Federal government should be explicitly barred
from placing restrictions on the sale and use of encryption programs
domestically, and mandatory key escrows should be prohibited.  These steps
are necessary for two, reinforcing reasons:  The first is that such barriers
to our future wealth generating capacity are simply unaffordable;  the second
is that such interventions will not work anyway.  
<P>
In a more general sense, however, it is we citizens, not the intelligence
community, who should determine the nature of our Constitutional heritage in
the digital age.

<title>A Message From Aspen -- 1/18/95 -- PFF</title>
</head>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>

<h2>Message from Aspen</h2>
<P>
by <a href="/pff/people/sfellow.html#Vlahos">Michael Vlahos</a></center>
<P>
Big Change is upon us.  In America, we have called this <I>revolution</I>.
 Today, it is also called <I>cyberspace</I>.
<P>
Two dozen doyens of big change and the new world met in Aspen
in August.  The theme on the table:  <I>Cyberspace and the American
Dream</I>.  Big Stuff:  an economic revolution, a transformation
of our way of life.  We asked them:  What does this mean for us,
the way we live together, do business, and govern?  Around the
table were some of the first surveyors of the digital landscape.
 It was familiar terrain for all;  so active talk we expected
&#150; and we wrangled and argued for two days about important
things, and about revolution. The last thing we expected to come
out of it all was a ringing, <I>solidarnosc</I> manifesto.
<P>
But something unexpected none the less remained.  A message runs
through the talk.  And it is a message, not for those in the know,
but for regular Americans, those to whom cyberspace is no more
than a breath of esoterica.  It is a message of needed fundamentals,
of things about big change that everyone should know.
<P>
We offer it in the form of the informal, of principles not for
incantation, but for reflection.  Words taken from the talk at
Aspen appear <I>&#147;like this.&#148;</I>
<P>
Here is our message.
<P>
<B><center>Cyberspace is not a medium, but a place.</B></center>
<P>
Before cyberspace, there was <I>the air waves</I>.  The old metaphor
was about how information traveled, how the ether took data packets
from one terminal to another.  And as a metaphor, the air waves
signaled a medium only, an agency that all wished to use;  a common,
and thus shared, instrumentality.
<P>
But cyberspace is a place.  We meet in the ether itself.  For
those who regularly play or do business there, it is even a temporary
habitation.  The new metaphor of a place becomes real;  even though
we are physically separate, our senses connect.  Information is
no longer data, but landscape.  At Aspen, when we reached for
words, they were concrete, world-words:  cyberspace as <I>&#147;ecosystem,&#148;
a new &#147;ecology,&#148;</I> <I>&#147;cyberspace is closer to
a datasphere or space of information.&#148;</I>  It has laid the
same claim on our imagination as a newly discovered country, a
frontier.  It is truly a new world.
<P>
We know it is a place because we think of it as a place.  We act
as though it is a place.  Groups of us meet there; we interact
there:  where <I>interact</I> is merely our new word for being
social.
<P>
Meaning we create human communities there.
<P>
Calling cyberspace a place is our fundamental first principle:
 first to change unstated habits of thought, and then the very
definitions of law.  It means that cyberspace is not a common
medium, a public good; which after the model of <I>the air waves</I>
needs government control and regulation if it is to be shared
as a commons.  Cyberspace is a realm, a sphere of permanent human
gathering and activity.  Primitive it is &#150; a digitally savage
place &#150; but it is, like the earliest American colonies, <B>in
the process of being settled</B>.  Since cyberspace is a created
place, our technology reach endows the possibility of its social
development, of its rise to civilization;  just as the evolution
of ships and the first computers &#150; sextant and astrolabe
&#150; made possible America itself.  So the first colonies in
cyberspace are like any other human experiments at living on a
distant shore.  They are experiments in society itself.
<P>
<B><center>The communities that grow there must be <br>private before they<I>
</I>are public.</B></center>
<P>
These experiments in cyberspace are pioneer communities, and they
may be the first stakeholders of a new society.  Not an alien
culture:  more like an extension of ourselves in a new, but very
different place.  And like any weak and distant settlement, the
new place seems oppressive in its harshness;  and from our far
away vantage &#150; like that of 17th century Londoners &#150;
it all seems primitive and strange.  And it is strange;  and the
unyielding strangeness of an alien world forces human social adaptation.
 People come to this new place with all the inherited social traditions
of late-industrial culture;  and it doesn&#146;t work that way
here.  Others have come in rebellion, or seeking sanctuary from
the tyranny of those traditions.  They want it all to be different.
<P>
What the cyber-colonists share is the desire to adapt, to be able
to be there, and stay there, and make it work.  That drives them;
 and that means, like so many fragile first settlements, that
they will find a way to make it work.  But that means finding
out above all what <I>does</I> work.
<P>
Culture is everywhere in us.  It teaches us how to arrange human
things, how to relate to one another.  And it urges us to make
rules that guide our thinking and our actions.  Law is only the
last form of human rule-making to appear.  Most societies rely
on custom and taboo; they save the law for community theater:
 a mix of teaching and collective observance.
<P>
Social rules &#150; custom and taboo as opposed to law &#150;
have become <I>private</I> in the modern sense:  that is, they
inhere to a community or group only, and are not officially owned
by the national society as a whole.  When social rules inhere
to the national society, they are no longer owned and exercised
by a community of <B>people</B>, but by the national <B>government</B>.
 This is the modern meaning of <I>public</I>.  Long ago, <I>public</I>
referred to the whole of a tribe, in a time when tribe and community
were the same word.  The industrial period separated public from
community.  The new nation state created a formal code of national
law that grew in to a superstructure of life:  it supplanted custom
and taboo for all groups, and replaced social rules with centralized
fiat.  Today, in everyday usage, public no longer means <I>of
the people</I>, it means that particular aspect of government
regulation of <I>everyone&#146;s</I> life.
<P>
Since cyberspace is still seen by America&#146;s centralized authority
as a public medium,  this authority seeks to regulate the new
ether as it did the air waves.  But suppose this authority affirmed
the new metaphor of cyberspace as a realm, colonized by pioneering
settlers?  Would the authority allow the new communities to create
their own rules?  Would it understand that old rules, hardened
into code and statute, might not fit the new place?<HR>

<P>
America&#146;s frontier communities grew up on their own.  The
British Crown did not interfere unduly in their <I>private</I>
life, even as this evolved into civic life, even to the level
of colonial assemblies.  And after we won our independence, young
America let communities continue to make their own rules.
<P>
<I>&#147;We are hearkening back to the old frontier.  At first
they spent an awful lot of time conquering the frontier and building
the frontier and making a society here where there was no one.
 And then they studied politics.&#148;</I>
<P>
Politics as governance should grow out of the traditions of community
rule.  But in industrial America rules have been codified on high,
and are imposed from above.  This reversal of original tradition
is suffered more or less passively by most citizens.  Those sodbusting
in cyberspace, however, are different.  They argue that regulation
for an industrial world will not work in the ether.  And they
are generally more &#145;ornery and defiant than most American
citizens.
<P>
Their message:  to colonize cyberspace,
<P>
<B><center>Custom must precede law.</center></B>
<P>
They want to build their own communities, not have them administered
by the state.  They insist that state-regulated human relations
in cyberspace will stunt, if not destroy, the growth of real society
there.
<P>
<I>&#147;This discussion is very evocative of communities in America
in the 18th century.  If you look at the communities that founded
America, many of them were fleeing a place of tyranny, and they
sought just to be unto themselves, and that was accepted originally
in America.  I think in some ways we have come full circle.&#148;</I>
<P>
Not just frontier spirit here, but a bit of <I>Allegheny Uprising</I>
too.  Cyberspace foments a rebellion against the Old Order.
<P>
<B><center>The new society is a successor society &#150; and so<br> a new
model.</B>
<P></center>
Why is this important?  This is surely the most marginal of frontier
societies.  Or is it?
<P>
What we call cyber-communities look more like encampments than
colonies.  But we tend to tie our image of community to the familial-neighborhood
icon only.  We forget that our economic intercourse is a highly
advanced network of business communities, marked by highly developed
sets of personal and group relationships.  In the US in fact,
a case can be made that the strongest personal ties that many
have are not family at all, but company and firm.  From core identity
to emotional investment, the communities of commerce define late
20th century America.
<P>
We call it The Marketplace.  And the new marketplace is moving
to the new place, cyberspace.  It is moving there because the
technologies of the ether <I>&#147;can make transaction costs
so small that we can eventually eliminate them.&#148;</I>  What
earthly market can say that?  And what market can ignore transaction
costs, when there is one that has none?
<P>
Like the ancient agora or bazaar, markets seek communities, and
communities cluster around the marketplace.  And as cyberspace
becomes a living social sphere, going to market there is not just
a response to zero transaction costs;  it is like going downtown
in the old city.  Communities actually, and increasingly, inhabit
the same space as the new marketplace.  Cyberspace begins to lose
its frontier edges, and edges into <I>Boom Town</I>.  More and
more people enter the ether and work there.  They don&#146;t just
get info dumps on their terminal;  the terminal becomes their
vehicle, their wheels into cyberspace.  So the new society gets
serious, and gets beyond the BBS, through the social network of
enterprise.
<P>
And because of business, the new society truly promises to succeed
the old.  It succeeds because it lets everything work faster,
better, and with higher confidence.  And it is open:  everything
is there to see.  Open markets have always worked on trust, and
each advance in transaction has been built on it.  Transparency
is its own enforcement.
<P>
Which means that the very nature of the cyberspace urges a ethos
of trust.  Transparency reaffirms the power of ostracism;  it
encourages virtue as no law of the land can.  What openness does
to business deadbeats, it does in a much larger sense for the
new society:  it renews the strength of custom over law, of group
rules self-defined over regulation by government authority.  And
it is fairer by far.  If <I>&#147;value is determined by the trust
that people have and can be engaged directly so as to define their
own currency even,&#148;</I> then each of us has the power to
shape our own value according to our actions.
<P>
So a new ethic in the marketplace at last comes home:  and the
far shores of a new world brings us back to the Atlantic shore
of our earliest ancestors;  back to that confidence in their values
and beliefs that is their charge to us.
<P>
<B><center>It threatens the old, and the old order seeks<br> to kill or stunt
it.</B></center>
<P>
But in this promise of progress is a problem.
<P>
<I>&#147;If markets are going to get immeasurably better, it should
be possible to return to the market many things that are handed
to government.&#148;</I>
<P>
Or, cyberspace as the main threat to the Old Order.
<P>
It took the American colonies almost two centuries to become a
threat to Britain&#146;s established order.  And it took long
war and a financial crisis to disrupt a century-long pattern of
British benign neglect of rule.
<P>
No such hope exists for cyberspace.  To the Old Order, the threat
of cyberspace is like the Industrial and the French revolutions
rolled into one.
<P>
<I>&#147;The fact that a system is chaotic and not capable of
control by old institutions, does not necessarily mean that it
is going to blow up like a bomb.&#148;</I>
<P>
Ah, but that is exactly how imperial Washington sees cyberspace.
 In its eyes it resembles a bomb in every respect:  it ticks like
a bomb, it is fused to blow in a finite period of time, and its
explosive power is enough to bring down the old house.
<P>
And the pioneers know it:
<P>
<I>&#147;When we start using phrases like </I>Government as the
Engine of Progress<I>, then we are deep into machine think and
machine language.&#148; ... &#147;The old machine model came out
with a perfect Hoover blueprint for everything.  Everything has
to be under control. Everything has to be in balance.  All the
pieces have to fit together.  But the machine can&#146;t evolve
or change.  And I think what we are engaged in now is the disassembly
of that super bureaucratic apparatus.&#148;</I>
<P>
or,
<P>
<I>&#147;We should be examining very critically just which freedoms
really need government to be protected&#148; ... &#147;Before
we hand back to government or say to government, oh yes, you get
to protect all our freedoms, we should ask critically just which
ones we can protect for ourselves ...&#148;</I>
<P>
All we have to do is listen to our own words.
<P>
So &#147;telecom&#148; legislation brought forward by the <I>ancien
regime</I> is offered as public reform or public protection, but
it is intended to freeze evolution.  It would be like Charles
II forbidding all ship departures from Bristol to British North
America.  Of course, that would have been a form of royal self-mutilation.
 It was beyond the 17th century imagination.
<P>
But not beyond of the mind of the late 20th century imperial bureaucrat:
<P>
<I>&#147;We are in a world with ever-increasing regulatory tentacles
reaching throughout the system, and even now beginning to invade
the information economy itself and strangle it  ...&#148;</I>
<P>
or,
<P>
<I>&#147;What we need is for telephone companies with their tremendous
fiber capacity to link to the broad band connections to homes
that cable companies now possess to create a broad band infrastructure
for the Internet.  But because regulators prohibit this natural
evolution ... capital is fleeing from the Internet ... to Hollywood.&#148;</I>
<P>
The irony is that forcing new world builders to compete over &#147;content&#148;
drives telecom back to the social universe of couch potato-TV;
 back to the stupefying, one-way feed box of industrial information
... back to the vision of George Orwell.
<P>
Back to the cultural compass of the 1950s?  Back to the future?
<P>
<B><center>We need to protect the new from the old, <br>while it is still
vulnerable.</center></B>
<P>
No regime has ever stopped relentless change.  Revolutions happen;
 the Soviet <I>nomenclatura</I> had not enough T-72s to stop theirs,
and our Imperial City has not enough Clipper Chips or Senators
Exxon to starve out the brash settlements on the Net.  But they
can slow it down, divert its course for awhile, give us all grief.
<P>
But what we have made in cyberspace is revolution&#146;s start.
 We don&#146;t have to worry about what it will do:  we know full
well what it will do.  What we must do is fight like hell to give
this juggernaut &#150; just like yesterday&#146;s locomotive of
progress &#150; its History-breaking head of steam.
<P>
<I>&#147;I am convinced that federal level government is an industrial
era artifact that arose to protect the interests of large industrial
institutions and will go away with them.&#148;</I>

<P>
At the dawn of this century that is soon to conclude, one of man's
great discoveries was just beginning to blossom.  Albert Einstein's
explanation of the photoelectric effect led to an entirely new
body of knowledge that we now call &quot;quantum mechanics.&quot;
 It allows us to to understand, and therefore to manipulate, the
intricate workings of matter itself.  One of the more pervasive
examples of what quantum mechanics made possible is the phenomenon
we know as quantum tunnelling--the basis for semiconductor electronics.
 And I say &quot;pervasive&quot; because it is man's harnessing
of that microscopic phenomenon of tunnelling that is causing the
widespread change we are here to discuss.  Tunelling enables microelectronics
which, in turn, permits the cost of digital computing to decline
so rapidly that it is becoming pervasive--like the grains of sand
from which its semiconductors are made.
<P>
When all those computers are connected so that they can communicate,
the result is cyberspace.  The technological evolution from quantum
mechanics to cyberspace has been gradual and even orderly.  What
is more abrupt, however, is the transformation which our cultures,
economies and even our societies are undergoing as a result.
<P>
One reason our cultures are changing is that young people, whose
learning experience has occurred in the midst of pervasive computing--that
is, with the personal computer,  are somehow different than preceding
generations.  One of my colleagues, a recent college graduate,
has a sign on the door to her office which states &quot;Only the
Digital Shall Enter!&quot;  When I asked her to explain its significance,
she described a &quot;digital&quot; person as one who is quick
to accept change, generally optimistic but resistant of central
authority.  The digital, she said, sense intuitively that small
is preferable to large.  Moreover, I was informed that digital
people tend to be young, although she allowed that I was an exception.
 Clearly, her digital generation has accumulated a different set
of experiences, has somewhat different values, and possesses a
more positive outlook about the future than do the previous, &quot;analog&quot;
generations.  It is, in fact, a different culture.
<P>
 So too is today's economy somehow different.  For more than two
hundred years, industrial economies were characterized by one
overarching feature--the accumulation of barriers to new entrants.
 Whether through economies-of-scale, proximity to resources, regulation,
or simply by establishing a strong brand-name, industrial economies
built barriers to new entrants.  Those barriers were present in
all markets, whether local, regional or national, and for virtually
all goods and services, from Coca Cola to clothing to airlines.
<P>
New entrants could, of course, emerge but the barriers were high.
 In the new economy, those barriers are much lower and, in some
cases, nearly absent.  As recently as ten years ago, few would
have predicted that IBM's market capitalization on the New York
Stock Exchange would be surpassed by a software company.  But,
two years ago, that happened, when the value of Microsoft's shares
exceeded IBM's.  In fact, the value of Microsoft today is nearly
as large as the combined worth of General Motors and Ford.  One
expression of the new economics that is often heard in Silicon
Valley is referred to as &quot;The Law of the Installed Base.&quot;
 It says that, when technological change occurs, which is becoming
more and more often, whoever has an installed base of customers
is at greater risk than a new entrant.  And few companies are
more aware of that law than Microsoft and Intel.
<P>
With so many of our citizens, especially younger people, becoming
digital, and with barriers to new enterprises falling rapidly,
it is hardly surprising that the very nature of our society is
also changing.  What is remarkable, however, is the similarity
between <I>HOW</I> both our societies and computer architectures
are changing, and the speed with which it is taking place.  In
each instance, the overarching trend is toward becoming more distributed.
 Mainframes, those symbols of centralized power, are being replaced,
steb by step, by distributed computing.  In fact, one of the main
debates in computing circles today is whether the asymptote of
this trend will be the computer merging into the digital network.
 While I very much doubt that conclusion, it is not impossible.
 What is startling, however, is that so much of this change occurred
in little more than a decade.
<P>
So far, I have stressed two points. The first is that it is the
plummeting cost of digital computing that is driving the change
to new cultures, economies and societies, what Alvin and Heidi
Toffler have described as the transition from the &quot;second
wave&quot; industrial age to the &quot;third wave&quot; knowledge
age.  My second point is that the defining feature of that transition,
and what most distinguishes third wave behavior from second wave,
is diminshed barriers to new entrants.  Nowhere is the divergent
nature of those two behaviors manifested more clearly than in
the two terms most often used in the discussion over digital connection--Information
Superhighway and Cyberspace.
<P>
The second-wave term information superhighway connotes rigid physical
limits connecting concentrated, centralized elements.  Cyberspace,
in contrast, is characterized by its lack of limits and by its
distributed, decentralized nature.  The information superhighway
presupposes immutable laws of conservation--what goes north on
the highway must return south, whereas in cyberspace we assume
that, since the cost of replication is negligible, the amount
of information consumed vastly exceeds production.  As one of
my distinguished colleagues, Peter Huber, has expressed it, &quot;we
all run information deficits in cyberspace.&quot;
<P>
Superhighways tend to be government owned, operated by bureaucracies,
and with limited access.  Cyberspace, with the Internet as its
initial manifestation, has a vast array of ownerships, is operated
by empowered individuals, and with virtually unlimited access.
<P>
Having said what cyberspace is not, let me be clear about what
it is.  Expressed in the barest of terms, <I>cyberspace is the
culture and society of  people who are individually empowered
by digital connection.  The digital connection that enables cyberspace
is ubiquitous and non-hierarchal, peer-to-peer in architecture.</I>
 The result is an abundance of information, readily available,
with an economy characterized by its low barriers to new entrants.
<P>
One of, if not the, fundamental dilemmas of cyberspace resides
in the nature and ownership of property.  Our experience tells
us that clear and enforceable property rights are necessary for
markets to work.  Moreover, defining those property rights is
a central role of government.  Law, as we know it, was developed
to protect those rights.  In the Toffler's first wave, which was
agriculturally based, law was required to establish ownership,
and thereby ensure order, of the principal source of production,
land.  In the second wave, manufacturing became the economic driver,
and the structure of modern law grew around the centralized institutions
that needed protection for their reserves of capital, manpower,
and hardware.  In each of those earlier economic systems, maintaining
stability was the important factor in defining property rights.
<P>
Their laws were designed to preserve the predictability necessary
to either land stewardship or capital formation.  In the third
wave we have now entered, information to a large extent replaces
land, capital, and machines.  And, since digital technology is
separating information from the physical world where first and
second wave property law found definition, it should come as no
surprise that the third wave is bringing a fundamental shift in
the purposes and methods of law.  In fact, that fundamental shift
is likely to extend beyond those statutes that govern just intellectual
property.
<P>
The dilemma is this:  if digital property can be reproduced and
distributed instantaneously, everywhere and without cost, without
our knowledge, without its even leaving our possession, how can
we protect it?  How are we going to get paid for the work we do
with our minds?  And, if we can't get paid, what will assure the
continued creation and distribution of such work?
<P>
Today's copyright and patent law is based upon the <I>physical
expression</I> of ideas or knowledge.  Books, newsprint, tapes
and CDs are tangible means to preserve property rights under present
law.  They simply don't exist in cyberspace.  Instead, value is
obtained more by the way the information is presented than by
its content.
<P>
New software is often introduced at no cost to the user, but with
the expectation that he or she, having invested time and effort
in learning to use it, will pay for next-generation upgrades.
 Providers of information that is timely can extract a fee for
property that will, tomorrow, be free.  Such intangible features
as ease and efficiency of use, quality of presentation, timeliness
and format--those are the kinds of things that represent value
in a cyberspace economy.  As another of my distinguished colleagues,
John Perry Barlow, has so aptly pointed out, &quot;whether you
think of yourself as a service provider or a performer, the future
protection of your intellectual property will depend on your ability
to control your relationship to the market--a relationship that
will most likely live and grow over time.  The value of that relationship
will reside in the quality of performance, the uniqueness of your
point of view, the validity of your expertise, its relevance to
your market, and, underlying everything, the ability of that market
to access your creative services swiftly, conveniently, and interactively.&quot;
 
<P>
In spite of our experience to the contrary, how ideas are presentated
in cyberspace will be more important than the ideas themselves.
 I think of providing value in cyberspace as constructing elements
of the ultimate digital-to-analog interface--matching the overabundance
of available, digital information to the inherent, analog limitations
of we human beings.
<P>
And that diverts me, for a moment, to a subject that perturbs
me.  That is the obsessive fascination with bandwidth that contributes
so much confusion to the all-important matter of converting our
existing communications systems from outmoded analog, designed
largely for voice service, to the kind of digital infrastructure
required for cyberspace.
<P>
My concern derives from what I will call the &quot;30-30 rule&quot;--that
we humans can take in information at only about 30 megahertz through
our eyes or, even slower, at 30 kilohertz through our ears.  This,
ultimately, is the requirement that will shape the communications
infrastructure of cyberspace.  Much higher bandwidth is, of course,
required for machine-to-machine communications, between elements
of the network, but it is at the man-machine interface where the
maximum value is added.  The focus upon bandwidth is, I fear,
a result of our second wave experience, where it is the movement
of information that is valued, not its presentation.  Regulators
and deregulators would better focus on making it easier to convert
our analog telecommunications systems to digital infrastructures,
rather than on maximizing bandwidth.
<P>
Bandwidth is important, because it will make connected computing
richer, but the fact remains that we humans lack a broadband input
channel to access all that bandwidth directly.  And, in the meantime,
it is digital connection, to link together those ever more pervasive
computers, that we need, even more than bandwidth.
<P>
I have spoken of the importance of re-examining the appropriateness
of current copyright and patent law, because the central premises
of cyberspace differ so markedly from our first and second wave
experience.  And I have stressed that the value received for how
information is presentated is outweighing its content.  Let me
go further, and suggest that copyright and patent laws will, gradually
but inexorably, prove to be outmoded in cyberspace.  Based on
largely irrelevant, physical premises, and unable to adapt to
the pace of technological progress in cyberspace, they simply
will be abandoned.
<P>
Peter Huber has proposed something that, to me, makes much more
sense.  That is that the body of common law, developed from judicial
decisions based on custom and precedent, is more adaptable to
change and better able to provide the essential protections that
are needed in cyberspace.  Although, at first that may seem a
radical proposal, it in fact returns to a well-established mechanism
of resolving disputes--the courts.  It allows accomodation to
change, within ethical bounds and, in contrast to copyright and
patent law, common law is not tied to a rigid requirement that
property be physical in nature.
<P>
Among the already-digital, there is another, more technical, feature
of cyberspace that allows the individual providers of information
to protect their digital property.  That is encryption, but not
in the usual sense of government controlled encryption.  It is
encryption in the sense that the creators of digital property
can use technology, in the form of software tools, to contain,
restrict, or meter the use of their ideas.  This, of course, encompasses
much more than enciphering and deciphering information.  For example,
in the language of object orientation, it means creating &quot;agents&quot;
to build and maintain the relationship between the creator and
customer.
<P>
Drawing liberally from John Perry Barlow, let me summarize his
thoughts on property in cyberspace:
<P>
 The protections that we will develop will rely far more on ethics
and technology than on law.
<P>
 Encryption will be the technical basis for most intellectual
property protection. (And should, for this and other reasons,
be made more widely available.)
<P>
 The economy of the future will be based on relationship rather
than possession. It will be continuous rather than sequential.
<P>
Along with the diminished barriers to new entrants that define
the cyberspace economy go diminished economies-of-scale.  Taken
together, they mark the decline of the concept of a monopoly or,
at least, of an enduring monopoly.  This is but another way of
restating what I referred to earlier as &quot;the law of the installed
base.&quot;  With technological progress opening new ways to serve
yesterday's markets, one-time monopolies are being replaced by
competitive battlegrounds.  Even where monopolies do emerge, the
pace of technological change is threatening to make them short-lived.
 This is true not only for digital technology, but for all the
goods and services in cyberspace.  The reason, as George Gilder
has pointed out, is because the very nature of competition in
cyberspace is different.
<P>
Second wave static competition, whereby many providers compete
to sell similar products at the lowest price is, of course, good
because it brings more value to the customer.  But the dynamic
competition of cyberspace, where different industries with different
technologies compete to meet customer's needs, is even better.
 It is better because it allows competing technologies and new
products to challenge the old ones and, if they really are better,
to replace them.  Static competition will lead to faster and stronger
horses, but dynamic competion gives us the automobile.  One need
only look at what is happening in such entrenched areas as the
market for mail, where fax machines and overnight delivery challenge
the public monopoly, or in television, where cable and satellite-TV
have broken the monopoly of broadcast, or the change that is underway
in voice telephony.
<P>
Such dynamic competition--the essence of what the Austrian economist
Joseph Schumpeter called &quot;creative destruction,&quot; is
the nature of the cyberspace economy.  Nowhere are the results
more dramatic than in our own computer industry and, in particular,
in Silicon Valley, California.  A negative view might be that
there has been so much destruction, so many companies were born,
flourished, and died.  But that can only be viewed as a modest
price to pay for the wholescale economic rejuvenation of the United
States that it catalyzed.  And, not surprisingly, that renewed
competitiveness is concentrated in the more important areas of
high growth, such as computing, telecommunications, pharmaceuticals,
and the broad array of service segments.  In many ways, I look
at Silicon Valley as the first colony of cyberspace.
<P>
There are many things one can already observe about the cyberspace
economy.  Although many features are still obscured, good data
abound.  But we know much less about how people adapt to cyberspace.
 We do, however, have strong indications that that adaptation
is not easy.  And I point to the simple fact that, in my own country,
although we have experienced a generally healthy economy and low
unemployment for more than a decade, there is a widespread sense
of uncertainty, even anxiety, about the future.  Yet we are progressing,
inexorably, toward a cyberspace society.  To gain some insight
into how that is occurring, it is informative to look at the changing
natures of individual freedom, the community and of government.
<P>
Perhaps the first manifestation of the new nature of individual
freedom is what we call the &quot;hacker,&quot; that completely
digital young person who ignored most of our social pressures
and rules to develop a set of computer skills through an early
and intense exposure to the Personal Computer--the PC.  Those
skills eventually made the hacker highly marketable.  He or she
became a technician, an inventor and, in many cases, a creator
of new wealth.  None is better known than Bill Gates, who chose
founding Microsoft over social pressure to continue his Harvard
education.
<P>
The hacker is neither a rare nor an unimportant feature in America
today.  Where parents once presumed the hacker would learn the
ways of conventional America, it is conventional America that
is learning the ways of the hacker.  By choosing individuality
over conformity, performance over concensus, the hacker became
our frontiersmen in cyberspace.
<P>
The nature of freedom was redefined in the transition to the industrial
age.  The second wave relied on standardization, and its institutions,
corporate and government bureaucracies, reflected conformity.
 It might even have made sense that, in some cases, a government
would prohibit entrepreneurs from entering new markets.  It might
even have made sense that, in a world of one-way broadcast communications,
a government would assume ownership over the spectrum and limit
the viewpoints expressed there.  Those kinds of infringements
on individual freedom were made in order for the system to &quot;work.&quot;
 They make little sense in cyberspace.  The sheer complexity of
the third wave is simply too great for any centrally planned bureaucracy
to manage.  Demassification, customization, individuality and
freedom--these are the natural features of cyberspace.
<P>
If the hacker is the pioneer, the frontiersman in cyberspace,
then his early communities may be on the internet.  The internet
is, in itself, a paradox.  As the first step toward the kind of
digital connection that enables cyberspace, ubiquitous and non-hierarchal,
it is also a step toward conforming--at least to a common connection
standard.  But there is little conformity in the way the internet
is used.  Copyright laws are, generally, ignored; propriety is
eschewed for the explicit; and privacy is more a challenge than
a right.
<P>
But, in spite of this seeming paradox, there is both order and
an emerging sense of community on the internet.  There is order
because software is being introduced, rapidly, both to make the
internet easier to access, use and explore, and to make it more
palatable, whether through encryption for privacy or censoring
software.  And there is community because &quot;electronic neighbourhoods&quot;
are proliferating, bound together not by geography but by common
interests.
<P>
My own son, studying for his doctorate in Buddhist history, is
part of a global internet community of like-minded scholars. 
On a more mundane level, my own love of Bassett Hound dogs is
shared with a community of people with similar friendships.  What
matters is that these relationships are the kind of glue that
hold communities together, and they are new.
<P>
Looking beyond this first phase of experience with the digital
connection, we can see the broader effects of reduced pressure
on highways, less air pollution, and diminished concentration
of population in urban areas.  This is more than a mere optimist's
speculation; more and more companies are accepting the home office
as a legimitate part of the modern institution.  The SOHO, a new
acronym for &quot;small office, home office,&quot; is the fastest
growing segment of the American PC market.
<P>
Whereas we have much to learn about the nature of society in cyberspace,
we can be sure it will be more distributed, and decentralized
than in the past.  And all indications are that it will be composed
of less heterogeneous communities, linked more by common interests
than by common location.  One could envision this trend as, in
fact, a renewed sense of community, sort of a return to the first
wave agrarian community.  What is different, of course, is the
lack of common physical location<I>.</I>
<P>
However one perceives the cyberspace community, whether as a return
to the past or as something utterly new, the connection between
them is far more likely to be a weaker one than the kind of governments
we have now.  Taking the early internet communities as examples,
the very sameness of interests that binds them will create an
expanded diversity among them.  Or, conversely, communities in
cyberspace will simply be affected less by what happens in other
communities.
<P>
And that brings me to my final point, which pertains to the nature
of national government in cyberspace.  I remain a skeptic when
I hear talk, generally more hypothetical than factual, that nations
are becoming less well-defined, with borders succumbing to international
commerce.  If anything, the common bonds of language, culture
and religion that tie nations together are becoming even stronger,
it seems.  I see no evidence that it will be different in cyberspace.
 What I do see as different is the nature of government in cyberspace.
 Just as surely as economies of scale and barriers to entry, those
twin bastions of the second wave industrial era, are diminishing,
so too will the concept of today's centralized, bureaucratic state.
 And it is already happening.  The question is no longer whether
second wave governments are in remission, but rather what will
the governments of cyberspace look like?
<P>
First, and in order to not be irrelevant, it must be &quot;digital.&quot;
 That means it must recognize that change--the greatest fear of
all bureaucracies--can be beneficial, and that enabling the citizens
of cyberspace is the only acceptable path to success.   To be
sure, this sounds so utopian as to be suspect.  On the proactive
side, ask yourselves what IBM is having to learn to survive and
why Microsoft and Intel thrive; or why Washington is so enthusiastic
to return authority to the fifty states.  On the more reactive
side, ask why France is experiencing so much turmoil, or why the
highly regulated telecommunications industry is so slow to change
compared to the computer industry.
<P>
Massive, widespread decentralization is already, irreversably
underway.  Sometimes welcomed, sometimes resisted, the trend is
hardly disputable.  New dimensions of individual freedom, manifested
by the renewed dominance of the consumer, are already underway,
in virtually all markets.  In this broad sense, defined by my
young colleague with the sign over her door prohibiting all but
the &quot;digital&quot; to enter, the world is becoming &quot;digital.&quot;
<P>
Second, governments in cyberspace will learn to follow their citizens,
adapting to changes in their societies.  The concept of who best
represents the &quot;elite&quot; will change, as I think it already
is in America.  I recently had the priviledge of sharing a few
hours over dinner with Newt Gingrich, certainly the most powerful
politician in America, and Bill Gates.  Let me assure you there
was no doubt as to whom was the role model for young Americans.
 Bill Gates may have been too modest to see himself in that role,
but Newt made him aware.
<P>
Let me summarize my main points.  Cyberspace is not a surrealistic
future that we confront, it is already upon us.  The global economy
is being shaped by it, and Microsoft's surpassing IBM's value
is tangible proof.  Moreover, cyberspace is not an abstraction--simply
expressed, it is the culture and society of  people who are individually
empowered by digital connection.  The digital connection that
enables cyberspace is ubiquitous and non-hierarchal.  The result
is an abundance of information, readily available, with an economy
characterized by its low barriers to new entrants, and diminished
economies-of-scale.  What is important about the requisite infrastructural
change is the conversion from analog to digital, far more than
the inevitable increase in bandwidth.  Property in cyberspace,
no longer a physical entity, cannot be protected by copyright
and patent laws, but instead needs to rely for protection on ethics
and technolgy.  The body of common law may be a practical means
to achieve that.  Dynamic competition, among new and different
industries and technologies, will replace the static competition
of the industrial age.
<P>
The culture and society of cyberspace may be best understood by
viewing &quot;hackers&quot; as the first inhabitants of cyberspace.
 Rejecting the social pressures and rules of the second wave,
they represent the digital mindset that is rejuvenating the American
economy.  With highly marketable skills in distributed computing
and networking, obtained in nonconforming ways, hackers have become
an essential means for institutions to reject second wave habits.
 Via the internet, they are creating the first third-wave society,
comprised of electronic communities.
<P>
Taken together, these are the observable elements in the transition
from the second wave, industrial age to cyberspace.  To complete
this transition, governments must become more decentralized and
more progressive, adapting to cyberspace, along with their citizens.

<B>Summary of Testimony</B>
<P>
 Important as the Telecommunications Act of 1996 is, important systemic
telecommunications reforms are still needed.  Although some federal and state
regulation remains appropriate, experience has now shown that industries
governed by market forces generally work better than government-run or
regulated ones:<p>
<ul>
<li>    Markets produce objective information on how consumers and producers value
resources and strong incentives to act on this information.  The FCC's delay
of cellular is estimated to have cost America over $80 billion.<p>
<li>    Competitors often use the regulatory process  to delay innovation and
competition by several years or even decades.  Consider customer premises
equipment, long distance yesterday and today, cable, video dial tone, VHF
drop-ins, low power TV, and DBS.<p>
<li>    The pace of technical change, especially regarding digital technologies,
has increased the cost of regulation.  Digital technologies make most
regulatory distinctions between voice and data and video just plain silly.
In accordance with these principles, much of the FCC's current responsibility
should be devolved to the states, transferred to the Department of Justice
and most important of all committed to the marketplace, in the end the true
agency of consumer protection.<p>  
</ul>
First, most federal price and profit regulation of telecom markets should be
eliminated, either because the relevant markets are effectively competitive,
regulation is better left to the states, or such federal regulation is
counterproductive.  Possible forbearance targets recommended by some members
of  the Progress & Freedom Foundation Working Group are attached to my
testimony.  They include tariffing, service bundling, and self-certification
reforms.<p>
Second, the electromagnetic spectrum should be largely privatized. Existing
spectrum licensees should be given freedom to use their spectrum as they see
fit as long as they do not interfere with other licensees--their cochannel
and adjacent channel neighbors.  Unallocated private and underutilized
federal spectrum should be made available in flexible assignments through
auctions.  A detailed proposal for reforming the electromagnetic spectrum
developed by members of the PFF Working Group is attached to my testimony.
Third, much of the FCC's general public interest authority is better
exercised elsewhere.  Attempts to address the broader public interest by
assuring there is adequate children's programming, by regulating mergers, or
by conducting international negotiations should be handled by Congress or
state legislatures in explicit actions or by other agencies such as the
Department of Justice or State.<p>
The case for dramatic reform is now more compelling than ever before.
 Growing global competition, merging markets, and the revolution in digital
and related technologies make the unintended and untoward effects of
government regulation far more costly than in the past.  A regulatory
framework that slows innovation in this area, despite any plausible shortrun
efficiency gains it might achieve, will foreclose a tremendous opportunity
for the American people.

<B>Testimony</B>
<P>
Introduction<br>
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  It is an honor to be here to testify before this
Committee about the restructuring of the Federal Communications Committee.
 As you know I worked at the FCC for eight years in the 1980s, first as Chief
of the Office of Plans and Policy then as Chief of Staff to Chairman Dennis
Patrick.  Since then I have been in private practice, an adjunct professor at
Georgetown University Law Center, and an adjunct fellow at The Hudson
Institute and The Progress & Freedom Foundation.  I am a member of the PFF
Working Group that last May proposed eliminating most of the FCC's current
functions over the next three years.  Today I am representing PFF and myself
and no one else.<p>
This Congress and this Committee are to be congratulated for passage of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996 which creates a new legal and policy playing
field based on the presumption that competition, open entry and market forces
should regulate the telecom industry.  Important as that legislation is, and
it is the most important telecommunications legislation of the last 60 years,
important telecommunications reforms are still needed.  Some might benefit
from legislation.  Others only require diligent oversight by this Committee.
I want to address four broad points.  First,  I want to lay out the case for
 reform.  Second, I will list the structural reforms that should be
implemented over time.  Third, I will discuss reforms that the FCC should
undertake today.  Finally, I want to stress the importance of these reforms
to the American people.<p>
Before I begin I want to be clear about what I am saying and not saying: <br>
<ul>
<li>	I am not here to proclaim the end of communications history.  I am not
saying that all communications regulation by all agencies, federal and state,
is inappropriate.  <p>

<li>	Nor am I saying that my policy prescriptions could be implemented
overnight.  Indeed, even with a free hand, it might take two or three years
to transition to a new system.  As an aside,  additional resources should be
given to the FCC to meet the legislation's mandates, but only if this
Committee is satisfied that the FCC is doing everything it should to pare
back through forbearance and privatization. <p>

<li>	My message is not partisan.  My criticisms of the FCC are systemic.  They
cross administrations.  They span the decades.  Time and again and to this
day well intentioned regulation has hurt consumers, often the poor and those
least well represented in the Washington regulatory game.<p>

<li>	Lastly, because in my eight years at the FCC I got to know many FCC
employees first hand, it is important to me to make explicit that my comments
are not intended to be a criticism of  FCC employees, who perform their jobs
in an exemplary fashion.  The cost of the FCC is not salaries.  The
overriding costs of the FCC are the foregone benefits of competition and
innovation.<p>

Why Dramatic Reform Is Needed<br>
Why replace the FCC?  What's wrong with regulation?   Experience has now
shown us that industries governed by market forces generally work better than
government-run or regulated ones--competition regulates prices and profits
better than the administrative process.  Markets produce objective
information on how consumers and producers value resources and strong
incentives to both to act on this information.  <p>
Regulation, in contrast, comes up short on both counts.  Regulators lack the
necessary information and the proper incentive needed to make prudent
decisions that will most benefit consumers.<p>
Consider spectrum allocation decisions, e.g., the cellular mobile radio and
VHF television allocations were billion dollar debacles.  The FCC's delay of
cellular is estimated to have cost America over $80 billion.  Consider too
the government's current  use of the 6 to 10 GHz of spectrum below 30 GHz
spectrum.  Most experts outside government believe that that spectrum is
underutilized.  <p>
A second failing of the regulatory process is that it is often used by
competitors to delay innovation and competition by several years or even
decades.  Few companies and no trade association can resist the temptation to
use the regulatory process to stymie a competitor or delay a new entrant.
 Most of those efforts have injured consumers.  When it comes to
communications pleadings H.L. Mencken's quip is surely right, &quot;It may be a
sin to think evil of others, but it is seldom a mistake.&quot;  Again let's look
at the record.  It's replete with examples of where regulation impeded
competition and new service such as customer premises equipment, long
distance yesterday and today, cable, video dial tone, VHF drop-ins, low power
TV, and DBS.  <p>
The pace of technical change, especially regarding the digital technologies,
has increased the cost of regulation.  In the old days it was ridiculous for
the FCC to allocate land mobile frequencies on a nationwide basis to narrow
industries, such as taxis and forestry management.  The inevitable
consequence was an overallocation of frequencies to taxis in Boise and an
underallocation in New York City and vice versa for forestry management
frequencies.  Digital technologies make most distinctions between voice and
data and video just as silly and far more expensive.<p>
What Structural Reforms Are Needed<br>
What's the answer?  As this Committee and Congress have recognized in the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, it is to rely more on market forces.  Where
regulation is necessary to check market power, it should seek to preserve the
information-producing  and feedback mechanism of the marketplace.  Subsidies
should be explicit and competitively neutral to minimize their distortive
effect.  Deferring to state regulators and employing case-by-case mechanisms
such as the common law rather than imposing nationwide structural rules will
maximize the opportunity for experimentation.<p>
In accordance with these principles, the current FCC should be replaced with
a much smaller federal agency.  Much of the FCC's current responsibility
should be devolved to the states, transferred to the Department of Justice
and most important of all committed to the marketplace, in the end the true
agency of consumer protection.<p>
FCC regulation can be divided into three parts.  First, there is utility
regulation, that is, the regulation of natural monopoly and universal
service.  Most federal price and profit regulation of telecom markets should
be eliminated, either because the relevant markets are effectively
competitive, regulation is better left to the states, or such federal
regulation is counterproductive.  States should be given principal
responsibility for defining universal service and any federal universal
service subsidies should be made explicit and means-tested.  Regulation of
local exchange facilities should be devolved to the states, subject to
federal guidelines necessary to the development of local competition  and the
assurance that interstate users of local exchange facilities have non
discriminatory access.  I discuss possible forbearance targets below.  
Second, the management of the electromagnetic spectrum should be largely
privatized.  Electromagnetic spectrum allocation decisions should be made
principally by private parties in the marketplace.  Existing spectrum
licensees should be given freedom to use their spectrum as they see fit as
long as they do not interfere with other licensees--their cochannel and
adjacent channel neighbors.  Unallocated private and underutilized federal
spectrum should be made available in flexible assignments.  The assignment of
spectrum should be made through the use of auctions where there are competing
applicants.  I have attached  a detailed proposal for reforming the
electromagnetic spectrum developed by members of the PFF Working Group.  
Third, much of the FCC's general public interest authority is better
exercised elsewhere.  Attempts to address the broader public interest by
assuring there is adequate children's programming, by regulating mergers,  or
by conducting international negotiations should be handled by  Congress or
state legislatures in explicit actions or other agencies such as the
Department of Justice or State.  Regulation of mergers should be done through
antitrust enforcement, not structural rules.  Any federal regulation of
programming content should be by explicit subsidy through legislation or
enforcement in federal court.<p>

Forbearance Actions That Can Be Taken Immediately<br>
The Commission should immediately undertake several deregulatory initiatives
that would benefit consumers, promote competition, and reduce its budgetary
needs.  Some of these initiatives are made possible, indeed required, by the
Telecommunications Act of 1996.   Section 401 of the new law adds a new
provision to the 1934 Communications Act, as amended (new 47 U.S.C. section
160) which requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to forbear
from regulating telecommunications carriers or services, under certain
circumstances.  Other initiatives, especially those that do not pertain to
telecommunications services, can be done under previous Commission authority
and discretion.  For example, the Commission can use self certification and
updated licensing procedures to speed up license transfers and reduce its
resource needs.  Other functions, especially handling public inquiries, could
be streamlined and possibly privatized. <p>
As the Commission seeks to promote competition, it should not delay the
forbearance process.  These and other initiatives should be taken to begin
the FCC's smooth transition to a competitive environment.  Congress should
give the FCC  flexibility to adjust its processes and move its personnel to
expedite this process.  An initial list of forbearance and privatization
proposals prepared by members of the PFF Working Group is attached.  Some of
those recommendations are:<br>
Private Carriage Contracts.  Private carriage promotes competition, the
satisfaction of customers' demand for tailored offerings, and the avoidance
of unnecessary regulatory costs.  There is no good reason to require AT&T,
MCI, Sprint, or other long distance firms to file single-customer offerings.
 Typically, these single-customer offerings appeal to the largest
communications customers, firms which spend millions (and, in several
instances, hundreds of millions) of dollars annually, and which have large,
sophisticated in-house communications staff.  Extensive FCC tariffing
requirements thus serve little of the customer protection role traditionally
associated with tariffing.  Instead, those requirements have become at best
an unneeded  expense and, at worst, a means of price signaling and
coordination.<p>

Computer Inquiry Rules.  The new forbearance law should be applied to
Computer Inquiry rules that prohibit carriers from bundling various services
and equipment and impose other unnecessary requirements.  For example, all
long distance and regional Bell operating companies are prohibited from
bundling basic services with either customer premises equipment or enhanced
services.  Also, AT&T and the Bell companies must:<br>
<ol>
<li> get prior FCC approval of enhanced affiliates' interconnection plans.<p>
<li> disclose changes in basic network interfaces.<p>
 <li> file non-discrimination reports allocate joint and common costs incurred in the provision of basic and
enhanced services.<p>
<li>  In all these cases, where the FCC determines the basic
service involved is effectively competitive, the regulation is no longer
necessary or productive.<p>   
</ul>
Dominant Carrier Reforms.  Steps should be taken to simplify FCC price and
profit regulation of telecommunications companies still deemed to command
&quot;market power.&quot;  The FCC needs to move toward a regime of price, not profit
regulation, by adopting a &quot;pure&quot; incentives-based (&quot;price caps&quot;) regulatory
system, along the lines followed by Britain's progressive Office of Telecommunications. 
 The FCC's current approach &quot;caps&quot; permissible prices for
&quot;interexchange access&quot; based on a complicated formula keyed to the prevailing
rate of inflation and forecasted productivity attainments.  But it also
requires local exchange carriers to &quot;share&quot; profits above a pre-determined
level with customers.  By focusing on the appropriate productivity factor and
eliminating the &quot;sharing formula,&quot;  the FCC could discard all the
paraphernalia associated with traditional rate-base or rate-of-return
regulation, such as depreciation regulation and cost allocation rules.
<p>
Sea Change in Approach.  In every telecommunications proceeding underway, the
FCC should ask if the relevant market is competitive.  If so, it should
refrain from regulating or consider how it can adapt regulation to promote
rather than hinder competition.  An illustration of the need for a dramatic
change in outlook is the FCC's proposal to impose mandatory resale on paging
operators.  That  market has numerous competitors and no serious observer
contends that it is not effectively competitive. <p>
This approach should also be taken as to the rulemakings required by the new
law.  Two examples include the rulemakings the FCC must undertake to promote
geographic averaged rates and universal service.  Imposing geographically
averaged rates is inconsistent with competition.   Long distance competition
could be distorted by companies limiting their activities to low cost
regions.  In that case national carriers might find it difficult to compete
in those areas.  Under the forbearance section, the FCC should find that
competitive concerns require any geographic averaging of rates to be limited
and transitional. Similarly, universal service subsidies must be reduced and
targeted to those who need them.  Market-based mechanisms can be fashioned to
phase  out unnecessary subsidies that could distort and impede the
development of competition.<p>

License Transfers and other changes.  The Commission reviews the assignment
and transfer of all broadcast stations.  Instead, it could adopt a
self-certification approach that would put the onus on the buyer who would
certify that all the relevant statutes and FCC regulations have been met.
 The FCC should where necessary clarify its regulations to ease the
certification process and use audits as the basis for determining compliance.
 Alternatively, the FCC could select a self regulating organization (SRO)
which could review all license transfers and assignments.  Self certification
of transfers and assignments would likely be supported by the industry as
evidenced by its endorsement by Broadcasting and Cable magazine.  
<p>
Why Reform Is Important<br>
We are all familiar with the rapid change in the computer industry.  In the
space of five years, IBM lost roughly $70 billion dollars of market
capitalization.  In the same period, many small hardware and software
companies grew exponentially, more than offsetting those mainframe losses.
 Who can seriously question the likelihood that if Apple, Intel, Compaq and
Microsoft had required FCC approval to get to the market, the personal
computer revolution would have been postponed.<p>
The case for dramatic reform is now more compelling than ever before.
 Growing global competition, merging markets and the revolution in digital
and related technologies make the unintended and untoward effects of
government regulation far more costly than in the past.  Heightened
competition has often undercut the rationale for regulation.  Moreover, the
increasing pace of change makes the costs of regulatory delay increasingly
unacceptable.<p>
Fundamental reform of the FCC would unleash innovative and entrepreneurial
forces and would build on the U.S.'s current but perishable lead in the
global digital derby.  Reform of the electromagnetic spectrum, alone, could
promote the development of competition in local telecommunications markets
and create a raft of new wireless digital services and devices.  America is
positioned to leave other countries in a cloud of silicon dust.  A regulatory
framework that slows innovation in this area, despite any plausible shortrun
efficiency gains it might achieve, will foreclose a tremendous opportunity
for the American people.<p>

<h2>En Banc Hearing on Spectrum Allocation</h2>
<b>Before the Federal Communications Commission</b><P>
Statement of <a href="/pff/people/afellow.html#Pitsch">Peter K. Pitsch</a>
<P><br>
<B>Summary</B>
<P>
The overarching goal in managing the electromagnetic spectrum
should be to maximize its value to the American people. As in
other areas of our economy, the best means of achieving efficient
use of this resource is to rely principally on market forces.
<P>
There are three fundamental problems with the current system.
They span the 60-year history of <a href="http://www.fcc.gov">the FCC</a> and continue to this
day. They are systemic. One, the FCC like other central planners
lacks the information necessary to make efficient decisions. Two,
the administrative process has been used by special interests
to delay competition and innovation. Three, the current system
has held fallow or underutilized a substantial portion of the
spectrum for government purposes.
<P>
The simple solution to the current spectrum gridlock is to give
existing and new spectrum users more operational and technical
flexibility to use their spectrum the way they see fit so long
as they do not interfere with their cochannel and adjacent channel
&quot;neighbors.&quot; Once a licensee is given the freedom to
use its spectrum for a broad range of uses, the licensee has a
strong economic incentive to consider the relative merits of alternative
uses. The more flexibility the licensee has, the more likely it
is that its use will be the highest and best use reflecting the
spectrum's true opportunity cost to society. 
<P>
In <a href="/pff/telecom_revolution.html">&quot;The Telecom Revolution, An American Opportunity,&quot;</a>
the Progress &amp; Freedom working group (of which I am a member)
proposed two fundamental spectrum reforms. First, unallocated
private sector spectrum and underutilized government spectrum
should be made available to private users. The spectrum should
be structured in highly flexible parcels with minimal government
constraints. These parcels should give the legal protection and
freedoms that attach to property, viz., technical and operational
freedom, protection from trespass or unlawful takings, and the
ability to assign, lease or sell. Where there are mutually exclusive
bids for these new parcels, winners should be selected by auctions.
<P>
The second way to achieve spectrum reform is to deregulate or
privatize existing spectrum users. As with the newly allocated
spectrum, the Congress should move to give existing users full
flexibility to use their spectrum subject to interference and
international treaty constraints. Licensees should be encouraged
to negotiate with their &quot;neighbors&quot; to reach mutually
beneficial agreements on possible new uses of their spectrum.

<P>
The time has come for the FCC to dramatically reform the spectrum
process. Spectrum gridlock is a primary obstacle to the full exploitation
of the computer revolution. Few things will promote wireless computer
applications and local telephone competition as much as driving
down the cost of spectrum by several orders of magnitude. A centrally-planned,
government-run allocation system probably never made sense. It
has cost Americans billions of dollars in foregone wealth and
prosperity, but the accelerating pace of technical change and
the increasing complexity of the spectrum allocation decisions
that have to be made make the case for dramatic reform more compelling
than ever before.
<P>
<B>Testimony</B>
<P>
It is an honor to have this opportunity to speak before the Federal
Communications Commission on one of the most important telecommunications
opportunities facing America--reforming our management of the
electromagnetic spectrum. I do not come recently to this issue.
I was in the thick of FCC deliberations on spectrum policy in
the 1980s, first as Chief of the FCC's Office of Plans &amp; Policy
for Chairman Mark Fowler and second as Chief of Staff to Chairman
Dennis Patrick. During those years I strongly espoused reforms
that would give licensees more technical and operational control
over how they use their spectrum and the use of auctions for initial
assignments where there are mutually exclusive applications. Since
then I have consulted for various telecom companies on spectrum
and other FCC-related issues.
<P>
Most recently, I and several other analysts from a wide range
of think tanks helped write The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation's
report on the FCC, &quot;The Telecom Revolution, An American Opportunity.&quot;
In it, we recommended privatizing spectrum management.
<P>
The overarching goal in managing the electromagnetic spectrum
should be to maximize its value to the American people. As in
the rest of our economy, the best means of achieving efficient
use of the spectrum is to rely principally on market forces. In
my brief remarks today, I would like to catalog various types
of failure systemic to the current centrally-planned, government-run
spectrum regime, then identify the two ways in which spectrum
reform can be achieved, and lastly spend a few moments discussing
the tremendous importance of spectrum reform to America's economic
and competitive prospects.
<P>
There are three fundamental problems with the current system.
They span the 60-year history of the FCC and continue to this
day. They are systemic. One, the FCC like other central planners
lacks the information necessary to make efficient decisions. Two,
the administrative process has been used by special interests
to delay competition and innovation. Three, the current system
has held fallow or underutilized a substantial portion of the
spectrum for government purposes.
<P>
First, determining efficient use is a complex task requiring vast
amounts of continually updated information that is hopelessly
beyond the abilities of an administrative process. Markets, of
course, &quot;parallel-process&quot; information gathered by millions
of businesses and consumers to continually provide price signals
on the relative usefulness of the myriad competing demands and
uses of spectrum. In the case of spectrum, the information required
to make the necessary tradeoffs is greater than in most other
areas of the economy, because the pace of technological development
has created a raft of new uses for &quot;wireless&quot; communications
and new ways in which spectrum can be efficiently deployed. The
comparative advantage of markets is greater in such dynamic situations.
<P>
As a result, the FCC has consistently made simplistic and overly
rigid decisions that misallocated spectrum, created inefficient
industry structures, and locked in outdated technical standards.
For example, in the 1950s the FCC dramatically underallocated
spectrum to VHF television reducing the availability of television
channels and impeding the development of a third, fourth and fifth
national television network. In the 1970s it long delayed and
then underallocated spectrum to cellular mobile telephony, creating
only two cellular companies. This delay alone cost America $85
billion dollars. Time and again it imposed a nationwide grid that
did not account for local differences--underallocating forestry
spectrum in Idaho and overallocating it in New York City and vice
versa for taxicab spectrum. Finally, the FCC locked in an analog
technical standard for cellular telephony that was 20 years old
and out of date by the time the FCC got around to assigning cellular
licenses.
<P>
The second systemic failure of the current spectrum regime is
its susceptibility to capture by special interests opposed to
innovation and competition. In the face of political pressure,
the FCC has again and again delayed the allocation of spectrum
to innovative new services. Examples include Direct Broadcast
Television, so called &quot;wireless cable&quot;, low power TV,
VHF drop ins, and new FM channels. Few companies and no trade
association can resist the temptation to use the current regulatory
scheme to disadvantage new competition or innovation. H.L. Mencken's
quip applies with full force, &quot;It may be a sin to think evil
of others, but it is seldom a mistake.&quot; The sad reality is
that in this &quot;regulatory game&quot;, the established concentrated
economic interests typically triumph over the amorphous and diffuse
interests of consumers.
<P>
The FCC's &quot;public interest&quot; regulation of spectrum has
been used as a weapon against consumers. Regulated companies frequently
have embraced special public interest obligations in exchange
for protection from competitors and innovation. This &quot;taxation
by regulation&quot; by unelected regulators, followed by the inevitable
<B>quid pro quo</B>, has been extremely costly to consumers. Any
such deals should be made explicitly and only by Congress.
<P>
The third systemic failure of the current system of spectrum management
is the underutilization of spectrum by the government sector.
While there is some debate on how much spectrum is effectively
denied to the private sector, there can be little doubt that it
is in absolute terms a huge amount. Many governmental uses of
spectrum are vital; others are not. All of these uses should be
justified economically. Today government users of spectrum have
access to spectrum at far less cost than that available to non
government users. Recall that in the recent PCS auctions the winners
paid over $7 billion for 60 MHz of PCS spectrum. Moreover, because
government users do not operate under a profit incentive and often
have difficulty funding the use of new spectrum efficient technology,
they are probably far less efficient than private users.
<P>
The simple solution to the current spectrum gridlock is to give
existing and new spectrum users more operational and technical
flexibility to use their spectrum the way they see fit so long
as they do not interfere with their cochannel and adjacent channel
&quot;neighbors.&quot; The logic of this reform is easily illustrated.
Typically, a licensee has two choices: (1) use its spectrum for
a narrow purpose with the specific technology that the FCC has
designated or (2) give it back to the FCC. Given this choice,
the current spectrum use will be economic to the licensee as long
as it has any positive value. In economic terms the &quot;opportunity
cost&quot; of the spectrum to the licensee is zero. The cost to
society, of course, is the most valuable alternative use that
is foregone. Importantly, technological developments and the elimination
of other regulatory barriers has been dramatically increasing
the value of these alternative uses.
<P>
Once a licensee is given the freedom to use its spectrum for a
broad range of uses, however, the licensee has a strong economic
incentive to consider the relative merits of alternative uses.
The more flexibility the licensee has, the more likely it is that
its use will be the highest and best use reflecting the spectrum's
true opportunity cost to society.
<P>
In &quot;The Telecom Revolution, An American Opportunity,&quot;
the Progress &amp; Freedom working group proposed a four-part
plan to reform spectrum management. For sake of brevity, this
plan can be reduced to two mechanisms. First, the FCC should make
unallocated private sector spectrum and underutilized government
spectrum available to private users. The spectrum should be structured
in highly flexible parcels with minimal government constraints.
These parcels should give the legal protection and freedoms that
attach to property, viz., technical and operational freedom, protection
from trespass or unlawful takings, and the ability to assign,
lease or sell. Of course, these new users should be subject to
antitrust and other laws that apply to businesses generally. Where
there are mutually exclusive bids for these new parcels, winners
should be selected by auctions. The use of simultaneous multiple
round auctions should allow users to aggregate spectrum (both
in bandwidth and geographically) to reduce the costs of introducing
equipment, resolving interference disputes, and marketing a new
service.
<P>
A few words about auctions are in order. They are the most efficient
means of assigning licenses where there are mutually exclusive
applicants for three reasons. First, they make assignments more
quickly than administrative hearings and lotteries. A three-year
delay imposed by comparative hearings or lotteries can easily
wipe out a full one-fourth of the present value of the license.
Second, they assign the spectrum to those who are most likely
to put it to its highest valued use. Third, they make these assignments
at less cost to society. Instead of using scarce resources in
expensive lotteries and comparative hearings, applicants compete
by adding zeros to the size of the transfer payment they are willing
to make to the government.
<P>
Note that the primary value of auctions is not that they raise
money for the government. Care should be taken that auctions do
not become an obstacle to the principal goal of reducing spectrum
scarcity. Spectrum should be released as rapidly and efficiently
as possible, even if that reduces the government's auction proceeds,
because the goal is to free up spectrum for the benefit of the
American economy. Indeed, if the FCC is doing its job right auction
prices for comparable parcels of spectrum should fall over time.
<P>
The second way to achieve spectrum reform is to deregulate or
privatize existing spectrum users. As with the newly allocated
spectrum, the FCC should move to give existing users full flexibility
to use their spectrum subject to interference and international
treaty constraints. Licensees should be encouraged to negotiate
with their &quot;neighbors&quot; to reach mutually beneficial
agreements on possible new uses of their spectrum. This approach
creates a private incentive to &quot;reallocate&quot; spectrum
and take on the vested interests that can be counted to oppose
new competition and innovation. (Evan Kwerel and John Williams
of the FCC have illustrated one way in which this approach could
be used in the UHF spectrum.) Likewise, the government agencies
should be encouraged to sell or sublease their spectrum to the
private sector.
<P>
Those who see privatizing existing spectrum as a government &quot;giveaway&quot;
miss the point. The existing users have for the most part purchased
their spectrum in the resale market. It is not fair, efficient
or politically feasible to require them to pay for their spectrum
again. Furthermore, top down grants of flexible spectrum will
be difficult because the existing users will collectively oppose
the release of hundreds of MHz in flexible allocations. Privatizing
existing spectrum will create a competition among existing licensees
to move &quot;beach front&quot; spectrum from its current &quot;land
dump&quot; uses. In this parlance, the current &quot;beach property
owners&quot; may not appreciate these efforts, but they will not
be able to stop them. Indeed, they might well choose to join them.
In the end, America's &quot;beach-consuming public&quot; will
benefit.
<P>
It should be noted that these approaches do not require all or
nothing. You can do them in degree. In fact the Commission, under
Chairmen Fowler, Patrick, Sikes and Hundt, has increasingly utilized
the concepts of flexibility and private negotiation. Examples
include giving cellular licensees flexibility, allowing ITFS licensees
to lease spectrum to wireless cable operators, allowing FM radio
stations to use their subcarriers for paging and other uses, allowing
PCS licensees to buy out microwave licensees in their license
areas, opening the eligibility of SMRS licensees, and consolidating
land mobile pools. Working within the limits of the administrative
process and the current law has been a difficult task and they
and their fellow commissioners and many key staffers deserve credit
for what they have done.
<P>
The time has come, however, for the FCC to dramatically speed
up this process. A centrally-planned, government-run allocation
system probably never made sense. It has cost Americans billions
of dollars in foregone wealth and prosperity, but the accelerating
pace of technical change and the increasing complexity of the
spectrum allocation decisions that have to be made make the case
for dramatic reform more compelling than ever before.
<P>
We are all familiar with the rapid change in the computer industry.
In the space of five years, <a href="http://www.ibm.com">IBM</a> lost roughly $70 billion dollars
of market capitalization. In the same period, many small hardware
and software companies grew exponentially, more than offsetting
those mainframe losses. Who can seriously question the likelihood
that if <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a>, <a href="http://www.intel.com">Intel</a>, <a href="http://www.compaq.com">Compaq</a> and <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft</a> had required FCC spectrum
to get to the market, the personal computer revolution would have
been postponed.
<P>
In the same way, spectrum gridlock is a primary obstacle to the
full exploitation of the computer revolution. Few things will
promote wireless computer applications and local telephone competition
as much as driving down the cost of spectrum by several orders
of magnitude. Fundamental spectrum reform would build on the U.S.'s
current but perishable lead in the global digital derby. America
is positioned to leave other countries in a cloud of silicon dust.
A regulatory framework that slows innovation in this area, despite
any plausible shortrun efficiency gains it might achieve, will
foreclose a tremendous opportunity for the American people.

<h2>On the Road to Digital Freedom</h2>
<P>

The Telecommunications Act of  1996 (TCA) represents the most
sweeping reform of telecommunications law in more than 60 years.
 In principle, the new legislation will enable local telephone
companies, long distance companies, cable TV companies, direct
broadcast satellite providers, over-the-air broadcasters, cellular
companies and a host of others to compete against one another
to provide all sorts of communications and information services
in the converging market for digital information and information
technology.  The potential benefits for consumers and for America's
position in the world are beyond calculation.
<P>
The key word in the previous sentence, however, is <I>potential</I>.
 As some commentators have noted, TCA is not, in and of itself,
a deregulatory bill.  Indeed, it mandates over 80 new rulemakings
by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), and delegates
significant authority to state regulators.  If the FCC and the
states use their authority to reduce regulation and encourage
competition, TCA can lead to an efficient, deregulated regime
for the new digital information marketplace and put America on
the road to digital freedom.
<P>
But TCA does not mandate such a result.  In most cases, it gives
the FCC and the states authority to deregulate, but it does not
require that they do so.  For example:
<UL>
<LI>Regulators will oversee the opening of local telephone markets
to competition.  Along the way they will have to address many
difficult technical and economic issues including interconnection,
unbundling, number portability, resale, dialing parity and right-of-way
access.  The nature and pace of the transition is left largely
to regulatory discretion.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Regulators will also implement very broad provisions designed
to change dramatically the current system of &quot;universal service&quot;
subsidies, aiming to target them more to low income households,
collect them in a competitively-neutral fashion and otherwise
reduce them where possible.  
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The Telecommunications Act of 1996 provides that the FCC &quot;shall
forbear&quot; from regulating where public interest criteria are
met.  How the FCC uses its discretion in implementing this provision
will have a dramatic impact on the pace of deregulation.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The final days of legislative debate spotlighted the importance
of issues associated with the electromagnetic spectrum.  In coming
months, both the FCC and Congress will consider how current spectrum
management practices should be reformed.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
The smoothness and even success of the transition to a competitive
digital marketplace will depend upon how well these issues are
handled.  The consequences for America's future are enormous:
 
<UL>
<LI>Digital information products and services are the most rapidly
growing segment of the world economy, expected to account for
$1 trillion or more in sales by the year 2000.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Technological advances in these areas are the driving force
behind a global transition from an industrial age economy to an
information age economy, literally transforming every aspect of
the world economy, and society itself.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The social consequences of the transition are profound, and
implementation of TCA will have profound consequences for how
digital technologies are made available to all segments of the
population.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>America's leadership in the world, and ultimately its national
security, are dependent on continuing its leadership role in information
technology. 
</UL>

<P>

<P>
<h3>The Working Group</h3>

<P>
Early last year House Telecom Subcommittee Chairman Jack Fields
asked the Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation for its recommendations
on reforming the Federal Communications Commission.  PFF assembled
a &quot;working group&quot; of top-flight telecom experts and
scholars, many of whom had been senior staffers at the FCC for
several years.  The working group includes:
<UL>
<LI>Dr. Robert Crandall, Brookings Institution;
<LI>Dr. Jeffrey Eisenach, Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation;
<LI>James Gattuso, Esq., Citizens For A Sound Economy;
<LI>Dr. Thomas Hazlett, University of California, Davis;
<LI>Peter W. Huber, Manhattan Institute;
<LI>Dr. George A. Keyworth, Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation;
<LI>Dr. Thomas Lenard, Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation;
<LI>William C. Myers, Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation;
<LI>Peter Pitsch, Esq., Hudson Institute;
<LI>Kenneth Robinson, Esq.;
<LI>Gregory Sidak, Esq., American Enterprise Institute; and
<LI>Adam Thierer, Heritage Foundation.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
Last May, the working group produced  a replacement model for
the FCC entitled <I>The Telecom Revolution, An American Opportunity</I>.
 This report outlined an approach for eliminating much of the
current regulatory apparatus and replacing the FCC with a smaller,
leaner oversight agency designed to promote competition.   The
working group report played an important role in educating public
policy leaders and members of the public about the nature of the
transition to a digital environment, and served as the focus of
PFF testimony before both Congress and the FCC; members of the
working group met with leaders in both Houses of Congress on numerous
occasions to brief them on their findings.
<P>
In 1996, Congress has again turned to the working group, with
the chairs of the major oversight committees in both Houses requesting
specific assistance from PFF with respect to issues ranging from
spectrum management, to forebearance, to the structure of the
FCC itself.  FCC Chairman Reed Hundt has also sought PFF's input
and advice.
<P>
<h3>The Project and its Activities</h3>

<P>
PFF's May 1995 report concluded that the pace of technological
change has fundamentally changed the political economy of regulation.
 Innovation has made effective competition possible throughout
the telecom market.  It has also dramatically increased the cost
of regulatory delays and impediments.  The FCC needed to be replaced
by a new, smaller, more focused agency.  
<P>
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 has provided the means and
added impetus for achieving this goal.  The new legislation requires
state and federal regulators to assure that a competitive 14-point
checklist of conditions are met in local exchange markets, before
allowing the regional Bell operating companies to enter the in-region
long distance and equipment manufacturing markets.  The implementation
of the interconnection, network unbundling, and related pricing
issues will be major battlegrounds.  This process is important
to the efficient development of local telecommunications competition
and the expeditious development of additional competition in long
distance and equipment markets.  
<P>
Fashioning universal service reforms will present a stiff political
challenge.  Many interests will press for the expansion of the
definition of universal service.  If these subsidies are not reduced
and targeted, a competitively-neutral system that does not impede
new technology will be difficult to achieve.  The legislation
sets forward specific universal service principles to be observed,
but also gives the FCC considerable latitude to reform the system.
 A convincing record and strategy will be needed to carry out
true reform. 
<P>
To free up needed administrative resources and eliminate counterproductive
regulation, the FCC will need to forbear from regulating in many
areas.  Suitable areas for deregulation will need to be identified
and justified.  At the same time, the FCC will be wrestling with
a raft of other issues ranging from antenna preemption to video
services provided by telephone companies. 
<P>
The legislation has also created an enormous opportunity for the
FCC to spur local telephone competition and the development of
 new wireless services by making more spectrum available through
market mechanisms.  Practical ways of dealing with interference
and other objections to &quot;dezoning&quot; the spectrum will
need to be developed.  Alternative mechanisms of freeing up spectrum,
such as variants of the PCS overlay approach and a more &quot;bottom-up&quot;
approach used in the case of Nextel, will need to be closely examined
and appraised.
<P>
In short, much more detailed work will be needed to effect a smooth
transition to a truly competitive digital information marketplace.
 The updated FCC replacement project will provide a detailed plan
of action building on the new legislation, focusing both on the
implementation of TCA and the need for additional legislation
to further speed the transition.  Given TCA's reliance on devolution
to the states, a telecommunications model for state law and regulation
will also be developed.  Specifically, <I>On The Road to Digital
Freedom</I> will provide important research in six main areas:
<UL>
<LI>The FCC role in creating competitive market conditions in
local telecommunications markets;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The FCC role in assuring universal service goals are met;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Spectrum management reforms that could be undertaken by the
FCC or legislated by Congress;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Specific areas in which the FCC should forbear from regulating;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Specific areas of FCC regulation that Congress should eliminate
or transfer to other agencies; and,
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The role and specific direction the states should take in
speeding the transition to a competitive digital marketplace.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
The project will produce three major written products and three
related events.
<P>
A draft update of the replacement model for the FCC will be produced
by mid-April, 1996.  This first effort will focus on spectrum
and forbearance issues and be timed to inform expected hearings
in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives on spectrum and
FCC restructuring issues.  It will provide the basis for a PFF
strategic summit in mid-April on the implications of the Telecommunications
Act of 1996.  
<P>
The final draft of the FCC replacement report will be completed
by July 1996, prior to Congress' August recess and the Foundation's
August Aspen Summit, at which the report will be presented and
debated.  
<P>
Finally, an expanded stand-alone report on state regulatory issues
will be completed by November 1996 and released in time to inform
state legislative deliberations in 1997.  State telecommunications
licensing and regulation recommendations will be presented to
state legislative leaders at a winter workshop, perhaps hosted
in conjunction with the American Legislative Exchange Council.
<P>
In addition to these reports and events, the Foundation will maintain
a site on the Internet, at which key issues will be presented
and debated; will arrange expert testimony before appropriate
state and Congressional legislative committees, upon request;
issue Progress on Point alerts, as appropriate; and otherwise
inform the national debate on telecommunications and information
technology policy.
<P>
The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation will provide overall direction
for the project and will have ultimate responsibility for the
final product.  From PFF, the project team will include Dr. George
A. Keyworth, II, Chairman; Dr. Jeffrey Eisenach, President; William
Myers, Vice President for Policy; and Dr. Thomas Lenard, Senior
Fellow and Director of Regulatory Studies.  Peter Pitsch, Esq.,
now an adjunct fellow at PFF, will direct the project.  Participation
of other working group members is expected to provide input on
all important aspects of the project.

<h2>Introduction & Summary</h2>

<P>        America is in the midst of an historic period of  dynamic change and
opportunity driven by a transformation of  technology.  In 1995, one half of
all capital investment in America, broadly defined, will be in computers and
telecommunications equipment. The telecommunications industry already
constitutes one seventh of our economy and is growing.  By the early 21st
century, the global information industry is expected to be a $3 trillion
market.  Yet the government statutory and regulatory system now in place was
erected in the 1930s during the New Deal and embodies the limits and
technological realities of a long-vanished era.

<P>        To seize the opportunities of the knowledge age, a new, modern and efficient
governmental role with respect to telecommunications is needed.  Government
can, and indeed should, perform certain tasks.  This report is an effort to
identify and focus on the essential governmental functions needed for America
to enter the new century -- and to cleanse the detritus of the past.  Many
current governmental institutions and regulations are relics of past
practices and  seek to perform tasks better performed by competitive markets.
 The report has a simple goal: to provide for a modern and effective
government to complement market forces to speed the development of  new
products and services for Americans.

<P>        The new, smaller government role (hereafter the <I>Replacement Model</I>) is
based on a functional analysis of what a government should be for a digital
era of the 1990s and beyond.  A functional analysis reveals certain
overarching principles which are applied by the Replacement Model.
 Conceptually, a functional analysis supports a government role for ensuring
parity of  opportunity  across media such as wireline, cellular, broadcast,
DBS and video dialtone.  The success of any one company or even industry
should reflect their inherent attributes rather than their relative
regulatory handicaps.  With respect to mission, the Replacement Model will
provide for a new Office of Communications (the "OC") to be located within an
existing Executive Branch agency.  

<P>        The OC will concentrate on the following tasks: (1) overseeing the
implementation of a transition from the current practice of universal service
based on hidden and elaborate cross-subsidies to a smaller, more efficient
and targeted needs -- based system; (2) overseeing the mass privatization of
 spectrum to the American people through a sequenced, phased-in  auction
process; (3) coordinating a non-interference standard to govern the private
sector's use of spectrum; and (4) coordinating U.S. international commitments
and opportunities for telecommunications. Supporting the new, more focused
 governmental role will be an emphasis on traditional antitrust enforcement
utilizing existing expertise and personnel located within the U.S. Department
of Justice. 

<P>        The Replacement Model offers a detailed and  specific action plan for the
transition to a the new, modern government.  Existing statutes, rules and
regulations are either eliminated immediately, subject to a three year sunset
provision, or retained and re-assigned to the Replacement Model's Office of
Communications.  At the end of the sunset period, those rules and regulations
deemed necessary by the OC to promote economic welfare through competition
will be retained only by affirmative action of Congress.

<P>        Part One of this report establishes the case for replacing and modernizing
the existing regulatory regime. The focus is on the systemic influence of
 regulations and statutes which authorize the <A HREF="http://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications
Commission</A> ("FCC") and have inflicted staggering costs upon American
consumers and the economy.  The report recognizes that other restrictions
arising from federal/state mechanisms such as the Modified Final Judgment
("MFJ")  settlement also have had an impact on competition.  

<P>        The systemic problem, however, remains that the statutes, rules and
regulations underlying the FCC have denied through intrusive regulation the
U.S. economy tens of billions of dollars in annual growth. Current public
servants may be dedicated and hard working.  It is the system itself which in
some measure mandates that the FCC engage in certain practices and procedures
which block new products and services such as cable TV, microwave, cellular,
voice mail, video dialtone and new personal communications services. For
decades these technologies have been denied Americans while the FCC struggled
to decide what to allow to the consumer.  Price competition has been stymied
and business costs ultimately borne by the American public have been
needlessly inflated by a plethora of entry, ownership and contractual
regulations of telephone and media markets. Part One details the history of
this structural obstruction of technology and competition.

<P>        Resolving the economic imbalances imposed by universal service is a key
ingredient to any meaningful reform proposal.  Basic dialtone telephone
service for those truly in need is an essential element to a sustainable
modernization of government's role.  Part Two offers two approaches to
providing basic service for those truly in need.  The approaches make the
actual price of phone service open and clear to the American people.
 Currently, a hidden tax is imposed on all through various subsidies.  Urban
users subsidize rural users. Business and long-distance rates subsidize
residential rates. Much of the money is paid to companies, not consumers.
 Many of the well-to-do get subsidized.  The current system imposes burdens
on those allegedly it seeks to help -- those financially less well off.  An
urban, single parent family on government assistance programs today actually
subsidizes the phone bills of  rural users -- even if the rural user calls
from a ski chalet or vacation home  straight out of  Lifestyles of the Rich
and Famous.

<P>         Moreover, no one knows what the subsidies cost despite the billions of
dollars in the system because the lack of accountability destroys incentives
to economize.  Like a Soviet-era good under Gosplan, no one really pays the
true cost of the phone services they use.  The replacement model puts a halt
to this muddle.  

<P>        The model supports the claimed purpose of cross-subsidization, promotion of
so-called "universal service," but in ways that are more accountable,
explicit and efficient.  Both plans recognize a national  interest in keeping
basic phone service affordable to all Americans.  The first model has three
facets.  First, the federal program to keep residential telephone rates
affordable in high cost areas would be limited to that amount needed on a
going forward basis to provide wireline service to those areas.  Second, the
model embraces use of  a specific, targeted means test to provide assistance
to those truly in need.  Third, the responsibility for the remainder of the
universal service subsidies paid by interstate long distance callers would
devolve to the state level subject to broad federal guidelines.  Restoration
of market prices and efficient pricing will foster real competition and
result in substantially lower prices.

<P>        The second approach proposes that the responsibility for maintaining
universal service be transferred to the states.   Those local exchange costs
that are now allocated to the interstate jurisdiction are returned to the
respective states.  Each state could recover those costs as deemed fit,
subject to federal guidelines.  Under this model, federal law would  pre-empt
entry restrictions and prohibit discriminatory treatment of interstate users
for comparable services. 

<P>        Both approaches are subject to strict federal guidelines forbidding price
discrimination and requiring interconnection for all competitors.  Moreover,
the Replacement Model continues the federal pre-emption of state regulation
of wireless services.

<P>        In Part Three, the Replacement Model promotes American competitiveness
through a modern approach to use of  the spectrum. Spectrum is transferred to
private hands in a sequenced,  phased-in approach.  In Phase One, those with
current licenses in spectrum are granted title to the spectrum currently
used.  These owners of spectrum , the vast majority of whom have already
purchased their stations, will be free to use, transfer and develop spectrum
as they deem necessary.   Property rights in spectrum will be enforced
through traditional legal protections afforded all property owners in the
courts. Under this approach, industry would also have recourse to the OC for
interference issues and use of laboratories for testing and evaluation of new
equipment and technologies.

<P>        In Phase Two, applications pending before the FCC as of May 1, 1995,  would
be granted title to the spectrum on an expedited basis.  In addition, the OC
will on an expedited basis, begin to roll-out non-allocated spectrum for the
presumptive use by private sector entities seeking its use.  Competing bids for the
spectrum will be subject to expedited auction.  This bottom-up, demand-driven
process will allow market forces to determine spectrum use and jump start
competition and technological innovation.  

<P>        In Phase Three, the government will begin the process of turning over its
spectrum to the private sector by beginning an expedited survey of available
spectrum bands, establishing standardized parcels for entrants to claim.  The
government currently presides over massive amounts of under-utilized spectrum
far in excess of its needs for possible use by the <A HREF="http://www.dtic.dla.mil/defenselink/index.html">Department of Defense</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</A>, etc. 

<P>        In Phase Four, the government will  permit claimants to claim title to
available spectrum as identified in the spectrum survey. In the event that
there are multiple claimants for a particular parcel of spectrum, an auction
will be held.  Each department making the spectrum available that is subject
to an auction will retain a portion of auction proceeds for modernization to
more efficient digital equipment, re-location expenses and for current
operations.  Remaining auction proceeds can be dedicated to deficit
reduction.

<P>        The premise again is that spectrum use will be dictated by the American
people, not the government.  The Replacement Model envisions a governmental
role for coordinating "spectrum contours," "overlay rights" and "band
management rights" but mandates that these rights be defined quickly and made
available for private investors willing to risk capital in developing new
wireless services.  The key is to sell title in property, not mere licenses.
 Those who claim unchallenged use of identified parcels or bid and win title
to spectrum are free to develop and/or re-sell the spectrum as with any other
private property right subject to antitrust review and the geographic and
interference boundaries of property assignments.  The primary goal of these
spectrum reforms is the rapid and efficient creation of a spectrum market and
to provide an economic stimulus in job creation.  Recent announcements by the
government confirmed that auctioning spectrum can also have a supplemental
benefit of raising billions in revenue for deficit reduction.

<P>        Finally, Part Four sets out a detailed and specific plan for implementing
the Replacement Model's recommendations.   It re-assigns and re-organizes the
functions now performed by the FCC.  The goal is to focus on the critical
tasks for today and the future.  Government unquestionably should fulfill
some functions and services for the benefit of all Americans.  Others should
be eliminated immediately. A third residual category of FCC rules and
regulations would be sunsetted in three years.

<P>         The Replacement Model updates government to account for the differences
between the analog past and the technologies now emerging through market
forces.  For sixty years, the government substituted administrative,
bureaucratic decision-making for the free market.  Two old, major assumptions
-- (1) the existence of a "natural monopoly" in telecommunications; and (2)
the assumption that technology would remain essentially static or unchanging
-- are untenable for the 21st century.  The model makes a clear break with
the past, embracing competition with antitrust enforcement and by
transferring authority to the states in those instances when monopoly
regulation remains temporarily necessary. The new role for government is
leaner, more cost effective and serves the American people.   This, then,  is
a call to action to meet the challenges of the telecommunications revolution
-- an American opportunity.

<h2>Broadcast Spectrum: Putting Principles First</h2>
by The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation's <a href="#board">FCC Working Group</a>
<P>
For the last several months, House and Senate conferees have worked
diligently to iron out differences between the telecommunications
bills passed by their respective bodies.  They have reached apparent
closure on a compromise that would begin the process of creating
a new telecom &quot;playing field&quot; based on policies of competition,
open entry and market forces.
<P>Recently, disagreements have arisen
on one of the bill's major provisions, which addresses the allocation
of a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum for use by broadcasters.
 These disagreements threaten to delay or even derail final action
on a bill which has the potential to generate tremendous benefits
for consumers.
<P>
As background, the FCC is proposing to allocate
6 MHz licenses in today's UHF TV band  for the development of
so-called &quot;Advanced Television&quot; (ATV)(1), a new digital
technology that has indeed shown great promise.  Enormous controversy
exists over how these licenses should be assigned.  The current
legislation would require the FCC to limit eligibility for these
licenses to existing broadcasters who would, at some unspecified
time in the future, return their current spectrum to the government
following a transition to the new digital system(2).  Others,
most notably Senator Dole, contend that the licenses should be
assigned on the basis of competitive bidding or auctions among
all comers, a move the FCC believes could generate $10 to $70
billion in revenues. 
<P>
What's gotten lost in this debate is principle,
and the principle is property.  The paramount goal of spectrum
reform should be to channel existing broadcast spectrum -- and
new, so-called ATV spectrum - to its highest and best use.  Auctions
are one of several necessary reforms.  Far more important is the
need to give spectrum users the marketplace freedom and incentives
to deploy spectrum and new digital technologies efficiently. 
Giving existing and new spectrum users more flexibility to use
their spectrum as they see fit (as long as they do not interfere
with their spectrum &quot;neighbors&quot;) will create strong
economic incentives for spectrum users to weigh the relative merits
of possible uses.  Such flexibility and incentives are best achieved
through property rights. 
<P>
Government ownership and micromanagement
of the broadcast spectrum dates to Herbert Hoover's decision in
1927 to expropriate the spectrum on behalf of the Federal government.
 Since that time, the government has meted out  limited duration
&quot;licenses&quot; allowing use of the spectrum only under the
tightest of government controls.  The centrally-planned FCC system
typified by the current approach to ATV lacks the market flexibility,
incentives and information necessary to direct spectrum to its
highest and best use.  Time and again,  the FCC has made overly
rigid spectrum allocations and impeded new technologies.  Indeed,
the administrative process has been used as a weapon against consumers
by existing competitors to disadvantage new entrants and innovative
technologies.
<P>
The solution to the current broadcast spectrum conundrum
is to recognize the error of Herbert Hoover's ways -- or at least
their obsolescence -- and return to a property rights regime for
the broadcast spectrum.
<P>
Specifically, broadcasters' rights to their
current spectrum should be recognized as property, pure and simple.
 They should be given, in effect, fee simple title to the spectrum
they now hold and be allowed to use it for any technology or service
customers want; or, if they prefer, to sell it to new owners.
<P>
As
for the new spectrum, it too should be relieved from government
control and returned to the private sector.  Auctions -- properly
constructed and without the myriad of special interest preferences
that have characterized previous auctions -- should be held as
soon as possible.  Winning bidders should also receive fee simple
title to their property, without restrictions on use.
<P>
Is such a
proposal politically viable?  Only the politicians can decide.
 But it would accomplish three important objectives.
<P>
Broadcasters
would be given something they do not now have -- an asset they
could use, borrow against or sell.  They would be able to use
their current spectrum for new technologies in entrepreneurial
ways currently prohibited by the FCC's licensing restrictions.
 And, if they decided they really do need the new spectrum to
make the transition to some new form of digital television, they
could borrow against the value of their current spectrum to capitalize
their participation in the auctions.
<P>
Deficit hawks would also get
their wish -- the near-term auction of the new spectrum.  And,
since the auction would now offer fee simple title, rather than
the government-limited licenses envisioned by the FCC, there is
every reason to believe it would generate even more money than
currently estimated.
<P>
Finally, and most important, the American
people would get back a small piece of what Herbert Hoover took
away in 1927, and take an important first step toward restoring
ownership of the entire electromagnetic spectrum to America's
entrepreneurial, innovative private sector, where it can contribute
to the prosperity potential of the information revolution.   Such
a step is essential to maintaining America's advantage in the
worldwide digital marketplace -- the fastest growing segment of
the global economy.<P><br>

<li> The transition would involve not only the construction of digital broadcasting facilities but also the purchase by consumers of digital receivers (new TV sets, or converters for their current sets).  Such a transition could easily take a decade or more during which broadcasters would retain licenses to their current spectrum, so long as they continue broadcasting analog television signals.

 There are four key issues pending with telecommunications conferees:
<ol>
<li><a href="#net">Internet Regulation</a>
<li><a href="#puhca">PUHCA</a>
<li><a href="#reg">Price Regulation</a>
<li><a href="#comp">Long Distance Competition</a></ol>
<P>

<P><a name="net"></a>
<center><B>INTERNET REGULATION</B>
<P></center>
Earlier this year, the House voted 420 to 4 in support of the
&quot;Cox-Wyden-White&quot; approach to Internet regulation and
&quot;cyberporn.&quot; This approach established no new criminal
penalties for pornography on the Net; provided immunity for on-line
service providers who enable users to block or screen access to
objectionable material; and, prohibited the FCC from regulating
the Net.  The Senate approved the more intrusive &quot;Exon&quot;
approach, which Speaker Gingrich opposed.
<P>
<i>This morning, House conferees met to decide what approach to
Internet regulation they would advance in Conference</i>.  They
adopted the White approach, which maintains most Cox-Wyden provisions
but also includes new criminal penalties for transmission of pornographic
material on the Net.  In adopting the White approach, however,
they changed the standard for application of these penalties from
the limited Constitutional standard of &quot;material harmful
to minors&quot; to &quot;indecency&quot; -- a killer amendment
in the eyes of the broad Internet, on-line provider and freedom
coalition (e.g., Americans for Tax Reform; Citizens for a Sound
Economy, Heritage Foundation).  The vote among House members was
17-16, with Republicans Goodlatte, Gallegly, Hoke, Moorhead, Frisa,
Barton, Hyde, Schaefer, Buyer, Flanigan, Barr, Paxon and Stearns
voting for the &quot;indecency&quot; approach.  The Christian
Coalition was strongly supportive of this change, with the freedom
coalition strongly opposed.  Democrats who supported the &quot;indecency&quot;
standard included Conyers, Schroeder, Gordon and Jackson-Lee.
<P>
<i>If this provision cannot be changed back to the original White
approach, many of those who supported the White approach will
work to kill the bill</i>.
<P><a name="puhca"></a>
<center><B>PUHCA</B>
<P></center>
The Senate telecommunications bill would allow the 14 registered
utility holding companies under the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935 (PUHCA) to enter telecommunications and related businesses
on the same basis as other companies (utility and non-utility).
 <i>Earlier this year, Speaker Gingrich called for such flexibility</i>
(see attached news release).  
<P>
The House bill has no provision comparable to the Senate language.
 In staff conference negotiations so far, the House has refused
to accept the Senate PUHCA language based on the assertion, advanced
most often by Congressmen Dingell and Markey, that it has insufficient
consumer protections for captive utility ratepayers.  (In reality,
the Senate bill contains extensive consumer protections aimed
at ensuring that captive ratepayers do not subsidize telecommunications
activities.)
<P>
<i>Senate staff have now offered additional consumer protections
in an attempt to break the impasse; no response has yet come from
the House</i>.
<P><a name="reg"></a>
<center><B>PRICE REGULATION</B>
<P></center>
Staff of House and Senate conferees have agreed to strike language
contained in both versions of the legislation requiring the FCC
and state public service commissions to replace old-style, cost-plus
rate-of-return regulation with price regulation.  This requirement
was included on the grounds that price regulation would not only
streamline Federal and state telecommunications regulation, but
would also reduce any financial incentives that the local telephone
companies might have to cross subsidize competitive services with
revenues earned from non-competitive offerings.
<P>
Price regulation requirements were included largely through the
efforts of Senator Lott and Congressman Tauzin.  <i>Staff apparently
decided to strike the provisions from the conference report in
deference to pressure from the White House and some state regulatory
commissions who view the requirement as an encroachment on their
jurisdiction</i>.
<P>
The move from rate of return regulation to price regulation was
a key feature of both bills, supported especially by Sen. Pressler
and Cong. Fields, and <i>its elimination from the final bill would
make it significantly less pro-competitive</i>.
<P><a name="comp"></a>
<center><B>LONG DISTANCE COMPETITION</B>
<P></center>
During the telecom debate in September, the House expressly rejected
provisions that would have delayed Bell company entry into the
long distance market until they were able to demonstrate that
local phone markets were competitive (i.e., a facilities based
test).  The House rejected this proposal out of concern it would
create a disincentive for long distance carriers to enter local
phone markets with the Bells, thereby delaying Bell entry into
the long distance market.
<P>
<i>Though the Senate staff apparently has agreed to the provisions
in the House bill, the long distance carriers have persuaded Chairman
Bliley and Rep. Fields to reconsider the type of facilities-based
local competition test that the House earlier rejected</i>. Neither
the House conferees nor the conference committee as a whole have
voted on this issue.

<i> &quot;Well, I think in the information age, too much information
and too much sort-of-quasi-information -- I mean, you guys have
to compete with near-news, too -- It's like, you know, like when
we were kids, we'd drink near-beer?  You've got all this information
and a lot competition among news sources and then you're competing
with the near-news and there is a danger that too much stuff cramming
in on people's minds is just as bad for them as too little in
terms of their ability to understand.&quot;
   </i>   <br><b>-- President Clinton</b>
<br>
               <I>The Washington Post</I>, 
                September 24, 1995
<P><hr width="50%">
<p> &quot;Too much information?&quot;  &quot;Near-news?&quot;  &quot;Ability
to understand?&quot;  In these informal remarks to a group of
reporters and producers, President Clinton appears to be having
second thoughts on the &quot;third wave&quot;.   In sharp contrast,
many commentators herald the much-acclaimed information revolution
precisely because it will empower individuals to convey and receive
their own news and information.  Who's right?  Are the many on-line
services, the Internet, talk radio and the sheer increase in electronic
outlets and programs a good thing?  More particularly, will they
lead to a more informed citizenry?
<P>
 There's no denying that Americans now enjoy an ever-expanding
range of outlets from which they can get a wealth of news and
information programming.  Focusing only on the electronic media,
98 percent of all U.S. homes can receive the major TV networks,
of which we now have four.  More than 90 percent of all households
can subscribe to cable TV and roughly 60 percent do.  Eighty-five
percent of all U.S. homes have VCRs.  Almost all can subscribe
to two one-hundred-channel direct broadcast TV systems (DBS) and
over a million have done so in the space of a year.  Ninety-four
percent of Americans can receive more than five TV  stations,
most of which carry locally originated programming.  By subscribing
to either cable or DBS, they can have more than a 100 additional
networks of information and programming.  Increasingly, AM radio
stations are adopting talk radio formats.  Local or nationally-syndicated
talk show hosts are giving millions of Americans the opportunity
to listen and discuss the issues of the day with  each other.
 Anyone with a telephone line, at least a 286 computer and modem
can access an online service and the Internet.  The three biggest
online services claim over 8 million subscribers and the entry
of Microsoft's new online service has caused sharp price reductions.
 
<P>
 Not surprisingly, this period of unprecedented change and opportunity
is causing many new companies to enter the market while others
are consolidating or forming alliances with each other.  Notably,
some of the nation's largest telephone companies are preparing
to enter the video market using their own facilities or recently
acquired radio frequencies.  At the same time they are forming
their own production companies and forming alliances with the
owners of existing programs.  Recently, three big networks, CBS,
ABC and TBS, have been acquired by large media companies.  
<P>
 Paradoxically, these developments have created two competing
sets of concerns for those leery of the ongoing changes in the
marketplace of ideas.  On the one hand, there are the President's
worries that the quality of the public debate is declining.  For
example, will the plethora of news sources make it too difficult
to carry on a coherent national discussion?  Do the talk show
and online discussions too often stray from the facts?  Or are
they too shrill, uncivil, or illiberal?  
<P>
 On the other hand, the Clinton Administration worries that the
House and Senate telecom bills  about to go to conference will
unduly relax statutory limitations on broadcast ownership.  Apparently,
the concern is that possible broadcast mergers may stymie public
debate by giving large companies too much control over the marketplace
of ideas.  Is the fear that we will then end up with too little
diversity of &quot;stuff cramming in on people's minds?&quot;
 
<P>
 Neither of these concerns is well-founded.  First, the Administration's
concern about media concentration is misplaced, especially if
the focus is on the broader marketplace of ideas.  Americans are
now enjoying  the benefits of more speakers than ever before even
if limited to traditional electronic media.  Given that the current
mergers are taking place in relatively unconcentrated markets
with low barriers to entry and are still subject to traditional
antitrust review, it is reasonable to assume that they are motivated
by the desire to become more efficient.  In competitive markets
any such improvements will largely benefit viewers and listeners,
often by improving program quality and diversity.  In addition
to existing competition, more and more Americans have wholly new
ways to express and receive ideas -- talk radio and online services
being two examples.
<P>
 Second, rather than be concerned that Americans are receiving
too much information which is reducing their ability to understand,
we should celebrate the new power Americans now enjoy to get news
and information.  This &quot;demassification&quot; of the media
(Alvin Toffler's term) will allow Americans, when they choose,
to get their news unfiltered through the established media.  This
is not to say that the reputation of news sources is not important.
 In fact, a speaker's trademark may become even more important
to listeners in the information age.  Listeners will continue
to have strong incentives to use trademarks and their own good
judgment to discern quality speech and speakers from the rest.
 What will be different is that a speaker's cost of reaching widespread
audiences has plummeted and will continue to fall.  
<P>
 This process is fundamentally healthy.  Old established speakers
with established franchises are and will continue to be challenged
by new sources.  Currently distrustful citizens will have alternatives
to turn to.  The old and the new media will criticize, check and
ultimately improve each other.  Remember the concerns the print
industry had regarding the introduction of radio?  Those who worry
about the onslaught of information and &quot;near news&quot; would
do well to remember the fundamental insight of Judge Learned Hand:
&quot;The First Amendment presupposes that the right conclusions
are more likely to be gathered out of a multitude of tongues,
than through any kind of authoritative selection.  To many this
is, and always will be, folly; but we have staked upon it our
all.&quot;

<title>Breaking the Telecom Logjam -- PFF</title>

</HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>
<P>

<h2>Breaking the Telecom Logjam
</h2>
By <a href="/pff/people/director.html">G.A. Keyworth, II</a>
<P>
	As the House and Senate Conferees resolve the differences in the telecom bills passed by their respective bodies, they should keep one imperative in mind: "It's time to break the telecom logjam."  For the average American  these bills have undoubtedly gotten lost in a confusing swirl of competing claims and counterclaims about whether the bills will foster or undercut telephone competition.  Of late, the public discourse has been further confused by Clinton Administration contentions that the telecom bills would lead to undue media concentration and price gouging by cable TV companies.
<P>
	While widespread disaffection with this process would be understandable, a "pox on both your houses" attitude is a mistake.  The stakes for American consumers and workers in reforming telecom policy are immense.
<P>
	Starting in the mid-1970s Congress has time and again considered telecom legislation only to see the process stumble, stall and fail.  In this vacuum, the antitrust divestiture court, Federal Communications Commission, and the 50 states have set telecom policy.  At the national level, pro-competition policies were promoted by the divestiture court and the FCC.  Competition in the long distance, telephone equipment, and information services markets has flourished.  While some states have begun to open local telecom markets to competition, Congress now has a unique opportunity to jump-start this process by preempting state and local entry barriers and liberalizing related long distance, cable and broadcast regulation.  Congressional action would free up this dynamic sector and assure that the competitive process evolves naturally and produces a myriad of new digital services at the lowest possible cost.
<P>
	The importance of these coming contests is underscored by the many impressive preparations the combatants are undertaking to ready themselves to compete.  Most notable is AT&T's recent announcement that it will divest its network equipment business.  This second divestiture by AT&T will free it of any business conflicts with the Baby Bells who buy a lot of network equipment as it begins to compete in local telephone markets.  AT&T also has acquired McCaw Cellular, the largest independent cellular company, giving it the "wireless" capacity to compete with local telephone companies.  Also, a  consortia of cable companies and Sprint made winning bids of more than $2 billion in recent FCC auctions for wireless frequencies.  Finally, Hughes Satellite, Hubbard Broadcasting, Motorola and others have or will be embarking on satellite strategies.  These developments represent only a glimmer of the competitive energies that these telecom bills are about to unleash.
<P>
	The Clinton Administration and others claim that  passage of these bills would be a mistake.  They contend the bills will permit undue media concentration, lead to higher cable TV rates, and insufficiently guard against abuse by the Baby Bells of their local telephone monopoly.  These objections are either misplaced or can be worked out.
<P>
	The bills will not permit undue media concentration for two reasons.  First, all significant media mergers would still have to pass antitrust review.  Second, the radio and television markets (where the critics are most concerned) have seen hundreds of new stations come on line in the past five years, have low levels of concentration and face powerful challenges from competitors offering hundreds of channels, such as direct broadcast TV satellites (DBS), cable TV systems and telephone "video on demand" systems.
<P>
	Likewise, intrusive cable rate regulation is no longer productive.  Aside from the fact that cable faces competition from broadcast and DBS, cable regulation has simply not worked well.  It has been difficult for regulators to regulate cable systems, because cable prices are only one of several variables within the cable operator's control.  As a result cable rate regulation has likely led cable operators to reduce programming investment and quite possibly explains the failure of  the cable-telephone mega-mergers announced in 1993.
<P>
	The competitive issues implicated by the dispute between the local and long distance companies are admittedly more complex.  As much as we can be hopeful that local competition will flourish in most areas for most Americans, we are not there yet.  What preconditions the Baby Bell companies should meet before being allowed to enter the long distance market is something over which reasonable Nobel Laureates can disagree.  The House and Senate proposals are reasonable ones, though, and the time has come for the legislative leaders and President to cut the Gordian knot.
<P>
	These bills are not perfect by any means.  For example, they duck the important issues of reducing residential phone subsidies and freeing up radio spectrum use.  A Progress & Freedom Foundation study recommended these reforms as part of a fundamental reform package which would replace the Federal Communication Commission and rely even more on market forces.  These and other legislative improvements will have to await a "second" bite of the apple.
<P>
	Finally, there is no denying that these complicated bills evidence a lot of  "sausage-making."  Nonetheless, they replace a smorgasbord of federal law, FCC rules, divestiture court jurisprudence and state regulation.  In so doing, the telecom legislation would open local telephone markets to competition from long distance and cable TV companies, open the long distance market to competition from the Baby Bells, and open cable TV markets to competition from the local telephone company.  While many important issues would be left to the FCC and state regulators, reform along the lines of the bills would constitute a "great competitive leap forward."

<h2>How to Speak up for the GOP Revolution</h2>

by <a href="/pff/people/sfellow.html#Higgins">Heather Higgins</a>
<P>
We have heard much in the past year about the internal divisions
of the Republican coalition and how those strains would first
polarize, then fracture, this revolutionary venture.  The moderates,
we were told, would balk at the cruelty of the &quot;Contract
with America&quot; and break from the extremism of the budget.
 The extremists, went the theory, would alienate the moderates
by rejecting the politically possible in pursuit of the politically
pure.  We were blessed with those profound insights before the
election; which continued after the election; they went on through
the Contract (remember how the &quot;hard part&quot; was always
just ahead?), up into the appropriations process and the budget
debate; and now they are part of the primary campaigns.  The point
has been that collapse is just around the corner.
<P>
It isn't.  Not because there aren't differences -- there are.
 But because Republicans know there are, and have therefore quite
consciously worked on operating as a team.  They know that in
any majority coalition, by definition, there will be differences.
 The problem is to first find the  common ground and the common
language that holds the coalition together and advances its agenda.
<P>
This is not only common sense, it has been the reality of our
political life since the founding.  The American Revolution became
possible when those favoring economic liberty joined forces with
those seeking a virtuous society.  Yet that coalition, so much
an analogue to the present day, only coalesced when the two sides
learned a common vocabulary -- words such as &quot;liberty&quot;
and &quot;providence&quot; that galvanized all concerned.
<P>
If there is a problem with the Republican coalition, however,
it is that much of the managing is by deferral -- the &quot;tough&quot;
issues are on hold until later in 1996, or even 1997.  This is
understandable; control of Congress came more quickly than expected
and is still numerically slim, making the immediate challenges
first  a swift transition and then advancing an identifiable GOP
legislative agenda.  Not much time, if any, was left for the further
careful stitching together of  this quilted coalition.  This is
the weakness that is about to be exploited, as the latest  argument
for internal division in the Republican ranks.
<P>
The claim is this.  The Republican split is not so much between
moderates and extremists.  Rather, on the one side is the &quot;Leave
Us Alone&quot; coalition, identified in a phrase made famous by
key Republican strategist Grover Norquist when characterizing
the commonalties between gun owners, taxpayers, home-schoolers,
small business owners and others (Mr. Norquist contrasts this
with the &quot;Takings&quot; coalition of  Democrats, comprised
of those who want something from government that has been taken from others.)   On the other is
what the Wall Street Journal  portrayed on the last Friday of
the year alternatively as &quot;civil-society Republicans,&quot;
 communitarians&quot;, &quot;big-government conservatives&quot;
those who ostensibly wish to use the power of the state to promote
virtue, for example through tax credits for charitable giving.
<P>
Leave aside the flaws in the argument -- for example, the fact
that there are  substantial differences between the policy preferences
of communitarians as opposed to civil-society conservatives, or
the fact that tax credits are endorsed by many in the &quot;Leave
Us Alone&quot; coalition as an excellent way of removing power
from the state and restoring it to citizens.  The argument that
there is a conflict of visions is still powerful.  It captures
a real concern felt within republican ranks.  The fear is this:
Presume we do leave folks alone, then what happens?  Saying they
want to be left alone sounds pretty anti-social and selfish. 
Will sufficient people contribute to charity and help those who
need help?  Or will they look at the infirm, the aged, the sick
and the needy and choose to leave them alone?
<P>
What is meant by the &quot;Leave Us Alone&quot; coalition is quite
different from how it often has been characterized.  It's not
that Republicans aren't clear what they mean -- talk to strategists
like Mr. Norquist and it becomes apparent that they have a robust
vision of a strong civil society fully committed to addressing
our social problems.  But Republicans need to remember that these
are arguments that have not been articulated in political discourse
for some time.  In speaking about these ideas therefore -- particularly
given the Democrats' tireless depiction of Republicans as selfish,
greedy, and uncaring, they cannot use the shorthand they use among
themselves.  Rather, Republicans need to develop and use the common
ideas and language of the coalition if they are to resonate with
voters.
<P>
To say that Republicans represent a &quot;Leave Us Alone&quot;
coalition is simply and quite legitimately to explain what Republicans
want. To prevent a wedge being driven into the coalition, however,
it is critical that Republicans also start addressing why they
want it, and why others should as well.  Left in a vacuum, the
phrase &quot;leave us alone&quot; to the unaccustomed ear makes
no distinction between liberty and license, or civic-mindedness
and self-indulgence.  It provides no vision of  the kind of society
Republicans propose, and gives no assurance that the results will
improve, rather than worsen, the current situation.
<P>
In truth, however, the traditional American vision of limited
government and a strong civil society is a noble one.  Republicans
need to explain that in their view, Americans are trustworthy,
responsible adults. And adults should be &quot;left alone&quot;
in order to better carry out their obligations as citizens, in
order to exercise the responsibilities of authentic liberty.
<P>
Authentic liberty is not license; it is the freedom to do what
we ought to do, not whatever we want to do. And the freer a society,
the less intrusive the state, the more compelling the obligations
of individual citizens.
<P>
As commentator Dennis Prager points out, in the Torah, Moses doesn't
say to Pharaoh, &quot;Let my people go.&quot;  Rather, he says
&quot;Let my people go that they may worship their God.&quot;
 Or as Edmund Burke said, &quot;But what is liberty without wisdom,
and without virtue?  It is the greatest of all possible evils;
for it is folly, vice, and madness, without tuition or restraint.
 Liberty without purpose devolves into license and has little
social claim; liberty with purpose has the moral authority to carry a revolution.  The distinction is critical and needs to be articulated.
<P>
This language will be difficult for some.  As a coalition, for
example, Republicans tend to have a hard time with anything smacking
of &quot;caring&quot; and &quot;compassion&quot;.  It's not that
they object to the real article -- anyone who believes in minimal
government has indeed a deeper obligation to private charity --
but that in political discourse those words became a code for
&quot;government program.&quot;
<P>
Moral vocabulary, too, will be difficult.  The Progressive era
moved Americans away from a language of internal virtue and external
principles, providing instead a lifetime for the deliberately
relative language of &quot;values.&quot; Yet slowly, people are
beginning to realize that in life &quot;value-neutral&quot; is
itself a set of values, and that there are indeed some virtues
critical to any society which aspires to democracy, prosperity, and freedom.
<P>
Liberty is arguably the most powerful idea in American life, made
so by the complexity of the idea and the many visions to which
it speaks.  As David Fisher explains in &quot;Albion's Seed&quot;,
the &quot;most important fact about American liberty is that is
has never been a single idea, but a set of different and even
contrary traditions in creative tensions with one another... It
has become the most powerful determinant of a voluntary society
in the United States.  In fact, this plurality of freedoms may
prove to be the nation's most enduring legacy to the world.&quot;
<P>
Harnessed properly, understood in the context of its obligations
to civil society, liberty is also the resonant image that will
speak compellingly to the Republican coalition and convincingly
to the nation.

<TITLE>A Seven Step Recovery Program -- PFF
</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul>

<a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>
<br>
<h2>A Seven Step Recovery Program</h2>
<P>
by <a href="/pff/people/director.html#Huffington">Arianna Huffington</a>
<P>
The GOP has had a string of bad news recently: For the first time
since 1962, a Democrat was elected to the Senate from Oregon;
in a recent ABC/Washington Post poll, 74% disagreed with how the
Republican Congress is handling the economy (versus 50% disagreeing
with Clinton's performance); the GOP has been completely outmaneuvered
by Clinton on the balanced budget and has even retreated on its
promise not to raise the debt ceiling.
<P>
There are two ways for the GOP to deal with all these setbacks.
One: They can spin them. Two: They can heed them as the wake-up
call they are. So far they've chosen the spin cycle. They're comforting
themselves with transparent excuses: The defeat in Oregon was
too narrow to be significant; Oregon was one of only three states
to elect a new Democratic governor in 1994; Oregon voted for Dukakis
in 1988; it's the Senate with wimpy Republicans caving in; it's
the uncompromising House freshmen, recalcitrant and extremist;
it's Clinton, the Great Empathizer; it's Dick Morris, the brilliant
strategist.
<P>
As anyone familiar with 12-step programs can tell you, there is
nothing as inventive as the human mind in denial. And since the
GOP is unquestionably in denial, here is my suggested seven step
recovery program. (In the budget saving spirit of the times, we
have reduced 12 steps to 7.)
<P>
The first step for the GOP is to acknowledge that it has a problem.
<P>
The second step is to stop whining, especially about the media.
As some sage once said, the Constitution guarantees a free press
-- it does not guarantee a fair press. The GOP should forget about
whether the media is misrepresenting their message and go about
improving it.
<P>
The third step is to stop sounding like accountants and to begin
sounding like leaders. The good news for Republicans is that 80
percent of the American public wants a balanced budget. The bad
news for them is that so does Bill Clinton -- in seven years with
CBO numbers. So Republicans need to move the debate beyond balancing
the budget, not because this battle is over, but because, for
the moment, the President has framed the debate in way that makes
it impossible for Republicans to win. Both sides want to balance
the budget, but the President, in his own words, wants to &quot;balance
the budget in a way that reflects our values.&quot;
<P>
The fourth step is for the GOP to stop repeating, ad nauseum,
that it is not cutting anything -- but merely reducing the rate
of growth. This may be factually correct, but didn't Republicans
campaign on the theme of cutting things -- cutting government,
cutting entitlements, cutting taxes? Did they come to power to
reduce the rate of growth of government or did they came to power
to reduce government?
<P>
So instead of being so defensive about what they are doing, I
suggest that they take step five and be courageous enough to tell
the American people just what they want to do: reverse 60 years
of New Deal and Great Society thinking, according to which all
solutions to social and economic problems revolve around government.
Yes, this is bold, but a time of crisis requires boldness, decisiveness,
and honesty. This rethinking of the role of government has to
go hand in hand with a fundamental redefinition of the role of
the citizen -- challenging the American people to meet less from
Washington with more from themselves and their communities.
<P>
The sixth step, without which the revolution will remain stalled,
is to talk about community solutions -- about what is working
around America. They must talk about it not once in a while but
as frequently and as seriously as they have been talking about
balancing the budget. The GOP must go beyond just talking about
dismantling government, and start talking about what they are
going to replace it with. This is a critical step. When Newt Gingrich
first became Speaker, he was going to hold Congressional &quot;success
hearings.&quot; He was going to bring to the Capitol the community
leaders who are making things work and are turning lives around
-- introducing them to the American public as the people who embody
the alternative vision of rebuilding America.
<P>
The final step is to bring a sense of urgency to the debate --
to shift it from balancing the books in seven years to taking
steps right now to reform conditions in education, in welfare,
in the ways we deal with those most in need among us. Let Dick
Gephardt and David Bonior defend a broken system of government
programs that has left millions of children hungry, abused or
neglected, and let the Republicans speak of weaving a real safety
net from the involvement and resources -- in time and money --
of millions of Americans.
<P>
Instead of spinning all these setbacks or blaming the media, it
is time the GOP took these seven simple steps to produce a message
that has both economic and moral truth on its side. If Republicans
truly want to recover from what ails them, they must seize the
moral high ground without which no party can be a majority party.

<TITLE>Republican Dreaming -- PFF

<h2>Republican Dreaming</h2>
by <a href="/pff/people/staff.html#O_Donnell">Richard F. O'Donnell</a>
<P>
 Today, two zealous camps dominate public discourse over our future.
Techno-utopian Pollyanna's are busy proclaiming the unadorned
good of information technology while the neo-Luddites oppose the
same technological change.
<P>
 Between these two groups are the vast majority of Americans,
who do not quite understand all the hype over the Internet, know
that ATM machines are convenient, but do not want their jobs automated
away.  The message Americans are waiting to hear is that through
all the dislocation and turmoil caused by the coming of the Knowledge
Age are tremendous opportunities for better lives, and that the
ideas which made this nation great can still work in the future.
<P>
 This may explain the amazing number of Republicans one encounters
these days who have basically written off the 1996 Presidential
election, conceding a second term to a man who by almost all measures
does not merit one.  Clinton's poll numbers may be up and he threw
effective tactical roadblocks in the budget battle, but why this
sense of defeatism?
<P>
Republicans should be excited and full of anticipation at completing
what they began in 1994:  the destruction of the Democratic party
as the governing majority in American politics. To do deliver
a knock-out punch in 1996, Republicans need to offer as a challenger
to Bill Clinton a candidate who addresses Presidential - not Congressional
- issues.  Dick Lugar was exactly right when he said that all
the candidates for the GOP nomination want to balance the budget,
restore the 10th Amendment and overhaul the tax code.  The problem
is, these are <I>not</I> the issues with which to win the Presidency.
<P>
 What won Ronald Reagan the White House in 1980 was not his list
of top three public policy priorities (stronger defense, lower
taxes and balanced budget), but the sense that he could make America
stand tall again.  He offered the hope and optimism for a better
future to a nation suffering, as Carter put it, the malaise of
the 1970s.
<P>
 The leadership Americans want from the Presidency is one which
transcends the public policy debate and from a moral high ground
offers America a principled vision on how to build a better future.
 Many Republicans respond that they do have a national figure
offering just such leadership:  Newt Gingrich.  Yet Newt Gingrich
is Speaker, and although he amazingly used that office during
the past year to become, in essence, America's head of government,
his job is still necessarily partisan and deals primarily with
tactical public policy issues.  Only a President with the skills
and - Clinton's weakness - moral authority, can don the mantle
of Head of State, transcend partisan politics and lead the majority
of Americans.
<P>
 Republicans who say &quot;we just need to nominate someone who
won't stop the Revolution and let Newt continue to supply the
vision&quot; are handing Bill Clinton the election.  The Republicans'
dilemma is a Speaker who talks like a President and Presidential
candidates who talk like Congressmen. Only a candidate whose message
is of Presidential caliber stands a chance of beating Clinton
- and saying &quot;Newt's the leader of the Revolution and I'm
with him&quot; is not of that level.
<P>
 Lost last fall amongst all the uproar over Clinton's national
&quot;funk&quot; gaffe was a theme to which he returned in his
State of the Union address and that comes close being a full-fledged
vision.   In September he said that it is the President's job
to lead Americans through the &quot;tumult and upheaval&quot;
of the information-saturated 1990's.  In the seventh paragraph
of the State of Union - before he said the era of big government
is over - Clinton said:  &quot;We live in an age of possibility.
A hundred years ago we moved from farm to factory.  Now we move
to an age of technology, information and global competition. 
These changes have opened vast new opportunities, but they also
present stiff challenges.&quot;  Alvin Toffler or Newt Gingrich
could not have said it better.
<P>
 Yet none of the candidates for 1996, including Clinton, are offering
a realistic vision of America in the Knowledge Age.  Through his
veneer Clinton is as obsessed with stagnating real wages as Bob
Dole is with the fact that it's &quot;his turn,&quot; as Phil
Gramm is with economics, as Dick Lugar is with nuclear terrorism,
and as Steve Forbes is with &quot;Voodoo II.&quot;
<P>
 All these messages fail to adequately address the disquiet Americans
feel about their nation's future in the Knowledge Age.  Does Windows
'95 herald an information driven renaissance, or are millions
of people going to be driven out of work by increased computerization?
 Pat Buchanan is the only GOP candidate remotely addressing these
issues; he is tapping into a true vein of anxiety among voters.
 Unfortunately, Buchanan is offering up neo-Luddite solutions
that are merely a reaction at being left behind as the future
arrives.
<P>
Americans aren't sure where their nation is headed, and are looking
for a Presidential candidate to honestly describe the nature of
our times.  The New Deal era provided us with a vision -- interstate
highways, television, moon landings -- that to a stunning degree
was realized.  Yet this success was bittersweet, because once
we achieved its promises, we had no replacement vision and consequently
lost our sense of direction.
<P>
 This calls for reinventing the American Dream for a new century,
which is tricky business. Irving Kristol recently identified one
reason:  &quot;America has come of age, the American dream has
been fulfilled to the degree that any dream ever is&quot;.  When
you've fulfilled your dreams, it is tempting to sit back and dream
no more.  The dream Kristol believes fulfilled -- and thus no
longer useful -- is one created for 20th century industrial America.
What we need now is a Dream for 21st century Knowledge-Age America.
<P>
 Currently none of the Presidential candidates is offering America
a new Dream. Democrats dream about high wages and universal health
insurance whereas Republicans dream of making a bundle. &quot;Necessities
or securities, but hardly the stuff of dreams,&quot; said <I>The
Nation</I>. The problem with both parties is that they are pecuniary.
<P>
 Yet, when all is said and done, Americans are Americans for reasons
larger than a dollar. Yes, we all want to be prosperous.  Yes,
we all want a less burdensome tax code.  But we hold other ends
in higher esteem.  Americans enjoy the sense of meaning that comes
from belonging to causes outside themselves, whether a revolution,
settling the frontier or racing to the moon.
<P>
 The great challenge for us today, something worthy of a Dream,
is to take all the new tools of the Knowledge Age and use them
to build a better society while minimizing the disruption and
dislocation these same tools will engender as we replace the ways
of the industrial world.
<P>
 It is this void which is driving the radical middle in American
politics.  Our nation is searching for a new Dream, for a new
goalpost toward which to strive.  Americans are looking for a
President who talks about more than just the public policy issues
of balanced budgets, states' rights and tax code reform.  Americans
want someone to show them that through all the confusion and seeming
chaos, the electronic frontier beckons us toward ever greater
freedom, creativity, individuality, community and progress.  If
the Republicans want to win the Presidency this year, their nominee
must, in addition to discussing the proper size and scope of government
in society, engage Americans in a discussion about the future
of their society itself.

<h2>Reflections on the Revolution</h2>
By <a href="/pff/people/sfellow.html#Weber">Vin Weber</a>
</center><P>
<P>
<I>&quot;One has a feeling of going it blindly because we are
in a tremendous stream and none of us knows where we are going
to land.&quot;</I>
<br><I>       --Eleanor Roosevelt</I>
<P>
 As Americans prepare to vote in the forthcoming Presidential
election, our national politics is in turmoil.  The 1990s has
witnessed the greatest challenge to the legitimacy of the two
major parties in modern times.  George Bush went from stratospheric
approval ratings to losing the Presidency in a three-way race
in which Ross Perot received the largest percent of the popular
vote of any third party candidate since Teddy Roosevelt.  Yet
just two years later, the Clinton Presidency lay in shambles as
the Republicans took control of Congress for the first time in
40 years. The American electorate increasingly identifies not
with Republicans, nor with Democrats, but with a party that does
not (for all intents and purposes) exist -- the &quot;independents.&quot;
<P>
 As elected officials daily flee their membership in the Democratic
party, Americans are increasingly confused over whether the parties
stand for anything.  Is there such a creature as a &quot;New Democrat,&quot;
or is Bill Clinton's party still a high tax and spend coalition
of liberal interest groups?  Where are the Republicans heading,
toward the reactionary Buchanan or the futuristic Gingrich?  When
asked what percentage of promises they thought politicians typically
broke, Americans recently responded with the staggering total
of 78 percent.  During Ross Perot's mercurial Presidential challenge,
70 percent of the American people declared no confidence in either
political party.
<P>
 National politics during the 1990s is driven by the simple fact
that Americans believe, as Ross Perot so succinctly put it, &quot;the
government is broken and we need to fix it.&quot; Whether it is
the national debt, decaying inner cities or regulatory burdens,
 citizens feel that the Federal government is less an ally than
a threat to their making the good life.  Fewer than a third of
the American people believe that the government does the right
thing -- down from about 80 percent a couple of decades ago. 
The voters place the blame for this squarely on the seeming inability
of elected officials' from both parties to produce the necessary
changes.
<P>
Yet through all this confusion a new vision for the proper role
of government in society is emerging to replace the legacy of
the New Deal (the idea that centralization, bureaucracy and government
could solve every problem).  It is around the principles of the
information age that the vision of a New Majority coalition will
form and define a new era in American politics.
<P>
It is difficult to describe the new era because our political
discourse is still dominated by the language of the New Deal/Great
Society era.   Many political analysts still talk in terms of
stitching together a coalition of interest-based demographic groups.
 When Eleanor Roosevelt spoke the words above in 1932, the people
coming together to form the New Deal did not yet know where they
were going.  It took them a generation to develop the language
with which we today are so familiar.  Today's emerging New Majority
finds itself in much the same position as the First Lady --  they
know they are leaving the past behind and creating a new political
order, but they do not yet know where they will end up.
<P>
 Replacing an old political order is messy and confusing.  It
often seems as if the public is not sure exactly what it wants.
 On the one hand -- if you believe the results of the 1992 Presidential
election - the voters say they want an activist government.  Yet,
when they tried to create an  &quot;activist&quot; health care
system, President Clinton and the Democrats were rejected.  The
public then embraced a Contract with America that called for drastically
delimiting the power of the Federal government.  Taken as a whole,
these conflicting demands signal an era of change.
<P>
 American politics is no longer a fight over the size of New Deal
programs.  Since FDR, voters may have argued over how much should
be spent, but the majority of Americans never questioned the fundamental
principle of the New Deal:  that Federal government programs were
the appropriate way to solve America's problems, whether old-age
pensions through Social Security, the poor through welfare, or
pollution through the Environmental Protection Agency.  And the
truth be told, there was little reason for Americans to question
this principle because, by and large, the New Deal and its programs
<I>did </I>make the United States a better place to live.
<P>
 But today that is no longer so.  Social Security and Medicare
are near bankruptcy and will not be able to support the Baby Boomers
as they begin to retire early next century (now less than four
years away).  No longer is welfare helping widows and infants,
but instead facilitating an urban underclass that threatens to
tear apart America's social fabric.  And Federal regulations have
gone from the sensible to the absurd. The reason these programs
suddenly seem to be the problem rather than the solution is that
the world in which they were created no longer exists.
<P>
 American society is transforming itself away from the industrial
age that has dominated the past century just as surely as it moved
away from the agrarian age during the time of our nation's founding.
 &quot;Our age&quot; is yet to be determined.  We know that it
will be overwhelmingly influenced by the information technology
that is now upon us -- every day we hear something new about the
Internet, Cyberspace and virtuality.  This is already manifesting
itself in our politics.
<P>
The so-called Republican Revolution of 1994 occurred not on election
day but the moment President Clinton's bureaucratic and centralized
health care plan died in a Democratic Congress.  Americans rejected
an industrial age design being imposed upon them in the information
age.  Nothing demonstrated the death of the New Deal paradigm
more than President Clinton's recent balanced budget proposal.
 It was not the balanced budget per se that was important. It
was that the man who campaigned as a &quot;New Democrat&quot;
capitulated to the philosophical direction of the New Majority.
It was no longer a debate about increasing government spending,
taxation or centralization of programs (like health care) but
about a totally new political direction - smaller, less centralized
government.
<P>
Just as the election of Eisenhower did not mean the end of the
New Deal's philosophical hegemony, neither would Bill Clinton
or any other candidate's election in 1996 mean the end of the
emerging principles of the New Majority. As all successful revolutionaries
know:  There comes a time to stop the revolt, know you have destroyed
the old order, and begin building a new one.
<P>
<B>The Role of Government: Devolve, Diffuse and Connect Through Competition &amp; Community</B>
<P>
 The outlines of the principles on which to build the new political
age are becoming clear.  The bureaucratic, centralized government
design will be replaced because the information age demands a
new organization. As General Motors, IBM and AT&amp;T have learned,
decentralization and human capital are the hallmarks of the new
age.  While the private sector has been learning this lesson for
more than a decade, government and academia have been the last
to understand the new era.
<P>
The three major trends that will enable this to occur in the new
era will be devolution, diffusion and connection. Devolution is
sending power and responsibility to the lowest level possible
for effective decision-making.  Shifting from federal to state
or local control is just a trickle today. Within a few years it
will be a flood. The pioneering efforts of such states as Wisconsin
and Michigan will be recognized as the beginning. If Medicaid
and Welfare are returned to the states, this trend will have been
firmly established.
<P>
 Diffusion is relying on non-governmental organizations or individuals
to perform many of the functions government usurped during the
industrial era.  The use of vouchers, privatization, voluntary
organizations, charities and churches are among the tools of diffusion.
Cities such as Indianapolis and Jersey City are building models
of diffusion.
<P>
I need to make one cautionary point about diffusion. Ronald Reagan
used to talk about how the &quot;dead hand of government&quot;
would stifle and cripple mediating institutions, and he was right:
Voluntary organizations' and charities' original social purposes
withered because of government's absorption of their functions
into the welfare state.  It is obvious that government cannot
immediately withdraw from these functions and expect churches
and charities to automatically fill the void. These &quot;charitable
muscles&quot; have not been exercised in a long time, and there
must be a transition period during which government gives over
these responsibilities while charitable institutions regain the
skills and knowledge to reclaim their original purposes.
<P>
 The final trend is connection. This has less to do with government
than with individuals. We must return to the sense of community
we once had.  The most important people are those closest to you.
You must want to help -- and feel a responsibility for --  yourself,
your family, your friends and your neighbors. In this respect
I agree with Hillary Rodham Clinton's diagnosis of the problem:
It takes a village! I disagree totally with her prescribed cure:
 more intrusive government. Government cannot build villages;
it is more likely to raze them.
<P>
 To be able to devolve, diffuse and connect, America needs a serious
discussion about the role of government. As the disagreement with
Mrs. Clinton shows, this may be the definitive difference between
the evolving left and right in politics. It may take a Presidential
election as definitive as 1932 to cement the principles of the
New Majority as the reigning paradigm.
<P>
<B>The Ties that Bind: Our 21st Century Opportunity</B>
<P>
 The industrial era brought havoc to an unknowing and bewildered
populace.  Social norms and cultural promises were broken, the
economy shifted from one dependent on artisans and entrepreneurs
to one built by large-scale factories.  Workers moved from being
independent operators to cogs in assembly-line machines.  Individuals
lost control of their lives as it increasingly passed into the
hands of the experts, engineers and managers who determined the
rules of work.  These changes undermined people's  traditional
sense of order.  They scrambled for a new political paradigm that,
like the new factories, would emphasize mass programs, bureaucratic
control and order.
<P>
This order did not come to pass immediately. From the Progressives
at the turn of the century onward, an increasing number of Americans
began to coalesce around a conception of government and governance
that viewed centralized, bureaucratic programs as the appropriate
provider of solutions.  Yet it was not until the New Deal that
a majority of the electorate believed in this view of the role
of government, a conception that would dominate American politics
for the next 40 years.
<P>
The emerging majority realizes that the principles behind the
New Deal are dead, and voted for Republican control of Congress
in 1994 to bury its programs as well.  Yet this begs a question:
 What next?  If the animating spirit of the New Deal will not
work for this new information age, what will?  Is there a new
view about the role of the government in American life around
which a new political majority will form?
<P>
 The answers are still vague, but broad outlines seem to be coming
into focus.  Government, especially government in Washington,
will have a diminished, supportive role rather than the supreme
role it has enjoyed.  With the national government no longer seen
as the solution to all our problems, national politics will no
longer be a zero-sum game of who gets the next Federal program
enacted for their cause and who gets to impose their views on
whom.  Government will instead focus on empowering citizens and
the communities they form to solve their own problems.  Through
the use of vouchers and other tools, people will choose the best
means to achieve their goals, rather than be subject to the one-size-fits
all approach of today's government programs.  The vision of the
New Majority recognizes communities (mediating institutions) are
the strength and backbone of a healthy American civilization,
and pluralism the answer to competing values.

<h2>Are We Reliving the 1850s?</h2>
<P>
by <a href="/pff/people/sfellow.htm#Vlahos">Michael Vlahos</a>
</center><P>
 <ul><blockquote>
The Big Election fanned The Talk.  Now everyone in town was asking,
is the realignment that comes every two or three generations really
upon us?  Is this the next Big Change in American politics?
<P>
And the next question was always:  Which realignment?  Is this
one more like 1932 or 1896?  Long wave theories trotted out. 
Names like Hanna and Bryan were heard again.
<P>
But with Oklahoma City and Waco, murmurs of the 1850s began to
lace The Talk.  On the evening of the Million Man March, the Speaker
of the House came right out and said it:  today is like the 1850s.
<P>
The 1850s were scary times.  People killed for ideology, called
the government corrupt and tyrannical, and dreamed draconian national
solutions.  
<P>
But it still looks like a pretty superficial stretch ... that
is, until I read Bill Gienapp's <I>Origins of the Republican Party,
1852-56.  </I>He tells a riveting story, a remarkable feat for
600-odd pages in micronic font, broken only by maps of county-by-county
voting.  Why is it so compelling?
<P>
Because even when you get down to details, the talk and feel of
another time:  it reads like today.
<P>
I wanted to put this historical deja vu to the test, so I sought
out Professor Gienapp.  I wanted to lay out all the leaping associations
and harmonic resonances, and see what the sober historian would
have to say.
<P>
Here, in thumbnail, is how it went.  I started by laying out the
case:
<ul><P>
<B>The Dem's in 1852.</B>
<P>
We like to talk about how Democrats have dominated politics since
the New Deal.  But the Democracy of the 1850's [as they liked
to call themselves] had run the show since America began.  In
1860, we could look back on slave-owning presidents for 50 our
our first 71 years.  The majority of Speakers of the House, of
Presidents <I>Pro Tem</I>;  and <I>always</I>, a majority of the
Supreme Court, was Southern.  The Southern Democrat vision of
American politics <I>was</I> American politics.
<P>
<B>The Economic Revolution.</B>
<P>
We are abuzz with an Information Revolution.  But Americans then
were laboring to adjust to something even more elemental:  an
Industrial Revolution.  The Big Change that would transform American
life was just starting its sweep in the 1850's, as the great urban
migration hit railroad stride.  City populations doubled and tripled:
 New York went from 20% urban in 1850 to 40% in 1860.  And the
yeoman farmer was being displaced by the factory worker.  In 1860,
wage laborers for the first time equaled the self-employed.  And
the new world was being built in the North.  The South was being
left behind ... along with its grip on political power.
<P>
<B>The Death of the Whigs.</B>
<P>
For decades the Whigs had been the second party:  the party of
economic growth.  But they had lived under the shadow of the Democrats,
and having made their compact with The Democracy, they dared not
challenge the arrangements that gave Democrats political sway.
 But the narrow fiscal issues around which they had crafted their
platform had all dried up.  Whigs had nothing to say to people
in the new world being made by railroad and mill.  Does this remind
us just a bit of our own Country Club Republicans?  Having nothing
to say, the Whigs crashed and burned in the election of 1992;
 I mean, 1852.
<P>
<B>The <I>Know Nothings</I>.</B>
<P>
From the wreckage of the Whigs came two new parties.  By far the
biggest, representing regular people in both North and South,
was the North American Party, who also styled themselves <I>Know
Nothings</I>.  These were people who saw their way of life eroding,
their hope for the future slipping away.  Economic revolution
was creating a new world of wage labor, of industrial slums, and
of job competition with the millions of immigrants pouring into
American life.  <I>Know Nothings</I> were anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic,
much the way workers today are anti-immigrant and anti-UN/NAFTA/WTO,
where the immigrant is the embodiment of large change threatening
their job, and where the foreign institution poking into American
life threatens liberty itself.  Their ranks are filled with Protestant
evangelicals, and their vision is full of nostalgia for a better,
truer, American Dream from a world gone by.
<P>
<B>The New Republicans.</B>
<P>
The Republicans, in contrast, come as the party of revolution.
 They looked to the future, and to a renewed American Dream. 
Their ranks were flush with old abolitionists, once marginal to
the political scene, who now saw their chance to bring sacred
principles to the center of politics [they acted a little like
some Libertarians we know].  And they have the support of new
money, the new entrepeneurs of the industrial age.  Money flows
in from the high technologies, the <I>parvenu</I> corporations
built on iron rails.  But Republicans have a problem: the <I>Know
Nothings</I> are a majority in the North.  How to woo them, how
to make a new national party - not like the old Whigs, built on
fiscal probity, nor like the <I>Know Nothings</I>, on nativism
- but on a new vision of American life?
<P>
<B>The Issue.</B>
<P>
We still think the issue was slavery ... getting rid of it, that
is.  The truth is  Republicans did something very different. 
They ditched whining, moralistic cries for abolition.  They said
instead:  <I>The ruling Old Order of Democrats and comprador Whigs
is a monster, slowly robbing Americans </I>[white male voters]<I>
of their liberty.  And because it is on the defensive, it has
turned aggressive, so it must be stopped now</I>.  And Republicans
called this Old Order, <I>The Slave Power</I>, the vested interest
of the past, European in its concept of hierarchy and rule, and
so inimical to American virtue and the American idea.  What this
meant is that Republicans took people's fears of change and uncertainty
about their future, which had fastened on a mix of neighborhood
scapegoats [immigrants] and ethereal tyrannies [the Catholic Church],
and turned them on the reigning political elite and its paradigm
of rule.  It took the Christian right of 1854 and said:  to get
to a better America, to renew the American Dream, we must first
destroy <I>The Slave Power</I>. 
<P>
Looking back, what will people say about us?  Can we frame the
battle as well as those first Republicans?
<P>
<B>The Talk.</B>
<P>
Paranoid politics?  Why, yes.  As Gienapp points out through his
narrative, it is the heart of American political tradition.  Our
first revolution made it so.  In the nineteenth century the big
conflicts in American politics were all conspiracies directed
against Liberty.  For the Jacksonians, it was the Banks.  For
the Whigs, it was the power of the Executive Branch.  For the
<I>Know Nothings</I>, it was the Catholic Church.  And for Republicans,
it was the Southern-dominated political system.  Conspiracies
against Liberty hearken back to our founding, and before our founding,
as the earliest Americans sought to escape European tyrants. 
It was inevitable that the main threat to Liberty would eventually
arise at home, from among our own.  People believed this ... <I>and
still do</I>:  it is an existential theme in America's Pilgrim's
Progress.  And set against a general backdrop of uncertainty and
upheaval in national life, the retro-look and feel of the Southern
political paradigm (and its manifest failure to lead nationally)
cried out for definition.  And define it the Republicans did.
   
<P>
The Democracy entered yet another administration in 1856, owning,
again, both houses of Congress and the Presidency.  But theirs
was a weak, pusillanimous Commander-in-Chief, whose venality and
corruption was exposed to all in 1860.  Republican success in
defining Democrats as an Old Order elite standing in the way of
progress, liberty, and America's future was there for everyone
to see in the mid-term election of 1858, when they swept Congress.
<P>
Here are some swatches from Gienapp on early Republican ideology:
<P>
At the heart of free labor ideology was the idea that every man,
as Abraham Lincoln phrased it, had a right to rise economically
and socially to the limit of his ability  ...  Upholding the reality
of the American dream, the free labor ideal represented the optimistic
side of the Republican appeal.
<P>
or,
<P>
As a heritage of the American Revolution ... the ideology of republicanism
... included the fear of concentrated power ... and the belief
that such power was the natural enemy of liberty and if unchecked
would eventually destroy it.
<P></ul>
Still<I> deja vu?</I>
<P><ul>
<I><B>What doesn't work.</B></I>
<P>
Well, not quite.  Uncompromising as historian, Gienapp restrained
this writer's rush to neatly tie things up.  He sees three dissonances
especially that should keep us from claiming immediate kinship
with Seward, Greeley, Chase, Sumner, and Lincoln. 
<P>
      
<P>
<B>The Voter and Voting.</B>
<P>
Who voted in the 1850's.  That's easy:  white men.  But there's
more.  These were very young white men, and they were deeply engaged
in politics.  They may not have had as much formal schooling,
but they knew the issues better than most of us today.  They lived
politics, chewed politics;  rallies and parades were their theater,
their TV.  It was cool to be hot and partisan, and these were
aggressive young men.  Look at their sacrifice in war just ahead.
<P>
Contrast that voter profile to today's.  The age pyramid is geting
stood on its head, and people who actually vote are much, much
older.  Hardly a revolutionary cadre.  And how we vote is different
too.  Government did not control voting:  in the 1850's, anyone
could print up a ballot and vote.  So it was easy for new parties
to emerge.  After 1900, the two parties have worked together to
control, to keep others out.  Gienapp puts it this way:  imagine
if Colin Powell, rather than slogging through the primaries, could
just hand out ballots!
<P>
<B>Party decomposition.</B>
<P>
And though the Whigs of 1852 could have stood in nicely for George
Bush, the debacle of 1992 did not lead to the party's fall.  It's
all still there,  Old Whigs, <I>Know Nothings</I>, and radical
Republicans, all under the same umbrella.  But keeping a lid on
means that instead of rollicking chaos, forcing creativity, and
then creating a new vision, Republicans shoulder on as the Grand
<I>Old</I> Party with three visions:  one Democrat-comprador,
one a nostalgia-mongering return to The Golden Age, and one of
revolution.  The old order Democrats, flat on their backs, thus
still survive.  In weak niches, like the presidency, they may
even flourish.
<P>
  
<P>
<B>The Issue as Talk.</B>
<P>
And where is slavery?  So many other features seem to be in place:
 the economic revolution, the fears of regular people, the obdurate,
grasping control of a dying elite.  But two things that make one
are missing.
<P>
The first is a driving vision of America's future.  True, the
first Republicans didn't have that at first.  They were all negative,
their issues all about stopping the power of government gone wrong,
dismantling the structures of that power itself.  But after 1856,
they became more positive.  Their slogan, <I>Free Men, Free Labor,
Free Soil</I>, had a message:  that economic change, however unsettling,
would offer more opportunity, more wealth, and more freedom to
all Americans.  They promised a renewal of the American Dream.
<P>
But that renewal would never happen as long as <I>The Slave Power</I>
stood in the way.  Its entire energy was intent on stopping change,
on cementing its control over American life and liberty.  <I><B>Progress</B></I>
and <I><B>Anti-Progress</B></I> were thus symbolically intertwined
as political message.
<P>
Some resonances to this message leaked out of the Great Health
Care Debate of 1994.  The Old Order was clearly painted as attempting
to aggressively extend its social-bureaucratic vision in order
to entrench its power.  People came close to politically visualizing
a contemporary counterpart to the old Slave Power in the form
of a national ruling class centered in Washington <I>[in one national
poll from November, 1994, Americans 2-1 said that Washington was
an imperial city ruled by an imperial class].</I> 
<P>
But since that election, the lines have blurred again.  The Democracy
was visited by, and made, huge mistakes in the 1850s, from Bloody
Kansas to the caning of Sumner.  Southern Democrats let the new
Republicans define them.  Today's old order is much more sly.
<P>
Perhaps it is too soon to talk loosely about the 1850s.  We may
be knee-deep in economic revolution, but it's not flood stage
yet.  But just wait until it threatens the brittle dikes of the
old politics, and its <I>ancien regime</I>. 
<P>
Then, on the [next] net, maybe we'll be printing our own ballots
again.

<P>
<h2>Whose Values Mr. President?</h2>
By <a href="/pff/people/staff.html#O_Donnell">Richard F. O'Donnell</a>
</center><P>
<P>
 Bill Clinton has left the Republicans speechless.  For months
now, every time the President said he wanted a budget reflecting
and upholding American values, Republicans responded they wanted
a budget balanced in seven years with real numbers.  Clinton finally
met their demand, producing a plan that he says balances the budget
<I>and</I> reflects American values.
<P>
 Calling his plan too &quot;liberal&quot; every time the President
tells Americans he is protecting Medicare, education and the environment
is not going to win the GOP many points in the court of public
opinion.  As part of a winning public relations strategy, Republicans
must answer head on each of the President's claims.
<P>
 Bill Clinton needs to be asked whose values he is claiming to
uphold in his Medicare proposals.  Are they the values of elderly
Americans relying on a healthcare program that even Clinton's
own advisers told him last spring faces bankruptcy without major
changes?  Are they the values of working Americans who will see
their payroll taxes continue to rise to unbearable heights to
fund an out-of-control cost spiral of a program? Or is Bill Clinton
still promoting the values of Ira Magaziner, who believes a one-size-fits-all
bureaucratic health care system directed from Washington is the
best way for millions of Americans' healthcare decisions to be
made?
<P>
 Bill Clinton needs to be asked whose values he is claiming to
uphold in his education proposals.  Are they the values of parents
desperately seeking empowerment to choose the finest schools for
the education of their children? Or is Bill Clinton promoting
the values of the educational guild of tenured-teachers and politically
correct professors who want to nationalize education - taking
decisions away from communities - and force on children a skewed
view of history that denigrates heroes and celebrates supposed
victims?
<P>
 Bill Clinton needs to be asked whose values he is upholding in
his environmental proposals.  Are they the values of farmers,
ranchers, hikers and nature lovers across America who daily interact
with, are a part of and intimately understand their ecosystem
and want their children to enjoy its benefits also?  Or is Bill
Clinton promoting the values of EPA bureaucrats who, from cement
towers in Washington, D.C., call humans unnatural and purport
to know more about the forests of Oregon or the shores of Cape
Cod or the wetlands of Missouri than people whose families have
lived there for generations?
<P>
 Bill Clinton needs to be asked why he only wants tax relief for
working families.  Why not for job creators? Why not for investors
who take risks in creating new business ventures and growing the
American economy?
<P>
 In the lists of items the President says he wants to protect
is a significant omission:  welfare.  Although Clinton may hate
the GOP version of welfare reform, he knows the middle class wants
reform and the GOP has captured the moral high ground. Republicans
are protecting American values by replacing a system that discourages
work, forces people to live in housing fit only for rats and denies
generation after generation of our fellow citizens those rights
endowed to them by our Creator.
<P>
 Bill Clinton has been winning public sentiment because he is
claiming to protect and uphold the values of the middle class.
 Republicans should have reminded the President the past few months
that they want a budget balanced with real numbers because <I>they
too</I> are protecting American values:  those of thrift that
hold the government should balance its books, live within its
means and not mortgage our children's and grandchildren's future.
<P>
 It is time for the Republicans to ask Bill Clinton:  &quot;Whose
values are you protecting?  Those of normal Americans or those
of a politically correct, imperial elite with whom you communed
at Renaissance Weekend?&quot;  Such language will inflame liberal
journalists across the land, but the majority of Americans who
were <I>not</I> at Hilton Head will understand.
<P>
 The values Bill Clinton is claiming to protect are not those
of the middle class.  Americans are demanding the freedom to think
and choose for themselves how to live their lives without a bloated,
remote, debt-ridden government taxing and regulating them to death.
 This is what the '94 Revolution was all about.  These are Republican
values; they are nothing to be ashamed of and Republicans should
start defending them.
<P>
Republicans should not let Bill Clinton get away with claiming
he is protecting American values and they are not; it is time
for the President to be challenged and made to defend his values.
 This will assist in turning the debate away from the supposedly
&quot;mean spirited&quot; GOP efforts to reduce the size and scope
of government to why Bill Clinton is trying to preserve big, bureaucratic
government that does not represent the American people.

<I>The following remarks were delivered at &quot;The New Majority:  Democratic Governance in a Revolutionary Age&quot; conference, hosted by The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation on January 22, 1996.  The conference explored the possibility of political realignment and asked:  Is there a &quot;new majority&quot; taking shape in America and other western-style democracies?  Who is part of the new majority, what are its beliefs - and how is it related to the transition from an industrial to an information-age economy?  Which (if either) American political party is best positioned to represent it?  And, what impact will it have on the 1996 presidential election?

<p>
Many people infer that the title, The New Majority, has something to do with the recent events in the United States Congress, the development of a new majority, a Republican majority, in the House and in the Senate.  While that event in November 1994 certainly is part of the phenomenon we are describing, the new majority that we are talking about here today is in fact a much larger and broader phenomenon.  One of the underlying premises of the work that we do at The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation is the notion that we are in a time of Big Change, the transition from an Industrial Age to an Information Age, and a series of very profound cultural, economic, political and social changes that accompany that.  On the political side, that clearly will involve the creation of new coalitions, not only in politics, not only in America, but around the world.  
<p>
The new majority that we are talking about here today is an Information Age majority.  It is not yet clear which political party will represent that new majority, whether it will be called Republican, Democratic or by some new name.  Indeed, the politics of 1995 as they have played out have not, in my view, and in the view of many of those you will hear today, represented the politics of the new debate.  
<p>
In many ways, the Republican agenda as it's taken shape and been explained on Capitol Hill more resembles the fiscal conservatism of Herbert Hoover than the vision of Newt Gingrich.  By the same token, the Democratic minority on Capitol Hill appears to much better represent the Welfare State, Great Society message of Lyndon Johnson than the visionary speeches of President Clinton.  
<p>
We are in a time of Big Change.  It is a time of opportunity.  It is a time of danger.  Today we discuss what that means in terms of the shape of American politics, its implications for 1996, and its implications beyond.

<p><CENTER><B>Has there Been a Political Revolution?
by Vin Weber<B><SUP>*</SUP>

<p>
All the time I encounter political associates who argue that if such and such a thing happens, the Republican revolution will be over.  If we nominate the wrong presidential candidate or if Bill Clinton gets re-elected or if we don't get the right conclusion to the budget agreement, then the revolution will be over.  
<p>
I'm here to argue that the revolution <I>is</I> over, that we want the revolution to be over, and that we ought to think of the revolution as being over.  To think of an ongoing revolution is a mistake.
<p>
Revolutions are actions that overturn an existing order. Successful revolutions end quickly and then the revolutionaries get on with the business of rebuilding society consistent with the principles that drove the revolution.  I think it is a political mistake for Republicans to continue to talk about revolution.  It may stir the faithful, but it scares the average voter.  And more importantly, I think it misinterprets and incorrectly analyzes what the state of the country politically is and where we are.  Simply put: the revolution is over, we've won, and it's time to think more seriously about rebuilding society consistent with the principles that brought the revolution to power.
<p>
The first question people might ask is have we really won?  After all, Bill Clinton is still President, much of the Contract With America, perhaps most of it, will not become law until there's a change in the presidency, and there's ample reason to believe that we haven't changed the way the country is governed. I think that's all true. Yet, we have experienced a political revolution in the form of a major intellectual and ideological realignment.
<p>
A fundamental change in the way the voters perceive government, it's usefulness, it's ability to interact successfully with them, it's relationship to individual people and communities:  it is in this sense that I would argue that we had a successful revolution and a successful realignment, and we are now going about the business of rebuilding society.  
<p>
The last genuine realignment was in the 1930's, culminating about three decades of political turmoil in the country featuring Progressives and Populists and Bull Moosers and all sorts of other insurgents within the existing two-party order.  In 1933, Eleanor Roosevelt said &quot;One has a feeling of going it blindly because we are in a tremendous stream and none of us knows where we are going to land.&quot;  At the beginning of the great revolution that became known as the New Deal, with a huge mandate from the voters and being the most ideologically oriented person in the Administration, certainly much more so than her husband the President, Eleanor Roosevelt still had this sense that she was in a dark room and didn't really know where to go.  They were making up the New Deal as they went along.  For us to look back today, 60 years later, we could fall into the trap of thinking that this was all very carefully planned from the outset, the building of what we now call the Liberal Welfare State.  
<p>
It's important for us to understand that this wasn't the case.  You found that they made up quite a bit as they went along. Mrs. Roosevelt reflected most of the thinking of the New Deal: lots of optimism and lots of ideas, but not a clear plan in any sense.  They did, however, have a model that made a lot of sense to them and surprisingly that model really came from corporate America.  Some writers have argued only half facetiously that the real father of the New Deal was not Franklin Roosevelt but Henry Ford. Alvin and Heidi Toffler have written about the impact of what Henry Ford and other captains of industry did around the turn of the century in providing a model for the New Dealers when they went into government. Business was in the process of reorganizing and regimenting America, forcing massive population movements from the country into the city, organizing business along the factory model with hierarchically structured corporate organizations. Standardization was the key word.
<p>
The New Deal planners had this model of corporate America that seemed to be the wave of the future. Top down, hierarchical command and control structures, standardization, regimentation organization: That was how successful enterprises were organized.  It followed that government should be organized in the same way. It helped a great deal that President Roosevelt had the twin disasters of the Depression and World War Two to focus the country's attention, but nonetheless part of the process had been going on for some time.  In short, it just made sense to the American people.  By the end of Roosevelt's first term, people really had a new conception of how government should interact with people, and it was consistent with the other changes that they saw taking place around them.
<p>
Their conception of the proper role of government dominated our politics until 1980. It's imperative to recognize that it was not simply one party - although the Democrats benefited proportionally from it - but both parties basically accepted the same premise about how government should approach problem solving. The notion that the country swung back to the Republicans when Eisenhower was elected really is a misreading if you think about what happened.  Eisenhower, and Nixon as well, simply validated the New Deal, liberal welfare state approach to problem solving by embracing it.  Eisenhower was quite specific in office about saying he did not want to go back and repeal the New Deal.  He wanted to invent &quot;modern Republicanism.&quot;  Nixon, when he was in office, established the EPA, OSHA and imposed price controls.  In both cases, they accepted what had become the conventionalism since the successful Roosevelt revolution, which was that Federal Government activity, centrally structured, hierarchically organized, standardized in approach, was the way in which government operated to solve problems. 
<p>
The first President really not to be a part of that consensus was Ronald Reagan.  It's not that he was successful in rolling it back, but he really did not accept those premises and did not try in any way to expand the liberal welfare state as every President, Republican and Democrat alike, had done from Roosevelt up unto Reagan.  	
<p>

Now, to restate my basic point: I believe that a similar realignment in thinking has occurred.  Just as the realignment of our country's thinking that took place in the 1930's had gestated for 30 years or so with the Progressives and the Populists, there's been a long period of gestation and rejection of New Deal, Great Society liberalism today. It began with Barry Goldwater, who challenged the Republican Party's acceptance of those principles, and culminated in Ronald Reagan, who ran a campaign basically against the Welfare State.  
<p>
What confirmed the realignement was not so much the 1994 elections, but the health care debate earlier that year.  After the Clinton health care plan was interred in September of 1994 by <I>The Washington Post</I>, <I>The New York Times</I> and others, it was interesting to watch the analysis from all of the smarter-than-thou people around Washington - people in the media, people in the think tanks, people in politics - all explaining that, of course the Clinton health care plan was doomed from the start because&#133;fill in the blank.  Either because the President put his wife in charge of it, or because Ira Magaziner had never succeeded in anything, and 15 other reasons why.  Yet the amazing thing about the failure of Clinton's health care plan was that it failed.
<p>
It was the first time that a Democrat President, carrying a substantial Congressional majority, running a campaign based on a promise of a tangible benefit to a middle class constituency, addressing a real problem, failed to deliver.  He couldn't deliver not so much because he simply couldn't control or discipline his Congress, but because public support for it collapsed.  Support for Clinton's plan went from 60 percent plus when he initiated it to about 30 percent when it died.  It went from being the issue that many Democrats thought was going to be their key issue in preventing normal mid-term election losses, to the issue that by the last two or three weeks of the campaign Republican strategists were telling their challengers to use against the Democratic incumbent as symbolizing everything that they wanted to be against.  That's a remarkable transformation.
<p>
The more people learned about Clinton's plan, the less they liked it. They didn't like it because it was bureaucratic and costly and centralized and all those things.  So what's new?  Name me a New Deal Great Society program that wasn't attacked by Republican opponents as being bureaucratic, costly and centralized.  The difference is this time it worked.
<p>
The ratification of this revolution in people's thinking is the fact that President Clinton appears to have accepted it.  He has not reinitiated a new health care proposal, nor does Clinton have any other major new Federal initiatives that he's putting before the Congress.  In his 1996 State of the Union message, the President said &quot;the era of big government is over.&quot;  He talked a good deal about foreign policy success, bragged about the health of the economy, threw up a few liberal slogans on Medicare and Medicaid, but we saw no stirring defense of the Department of Commerce, no call for establishing any new Federal agencies.
<p>
That the President is already acting substantially within the parameters of the new context of American politics validates my argument that the revolution has succeeded.  In this regard, Clinton is less today Franklin Roosevelt or his hero, John Kennedy, than he is the Eisenhower of our new realignment, the first Democratic President to essentially govern within the constraints of this newly realigned country, with in the new thinking about the appropriate role for government.
<p>
The challenge, then, is not necessarily one of &quot;keeping the revolution alive,&quot; but to move ahead as quickly and wisely as we can with the rebuilding of society in the wake of the revolution.  That's hard work because although the public has largely rejected New Deal, Great Society, welfare state liberalism or whatever words you want to add to my description of it, there really is no evidence that they want to go back to a pre-New Deal conception of government.
<p>
Yet there is a great risk for Republicans to conclude this realignment is simply a dismantlingly of government. After all, in the 1992 election not too long ago, Democrats won largely on the issue of insufficient government activism. They argued that President Bush had no agenda domestically or economically, and people wanted more activism from their government.  The third party candidate, Perot, did not talk about diminishing or shrinking government, he talked about getting under the hood and fixing government.
<p>
Some pundits think the tension between an electorate seemingly wanting an activist government in 1992 and one wanting to greatly reduce the size of government in 1994 shows and immature and spoiled public. Supposedly voters want lower taxes and less government while demanding solutions to all the social problems like health care and the environment.  Many pundits say that voters can't have it both ways and are going to have to be forced to make a choice.
<p>
I don't think that's the case.  The public is sending a strong, strong signal to politicians that they want a different way of approaching problems, and they're going to be ready to turn politicians out until they find those people or parties that will devise a new solution, a new way of activism.  I don't have all the answers.  I think the outlines are beginning to come into shape somehow, probably more if you look at governors and mayors than at the federal level. Although some people like John Ashcroft and Dan Coats in the United States Senate are already talking very seriously about how to forge a new domestic policy, bringing in non-governmental organizations, churches and others more actively into the solution of some of our social problems.  Certainly at the level of governors and mayors, you find people like Steve Goldsmith in Indianapolis experimenting with new concepts, utilizing privatization, trying to grab a hold of community and tap non-governmental sources to solve problems.
<p>
There is, just as at the beginning of the New Deal, something to be invented today. We are only beginning to see its outlines.  It'll be very clear to people when they look back on it 20 or 30 years from now, but our challenge is to make sure that we get beyond the dismantling of the state and actually think seriously about how we build a conservative opportunity society, something that replaces the liberal welfare state. The party or people that do that will be the majority for another 40 years.

<CENTER><B>Who Is the New Majority?
by Frank Luntz<B><SUP>*</SUP> </B></B></CENTER>
<p> 
It is not an election itself that causes political revolutions.  If you ask Americans today whether they believe that there's been a change since 1994, three out of four would say not.  So if there's been a revolution, you better wake up the American people.  They don't see it.  Even when the Federal government was closed, 88 percent of Americans said it did not affect them at all.
<p>
Yet there is a new majority taking shape in the electorate.  The best way to understand a majority is to understand what the average American is like. 
<p>
She - because men smoke too much, drink too much, work too hard and die too young - is Jennifer Smith.  She's 32.7 years old.  She's white. She comes from European ancestry.  She lives in a mortgaged suburban home that has three bedrooms and a pet and is heated by natural gas.  She likes living there, but she is thinking about moving to something larger.  Jennifer is a happily married mother at least for now.  The strange thing about survey research is that I know she will become unhappy in about three or four years but I don't have the heart to tell her.  She watches about four hours of TV a day between work and raising a family.  She has a high school diploma, perhaps a little bit of college but she does someday hope to get that college degree.  She works in a service job but has higher aspiration.
<p>
Like her husband, John, Jennifer has her own car, and she drives to work alone each day.  There's a direct correlation, by the way, between those that car pool and registration of Democrats and Liberals. So whenever you see a car pool lane, you know that the people driving it are most likely to be Democrats.  Now the difference between her and her husband is that when they both reach a yellow light, she will stop and he will drive right through.  She attends church once a week, although she occasionally misses a week here and there.  She prays quietly to herself almost once a day, and she strongly believes in God.  Even though she feels the American dream is somewhat alive, Jennifer thinks the nation is in serious trouble and that some country other than America will be the number one economic superpower by the year 2020.
<p>
Emotionally, Jennifer is frustrated and anxious, particularly about crime and the economy, but she is less concerned than her husband.  She believes that the federal deficit is spinning out of control, and she thinks that her elected officials waste 48 cents out of every dollar.  She votes only once every four years.  She hates partisan politics and has very little confidence in the Federal government.  She does not trust politicians, and she's skeptical of the media, of lawyers and of the legal system - although she did follow the O. J. Simpson trial virtually every day.  She doesn't know if the two party system is salvageable, nor does she really care.  However, she does believe that her local community is headed in the right direction and she is somewhat optimistic that her own personal situation will improve.  She and her husband are charitable people; they do give more than one percent of their income to charity. They want to help those that are less fortunate, but they simply don't want their tax dollars going to Welfare.  They don't want the charity to come from Washington, to come from a bureaucracy. She's a patient person, but her patience is running out.
<p>
In short, Jennifer Smith believes in our government in abstract principles - democracy and capitalism for example - but she has little confidence in institutions - the Presidency, the Congress or the courts.  She believes in herself, but she wonders whether society will bring her down.  Jennifer and her 263 million compatriots see the American dream slipping out of their grasp and even farther out of the reach of her children.  She doesn't believe the American dream is dead - in fact, only 15 percent of Americans do - but she thinks it's very sick.  
<p>
(The problem that I have in saying that the new majority has won, that the new majority exists today and that it's in the Republican Party, is that the Republican Party has not successfully appealed to Jennifer Smith.)
<p>
That's a demographic look at the average American.  Now I want to give you an attitudinal look, and I want to start with what the new majority rejects because from a public opinion standpoint it is easier to tell you what they are against than to tell you what they are for.  
<p>
They reject the Federal welfare system above all else.  When you talk to a so-called member of the new majority, if you want to see the emotion and the passion, it doesn't come from a balanced budget.  It doesn't come even from crime.  What makes them really spitting angry - where they start to use four letter words -is the welfare system, how destructive it is, how unfair it is, how vicious it is, and how they want to eliminate it. If there's one great opportunity that Republicans have in 1996, it's to tie the welfare system around President Clinton's neck and sink him with it.  It's like lead boots that the so-called wise guys used to use on informants when they would throw them off some beach down south of Miami.  The welfare system is that around President Clinton's neck.  
<p>
What next makes members of the new majority most angry is the public school system, with increasing Federal control, mediocrity and the fact that there seems to be more bureaucracy to it.  They're angry at a Federal tax code that is anti-work, anti-investments, anti-savings and, when you talk to middle class, anti-success.  They reject the expense of Federal bureaucracy.  It seems to serve its own interest, and what freaked them out is something that came out of a David Letterman routine when he made the comment: &quot;If 80 percent of our Federal workers are non-essential, doesn't that send us a message?&quot; The one thing that I don't understand is why we Republicans did not draw the line back in December and say if they're not essential, why are they here, and if they're not working, why are we paying them? How many of you, if you don't come to work because there's a furlough, if you're not producing day after day and you're out of work for two weeks, three weeks, how many of your bosses or you yourself will get paid?  What are we doing paying people not to work?  It's insanity, and a new majority does not understand that.
<p>
The new majority rejects Federal regulatory-structure red tape.  They do not understand why it takes them so long to fill out forms, why it seems like the government is against them, why a small business can be shut down by OSHA if their toilet paper is one-quarter of an inch too high or too low.  They reject the legal system that has become the most expensive in the world and the most embarrassing at home.  They reject the anti-family mind set that permeates almost all of Washington's social, tax and welfare policies. They reject a government that can't even keep them safe. They reject the Washington ethic that encourages dependency and victimization:  Everyone in America seems to be a victim; It wasn't those poor Mendez brothers fault that they went in and gunned down their parents; They actually went out and reloaded so they could shoot again;  It wasn't their fault; It was society's fault, society to blame.  And, they reject the $5 trillion federal debt that is eroding America's ability to save and invest.
<p>
If there is a new majority, than current politicians, if they wish to succeed, must find a way to communicate to these people, to address their concerns, and not to play in this rhetorical game that we've been in right now. The Republican party is losing this budget debate, and if you think otherwise, then I don't know what TV shows you're watching.  Every day, from Leon Panetta to Donna Shalala, from Robert Reich to George Stephanopolis, they talk about values in the Clinton Administration.  They talk about principles.  They talk about being pro-family, pro-community, and even the President talks about spirituality.  What do Republicans do?  They talk about numbers, and fight over the nuts and bolts.  Any party that wants to lead the new majority cannot do that.  You cannot communicate in trillions and billions when the new majority understands things in hundreds and maybe if it's a mortgage in thousands.
<p>

The central questions the new majority wants answered is:  How many of you believe that you have a better quality of life today than your parents did when they were your age?  And how many of you honestly believe that your children will have a better quality of life than you when they reach your age? 

<p>
Why do so many people answer yes to the first question but not the latter? We have to understand why so many hands went up to the first question and so few hands went up to the second question. If the Republicans are to lead that new majority, as I certainly hope they are, because I don't believe in a third party, then the Republican Party has to communicate to all of you who said yes to the first question but not to the second.

<CENTER><B>Where is American Public Opinion Headed?
by Andrew Kohut<B><SUP>*</SUP> 
</B></B></CENTER><p>

If there's a revolution going on, it's not with the American public. We just see no indication that public opinion is in a revolutionary state.  It's certainly changing.  It's more evolving than being in a state of revolution.
<p>
We've been measuring basic political values since 1987.  Each year we do a major national survey and we ask people about how they feel about the government, the national economy and a whole range of social issues.  We see two persistent trends since 1987: less support or more suspicion of political leaders and more cynicism about the way the political system works, and less support for government solutions to national problems.  Consistently, each of our seven or eight measures which attempt to find out how much support there is for government solutions has shown an erosion of support since the mid-1980's.  In 1987, perhaps the average percentage of our samples saying they supported government solutions was at the 70 percent level.  It's slowly eroded to the 60 or 55 level, but it's still there.  
<p>
There is still clear majority support for Federal government solutions to help the poor, to provide a social safety net, to improve the environment, to deal with the problems of education and to deal with a wide variety of problems.  People no longer look to government to solve new problems.  Bureaucracy is in fact a dirty word, and government is seen more than ever as a court of last resort, but it is indeed seen as a court of last resort, and the American public doesn't want to see it go away. 
<p>
Looking at the past 12 months, what we see most clearly is that the public thinks that the new Republican majority on the Hill is cutting government too fast and too far.  They want welfare reform and they want government reform.  They want government changed, but they don't want to see it go away.  Whether they're correct in their perception, they think that the Republicans are going to do away with government to too great an extent.
<p>

I think the most important thing to recognize about American public opinion besides this discontent with the way government works, but still not a total disconnection from it altogether, is that we're in a cycle.  There's always been a change in the American public opinion between wanting the government to solve problems and not liking government, and when the emphasis is on the problems, then the American public doesn't pay a lot of attention to how inefficiently the Government works, or the downside to Government activity.  
<p>
The emphasis now is not on the problems.  People aren't up in arms about the problems of the poor.  The environment is a concern, but it's not a top concern.  The issues that are paramount to people aren't the kinds of things that were the case in the late 1960's and early 1970's when government programs really grew.  Therefore, there's much greater attention to the shortcomings of government activity and the discontents that have been mentioned here.  But the public has in no way in my view walked away from government.  It still wants government to do things that can't be done by the private sector or people can't do themselves, and the American public continues to feel that if all else fails the government should help solve problems - certainly not in the free form way that the American public felt 20 years ago, but nonetheless it's there.
<p>
The most important thing about the new electorate as we have measured it is not so much the left and the right - which are more clearly etched and defined than 10 years ago - but the fact that the middle has become what we describe it in our latest topology as the detached center, because it is so disconnected in terms of ideological thinking and political thinking from the left to the right.  The detachment isn't so much from political belief as it is from political system. The typical American is a high-school educated, middle-aged woman with no connection to the Republican Party or the Democratic Party and has very contradictory views about governance and issues of strong support of the environment, suspicious about higher taxes, worries about government yet a believer in social welfare.  So when I said there's no makings of a revolution in American public opinion, the nature of that political thinking is not revolutionary in the sense except in its detachment from the two political parties.

<I>The following remarks were delivered at &quot;The New Majority:
 Democratic Governance in a Revolutionary Age&quot; conference,
hosted by The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation on January 22,
1996.  The conference explored the possibility of political realignment
and asked:  Is there a &quot;new majority&quot; taking shape in
America and other western-style democracies?  Who is part of the
new majority, what are its beliefs - and how is it related to
the transition from an industrial to an information-age economy?
 Which (if either) American political party is best positioned
to represent it?  And, what impact will it have on the 1996 presidential
election?</I>
<P>
<h3><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h3>
<B>by <a href="#webe">Vin Weber </a></B>
<P>
Along with the United States itself, America's key allies are
transforming themselves away from the industrial age that has
dominated the past century just as surely as they moved away from
the agrarian age in an earlier time.  While the outlines of the
new era are yet to be determined, we know that it will be overwhelmingly
influenced by the information technology that is now upon us -
every day we hear something new about the Internet, Cyberspace
and virtuality.
<P>
The private sector has been learning the lessons of the new age
for more than a decade. General Motors, IBM and AT&amp;T have
learned that bureaucratic, centralized organizations must be replaced
because success in the information age demands decentralization
and empowerment.  Government too must remake itself for a new
age.  The idea that programs run by a bureaucracy concentrated
in Washington, D.C. is the preferred method for addressing the
nation's problems is no longer tenable.
<P>
As the people remake government for the 21st century, three major
trends become clear: devolution, diffusion and connection. Devolution
is sending power and responsibility to the lowest level possible
for effective decision-making.  Shifting from Federal to state
or local control is just a trickle today. Diffusion is relying
on non-governmental organizations or individuals to perform many
of the functions government usurped during the industrial era.
 The use of vouchers, privatization, voluntary organizations,
charities and churches are among the tools of diffusion. The final
trend is connection. This has less to do with government than
with individuals. We must return to the sense of community we
once had.  The most important people are those closest to you.
You must want to help - and feel a responsibility for -  yourself,
your family, your friends and your neighbors.
<P>
Remaking government in such a manner is indeed a democratic revolution.
 Often times it appears that the leaders of such a revolution
are radicals, acting alone in the woods.  Yet if we look around
the world, we see that different cultures and political traditions
are facing basically the same set of facts as they too make the
transition to the information age. In bringing together the leading
agents of political change in America, Great Britain, Japan and
Canada, we found that to a remarkable degree their ideas reinforce
each other.  In their own way and working within their own political
traditions, they describe similar goals for achieving the best
form of government for the information age.
<P>
These leaders also demonstrate how important correct political
management is.  The degree of change required in government organization
is so great that delaying it, stifling it or trying to stop it
will only hurt citizens.  Yet in America, President Clinton has
adopted the rhetoric - &quot;the era of big government is over&quot;
- while actually governing in the opposite manner.  In Britain,
the democratic revolution is at risk by the Tory Prime Minister.
And in Canada, the Conservatives went from governing the country
to having only two seats in the Parliament after they failed to
offer the correct policies of progress.
<P>
As Americans debate the proper role of government in the 21st
century, it is important for them to see models of success and
failure.  By bringing together four remarkable leaders, we hope
to discover some lessons ourselves.
<P>
<h3><a name="age">The Age of New Realities</a></h3>
<B>by <a href="#ging">Newt Gingrich </a></B>
<P></a>
In thinking through what is similar that is driving Canada, Britain,
Japan and America, I think there are three large realities that
will shape everything else we're doing for a very long time.
<P>
The first is the world market.  The world market is going to impose
continuing pressure for competitive modification.  All of the
western democracies - and here I will include Japan as a western
democracy - are faced with the same challenge: how to become dramatically
more productive as societies in order to compete in a 21st century
market in which China and other countries such as Thailand, Pakistan
and India will be playing more and more competitive roles.   This
goes much beyond manufacturing, into the whole question of education,
of tax codes and of entrepreneurship.  The Europeans, frankly,
have been less successful at such adaptation, which is reflected
in very high unemployment rates.  Yet the world market will apply
continuing pressure, and America and Japan are going to face that
pressure fully as much as the Europeans.  
<P>
The second reality is the rise of the information age.  Alvin
and Heidi Tofler describe it as the Third Wave, and it is at least
comparable to the rise of the industrial world that Adam Smith
was writing about in the late 18th Century. It is a change so
large that it will force us to rethink everything we're doing.
 The degree to which we can do that in an open, positive, conscious
way will be dramatically better than if we just stumble into it.
The rise of an information age or of a Third Wave civilization
is going to affect every society on the planet, and I think all
of us have to get used to that and have to figure out therefore
what is it we're doing.  For instance, a new species was recently
discovered in Laos in the national park.  National parks are a
19th century American invention that have rapidly spread across
the planet.  They are an example of what happens as you go through
this kind of modification. All of us are going to find ways to
deal with the information age; they're going to turn out to be
remarkably similar over time, but those societies which are on
the cutting edge will have higher incomes and greater choices.
 Those societies which resist the information age will have lower
incomes and fewer choices.
<P>
The third thing challenging all of us is an expanding definition
of human.  If you go back to the 18th century, basically propertied
white males counted and everybody else was relatively less important.
Yet over the last 200 years, we've had a continually expanding
sense of what does it mean to be human.  As we get to a point
of including everybody and deciding that we're prepared to spend
resources to include them, we're going to be challenged with a
greater and greater intensity to deal with the question, how do
we include everyone to the fullest of their ability and how do
we compensate for those who might have been genetically or otherwise
disadvantaged?  
<P>
Those three factors, the world market, the information age and
the expanding definition of being human, are realities for all
societies and particularly for all democratic societies.  There
are also three facts that industrial societies in particular face.
<P>
The first fact is the failure of state central planning. The collapse
of the Soviet Empire demonstrated this most clearly.  Many of
our friends on the left bitterly regret that it failed and prefer
to ignore its demise.  The Clinton Administration is the last
stand in this country of a genuine belief that centralized planning
makes sense. But the fact is it just failed.  
<P>
The second fact is the failure of secular bureaucracy.  It turns
out that as ways of saving human beings, secular bureaucrats are
among the least successful.  We need to say that more often. 
For example, when our President talks about investing in education,
we should first say, all right, if you're spending $9,000 per
child in Washington, D.C., maybe the problem isn't money.  But
we're not willing to be blunt enough and tough enough about the
obvious failure of secular bureaucracy as a delivery system for
dramatically improving human beings.
<P>
The third fact is the failure of emphasizing redistribution over
production of wealth.  Going back in some ways to 19th century
French socialism, there has been a fascination with redistribution
of wealth, particularly by those who don't produce well.  Emphasized
by the news media and the academic classes - both of whom believe
it's wonderful to spend somebody else's money - the result has
been a focus for the last 70 years on the notion that if only
we accepted the finite limit of wealth and then redistributed
it, everybody would be better off.
<P>
In truth, the objective, historic, long-term fact is that societies
that focus on creating wealth outstrip societies that focus on
redistribution in improving the lot of the poorest people.  That's
an objective fact historically.  Societies that focus on getting
rich bring everybody up at a dramatically faster rate than societies
that focus on redistribution. In fact, if you try to raise the
bottom in a static model you rapidly get resistance from everybody
else, because, by definition in a static model, only achieving
it not by sharing the new wealth, which people are rather comfortable
doing, but by taking away from people what they already have.
<P>
Thus my core critique of the left as I think it is emerging in
the late 20th century is that: first, the state central planners
have failed; second, secular bureaucracies don't transform people;
and third, emphasizing redistribution is a dead loser in helping
the poor compared to focusing on the production of wealth.  This
leads me to seven principles that may be peculiarly an American
formulation.
<P>
First, that there's a spiritual basis of freedom.  There's a reason
that the Founding Fathers said we're endowed by our Creator. 
In fact, being human is a spiritual, not a biological fact, and
may be the most important thing that distinguishes us from purely
biological organisms.  If you don't have a system that says there's
a spiritual basis for being human, you have only a lawyer's definition
of human rights and that's a very shallow framework.  
<P>
Second is that we believe in the power of technological advance
to increase the potential for human goals. You get a better environment
over time and a better approach to helping the poor with a higher
technology society rather than with a Luddite approach. The truth
is that if you go back to the beginning of the Neolithic period,
over time and as a general principle, more technology is better
than less.  On balance technology tends to be used more for good
even though it can also produce gun powder and atomic weapons.
 
<P>
Third, the power of the entrepreneur and the free market to create
wealth is extraordinary.  Whenever possible it needs to be optimized.
 Entrepreneurs and the free market are likely to create more wealth
for more people and therefore over time actually improve a lot
of the poor better than either redistribution or secular bureaucracies.
 
<P>
Fourth is the importance of the individual and families.  That
is the core argument for tax cuts: who spends your money better,
you or a secular bureaucracy? We don't emphasize the moral content
behind tax cuts enough.  This is a moral fight.  Should you have
the right to your resources or should somebody you've never met
have the right to your resources, and if so, what's their claim?
 Why should they have the right to take from you? Yet we lack
the courage because we are still in a leftist world in which we
believe the money belongs to the government and who are we to
give you back your own money.  I think we need to be much more
aggressive and much more assertive in saying there's a moral basis
for tax cuts.  It's called individual freedom and the right of
families to spend their own money.  
<P>
Fifth is the power of volunteerism, which is in many ways a peculiarly
American contribution to the modern world.  Best described by
de Tocqueville, it is another argument for lower taxes.  How can
you be a volunteer if you're indentured to the state? If we want
more volunteerism, we need to leave more resources with those
who would volunteer.  It's a moral cause that requires we ask:
which does a better job of helping people, secular bureaucracies
or the variety of volunteer methods of reaching out?  
<P>
Sixth is the importance of appropriate government.  I am not an
extreme Libertarian.  I in fact believe there are many things
we want the government to do - protect our borders, stop the drug
trade, insure public health.  I'd like to make sure, for example,
that we don't go back to having yellow fever or malaria on a grand
basis.  These are not small things.  It is a very strong government
that can defend its borders, stop epidemics and maintain an honest
dollar.  I am for a strong government, but I'm for an appropriate
government. That means minimum bureaucracy, maximum free enterprise
and a tax code which encourages volunteerism and encourages families.
 
<P>
Lastly is the importance of language and grammar.  It goes back
in a sense to Orwell's argument in the <I>Politics in the English
Language,</I> which is an essay that every would-be revolutionary
should read.  The fact is that the left steals our language. 
The left defends the most grotesque destruction of human beings
in the modern social state by arguing that we would be cruel to
the poor by liberating them from the very shackles which the leftists
fasten on them.  I can imagine nothing worse for an American child
than subjecting them to the welfare system of Washington, D.C.,
and it's not for lack of money.  It is because the system is inherently
destructive of human beings. I can imagine nothing more liberating
for the children of Washington than to abolish their schools tomorrow
morning and replace them with a scholarship for every child of
$9,000 and allowing them to go to any school that wants to charge
them and actually teach them how to read and write.  
<P>
<h3><a name="rev">The Conservative Revolution</a></h3>
<B>by <a href="#redw">John Redwood </a></B>
<P>
With so many conservatives meeting to discuss revolution, it's
as if Edmund Burke could turn up at the Communist International.
 Should I be meeting like this with all of you with such an agenda?
 Yes, of course I should and we should, for only those who recognize
the revolutionary power of change as we hurtle toward the next
millennium have a chance of seizing the democratic mandate and
of conserving what is best in our traditions.
<P>
It was not we conservatives, after all, who unleashed the dynamic
hurricane of the third industrial revolution, nor was it western
conservatives who carried a keynote to government in the Philippines,
took to the streets in Romania and swept aside the Communists
or who tore down the blocks in the Berlin Wall hand by hand. 
It was the force of the people themselves in all their infinite
ingenuity and their diversity.  It was we conservatives who stood
firm for the principles and truths which now inspire so many around
the world, the truths of free trade, freedom under the law, of
one man, one vote.  We owe President Reagan and Prime Minister
Thatcher a debt of gratitude for standing up to the mighty U.S.S.R.
and precipitating its collapse from within while the Liberals
would have none of it, and if they had had none of it, we would
live in a much less interesting world.  
<P>
The mighty forces of change have given us hope for a better world,
a world free of Communist tyranny, a world where more look to
the ballot box to resolve their differences, a world where more
can hope to enjoy the fruits of global capitalism.  Never have
so many looked forward to such riches before.  
<P>
But those same forces have generated great feelings of insecurity
in western electorates.  So fast is change that people fear for
their own jobs.  Where will I be working next year they ask. 
What new things must I learn to carry on working?  Will I have
a job at all?  In the United States and the United Kingdom, fears
about jobs are allied to worries about the stability of the traditional
family.  All too many children will go to bed tonight in New York
or in London in a home with no father.  All too many children
are born into a home which has never known the presence of a father.
 And all too many modern marriages are straining to breaking point.
 
<P>
In such a world, voters look to politicians not just to lead a
revolution, but to reassure.  They want us to waive magic wands
to remove the uncertainties.  They see a bloated public sector
that is arrogated itself men, money and management in a stunning
array of powers, services and agencies.  They expect such a colossus
to help and protect them, but all too often they are bitterly
disappointed.  
<P>
Free schooling may be provided but some children fall further
and further behind because they are not well taught.  Free health
care is provided but only sometimes if you're prepared to queue
and wait a year.  Each subsidy in government intervention fails
to stop redundancies.  Incomes are taxed ever more highly to meet
the unsatiable demands of the expanding state.  The numbers on
welfare grow as more miss out on the technological roller coaster.
 
<P>
It was that American, John Kenneth Galbraith, who complained of
private affluence and public squalor as he rallied a former generation
to a program of more government.  Today we are running the risk
of private squalor and public affluence.  We have certainly reached
in many western societies public waste and enforced private prudence.
 The take home pay of government and the numbers on its payroll
has far expanded far more rapidly than that of most others.  
<P>
People feel let down by many traditional politicians.  As government
has grown, there has been a wish to hold office but shuffle off
responsibility.  In Europe, the European Commission is never to
blame for anything.  When something goes wrong, it seeks others
to be scapegoats.  Many politicians now wish to make elections
matters of image and presentation rather than of substance.  The
sound bite rules the airways even though it may not come from
the heart of he who uttered it and rarely comes from his pen.
 As a result, the people, the electors, come to fell manipulated,
cheapened or cheated.  
<P>
Conservatives must never lose faith in the people, and we must
never lose the faith of the people.  We must look them in the
eye and we must tell them the truth.  Spin doctors should not
be paid to lie, for that way only breeds mistrust.  I believe
a conservative revival is not only possible but vital to the continued
prosperity, discipline and success of advanced societies.  Newt
Gingrich has shown how quickly people will return to our colors
if they are held high and if the army is given a sense of direction.
 For the army to march, for the conservative's recruiting sergeant
to flourish, it needs clear principles, a record of success, a
strategic as well as a tactical purpose.  Only a conservative
agenda can today deliver this.
<P>
The first task of conservatives is to conquer government itself,
to gain some control over the scale and complexity of modern administration.
 Government has to be brought to answer and to bow to the court
of the people.  
<P>
The second task is to cut taxes as the cost of government come
down.  Advanced countries cannot compete with the developing world
if their tills are raided too often by the tax gatherer.
<P>
The third task is to remove obstacles to business success.  We
need freedom from too many rules and regulations so that enterprise
has a chance. Fourth is to ensure that the tax, benefit and legal
systems put families first, buttressing them rather than undermining
them.
<P>
The fifth task is to promote global trade and welcome the third
industrial revolution.  It will generate many more jobs.  It makes
working from home possible.  It could empower the house bound,
liberate the busy, even enliven the bored.  It is more opportunity
than threat.
<P>
Finally, the sixth task is to be true conservatives in protecting
and embellishing all that is best in our different inheritances.
 For Britain, that means the English language, our ancient and
modern noisy democracy, and our great institutions from Oxford
University to Botts Hospital now 900 years young.  For the United
States, that means living up to the sonorous words of Washington,
Jefferson and Lincoln on the rights of man and the pursuit of
happiness.  And for Canada, that means keeping together their
special federation and preserving Canadian identity, for a sense
of belonging matters more today than ever.    
<P>
As conservatives who understand the third industrial revolution,
we are not promising people an end to commercial change.  We cannot
and will not stand like some modern King Kanute and demand that
the software recedes.  We must embrace technological change and
free our people to prosper from it.  But to reassure them, we
must keep alive the flames of our own unique constitutions.  We
must remind people why they belong to families and communities
as well as to the global marketplace.  They gain their security
from the one and their prosperity from the other.  
<P>
Many of you must remind Americans why they should be proud of
America from sea to shining sea.  I must remind my fellow countrymen
why we should be proud to be British with the mother of parliaments
and mother of the free.
<P>
<h3><a name="japan">The Japanese Restoration</a></h3>
<P>
<B>by <a href="#mats">Iwao Matsuda </a></B>
<P>
Revolution is not a word that we Japanese like to use with regard
to our country.  In 1868, when a dynamic group of young reformers
took over the government, abolished feudalism and created the
political, economic and educational institutions of a modern nation
state, they chose the word restoration, not revolution, to describe
what they were doing.  History calls their achievement the Meji
Restoration.  
<P>
Today, when once again Japan needs top to bottom changes in its
political, economic, educational and social institutions, the
key word is reform rather than revolution.  Yet clearly the changes
that Japan requires are revolutionary.  If our program succeeds,
we will have brought about a revolution that will complete what
began with the Meji reformers more than 100 years ago.  It will
embody the most far reaching changes that our country has ever
known and enable us to join the ranks of  the world's normal democratic
states.  
<P>
What is a normal democratic state?  It is first of all a democracy.
 What we have in Japan today is democracy a la Japanese.  We have
the institutional forms of parliamentary government but the circumstance
is rather different from what is regarded as normal in American
and European democracies.  Ours is based on consensus politics
and a mentality that tends to exclude outsiders.  The goal of
the New Frontier Party is to bring about in government alteration
between two political parties that will compete with each other
on the basis of policy, not factions or personalities.  
<P>
For almost the entire post-war period, a single party - the Liberal
Democrats - held exclusive power.  Their monopoly was broken in
July 1993, when a group of reform minded Liberal Democrats rebelled
against the party leadership and established a new party.  I was
one of those Liberals.  Together with other opposition parties,
we won the general election and established a coalition government.
 Yet soon the Liberal Democrats made a deal with their sworn enemies,
the Socialists, and returned to power.  
<P>
To oppose what we regarded as this unholy alliance, all major
opposition parties except the Communists came together in December
1994 to establish the New Frontier Party.  Today, at least in
form, we have the beginning of a two party system.  On one side
stands the government, a coalition of Liberal Democrats, Socialists
and a minor party.  What holds this coalition together?  In my
view, it is a common desire to enjoy the perks  of government
power.  They mouth the slogans of reform but in fact they want
to keep their vested interests.
<P>
By contrast, the New Frontier Party is dedicated to the cause
of change.  We call for wide-ranging changes in politics, in the
economy, in education, in society.  In politics, we were partially
successful during our brief one year in power.  We changed the
election system from one of modified-seat election district to
one which has 300 single-seat constituencies and 200 proportional-representation
seats.  The first election under this system will be held sometime
before the summer of 1997.  It may not immediately bring about
a permanent two party system, but we are convinced that over time
minor parties will fade away.  The present Socialist Party will
be the top candidate for extinction.
<P>
The New Frontier Party's platform calls for clear choices in politics.
 We want to end government by bureaucracy and bring about government
by the people's elected legislators.  We will reduce the number
of ministries from 20 today to 15 after we come to power, and
we will have legislators taking a much more active load in their
ministry.
<P>
Our partnership with the United States is primary (of course with
Canada and England also).  The Cold War has ended but East Asia
remains a dangerous and uncertain place.  China is a huge question
mark, but more unpredictable and therefore more dangerous is North
Korea.  Asia needs the American security presence.  Yet the Japan
we want is one where we assume a much more active partnership
than the existing government.  We will raise our voice louder.
 We may not always agree with the United States, but we will never
forget that we are allies.  We want a permanent seat on the United
Nations Security Council, and we pledge to play a leading role
in its affairs.  The United Nations is far from perfect, but it
is the only international forum we have, and we want to be active
to make it better.  We will not shy away from peace keeping duties.
<P>
At home, we want small government at the center and more power
devolved to local entities. We will have about 300 local authorities
nationwide, small enough to be close to the borders, large enough
to carry out effective government, for which we will replace the
present hodgepodge of 47 prefects and more than 3,200 cities,
towns and villages.
<P>
In the economy, the principal weapon for reform will be deregulation.
 We have no illusions about the difficulty of our task.  Japan
has been a regulated society for more than 1,000 years.  We have
a lot of people, little land, and few natural resources for everyone
to share in an economy of scarcity.  There have to be regulations
and on whole people have accepted these regulations.  In modern
times, the concept of fairness, of equality, has taken precedence
over the concept of individual freedom.  We are a society without
large gaps between rich and poor, management and it's workers.
 We would like to keep it so, but not at the cost of stifling
individual freedom and individual initiative.  We want to experience
the kind of wave that has lifted the American economy and keeps
it far ahead of the others.  That is a wave that does not depend
upon manufacturing production. We need better ideas.  We need
better information.  We need to know how to put information to
work in a more efficient way for each one of us.  In short, we
need freedom.
<P>
I say this is a difficult task because most of us recognize the
need for change.  Many are afraid of living in a society with
few regulations, in a society where each individual will have
to be more self-reliant and take greater responsibility for his
own actions.  Nevertheless, there's no other way for Japan to
move into the 21st century and survive unless people become convinced
that the only alternative to deregulation is continued decline
and eventual extinction.
<P>
Educational reform may be the most important of the reforms we
propose.  Universal education involves one of the great achievements
of the Meji reformers.  Japan today is one of the world's most
literate nations, but our education remains in the 19th Century.
 It emphasizes rote line, stuffing the student with all sorts
of relevant and irrelevant information which he can regurgitate
in written examinations.  We need education that will foster self-reliance
and individual creativity.  The primary emphasis must be allowing
the individual to develop.  Education is an area which we may
not see results for 10 years or more, but we must begin now for
we are already far behind the leaders in this field.  
<P>
Underlying all these reforms is a need for a change in society
itself. How do we move from decisions by consensus into the essence
of democracy?  This is a making by the majority.  Ultimately,
we can only achieve our goals by a revolution within each individual
consciousness.  That takes time, but that is a task to which we
have dictated ourselves.
<P>
<h3><a name="three">The Three Revolutions</a></h3>
<P>
<B>by <a href="#mann">Preston Manning </a></B>
<P>
Our subject is a world in revolution.  Reformation might be the
gentler word.  Perhaps we can talk about revolution through reformation;
that's the Canadian way of seeking the middle. I begin by asking,
which revolution are we talking about? I ask this because it seems
to me there are several revolutions going on in the world at the
same time, and it is important to distinguish them and to think
through the relationship between them.  
<P>
The first revolution is the conservative revolution, the rejection
of Socialism, of liberal interventionism, of the ideology of the
master state in favor of market based solutions to economic problems,
of more personal responsibility for social security, balanced
budgets and limited governments. Examples, of course, of this
revolution are the factory example in Great Britain and the Contract
with America, a program of the new Republicans here in Washington.
 
<P>
In my country, Canada, this conservative revolution is also in
progress, but proceeding more slowly and sporadically, which is
the Canadian way.  We start, of course, with revolution; is it
a provincial or federal responsibility? At the provincial level
it is being led by conservative parties in the Province of Alberta
and the Province of Ontario, but at the national level the federal
Conservative Party has virtually disappeared.  Therefore, at the
national level the conservative revolution is being managed or
mismanaged by a pragmatic liberal administration that is not at
all enthusiastic about leading such a revolution but is being
pushed along by a third party, namely, the Reform Party.  If all
of this sounds confusing, it is, but it arises from the fact that
we Canadians are extreme moderates and tend to protect ourselves
from the excesses of revolutions by entrusting their management
to people who do not believe in them.  
<P>
So that's a synopsis of the conservative revolution that is in
progress in our country, but there is another revolution which
is going on in the world at the same time. There have been allusions
to it by other speakers, and this I will refer to as the structural
revolution, and in my country, this revolution is as pronounced
as the conservative revolution.  
<P>
The structural revolution has two conflicting components.  On
the one hand it is characterized by the removal of the internal
and external barriers to trade, the aggregation of local and provincial
economies into national economies, and then the aggregation of
those national economies and identities into larger global structures
like the North American Free Trade Area, the European Union or
the Asia Pacific Economic Community.  At the same time that the
aggregation into bigger and bigger units is going on, of course,
more and more people and more and more countries want to affirm
and exercise more local and personal control over social services
and cultural policies that directly affect the quality of their
own lives and their cultural and personal identities.  Thus, in
that respect, they identify more with smaller and more homogeneous
units of political organization - local governments and communities
- based often on regional or racial or linguistic or cultural
distinctiveness.  
<P>
In Canada, therefore, at the same time that our national economy
is being integrated into the North American global economy, this
structural revolution manifests itself in the form of regional
alienation in western Canada, Quebec separatism, talk of maritime
union in our atlantic provinces, provincial premiers demanding
more decentralization of federal power, and large municipalities
contemplating city-state status.  In other words, the ground behind
Canada, and I'd suggest many other countries, is moving in two
different directions, like the big crustal plates that geologists
tell us are the cause of earthquakes.
<P>
The challenge of governments includes the challenge of designing
structures capable of absorbing those stresses and strains. Five
years ago, the alignment of political parties in the Canadian
Parliament that could have been described on the traditional left-right-center
axis. Today it could be just as well described as consisting of
traditional federalists - mainly liberals - defending the old
nation-state structure, separatists from Quebec seeking extreme
devolution, and new federalists - reformers - seeking to create
the more flexible federal state that can handle both of these
forces in the 21st century.  
<P>
Perhaps both the conservative revolution and the structural revolution
are simply aspects of a broader revolution, the democratic revolution.
 For me it is this democratic revolution which is the ultimate
revolution and which should end up being the distinguishing revolution
of our times.  All over the world, ordinary people are seeking
to get more control in their own hands or in the hands of institutions
they can influence over the facts that most directly affect the
quality and content of their lives.  Thus they will support the
conservative revolution to the extent that it limits the spending
and taxing powers of governments and leaves more dollars in the
pockets of citizens, if this is done equitably.  They will support
the conservative revolution to the extent that it redresses the
intrusiveness of the liberal, social policy state, provided the
old intrusions are not replaced by new intrusions.
<P>
Public support for the structural revolution, for enlarging markets
to stimulate economic growth, to create better jobs for people
with higher incomes, and public support for strengthening the
power of local government at the expense of larger and more distant
governments, is also it seems to me a manifestation of this broader
democratic revolution. If those larger and more distant governments
necessary to manage our national and international affairs are
to retain their legitimacy, they must take steps both to facilitate
a new division of powers between themselves and the lower levels
of government and they themselves must become more democratic,
more representative, more accountable and more responsive to the
people that they serve.
<P>
I am personally supportive of the general direction of the conservative
revolution and the structural revolution, but I believe that their
success or failure will ultimately be measured by the extent to
which they serve the cause of the democratic revolution, a democratic
revolution which I suggest is happening in Canada and virtually
every other country in the world.

<h2>AmeriCorps</h2>
<b>Testimony by Arianna Huffington <br>
To<br> The Subcommittee On Oversight And Investigations<p>
</b><p>
OCTOBER 17, 1995<P>
Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank you and the members of the subcommittee for inviting me to testify today.  I wish to speak about the difference between true volunteerism and paid "volunteerism," between the effective compassion that can come only from individuals, and the compulsory compassion of the bureaucratic welfare state.  I think that this is an important distinction to make, particularly here in Washington.  After all, only in Washington could you find someone who could miss the irony of paying someone for so-called "volunteer" work.  But I imagine you've heard a lot about that today.
<P>
I also wish to speak about the work we are doing at the Center for Effective Compassion that I have co-founded with Professor Marvin Olasky, and of the work that hundreds of  thousands of Americans are doing around the country everyday to help those most in need.   It is my unequivocal conclusion that Americorps, both as a reality and as a symbol, is hurting the work that has to be done if we are to solve the major social problems facing us.  It's hurting in three fundamental ways:
<P><OL>
<LI>It contradicts the basic religious and philosophical teachings about human nature, according to which human beings have an instinctive propensity to reach out and  help others.  This instinct -- which, in my latest book, I call the fourth instinct -- is competing with other, more self-interested instincts, but as a culture we need to do everything we can to strengthen the instinct that makes us part of a healthy community.  Americorps, by paying people to "volunteer" -- by paying them to do what should be done naturally as part of our learning to live and care for each other in society -- undermines that most important instinct in human beings.  
<LI>Americorps, in its small but significant way, like Great Society programs, in their all-pervasive way, cheats people out of the character-building rewards of giving.  We build up our moral muscle by exercising it.  We become virtuous by the practice of virtue, responsible by the practice of responsibility, generous by the practice of generosity, and compassionate by the practice of compassion.  And all these traits are being practiced because that's how we become fully human, not because we are being paid to practice them. 
<LI>The third, and most immediate, way Americorps undermines the practice of true, effective compassion is by standing in sharp contrast to the hard, unpaid, true volunteer work being done everyday in the trenches around America. What hundreds of thousands of people are doing everyday, Mr. Chairman, is rolling up their sleeves and actually helping to feed, to clothe, and to turn lives around. There was a very moving documentary on PBS last week about little-known, community-based groups working hard at tackling social problems in Anacostia.  How many of these groups are using Americorps volunteers?  Mr. Chairman, if these people were depending on  paid "volunteers" to keep going, they would have closed down long ago.</ol>
<P>Helping those in need is a moral imperative.  It is our responsibility -- our obligation -- and in a completely different realm from getting loans to go to school or money to live on.  These are all important necessities, but when we mix the two together, and, most important, when the mixing is done by the government at taxpayers' expense, something very important is lost -- both for the building of individual character and for the building of healthy communities. 
<P>The people I most admire in this world are volunteering their time everyday without the benefit of any fancy, bureaucratically-run programs.  Not too far from the Capitol, Mr. Chairman, there is Hannah Hawkins, a feisty, no-nonsense lady who runs an after-school program in Anacostia called Children of Mine.  Hannah serves hot meals to kids.  But she gives them much more than that.  She gives them the love and attention that many of them have never received at home.  She also gives them an important gift that government would never give -- Bible lessons, which teach them the difference between right and wrong, and which bring hope and meaning to their lives.  
<P>Also not too far from here are Marsh Ward and Julia Lightfoot, who run 
Clean and Sober Streets,  a safe harbor for drug and alcohol addicts who are trying to put their lives back together.  They give addicts the sort of attention and caring that they have not received before, particularly from government-run institutions
<P>In Denver, there is  Bob Cote, who runs a program called Step 13 in which he tries to help addicts turn their lives around.  Bob, a former addict himself, refers to the government-run programs as "suicide on the installment plan."  Bob's program houses 100 men a night; they are allowed to stay as long as they need to -- as long as they follow the rules, which include doing some kind of work each day as well as staying sober.  Bob's operation costs $300,000 a year, with no help from the government.  Bob estimates that if he were to do what he does now but with government money, it would cost more than $2 million because of all the absurd rules and regulations.  And that doesn't even count for having to pay for volunteers.
<P>In San Antonio, there is the Rev. Freddy Garcia, who runs a program called Victory Outreach, a combination church and halfway house for recovering addicts.  Rev. Garcia's success rate in getting people cleaned up and back on their feet is more than 60 percent.  Recently, the Texas Drug and Alcohol Commission asked Rev. Garcia to stop referring to his work as "drug rehabilitation" because he wasn't conforming with their regulations.
<P>And I could go on and on, Mr. Chairman. You probably haven't seen or heard of any of these people.  And  there's a simple explanation for this, Mr. Chairman: they aren't walking the corridors of Congress asking for government funds to sustain their programs.  And they most certainly do not believe that the best way to help the poor is to convince the government to help them.  Americorps is an affront to the people I mentioned and it is also a hindrance to the work Marvin Olasky and I are doing at the Center for Effective Compassion.  Our aim is nothing less than the transformation of America's efforts to aid those in need, from a bureaucratic, government-centered approach to a community-oriented, people-centered approach. 
<P>We have found plenty of inspiration for our work in American history, going back to the Pilgrims.  When the Pilgrims needed help to survive their first winter at Plymouth Colony, the Indians didn't simply give them a hand-out -- they gave them a hand-up.  Squanto taught them how to plant their corn successfully in New England's difficult soil.
<P>Squanto's act of effective compassion is the origin of Thanksgiving.  The hand-up made a huge difference.  The Indians didn't just run a soup kitchen or donate food to their neighbors; but too often that is what we do today.  The hand-out stems hunger for a while -- the hand-up banishes it forever. 
<P>I do not mean to diminish the effort or goodwill of Americans who will volunteer their time on food lines or organize food drives this Thanksgiving.  They are making a difference and brightening the holiday for many.  But what is needed is their involvement in making a lasting difference, as Squanto did with the Pilgrims.  
<P>Through a national campaign we are launching during Thanksgiving week, we hope to challenge some of our long-held assumptions regarding giving. Our message is simple: For compassion to be effective, it must be personal, challenging, and spiritual.  It does not involve government, and it most certainly does not involve payment for what is a natural duty and responsibility that we need to nurture from the time our children are very young.  I don't want my daughters when they are teenagers to say to me: "Why should I volunteer for free, Mom?  Dick and Jane are getting paid for it!"

<CENTER><B>Comments by  Foundation President Jeff Eisenach  on ABC's Nightline</B><BR>

<P>
<p>
"The United States is unambiguously still today, thank goodness, the leader in medical technology but that intelligence, that human capital is literally getting on an airplane and flying to Europe and setting up shop and setting up households in Europe.<p><p>

"We simply think the process should be decentralized, that much of the work should be moved out of the hands of government bureaucracies into efficient private sector agencies.  But the same level of safety and efficiency ought to be demanded  both by the private sector companies that are doing the certification and also the FDA and in its final approval.<p><p>

Dr. Eisenach was also quoted in the Wall Street Journal on this subject:  "The FDA, instead of being a 'certifier of products' would become a 'certifier of certifiers,' ensuring that the private entities uphold the agency's standards, he said."

<h2><center>Hearings on Regulatory Policy</h2>
before the U.S. House of Representatives, Subcommittee on Technology, Committee on Science<p></center></h3>
<b>Statement of Thomas M. Lenard<br>
Senior Fellow and Director of Regulatory Studies,The Progress & Freedom Foundation</b><p>
September 28, 1995<P>
Madame Chairwoman and Members of the Subcommittee, I appreciate the opportunity to participate in these hearings, which address an extremely important set of issues.  Innovation and technical progress are the means by which our nation's overall economic welfare and living standards are improved.  We must therefore try to assure that government programs enacted for a variety of different purposes do not create disincentives to the development and adoption of new technologies.<P>
	Regulatory programs come in different sizes and shapes.  Since necessity is the mother of invention, some of these programs undoubtedly stimulate the development of technologies needed to satisfy specific regulatory requirements.  Overall, however, the effect of regulation on innovation is probably adverse.  In particular, there are major regulatory programs affecting high-technology sectors of the economy that clearly discourage and delay the introduction of important new innovations of great potential benefit to consumers.  These effects are frequently difficult to quantify.  The cost of a new technology delivered to consumers several years later than it should be, for example, may not be readily apparent.  Even more difficult to discern are the costs of innovations that never are made because development costs artificially have been driven too high.  The best recent estimate of the total cost of federal regulation, due to Professor Thomas Hopkins of the Rochester Institute of Technology, is about $600 billion annually or $6,000 per American household.  Yet this figure does not reflect the adverse effects on innovation of the regulatory programs I discuss below.<P>
	These programs span the regulatory landscape from traditional "economic" regulatory programs, aimed at pricing and entry conditions, to programs intended to protect the public's health and safety.  Their common characteristics are:<P>
they require an approval or license from a regulator for a new product or service to be introduced; and, 
they affect very innovative sectors of the economy.<P>
	Granting regulatory agencies product-approval authority tends to increase the costs of innovation and delay the introduction of new technologies, because the incentives faced by the agencies are generally not conducive to rapid approval.  The burden of proof is typically on the applicant to show that his product is consistent with the public interest, however defined in the relevant statute.  This can be an expensive proposition and regulators frequently raise the costs by requesting additional data on which to base their decision.  Moreover, once such a framework is in place, it can be used by incumbents to raise the cost of entry to new competitors.<P>
	My testimony focuses on the relationship between innovation and regulation in the biomedical and telecommunications sectors of the economy.  The revolutionary developments in biotechnology and computing have had a profound impact on these sectors.  These sectors are heavily regulated, however, and this is slowing the innovative process appreciably.         
<P>
Medical Innovation
<P>
	The discovery and development of pharmaceuticals and medical devices is a time-consuming, uncertain process that requires years of expensive laboratory work, pre-clinical and, ultimately, clinical testing.  It now takes approximately 15 years to bring a drug to the market, at an average cost that has been estimated at close to $400 million.  Many years of costs are incurred before there is even a slight chance of patients receiving new products and of companies earning returns on their investment.  This is of special significance for start-up companies, such as the many small biotechnology and device firms which have no products bringing in revenue while they invest heavily in researching new products. 
	<P>The current regulatory framework for new medical products requires that sponsors of new drugs or medical devices apply to the Food and Drug Administration for marketing approval, submitting data on the safety and effectiveness of their products.1  The only route to the market is through the FDA.	<P>The effects on innovation in the drug and device industries of delegating the approval process to a risk-averse agency operating in a political environment are exactly what we might expect.  The return to research has fallen and become more uncertain, resulting in less domestic product development.  We also observe "approval arbitrage," whereby companies concentrate their R&D efforts overseas where the regulatory burden is less onerous.  The high regulatory costs and increased uncertainty also deter new entrants into the drug and device industries, reducing the pool of capital available for funding new research.  Ultimately, the system as now configured deprives patients of life-saving and life-enhancing products that never come to market because the overall costs of innovation have been driven too high: <P>  
Despite skyrocketing research and development budgets in the biomedical industries, there has been no corresponding increase in the flow of new drugs and medical devices to the market.  The industry's research spending, after adjusting for inflation, is ten times the level it was in the early 1960s.  Yet, the output of approved new molecular entities has not increased since enactment of the Kefauver-Harris Amendments of 1962 and remains far below the pre-1962 level.<P>
The time required to bring a new drug to market, including pre-clinical testing, clinical development and regulatory review has increased from a little more than six years in the mid-1960s to about 15 years in the early 1990s.<P>
In the medical device area, the number of premarket approval applications decreased from 78 in 1990 to 40 in 1993, while the time for approval increased from 609 to 823 days.<P>
Medical device companies increasingly are locating research and manufacturing facilities offshore solely because of the regulatory burdens associated with entering the market here.<P>
	These are all sobering facts, in the face of the large increases in research budgets and the availability of totally new sciences, such as biotechnology and powerful computing, since the early 1960s.  Americans obtain access to fewer new drugs and devices and receive them later than they should.  America's procedures for bringing new products to patients are among the slowest and most expensive in the developed world, and it is now routine for new drugs and devices developed by American companies to be available in other countries before they become available here.<P>
	The FDA's adverse effect on innovation extends to foods, where it also has jurisdiction and where food additives are subject to a similar premarket approval process.  For over twenty years, the FDA has been deciding what to do with the fat substitute olestra that has been found in clinical studies to reduce overall fat intake and to be harmless.2  The fact that the manufacturer of this product has spent upwards of $100 million before making a single sale has surely not gone unnoticed by others contemplating similar R&D efforts.    <P>

Biotechnology
<P>
	While the influence of the FDA on biotechnology products is obviously strong, these products are also held hostage in other regulatory arenas.  Biotechnology holds great promise for the development of more environmentally benign pesticides and more effective bioremediation techniques.  Yet, the Environmental Protection Agency's regulatory approach to the testing and approval of these agricultural and other biotech products is discouraging their development, as has been pointed out by Dr. Henry Miller, former head of the FDA's biotech office.3  For example:<P>The development of a promising new biotech product that would prevent frost damage when sprayed on crops was cut short by the establishment of very expensive experimental hurdles by the EPA.  The product has thus far not been commercialized.<P>The Monsanto Company was denied permission to undertake a field test of a biotech product aimed at controlling a corn-eating insect.  Had Monsanto used a cruder "conventional" genetic technique, the field trial would not have been subject to government oversight at all.  Monsanto subsequently dismantled its entire microbial biocontrol program.<P>
EPA's policies have discouraged research on promising new techniques of bioremediation -- the detoxification of wastes using living organisms -- that could increase the effectiveness and reduce the costs of cleanups of toxic waste sites.<p>
	The basic problem is that these innovative biotech products are being subjected to higher regulatory hurdles simply because they are based on a new technology, despite evidence that they may well be safer and more effective than conventional alternatives.
<p> 
Communications
<p>
	The telecommunications area also offers numerous examples of how the government's licensing authority raises the cost and delays the introduction of new technologies.4  The 1934 Communications Act gives the FCC broad powers to license (1) wireline facilities and services used in interstate common carriage; and (2) the use of the electromagnetic spectrum.  Instead of serving consumers' interests, these licensing powers have lent themselves to abuse by incumbent firms interested in protecting their markets.  Few businesses or trade associations can resist the temptation to use available regulatory procedures against competitors:<p>
For example, although there is now general agreement that competition in long-distance markets has spurred innovation and pushed prices sharply down, the FCC successfully protected AT&T from long-distance competition for several decades.  The Commission's previous policy of forbidding competition in long-distance markets cost consumers tens of billions of dollars.<p>
The Commission's resistance to the provision of "enhanced services" by telephone companies has imposed another layer of costs, as demonstrated by the single example of voice-mail.  Today, phone companies provide voice-mail services at roughly five dollars a month per mailbox to roughly ten million customers.  Though the technology was available in the 1970s, if not earlier, FCC permission to deploy it did not come until 1988.  The cost to the economy from the Commission's delay in authorizing these services has been estimated at approximately $6 billion.<p>
The FCC's exclusion of phone companies from the provision of video programming and cable television, put in place in 1970, also has been costly.  The Commission subsequently came to the view that this policy might be inhibiting competition and began to reevaluate it -- a process that occupied the Commission for five years.  In 1992, the Commission concluded that telephone company provision of video-dialtone services should be allowed, but the Commission took another two years to approve the first application to provide such services.  Since cable rates are estimated to be 20 to 30 percent lower in markets served by more than one provider, the Commission's failure to authorize entry by phone companies obviously imposed billions of dollars of costs on cable subscribers.<p>
	The barriers to innovation from the FCC's power to license spectrum are, if anything, more striking:<p>
The introduction of both FM radio and television was delayed for years by FCC equivocation over which bands would be assigned to what uses.  FM radio technology, invented in 1933, was not in widespread use until the 1960s.  The modern television was exhibited by RCA in 1939, but the FCC took years to adopt initial standards and froze all applications for TV licenses until 1952.<p>
Cellular technology, first conceived in 1947 by Bell Laboratories, was not introduced commercially until the 1980s.  AT&T was operating its first experimental cellular telephone system in 1962, but the FCC did not even get around to allocating spectrum for cellular until 1974.  The first cellular licenses were not handed out until 1983.  Today, the cellular industry generates some $14.2 billion in revenues a year.  The decade of delay is estimated to have cost Americans roughly $85 billion.   
<p>
Concluding Comments
<p>
	In sum Madame Chairwoman, innovation is adversely affected by the current regulatory frameworks in critically important sectors of the economy where the technological opportunities are greatest.  At The Progress & Freedom Foundation, we have been developing a new framework for bringing medical products to market as well as a replacement model for current communications regulation.  Both of these models would reduce or eliminate the adverse effect the current regulatory structures have on the incentive to innovate.  We hope to have an opportunity to share our views as these issues are considered.      <p>

 Over the past several years there has been a dramatic retrenchment
of government's economic role.  Around the globe various countries
have privatized their banks, steel mills, post offices, air traffic
control systems and roads.  The change has been no less dramatic
in the energy sector.  Great Britain and Chile have already privatized
their electricity industries and several other countries are now
following suit.  Given this return to private enterprise in former
bastions of statism, it is somewhat embarrassing that, while the
Russians have privatized more than 10,000 firms in the past couple
of years, the U.S. Congress is finding it impossible to privatize
four agencies that generate and distribute electricity in the
South and West, and at most represent one-twentieth of one percent
of our GDP.
<P>

 These agencies, the Power Marketing Administrations (or PMAs
to their fans), were created over the past sixty years to market
power generated at dams operated by the Corps of Engineers and
the Bureau of Reclamation.  The electricity generated at these
facilities is sold at mostly below market rates to rural electric
co-operatives and local government utilities -- a group commonly
called &quot;preference customers&quot;.  
<P>
 Privatization of the PMAs has foundered on the effect it would
have on the electricity rates charged to consumers of this low-cost
power.  So far, various proposals to address this problem have
been lacking.  The preference customers have advocated that the
PMAs be sold to them at bargain prices.  This has run into the
opposition of private utility companies that also want the chance
to bid on the assets.  The House Resources Committee's plan, now
defunct, would have sold the Southeastern Power Administration
(SEPA) to the highest bidder, and mitigated any &quot;rate shock&quot;
with a regulatory rate cap.  
<P>
 The sale of SEPA has been waylaid by traditional interest group
politics.  The beneficiaries of this program (i.e., the preference
customers who receive subsidized power) have a concentrated interest
in this issue that, as usual, has trumped the general interest
of taxpayers who paid for the construction and operation of the
PMAs and currently subsidize the power.  It's been reported that
even the Bass Anglers Sporting Society fought the sale.  It seems
they fear the owners of the privatized dams will increase fees
at bass rich reservoirs.  This is yet another example of how good
intentions are simply not enough to move the process in Washington.
<P>
 In order to privatize the PMAs and, more  generally, in order
to truly reform the Federal government, we are going to have to
do more than just think good thoughts and exhort Congress to vote
the general interest.  We have to make change something special
interests desire rather than fear.
<P>
 In the area of privatization, we should learn from the experiences
of other countries around the world.  Through voucher and other
plans foreign governments have transformed natural opponents of
privatization such as employees and customers into stakeholders
and advocates.  The Czech Republic's voucher scheme was extraordinarily
successful.  It made the benefits of privatization obvious even
to &quot;widows and orphans&quot; for whom terms like &quot;shares&quot;
or &quot;stock exchange&quot; had still been rather foggy.
<P>
 Taking inspiration from the Czech experience we need to privatize
the PMAs in way that turns potential opponents into proponents.
 The way to do this is to convert the PMAs into government corporations.
 Next, the final consumers of PMA power -- those who use power
bought from a PMA to light their homes or run their businesses
-- would be given the option to purchase stock in the PMAs at
a price reflecting the value of the PMAs under current operating
conditions.  This option would be fully transferrable and so consumers
could either exercise it, thus become part-owners of the corporation,
or sell it to whomever they want under any conditions they agree
upon.  
<P>
  Unlike the proposals put forward so far by the preferred customers,
this legislation will open the sale up to any qualified bidder.
 This will ensure that the assets will wind up with those who
can use them most efficiently.  This approach will move decisions
about ownership and operation of these facilities out of committee
rooms in Washington and give those decisions to people who have
a direct interest in the outcome.  Interested buyers will have
to woo consumers instead of sending lobbyists to Washington. 
<P>
 However, unlike open sale proposals put forward so far by private
utilities, it will not leave in place an interest group protected
only by a governmental regulatory structure.  A wide-open bidding
process will bid up the value of the PMAs giving consumers the
chance to realize substantial gains by selling their options.
 Consumers will be compensated for any possible &quot;rate shock&quot;
through cash from the sale of their option, or appreciated stock.
<P>
 Most importantly, it will convert those who are now most fearful
of any change in ownership of the PMAs into supporters of privatization.
 Consumers will take an active interest in the process as they
check the financial pages of their newspaper every day for the
latest offer.  They will write their Congressman asking not to
stop the sale, but to expedite it so they can realize their gain
from the sale on the open market.
<P>
 In December of 1986, on the day Margaret Thatcher's government
was launching its privatization of British Gas, a crowd of about
a hundred people gathered in the foyer of the Manchester Stock
Exchange.  Before the sale, the government had done everything
possible--staggered payments, bonus and voucher schemes, and free
and matching shares--to encourage and empower former customers
and employees to buy shares.  That day, the foyer soon took on
the atmosphere of a bookie's office.  As the price of the newly
floated shares rose, the crowd cheered.  When prices faltered,
they booed.  This shows how a creative plan can capture the imagination
and support of the public.  
<P>
 The approach described above can change the current political
dynamic in a similar and dramatic way.  It would end government
involvement in generating electricity, an area where it no longer
needs to be involved.  It will also provide an example of the
innovative types of solutions that can be used to restructure
other areas of the Federal government.
<P>
 This concept will be incorporated into a bill that will be introduced
by one of the authors, Congressman Shadegg.  The plan will avoid
a sale to the current preference customers at below market rates,
which would not truly privatize these facilities.  A preference
sale would merely move the facilities from the left hand of the
government to the right, perpetuate subsidized power and hurt
the taxpayer.  
<P>
 The privatization plan embodied in the bill also avoids a &quot;trust
us&quot; sale to the existing private power companies under terms
which ask the current customers give up their benefit for nothing
and rely on a government regulatory structure to protect them
from rate shock.
<P>
 Following the example used around the world, giving a fully transferable
purchase option to the current customers meets two important criteria.
 First, it will achieve privatization at market rates, and second,
it will fully compensate the current customers.

<h2>Revolution</h2>
by <a href="/pff/people/sfellow.html#Vlahos">Michael Vlahos</a>
<P>
<P>
&#147;Revolution&#148; is one of those words.
<P>
Arguably, it is an American sacred word, like Freedom and Democracy,
Progress and Liberty.  But how we trivialize, and in turn, are
terrified by it!
<P>
It is a word perfect in its diminutive:  The HealthRider is a
&#147;revolutionary&#148; product;  Connecticut&#146;s state government
calls recycling &#147;the next American Revolution;&#148;  each
new electoral shift is hailed as a &#147;revolution.&#148;  We
like revolution as Progress Plus, as long as it stays in the comfort
zone of the familiar, and what we know as the good.  It is Big
Change we control.
<P>
Which is clearly what revolution is not.
<P>
We know this too, so we love the word, but we are afraid of it
too.  We love the revolution we made.  But after 1776 came 1789.
 Big Change was Shanghaied.  High-octane <I>Pilgrim&#146;s Progress</I>
was ditched for the <I>Beau Savage</I>, who led a descent into
the primitive, to The Terror.  Our sober, civic revolution was
stolen by firebrand French wordsmiths.
<P>
And the word itself was abducted too.  Passed from Robspierre
to Rosa, from Lenin to Stalin to the Khmer Rouge, the word has
stayed blood-red, like the roses, cockades, and little red books
that are its symbols.
<P>
We Americans have never recaptured revolution.  We lay claim only
to a patch of thin turf by the great shore, that strip of change
at the edge of Progress.  We are wary now, even afraid, of change
beyond Progress.  We no longer know what to do with revolution.
<P>
But we cannot escape it.  Big change is here:  brought not by
barbarians at the gate, but by ourselves.  We are the barbarians
of big change.  We are the red-capped <I>sans culottes</I>.
<P>
America is again making revolution, and spreading it across the
world.  This revolution should not be confused with political
plots or electoral sallies against an Old Order.  This revolution
is much bigger than that;  like the industrial revolution, it
promises a transformation of America life.  But as tidally overwhelming
as it feels, it is no less of our own making.  And clearly, there
are those who are making it happen, just as there are those who
would sacrifice everything to hold its onset back just one more
day.  Like any revolution.
<P>
The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation&#146;s monthly lunches offer
us a chance to talk about Big Change as revolution.  They were
inspired by the fermentive talk that came before the first Bastille
Day&#150;those notorious <I>salons</I>&#150;but they are not meant
to imitate the outcome.  The logo roses on our <I>Notes From Salon
&#145;89</I> are meant to remind us of two things.  First that,
though it was stolen way back when, the word is now up for recapture.
 And second, the shock of other times tells us that revolution
is not about freeze frame shots from <I>Dr. Zhivago</I> or <I>A
Tale of Two Cities</I>.  Revolution is not some far away, long
ago story, so removed from us as to be nothing more than material
for a Hollywood meringue.
<P>
Revolution waits in the wings of every age.  It comes rarely,
but it comes for a reason.  Revolution is the moment when change
long pent up at last tears the fabric of life;  when all the elements
that allow us daily to accommodate to change, for a moment, fail.
 Revolution is the brief, free space between two worlds, and our
time in that space allows us to make the journey from old to new.
<P>
And who knows?  Perhaps Progress will prevail somehow, and the
Big Change will be managed and massaged so that, when it is over,
we never knew what happened.  It is possible.
<P>
Every fiber of mind teases and coaxes us down that road.  But
we don&#146;t need to worry about continuity:  we must confront
the equally possible prospect of its <I>absence</I>.
<P>
And to see possibility, we need to recapture the word:  Revolution.
 Part of that comes when we talk about it &#133; which is what
we intend to keep doing at our lunches.
<P>
We hope you will let us know if you are interested in joining
us.

<I><B>Life After the Big Change</B></I>

<P>
<blockquote>
<I>Long day.  Ache all over.</I>  She had already kicked off her
shoes.  <I>Where's the boy?  His city screen should be on.  As
soon as learning time's up, he's all over the back streets.</I>
 But she just wants to lie back in her bed, turn to her favorite
stage door hangout;  not join, just watch.  The day was rough.
 Rush delivery behind schedule just because one in a box of tomato
cubes was bruised.  Lying back, she reaches for the navpad.  <I>My
favorite place or something different?</I>  She subscribes to
several byte cities, Metro Disney, Main Street, Maple Avenue,
Opreyville, The Village, City on the Hill (strictly for Sundays),
and even Downtown USA.  <I>Take the keys to our city!  Downtown
USA!  Yeah, it was the biggest, but what a zoo!  Metropolis was
the kinkiest, better save that for Saturday night.</I>  So she
opts for the less stressed out fun of TBA [The Big Apple].  She
cranks up the City Screen;  <I>make it early evening</I>.  The
whole wall, an enormous living rendition of Monet's <I>Water Lilies</I>,
dissolves like fine rain into a great central square.  Times Square.
 But this is not the tired, seedy theme park of today.  No, this
is the halcyon Times Square of the last century!
<P>
<I>Yeah, this was cool.  All that old neon.  City lights!</I>
 She steered herself to a chrome yellow checker, told the agent
where to take her.  AI Agents came with the service, of course.
 Part of being a full citizen of the Big Apple.  She was off,
peering without craning her neck, at the fantasia of old New York,
sort of circa 1939, more fetidly baroque than any single imagination
could ever have encompassed ... spires and ziggurats and lurid
Babylonian bronze entablature, bigger and wilder than any made
by history and humankind.  But she, and a 22 percent share for
this time period, was bedazzled. <I>125th Street, The Apollo --
I'm here!</I>  
</blockquote>
<P>
Welcome to the fourth life of the American city:  our new urban
world;  America after the Big Change.  <I><B>Byte City!</B></I>
<P>
Not science fiction.  Not prediction.  Not the future -- Just
a way of talking about how we get there.  Because getting there
means that something <B>Big </B>happens.  People will exclaim:
 <I>It's a revolution!</I>
<P>
Well, if it's a revolution, then Big Change means upheaval.  Revolution
cannot be rouged and face-lifted into pretty Progress.  Revolution
is not mere improvement.  Revolutions are upendings.  Old ways
actually lie down and die right at our feet, like statues of Louis
or Lenin.
<P>
Everyone says we are living in such a time.  Look at their big
titles for Big Change:  Toffler talks <I>Third Wave</I>, or Drucker's
orotund <I>Transformation of American Life</I>.  But then, nothing
dreadful happens.  Nothing even fantastic happens.  Tomorrow is
wonderful, different, difficult, but a lot like today.  Only more
so, like a straight line on a chart.  And problems?  <I>Weeell</I>,
they can be <I>managed</I>.
<P>
But revolution will force on us the integrity of destruction.
 We can pretend that everything will stay the same even as everything
changes, but revolution will not listen.  Fortunately.
<P>
If this is revolution beginning to hit, then let's talk about
the real thing. That is the reason for <I>Byte City</I>.  Byte
City meets the acid strip dip of Big Change.  It's big enough
to change our lives like the last Big Change.  Remember:  The
<I>Industrial</I> Revolution?  It blew the old world apart, it
made a new one, and it gave us new life.
<P>
And we still think of it as Modern.  Well, get over it.  It's
now the oldest old order around.  Not just <I>Rust Belt</I>, but
<I>Big City</I>, <I>Edge City</I>, the Paramus Mall too.  Dead,
Dead, Dead.  Byte City is a way to kill the old world in our minds
before it's torn up right in front of us.  Byte City is a way
to get to change as big as coal, steam, pig iron, and iron rails
wrought right where we live.
<P>
That wall-plastering, flat-panel <I>virtu-screen</I> is a portal
into a new urban world.  Our gut tells us that this tool literally
pries open a door into a new way of life.  Thinking it through
is like asking a Scot in 1775:  <I>Tell us about the railroad.</I>
<P>
Would he have said:  <I>Sure:  iron horse, new net of cities belching
smoke, it's all coming, I can see it.  O yeah</I>.
<P>
Or would he scratch his head, squint, and say: <I> Sure would
make stagecoaches faster, if they could go on rails.  Heavier
loads too, easier for drays to haul.  But the teams would need
good gravel beds, or they might bust their hooves.</I>
<P>
Byte City's one cut at the time traveler's question to us.  We
might not do any better than our Scottish cousin, but at least
we have his revolution as guide.  The upheaval that would revvv
up <I>his</I> lifetime helps us see the roar that is already growling
in our <I>own</I>.  <I>Byte City</I> is a metaphor of revolution
<I>now</I> we can stack up against revolutions <I>then</I>:
<P>
Like the one that hit Britain after 1815, and the United States
after 1876.  And they help us look ahead because they happened
to people like us.
<P>
<U><I>They are us</I></U>:  near in time, same in space.
<P>
Kinship helps, because we can watch how they got through it, and
we can pace ourselves.  Big Change is history's gauntlet.  We
have to get through it too.
<P>
So their stories may be our own.  But still ours to tell.  Technology
hits, but <U><I>we</I></U> do the transformation;  <U><I>we</I></U>
make the moves;  <U><I>we</I></U> do the change.
<P>
And it all seems to start after big wars of ideas, big heroic
journeys;  finished, only to find a new one has begun, for
<ul>
<B>Britain</B> after the <I>Napoleonic Wars</I>.
<P>
<B>The United States</B> at the end of <I>Reconstruction</I>.
<P>
<B>And us</B>, after the <I>Cold War</I>.

<br><I><B>  and get me moving</B></I>
<P>
<I><B>--GreenDay</B></I>
</center>
<P>
Start with <I><B>The Driver</B></I>.  <I>Iron horse, locomotive,
train</I>:  The railroad drove change.  And it was more than change's
tool.  It worked into our brain as song and story and myth.  It
became the industrial world's kinetic cathedral.
<P>
Because it had the raw power of faith.  <B>It was the god of destruction</B>.
 Steam was a juggernaut where worshippers of <I>The Modern</I>
threw down their old world, to be crushed under its wheels.  <B>It
was the icon of power</B>. The railroads reeked the highest octanes
of power, Apollo Program stuff, done by billionaire barons and
tycoons.  <B>It was the layer down of judgment</B>.  Its terrible
mix of underworld and the machine--belching cinders, its engine
roaring through the night--told all that <I>The Modern</I> had
no room for the sentimentality of old ways of life [Didn't DOS
do the same?  We, the new, sneered at the pathetic losers who
needed an interface to play].
<P>
But what did the rails make possible?  They made the new city;
 they raised it up as the main place, the place we lived.  People
and industry were joined, and trapped, in bleak sites of mutual
need.  And the rails brought us there.
<P>
And it was, truly, transformation.  The railroad's impact immediately
and visibly moved peoples' lives.  A plaintive cry from the <I>The
Nation</I>, in 1873:
<center><P>
<I>The locomotive is coming in contact with the very framework
of our institutions ...</I>
</center><P>
Contact.  Like the great host of a plague bacillus, or a horde
of lepers.  The end of small town America, Erie Canal America
... <I>&quot;low bridge, coming to a town ... &quot;</I>
<P>
And how it swarmed!  It was fast.  We're so proud of our burn
cycle for CPUs.  But the speed burn of change in last-century
US and Britain should wipe that smirk clean off.  The entire rail
net of Britain was built in just fifteen years, from 1841 to 1855.
 After the Civil War, from 1865 to 1873, thirty thousand miles
were laid here.  Life transformed in the span of one young adulthood.
<P>
Charles Francis Adams, old elite, 1868, clothed his shock in romantic
metaphor, back after five years in the Court of St. James:
<center>
<P>
<I>Had we been Tyrian traders of the year 100 BC landing from
a galley fresh from Gibraltar, we could hardly have been stranger
or the shore of a world, so changed from what it had been ten
years before.</I>
<P>
</center>
His old city was gone.

<P>
<I><B>Is it concrete all around</B></I>
<br><I><B>Or is it in my brain?</B></I>
<br><I><B>--David Bowie</B></I>
</center>
<P>
And what was the city?  It was:  <I><B>Where We Live</B></I>.
 Think sentimental, think Adams' Beacon Hill;  then think what
took its place.  You have just defined <I>revolution</I>.  Because
revolution made a new city, and the new city was the place where
peoples' lives were upended as they entered.  The city stripped
off old identity.  People naked of meaning jostled and elbowed
their way, packed together in brick and cobbled isometric planes,
until they found something new.  Migrations to the new cities
threw whole worlds together, cramming entire tribes into tenements
by the 7th Avenue El.  Forget the old romance of the bazaar, the
ancient trade city's waterfront teeming with Lascars, Phoenicians,
Tartars, and Greeks.
<P>
That was original city, <I>entrepot</I> city.  Trade made, on
river and sea-nexus, like London or New York.  From its hub spoked
the hinterland network of villages and towns.  How different was
the new net of industrial urbs!  Take a classic of its kind, Springfield,
Ohio. At its height, home for 80,000.  Springfield was a local
industrial hub anchored by three big national plants:  Crowell-Collier,
International Harvester, and Robbins and Myers.  And what remained
of the old agricultural world of Clark County brought its bounty
there in homage to the new city, to the farmer's market in the
neo-Romanesque city hall, stone tower shining city pride just
like 15th century Siena or Bologna.  Oak-shaded Wittenburg was
its civilization-badge, with a football team Ronald Reagan could
have played on, while oysters on ice came every morning by those
rails, fresh from Chesapeake Bay.
<P>
America's whole world was wired by railroad;  cities wired within
by streetcars, and wired without into a national network of cities,
with the former <I>entrepot</I> cities now grown to giant <I>metropoli</I>:
 Chicago, New York, LA.  If we think of the city as a node in
the network of our lives, it is the merest step of imagination
to see what <I>Byte City</I> will be for us.
<P>
The big screen of <I>Byte City</I>, ten or twenty years from now,
is today's railroad, today's god of destruction and creation.
 The railroad was <I>force majeure</I> in English:  it moved people
to the city, moved in goods they wanted, and moved out goods they
made.  The virtu-screen doesn't move anything ... but it brings
everything to us.  The city is in our living room, or wherever
we want it to be.  The portal becomes a vehicle, and like the
railroad before, <I>&quot;it is coming into contact with the very
framework&quot;</I> of our lives.
<P>

</center>
<P>
So then the next piece of Big Change:  <I><B>Loss of Order and
Connectedness</B></I>.  The new net clung to the heels of the
rails:  Life cobbling to the factories clustering around each
new depot.  People poured into them, searching first for jobs,
and then for a sense of belonging.  Migrants from farm to slum
could not bring with them their own old net of traditions, the
rooted weave of relationships that was small town America.
<P>
Small town America was our mythic heart.  As Robert Weibe tells
it,
<ul>
&quot;small-town life was America's norm in the mid-seventies
<I>[1870s].</I>  Groups of these towns fell into satellite patterns
about a larger center <I>[the entrepot]</I>, to which they looked
for markets and supplies, credits and news.  But however much
they actually relied upon an outside world, they still managed
to retain the sense of living largely to themselves.  With farms
generally fanning around them, these communities moved to the
rhythms of agriculture: the pace of the sun's day, the working
and watching of the crop months, the cycle of the seasons.&quot;
</ul>
Alien.  Weird.  Wild.  New cities broke rhythm itself by busting
the rule of order.  Nature's rules now knelt to human imagination.
 Cities of wonder -- and inescapable wonderment only added to
their sense of <I>anomie</I>.  It was easier for migrants to take
the filth, disease, and toxicity of the new net than the squeeze
of a reality overwhelming and fantastical.  New building systems
of iron made easy Neo-Classical fantasies that Palladio could
but have dreamed of:  symbolized in Britain by the Crystal Palace
of Victoria's heyday;  then, in America, by the Skyscraper, the
<I>El</I>, and endless canyons of steel.  The landscape itself
disoriented in its strangeness,.  It was both harsh and dreamlike,
as in T. S. Eliot's image from <I>The Wasteland</I>:  &quot;<I>unreal
city, under the brown fog of a winter dawn ...&quot;</I>
<P>
We have all read stories of the city's capacity for <I>anomie</I>:
 like my grandfather coming to New York as a boy, hawking fruit
and flopping in a tenement room with twenty others on the lower
East Side; then the rails to Springfield for a job, and ending
up in the wrong Springfield:  Ohio, not Massachusetts.  There
are so many unspoken stories about those times embedded in our
minds, in the place where myth resides.
<P>
But people could make the warp from farm to factory, cabin to
tenement.  Living conditions and physical alienation were not
the problem:  loss of identity was.  Loss of connection hurt when
people were torn, not from the soil, but from their own defining
labor, the worth that came from work.  For example, the industrial
revolution savaged the place of the craftsman in society.  Pittsburgh,
known before 1860 as the &quot;Craftsman's Empire,&quot; became
in just twenty years a kingdom of steel, where labor replaced
craft.  And the furnaces offered no status equal to what was lost.
<P>
What had been lost was identity itself.  The new world of the
assembly line seemed to reduce men and women to mere auxiliaries
of the machine.

<P>
Call this a problem of <I><B>More Money, Less Meaning</B></I>.
 Our soft, clean mind mode cringes before their cities of disease
and death.  Death rates in Britain stayed the same from 1820 to
1870, even though life expectancy was soaring in the countryside.
 Why?  Because city air and water was killing so many.  A Southern
slave in 1850 lived twenty years longer than the average Northern
industrial worker.  But that Northerner just shrugged.  Farm life
scraped hard too.
<P>
They liked the money.  Wages were higher in the new cities.  For
young men freed from the farm, <U>a lot more money</U>.  For example,
real wages in U.S. industry grew more than 40 percent between
1865 and 1873.  People could put up with the crazed atmosphere
of the this world:  the weltering, roiling, pinball pulse of the
new city.  They could put up with the disorientation, and they
could put up with the physical abuse.  Because they had more money,
they believed their quality of life was improving.
<P>
Ah, but then come &quot;depressions.&quot;  <I>The Panic of 1873!</I>
 Progress was replaced by uncertainty.  And uncertainty exploded:
<P>
<center>
<I>Will I be paid a good wage, will I be able to raise a family
in a decent place, will I be treated with dignity for what I do?</I>
</center>
<P>
A wave of depressions followed fast on industry's tide.  They
banged home the brittleness of industrial identity.  Lay-off,
throw out -- <I>You'll work for this, right?</I> -- because new
labor had no given status.  Society had no rules, no custom and
taboos, to regulate the new.  Sure, craftsmen and farmers had
stature and place in the old order of things, but this was waning
work.  No one knew what status to give the new work.
<P>
Money is only a parts-maker for status.  Money is always there,
pieces in the machine of meaning:  a badge of rank, a tool of
display;  but cash only helps make the whole work.  Identity is
a mysterious endowment of society.  Money is no substitute.  Money
can prop up identity in doubt, but only for a time.  People need
to know where they stand with each other.
<P>
So money propped up status in the new work -- for a while.  But
when the market cracked, so to did the identity of the new worker.
 Kicked out of work, wages cut;  arbitrary, brutal signs that
told the new workers:  <I>you are no longer what you were</I>.
 <I>Maybe you are no better than a slave</I>.  And old social
compacts were torn up across all old divides.  What happened to
farmers and craftsmen also happened to yesterday's middle management:
nostalgia's fat, jolly traders who thronged the <I>entrepot</I>
cities and fed the small towns.
<P>
Big change ripping up old meaning lived on in folk songs and literature
alike.  Then our memory of the trauma condensed down to a few
quaint characters  What happened to John Henry?  What happened
to Old Fezziwig?
<P>
What happened to them is the story of a <B>spike</B>.  The total
the Big Change --  the transformation -- took decades, but the
stories come out of a time when a single generation took the main
hit.  Before that, change was being accommodated.  Sure, you could
see the stretch marks, but it was still the same old place.  Things
kept changing and changing and changing ... and then ... then
it was suddenly a whole new place.
<P>
<I>Where am I?</I>  This is the spike.  It hits one generation;
they are the <I>before and after</I> people.  Theirs is the moment
of crisis, they are the ones who make the psychic passage from
one world to another.
<P>
The crisis is not physical.  It is not about problems like pollution
or plagues or panics.  The crisis is about a mind jump.  And there
is one group that just can't make it:
<P>
The Old Order. The Ruling Class.  The Elite.
<P>
Whatever the <I>Blue Book</I> cut is on who runs things, throw
it out.  Throw out the book too.  Because establishments are all
about staying <I>established</I>.  When Big Change happens and
they can't see it, they become <I>dis-.</I>
<P>
They still have power.  Sure, like Gorbachev's generals still
had tanks.  Thousands of them.  <U>They had power, but they did
not have authority</U>.
<P>
And authority is about belief.  Elites get to be elites because
people believe in them, and they believe in their ideas.  All
Old Orders were once New Ideas told by people with fire in their
eyes.  And their message was simple:  we know where we are all
going, and we can get you there.  These people become the new
elite because the majority of <I>all the people</I> believe them.
<P>
Elites fail because they forget this is why they are there.  They
come to think that they are there to preserve a world <U>where
they rule</U>.  They come to speak only to themselves, and, while
change is roaring through society, the only people who still believe
them are themselves.  Worse for them, they come to think that
self-belief is what authority is all about.
<P>
And that is when they really lose it.

<P>
History always remembers the moment when a ruling society discovers
it can no longer rule, because it has lost the belief of its people:
 the moment that  <I><B>Old Ideas [and Elites] Lose Authority</B></I>
<P>
How do old elites come to fail in the face of Big Change?  They
make four big mistakes:
<P>
<ul>
<I><B>R</B>uling Elites cannot see the change, in part because
it hits right after a period of triumph for them, a time when
their own authority has been unquestioned.</I>
<P>
<I><B>W</B>hen faced with change, elites try to deny what is happening.</I>
<P>
<I><B>W</B>hen the change cannot be held off, ruling elites try
to control, or &quot;manage&quot; change to preserve their position.</I>
<P>
<I><B>W</B>hen the handwriting is on the wall, many among the
elite embrace the new vision, ensuring survival for many ...</I>
<P>
</ul>
... but it is too late for Old Elite society as a whole. The irony
of it all is that the unraveling begins at the moment the ruling
elite is least disposed to accept it.  It happens at the moment
of their triumph.
<P>
Look at the British ruling class after 1815.  23 years fighting
Napoleon ... now <I>Boney</I> was finally doing time on St. Helena.
 Five coalitions it took to do him in;  an Iliad of a war.  But
when it was done, the British latifundial elite -- you know, rolling
estates and country &quot;homes&quot; big as Versailles -- owned
the world, superpower-care-free as a fox hunt.  And right then,
that instant, it all began to strip itself away.  Why?  Because
the entire energy and effort of British society, of British life,
had come to be written as a great struggle.  The elite's bible
was Bonaparte, where he was the Devil of change and upheaval.
 So when he was banished at last, the ruling class thought:  <I>We
have conquered change itself!</I>  Could they just imagine that
by beating Boney, they would lose their last claim on control
of their own?  <I>No</I>. Their world was swirling around them,
and they thought -- <I>wonder of wonders!</I> -- that their authority
was never more majestic.  Double false pride.
<P>
The same thing was true of the United States, which had just fought
its own foreign war.  It happened to be against our own people,
<I>The South</I>.  Like a well-lathered 16-part miniseries, it
wasn't just a war.  It started in the 1850s, with the rise of
Radical Republicanism.  There was Bleeding Kansas, Abe Lincoln's
election, John Brown's body, the Big Bang Battle Hymn of the Republic.
 And after Appomatox, the saga continued.  Crusading war dissolved
into crusading politics:  the uplifting of the wicked called <I>Reconstruction</I>.
 Good <I>vs.</I> Evil, national energy tasked to ideology, and
speechifying leaders -- for 20 years, from 1856 to 1876, we had
our own Iliad.  While gilt-edged Brit elite sang <I>See the Conquering
Hero Comes!</I>, ours claimed emotional authority from <I>The
Union Forever!</I>  Serial melodrama, year after year, was the
elite theater of authority.
<P>
Cold War sound familiar now?  Was Washingtonian strutting any
different, gloating in its <I>End of History</I> triumphalism?
 Call <I>Johnny Reb</I> and<I> Jean Crapaud</I> bad miniseries,
but they had <U>action</U>.  Cold War was plain bad soap opera.
 Like<I> General Hospital</I>, it got very tedious, lapsing in
the end into a stream of mock crises and snore summits.  But the
Sponsors loved it.  And why not?  The Soviet Union had settled
in like welfare squatters on the first floor of American life.
 Commies consumed attention, they sanctioned elite power.  What
could be more important than 50,000 nukes in your face?
<P>
Fifty years should have ratified forever;  but then, suddenly,
it all went away.  And since then, America has suffered the sordid
spectacle of a ruling elite desperately trying to justify its
right to rule on one hand, while PC-bullying the rest of us to
keep taking orders on the other.
<P>
And while that old elite spent the early 1990s in earnest gush
that America would not make it without more elite control -- <I>We're
in economic decline, we need an industrial policy!  We need to
run the world or it will be a mess!  We need national health care!</I>
-- the rest of society was moving toward the first act of revolution.
<P>
Elites make revolutions happen.  They are why we have revolutions
at all:  because elites try to postpone change.  And while they
get their <I>Best and Brightest</I> to tell us why change is bad,
or why it shouldn't happen unless they regulate it ... it happens.
<P>
And in order for it to happen, change has to overcome elite resistance.
 What old elites achieve is the opposite of what they want.  Their
resistance speeds up the very unraveling of authority that they
fear.  Boom!  They garrotte themselves.. We call the public execution:
 revolution.
<P>
Elites not only make revolution possible, <I>they are its midwives</I>.

<P>
So the next movement:  <I><B>Old Elites Fail, New Do Not Lead</B></I>.
<P>
But what does elite failure look like?  Elite failure doesn't
mean inevitable tumbrels and a Terror.  The erosion of the old
order and its authority rushes toward a series of happenings that
end the sway of the old ruling elites, and usher in a period without
leadership.  Those who have made economic revolution are not like
the old order they unseat.  They are not the bureaucrats who rise
to high estate as <I>Masters of the Job Description</I>.  Their
roughshod power comes from making things happen, not trying to
stop them.  That is why their Homeric title would be <I>Breakers
of Bureaucrats, </I>because that is what they do while they make
change happen.  They don't know anything about creating a new
system, they would howl at the prospect of <I>going into government</I>.
 They would say:
<P>
<blockquote>
<I>Let a new path emerge naturally from the new world.  You can't
force a new path.  That's exactly why the old order failed.  They
tried to hold back change.  And if holding back change was the
problem, then change itself is the solution.  The old won't work,
but everything new will.</I>
</blockquote>
<P>
Makers of economic revolution are the necessary agents of change,
but not necessarily the new leaders of society.  Aged elites in
both Britain and the United States flunked the leadership test
when upheaval hit hardest.  Everyone could see that those in charge
blew it.  But the new enterprisers who spearheaded revolution
also failed.  Omission, not commission -- but still failure. 
The standard was theirs to hold.  They just failed to pick it
up.
<P>
The United States and Britain then snagged in midstream, lodged
on a mudbank period of drift in politics, juxtaposed crazily with
the roaring whitewater energies of economic change.  The result:
 the disorder and disconnectedness in peoples lives grew.  Society
itself seemed about to fall apart, while old <I>and</I> new elites,
fearful of the outcome, twitched feebly, with some shaky rattling
of armed authority from above. 
<P>
But feeble gestures only lashed the alienation of the rest from
ruling elites that had squandered their authority.
<P>
How did the elite fail in Britain?  The gentry made a good start
by ignoring what was happening.  Few were actually involved in
business.  There were no landed people who were also corporate
owners in Parliament in 1820, or in 1830.  More tied in with business
as the revolution gathered steam, but gently.  <I>I have  a nephew
in business;  I'm a barrister, you know</I>.  A few might sit
on a corporate board somewhere.  But they let the world pass them
by.  The new Barons--as in Beer Barons, known as <I>The Beerage</I>--were
knocking on the temple doors.
<P>
Then they went out and undercut themselves in style.  If any figure
helped to delegitimate the old order, it was George IV.  Call
him <I>The Prince of Pleasure</I>; let him prove it at 96-course
meals.  Let his friend Beau Brummel offer the only gift of his
regime to society:  the starched collar.
<P>
And this ruling class didn't even try to wonk -- they just let
their policies plain fail.  The politics of that old order are
remembered in the union workhouses, the poorhouse, debtors' prisons,
Luddite loom-smashing, and Redcoats firing on the crowd at Peterloo.
 But political failure was in Britain a far cry from political
fall.  Taking gentry power apart took more than a generation.
 You don't remember?  That's the trouble.  It's so far away now,
like looking at life through dark historical mica.
<P>
The United States?  What failure here?  The pearl of Radical Republicanism
was ground down in the embarrassments of, and backlash against,
a forever unfinished, internal war of ideology.
<P>
Forever repression of the South was failing.  It was failing because
of exhaustion and recognition:  exhaustion over the strain of
beating down our own Reb face in the mirror;  and recognition
that its goals <I>could not</I> be achieved [and so many in the
North, sadly, who did not want them to be achieved].
<P>
But there were <I>undercurrents</I> too, and the undercurrants
that helped kill Reconstruction were more interesting.  Among
them was a gathering in the gut that the <I>Grapes of Wrath</I>
elite -- who had blazed to trample Rebel vineyards -- was giving
way to a group of New Men, <I>Organization Men</I> of the Grant
Administration who cared nothing for America's soul, but plenty
for promises of patronage, and the river of rewards from the new
<I>machine politics</I>.
<P>
And this replacement-Republican elite resisted the claims of the
thronging new workers of the industrial cities.  But the workers
kept claiming, pushed by economic &quot;panic&quot; and depression.
 Their champions began to talk about something called a &quot;moral
economy,&quot; and Ira Steward wrote that<I> &quot;something of
slavery&quot;</I> remained in the North.
<P>
What happened in America in the later 1870s was that the crusading
vision that created Reconstruction was coming home.  It was no
longer held aloft by an elite that once led the grand, rolling
bayonet charge down Cemetery Ridge;  but by regular people, people
who were now forced to defend themselves against the young changelings
of the righteous elite that so recently led them into battle.

<P>
There was a <I><B>Demand for New Meaning</B></I>.
<P>
People began to rebel against their own elite because they felt
betrayed by it, and the people were right.  Grant's New Men seized
fast advantage of industry's stripping of work's status.  And
where the elite firebrands of the 1850s would do anything to give
all Americans full citizenship, their young changelings of the
1870s fought to take it away from all but a few.  The Organization
Men feared full citizenship for all, because they feared it would
mean a workers' world:  the end of their own world.  But turning
on their old ideals, the Republican New Men set out on a corrosive
path, betraying their fathers, denying their heritage, and foretelling
their own, eventual fall.
<P>
Because demand for new meaning would not be denied;  someone was
going to come along and supply it.  And they would lay claim to
leadership.  But first, how was this demand expressed?
<P>
In Britain, early on, there were rural bonfires, from the Luddite
to the Captain Swing disturbances.  But these were the lashings
out of a dying countryside, futile and distant flares of things
to come.
<P>
The real demand could be felt as industry really took root in
Britain, with the migrations in full flood.  Unionism, and then
the Chartist movement were able in the 1840s to put real pressure
on the ruling elite, <I>through politics</I>.  The peoples' demand
-- politely put.
<P>
In the United States, it was more violent.  As Grant's New Men
rose to be <I>Robber Barons</I> in a <I>Gilded Age</I> [what a
turn of phrase on <I>Golden Age</I>!], they defended their civic
order, and their property, by building forts in the heart of every
city.  These arsenals still exist.  What were called armories,
were really castles, strongholds of the robber Barons.
<P>
They were thrown up after the labor rebellions --The Great Strike
of 1877.  They were there so the army and militia could drag out
the guns and sweep the streets.
<P>
Because everyone remembered the whole of Philadelphia's railroad
yards in flames.  If the railroad was the centerpiece of transformation,
the symbol of new elite power, then imagine the elite's shock
as they watched them burn into the night.  Out came the army,
the guns, the grapeshot ... Ergo, the armories.
<P>
And ergo, labor unions.  The number of major unions in America
went from 3 to 21 in the 1870s.
<P>
But as workers mobilized to fight against the elite, society slid
into crisis.  And what is <I>crisis</I>?  It is not <I>coming
apart</I>;  it is the dawning fear that we will unless ... 
<P>
Remember the mind jump from the old world to the new?  In the
gilded age we weren't making it;  and the longer it was ignored,
the harder, our gut said, it would be to get to the other side.
 As Henry Holt wrote in 1895:
<P>
<I>... the large majority of intellectual people </I>[read: elites]<I>
are peacefully sitting on a crust covering a mephitic chasm, or,
as many think, a volcano.</I>
<P>
It was a crisis that the absence of a ruling idea seemed to make
inevitable.

</center>
<P>
And its absence for twenty years [<I>1876-1896</I>] became something
of a <I>desideratum</I>--the thing most wanted--in American life.
 Demand for new meaning went unfulfilled until <I><B>A Vision,
A Movement, and Order</B></I> came again to national life.
<P>
And not surprisingly,  it was found in elite form; that is, in
an elite that would lead.
<P>
And leadership meant religion.  Reaffirmation.  Religious revival
among American and British elites was a symbol to everyone else
that they could believe in elites again.  A bond of trust with
regular people was renewed.  But there was more.  Revival connected
personal religious calling to civic calling.  Individuals among
the renewed elite suddenly had authority again:  their voices
for reform rang true.  People got excited again.  People believed
again.  Things got done.
<P>
In Britain, this was called Methodism.  Methodist membership soared
in the decades after Wesley's death in 1791, from about 50,000
to more than 500,000 in 1840.  The important thing to know is
that Methodism became the religion of the new elite.
<P>
Methodism gave a new elite something far better than power:  moral
authority.  And this authority was not just put to the reform
of religion: the revolt of chapel [Methodism] against Church [the
ruling class' state religion].  Righteous Methodists brought their
reform faith to bear on all society.  They would cleanse a society
corrupted by Old Order thinking ... through modern thought.  They
would bring in universities and <I>&quot;institutes&quot;</I>
of expertise based on scientific methods.  Above all, they would
legitimate a <I>new class</I> of professionals, who could face
the problems of the world with an integrity [from the Latin <I>purity</I>.
 Clean!] given by reason and education.
<P>
The most important symbol of the new liberalism was the person
of the monarch herself.  The Georgian kings were the family heads
of their ruling society;  they represented the landed class and
their right to rule--and also, in George IV, their vanity, backwardness,
and profligacy.  Victoria, crowned just five years after the first
Reform Act, deliberately set a new course, where monarchy followed
reform, and by embracing it, decisively legitimated it.  Victoria,
in her person, embodied the new elite ethos.  Her sobriety, modesty,
and rectitude gave liberalism national authority.  Here was a
middle class, modern monarch, championing the new agenda of teetotalers,
social crusaders, and engineers.
<P>
And the idea of a democratic franchise gradually took root.  The
sway of the landed elite was worn away between the two reform
acts of 1832 and 1867, and the Beerage was co-opted into the new
spirit of the age.  The Corn Laws were repealed, and a ten-hour
work week was passed in 1841.
<P>
But getting to the new vision -- giving order to a chaotic transformation
in national life -- was long and hard-fought.
<P>
The vision was not even conceived until well after the initial
pulse of economic revolution, and no part of the new vision came
from the old order.  Nothing.  <I>Nada</I>.  And from the rollicking
new elites? -- A new way of life, a new context, a new physical
texture of existence.  But not meaning, not vision, and certainly
-- save for the same elites in their cozy brownstones -- not <I>order</I>.
<P>
The vision came out of a different elite that itself emerged as
individuals deserting both the old order elite and the new industrial
elite.
<P>
The Progressive movement renewed the American ruling class in
much the same way as Methodism led Britain's social revival, fifty
years later.  But our driving religious impulse was Presbyterianism,
offering a kind of Calvinist <I>noblesse oblige</I>, which gave
the early Progressives their high sense of order, determinism
and drive.
<P>
So much of Britain's reform was mirrored in America's elite revival:
<P>
<U><I>Temperance</I></U><I>:</I>  British <I>Teetotalism</I> transmuted
into our own, <I>Prohibition</I>;
<P>
<U><I>Anti-serfdom</I></U><I>:</I>  Not only a kindred lineage
from Wilberforce [<I>the Brit who stopped the slave trade</I>]
to Abolition, but a stretching of the anti-slavery metaphor to
industrial labor;
<P>
<U><I>The Rule of Reason</I></U><I>:</I>  From Bentham [<I>such
a modern guy he had himself stuffed and put on display in London
U., the place he founded</I>] and Britain's university surge,
to a skyrocketing of American engineering [<I>see below</I>] Ph.D.'s,
just before the Progressive era;  and,
<P>
<U><I>Administration by the Engineer</I></U><I>:</I>  The great
fairs in St. Louis and Chicago presaged the Progressive new wave,
just as the Great Exhibition of 1850 gave physical symbolism to
a new sense of order in British society.  Both built their vision
of progress on the physical mastery of the engineer <I>[hence,
the easy glide to &quot;social engineering&quot;].</I>
<P>
The Progressive movement had achieved its goals by 1920.  The
two <U><I>Time</I></U> cover men of the new generation, smooth
bringers of enlightened government and managed society, were Bernard
Baruch and Herbert Hoover.  Their gaze locked to a cloudless future.
<P>
But the nature of labor could not be jammed into an ordered dream
society.  One problem was the decline in agricultural jobs.  Farm
labor still nearly equaled manufacturing in 1900:  13 million
manual [industrial and related] workers, vice 11 million farm
laborers.  The broad swathe of what was now called &quot;white
collar&quot; was still small, at 5 million. 
<P>
Progressives had carefully crafted a world celebrating the worker,
where every American -- <I>as worker </I>-- could manufacture
their own American Dream.  The new managers expected that farm
labor would plummet as mechanized agriculture advanced.
<P>
What they did not anticipate was a decline in assembly line jobs.
 Not only were fewer and fewer needed in agriculture, but fewer
and fewer were needed to make things.  The obvious response was
to coax demand to keep pace with manufacturing efficiency.  Gone
would be the late-century terror of slumps and industrial surplus.
 Some say that to do this the managers created a cult of consumerism,
of ever-growing demand, to keep the workers' world going.  Sly
Pied Pipers!
<P>
But the Progressives' all-knowing vision seemed to crack and totter
after 1929.  The spiral into all-consuming depression could not
be managed;  the movement had failed.  But Progressive elite society
was unfazed by crisis.  It responded by turning on, and demonizing
the small-<I>c</I> conservatives among its own, those who had
run America since 1920.  And Herbert Hoover, master engineer,
became the gaunt-eyed icon of a vision that had failed because
of its conservatism.  The vision was not wrong; it had simply
not gone far enough.
<P>
Bad old Republican progressives had blown it because they let
the chaos of the market continue, but they <I>sinned</I> in believing
that private institutions could keep order and stability through
mere mediation.  It was not enough, the <I>Renewed Progressive</I>
said, for enlightened government just to regulate and advise;
 the state should intervene in the actual workings of society,
in order to insure progress and stay future catastrophe.
<P>
FDR did not bring revolution;  he found a way to renew peoples'
trust in the old elite -- <I>with a new face</I>.  His <I>Brain
Trust</I> borrowed the nicest-sounding tidbits from European social
democrats, but stayed true to the original Progressives' Presbyterian
patterns, especially the <I>noblesse oblige</I> part.  <I>Renewed
Progressives</I> wanted real government management of society,
but stopped short of advocating government ownership.  Their role
models were not gods nor fathers, but headmasters and ministers.
 The whole nation was their classroom and congregation.  They
would make things better -- manage industry right, give social
welfare to all, and coax an equality of outcome in American life
-- by preaching and instructing.
<P>
This elite makeover made sense to Americans.  Then world war actually
renewed emotional ties between people and their elites.  And World
War Two was a rip-snorting celebration of socialism.  The state
took over all our energies -- <I>they owned them!</I> -- for four
years, and they gave us a great adventure in return.  When Americans
came out into the sun and promises of peace, they gave FDR's brand
of progress their full faith and trust.
<P>
But there was no going back to the fervid installment consumerism
of the 1920s.  <I>Boy, but we could make!</I>  American workers
-- many of them women -- made everything world war demanded with
ease.  <I>And this</I> <I>with 12 million workers in uniform,
off the assembly lines</I>.  Recognition hit, at the moment of
the workers' world's biggest win, that the US was no longer for
workers only.
<P>
But we were still pretty creative:  we countered with a new class
of managers.  And a big new labor sector called &quot;management
services&quot; met two needs.  It allowed the economy to increase
total work, rather than rationing it <I>[meaning fewer jobs and
more social welfare]</I>, or reducing it <I>[meaning fractional
jobs for all].</I>
<P>
And much of this new work came with higher status.  This meant
that most millions of Americans could tie &quot;a better life
for our children&quot; to a promotion in <I>class</I>.  The GI
Bill made college the subsidized brass ring of the common man,
and college for all made us all <I>[eventually]</I> middle class.
 Upward mobility for all of us! What a concept!
<P>
This outward and upward expansion of labor unleashed a people
just past depression and war.  Full of pent-up demand for goods,
and, equally, full of pent-up expectations.  The elite had found
a way to meet them both.  Their seductive shibboleth:
<P>
<I>&quot;The American Dream.&quot;</I>
<P>
<CENTER><B>*.*.*.*.*</B></CENTER>
<P>
<br>
<br>
<center>
<I><B>&quot;Gee, Wally ...&quot;</B></I>
</center>
<P>
The new order worked like a big block <I>Chevy 454</I>.  And many
continued to believe that enlightened Government and the GI Bill,
had helped make it work.  In the 1950s and 60's, at belief's crest,
75% of Americans thought Government should help manage society.
<P>
LBJs <I>Great Society</I> was the floodtide of our faith in government.
<P>
What had been achieved?  The United States was no longer a worker's
world, it was now a middle class world.  In 1948, two-thirds of
Americans identified themselves as &quot;working class.&quot;
 By the 1960s, most said instead, &quot;middle class.&quot;  The
early TV sitcoms etched an indelible portrait of idealized American
life, a mythology now gathered under the collective mantle of
 <I>Leave It to Beaver</I>. [As nostalgic, <I>Nick at Nite</I>
Yuppies rush to embrace old sitcoms, they lay bare the same Old
Order reflex to revolution as Keats and Shelley lamenting a lost
countryside, or readers of <I>Tom Sawyer</I> and <I>Huckleberry
Finn</I> the demise of small town America].
<P>
People now lived in what academics would call <I>&quot;the mature
variation&quot;</I> of the industrial network of cities.  We called
it <I>suburbia</I>.  Auto and interstates made its sprawl possible,
and the sprawl itself made possible the big upstairs move in status
[for most].  The tract house and its passionste sidekick, the
white picket fence, was the campaign ribbon of a better life that
kept close people and their elites.
<P>
This was the third stage of urban America:  its life cramming
first into the strip shopping center, and then hitting its brief,
glittering zenith with <I>Edge City</I>, The Great American Mall.
 It is the place we still inhabit.  It is the mature end state
of classic industrial society.  It is a world that made room for
too-efficient manufacturing by creating a new management class
and service economy that soaked up the spilling excess of labor.
<P>
It all peaked around 1970.  That year, there were 40 million industrial-related
workers, only 2 million on the farm, and 38 million white collars
in America.
<P>
The new elites had brought order out of the chaos of industrialization.
 Their assembly line world worked.  First they rooted meaning
in the worker, then grafted on this social sod a middle class
world of management and services, living off its harvest.
<P>
Education and entertainment showed how well-oiled it all was.
 Education had become a machine designed to socialize and prepare
workers for an assembly line world, and managers for a world of
<I>pyramid-climbing</I>.  And new entertainment technologies were
harnessed to please and pacify.  Movies, radio, and television
-- unlike vaudeville and opera -- were based on a detached, objectified
relationship between artist and audience, and encouraged far more
passivity than traditional theaters.  And passive people make
controlling people very happy.
<P>
But now, no matter how smooth its control, the elite worried about
how to split up the still-shrinking pool of jobs.  And by jobs,
they meant <I>real</I> jobs.  And in industrial iconography, 
<I>real jobs</I> = <U>manufacturing</U>.  Real jobs would go away
because of -- dread word of that day -- <I>automation</I>.
<P>
This fear was an elite commonplace:  you could catch it in Kurt
Vonnegut's <I>Cat's Cradle</I>, or in high-tone, hard-back rags
like <I>Horizon</I>.  Look at Dennis Gabor's &quot;The Perils
of Leisure,&quot; from the Summer, 1964 issue -- the warm apogee
of the Great Society.  Productivity says Gabor, keeps growing
in the industrial world at a steady <I>x</I> percent, so high
that no social welfare spending can outpace it.  Eventually, said
the trendline, only the privileged would work.  The article's
substance, in fact, is in its opening cartoon, by David Levine.
 First, we see the bad old days, with working people in harness,
pulling a cigar-corpulent plutocrat on a wheeled palanquin.  Then,
we see tomorrow:  with happy mill workers playing cards on that
same, cushy float;  pulled now by three dapper, winking, Harvard
engineers.
<P>
The end of work itself was in sight:
<P>
<blockquote>
<I>For the first time in history we are now faced with the possibility
of a world in which only a gifted minority need work, to keep
the great majority in idle luxury.</I>
</blockquote>
<P>
This scene of the story ends here, in the mid-1960s, with elite
certainty that the engineering ethos -- managing the human condition
-- had triumphed.  The only problem they saw:  only the engineers
would have jobs.
<P>
But they were wrong.  Totally wrong.
<P>
How could they have been so far off the mark?
<P>
They took a straight line -- or like Gabor, just fondly cited
it as ever-truth -- and pushed it out.  All else stayed constant.
 What they overlooked, <I>or perhaps could not bring themselves
to believe</I>, was that human imagination itself was about to
change how the world worked.  New wealth and new jobs would be
created out of nothing:  <U><I>by creating new demand</I></U>.
 
<P>
This demand would be like the new demand created more than a century
before, at the beginning of industrial revolution.  The irony
for the now-aging elite was that their very success encouraged
innovation that would shake their world apart.  The Progressive
elites of late-20th century America made for themselves the same
predicament as the landed gentry of late-18th century Britain.
 Their wealth and ethos of improvement unwittingly set in train
the industrial revolution that would unseat them.
<P>
And this, Ladies and Gentlemen, is the roller-coaster of <I>our</I>
revolution heading toward its first plunge:
<P>
<I>The discovery of Byte City.</I>
<P>
<CENTER><B>*.*.*.*.*</B></CENTER>
<P>
<br>
<br>
<center>
<I><B>We've all heard a lot of talk about the Digital Age.</B></I>
<br><I><B>But what have we seen?</B></I>
<br><I><B>Here ends the hype ...</B></I>
<br><I><B>Television will never be the same again.</B></I>
<br><I><B>Enter the DSS system.</B></I>
<br><I><B>The DSS system will be on the cutting edge</B></I>
<br><I><B>  well into the next century.</B></I>
<br><I><B>--RCA ad, 1995</B></I>
</center>
<P>
&quot;Discovery&quot; means a burn-jump:  flash-link idea to technology.
 But we can't do that.  It's still too hard if Flashy ads can
trumpet TV [!!!] <I>as the future</I>.
<P>
<I><B>Humbug!</B></I>  We could demo the virtu-screen <I><B>&amp;</B></I>
Byte City <U>in five years</U>.
<P>
But maybe it doesn't matter whether we see, because we are stumbling
blind toward Byte City anyway through Big Money.  The coalitions
that will build Byte City have just been made.
<P>
And the big combos aren't waiting for the idea.  These are the
big alliances, the merging of corporate muscle in <I>tele-communications</I>
-- Bell South, Bell Atlantic, MCI -- with <I>entertainment </I>--
Disney, Time Warner -- with <I>software</I> -- Apple, Microsoft,
IBM -- and with the big <I>Cable</I> companies.  More than enough
to make <I>Byte City</I> happen ... when they finally figure it
out.
<P>
It doesn't matter that they are still fumbling with stagecoach
metaphors, when the railroad is waiting to be built.  It doesn't
matter that they still speak the language of <I>computer</I> and
<I>TV</I> and <I>telephone</I> and <I>Information Superhighway</I>
... when each one of these tools is poised on the crumbling edge
of historical oblivion.  It doesn't matter, because
<P>
Byte City, the rollercoaster rush to revolution, awaits, simply,
its own 
<P><I>Logos</I>, 
<br><B>The Word.</B>
<P>
The network of Byte Cities will be constructed on top of the on-line
services' road network that exists today.  We still think of <I>The
Net</I> as a communications mesh, but it is really a transportation
network.  It will be like the railroad of the last century because
it will do the same thing the railroads did to our lives.  But
instead of a physical locomotive, taking us to the city, the virtu-screen
will be a <I>virtual</I> engine, bringing the city to us.
<P>
We are only perhaps 20 years away from living, and working, in
the virtual public square of Byte City.  And when it hits us,
its power to entrance will be irresistible, but just as irresistibly,
it will disrupt the inherited rhythm of our lives.
<P>
Keep in mind that this will be nothing like looking at a television,
no matter how big the TV image gets.  Marshall McLuhan told us
that TV was a &quot;cool&quot; medium, because the screen was
always in the way, scratching at our emotional bond with the moving
imagery on it.  The interface was the emotional distance that
diminishes TV &quot;reality.&quot;
<P>
The wall-high virtu-screen parts ways with all of its vacuum-tube
progenitors because
<P>
<I>There is no interface.</I>
<P>
It is not only big like a movie screen, it has the picture fidelity
of life.  High-definition, digital imagery is <I>here</I>, but
the truly life-like is <I>there</I>, only a few years away.  You
will not hit the pavement of Byte City streets, but you will walk
the sidewalks none the less.
<P>
You will appear on those streets, visible to others, in a simulated
form:  a digital composite.  Most, surely, you will also appear
in slightly <I>[or highly!]</I> idealized form.  A whole service
niche will spring up, like the Pinkertons of the last century,
to verify that those we meet in Byte City are who they say they
are ... Countering <I>[of course!]</I> the artistry of an even
bigger new niche, the persona-<I>couturiers</I>;  from <I>haute</I>
to almost off-the-rack.
<P>
In fact, demand for a yet-unimagined range of services will surge
to meet the needs of this fabulous, overwhelming, new urban world.
 There will be so much to do, so much that one wants to do, that
our sense of <I>needs</I> will be wrestling with almost constant
redefinition.  Is it so different now?  <I>I <U>need</U> that
new computer?</I>  Really.  Just take that urge up an order of
magnitude.
<P>
You will work there, you will want to play there, you can do <I>[almost]</I>
everything there.  And each of the Byte Cities -- some big, some
very intimate -- will savagely compete for your time and your
precious subscription.
<P>
But one thing they will not compete for, one thing they will all
strive actively to assuage, will be the eventual <I>anomie</I>
they spread, seeping into our spirits even as we work and cavort
in the cool, passionate swirl of neon and gilded <I>chiaroscuro</I>.
<P>
Because it will change the way we relate to people.  Think about
it:  If you can meet with anyone, anywhere, any time, interact
with them, do anything with them -- immediately, intimately, but
<I>virtually</I> -- the potential for initial social disruption
is as great as that visited on the flood of urban migrants to
the brick cities of smokestacks and furnaces that scarred England
two centuries ago.
<P>
Those cities physically threw people together.  Our revolution
will also throw people together, but the impact of intimacy --
for work or play -- without barriers of time and space, will stretch
and stress our social patterns to the limit.
<P>
How will it do this?  Let's look at three torquings of necessary
intimacy:
<P>
<pre>
<CENTER><I><B>Sports   		Speech    		Sex</B></I></CENTER>
</pre>
<P>
<CENTER><B>*.*.*.*.*</B></CENTER>
<P>
<br>
<br>
<CENTER><I><B>Sports</B></I></CENTER>
<P>
keep us tribally blooded.  Not with the band, out for the hunt,
but in a theater of its training.  Sports is our ritual connection
to the tribe working together for survival, seeking great elk
kills.  Sports takes us back to origins, keeping our oldest identity
alive.
<P>
But sports changes to fit new worlds of work.  And sports is not
like work, sports is not for work.  Sports gives us things that
new worlds of work take away.  So when mill and assembly line
made us stand all day, sports let us sit down.  Baseball is America's
industrial sport, the theater that let a tired worker sit down
in the cool evening, have a beer, and watch them play ball.. 
Watching is as important as playing;  they are both equal parts
of the ritual sharing, because in a mass society, if the hunt
is to be tribally shared, the theater must encompass all.  Hence
the 100,000 Bowl, a stadium for the whole <I>polis</I>;  or <I>Monday
Night Football</I>, for the biggest tribe of all.  <I>Nation</I>
meant tribe for the Romans, and nation came from the verb, <I>to
be born</I>.
<P>
But Byte City forces us to get outside and play.  Now we work
in our own cells, we labor without moving, we sweat virtually.
 That vast virtu-screen becomes our master, we long for escape.
 Our urge to feel the primitive overwhelms us.  Forget baseball,
football, basketball, all the ball-pushing million-dollar heroes
do for us -- we want to get out.  Today, in places like Moab,
Utah, yuppie precursors of the new world of work sit all day in
front of their vacuum tubes, longing for the five-hour, four-wheel
drive that will take them to some wind-scarred escarpment where
they can hang-glide, or kayak-surf, or snowboard to within a fingernail's
proximity of themselves, the once-Magdelian hunter, in that very
place, an elk and a glacier ago.
<P>
<br>
<CENTER><I><B>Speech</B></I></CENTER>
<P>
is more than how we talk.  It's about the identity we get from
how we talk.  Old Order types talk in writing, and they lament
what they call the end of literacy.  Whining:  <I>When people
stop writing, the greatest glory of human expression will die,
and with it, the heart of civilization itself.</I>
<P>
But the death of Old Order writing is the rebirth of our language.
 The death prose we now call <I>the written word</I> was once
alive with current.  When Samuel Johnson bleu stronge with so
grayte a noyse, written English was vital, rich, hot-blooded.
 We didn't even know how to spell until well into the 19th century:
<P>
Until well into the industrial era.  After the revolution.  The
new elites may have brought order, but they also brought formality,
control.  Over the last century, the enlightened elite wrung the
spirit out of language.  Bureaucrats made rigid the written word,
larded it with rules, a bid to control thought itself.  In industrial
end-times, <I>Elitespeak</I> is unreadable.  <I>Elitespeak</I>
is not for giving a message; it is for hiding it.  It is <I>anti-language</I>.
<P>
But now, as we lose our &quot;literacy,&quot; we liberate our
tongues.  New ways of telling fit new values to be told, all spoken
in a new place.  And telling it affirms what we are, as it overturns
what we are not.  So as we speak the truth, song returns to speech.
 And as we make new landscape heroic in virtual expanse, we come
back to Homeric, Hip-Hop cadence.  New language, new connection,
new message.
<P>
<br>
<CENTER><I><B>Sex</B></I></CENTER>
<P>
is to society what C4 is to civil engineering:  it is elemental
both to creation and to destruction.  That is why all cultures
work hard to harness sex, to make it celebrate and reinforce society
... because it also has the power to tear away at it.  Modern
lore remembers two tearing times:  the libertine French Revolution
[as in <I>Marat-Sade</I>:  &quot;What's the use of a revolution
without general copulation?&quot;], and the more widespread wildfire
of &quot;liberated,&quot; pre-AIDS America:  1790s, 1970s.  Neither
lasted long.
<P>
Byte City does not promote uncontrolled sex, it merely removes
the controls.  Remember, you can meet anyone, anywhere, anytime.
 And whatever you do is free of consequences.  Byte City's most
obvious limitation is also its biggest draw:  you can't actually
touch anyone, so no one gets hurt. <I> Physically</I>.  Old style,
uncontrolled sex meant a river of consequences:  unwanted births,
incurable diseases, collateral crimes aplenty, and marital mayhem.
 None of these would attain in <I>Byte City</I>, the ultimate
terminus of protected, vicarious, unbridled sex.
<P>
No culture has ever been offered such a painless feast.  No culture
has ever had its ethos so tested.  Culture controls sex by linking
it indissoluably to love.  Promiscuity requires cruel manipulation
of others while zeroing out love;  even in a society where sex
is available, only a few can sustain the drain on persona that
promiscuity demands.  Byte City's sexual <I>smorgasbord</I> makes
no such demands.
<P>
Everybody can do it:  we feel no pain, no pain is inflicted, identity
is hidden, and fantasex is limited only by mind and by byte.
<P>
But there is a fee.  This is real sex, and there will be consequences.
 How overwhelming?  Look at the constant pushing of the envelope
in on-line sex right now;  but this is nothing to the pulsing
explosion to come.  Baroque paraphernalia will be like quaaludes
in the high-quest:  virtual reality armor and implants, real-time
video changelings for digital personae, and wild, wild metamorphoses.
<P>
Morph sex itself will stretch us, in the end, back to ourselves.
 At that final limit, so far beyond what physical sex restrains,
the very terror we will feel will be in our own reflection;  in
what we have become.
<P>
<CENTER><B>*.*.*.*.*</B></CENTER>
<P>
<br>
<br>
<I><B>And</B></I> the free-wheeling, almost frontier spirit of
Byte City will push the <I>coming apart</I> we all feel is tearing
at American society.  When historians look back on this period,
perhaps they will shake their heads, thinking the clich&eacute;
of all historians:  <I>Couldn't they see it?  It was so obvious:
 the breakdown in family life, the 60% illegitimacy rates of the
early 1990s ... these were just the heralds of things to come?</I>
<P>
But people feel what is coming, even if their elite officially
denies it.  The elite denies by redefining the <I>tsunami</I>
to suit its own needs, even as the wave rises over them:  <I>A
changing labor force?  We can solve that with another federal
jobs retraining program</I>.  People are more honest;  they feel
the revolution's rumble in their guts.
<P>
Because they know the comfort of mature industrial times, the
apparent orderliness of a work force half-maker, half-manager,
has been eroding away for two decades.  But the erosion doesn't
stop;  it accelerates.  The industrial world is going away.
<P>
What does work -- and the identity work brings -- look like in
Byte City?
<P>
Say we end up in this world by 2020.  Byte City -- the new economy
-- will live on ideas.  If ideas are really the currency, if ideas
are really what make things happen, then <I>making it</I> will
be even more meritocratic than it is now.
<P>
It won't be enough to have a college degree from Yale and announce:
 <I>I'm Wolf's Head, <U>cum laude</U>, make me a Foreign Service
Officer</I> -- or some other bureaucratic lifestyle slot.  Or
-- <I>I rate a fat niche on the corporate pyramid at IBM</I>.
 No.  All job worth must be proven in Byte City.  Only a very
few will make it to the ether either ... and Murray's <I>Bell
Curve</I> won't be the best litmus test for their success.  I.Q.
measures what's in the box, but <B>Brain Lords</B> are made by
going out of the box.  That's what Byte City will thrive on, and
that's why they are the great winners, initially, in this world.
<P>
Brain Lords are not like the Robber Barons, nor their enlightened
engineer successors, the <I>Brain Trust</I>.  They are not empire-builders,
like Carnegie, nor do they wish to be managers of millions, like
Ira Magaziner.  Their goal is not control of others.  They seek
realization within their persons, like ancient heroes:  where
their brain power is like the strength and speed of Achilles.
 Tom Wolfe called them, wryly,<I> &quot;Masters of the Universe.&quot;</I>
 Milken, Gates, Spielberg:  they are the Achilles of Smart.
<P>
Yet the brain lords will not represent a heritable class.  They
will make it as individuals, and most of them will make it only
for a brief time.  Burn-out will be their limiting factor.  Like
their prototypes today in entertainment and the media, they will
use up their personal capital quickly.  The top job niche will
emphasize golden parachutes aplenty, with more relaxing work to
follow a forties' retirement.
<P>
Still successful, still needed, will be the <B>Upper Server</B>
society.  Lawyers and doctors will still make big money, but their
top echelon status will be undercut by a wholly new job persona:
 the Agent.
<P>
<B>Agents </B>will be the individual entrepreneur class, those
who offer tailored information services -- including law and medicine
and education! -- in Byte City.  Many in what we still call &quot;the
professions&quot; will squat in this niche.  The rising class
of personal information-providers and navigators will put real
downward social pressure on doctors and lawyers and academics,
because agents will get you -- or take you to -- the knowledge
you need, without a defilingly expensive appointment with the
almighty.
<P>
And maybe 10 percent of the workforce stays in production, whether
it's growing food or whether it's making things.  And they will
form a sort of upper tier themselves.  Because of the highly specialized
skills required to be a new manufacturer, <B>Makers</B> will usually
be part owners of their firms.
<P>
So say about 25 percent are doing well, very well.  And, given
the corrosion and damage to the young in illegitimate and single-parent
households today;  tomorrow's labor force will include a bottom,
an underclass, also about 25%.  This, tragically, will be double
the population share of those discarded in the bad old industrial
era.  These are <B>The Lost</B>;  and in revolutionary times,
societies have shown little inclination to find them.
<P>
And they can be sustained, as they are now, by the great wealth
unlocked by Byte City.  They can be sustained, but they can't
be ignored.  Those who bring order from the chaos of things to
come, those who come after us, will very likely make the rediscovery
of the lost their great task, just as the Victorians and the Progressives
in their day sought out the poor.
<P>
But what will the rest of us, the 50 percent in the middle, the
bedrock of the industrial world's great &quot;Middle Class;&quot;
 the true believers in &quot;The American Dream;&quot;  <I>what
will we do?</I>
<P>
Old Order, New Deal elitists still think that there won't be anything
to do.  Jeremy Rivkin's new book, <I>The End of Work</I>, rehashes
the old lie of the engineer class:  there is only so much that
can be produced, so as the work force gets more productive, there
will be fewer and fewer jobs.  And eventually, there won't be
any work anymore.  Let us, the enlightened engineers of the elite,
apportion work <I>equitably</I> [meaning:  <I>as we see fit</I>].
<P>
We know <I>[Oh! How we know!]</I> that this just isn't true. 
The mountainous evidence is everywhere about us.  Demand creates
wealth;  the industrial revolution created a whole new universe
of demand.  Look at the personal computer.  <I>Demand=Wealth</I>;
 created out of nothing, out of the thin air of an idea!
<P>
There will be plenty of jobs in Byte City.
<P>
There will be plenty of money.  The question is:  What status
will these jobs have?  Of all the old badges, the four-year college
degree will be the most worthless.  People still think:  <I>I
have a college degree, I can be in middle management and rise
to the top if I'm good; I can do it</I>.  That is the motivational
mythology of the industrial age.  It is a blind guide to tomorrow.
<P>
Work in Byte City is all about service.  And the bulk of work
will be in maintenance, sales, support, and delivery.  Like video
game advisors, telling you how to get through <I>Donkey Kong in
Paris</I>, or getting you those perfect tomato cubes from the
Safeway <I>Casbah </I>local warehouse, or showing you wares in
the Woolworth Palace in Mainstreet, USA, or fixing a damaged local
fiber optic line for an Opreyville subscriber, or working up a
new simulated persona for a customer who wants to make a splash
as Conan in <I>Dirty</I> <I>Rita's Party Place</I>.
<P>
A chilling possibility is this comeback of service.  But that
trend today is in full flood.  At least in Byte City, most of
us are serving each other.
<P>
The problem -- <I>always</I> -- is status.  Like those new workers
in the early industrial era, those in the mills and furnaces were
not offered the status of the craftsman they replaced.  They were
pushed to the limit, because there were no limits yet defined.
 They were abused because their undefined status did not culturally
protect them.
<P>
We, the majority, the 50 percent who will make Byte City work,
will go to work in our living rooms <I>[or even, closeted in our
bedrooms]</I> before the big screen, and we will suffer much the
same stripping of self as that majority entering the Midlands
milltowns of 1820 or the East Side sweatshops of 1880.  Already
Americans are working longer and longer hours.  Can you imagine
-- with &quot;<I>global competition&quot;</I> as the excuse --
people in Byte City standing in front of their screens, working
their customers, 12, 15 hours a day?  And with an end to commuting
for many, the Brain Lords will say, S<I>o much the more time to
work</I>.  <I>And you're working at home, right?</I>
<P>
So all this talk about class is upsetting?  Americans don't like
the word:  the elite don't want to be likened to Euristocrats;
 the rest of us don't want to be reminded that The People are
not in charge.  Or maybe just that we didn't <I>make it</I>.
<P>
Class in America is always there, and it rises right to the surface
of our thinking during Big Change.  Why?  Because those driving
change also seize its opportunities.  While old elites topple
and gutter-slide, the new are in chic media worship.  They are
<U>what's happening</U>, we are <U>what is done <I>to</I></U>.
 So while our lives are in free fall, they float, majestically,
in the ether of the new world.
<P>
But what we will see as the new class won't have any of its ancestors'
levers of control.  First it was land, then commodities, then
&quot;the means of production.&quot;  In this this century it
has been knowledge.  The mature industrial world was run by bureaucratic
machine.  And what was that?  It was a pyramid of professionals,
managers, engineers:  these were the noble titles of the twentieth
century's equestrian order of knowledge.  Control of knowledge
was power, and access to knowledge was carefully controlled.
<P>
No one will control knowledge in Byte City.  The new class will
only appear to us as swaggering Brain Lords; we will assume that
they are the new masters of the universe, Robber Barons reborn.
 Their moment will be even more evanescent than in industrial
times.  After the Big Change, when it all shakes down, Byte City
may be a place for Big Men, but not for Lords.  But during the
rollicking, roughshod rollercoaster wavetime, the Brain Lords
will be the riders of the transformation, the ones scoring big,
the arrogant makers and high rollers.  And because they are the
first to benefit big from the revolution, while its impact is
still crashing down on us, we will vent on them.
<P>
Because we will identify the new elites with the whole change,
<I>bad and good</I>.  And because they break the old but then
themselves do not lead, we at last despise them.  We flock to
their network, but then, as we live and work there, Byte City
becomes ours:  a public square, a community of many neighborhoods.
 And we will want a different vision of life in this place.
<P>
So the time will come, soon after the network is built, when we
will, as those before us, demand new meaning.
<P>
And we will find it along two paths unexpectedly familiar:  politics,
and religion.
<P>
The industrial world threw people together.  Their physical closeness,
<I>en masse</I>, allowed people to mobilize politically <I>en
masse</I>.  And they did.  And that was the birth of mass, plebiscitary
democracy.
<P>
But Byte City lets us escape the faceless experience of mass democracy.
 People today are rejecting machine politics because they sense
that the new tools of social connection, the very tools that will
soon fuse into Byte City, will give them the voice to speak decisively
in all decision-making;  and not, this time, in instant mass telephony
-- button-pushing robot Perotistas -- <U>but through thousands
of interest groups and factions.</U>
<P>
Byte City returns us to politics as The Founders meant it to be.
 But politics then -- <I>say, in 1800</I> -- were for a few thousands
of Americans only.  Byte City will let millions of civically motivated
citizens meet, and caucus, and <I>politick</I>:  anywhere, anytime.
<P>
And they will demand directly.  We can only marvel in advance
at the political turbulence that lies in wait.  <I>What will we
do with all those factions?</I>
<P>
Because Americans want unity too.  They want that mythic togetherness,
like a Raoul Walsh war film or a John Ford western 
<P>
<I>Around her neck, she wore a yellow ribbon,</I>
<br>
<I>She wore it in the springtime, and in the month of May,</I>
<br>
<I>And when I asked her, why the hell she wore it,</I>
<br>
<I>She wore it for her sweetheart in the US Cavalry ...</I>
<P>
American togetherness is slipping away.  Where can it be found
again?
<P>
Maybe in our search for meaning in Faith.  Byte City will open
up new communities of faith as we struggle with disorder in our
lives, and especially, a fracturing of how we relate to others.
 Byte City will redefine words like <I>temptation</I>, <I>abandonment</I>,
<I>anomie</I>.  What will be the basis for connection, for commitment?
 To whom will we owe allegiance, in whom can we repose our trust?
<P>
Byte City's very nature brings a breaking-down of secular society.
<P>
And out of the rootlessness and freaky chaos will come religious
revivals.  But they will not emerge from the Old Order <I>Mainline</I>
Churches -- <I>those bastions of the elite</I> -- nor from the
Evangelical patent-leather bureaucracies that have risen to such
estate in recent years.
<P>
Why <I>patent-leather</I>?  Because to fight the elite society
of the modern state, elite evangelicals organized themselves on
the same lines.  They learned the same machine politics, and they
crafted an agenda of state control.  This time, their state. 
They became the very Church their own prophets had once fled from.
 They became the very image of the thing they fought against.
 Now their <I>tele-ministries</I> and <I>coalitions</I> are full
partners in the Old Order landscape of squabbling necropoli.
<P>
<I>Cities of the Dead</I>.  The new cities are coming, and with
them, a maw of <I>anomie</I>.  The new revival will come as a
calling:  of people rising up.  It will be the evangelism that
meets spiritual crisis head-on, that is witnessed in the new wilderness
by those who speak the truth and give good news.  And the message
will meet the times.  It will not look backward, like the anti-progressive
Old Order, to some nostalgic golden age that we can get back to
if only we have the right regulatory structure, or pass the right
laws, or ... 
<P>
The next <I>Great Awakening</I> will happen in Byte City itself.
 Maybe many sects, hot competition, fighting over their skyrocketing
convert-count.  Yet chances are that it will rise from the grassroots
Of Catholic and Protestant evangalism, like Methodism did two
centuries ago.  And maybe like Methodism, a single vision will
sweep over us.  But the revival itself will meet a great wave
of national emotion.  And [<I>when it comes</I>] its talk will
be the center of our search for new American life.
<P>
[<I>Important!  It won't look like any ad on today's Religion
page!</I>]
<P>
That is why <I>how</I> Methodism came to Britain is what we need
to know, not that it was <I>Methodist</I>.  It came.  We need
to know why it came, because we are in for the same ride.  The
cultural paradox for us at the end of <I>The Modern</I> is that
religion didn't go away.  It's going to be more important.  Just
different.  And whatever it looks like, how we find faith will
be a big part of the way we join hands civically as Americans.
<P>
And what we demand, and how we demand it, will determine who rises
to give demand leadership and vision.  We can say with certainty
that it cannot come from the dying old order:  both deathbed <I>New
Dealers</I> and but slightly less moribund <I>New Democrats</I>.
 And we suspect that it will<U><I> not</I></U> come from the cocky
Brain Lords who build Byte City <I>[but we need them to build
it!].</I>
<P>
But we should know that the Brain Lords <I>will </I>build it,
and that it <I>will</I> change our lives forever.  We know further,
in spite of Social Democracy's sentimental gurglings, that the
future cannot be managed, nor its reality held back.
<P>
But we should comfort ourselves in the knowledge also that these
things have happened before.  Others survived their time of stress,
dislocation, and <I>anomie</I>.  Britain made it through its crisis
to a world that would later be enshrined by us [in <I>Sherlock
Holmes</I>, <I>Upstairs, Downstairs</I>] as among the best of
good times.  And the United States made it through its crisis
to a similar happy place in the American mind [in <I>Meet Me in
St. Louis, Easter Parade</I>].  Crisis was succeeded by a spirit
of confidence and of hope, and a reassertion of the inevitability,
and ultimate good, of Progress.
<P>
<I>How will it happen?  How will we get to these good times?</I>
<P>
That's another story.

<h2><I><B>The War After Byte City</B></I> </h2>
<P>
by <a href="/pff/people/sfellow.html#Vlahos">Michael Vlahos</a>
<PRE>
It was the greatest military power of its day.
Always the innovator, its technologies of war
		were the newest,
Its command &amp; control the best of the best.
Its ability to mobilize national resources
		was matchless,
Its traditions the envy and admiration of all;
And surely, imitated by all.
It was the world's military superpower,
And it owned war.

But now peace was everywhere.
Its great armies, mobilized for decades,
		were drawn down
What had been the center of grand strategy,
		the cockpit: Central Europe,
Was now a portrait of like-minded states.

So the great nation refocused,
Turning its military toward new roles.
It built a mobile deterrent force:
A rapidly deployable army that could be rushed
To quell a regional contingency (or two!),
		and restore stability.
It reshaped its military forces
Around a core, professional force,
That could be used flexibly to achieve
		the larger, strategic goal:
The preservation of a stable world system.


Of course, I describe France in 1860.
</PRE>
<P>
But there is something familiar there for us. Like France then,
we are today's <I>grande nation</I>. And we have been there for
awhile in this American century. Like France then, American culture
has set world fashion, and our English is the world language.
And we too seem set now in a long peace.
<P>
Does a passing historical resemblance tell us anything about the
future of our own national security, or the future of war itself?
And if France may have been, like us, the military superpower
of that era: <I>they were the defeated superpower in 1815.</I>

<P>
True. Yet in the long peace after the wars of Napoleon, France
regained a military preeminence only briefly lost at Waterloo.
By 1860, France again seemed astride the earth like a god of war:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Who wrote the doctrine of war everyone used? Henri Jomini.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Who was the innovator: The first breechloading rifle - the
<I>Chassepot</I> - the first shell gun - the <I>Paixhans</I> -
the first machine gun - the <I>Mitrailleuse</I> - the first ironclad
battleship - the <I>Gloire</I>?
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Whose army had real global reach? With successful offensive
&amp; peacekeeeping operations just recently concluded in Spain,
Italy, Algeria, the Crimea, and soon, even Mexico too?
</UL>
<P>
France in mid-century was a world power, using its military power
to balance and manage world order. France was pledged to preserving
a world system and nearly fifty years of stability. Like the US
today, France in 1860 was the <I>status quo</I> power ...
<P>
In a world where the <I>status quo</I>, stability, and the old
system itself ... Was about to end.
<P>
<I>And end they would in a big bang for France.</I> 
<P>
Ten years later, the <I>grande nation</I> would begin an historical
reeling from which it would never recover. War with the German
Federation would humiliate the French, destroy their reputation
for war forever, and end also their long certainty of national
greatness. <B>1</B> 
<P>
This could never happen to us. <I>Of course not</I>. Like all
analogies, this one is imperfect, and in mixing military metaphors,
manipulative even. <I>Of course</I>. But as different as they
are, two times and two peoples and two ways of war, France then
and the US now share the same strategic problem.
<P>
Big Change.
<P>
France didn't lose in 1871 because it was stupid or unlucky. Certainly,
its war technologies and combat experience were superior to Germany's.
<P>
France lost in 1871 because a revolution had swept Europe. And
that revolution changed war. But the French military and their
ruling national elites had not kept up. They had missed the revolution
in war.
<P>
But if you could go back to 1860 and tell this to French ruling
elites, they would be offended. They would protest: <I> &quot;We
have the world's most modern military machine. Look at our record
of innovation: superior French science and engineering has changed
the face of war!&quot; </I>And so everyone thought. You could
see it in every newspaper - just look at Daumier's grisly cartoon,
<I>Triumph of the Needle Gun. </I>New gun, new ship, new war.
<P>
If you went back and talked about a revolution in war, people
would nod their heads. <I>Yes, there is a revolution: the ironclad
revolution at sea, and the breechloading rifle - Chassepot and
Needle Gun - on land. Yes. These are revolutionary weapons</I>.
<P>
Everyone thought that revolutions in war are about new weapons.
<P>
But it was the big change in ordinary life, the life of people
in society, that had changed war. The new artifacts of daily life
were the bringers of revolution in war ... Like the railroad.
The railroad was the tool of Europe's transformation, the agent
at the heart of industrial revolution. The railroad had brought
whole pastoral worlds to the new cities of brick and iron.
<P>
And the railroad could also bring whole age cohorts of young men
to the new killing grounds of the needle gun. Between 1815 and
1870, industrial society created industrial war: war by mobilization,
war by train timetable. But in 1860, that war had not yet been
fought. It was still theory in the mind of Moltke. New war had
been enabled, but not enacted. France's elites were free for a
while yet to pursue old wars with modern cosmetics, wars still
won by quick offensive maneuver and long-service veterans, without
apprehension that this way of war was already dead.
<P>
And they could still believe the future of war was theirs: as
long as they stayed ahead of all others in weapons' technology,
and kept their warrior ethos stoked hot. There were no worries
here.
<P>
<B>This is the point of comparison:</B> 
<P>
We are in the midst of an economic upheaval equivalent to the
industrial revolution <I>in its capacity to transform our lives</I>.
And like the industrial revolution, this metamorphosis will reach
up to politics and to war, and remake them as well.
<P>
But America's ruling elites have defined a world system that does
not allow for the possibility of Big Change. Like the French plutocrats
of the 1850s, the old, Cold War establishment is pledged to preserve
the old paradigm at all costs. They define the US as the <I>status
quo</I> power, their sacred word is <I>stability</I>, and their
imperative verb is <I>to manage</I>.
<P>
And the military component of this ruling class sees American
military power as the ultimate world management tool. War is defined
as combat operations in pursuit of stability. Some in the national
security sub-culture talk quietly about a revolution in war. But
they describe this revolution like the French military innovators
of the 1850s: a revolution in weapons.
<P>
<B>This, then, is the hypothesis:</B> 

<P><UL>
<LI>The world economic revolution is true Big Change: what old
German philosophers would call a <I>phenomenon of world-historical
significance</I>. As it transforms individual societies across
the world, it changes the very patterns of relationship between
societies - what we call the world system. And so economic revolution
changes the world system as well as the world's societies. But
here, change comes first as systemic breakdown. New norms - perhaps
a new system - will evolve later.
</UL>
<P>

<UL>
<LI>Economic revolution will bring upheaval to world cultures
as old ways of life are torn apart. Upheaval will encourage new
belief systems, as people seek new meaning out of the shock of
Big Change. But change will hit different peoples in different
ways. Culture and environment will shape different demand for
new meaning around the world. New bodies of meaning that arise
- whether we call these religions or ideologies - will look different,
act different, and, most important, see big differences between
each other. New differences will lead to new human conflict.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>New war will serve the needs of new meaning. And the new ideologies
and religions born of economic revolution will use the new tools
of revolution to win. Industrial war used the new tools of railroad
and telegraph, assembly line and spreadsheet to serve the war
visions of the new ideologies: mass democracy and its competing
<I>-isms</I>. New war will be as determined, and as opportunistic.
And new meaning will have no ties to old war.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>But we, the <I>status quo</I> power, greatest of the old powers,
will not only still be fighting old war, we will still be <I>thinking</I>
old war. The successful bureaucracies of old war will continue
to refight old victories, and continue to dress future combat
in the cool desert camo of far battles long won. And we will still
have the world's best high-tech, and our people will have the
combat experience and the military professionalism. But our mythic
reputation, first built on a good war fought eight or nine decades
ago, will be both our glory and our curse.
</UL>

<P>
And we will await our Sedan.
<P>
Let's look at this bundled hypothesis point-by-point.
<P>

<I><B>A Time of Upheaval</B></I> 
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>Discontinuous Change a Surprise to US</I> 
</UL>

<P>
Of all world cultures, America believes in the sacredness of progress.
We like to say that this has been <I>A Century of Progress</I>:
meaning, by implication, that progress is a gradual, incremental
thing, accommodating itself to the world it finds, changing it
in polite if not always comfortable ways, giving us time to familiarize
ourselves with the new. Every wrench has been buffered by its
careful insertion into our lives. We didn't jump from Vaudeville
to color TV. It took decades.
<P>
Yet this is not a time of progress. Rather, it is a time of revolution.
Change, instead of stretching the fabric of reality, is about
to rip the canvas. But we are not prepared to see revolution for
what it is.
<P>
Part of our problem is that we have disarmed our own language.
In our vision of progress, we have used the word <I>revolution</I>
as a commonplace. It has been used as an accent, a spicing for
product debuts: Television was a revolution, the Atomic Bomb was
a revolution; and so the jet plane, then the VCR, Dolby sound,
and the microwave oven. These were products that amplified, and
altered, our lives, but in no way did any of them fundamentally
change our <I>way of life</I>.
<P>
We have forgotten what revolution is. And we are about to be reminded.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>The Second Surprise: It's Our Own Doing</I> 
</UL>

<P>
The Big Change isn't happening out there. We are making it happen
right here. We are bringing discontinuous change to ourselves.
<P>
The US, the premiere <I>status quo</I> power, is now that very
<I>status quo</I>'s undoing. We are the dynamic force actively
dismantling the old paradigm, the old world system,
<P>
<B>We are the system breaker.</B> 
<P>
<I>How's that?</I> 
<P>
We are the makers of revolution, like Britain's self-made industrial
revolution of the last century. We are bringing the new railroad
to American life, and like the railroad, our new net will transform,
first our lives, and then the life of the world.
<P>
As the railroad created a new network of cities and an urban,
industrial society, so this new network <I>[or the net after the
net after today's worldwide web] </I>that we are laying will replace
the urban, industrial world with a new city, a new gathering place
for American life <I>[what I call]</I> 
<P>
<B>Byte City.</B> 
<UL>
<LI><I>What does this mean?</I> 

<P>
<center><i>It means this for American business, and the American way of
life:</i> </center>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>There will be no distance - as well as no time - to transactions.
This happening now <I>[don't even ask!].</I> 
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>And there will be no distance, no time barriers as well to
meeting and working in Byte City. You will be able to meet anyone,
anywhere, anytime, with the fidelity of digitized life. It won't
be video-conferencing, and it won't require headgear.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>There will be a new standard of value, defined by the marketplace.
People will set value for knowledge. Directly, person-to-person.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The pressure for openness and transparency of transaction
will be absolute.
</UL>
</ul>
<P>
And this makes a new economy, built on knowledge services.
<br>
There is an explosion of productivity.
<br>
There is a whole new workforce.
<br>
And work takes on wholly new patterns <I>[commuting dies, for
example].</I> 
<P>
It is a new way of life for most Americans.
<P>
But there is also an end to the old workforce, and to the old
job ways, the old rhythms of life built around manufacturing,
and the servicing of the machine.
<P>
This means dislocation, anxiety, fear of the future.
<br>
And this is happening right now.
<P>
But it will get much worse.
<br>
Many will do very well in this new world, as they are right now,
<br>
But many will not.
<P>
We are in the beginning of an upheaval the likes of which we have
never known. Nor have our parents, nor theirs, nor theirs.
<P>
<CENTER><i>It means this for American politics:</i> </CENTER>
<P>
The last Big Change overthrew not just regular people's way of
life, but how all life was organized. How whole countries were
ruled. As millions of Americans find themselves in the fearful,
rollicking slide of Big Change, stripped of old meaning, they
will demand new meaning:
<P>
<blockquote>
<I>What is my status in society? How do I belong? What is my worth?
What kind of life can I expect for my family, what kind of future
for my children?</I> 
</blockquote
<P>
These questions, when asked collectively, will tear apart American
politics as we have known it. More exactly, the surge of change
will spell the end of the New Deal, Cold War elite, already under
siege. The world they still represent will have nothing to say
about <I>The Change</I>, but all of it will be seen to have failed.
<P>
And the technologies of the new net, of the not-yet-apprehended
<I>Byte City</I>, will make it possible for regular Americans
so long disenfranchised by machine politics and plebiscitary democracy
to gather and talk and act. Not to nominate petty demagogues,
for they will need no telegenic spokesmen: but to move, to speak,
to be felt directly: as groups of citizens.
<P>
Economic revolution transforms the US economy. Like the last revolution,
this change increases everyone's wealth, but not everyone's happiness.
The stress of social adaptation will mean a protracted period
of inward-turning by America. For as economic revolution liberates
great national energies, these passions unleashed demand resolution.
Like America after the Civil War, there will be very little energy
to spare for the rest of the world ...
<P>
Except that the revolution itself becomes our connection. What
we create here creates demand there. Everyone wants it; it is
the spellbinding new world, the promise of a better life for billions
still tied to sweatshop and factory, and silver billions' more
for elites that can bring its wonders home.
<P>
Like Britain then, we export the agent of transformation: our
new city high on that hill in cyberspace. And the violence of
our Big Change crashes and redoubles itself on them.
<P>

<I><B>How Big Change hits the world</B></I> 
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>The cultural dissonance of revolution</I> 
</UL>

<P>
There are reasons why we might expect that our economic revolution
will hit others harder than it hits us.
<P>
The forms of our revolution, as they are developed, tend to fit
our cultural norms and belief system. America is a chaotic culture;
it likes chaos, and even more important, it thrives on chaos.
Apparent chaos. Beneath the spectacle others see of us, there
is the same working pattern here of human culture everywhere:
custom and taboo keep us all in line.
<P>
But the<I> Byte City</I> spectacle will alternately thrill and
repel other cultures. It will thrill individuals with its seemingly
infinite possibilities. It will threaten their ruling classes
in their guts.
<P>
The new economy the US is building directly attacks the entrenched
hierarchies of the industrial world. Pseudo-democratic elites
whose rule depends on control of information will be confounded
by the absolute transparency of <I>Byte City</I>. A social welfare
system jointly created by elites and manufacturing workers cannot
be sustained in an economy where value is determined, not by job
status, and time in job, but directly: by what one actually offers
the new marketplace.
<P>
This means that the elaborate industrial paradigms of Europe and
Japan cannot long survive the advent of <I>Byte City</I> on their
ether's shores. But neither, given American market intimacy, and
the intimate demand of their own people, can it be kept out.
<P>
The problem is in adjustment. The US has already adjusted to structural
dismantling of manufacturing society. The US has made the big
investment in the new enterprises of revolution. And the US carries
much less of a social welfare overhead than the G-7's other six.
<P>
But consider the EC. In each European society, more than 50% of
GNP goes to government. This means that majority support for the
welfare state is built in. But keeping their social welfare world
means squeezing the productive sectors: in France, marginal tax
on business was just increased from 85% to 93%! Yet even this
would still work if there were enough productive enterprises to
sustain the overhead. European economies need the new enterprises
of the revolution, but these are so regulated that they have been
strangled almost to death. Just some stats. EC GNP equals the
US, but

<P>
Europeans buy US knowledge products and knowledge services: the
EC runs an $18 billion trade deficit with the US in software.
Smart Europeans who want to save on long distance call a service
in Oklahoma that places their <I>European</I> calls: they save
up to 50% that way. They are becoming parasites of America's revolution.
<P>
Europe's elites still believe that high value-added manufacturing,
like Mercedes and Italian shoes, can finance the industrial welfare
state. But there are no jobs there, and only so much value-added.
The real value-added is here: in the US, 50% of new capital investment
goes to electronics and information systems; in semi-conductors
alone, value in terms of total capital investment shot up from
7% in 1990, to 23% today.
<P>
Right now, real unemployment in Germany is close to 30%, the truth
masked by so many unemployed percentage points stashed in perpetual
job-training programs: Forty days guaranteed vacation cannot fig-leaf
a job world that rations work. In France, where unemployment is
officially 13%, the reality is also closer to a third - if the
marginally employed are counted. New French folklore fastens on
the numbers of <I>three-generation </I>families who have never
held a job.
<P>
As it barrels into this world, America's economic revolution brings
social revolution. The stratified industrial economies of Europe
and Japan - <I>[yes, Japan; 87% of Japanese workers are in globally
uncompetitive companies that receive some form of government subsidy]
</I>-<I> </I>are not prepared for the trauma that we are even
now bringing to them. The old, developed world is as brittle as
the thin civilization of late imperial Rome, its ruling elites
as dogged as 18th century <I>Chevaliers</I> facing The Great Fear,
and yet as helpless to stop its insatiable onrush.
<P>
And what happens to the Third World? What happens to those still
industrializing, still half-locked in the last revolution? If
so much disruption awaits those of the G-7, those who should be
ready but are not, how much worse will it be for those who still
daily deal in famine and industrial pollution?
<P>
To spectral witnesses like Bob Kaplan, the future belongs to the
Third World's masses of misery, where the driving force is not
economic revolution, but human and environmental degradation.
In his tortured landscape, cyberspace is the toy of neo-medieval
privilege, of a post-industrial caste secure in its pristine monasteries.
<P>
We can be sure that the agonies of Abidjan will not soon be relieved
by America's virtual public squares - the vision of <I>Byte City</I>.
But in Victorian times too, the industrial revolution brought
no succour to the slave markets of Mali. Today's transformation,
like the last, begins in a single place, and then fans out, staking
its claim over the historical reality it has created.
<P>
And these are like Victorian times in another way too. Third World
elites routinely, eagerly, spend their pampered youth in American
universities. As the architecture of a new world takes shape here,
ruling elites everywhere will rush to plug in! So the net that
transforms American life will pull in the gangsters and warlords
and languid princlings of Kaplan's forlorn anarchy.
<P>
And entrepreneurs. The economic revolution will make wealth everywhere.
Like the programmers of Bangalore, the new net will be a way out
and up for go-getters who need not get up and actually leave.
But these new enterprisers <I>will be working in America</I>.
And they will be less inclined to pay homage to physically local
rulers. And so ruling classes initially delighted will then clamp
down hard.
<P>
Just one story, from a Singapore Telecom exec-in-the-know:
<P>
<blockquote>
<I>My government doesn't care, it isn't listening in to our citizens
on the net; but I'll tell you one thing: Lee Quan et al freaked
out when they were told that there were 3000 unlicensed electronic
bulletin boards on the island! That's why we now have a national
web site. And [surprise] everybody posts there before they post
out. But we don't listen in.</I> 
</blockquote>
<P>
Sure. As Kishore Mahbubani, Singapore's permanent foreign secretary,
told me: &quot;We don't want America's decadence, but [to control]
there are other alternatives to <I>Pravda</I>.&quot;
<P>
Mechanisms of control will be everywhere; and not all will fail.
The industrial revolution that brought democracy to Britain brought
new paternalism to Germany: workers got protection, but old Junkers
kept political power. Through the wash of peoples we call the
Third World, there will be as many responses to the new as there
are cultures and tribes.
<P>
Those places lost today will likely stay lost. But many places
full of energy - like India and East Asia - will grow in huge
surges.
<P>
What is missing from analysis is how people respond to such creative
destruction. Kaplan controls humanity's outcome by reducing all
our options to a narrowing circle of choices in a world aching
just to survive. But economic revolution means expanding choices:
more stress, but more hope too. Fertile ground not for old, but
for new religions.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>The New Religions</I> 
</UL>

<P>
Economic revolution takes time to do its disruptive work. The
transformation of American life doesn't happen tomorrow, or next
year. It isn't ushered in by <I>Windows 95</I>, or forced into
our living rooms by set-top-box interactive TV. The world we are
building may only reach <I>initial</I> maturity - meaning an up-and-running
infrastructure - twenty years from now.
<P>
And its impact on the world will take still longer. We can anticipate
Big Change hitting Japan a bit before Europe. But both places
closest to us will be upended no later than a decade after we
take the first hit.
<P>
The great uncertainty rests with culture areas outside our own.
Even if social revolution in Europe is a calamity, it is difficult
to imagine <I>[though not impossible!] </I>the rise of a new ideology
there that would in its fulfillment of new meaning demand the
rejection of all things American.
<P>
It is far less difficult to imagine such an outcome among cultures
that historically have found fault with America. Those culture
areas that have suffered from contact with the West, and those
that believe especially that the US has inflicted on them a lasting
degradation of identity, will be receptive to new constructions
of meaning that celebrate <I><B>all</B></I> differences between
us - and them.
<P>
But even places that have been sympathetic to the American Crusade
since 1945 may respond with dismay to the theater of chaos that
economic revolution stages <I>- for all the world to see - </I>in
early next century America. Their dismay with us could have far
more historical consequence than the sum of all their current
frustrations. Consider:
<P>
Kaplan's terrible &quot;Coming Anarchy&quot; - like Freddie's
<I>Nightmares</I> observed in adulthood - translates into a sordid,
but not necessarily threatening, world. There are lots of unhappy
people out there, but their sad slide means they have less and
less with which to make us truly unhappy. Our national security
problem becomes our choice to be depressed by contemplating such
unhappiness.
<P>
But revolution gives us a <I>real</I> problem. It not only makes
things more interesting, it also makes them more threatening.
Revolution means the US has recreated economic life, but at the
cost of its former world leadership and the world system it led.
US allies from the old paradigm have been undercut, ironically,
by their former leader, whose economic revolution has sliced their
elites' authority off at the knees. Europe and Japan, plunged
into an economic clearance sale, have in pain and anger reorganized
their societies and their politics. And those 1980s dynamos of
growth, Dragons and Tigers, have exploded in their own dynamism.
<P>
<I><B>20xx. </B></I>There are new religions abroad.
<P>
New religions claim new allegiance. Industrial revolution created
<I>anomie</I>; <I>anomie</I> demanded meaning. And meaning came:
Positivism, Marxism, Socialism, Communism, Bolshevism, Fascism
...
<P>
We called these attempted new organizations of humanity <I>ideologies</I>.
Nonsense. They were new <I>religions</I>. And what is always distinctive
about new religions is their passionate conviction: that their
truth is the only truth. A world that creates several new religions
at once is a world eager for combat.

<I><B>How The New Make New War</B></I> 
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>No New War Without New Meaning</I> 
</UL>

<P>
There is no point looking at the world as it is, and then trying
to leap to the next war. We get stuck immediately in tortured
excursions that try to make of today's regime in Beijing or New
Delhi an adversary we could face in combat with a straight face.
Such exercises bring new meaning to the term, &quot;suspension
of disbelief.&quot;
<P>
And it gets harder the farther out we go with the same director
and cast - like a never-ending sequel to an old Defense Blockbuster:
<I> DPG XXIII, The Final Agony</I>. Planning tells us to take
today's snapshot - with all current trends holding - to some arbitrary,
even-numbered date called <I>the planning horizon</I>. This gives
us Beijing or New Delhi with <I>x+y</I> number of weapons more
than they have today. But the same, disbelieving face.
<P>
There will be no new war without new religions ... just as there
can be no revolution without a disruption of meaning. But that
disruption has already begun. So new religions are assured. It
is today's stale, crust-brittle constructions of meaning that
are not long to crumble.
<P>
<I>You don't believe this? </I>Why are we so shocked by Serbian
blood-vengeance, Chetchen blood-vengeance, Algerian blood-vengeance,
anybody's blood-vengeance, but not by its absent awareness among
our own?
<P>
<I>Meaning:</I> our elites take pride in denouncing these passions
as primitive, dismissing them as deviant: <I>If they can't be
put down, they should be condemned</I>. But these same elites
have no sense of the authentic source of these passions - a demand
for meaning in a world where stability and order have been ruthlessly
stripped away - and these passions abiding power - to fight starving
in the snow at 30 below, to make of yourself a living bomb, to
head-shot prisoners one after the other, without flinching, because
they are <I>The Stranger</I>. We watch, heads shaking, as the
edges of civilization slough and scale, and feel nothing but scorn
and superiority. The shock will come when it all hits home.
<P>
The shock at the violence of new religions - unlike our contempt
for today's brutal tribal chant - must be the shock of recognition
in revolution itself. Part of the experience of revolution is
overcoming that shock. Eventually, we will accommodate to upheavals
at the center, and they will seem different to us because they
happen here, or in places that we have long ago decided are civilizations'
centers. Not Serbia, not Daghistan; but Japan, France, China.
<I>The US</I>.
<P>
Revolution takes war away from the margins, from tribal splatterings
at the limits of what we control, and puts it back in the firmament
of the center, among close relations, in the heart of the world
<I>metropole</I>. It does this, of course, because revolution
so changes the world <I>bourse</I> that nothing else can stay
the same.
<P>
Conflicting new religions in a world after economic revolution
runs its course will be accepted by Americans. And we will surely
have run a course with many home grown cults and religions of
our own.
<P>
But we may be less ready to deal with triumphant, inimical, movements
that have us directly in their sights.
<P>
By less ready I mean less prepared to deal with the fruits of
their animus against us. Today, we chafe at the prospect of highly
motivated, Islamic revivalist groups doing their worst on us.
But compared to the potential power of a great new religious movement,
drawing strength from its millions and the surging technologies
of revolution, these zealot-clusters are nothing.
<P>
If new religious movements, like the Nazis or Bolsheviks of this
century, claim the energies of whole peoples - passionate, educated
millions - then the new world and its new meaning is really worth
worrying about.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>New War as the celebration of New Meaning</I> 
</UL>

<P>
We still think of Nazi Germany as somehow keener on new technology
than we: better tanks, guided missiles, jet planes; forgetting
that we pushed the technology envelope far more in our Good War
than they.
<P>
<I>German Scientists</I> became Cold War slang because of what
science and technology meant to the then-new-isms. And then we
shivered over <I>Sputnik</I> because of the meaning Soviets invested
in war's technology.
<P>
Soviet and Nazi religionists used the sharpest badges of modernism
- high-tech weapons of war - to celebrate <I>[and make us believe
in]</I> the inevitability of their triumph: hence the new wave
panzers and hot Heinkel formations of a Riefenstahl newsreel,
or ICBMs grimly rumbling across Red Square became the totems of
new meaning publically, flamboyantly celebrated.
<P>
Hitler's and Stalin's cults were receptive to new war because
new war could be used to emotionally insinuate the conviction
that their vision, their belief systems, were about to be unconditionally
fulfilled.
<P>
We have come to see war in stark contrast. We permit ourselves
some modest, tame association of war's technologies with our own
belief that mastery of such technology shows a kind of natural
superiority, but then we go and drown this almost-celebration
with apologies in advance of its demonstration. And how we have
done this too in historical retrospect, stripping former celebrations
even from The Good War, <I>even on its 50th</I>. To us, war can
never again be a celebration. It is at best a profession.
<P>
Why does distinction between war matter? It matters because war
for us serves a very different purpose than war for them. This
is the heart of the difference between <I>status quo </I>war and
revolutionary war; and it is the heart of the difference that
matters much more than the visible things that seem to make war.
<P>
Revolutionary war is not defined by revolutionary weapons, just
as <I>status quo </I>war is not defined by <I>status quo</I> weapons.
The weapons of war, and the way war is made, are vehicles
for realizing what this war represents, and in fact, what it is:
<B> Revolutionary War is the celebration, the realization, of
identity</B>.
<P>
This was true for the Hitler cult especially. It is important
also for us to understand how we defeated revolutionary war then.
The US met revolutionary war - the celebratory war of the new
cult - head-on: with a messianic fervor of our own. We made of
world war a <I>crusade</I> [in Ike's words], and used the power
of American movies and American music to infuse our &quot;war
effort&quot; with a religiousity of passionate commitment and
fulfillment. The power of mass, religious mobilization can be
glimpsed in the thrill Americans felt when hearing of Hiroshima.
The Good War built up enough messianism to carry us through a
dreary and depressing Cold War, twenty years and more down the
road. All the way to Vietnam.
<P>
Revolutionary war as enacted by the Hitler cult is worth remembering
because it was done to us. Memory should give us something real
with which to approach the future. Remember that it is a messy,
even unsatisfactory example, <I>but it is an example we all know</I>.
It is <I>unsat</I> because the thing that is to be feared in our
future - from the new religions - will not resemble the Hitler
cult; but war will have the same, celebratory purpose. For the
new religions, war will be essential to their becoming. The very
experience of war is realization of the new: you create yourself
by destroying the stranger.
<P>
This is why it is important to recognize the religious dimension
of Nazi, Soviet,<I> [and American] </I>war. And if The Good War
gave the US its Cold War momentum, The Great Patriotic War did
even more for the Soviet regime. It became the treasured, made-sacred
experience of the Soviet state and its peoples. It may have been
the only shared element of meaning holding up the rotten Church
of Lenin in its last decades.
<P>
But we, like the old Soviets, finally lost the talisman of The
Good War. Vietnam destroyed it, and young generations have all
but forgotten it. A half century of Cold War slowly turned its
back on the very celebratory war that immediately preceded it:
The Good War. The American way of war changed, and those who made
it, changed. Part of this was blamed on the A-Bomb, but there
was more at work than that. Things military became tied to a social
order: its own caste studiously, even excruciatingly niched in
the larger hierarchy of those who ran the Cold War, and Cold War
American life.
<P>
There is no longer an American Way of War in a national, and certainly
not in a religious sense. War has become a toolbox owned by the
ruling establishment. For the American overclass, war today is
a reverse affirmation: of everything that can be lost. This is
classic <I>status quo </I>thinking, of course. War is something
<I><B>not</B></I> to be fought, but its tools are always to be
<I><B>used</B></I> in support of that same <I>status quo</I>.
<P>
But preserving the late-twentieth century American <I>status quo</I>
is far different than France or Britain preserving the mid-ninteenth
century status quo. The difference: Americans don't like imperial
wars. Therefore, the Washington ruling establishment must manage
by demonstration and awe. This means maintaining very high force
levels for world management purposes, even in the absence of a
major competitor. These forces must be constantly and bullishly
in play - OOTW - and yet still not used. This helps to explain
why any successful war activity is immediately, and loudly trumpeted
as an advertisement for the national security sub-culture (which
includes defense industry and other civilian constituencies) as
a whole. In the face of domestic disinterest, a world management
force must be sold to Americans on the basis of a carefully crafted
package that combines residual nostalgia for the Good War crusade
and a coded message about preserving American military superiority:
<P>
<ul><I>We must stay on top [in control] or we will lose.</I> </ul>
<P>
The unintended emphasis, strangely for the superpower, is on losing.
In order to get the current force levels it wants for management,
the ruling elite must insinuate the notion that any retreat from
these levels is an historic loss or retreat for the American nation.
And in order to send this message - <I>as untrue as it is </I>-
these same elites must strike a tone of pessimism, even defeatism.
<P>
This mental stance is the starkest contrast to the unbounded optimism
of the religionist bound for revolutionary war: <I>The future
belongs to me</I>.

<P>
Defenders of the world <I>status quo</I>, the Cold War elite is
visibly hunkered down in its final <I>Plaine du Jarres</I> command
post. America's current national establishment was crowned in
crisis. Exigency equalled authority, so Cold War became the perpetual
crisis that demanded a perpetual imperial ruling class. And it
is a big, messy world out there. Even when the Big crisis - the
Cold War - died, there seemed so many out there to take its place.
Change was always out there, and always bad; which meant, always
good, for the elite.
<P>
But the onset of Big Change within the US is like &quot;The World
Turned Upside Down&quot; <I>[The denouement-tune Cornwallis let
play at Yorktown]. </I>Elites have no authority to defend against,
let alone even define, domestic change as a threat to national
security. It is simply a threat to their own security: the security
of their position.
<P>
It is an overclass in need of a rescuing world crisis - not a
<I>real</I> crisis, but an emotional situation that renews their
authority - that limits our imagination: our ability even to prepare
for the next <I>[real]</I> war. But this would not matter for
those charged with America's defense. Except for one thing. They
too are part, an indissoluable part, of that same elite. How did
this happen? With the coming of Cold War, the Brass moved into
their big building in the Imperial City complex. Theirs was the
point of the Free World spear, but they were also allowed into
The Mandarin Club as the American Empire's warrior-diplomats.
And most important: they gained real political influence in support
of a real political constituency - one-third of the Federal workforce!
They got sucked into Free World rule.
<P>
So responding to world change, and a world revolution that is
American-made, is channeled by Washington's <I>ancien regime</I>
into rigid, familiar paths, with the unconscious complicity of
America's military societies. The leading corps of these societies
see a dense and dangerous thicket for their people, but one they
must enter and none the less. And they seek, with all the nature
and honor embedded in their ethos, to bring everyone out on the
other side.
<P>
Their watch has marked the beginning of that dense and dangerous
peacetime. So they have taken to cut for themselves three characteristic
paths through the thicket: footpaths to the future. Call them

<P>
<CENTER><b>Readiness: </b></CENTER>
<P>
Readiness is a world view that believes in the robustness of control.
Things can be managed, and change can be held down, as long as
the we have the means. Readiness is the predominant peacetime
ethos of the Defense world.
<P>
One good opinion gives us the flavor of a true on-top, <I>status
quo</I> mind-set:
<P>
<blockquote>
The lessons and revelations ... of the Persian Gulf War victories
... mandate that a new style of warfare will be employed in future
elective wars. Technology offers the leverage that facilitates
the accomplishment of the new expectation imposed by the American
public. Our military can win decisively anywhere in the world.
It can defeat an adversary anywhere in world [sic!] in reasonable
amounts of time. The day of long drawn out warfare has past [sic!].
It can take battle to an enemy and with the proper technology
minimizes [sic!] our own casualties. It can destroy an enemy on
the battlefield while preserving, should it choose, the country,
national treasures and way of life of that enemy. [from a 1993
draft chapter, <I>Directed Battle, A Vision of the Future</I>]
</blockquote><P>
This quote was chosen because it represents, errors and all, an
authentic attitude rather than a massaged, politically disinfected,
nearly meaningless official statement.
<P>
Readiness defines the current enemy as the always-enemy, because
within its reasoning-loop, no big enemy could arise as long as
the superpower manages world conflict. &quot;Deterrence&quot;
migrates in this mind-set from a relationship designed to maintain
a permanent nuclear <I>status quo</I>, to a relationship where
vicious, but smaller regimes and bigger, but more benign regimes,
are both &quot;deterred&quot; from challenging a permanent American
world <I>status quo</I>.
<P>
The quote's emphasis on the Persian Gulf War as model is also
a feature of the predominant path. It implicitly freezes war by
codifying modern war as the last victorious engagement. This has
the benefit of freezing as well the institutions, relationships,
and force structure that fought that engagement. Modernity is
carefully contained within the realm of things that don't threaten
either institution, relationship, or force structure. So new technology
- and by extension, R&amp;D - is channelled into the development
of high-tech badges, refinements, or appliques to existing weapons'
phyla.
<P>
<CENTER><b>Reform:</b></CENTER> 
<P>
Reform's urge follows cherished American tradition. American military
reform - to some extent mirroring contemporary reform movements
in American society - seeks to improve bureaucratic performance
by improving efficiency. Intrinsic to its goal is the demonizing
of corruption and inefficiency. The core belief is that efficiency
is the <I>desideratum</I>: the thing most wanted. Efficiency solves
peacetime problems. It allows us to fight future battles without
increasing today's budgets. It is progressive in the sense that
it brings military society in-sych with what is considered better
and more modern in the current American spirit of the age. Admiral
Owens thus belongs to the lineage of all American reform, and
symbolizes military society's harmony with all of American society,
just as Root or Sims brought their services in tune with the Progressive
spirit of their day.
<P>
But this path is more of a response to domestic change than it
is preparation for future war. And it creates its own cultural
backlash. The example this time is from a former Defense Official's
reform briefing. The chart is entitled &quot;Achieving a Common
Futures-Oriented Framework For Defense Decision-Makers.&quot;
[<I><B>Chart 1</B></I>] The chart correctly - even powerfully
- identifies one of the deepest elements of corruption in the
DOD: the swarm of interest groups whose competing needs must be
resolved before any policy or budget can be made. The chart shows
the thick alphabet soup that must be adjudicated before even <I>thinking</I>
about the future can happen. He was fired for trying to do something
about it.
<P>
But reform, far from simplifying and sorting out the mess, often
only adds to it. The Joint Staff should have replaced several
layers in the bureaucratic pastry, like the service secretariats.
Instead, it is now yet another layer. Unless reform is the central
agenda of the highest authority, executed ruthlessly from above,
and responding to a widespread sense of crisis, indeed, a public
outcry for change, it only succeeds in creating yet another internal
interest group to be fed.
<P>
So reform's fulfillment waits, often until peacetime's end, for
crisis to make it so.
<P>
<CENTER><b>(r)evolution:</b></CENTER> 
<P>
Military &quot;revolutionaries&quot; within a peacetime status
quo elite tend to focus on new weapons. It was for true ninteenth
century French, it is true for the RMA guys today. Why?
<P>
For one thing, they can't even think about bucking the dominant
paradigm: preserving the <I>status quo</I>. They would quickly
be punished, or banished to the most terrible hell imaginable
for thinkers - obscurity - if they even suggested that military
change means deconstructing the old paradigm itself.
<P>
But then, even in obscurity, they could at least call themselves
<P>
(<B>R</B>)evolutionaries.
<P>
So focusing on weapons is politically safe. And if technology
change, which surely accompanies revolution, is big enough, <I>then
it actually looks like the technology change</I>. And the new
weapons it brings ... <I><B>are</B></I> the revolution.
<P>
A public example (because he now publishes openly) of this phenomena
is Andy Krepinevich's &quot;Funding Innovation: Low-Cost Operations
for Leveraging The Military Revolution:&quot;
<P>
<blockquote>
... in the 1920s, the U.S. military successfully laid the foundation
for success in the next great power competition by &quot;reinventing&quot;
itself in response to the geopolitical and military-technical
revolutions then under way. During the 1920s and 1930s, the military
services positioned themselves to engage in new and different
kinds of military operations - strategic aerial bombardment, amphibious
assault against stoutly defended positions and carrier-based air
strikes. And they did it on shoestring budgets. Denied the opportunity
to think &quot;richer&quot; about defense, the military services
thought &quot;smarter.&quot;

He is right about one thing. They did think smarter. About stuff
that was already in play. There was no revolution during the 1920s
and 30s. The stuff that was introduced in the Great War just got
worked on. Airborne assault, armored maneuver, carrier task forces,
aerial bombardment, wolf packs - the whole repertoire of the second
war was rehearsed in the world's collective military mind after
the first; year after year, <I>for twenty years</I>. It was just
that some thought more efficiently than others.
<P>
But as real war, the second differed from the first merely in
embellishment and in efficiency. It was better theater. But there
had been no revolution.
<P>
Yet how advantageous to say that cruise missiles or stealth technology
or microprocessors have &quot;revolutionized&quot; war! Self-styled
(r)evolutionaries can appear to take on the Col. Blimps of the
readiness mind set, saying they're cutting R&amp;D and merely
building the forces of yesterday, <U><I>while in reality never
threatening either their position or their mindset. </I></U>
<P>
(r)evolutionaries are in this way much like reformers: they want
to make the current system better. To the reformer, corruption
translates into the sloth and obesity of the system. To the (r)evolutionary,
corruption translates into &quot;old think&quot; about fighting
war.
<P>
But the system, meaning the prevailing paradigm that encompasses
both the physical, the institutional, and the ideational aspects
of a war society: the system escapes all re-thinking.
<P>
<I>None of this presumes that those defending any of these three
paths to the future are moral invertebrates, corrupt of mind,
or alien to honor.</I> They are serious people, the finest we
have, whose thinking is leashed by a system that permits them
to address only part of a problem, to analyze these pieces in
strict mental compartments, and to assemble them at their peril.
And the system that controls thought is neither conscious nor
deliberate; but it is enfolding. It is a complete belief system,
the reality-defining component of culture itself.
<P>
So when the rhetorician asks
<P>
<I>But where is (<B>R</B>)evolution?</I> 
<P>
We must answer:
<br>
<I>It simply cannot exist.</I> 
<P>
[At any level ... until the larger revolution spends itself sweeping
our old way of life away.]
<P>
Here the French analogy, full circle, holds little historical
comfort. The French too, like us, had their military trajectories
of mind. They had their predominant path to the future, and it,
too, was <B>readiness</B>. They had their <I>jeune ecoles</I>,
fighting for <B>reform</B>, efficiency, purity of command and
operation. And they had <B>(r)evolutionaries</B>, engineers whose
visionary weapons promised to hold the key to future battle.
<P>
And none of the paths were wrong. An ethos of <B>Readiness</B>
made the French army the most combat-honed force on earth; an
ethos of <B>Reform</B> pushed France at last to respond to the
Prussian threat; and an ethos of <B>(r)evolution</B> gave the
<I>armee</I> of the <I>grande nation</I> the techiest tools of
war.
<P>
But as separate mental footpaths to the future, they would meet,
finally, only at the place of defeat. Reform bested readiness
too late; and the big army reforms that followed the shock of
Sadowa, and Austria's stunning defeat in 1866, only served to
throw the French army into confusion. It went into battle in 1870
not knowing itself.
<P>
And it could not possibly know itself in time, because it had
not taken the time to know war: how war was really changing, how
the new world was machining it, re-engineering it, so that it
became something new.
<P>
We have several steps to take before we can begin to know this.
The first is seeing the real change, and accepting the irony that
<I><B>we</B></I> are making the revolution that will transform
the world. The second step is connecting a transformation in life
to a metamorphosis of culture itself, and then of war, which is
culture's creature. The third step is confessing that, even though
we begin the revolution in life, that others - their red dreams
not yet imagined - will begin the revolution in war. Because war
will be both their celebration of birth and its <I>realization</I>.
<P>
But if these recognitions were all we needed to begin the road
to the next war, we would already be into the journey. But there
are other obstacles, the <I>anti-recognitions</I> of denial, that
are more intractable, that hold us in place like little trees
with long roots.
<P>
<ul>
There is our hallowed record of historical success: W<I>hy question
it?</I> 
<P>
So long since we met a real competitor: <I>Who is this upstart?</I>

<P>
The comforting feel of ongoing &quot;reform&quot;: <I>Been there.
Did that.</I> 
<P>
The power of our national myth: <I>We will always rise to crisis.</I>

<P>
The talisman of triumphant technology: <I>But we have the Death
Star!</I> 
</blockquote>
<P>
So we await our Sedan. To dismiss this prospect, we must dismiss
the possibility of a future foe: an equal challenger with evil
intent. And to dismiss this possibility, we must dismiss the transformative
power of Big Change, and assert that we can keep control not only
of our world system, <I>but what happens to it</I>, forever.
<P>
But no one can do this.
<P>
So we await our Sedan.
<P>
This much is certain.
<P>
The only uncertainty is in its outcome.

l.</ul>
The Foundation's policy team -- staff, senior fellows, adjunct fellows and fellow travelers -- works to provide the political philosophy and public policies which will inform the civic discussion which is creating the next generation of American society and government.  The Foundation's Vice President for Policy, Bill Myers, guides that work (when tolerated), collaborates on it (when permitted), cajoles (often), harasses (sometimes),  and, in other ways, shepherds PFFs policy efforts.  So far, that work aims to assess The Big Change, divine The New Majority, replace the FCC, transcend the FDA, free public utilities, foster home ownership, and otherwise build a positive, practical vision for America.  When not so engaged, Myers threatens to play the part of Senior Fellow in order to write and speak on subsidiarity, federalism and public policies which are best addressed locally, topics on which he once frequently published.  Myers has previously provided more traditional direction to the policy activities of the Free Congress Foundation, the American Legislative Exchange, the State Policy Network, and the South Carolina Policy Council

<p>
<ul>
The Honorable Louis M. Sullivan, M.D. chairs the Foundation's Medical Innovation Project.  After serving as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in the Bush Administration, the longest tenure (47 months) of any HHS Secretary in U.S. History, Dr. Sullivan returned to Morehouse School of Medicine (MSM).  As Head of HHS, Dr. Sullivan oversaw the Federal agency responsible for the major health, welfare, food and drug safety, medical research and income security programs in service of the American people.<p>

Dr. Sullivan became the founding Dean and director of the Medical Education Program at Morehouse College in 1975, the first minority medical school founded in the United States in this century.  In 1978, MSM began operation as a two year program in the basic medical sciences, admitting its first class of 24 students.  On July 1, 1981, the Morehouse School of Medicine became independent from Morehouse College with Dr. Sullivan as its Dean and first President, and on July 1, 1983, MSM became a member of the Atlanta University Center.<p>


<dt><a href="/pff/multi/people/vlahos.jpg"><img hspace="8" alt="Picture of Michael Vlahos" src="/pff/multi/people/vlahos.gif"></a> <b><a name="Vlahos">Michael Vlahos</a></b>

<ul>While our lives move inevitably from future to past, Vlahos, a
senior fellow at the Foundation, has tried to march in a different direction.
From Bronze Age archaeology, Byzantium, and British imperial history at <a href="http://www.cis.yale.edu/FrontDoor/">Yale
University</a>, he moved to foreign relations and modern war at the <a href="http://www.tufts.edu/departments/fletcher/fletchCatalog.html">Fletcher School
of Law & Diplomacy</a>. As Director of Security Studies at <a href="http://www.jhu.edu/">Johns Hopkins</a>-SAIS, he
widened his view to take on war and society. So broadened, he was asked to turn
the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/White_House/Cabinet/html/Department_of_State.html">State Departments</a> Center for the Study of Foreign Affairs into a real,
long-range think tank. He did. Its theme became -- and, in 1988, just in time --
world change. Vlahos was then commissioned to help turn the U.S. Navys
rangefinders toward Big Change, while at the Center for Naval Analyses. In the
Foundation, he has found a place that not only sees the ongoing transformation of
American life -- the Big Change -- but that actively seeks to be a part of it.
Now Vlahos writes, in print and in the ether, about where we are going and how we
will get there.</ul>

<P><h2>Mission Statement</h2></center>
<p>
Progress is the belief that Mankind has advanced in the past, is presently
advancing, and will continue to advance through the foreseeable future.<p>

No idea is more American, no idea has played a more central role in the
development of Western, and more recently, American Civilization. No idea is more
important to our collective future, and no idea has suffered more from the
cultural nihilism of the past 30 years than the idea of progress.<p>

America's Founding Fathers were unwavering disciples of the idea of progress<p>

But theirs' was a special brand of progress. They understood history, to borrow
Hegel's words, as "none other than the progress of the consciousness of freedom,"
and they placed their own concept of freedom at the heart of the American
Declaration -- in the "self-evident" proposition that "all men are created equal;
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that
among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."<p>

From John Adams, who wrote that the American Revolution occurred first "in the
hearts and minds of the people," to G.K. Chesterton ("America is the only nation
in the world founded on a creed") to Margaret Thatcher ("No other nation has been
built upon and idea"), it has always been clear that America's identity
transcends geography and ethnicity. Historians have devoted thousands of pages to
explaining our nation's history as the history of her ideas, and if we can be
certain of one thing, it is that America's future will be determined by the
future of her ideas.<p>

The challenge we face is to describe for ourselves and our progeny the historical
underpinnings, economic principles, cultural mores and practical implications of
the next incarnation of the American Idea. We will be judged by our sons and
daughters on our success at renewing, reapplying and passing on the core values
of the American Creed.<p>

That explains the mission of The Progress & Freedom Foundation: To restore, to
renew and to recreate America's sense of its future, a future woven inextricably
with the ideas of progress and freedom. It has been said that "The best way to
predict the future is to create it." Creating ideas that will define America's
future is what the Foundation has set about to do since its inception in April
1993.<p>

The Foundation is a private, non-profit, non-partisan idea center organized under
<a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/treasury/bureaus/irs/irs.html">Section 501(c)(3)</a> of the Internal Revenue Code.

<h2>ADVANCING MEDICAL INNOVATION:</h2>
<P>
<B>Health, Safety and the Role of Government in the 21st Century</B>
<P>
<B>Executive Summary</B>
<P>
by 
Ralph A. Epstein, M.D., Thomas M. Lenard, Ph.D, Henry I. Miller, M.D., Robert D. Tollison, Ph.D., W. Kip Viscusi, Ph.D., William M. Wardell, M.D., Ph.D.
<P>
As Americans enter the 21st Century, we are poised to see tremendous
breakthroughs in medical technology - from genetic engineering
to surgical lasers to molecular transports.  Yet patients may
be denied these advances because the process for allowing new
medical products on the market is cumbersome, slow, expensive
and inefficient.  In order for Americans to have the latest technology
to improve their health - or even to survive - the Food and Drug
Administration - a prototypical centralized, bureaucratic regulatory
agency - must be reformed for the 21st Century.
<P>
While reforms have been tried in the past, they failed to significantly
improve the speed with which patients have access to new  products;
failed reforms have been too marginal to make an impact.  Therefore,
the following plan calls for a completely new framework for approving
drugs and medical devices.  Its goal is simple:  the regulatory
process should be designed to block dangerous or ineffective products
while also speeding safe and effective ones to the clinic.  While
such a system will have a great impact on stopping the flight
of our medical companies overseas and maintaining American global
competitiveness, its fundamental benefit will be to save lives
and increase the quality of life for Americans.
<P>
Currently the FDA has a statutory monopoly on new product approvals.
 This monopoly eliminates any institutional check on the regulatory
creep that inexorably has added time, costs and unpredictability
to the review process.  These effects have stifled the development
and introduction of new technologies to patients.  As long as
the only route to market is through the FDA, adverse trends in
product availability will continue.
<P>
Therefore, our plan opens the product certification process to
competitive forces.  It is not a complete laissez faire approach
with no government oversight, because Americans want a required
independent review to ensure safety and effectiveness.  While
maintaining the existing legal requirements for pre-market demonstration
of safety and effectiveness, as well as the FDA stamp of apporval,
the plan relies on nongovernmental bodies - called Drug or Device
Certification Bodies - to review and certify new products.
<P>
The competition among the DCBs for clients will encourage them
to offer the greatest expertise and reputation for integrity,
to identify and solve problems early and rapidly, to perform reviews
in a timely manner, and to manage the oversight and review efficiently.
 The FDA's primary function will be to certify the quality of
the certifiers, not to actually be a certifier of products.  The
FDA retains authority to issue the final sign-off approval for
product marketing, but with a new appeal procedure in the event
of disagreement with a company and/or DCB.  Also, the FDA retains
a powerful post-marketing  system for monitoring the safety of
products.
<P>
Specific highlights of the plan are as follows:
<P>
<B>DRUGS AND BIOLOGICS</B>
<P>
 
<UL>
<LI>For drugs and biologics, the primary responsibility for managing
the Investigational New Drug filing, oversight of the clinical
program, and New Drug Application/Product License Application
review will be transferred from the FDA to nongovernmental Drug
Certification Bodies (DCBs).  The DCBs, which can be profit-making
or non-profit organizations, will be subject to FDA certification
and staffed - as required by the language of the Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act - by the necessary &quot;experts qualified by scientific
training and experience.&quot;  
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The sponsor will submit New Drug Applications/Product License
Applications to the DCB, not to FDA.  After evaluating the application,
the DCB will submit a summary of the results of its review (if
favorable) to FDA.  The FDA Commissioner then has a designated
period of time to accept the DCB's recommendation for approval
(which, legally, is a &quot;rebuttable presumption&quot;) or to
deny approval.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
<B>MEDICAL DEVICES</B>
<UL>
<LI>Manufacturers generally will have a choice of methods by which
to get a product approved for market, by either demonstrating
conformance of its<I> quality assurance systems</I> or conformance
of the <I>product</I> itself.  Such a system is modeled on the
European Union's medical device regulatory system, which is characterized
by reliance on clear and objective standards that are largely
implemented by private, nongovernmental organizations.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>For all classes of devices except Class I (the least risky),
a DCB must audit the manufacturer periodically to confirm conformance
with the necessary standards.  The FDA's current auditing of manufacturers
for Good Manufacturing Practices will be replaced by the DCB's
certification of the manufacturer's quality assurance systems.
 Such certification will often exceed FDA standards as it could
include certification of design quality assurance.  It will also
be performed far more frequently than current FDA inspections.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Class III products (the riskiest products) will require premarketing
<I>design approval</I> by a DCB.  Although not part of the EU
system, the plan also requires the FDA to be notified 90 days
prior to marketing a Class III product, to allow time for the
FDA to elect to review the appropriateness of the certification
process.
</UL>

<P>
<B>APPEALS</B>
<P>
<ul>
Our plan establishes an independent, standing committee of experts
within the Department of Health and Human Services - the Medical
Review Board (MRB) - to advise the Secretary when the FDA disagrees
with a DCB's product approval recommendation.  The MRB will have
approximately 10 to 15 members representing a wide spectrum of
scientific, medical and regulatory expertise.  It will hear appeals
of FDA decisions to overturn a DCB recommendation, and will advise
the HHS Secretary.  All parties, including FDA, will be expected
to accept the decision of the Secretary.
</ul><P>
<B>LIABILITY</B>
<P>
<ul>
The plan includes a regulatory compliance defense for all product
liability, not simply a defense against punitive damages.<B> 
</B>The regulatory compliance defense recognizes that, by negotiating
the regulatory process, the manufacturer has fulfilled its requirements
with respect to the provision of products that provide an appropriate
level of safety, and that the government has certified this fact.
 Lawyers and courts should not be second guessing decisions regarding
product safety that have already been recognized by government
agencies as having achieved appropriate levels of safety.  Our
plan for replacing the FDA drug and device approval processes
would not limit the applicability of this defense, because there
would continue to be a regulatory mechanism to ensure that an
appropriate level of product safety is provided to consumers.
<P>
Of course DCBs will be subject to tort liability for negligence
in carrying out their obligations. Our plan recommends formalizing
the current recognition by the courts that such certification
bodies not be subject to strict liability to third parties injured
by products.
</ul>
<P>
<B>INTERNATIONAL HARMONIZATION</B>
<P>
<ul>
Our plan recommends that products approved in jurisdictions whose
standards are similar to those in the United States - for example,
Great Britain or the European Union - have the same status as
a product certified by a DCB.  Where applicable (i.e., for drugs
and Class III devices), products with foreign approvals could
be submitted to the FDA for U.S. marketing approval under the
same procedures and with the same rebuttable presumptions as a
DCB-approved product.

<P>
In its current form, the Food and Drug Administration is a prototypical
centralized, bureaucratic regulatory agency, similar to so many
other agencies designed during the heyday of the Progressive era.
 By modern standards, it is cumbersome, slow, expensive and inefficient.
 But its most significant costs are not financial - they are human.
 America's outmoded FDA directly results in jobs being exported
overseas.  And, most importantly, it denies new health technologies
to patients who need them to live healthy lives, or even to survive.
<BR>

<P>
The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation has undertaken a multi-year
effort to design and to create a new, modern institution that
will continue to ensure the safety and effectiveness of medical
products while providing patients with faster access to new treatments.
 Two earlier versions of a replacement model for the FDA were
circulated to the public with request for comment.  In addition,
the Advisory Committee, under the chairmanship of Dr. Louis Sullivan,
provided valuable guidance.  The views expressed here-in are solely

regulation in 1993, believing that the coming advances in medical

a regulatory process was in place that encouraged rather than
stifled innovation.<BR>

<h2>INTRODUCTION </h2>
<P>
<FONT >The United States leads the world in the discovery
of the new drugs, biologics and medical devices that offer the
promise of longer and healthier lives for our citizens.  But the
process of actually developing these products and getting them
approved for marketing has become increasingly lengthy, expensive
and complex.  The past several decades have seen breathtaking
scientific breakthroughs in areas such as biotechnology and computing.
 But these breakthroughs have yet to be translated in a significant
way into new medical products that benefit patients.  Regulatory
demands and delays are not the only reasons for this stagnation,
but they are significant factors.  America's regulatory procedures
are among the slowest and most expensive in the developed world,
and it is now common for U.S. companies to conduct product testing
and development abroad and for new drugs and devices to be available
first in other countries.  Consider the following:</FONT>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT >The time required to bring a new drug to
market in the United States, from chemical synthesis to marketing,
has increased steadily, from slightly more than six years in the
mid-1960s to almost 15 years currently<sup><a href="foot.html">1</a></sup>.</FONT>
<LI><FONT >The percentage of drugs first available
in the United States is low.  Seventy-three percent of drugs approved
by the FDA during 1987-93 had already been approved elsewhere.
 In the area of anticancer agents, for example, the United States
once led the world and now lags behind other nations.  During
the 1960s, cancer patients in the United States had more anticancer
agents available to them than did patients in Great Britain, Germany,
France or Japan.  Now, in contrast, patients in the United States
have fewer anticancer agents available than those in any of these
countries.<sup><a href="foot.html">2</a></sup></FONT>
<LI><FONT >In the medical device area, a product that
takes four years to bring to market in Europe frequently requires
six years in the United States<sup><a href="foot.html">3</a></sup>.  As a result, medical device manufacturers
in large numbers are first introducing their products offshore,
and American patients increasingly are receiving therapies that
are a generation or more behind those available in Europe.</FONT>
</UL>

<P>
<FONT > </FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Reversing these trends will require a fundamental
change in the framework used to bring new medical products to
the market.  Many studies have been performed and expert groups
convened with the goal of reforming drug and device oversight.
 But, they have failed to yield significant improvement in the
only meaningful bottom line:  total development times and product
availability.  Those reforms that have been adopted have been
too marginal to have an appreciable overall impact on improving
the system.  (Recent evidence may suggest that marketing approvals
recently have become slightly more expeditious, but no impact
has been seen on the overall time and cost of development).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Therefore, we propose a revised framework for
approving drugs and medical devices that does not alter the basic
objectives underlying the existing system:  that medical products
are evaluated by qualified experts on the basis of adequate data;
that they meet appropriate standards, defined in terms of the
relationship between benefits and risks; and, that they perform
as claimed on the label.  The regulatory process should be designed
to block dangerous or ineffective products; but, it should also
speed salubrious ones to the clinic.  The existing review and
approval procedures have achieved some success at ensuring that
products admitted to the market are reasonably safe and effective.
 But this benefit has been achieved at great direct and indirect
cost to patients, industry and government, with the introduction
of many promising new therapies delayed or prevented entirely.
 Much of this cost is unnecessary:  safety and effectiveness do
not have to be sacrificed by the introduction of greater regulatory
efficiency.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >A NEW INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has
a statutory mandate to assure that new drugs and devices are safe
and effective.  This mandate is combined with a &quot;monopoly&quot;
on new product approvals.  It is the monopoly part of this framework
that is the principal source of current deficiencies in drug and
device oversight, because there is no institutional check on the
regulatory creep that inexorably has added time, costs, and unpredictability
to the review process.  In fact, the FDA has raised the regulatory
burden on product sponsors by continually introducing new requirements
and policies without regard for their negative impact on the delivery
of new and innovative therapies to patients.  As long as the only
route to the market is through the FDA, the adverse trends in
product availability and development times are likely to continue.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Improving the balance of incentives, therefore,
requires opening the product certification process to competitive
forces.  If one extreme of the &quot;institutional spectrum&quot;
is represented by the current FDA monopoly, the other pole is
represented by complete laissez faire, under which decisions to
market drugs and devices would be made by manufacturers without
government regulatory oversight.  In theory, manufacturers would
still be constrained, by the desire to maintain the reputation
of their products and avoid litigation.  But our proposal rejects
this alternative.  Although a laissez-faire system may have some
merits, particularly for established firms with reputations to
protect, it may also provide firms with an incentive to take unwarranted
risks.  Moreover, most American consumers want a required independent
review to ensure safety and effectiveness.  For these and other
reasons, laissez faire is not a viable option for bringing new
medical products to the market in the United States.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The plan proposal, described here, maintains
existing or equivalent government standards and oversight, as
well as the FDA stamp of approval, signifying that benefits and
risks have been evaluated and balanced appropriately.  At the
same time, the proposal relies on nongovernmental bodies for review
and certification.  In this model, <I>the FDA is primarily a certifier
of certifiers, rather than a certifier of products.</I>  The element
of competition among the nongovernmental certifying bodies for
sponsors' business is an important element of the proposal.  By
providing product sponsors with choice among certifying bodies,
but retaining high product standards, the system institutes a
review process that is responsive to the needs of patients and
product development.<BR>

<h3><FONT >DRUGS AND BIOLOGICS</FONT></h3>
<P>
<FONT >The goal of the proposal is to speed the delivery
of safe and effective new drugs and biologics to patients who
need them.  To achieve this goal requires changes in the regulatory
system that will facilitate early clinical research, increase
the efficiency of drug development and its regulatory oversight,
and reduce the overall time and cost required for a new drug to
reach the market. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >There has been broad consensus for nearly three
decades that reforms of the current system are necessary.  Numerous
official panels and inquiries have proposed remedies, but they
have not been implemented expeditiously or widely.  The present
proposal embodies the most important and consistently repeated
of these recommendations:  management and structural reforms that
transfer tasks currently performed internally by FDA to outside
experts and organizations.  While FDA has at one time or another
delegated most of its review and evaluation functions to outside
experts or entities, this delegation has been piecemeal and disorganized;
partial privatization has never been integrated in a way that
could create an efficient overall system.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Other reforms recommended repeatedly by blue
ribbon panels have included a lesser role for FDA in the scrutiny
of early-phase clinical investigations and the wider use of accelerated
approvals coupled with continued post-market surveillance.  The
proposal adopts these recommendations, explicitly or implicitly.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The proposal rationalizes and enhances the
efficiency of the process for developing, reviewing and approving
new drugs and biologics by assigning principal review responsibilities
to government-certified <I>Drug Certification Bodies</I> (DCBs).
 At the same time, <I>the proposal maintains the existing legal
requirement for pre-market demonstration of safety and effectiveness</I>.
 Preserved as well are FDA's oversight, enforcement powers and
the agency's authority to issue the final sign-off approval for
product marketing.  Key elements in the process are outlined below
and in Figure 1.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>


<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >KEY PROPOSALS FOR DRUGS AND BIOLOGICS
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>

<UL>
<LI><FONT >The primary responsibility for managing
the Investigational New Drug (IND) filing, oversight of the clinical
program, and New Drug Application (NDA)/Product License Application
(PLA) review will be transferred from the FDA to nongovernmental
Drug Certification Bodies (DCBs).</FONT>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><FONT >The DCBs, which can be profit-making or
non-profit organizations, will be subject to FDA certification
and staffed -- as required by the language of the Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act -- by the necessary &quot;experts qualified by
scientific training and experience.&quot;  </FONT>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI><FONT >The sponsor will submit NDAs (or PLAs)
to the DCB, not to FDA.  After evaluating the NDA, the DCB will
submit a summary of the results of its review (if favorable) to
FDA.  The FDA Commissioner then has a designated period of time
to accept the DCB's recommendation for approval (which, legally,
is a &quot;rebuttable presumption&quot;) or to deny approval.</FONT>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI><FONT >If approval is denied, then at the discretion
of the sponsor and the DCB, a review by an independent Medical
Review Board, reporting to the Secretary of Health and Human Services,
may be undertaken.  All parties, including the FDA, are expected
to accept the decision of the Secretary.</FONT>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI><FONT >FDA will continue to administer the present
national system of pharmacovigilance, above the level of the DCB.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<IMG SRC="IMG00001.GIF"><FONT >The plan reforms will
stimulate competition to supply drug-development oversight and
review services;  that is, DCBs will compete for sponsor-clients.
 This competition will encourage DCBs to identify and solve problems
early and rapidly, perform reviews in a timely manner, and manage
the oversight and review efficiently.  The system will favor DCBs
that offer the greatest expertise, the best service and a reputation
for integrity.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The crafting of drug development and approval
strategies will benefit from competitive pressures on DCBs, because
there is much room for innovation:  the choice of factors such
as clinical endpoints, indications for approval, and regimes of
pre-clinical and clinical testing, ultimately drives the size,
time and cost of development programs; and, there is large potential
for savings in these areas.  Subject to the law's standards of
effectiveness and safety, DCBs will be free - and competitive
pressures will encourage them - to devise new and more efficient
ways of developing drugs and meeting the approval standards. 
This strategic competition and synergy between sponsors and DCBs
will transform the drug development and approval process and will
reverse the relentless spiral of rising time and costs. <BR>

<h3>MEDICAL DEVICES</h3>
<P>
<FONT >The plan for medical devices will in large
part follow the European Union's medical device regulatory system,
which is characterized by reliance on clear and objective standards
that are largely implemented by private, non-governmental organizations.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Under the EU system, all medical devices are
classified, using objective criteria, into one of four classes
(I, IIa, IIb, and III) representing increasing levels of risk
and complexity.  Devices may be marketed only if they conform
with a comprehensive series of <I>essential requirements</I>.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >As is the case in the EU, implementation of
the proposed system will involve the interaction of three groups:
 manufacturers, who bear the ultimate responsibility for their
products; private Device Certifying Bodies (DCBs), engaged by
manufacturers to provide independent certification of critical
manufacturing processes and products; and, the federal authority
(FDA), which maintains responsibility for public safety by ensuring
the competence of the DCBs, enforcing compliance with law and
maintaining a universal system of postmarketing surveillance.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Review under the new system should be expeditious
because competitive forces will only tolerate DCBs that are responsive
to the market.  The current system has been characterized by such
slow approvals that important products are not available.  Domestically,
venture capital has become scarce and manufacturers have been
forced to relocate critical operations offshore.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Because device innovation is often characterized
by many small incremental changes, a method of rapid certification
of new products is needed in order for U.S. Manufacturers not
to fall further and further behind.  For Class I devices, the
new proposal permits manufacturers to self-certify conformance
with the essential requirements.  In addition, manufacturers who
maintain a total quality assurance system may self-certify new
Class IIa and IIb products between the periodic audits by their
DCB.  Key elements of the proposal are summarized  below and in
Figures 2 and 3.<BR>

</FONT></B></CENTER>
<UL>
<LI><FONT >Manufacturers can ensure conformance with
the essential requirements by adhering to relevant internationally
agreed upon objective standards.  The manufacturer generally will
have a choice of methods, and will be able to either demonstrate
conformance of its<I> quality assurance systems</I> or conformance
of the <I>product</I> itself.  Combinations of these two routes
are permitted. </FONT>
<LI><FONT >For all classes of devices except Class
I, a DCB must audit the manufacturer periodically to confirm such
conformance.  The stringency of the audit and the number of areas
audited depend on the class.  The FDA's current auditing of manufacturers
for Good Manufacturing Practices will be replaced by the DCB's
certification of the manufacturer's quality assurance systems.
 Such certification will often exceed FDA standards as it could
include certification of design quality assurance.  It will also
be performed far more frequently than current FDA inspections.</FONT>
<LI><FONT >Class III products always require premarketing
<I>design approval</I> by a DCB.  Although not part of the EU
system, the proposal presented here also requires the FDA to be
notified 90 days prior to marketing a Class III product, to allow
time for the FDA to elect to review the appropriateness of the
certification process.</FONT>
<LI><FONT >All manufacturers will be required to have
a system for monitoring and acting upon reports of a device malfunction
after sale.  In addition, the FDA will act as a central repository
of such information when it involves a threat to patient safety,
as it is in a position to monitor the investigation of such events,
especially when they involve similar situations arising with several
manufacturers.  The FDA may, for cause, require that a device
be withdrawn from the market if the manufacturer has not ensured
that it meets the essential requirements or if the DCB has not
acted competently.  In addition, criminal charges may be brought
in the case of fraud or criminal negligence.</FONT>

<CENTER><B><FONT >THE MEDICAL REVIEW BOARD</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT > </FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Current FDA procedures do not provide an adequate
independent forum in which to appeal agency decisions.  Our proposal
remedies this deficiency by establishing an independent, standing
committee of experts within Health and Human Services - the Medical
Review Board (MRB) - to advise the HHS Secretary when FDA disagrees
with a DCB's product approval recommendation.  The MRB will have
approximately 10- to-15 members representing a wide spectrum of
scientific, medical and regulatory expertise.  It will hear appeals
of FDA decisions to overturn a DCB recommendation, and will advise
the Secretary.  All parties, including FDA, will be expected to
accept the decision of the Secretary.<BR>

<CENTER><B><FONT >LIABILITY<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<I><B><FONT >DCB Liability</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<FONT >The proposed system will provide the Drug and
Device Certifying Bodies with strong incentives to operate carefully
and responsibly.  DCBs will be subject to FDA oversight and the
possibility of losing their certification if they do not follow
applicable regulatory guidelines.  They also will be subject to
tort liability for negligence in carrying out their obligations.
 Finally, DCBs will be subject to lawsuits from manufacturers
for breaking contractual obligations.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The DCBs should not, however, be liable for
factors beyond their control.  It is, therefore, important to
formalize the current recognition by the courts that such certification
bodies not be subject to strict liability to third parties injured
by products.  Otherwise, particularly in the context of joint
and several liability, many responsible institutions will be reluctant
to enter the certification market for fear that their very existence
will be threatened by tort liability suits that might be completely
unrelated to the manner in which they carried out their obligations.
 <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><B><FONT >Manufacturer Liability</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<FONT >Our plan also addresses the tort liability
status of pharmaceuticals and medical devices firms more generally.
 Liability costs have disproportionately burdened these industries,
largely because their products are intrinsically involved in life
and death situations.  In fact, major lines of litigation, such
as those involving DES and the Dalkon Shield, have come to be
almost synonymous with the liability crisis.  The potential liability
exposure faced by these industries has discouraged new product
innovation, particularly for products related to pregnancy and
childbirth.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >At the current time, there is insufficient
recognition by the courts of the extensive role played by government
regulation in ensuring efficient levels of safety for pharmaceuticals
and medical devices.  To the extent that the current FDA regulations
do achieve socially efficient control of risk, superimposing tort
liability in addition to regulation is harmful, by deterring introduction
of beneficial new products.  Therefore, the proposal includes
a regulatory compliance defense for all product liability, not
simply a defense against punitive damages.<B><sup><a href="foot.html">|</a></sup> <BR>
</B></FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The regulatory compliance defense simply recognizes
that, by negotiating the regulatory process, the manufacturer
has fulfilled its requirements with respect to the provision of
products that provide an appropriate level of safety, and that
the government has certified this fact.  Juries should not be
second guessing decisions regarding product safety that have already
been recognized by government agencies as having achieved appropriate
levels of safety.  The plan for reforming the FDA drug and device
approval processes would not limit the applicability of this defense,
because there would continue to be a regulatory mechanism to ensure
that an appropriate level of product safety is provided to consumers.
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >OFF-LABEL USE<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >The slowness of the FDA process for approving
new uses for products already on the market deprives patients
and their doctors of critically important information for long
periods of time - long after the scientific evidence is available
that a treatment may be beneficial for a particular condition.
 The proposal will make the &quot;off-label&quot; issue less salient,
by lowering the costs and increasing the benefits for manufacturers
who obtain supplementary approvals for their products.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Currently, the FDA does not give supplementary
applications a high priority and sponsors have a limited incentive
to submit them.  Under the proposed system, DCBs will have the
incentive and the resources to process supplementals efficiently
and in a timely manner.  Supplemental approvals for devices will
particularly be facilitated, because manufacturers with the requisite
quality assurance certification will be able to self-certify label
changes (subject to the usual monitoring by the DCB).  Another
major incentive to submit applications for supplemental approvals
will be provided by the regulatory compliance tort liability defense,
which will be available only to products used in approved ways.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >INTERNATIONAL HARMONIZATION<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >A major premise of the proposal is that the
current system for bringing drugs and medical devices to market
suffers because the FDA represents the only route to market. 
Therefore, permitting alternative routes is healthy for the entire
system, and one way to do this is to encourage &quot;jurisdictional
competition&quot; from foreign approval systems.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This can most easily be done by permitting
products approved in jurisdictions whose standards are similar
to those in the United States - for example, the Great Britain
or the European Union - to have the same status as a product approved
by a DCB in the United States.  Where applicable (i.e., for drugs
and Class III devices), products with foreign approvals could
be submitted to the FDA for U.S. marketing approval under the
same procedures and with the same presumptive approvability as
a DCB-approved product.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Because it is based on standards and procedures
virtually identical to those of the European Union, adoption of
the proposed device system would, by itself,  substantially further
the goal of regulatory harmonization.  This system would make
it possible for a manufacturer to obtain both American and European
approval using the same documentation and inspections, and the
services of a single organization that could be certified both
as an American DCB and a European &quot;notified body.&quot; 
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >TRANSITION<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >A transition period of at least several years
will be needed to establish procedures to accredit DCBs and to
permit drugs and devices currently under review to be approved
under the existing system, if the manufacture should so elect.
 Once DCBs are available, any sponsor with an active application
before the FDA could withdraw that application and submit it to
a DCB.  At the end of the transition period, the FDA would cease
to perform review process functions.  Because of the European
Union device experience and the fact that (European) notified
bodies with U.S. affiliates and branches are already operational,
it is likely that the transition period for devices can be shorter
than for drugs. <BR>

<h2>I. Institutional Alternatives for the Regulation of Drugs and Medical Devices</h2>
by Robert D. Tollison
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >EXECUTIVE SUMMARY<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >This paper presents an economic and institutional
analysis of the various organizational alternatives which might
be adopted to reform the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
The present FDA system is described as a government monopoly over
the introduction of new drugs and devices.  While this system
has served the public well in some respects, in recent years it
has proceeded with so much excessive caution against mistakes
that it has substantially slowed downed the introduction of beneficial
new drugs and devices. Thus the issue is, how can the present
system be reformed so as to speed up the introduction of beneficial
new products, while maintaining the existing legal standards of
safety and efficacy?<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >At one extreme from the present government
monopoly is <I>laissez faire,</I> meaning allowing private decisions
to be made by drug and device manufacturers with respect to the
marketing of their products.  Although this system has some merits,
it is generally found to be wanting in several respects due to
problems related to information and incentives in such an environment.
 For example, some firms may take unwarranted risks in the marketing
of new products where there is no government oversight.  Therefore
complete reliance on the goodwill and reputational capital of
firms is ruled out on such grounds.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Various other organizational arrangements involving
degrees of FDA oversight and degrees of privatization of the certification
process are considered here.  These include:  the removal of FDA
veto power over new products, a private monopoly organization
(laboratory) to review and certify new products subject to FDA
oversight, the contracting out to private entities of many of
the functions presently performed by the FDA, and competing private
firms as suppliers of certification services under FDA oversight.
 Indeed, the example of the Underwriters Laboratory as a private
certifier and standard-setter for a large variety of products
and commodities is discussed in some detail as an example of how
a private entity might work.  Also considered are issues of competing
jurisdictions and the international linkage of drug approval processes.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >All told, the analysis concludes that competing
private bodies under FDA oversight represent the best bet for
institutional reform.  In many respects, this system derives from
the &quot;European&quot; system presently in place for medical
devices.  The general point is that such a system offers the opportunity
for the United States to achieve greater benefits from the speedier
approval of beneficial new drugs and devices, while at the same
time maintaining the important legal standards for safety and
efficacy under the aegis of the FDA.  Moreover, allowing internationally
recognized drug review bodies in other countries, such as Great
Britain, to act as private entities in competition with U.S. private
entities would further insure that safe and effective products
would reach U.S. markets at the same time that they reach the
market in other advanced, industrial countries.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT > Introduction<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >There are a variety of alternative institutional
arrangements which could be called upon to regulate and monitor
the safety and effectiveness of the nation's supply of new drugs
and medical devices. These range from the present system, which
can be classified as a government monopoly on drug and device
certification, to a free market system in which government would
have no regulatory role at all. In between these two extremes
are a number of institutional alternatives which combine more
or less government oversight with more or less private involvement.
 There are costs and benefits of each system, and it is through
a careful consideration of these costs and benefits that one can
proceed to choose a system that provides the most  net benefits
 to medical consumers. In this regard it should be acknowledged
that the present system of government monopoly, as embodied in
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and its accompanying legislation,
has undoubtedly provided substantial benefits over time to medical
consumers. This is not the issue. The point is to explore whether
the present process can be improved and strengthened so as to
continue to serve medical consumers into the next century. To
this end this paper examines the major institutional alternatives
for regulating drugs and medical devices, starting with the existing
system as presently administered by the FDA. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >Government Monopoly<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >The prevailing institutional arrangement under
which the FDA operates may be described as a government monopoly.
The oversight of new drugs, medical devices, and biologics is
centralized under FDA control. The hallmark of the FDA as a government
monopoly is the fact that producers have no alternative route
to the oversight of clinical research and the review and certification
of new drugs and devices other than through the FDA.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The existing literature on government monopoly
bureaus dates from William Niskanen's pioneering microanalytic
study of bureaucracy (Niskanen 1971). Niskanen modeled a bureau
as an agent which bargained with an oversight committee for funding.
Due to its comparative advantage in information, the bureau always
won in the bargaining process. Indeed, Niskanen postulated a theory
in which the bureau was in a position to win all-or-none bargains
with the oversight committee, thereby expanding its budgetary
base or policy mandate well beyond the &quot;optimal&quot; level
(i.e., the level required for the competitive provision of the
good or service). The primary implication of Niskanen's theory
was therefore that government agencies and budgets were overlarge,
bloated or overreaching because of the bargaining power of individual
bureaus.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The effect of the oversight process on bureau
policy choices was taken up by Weingast and Moran (1983) in their
study of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). These authors argued
that a bureau is the agent of its oversight committee when it
comes to policy choices. Indeed, they argued that bureaus are
perfect agents of the interest groups represented by oversight
committee members<sup><a href="foot.html">1</a></sup>.  Whatever the prevailing tradeoffs in policies
are (e.g., between consumers and producers, as deciphered, for
example, from the last election), the oversight committee imposes
these trade-offs on the bureau leadership. Reluctant or unreliable
bureau managers are replaced in a relentless drive to establish
the preferred political equilibrium. Weingast and Moran tested
their theory by showing how changing composition of the relevant
oversight committees led to a change in FTC behavior (i.e., case
selection). Their principal-agent approach is now the predominate
method for analyzing bureaucratic behavior in the literature.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >There are two major implications from the literature
with respect to the FDA. Niskanen's work suggests that the FDA,
like other government bureaus, has more resources at its disposal
than are necessary to carry out its legislative mandate, and,
moreover, the FDA will seek to act beyond its Congressional mandate
in policy matters. Weingast and Moran's analytical framework suggests
a more subtle issue to confront, namely, that the FDA is doing
what its congressional sponsors (and the interest groups who support
them, including drug manufacturers) want it to do. If the latter
implication is, in fact, the case, this suggests that the idea
of &quot;reforming&quot; the FDA will be a difficult task indeed,
because the agency may be doing what the relevant interest groups
want it to do. Simply adopting an alternative institutional arrangement
(e.g., contracting out), while maintaining FDA veto authority
over new products, will not necessarily improve FDA behavior.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Given that the FDA is a government monopoly
that determines whether new medical products are safe and effective,
standard microeconomic theory predicts a higher FDA &quot;price&quot;
of approval and a lower quantity of approvals. And the property
rights structure of the FDA reinforces this bias. The FDA is not
the residual claimant for any additional gains realized from earlier
approval; manufacturers receive such gains. Yet if problems arise
from earlier approval, the FDA bears the costs in the form of
a public outcry or a backlash from congressional overseers.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The essential critique of FDA monopoly behavior
is that it spends inordinate resources to police unsafe drugs
and devices so that useful products are delayed in reaching patients.
The historical basis of this behavior is well documented, and
the political model that underlies it is clear. The consequences
of allowing an unsafe product on the market are obvious and politically
disastrous for the agency and its overseers. The consequences
of delaying an otherwise effective and safe drug or device (e.g.,
the lives saved as a result) are much less obvious and less politically
costly (although they may exact used higher &quot;costs&quot;
in terms of needless suffering or death.) The FDA therefore responds
to existing incentives and behaves in a predictable fashion. 
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Moreover, the personification of the consequences
of an unwise decision onto the leadership of the FDA and the relevant
members of Congress intensifies the problem. Voters may prefer
a more expeditious approval process, yet the fact that FDA administrators
face the consequences of toxicity directly implies that they will
prefer more &quot;insurance&quot; than the average voter would
&quot;buy&quot; in such a situation. Bureaucratic incentives thus
compound the problem, making the review process work more conservatively
than individuals in general would prefer. This type of argument
applies to all types of government programs whose outputs involve
risk and uncertainty (e.g., national defense). Thus, in general,
the FDA bureaucracy probably deploys more resources to the prevention
of harm from drugs and devices, at the expense of new drug and
device approval, than the average voter would prefer.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >What are the effects on the drug and medical
device industries of a politicized, risk-averse monopoly in charge
of approval? The expectation is what the empirical record reveals.
The return to innovation has fallen and become more uncertain
and research and development has moved offshore, so there is less
domestic innovation. One observes &quot;approval arbitrage,&quot;
whereby companies concentrate their R&amp;D efforts overseas where
the regulatory burden is not so onerous. More subtly perhaps,
the type of innovative activity may have changed. Owing to the
high costs and uncertain outcome of seeking government approval,
research may tend to focus on lower risk research projects which
manufacturers are confident will pass scrutiny and make money.
The high costs of approval, coupled with an imperfect capital
market, may also act to keep potential entrants out of the industry,
suggesting that the FDA has been &quot;captured&quot; by existing
manufacturers who are quite comfortable with the present system.
The increased uncertainty also raises the cost of capital for
drug and device firms, and acts to reduce the pool of capital
available for funding new research.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >One alternative to the current regime would
be to establish a clear description of  the requirements a new
drug or device must satisfy to be approved, thereby reducing some
of the arbitrariness in the approval process. This is one of the
proposals put forward by former Vice President Quayle's Council
on Competitiveness. This seemingly minor reform would have a number
of beneficial effects. Notably, it would remove much of the variance
in the returns to innovation. A more certain return would allow
firms to fund R&amp;D at lower cost of capital, perhaps spurring
innovation. Investments would no longer have to be certain winners,
and much important work that might have gone undone could be funded.
Fixed rules would also lower the cost of seeking approval by reducing
unanticipated and costly delays arising from requests for more
information. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Such reforms are not a panacea. The FDA is
a governmentally sanctioned monopoly without a profit motive,
and it will bear political costs if drugs and devices are approved
too quickly. To minimize this risk, the FDA will lobby hard to
adopt extremely stringent rules, perhaps to the point of further
reducing the number of approvals.   Even fixed rules will suffer
from &quot;mission creep,&quot; wherein annual revisions gradually
add to the total regulatory burden as the FDA seeks more and more
insurance against a drug or device failure and consumer advocacy
groups trumpet every perceived error by the agency. The FDA's
incentive will continue to revolve around security and budget.
As a government monopoly, there will be no outside competitive
verification that the rules of safe testing are the most efficient
and least costly set of rules that achieves the desired levels
of safety and effectiveness. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >There are a galaxy of potential institutional
reforms that could be applied to the FDA, but there are large
problems which any meaningful reform must address. Chief among
these is the position of the FDA as a premarket monopolist. Given
the monopoly position of the FDA and its accompanying legal authority,
there is a lack of competitive structure in the U.S. drug oversight
and review process, so that service to new-drug sponsors is predictably
at levels that are extremely low and intolerable in other contexts.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The FDA, however, does not exist in a vacuum.
And here the experience of comparable agencies in other countries
may hold the key to understanding how the FDA process could be
improved. There is ample evidence from European countries such
as Great Britain and Germany and the evolving policies in the
European Union (EU) to suggest that the. United States has fallen
into an inefficient approval process. This evidence generally
suggests that European countries are able to bring new products
to the market faster than the United States, while maintaining
substantially equivalent safety and effectiveness results. This
suggests that the institutions of drug and device review and approval
in these countries have attained a better trade-off between protection
and progress than U.S. institutions have. That is, for an equivalent
amount of consumer protection they are able to bring products
to market faster. This competitive discrepancy in U.S. policy
has been apparent for decades, suggesting the need for fundamental
reform of the FDA.  Moreover, some linkage between the United
States and European systems might be in order so as to introduce
a competitive element into the U.S. system.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The present system in the United States works,
but it does not work as well as it could. This is the basic point.
The point is not to scrap the present system, but to make it at
least as effective and efficient as comparable drug and device
review systems around the world.  Recently, there has been a shift
in the preferences of oversight committees, a fact which suggests
(from the literature already reviewed) that the agency will have
to change and that the door is open to reform.  More importantly,
the example of Europe cannot be ignored or denied. These countries
have established faster and equally safe review processes at a
lower level of total expenditure. It is thus imperative that we
learn from the European experience, and explore linking U.S. policy
to European policy.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT >A Simple Model of a Monopoly FDA<sup><a href="foot.html">2</a></sup><BR>
</FONT></I>
<P>
<FONT >The cost of drugs or medical devices can be
characterized using a simple model (as shown in Figure 1) in which
the cost of precaution is traded-off against the cost of remedial
measures in the event of post-approval problems with a drug. Costs
of precaution are shown rising to the right as the level of precautionary
care is increased. These costs represent the effort by the FDA
to keep potentially harmful or useless products off the market.
Costs of remediation are shown declining from left to right based
on the assumption of declining marginal returns from increased
expenditures on precaution. These costs are the effort by the
FDA and manufacturers to engage in post-marketing surveillance
of problems with previously approved products and by manufacturers
to pay for damages their drugs have caused. Theoretically, the
&quot;optimum&quot; level of precautionary measures is at the
point of lowest total cost, and if all these costs are internalized,
this should be the expected level of precautionary care exercised
by manufacturers. On the surface a level of care set by the FDA
at this &quot;minimum&quot; level of total social cost should
guarantee the most efficient market for drug and device use.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >If the FDA could accurately determine the optimum
level of precaution, the government monopoly system might be efficient.
The problem is that it cannot. Regulatory standards are therefore
set according to some &quot;risk&quot; standard that satisfies
the internal requirements of the regulators. Regulators have no
incentive to choose a level of precaution less than the optimum,
so the &quot;optimum&quot; level of care becomes the lower bound
of the standard.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Current FDA standards are positioned somewhere
above the lower bound -- arguably, toward the higher end of the
scale -- resulting in an inefficiently high proportion of resources
put into prevention and a higher total cost than necessary. The
solution to this problem lies in providing better incentives for
firms to internalize the costs of precaution and remediation.
The rest of the paper explores several alternatives in this regard.

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >Self-Certification?<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >Self-certification of new drugs and devices
would be the functional equivalent of <I>laissez-faire</I> in
this area of public policy. Firms would be responsible for their
own testing and certification procedures for safety and effectiveness
(which could include the use of third-party certifiers), and would
stand to gain or lose in the marketplace depending upon the reliability
of their products. There are numerous layers of questions with
respect to self-certification. How would it work? How would it
work relative to alternative processes involving government oversight<sup><a href="foot.html">3</a></sup>?The
standard economic analysis of self-certification is related to
Akerlof's (1970) classic paper on &quot;lemons.&quot; He analyzed
a market situation in which sellers have perfect information about
product quality and buyers have limited (prepurchase) information.
In this case bad products come to be overvalued and good products
undervalued, and a sort of Gresham's Law prevails -- bad products
drive good products from the market. Bad products are the only
products that continue to be sold, if the market continues to
exist at all. There is thus an inefficiency in markets with asymmetric
information -- quality levels are too low, and firms have no incentive
to introduce higher quality products because they do not capture
the full benefits from their introduction. A market failure is
said to exist in such cases.<sup><a href="foot.html">4</a></sup>
<p>
This failure does not necessarily
imply that government intervention is the solution to the problem.
The market fails to provide the correct amount of quality relative
to a case where buyers have perfect information. However, since
government cannot provide perfect information either, the issue
becomes how the private sector might respond to such an issue
in conjunction with some form of government oversight.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >There are a variety of ways that firms and
government might respond to the problem of asymmetric information,
some relevant to drugs and medical devices and some not. Firms
can offer guarantees and warranties, factors which would not seem
to apply in the case of drugs and devices. Firms can appeal to
third-party certification organizations such as medical laboratories
and set up a system of industry standards. This approach is directly
applicable to the case of drugs and devices, as will be discussed
below. An alternative approach, which is consistent with relying
upon a <I>laissez-faire</I> version of self-certification, consists
in relying upon firm investments in reputational capital to signal
the presence of high-quality products.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Klein and Leffler (1981) and others have shown
that under certain conditions, where firms have a comparative
advantage in producing and disseminating information about product
quality and where consumers have difficulty in deciphering product
claims before they actually consume the product, markets will
respond by making it worthwhile for firms to invest in brandname
capital (BNC). The concept is simple. Firms have incentives to
invest in BNC as a means of posting a bond with consumers. So
long as a firm produces products that are safe, reliable, and
trustworthy, consumers are willing to pay a premium for such products.
This premium constitutes a flow of payments that are capitalized
into BNC, and the premium represents a quality-assurance payment
by consumers. So long as firms deliver on promises of quality
and credibility, consumers will reward firms with premium payments
for brandnames. In equilibrium the premiums should just offset
the costs to firms of providing quality-assurance services to
consumers. If the firm makes a mistake or chooses to renege upon
its investment in BNC, it will be punished in the marketplace
as consumers will no longer pay a premium for the branded product.
And, indeed, there is ample evidence that drug firms are punished
substantially in this way (Jarrell and Peltzman 1985).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This is really a point about private contracting.
Klein and Leffler analyzed the role of implicit contracts when
explicit government-enforced contracts are incomplete or too costly
to establish. One form of an implicit enforcement mechanism is
for the potential defector to make an investment in a firm-specific,
nonsalvageable asset. This investment acts as an implicit guarantee
that the firm will not cheat the customer because cheating will
result in forfeiture of the investment. That is, the firm will
lose future business, and the investment in the nonsalvageable
asset will be lost. The purchase of a non-salvageable asset is
equivalent to posting a bond that assures non-cheating behavior.
For their part, customers pay a price premium for the product
to induce the firm not to cheat. In equilibrium the value of the
investment in the nonsalvageable asset just dissipates the &quot;protection
money&quot; offered by buyers so that the firm earns a normal
rate of return on its investment in quality-assurance and provides
a higher-quality product in exchange.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Looking at the argument more closely, one could
argue that asymmetrically distributed information frequently creates
markets. As information costs increase, the probability of informational
entrepreneurship increases, and this probability increases as
demand elasticities decrease. The price component of price elasticities
does not solely reflect the actual price charged for a good, but
the search costs consumers incur prior to paying the price as
well. To the consumer both the search costs and the price paid
for the good represent the cost of consumption. Hence, consumers
with inelastic demands will incur higher search costs, as well
as higher prices, with relatively little change in quantity-demanded.
Also, according to the Alchian and Allen theorem (Alchian and
Allen 1972), high fixed costs generate higher expenditures, (as
long as a couple must hire a baby-sitter when they go out, they
will treat themselves to a nicer dinner.)  High prices, high search
costs, and the opportunity cost of misinformation apply to the
drug and device markets, and a consumer will rationally spend
more on information collection upon incurring these costs. The
consumers' willingness to pay for information, and the high costs
of doing so on their own, create an opportunity for an informational
entrepreneur, who, by specializing in evaluating drugs and devices,
realizes scale economies due to the indivisible nature of information
(upon obtaining the information, his average cost drops as he
distributes the information). These medical products markets will
thus tend to develop informational entrepreneurs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In medical markets physicians and pharmacists
engage in informational intermediation. For instance, a Doctor's
diagnosis is informational intermediation: the patient has rationally
decided to pay for the doctor's specialization rather than invest
in the human and physical capital required to diagnose himself.
In prescribing a medicine the doctor reduces the patient's transaction
costs. The patient also invests in the additional safeguard of
a pharmacist who specializes in evaluating drugs. If a new medicine
which the pharmacist rates as more effective than as the prescribed
medicine exists, or if the patient's current medicinal regimen
conflicts with the prescription, the pharmacist consults with
the physician to change the prescription (if the applicable state
laws allow). This relationship existed prior to the advent of
the FDA, and in today's more advanced medical industry, it would
surely continue in the absence of the FDA. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >What prevents medical professionals from underinvesting
in medical information? Markets, of course, provide patients with
their first line of defense. A fly-by-night drug firm may invest
little or nothing in some placebo, rendering the credibility of
drug firms suspect. Patients, however, can quite easily inform
themselves about doctors and pharmacists. First, patients observe
the professionals' credible commitments; after years of training
the professionals have invested heavily in human capital and are
unlikely to underinvest in obtaining returns from the investment.
Moreover, doctors and pharmacists operate in a competitive market,
and their fees and volume of business will consequently reflect
their abilities. Lastly, health-care contracts, like all others,
are subject to fraud and liability law. If medical professionals
behave in an uninformed manner, they risk the assets they sunk
in their training and potential legal damages. Rationally, doctors
and pharmacists will require evidence regarding the effectiveness
and safety of a drug or device prior to prescribing or dispensing
it.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Cures for many health maladies occur within
a rather narrow band; only one basic biochemical structure may
effectively vaccinate individuals against the mumps, for instance.
The first firm to discover, patent, and market this structure
obtains a monopoly. A competitive market for medical innovation
exists in pursuit of these monopoly profits. Advocates of government
intervention often cite these factors as creating a &quot;race
for the bottom,&quot; in which firms, rushing their products to
the market, underinvest in both development and testing, leading
to a lowest common denominator market. Justice Brandeis's famous
phrase, however, is as incorrectly applied here as it was when
he coined it for the market for corporate charters. It is the
very existence and pursuit of monopoly profits which assures that
adequate research and testing would occur in the absence of government
intervention.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Without the ability to monopolize markets,
medical innovation would essentially cease. Medical research entails
investments of hundreds of millions of dollars to discover a potential
drug, and such costs are fixed. If, after incurring such massive
expenses and risks, competitive market conditions prevailed and
price was equated to marginal cost, the innovating firm would
not recover its research and development costs, but just the costs
associated with the production of the drug. Obviously, as the
probability of such an event increases, investments in discovery
will decrease. For a firm to invest in research and development
it must expect a downward-sloping demand curve.<sup><a href="foot.html">5</a></sup>
<p>
This, of course,
is a theory of the competitive provision of quality-assurance
by private firms. And it works in a general way in the economy
at large. Firms undertake investments in BNC, and markets punish
firms that renege on such investments. Informational entrepreneurship
does take place. Put another way, one does not tend to observe
pervasive &quot;lemons&quot; problems in modern economies. One
can go across the spectrum of the economy, and find firms behaving
in the manner predicted by the BNC theory. So there is little
doubt that self-certification plays a large role in providing
safe and effective products to consumers.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Would such a system work with drugs or medical
devices? Such a system is certainly an effective alternative to
the present regime of government monopoly. Nonetheless, there
are problematical aspects of a complete self-certification system.
The primary drawback would be that small, undercapitalized firms
might take risks in such an environment which would ultimately
be costly to consumers. The time required for drug development
(15 years) means that incentives might be distorted for small
firms. Such firms, which do not have enough resources to sustain
liability judgments, might very well provide less than optimal
amounts of testing so that consumer harm would result from such
a self-certification system. In other words, small firms might
simply &quot;roll the dice,&quot; hoping to come up with a winning
new product and not be able to sustain a liability judgment if
they are wrong and the product is not safe and effective and causes
harm to consumers. Such considerations dictate some type of government
oversight of drug and device testing.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Perhaps a more telling point about self-certification
is that it is analogous to refereeing your own paper as a academic
specialist. Peer review serves a valuable scientific service in
bringing to bear a more objective evaluation of the contribution
of a scientific paper or result. In addition, peer review generally
leads to an improvement in the quality of scientific papers. Government
oversight of drug and device testing may perform a similar service
for consumers that a self-certification process cannot. Peer review
processes, however, in general show the same kind of bias that
the FDA shows.  (i.e., peer review puts heavy emphasis on culling
out unusual but perhaps path-breaking papers.)<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >It is thus an open question whether self-certification
in practice would lead to an effective system of drug and device
review and testing. And keep in mind that self-certification simply
means that firms can employ any feasible means to test and review
products. Market reactions would reward those firms who provided
the most cost-effective and reliable means of testing and certification.
The problem of small, fly-by-night firms attempting to limit testing
procedures or to mislead consumers would also be disciplined by
market reactions. Nonetheless, there would seem to be some role
for government in overseeing the medical product review process.
In laying out the standards or protocols for product testing,
for example, government could effectively forestall the small,
undercapitalized firm problem. The problem with government oversight
is how to delimit such a function so that innovation and new product
introduction are not stifled as a result. As the experience in
Europe has shown, there are areas, such as low-risk medical devices,
where firms can be allowed to self-certify medical products, subject
to meeting pre-specified government standards. This is not complete
<I>laissez-faire</I>, but it is a way to allow the market to work
with minimal government oversight. <BR>

<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >Remove the FDA Veto Power?<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >A basic conundrum underlies the institutional
analysis of the FDA. If, in fact, the FDA is simply carrying out
the mandate of its legislative overseers, as Weingast and Moran's
(1983) analysis suggests, any institutional arrangement that maintains
the current government monopoly of oversight responsibility will
embody the same incentives as the current system, and will represent
only a marginal improvement over the status quo. This is why some
observers have advocated removing the FDA's veto power over new
drugs and devices (Kazman 1990).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This is an interesting proposal. In essence,
it represents a full-scale version of <I>laissez-faire</I> in
drug and device certification. In such a regime firms could approach
the market in any way they chose. They could self-certify, use
private third-party certifiers, or use the FDA, which would be
reconstituted as part of an overall competitive certification
process. Such a system has intriguing possibilities in that it
would undoubtedly foster innovation in the certification and testing
process, and the FDA would have to be responsive to such pressures
in this regard. And, over time, consumers would come to rely upon
those certification procedures that worked best. So if one were
to support a <I>laissez-faire</I> approach to certification, letting
the FDA compete in this process might be a good idea.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Such a system is not without problems, however.
In general, it would suffer from the same basic problem that completely
privatized certification suffers; namely, there would likely be
informational failures and asymmetries such that higher quality
products are driven from the market. For example, in a combined
public-private review process without a government veto, small,
undercapitalized firms would have the option to take excessive
risks in the form of introducing incompletely tested products
into the marketplace. In the event of subsequent problems consumer
welfare would suffer.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >So the issue of removing the FDA veto is another
version of the issue of whether <I>laissez-faire</I> will work
as a certification process. Such a system would undoubtedly be
an improvement over some alternative institutional arrangements,
but it seems apparent that some form of government oversight is
necessary to insure that the certification process works in the
interest of consumers. The key is to be able to design an oversight
mechanism that will foster the use of private, competitive testing
procedures and that will speed approval and hasten innovation
in both products and testing procedures while maintaining a core
of essential government oversight over the process. Indeed, limited
government oversight would probably work better than a system
with a vetoless FDA. The presence of a vetoless FDA alongside
alternative private certification institutions would undoubtedly
inhibit the emergence of a robust private certification process
for a variety of fairly obvious reasons, such as the problem that
private firms would have in competing against a government-subsidized
FDA. And for that matter, in the present environment of product
liability lawsuits, companies may not have any choice except to
use the FDA for product approvals.<BR>

<CENTER><B><FONT >Direct Government Involvement in
Certification: The Case of the FAA<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >This particular institutional setting involves
emphasis on self-certification by manufacturers with the direct
involvement of government in the process. In fact, in this case
one does not have to rely upon a hypothetical discussion. The
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) currently implements such
a system for airplane development.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In aviation the key approval required for a
new aircraft comes in the form of a type certification.<sup><a href="foot.html">6</a></sup>All
aircraft flown in the National Airspace System must have a current
airworthiness certificate which implies that a type certification
was granted to the original manufacturer<sup><a href="foot.html">7</a></sup>. This certification requires
that all parts and processes used in the manufacture of the airplane
and that the flying characteristics pass government requirements.
As with drug and device approvals, this certification can be expensive
to obtain.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The basic process is shown below. Manufacturers
begin the design of a new aircraft with certification requirements
in mind. Firms tend to use many existing parts and subassemblies
that have previously been certified as well as certified production
techniques. Before they begin to build the first components, most
manufacturers submit an application of the new design to the FAA.
The FAA responds by putting together a certification team. The
size of this team depends on the complexity and size of the new
aircraft. A small, single-engine aircraft for general aviation
may only involve a few people while a large commercial airliner
may involve a team of hundreds of members. The certification team
meets and reviews the new design. Based on the newness and the
degree of innovation, they inform the manufacturer of certification
requirements after obtaining the manufacturer's input.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Initial Design Concept  Firm Submits Concept
to FAA  FAA Organizes Certification Team   Firm Builds and Tests
Aircraft  FAA Reviews Firm's Test  Final Approval<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The FAA provides inspectors and oversight of
the new aircraft's development and production. Some of these FAA
personnel essentially work full time at the larger plants overseeing
the development and production process. They supervise the testing
of components and manufacturing procedures and verify adherence
to FAA regulations. Thus, the function of independent testing
is performed concurrently with development and production by a
team composed of FAA and company personnel.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This method provides for incremental approval
due to the continuous certification process. The theory is that
if all components are certified as safe, the full aircraft has
a higher probability of being safe. The FAA requires extensive
flight testing with special emphasis on key flight regimes. This
means that not only does the plane have to have predictable flight
characteristics for its intended functions, but the requirements
are continually updated based on past accidents and problems.
At the end of these tests the FAA awards an air worthiness certificate
that allows the sale and use of the aircraft for commercial and
private purposes. The FAA may also require additional testing
as the result of subsequent accidents, maintenance data, or general
safety concerns after the aircraft has entered service. However,
the bulk of the tests required for recertification will be done
by the manufacturer and submitted to the FAA for approval.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >There are several important features of this
type of certification procedure. First, unlike the FDA procedure,
it gives the manufacturer considerable control over the time required
for certification. Firms can invest heavily in testing in order
to get a product to market more quickly. Part of this is accomplished
by careful planning and coordination with the FAA in the initial
meetings. The rest can be accomplished by investing in flight
test facilities or services. Second, firms are less under the
control of government schedules and bureaucracies. Third, the
self-certification system provides a slightly weaker liability
position for the firms. The firm has only itself and a few government
inspectors to uncover all problems. Thus, it is possible that
this shorter approval process has a higher cost in the form of
greater liability exposure.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Indeed, the element of self-certification involved
in the production of aircraft has contributed to the liability
problems of the industry, and there is still the &quot;refereeing
your own paper&quot; type of problem with self-certification systems.
And even with a great deal of government oversight, it seems unlikely
that drug firms would do their own certifying. Independent certification
provides a form of quality-assurance to consumers that self-certification
cannot. For such reasons the FAA system does not seem amenable
to the drug review process, and in some respects would probably
come to represent a bureaucratic nightmare for the industry. Nonetheless,
elements of this model are applicable to some medical devices.<sup><a href="foot.html">8</a></sup>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >Private Monopoly with Government
Oversight<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >This alternative consists in establishing a
single national laboratory or certified body which would conduct
the oversight and review of drug and device development programs
and applications for marketing approval under the supervision
of the FDA. The primary benefit of such a system would be that,
relative to the present system, a private body would have an incentive
to operate efficiently and to innovate in the review process to
a degree that the present system does not. This presumes, of course,
that some of the gains from innovation could be retained by the
private body. The primary disadvantage of this process is that
the continuation of government veto power would leave the present
system little changed. For example, the private monopoly right
could be revoked by the FDA if the monopolist deviated substantially
from the preferences of the bureaucracy which runs the present
system. So, at best, private monopoly with government oversight
would represent  only a modest improvement over the present system.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Moreover, such a system brings with it a host
of problems familiar to students of public utility regulation.
How would the private monopoly be chartered? How would it set
prices for its services?  If simply left to its own devices, the
private monopoly laboratory would charge monopoly prices for its
services where &quot;price&quot; is construed to be some combination
of money cost and waiting time for certification services.  Such
monopolistic behavior would retard the review process relative
to a more competitive arrangement for the provision of testing
services.  Any attempt to regulate the private monopoly would
rest upon issues similar to those raised in public utility regulation.
Would the monopoly right be rebid, say, every ten years? Would
there be extensive and detailed price regulation? What regulatory
biases and gamesmanship would result? <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This morass of regulatory issues can be avoided
by having more than one certified body to which firms can turn
for services. And unless some sort of economic justification,
such as economies of scale, can be found, there is no compelling
reason to have a single monopoly laboratory with government oversight.
Such a system would be cumbersome, and while perhaps exhibiting
better behavior than the present system of government monopoly
in terms of innovation and cost control, there would not likely
be that much difference between the two in practice.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >A simple model of a monopoly laboratory is
presented in the appendix. The moral of this analysis is simply
that the regulation of a private monopoly certification service
with respect to the provision of safety services, even assuming
a benign overseer with a sole interest in consumer welfare, would
be quite complicated. And while there are examples of such systems
in the private sector (the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations),
it is not easy to see how such a scheme could be applied to the
case of medical products. Regulation of a private monopoly is
difficult and problematical in any event, so that there is no
reason to expect the case of drugs and devices to be any different.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >Government Monopoly with Contracting
Out<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >This system of institutional review would maintain
FDA pre-market approval for new drugs and devices, but contract
out the actual certification programs. This is roughly equivalent
to what has been done to date by the FDA from time to time at
every level of the system except final approval.  It is also equivalent
to other government procurement programs under which specified
products or services are purchased from qualified contractors.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Contracting out is quite different from the
system described below as government oversight with competing
private laboratories. In the case of contracting out, private
contractors would bid to the FDA for business, while in a private
competing laboratories model, product sponsors would solicit the
services of private laboratories directly. In either case, the
FDA would regulate the private contractors or the private competing
laboratories.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The distinction between the two systems is
important. Undoubtedly, there are benefits to the contracting
out system relative to the present government monopoly with in-house
certification by the FDA. Private contractors could be expected
to be more efficient and innovative than government in-house reviewers.
Such incentives could reside, for example, in the concept of a
&quot;regulatory lag.&quot; Where equally reliable testing and
review procedures can be performed at lower cost, profits on a
given contract will improve. There are thus persistent incentives
to improve the design and review of product development programs
under contracting out that do not exist under the present system.
Over time, contracting costs will fall as firms pass along the
savings in bids for future work. Contracting out would also increase
the speed of the review process (as it could be done concomitantly),
and more drugs and devices could be reviewed at any point in time,
with consequent beneficial feedback for firms' investments in
research and development.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The other side of the coin, however, is that
government contracting carries with it a host of incentive and
other problems which have been studied in detail in the literature
(see Scherer 1964; McCall 1970; and Baron, 1972). It is not always
clear, for example, that competitive bidding yields the least-cost
supplier of services. Moreover, there have been a host of problems
associated with cost overruns. Also, the bureaucracy created by
delegating to the outside, and then reintegrating the results
into a review process that has always been beyond the agency's
managerial ability to control, simply increases complexity and
plays to FDA's weaknesses. For such reasons it is more likely
that the benefits of government contracting can be obtained without
the associated costs by adoption of a system of private laboratories
which would compete directly for the business of drug and device
firms. Such a system is closely akin to certain models in the
EU and several European countries, and is discussed in more detail
in the next  two sections.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >Competing Private Firms with Government
Oversight<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >This institutional arrangement would consist
of maintaining a final governmental review over new drugs and
high-risk devices, while relying upon competing private firms
for  sponsor oversight and certification services.  These private
certification firms would do a lot more than simply issue certificates.
They could perform a range of functions, currently performed by
the FDA, that are needed in order to be able to certify.  This
procedure is seen in the present European system for medical device
certification, so that examples of how such a system would work
can be drawn from the European experience. This model is also
analogous to the way in which the Underwriter's Laboratory works
in the United States; a discussion of the Underwriter's Laboratory
is thus also in order.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The European medical device system embodies
a set of standards which devices must meet. Although only a small
fraction of devices need to be regulated as drugs are regulated
(i.e., need to have a pre-market approval), it nevertheless is
instructive to examine how European device regulation works for
the entire range of devices.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In order to meet the required standards, manufacturers
are allowed a great deal of flexibility. For some low-risk devices,
manufacturers are allowed to self-certify that their products
meet the necessary standards. This &quot;light-touch&quot; regulation
requires only that the manufacturers, in addition to meeting strict
manufacturing and quality-control standards, maintain records
as to the reliability of a device and be available for questioning
should a problem develop.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >For higher-risk products manufacturers must
seek certification from third-parties, the so-called &quot;notified
bodies.&quot; Examples of such bodies, or private laboratories,
are BSI in Great Britain, TUVs in Germany, and KEMA in the Netherlands.
 Notified bodies supply certification services to firms, based
on analyses and oversight that they do in the form of testing
products and inspecting manufacturing systems. Approval of a product
by a notified body is tantamount to government approval:  the
product can then be marketed.  The notified bodies themselves
are subject to regulation by government with respect to their
operations as certifiers. In addition, as in the United States,
there is post-introduction reporting of adverse incidents. Such
incidents must be reported by manufacturers and users, and in
cooperation with national government authorities the manufacturer
makes an appropriate decision with respect to correcting problems
or taking the product off the market.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Thus, the European system relies upon elements
of self-certification for low-risk devices, third-party certification
for higher-risk devices, and post-market surveillance of adverse
incidents. The role of government in this process is limited to
standard-setting, regulation of the third-party certifying agencies,
scrutiny of the clinical development program, and dealing with
adverse incident problems once products are in the marketplace.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The effects of this system have been salutary.
Approval times are considerably faster in Europe -- 250 days as
compared to 820 days for a PMA review in the U.S. (Wilkerson Group,
1995.)  And there is no evidence that the European system produces
less safe outcomes than the United States system. It is therefore
possible that a system based on the elements of self-certification
(subject to government standards) and third-party certification
can produce a marked improvement over the government monopoly
system presently in place in the U.S. Indeed, the FDA has proposed
a trial of the use of third-party certification for low-risk devices.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >It is not a great leap to extend the European
system from devices to drugs. The U.S. requires a cumbersome IND
filing before first human testing while the U.K., for example,
does not.  At the market-approval stage, the review authority
in the U.K. gives more responsibility to a committee of independent
medical experts who have a consulting relationship to the agency.
 Moreover, the FDA, being the only regulator in the U.S. drug
market, necessarily acts differently than regulatory agencies
in, say, the U.K. and Germany. In the case of the EC's decentralized
 registration procedures, each national authority must compete
with 11 other national regulatory agencies in the EU, each agency
being concerned with the price of medicinal products in its domestic
market due to their respective government's role in the provision
of health care services.  It is also worth emphasizing that the
European agencies are fee-based. They thus have a meaningful profit
motive which arguably drives them to provide speedier and more
efficient reviews of new drugs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT >The Underwriter's Laboratory<BR>
</FONT></I>
<P>
<FONT >There is a certification system in the United
States for various products and equipment which operates in a
fashion  similar to some aspects of the European system for medical
device review. This system is typified by the activities of the
Underwriter's Laboratory (UL), and is worth considering in some
detail.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The UL is a large, not-for-profit organization
that certifies over 14,000 types of products using over 650 standards
(a &quot;standard&quot; is a detailed specification for a product
class that may run to many pages).  In addition to electrical
appliances and equipment, the UL also certifies automotive and
mechanical products, fire-resistant building materials, bullet-resistant
glass, and OSHA-designated &quot;hazardous location&quot; products,
among many others.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The UL tests and certifies products which present
inherent potential hazards to life and property. Except in special
cases, the UL does not offer an effectiveness mandate, but is
only concerned with safety issues. The exceptions are life-safety
products such as fire extinguishers and smoke detectors. In these
cases performance issues are also considered. The UL has never
underwritten any risk of the products that they certify. The business
of the UL is information; they are solely a testing and certifying
body.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The UL is completely private and independent.
There is no statutory or court-ordered requirement that forces
manufacturers to seek UL approval. Such activity is a purely voluntary
act on the part of manufacturers. The UL holds no <I>de facto</I>
or <I>de jure</I> monopoly on safety certification. In the United
States there are several competing standard-setting laboratories.
Not all laboratories use the UL's standards, but there is a high
degree of similarity among the competing standards. The UL is
much larger and older than any of its competitors and holds the
dominant position in the market. The primary regulator of the
UL and its competitors is the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >As noted above, the UL publishes over 650 standards
(the guidelines under which they test and approve products). These
standards are known to manufacturers in advance and cover specific
end-products. New standards are written according to the evolution
of market demand. As the demand for UL certification increases,
the UL formulates initial guidelines outlining their testing procedure
and the criteria products will have to meet to receive certification.
This information is distributed to interested bodies, such as
councils of manufacturers, insurers, and consumers. The UL asks
for comments and criticisms from these organizations, amending
their approach as necessary. This process results in a &quot;proposed
standard&quot; which undergoes the same scrutiny as the preliminary
information. The process evolves into &quot;published standards&quot;
which are made available to manufacturers. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >UL approval is not equivalent to governmental
approval. Ultimately, the use of products is still governed by
law, frequently under the jurisdiction of local inspectors, such
as the Fairfax County Fire or Building Inspector. In theory, and
perhaps in practice, local codes can ban a UL-approved product
or order its removal. In practice, such actions are extremely
rare.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >No form of legal mandate requires a product
to display a UL approval mark. However, many retailers are reluctant
to carry products lacking UL approval, and, occasionally, insurers
may deny liability coverage for unapproved products. As in the
textbook case of an investment in a non-salvageable asset, all
concerned parties benefit from the transaction, and firms, insurers,
and the UL all have incentives to maintain high quality standards.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The certification process begins when a manufacturer
delivers a batch of product to the UL. The UL informs the firm
of the standard under which they will test the product. If the
manufacturer agrees to continue, the UL prepares a safety report
and offers a &quot;procedure&quot; to be kept by the manufacturer
at his facility. The procedure lists the specific building materials
of the sample batch, as well as the manufacturing procedure, and
so on. The firm cannot deviate from the procedure, or they will
lose UL approval. The UL has field inspectors who visit manufacturers'
facilities to insure that the procedure is being followed.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The fee that the UL charges for its services
is based on a cost-of-testing approach, and depends on the testing
required by the particular published standard that covers the
good in question. Cost is also affected by the manufacturer's
choice of materials used in the product. If it is manufactured
using mostly UL approved materials, testing is less costly than
otherwise. The UL charges a flat fee for its field inspection
service and charges for its inspectors by the hour.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Notwithstanding all the discussion of the UL's
independence and the discipline imposed on the UL by the market,
it faces a specific regulatory burden. In fact, the UL is an actual,
working example of a competing laboratory with government regulation.
The UL and its direct competitors are certified by OSHA as &quot;nationally
recognized testing laboratories&quot; (NRTL), in accordance with
specific statutory guidelines. OSHA offers certification to any
laboratory that can meet its standards. The standards are not
arbitrary, and are available from OSHA.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The UL's direct competitors are also NRTLs.
Not all NRTLs are standard-setting bodies. Many use the UL's standards
directly, and offer some compensating differential in cost or
ancillary services to attract business. Some set their own standards
and testing protocols, independent of the actions of the UL, though
there do not seem to be great differences among the competing
standards. Typically, the UL's direct competitors are smaller,
newer, and for-profit enterprises. The UL's not-for-profit status
is likely the result of its curious history and inception. Since
its beginning, the UL's stated mission has been &quot;testing
for public safety.&quot; Though the UL has received revenue to
defray the costs of testing, its activities were always deemed
to be a public service. The UL maintains this position (over the
complaints of its competitors), and this history motivated the
UL to change its status to a not-for-profit organization.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >No other country uses UL standards, but most
foreign countries have their own certifying bodies, testing laboratories,
and standards. There is no set of bilateral or unilateral reciprocal
agreements with respect to UL standards. However, there are &quot;memoranda
of understanding&quot; between the UL and many of its foreign
counterparts. Though these agreements do not call for accepting
the certification of an overseas laboratory, they are reciprocal
on many levels, and in many instances the standards are similar
across national boundaries.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The UL's relationship with Canada goes beyond
a memorandum of understanding. The UL is certified by the National
Standards Council of Canada to test products for use in Canada
under standards specifically written for Canada. All products
approved for Canadian consumption bear the UL mark. The UL's Canadian
standards are similar but not identical to the UL's U.S. standards.
The UL is currently involved in writing common standards for the
United States and Canada.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The UL has not been exposed to excessive liability
concerns. There have been few lawsuits brought against the UL,
and these have been considered to be weak. The UL is occasionally
subpoenaed in connection with a lawsuit brought against a manufacturer,
but it provides no expert witnesses or any trial support. The
fact that the UL, as an independent third party, has certified
a product does not make the UL jointly liable for that product's
performance in the field. Neither does UL certification attach
the UL to manufacturer negligence. Basically, the UL answers two
questions: one, has the manufacturer taken the appropriate safeguards;
and two, was the product batch sent to the UL for testing found
to be safe? The UL mark signifies that the sample sent for testing
was found to be safe under a published standard, and the UL expects
that further products manufactured in the same manner using similar
materials are also likely to be safe. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The UL model, of course, is not a perfect fit
for the purposes of new drug and device review and certification.
 More is involved in drug and device approval than simply testing
a batch of products according to some manufacturer's standard.
 This is obvious.  Nonetheless, given the legal right to do so,
it is possible then the UL could seek to expand its capabilities
to be able to perform these functions.  This could involve the
retention of qualified experts to make judgments according to
the necessary standards.  In other words, both the UL and the
FDA can test a product according to specifications, but neither
the UL nor the FDA can test a drug's efficacy and safety.  Rather,
they would have to evaluate the evidence  by first checking that
it was obtained correctly and that it is accurate and truthful,
 and then that it has been interpreted correctly and satisfies
the law.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Both the European system for devices and the
UL illustrate the potential gains from applying a private certification
system in the United States to new devices and drugs. When coupled
with careful regulation of the certification industry and its
incentives, the private supply of testing services can potentially
provide as much  or more safety and effectiveness as the present
system, while speeding the flow of new drugs and devices into
the medical marketplace.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > </FONT>
<P>
<FONT >These private bodies could do a great deal
more than simply certify new products.  They would perform a scientific
review function to ensure the accuracy and truthfulness and interpretation
of results such that the existing law is satisfied.  Privatizing
this function and devolving it from the FDA has many advantages,
not the least of which is to afford the opportunity to bring the
very best scientists into the process of evaluating the safety
and effectiveness of new medical products. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Moreover, as discussed earlier in the analysis
of self-certification systems, there is little basis to expect
a &quot;race for the bottom&quot; out of this system. The FDA
would have regulatory oversight over the private laboratories
and certifiers, as well as review authority over their recommendations.
Such factors, as well as market incentives to maintain reputational
capital as a competent testing organization, would insure a healthy
evolution of private certification laboratories.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >Competing Jurisdictions<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >One way to look at the problem of institutional
reform of the FDA, building upon the example of the EU, is to
suggest th
<h2>I. Istitutional Alternatives for the Regulatio
evolution of EU institutions and their faster approval times may
reflect the reality that the individual country processes for
drug and device review must compete with one another, and such
competition has beneficial effects.  In the decentralized drug
review procedure of the EU system, sponsors can choose the national
agency to which they submit first.  This has resulted in intense
competition among the national agencies.  Indeed, Great Britain's
agency has done a marketing tour of the United States touting
its fast response time and its competitive cost.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The FDA monopoly in the United States. is not
in a similar position to the European agencies. So linking the
U.S. process to those in other countries might well make the issue
of institutional reform moot. Countries could choose review institutions
as they saw fit, and jurisdictional competition would mold these
institutions over time to comply with constituent interests. Jurisdictions
and firms which were effective would receive more revenue from
drug approvals, and so on. Obviously, jurisdictional competition
involves both costs and benefits, and it is a big leap to imagine
that the United States would be willing to enter a simple international
agreement under which products approved in other countries could
be marketed in the United States But some such linkage may be
desirable to support genuine institutional reform in the United
States<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Indeed, the European model provides at least
two implications for the United States  First, Europe's national
interagency competition within the EU is a model of how competition
between private certifiers could work in the United States  Second,
Europe's governmental certifying bodies can be set up in competition
with the FDA by appropriate international recognition agreements.
 Some further analysis of this latter type of action would be
useful.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The textbook case for jurisdictional competition
is the example of corporate law in the United States Each state
has evolved an individualized chartering system for corporations,
and have competed for corporate chartering revenues for more than
100 years. Over this time Delaware has become a preferred jurisdiction
in which to incorporate, but firms can incorporate in any state.
The issues, then, are why does this system of corporate chartering
work so well and could it be extended by analogy to the process
of drug and device review?<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The definition of a corporation is simple --
it is a business entity characterized by share ownership and limited
liability. The first component simply constitutes a contract between
a firm and its equity suppliers, and how a state governs this
relationship does not affect any other state's relations with
the firm. Jurisdictional reciprocity, therefore, is contingent
upon each jurisdiction recognizing limited liability as desirable.
Consequently, reciprocity does not require agreement on any other
issues, and jurisdictions are free to experiment with various
forms of corporate governance and judge their efficiency by how
the market reacts. States subsequently become responsive to the
changing needs of business, and as long as they do not respond
with severe alterations of the limited-liability principle, they
can change virtually any other component of corporate governance
without affecting the reciprocity agreement.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Defining a corporation is possibly easier than
defining what constitutes a &quot;safe and effective&quot; drug.
In agreeing to reciprocity, jurisdictions would state that they
accept the definitions of other jurisdictions, and in the case
of drugs and devices, that they approve of the testing methods
employed. A reciprocity agreement, therefore, would inevitably
require some minimum standards for membership. These standards,
however, constrain the ability of jurisdictions to differentiate
their processes, and thereby allow the political market to signal
its preferences. While jurisdictions in the market for corporate
charters differentiate their products through the governance components,
a market in drug and device certification has no margins upon
which to operate except for an agreed-upon concept of the definition
of  safety and effectiveness and the methods for testing.  Changes
in this definition necessarily alter the nature of reciprocity.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Moreover, rather than the continuous and infinite
relationship between corporations and their domiciles, drug and
device approvals entail discrete transactions. Firms do not evaluate
where they should submit all of their products, but consider each
case individually. If a jurisdiction changes its process, firms
can submit future products to other jurisdictions. In a worst-case
scenario a race for the bottom could occur as each jurisdiction
simply rushed to approve the products manufactured within its
borders and export them to other markets. Nonetheless, this is
not what appears to have happened among European countries. To
the contrary, competition among countries has led to the evolution
of outstanding agencies for drug and device review and approval;
there has not been a race to the bottom.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >International agreements are, of course, not
easy to negotiate, and reciprocity in drug and device approval
would be no exception to this rule. Most, if not all, of the benefits
of jurisdictional competition, however, could probably be obtained
by adopting a system with competing certifiers in the United States
Indeed, a rigorous private certification industry in the United
States would likely strengthen the prospects for linkage with
the systems of other countries, as such a change in policy would
put our system on par with the structure of the emerging European
systems.</FONT><sup><a href="foot.html">9</a></sup>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >Conclusion</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >The weight of the evidence presented here suggests
that improvements are clearly possible in the drug and medical
device certification processes as they currently operate in the
United States The evidence that certain European systems perform
better than the FDA process is compelling. The model of government
oversight with private certifiers has several advantages. It would
bring state of the art scientists and scientific methods into
the process of drug and device certification. It would foster
innovation in drug and device evolution, oversight, and certification
procedures, leading to lower costs, faster approval rates, and
enhanced safety and effectiveness. It would cut down on bureaucratic
red tape and delay. It would not require any changes in the existing
legal standards applied by the FDA. For these and various other
reasons, movement to a system of competitive certification performed
by private laboratories and testing groups commends itself for
the consideration of policymakers.<BR>

<CENTER><B><FONT >Appendix: The Private Monopoly Laboratory
<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >Suppose that the monopoly laboratory has an
oversight committee. For purposes of clarity, naively assume that
the committee members are interested in maximizing consumer welfare,
and, therefore, political variables are ruled out. The monopolist
is assumed to be a standard profit-maximizer producing certifications
at a price, P. Price is a function of the number of new drugs
certified, ND, and safety, s, of the drugs. Thus, P=p(ND,s). Total
cost is a function of safety and the number of new drugs certified,
and increases with respect to safety. Thus, C=c(ND,s). <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The oversight committee is interested in maximizing
consumer welfare, W, and, therefore, would like the area under
the demand curve and above production costs to be maximized, i.e.,
it would like the monopoly to maximize:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > (1) <IMG SRC="IMG00004.GIF">.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The first-order conditions are:<BR>

<FONT > (3) <IMG SRC="IMG00007.GIF"></FONT>
<P>
<FONT >where subscripts denote partial derivatives.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The monopolist, however, is interested in maximizing
profits and therefore attempts to maximize:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > (4) <IMG SRC="IMG00008.GIF"><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Its first-order conditions are:<BR>

</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > (6) <IMG SRC="IMG00010.GIF"><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >From (3) the oversight committee is concerned
with the impact of increased safety on all consumers (from the
integral), while from (6) the monopolist is concerned with the
impact of increased safety on the marginal consumer. Furthermore,
when <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > (7) <IMG SRC="IMG00011.GIF"></FONT>
<P>
<IMG SRC="IMG00012.GIF">
<P>
<FONT >the monopolist undersupplies safety from the
oversight committee's point of view. The committee then arguably
orders the monopoly to increase the safety of its certified drugs
at the cost of reduced monopoly profits. It is important to note,
however, that it may not be possible for the oversight committee
to discern the consumer-maximizing output decision. The monopoly
may exaggerate the impact of increased safety on price, P<SUB>s</SUB>,
to the extent that the inequality in (7) becomes an equality.
In this case the oversight committee believes that the appropriate
level of safety is being provided, when in reality the level of
safety is not as high as desired. Even when the committee has
oversight on the level of profits realized, the monopoly may engage
in X-inefficiency, and thus still provide lower than desired levels
of safety.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Dorfman and Steiner (1954) modeled a monopolist
whose product demand is a function of price and advertising. Consider
this approach but, instead, focus on safety rather than advertising.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Thus, the monopolist maximizes:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > (8) <IMG SRC="IMG00013.GIF"><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >where the cost function is now additive in
new drugs and safety and, as before, ND=N(p,s). Maximizing with
respect to p and s, the first-order conditions are:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > (9) <IMG SRC="IMG00014.GIF"></FONT>
<P>
<FONT >and</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > (10) <IMG SRC="IMG00015.GIF"><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >where, again, subscripts denote partial derivatives.
Denoting E<SUB>p</SUB> = -ND<SUB>p</SUB>[p/ND] as the elasticity
of demand with respect to price and E<SUB>s </SUB>= -ND<SUB>s</SUB>[s/ND]
as the elasticity of demand with respect to drug safety, then,
as Dorfman and Steiner showed, (9) and (10) can be rearranged
as<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > (11) <IMG SRC="IMG00016.GIF"><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This is a version of the Dorfman-Steiner condition.
For a given E<SUB>s,</SUB> the greater the elasticity of demand
with respect to price, E<SUB>p</SUB>, the smaller the safety to
sales of new drugs ratio. Given that the demand for new drugs
is highly inelastic with respect to price, which in the case of
life-threatening diseases may the case, safety relative to total
sales of new drugs will be high, other thing equal.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Nonetheless, given the simplistic nature of
this analysis, the oversight committee may get less safety than
the amount desired. This is the case when the marginal valuation
of safety to the average consumer is greater than that of the
marginal consumer. In an attempt to maximize profits the monopolist
undersupplies safety, according to the oversight committee. Also,
when the price elasticity of demand for new drugs is high relative
to the safety elasticity of demand, the level of safe certifications
relative to total sales of new drugs is low. And, as stressed
above, by exaggerating the impact of safety on price, the monopoly
can still maximize profits by undersupplying certification of
safe new drugs, and even if the committee regulates its profits,
the monopoly may still undersupply safety by engaging in X-inefficiency.
The point is simply that even with a benign oversight committee
bent on maximizing consumer welfare, regulation of the monopoly
laboratory easily becomes a quagmire. And, undoubtedly, the more
realistic the model is made, the deeper the quagmire.<BR>

<h2>Therapeutic Drugs and Biologics</h2>
by Henry I. Miller and William M. Wardell<P>

<CENTER><B><FONT >EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</B></FONT></B>
<BR>
</FONT></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >The goal of this proposal is to speed the delivery
of safe and effective new drugs and biologics to patients in need.
 To achieve it, the plan proposes changes in the current regulatory
system that will facilitate early clinical research, increase
the efficiency of drug development and its regulatory oversight,
and reduce the overall time and cost required for safe new drugs
to reach the market.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >The Need For Reform</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >The existing system for regulating drugs in
the United States has been fairly successful, as narrowly defined
by an assurance that products admitted to the market are reasonably
safe and effective.  By broader measures, however, it has failed.
The development and approval of new drugs and biologics is too
slow and costly.  The present system wastes the resources of both
the pharmaceutical industry and the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA). In the name of safety and effectiveness at any cost, the
development of many promising new therapies is prevented, and
the availability of new products delayed.  An unnecessary burden
is being borne by patients, by U.S. industry, and by the national
economy -- unnecessary because safety and effectiveness do not
have to be sacrificed for innovation and the introduction of greater
efficiency. We need a wiser balance of objectives.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The total time required for drug development,
from synthesis of the molecule to marketing approval, has more
than doubled -- from 6.5 to 14.8 years -- since 1964.  The time
from an Investigational New Drug (IND) filing to a New Drug Application
(NDA) approval now averages 8 years.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >FDA has raised the regulatory burden on drug
sponsors by continually introducing new requirements and policies
without due regard for their potential to hinder the delivery
of new and innovative therapies to patients who need them.  The
drug-development system in the United States has become the most
ponderous and expensive in the world.  The cost of bringing a
drug to market now averages more than $350 million. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >There has been broad consensus for nearly three
decades that reforms are necessary, but few have been implemented,
and none expeditiously or widely.  Occasional attempts by FDA
to streamline regulation are little more than window-dressing.
 The inability of the executive branch of government -- including
FDA -- to reform itself necessitates legislative action to change
the scope and procedures of oversight.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Numerous official panels and inquiries over
the past 30 years have proposed remedies for the deficiencies
of the system.  The most important and consistently repeated of
these recommendations has been the need for <I>management and
structural reforms</I> that would transfer some tasks currently
performed internally by FDA to outside experts and organizations.
 While FDA has at one time or another delegated most of its review
and evaluation functions (except final sign-off for approval)
to outside experts or entities, the delegation has been piecemeal
and disorganized; partial privatization has never been integrated
in a way that could create an efficient overall system. The plan
proposal corrects that and creates a system with these recommended
management and structural reforms at its core.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Other reforms recommended repeatedly have included
a lesser role for FDA in the scrutiny of early-phase clinical
investigations and the wider use of accelerated approvals coupled
with continued post-market surveillance.  These recommendations
are adopted, explicitly or implicitly, in the current proposal.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >The Proposal<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >While rationalizing and enhancing the efficiency
of the process for developing, reviewing, and approving new drugs
and biologics,<I> the proposal maintains the existing legal requirement
for pre-market demonstration of safety and effectiveness</I>.
 Preserved as well are FDA's enforcement powers and the agency's
authority to issue the final sign-off approval for product marketing.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The key changes are these:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >1) Primary responsibility for managing the
Investigational New Drug (IND) filing, oversight of the clinical
program, and New Drug Application (NDA)/Product License Application
(PLA) review will be transferred from FDA to Drug Certification
Bodies (DCBs).  The DCBs, which can be private- or public-sector
(university) organizations, for-profit or non-profit, will be
certified by FDA and staffed -- as required by the language of
the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act -- with &quot;experts qualified
by scientific training and experience.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >2) The sponsor will submit NDAs (or PLAs) to
the DCB, not to FDA.  After evaluating the NDA, the DCB will submit
the results of its review (if favorable) to FDA. The FDA Commissioner
will then have a finite period of time in which to accept the
DCB's recommendation for approval (which, legally, is a &quot;rebuttable
presumption&quot;) or to deny approval. If approval is denied,
at the discretion of the sponsor and the DCB, a review may be
undertaken by an independent appeals panel reporting to the Secretary
of HHS.  All parties, including the FDA, will be expected to accept
the decision of the Secretary. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >These reforms will encourage greater efficiency
and cost-effectiveness via competition among the DCBs, improvements
which will affect both the tactics and the strategy of drug development
and approval.  DCBs' competition for sponsor-clients will favor
those that perform effective problem-solving for the client, manage
the oversight and review efficiently, and perform reviews in a
timely way.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Economic pressures will encourage the DCBs
to be competent and timely, and to cultivate a reputation for
integrity -- traits that will be most highly prized by clients.
 The enormous complexity and myriad alternatives at various steps
in the drug development process provide the DCB opportunities
to add value to the client's product.  Just in the realm of clinical
trials, the choice of endpoints, indications, and trial design
strongly influences the size, time and cost of development programs;
therefore, there is significant potential for savings of time
and money.  Subject to the legal standard of safety and effectiveness,
DCBs will be encouraged to devise innovative and more efficient
ways of developing drugs and getting them approved.  This strategic
competition among DCBs and cooperation between DCBs and sponsors
will transform the drug development and approval process and redress
the current trend of increasing time and costs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >More efficient management of the oversight
and review process will reduce the time and costs required for
drug development and approval.  In this way, greater numbers of
new drugs will become available to patients in a timelier fashion.<BR>

<FONT >American patients and physicians need and deserve
more rapid access to greater numbers of safe and effective drugs.
 It is clearly in the public interest to encourage pharmaceutical
innovation -- the discovery, development, and marketing of new
therapies.  Over the past 35&nbsp;years however, regulations originally
designed to protect public health by preventing the sale or use
of unsafe or ineffective products have themselves become impediments
to progress in the field.  The evolution of pharmaceutical regulation
has moved inexorably in one direction: toward more stringent,
burdensome, and intrusive oversight as FDA has assumed more and
more responsibilities and power.  As the Presidents Biomedical
Panel concluded in 1976, the delays and costs that the FDA's protective
systems impose on drug development constitute a &quot;hazard to
public health&quot;<sup><a href="foot.html">1</a></sup>.  In 1973 the president's Science Advisory
Committee concluded that it may &quot;be worth adapting US regulations
so that not even a single important new entity introduced into
selected foreign countries during the previous year fails to become
available in the US.&quot;<sup><a href="foot.html">2</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This proposal seeks to restore a more appropriate
balance between regulation and innovation - but without jeopardizing
product safety - by facilitating the development and regulatory
review of pharmaceuticals.  Public health will be maintained and
even enhanced.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >Why is Innovation so Difficult and Costly?</b></FONT>
<P>
<FONT >It is a fact that the development and approval
of new drugs in the United States takes too long.  The total time
for drug development, from discovery or synthesis of the molecule
to NDA approval, has more than doubled since 1964, from an average
of 6.3 years, in the period 1963-1965 to 15.0 years, in the period
1990-1992.  The time from IND filing to NDA approval (the most
highly regulated portion) now averages 8 years in the United States
-- two years longer than in Europe.  There have been dazzling
advances in discovery, such as the cloning of receptors and the
use of transgenic animals for both toxicology testing and human
disease models. But regulatory burdens have hampered innovation,
compromised the availability of new therapeutics, and wasted the
resources of both FDA and the pharmaceutical industry.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >As the time required for drug development has
lengthened, the average &quot;effective patent life&quot; - that
is, the time remaining from NDA approval to expiration of the
main patent -- has declined correspondingly, a double disincentive
for sponsors considering drug development. Effective patent life,
nearly 14 years in 1966, declined to less than seven years in
the early 1980s.  The Waxman-Hatch Patent Restoration Act of 1984
restored, at most, half of this loss, and required other substantial,
costly concessions from the research-based drug industry, notably
earlier approval of generic drugs.  It is the effects of these
and other disincentives to research that are being seen in the
consolidation of the research-based industry today.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Analyses of innovation in the U.S. pharmaceutical
industry show that its research output, as measured by the introduction
of INDs for new chemical entities (NCEs), declined rapidly and
significantly after the 1962 law was enacted.  The decline occurred
in several phases.  There was an immediate decline (by more than
50 percent) in the early 1960s.  Then for a decade the output
was fairly constant, but in the mid-1970s it fell again by another
50 percent.  It recovered somewhat in the early 1980s.  However,
in the last decade it has declined again, although in the 1990s
the shortfall in NCEs has been compensated by &quot;new biotechnological
entities&quot; (NBEs), the corresponding biotechnology product
candidates.  (DiMasi et al, CPT 1994)<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >It would be overstating the case to argue that
all impediments to innovation derive from regulation.  The process
of innovation -- a lengthy and complex one involving discovery
and development, including clinical testing -- is formidably difficult
and expensive.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In addition to the scientific and technological
hurdles, there are new obstacles in marketing. Over the past decade
there have been fundamental changes in the nature of the market
for pharmaceuticals and in the product criteria needed to succeed
there. The days of the manufacturer selling a new drug directly
to individual physicians are rapidly vanishing.  Typically, today's
manufacturer of a new drug must convince a panel of experts who
comprise a managed-care organization's formulary committee --
a discerning and informed consumer -- of the importance of the
product.  Their evidentiary criteria can exceed those of FDA and
they may call for evidence (such as pharmacoeconomics and comparative
efficacy) that is outside the sphere of the drug-approval process.
 The utilization of new (and other) drugs is becoming more tightly
controlled, and the outcomes are being recorded and analyzed in
ways that were previously inconceivable. There is, for example,
a growing use of computerized control of patient selection, indication,
dose, and duration of therapy.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Thus, manufacturers' products and claims, and
the evidence supporting them, must meet very high standards to
be accepted in today's marketplace.  In this exacting environment,
government regulation of the product-development process should
not add burdens that are no longer necessary.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >One fundamental cause of the ever-increasing
regulatory burden in the United States is  that regulators strive
to avoid, at any cost, approving a product that might turn out
to be harmful, even if this policy causes them inevitably and
systematically to delay or neglect to approve products that promote
patients' well-being.  Consequently, FDA has continually imposed
new requirements and assumed new regulatory responsibilities that
have inexorably increased the length of the approval process and
the costs involved.  Because this phenomenon goes to the fundamental
malaise of FDA's monopoly over drug evaluation and review, it
is worth exploring further. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >There exists a marked asymmetry, or imbalance,
between the two kinds of wrong decisions that a regulator can
make: (1) a decision to approve for marketing a drug or other
product that turns out to be harmful (an &quot;error of commission&quot;),
or (2) a decision to deny, delay or inhibit approval of a drug
or other product that would be beneficial (an &quot;error of omission&quot;).
 Putting this another way, it is the difference is between permitting
something bad to happen and not permitting something beneficial
to happen.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Several kinds of asymmetry exist in the two
situations.  Two classic examples of errors of commission are
the approval of the tranquilizer thalidomide by some European
regulatory agencies in the 1960's and the approval of the &quot;swine
flu&quot; vaccine by FDA.  Mistakes like these are highly visible.
 They bring down the wrath of the media, the public, and legislative
oversight bodies.  Often both the developers of the drug and the
regulators who allowed it to be marketed are criticized and punished
-- witness the modern-day pillories in Congressional oversight
hearings and the press.  A regulator's career might be damaged
irreparably by the good-faith but mistaken approval of a product.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Errors of omission, in the form of unreasonable
demands or requirements, can delay or prevent entirely the marketing
of an important new product.  But such errors of omission caused
by regulators' bad judgments, timidity or anxiety is often known
only to a few knowledgeable company and FDA insiders.  And if
the mistake precipitates a company's decision to abandon the drug,
both the regulatory misstep and the sequelae may be largely invisible.
 Moreover, there may be no direct evidence that the continuing
suffering of patients is avoidable -- or that the regulators are
culpable.  Too often FDA is allowed to &quot;err on the side of
safety,&quot; when that is merely a euphemism for committing an
error of  &quot;ommission.&quot; <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The changes in regulations proposed here are
intended, in part, to improve the balance between benefit and
risk, and between safety considered narrowly and patients' overall
welfare.  The plan will shift the balance toward encouraging product
development and permitting patients greater and timelier access
to the benefits of innovation.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >Positive Features of the U.S. System of
 Drug Development and Regulation</FONT></B>

<P>
<FONT >In proposing reform, it is important to understand
and preserve the virtues of the present system.  Industry, government,
academia, and medical practice all play a role in the scheme of
drug development, regulation, and use in this country.  This system
has substantially achieved two major goals: <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >1) protection of human subjects of clinical
research (through the IND process); and,</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >2) assurance that no product reaches the market
until proved reasonably safe and effective for its labeled use
(through the NDA process).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The major regulatory requirements governing
this process were instituted in 1962.  Over the past 35 years,
students of U.S. regulation have learned a great deal about the
nuances of the regulatory system and of FDA itself, including
which aspects work well and which need to be improved.   It should
be noted, however, that drug regulation, while important, is only
one of many important contributing factors in bringing new therapies
to patients.  Profound changes have occurred over the past three
decades in widely disparate parts of the system and in society.
Clinical research has advanced. The media has become more aggressive
and covered these subjects more fully.  Public sophistication
and awareness has grown.  Pharmaceutical marketing, tort case
law, and -- perhaps most important and powerful now and for the
foreseeable future -- the system of paying for medical treatments
have all changed dramatically.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Clinical research, for example, has many more
professional, full-time, career clinical researchers (including
MD/PhDs) than it did in 1962.  Since 1962, we have also seen the
advent of institutional safeguards, such as Institutional Review
Boards (IRBs).  Corporate operating procedures have been systematized,
as have corporate and government clinical-safety reporting and
analysis procedures. There is the new science of pharmacoepidemiology,
and innovations in patient care, such as skilled clinical research
nursing at research institutions, have provided yet another level
of expertise applied to clinical research. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In addition, various entities have become <I>de
facto</I> standard-setting organizations.  The newest ones, which
are rapidly becoming the most powerful, are managed-care organizations.
 As described above, these organizations exercise influence through
large-scale purchasing, control over their formularies, and drug
utilization review.  Formularies and drug utilization-review are
particularly powerful; physicians practicing within organizations
like HMOs are seeing their ability to prescribe increasingly constrained
or &quot;corrected&quot; by computerized &quot;governors,&quot;
in systems that perform overall integration of the medical record
for case management.  A physician might be prevented from prescribing
a drug if according to software filters it does not fit a patient's
listed diagnosis, or is excessive in dose or time of administration.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >While drug regulation has played a major role
in the elevation of standards to their present levels, these other
factors are essential and autonomous components that exist outside
FDA's  realm.  They are virtually independent, non-governmental
instruments that help to maintain research integrity, drug safety
and efficacy, and post-marketing surveillance.  Furthermore, FDA
is by no means the only world body that regulates drug approval
for safety and efficacy: a score of other countries (and now the
EU) have systems that perform reviews and achieve results that
are essentially similar to those of the United States -- and incidentally,
operate with staffs and budgets disproportionately smaller than
the FDA.  Indeed, as drugs become increasingly subject to these
various new controls before and after marketing approval, the
relative importance of FDA as a protector inevitably diminishes.
 This evolution must shape the reform of pharmaceutical regulation.
A regulatory system for the 21st century has to be different from
one crafted in 1962 when the problems were very different, and
the other elements of <I>de facto</I> regulation were almost non-existent.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >The History of Regulatory Reform<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT >FDA is responsible for regulating the testing
and marketing of all new human and veterinary drugs.  FDA's basic
authority is embodied in the 1902 Public Health Service Act; the
1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; and 1962 amendments
to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Public Health Service
Act mandates the <I>safety </I>regulation of biological drugs.
 The 1938 Act charged FDA with ensuring the <I>safety</I> of all
new drugs before they are released to the market (the NDA approval
process).  In 1962, partly in response to the thalidomide tragedy
in Europe, Congress imposed the additional requirement that a
new drug be shown to be <I>effective</I> as well as safe.  The
amendments also expanded the government's authority to regulate
clinical investigations of drugs (the IND process). Today all
preclinical and clinical research is conducted under FDA regulations
and policies.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >It is striking that for decades, debates about
regulatory reform have identified the same problems and the same
solutions have been recommended by panel after distinguished panel.
These eminent and expert panels, including the McMahon Committee,
the Lasagna Committee, the Edwards Committee, and the Council
on Competitiveness have recommended both broad changes and specific
improvements that would reduce the time, cost, complexity, and
unpredictability of the process, and thereby prevent the loss
of potential therapies.  Because the agency has been too slow
and obdurate in implementing most of these repeated recommendations,
reform must come from outside the agency, via legislative changes.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > </FONT>
<P>
<FONT >A particular advantage of our proposal (to
be described in Section II) is that delegating a portion of the
oversight responsibility to non-governmental entities introduces
two basic improvements simultaneously: (i) an element of competition
among DCBs for drug companies' business, which creates pressure
for greater creativity and efficiency; and (ii) a more appropriate
balance between risks and rewards, incentives and disincentives
than presently exists.  These basic elements derive from first
principles of management and regulation.  The proposed mechanism
also contains safeguards to assure the integrity of the process,
including high-quality reviews.<BR>

<h3>THE PROPOSED NEW SYSTEM:  REGULATION
OF DRUGS AND BIOLOGICS</h3>
<BR>
<FONT >The goal of the plan is to speed the delivery
of safe and effective products to patients who require them. 
To achieve that, changes in current federal regulation are proposed
that will facilitate early clinical research; increase the efficiency
of drug development and the constructiveness of its regulatory
oversight; and reduce the overall time and cost required for a
new drug to reach the market.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > </FONT>
<P>
<FONT >While improving the process for developing,
reviewing, and approving new drugs and biologics, this proposal
maintains existing safety and effectiveness standards by preserving
the legal requirements for pre-market demonstration of safety
and effectiveness.  Preserved as well are FDA's enforcement powers
and the agency's final sign-off authority to approve product marketing.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The salient aspects of this proposal are the
transfer of much of the responsibility for day- to-day IND oversight
and NDA review to non-governmental experts; support of the review
mechanism (DCBs) by user fees (via contractual arrangements between
sponsors and DCBs); and competition among the non-governmental
entities that will oversee the IND process and perform reviews.
 No single component of this proposal is completely new, but the
integration of these various elements into a drug oversight and
review system is accomplished in a novel way that is both logically
sound and empirically validated.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Our plan proposes changing the system of regulatory
oversight of drug development by transferring the primary oversight
responsibility (but not the final approval step) from FDA to non-governmental
entities, Drug Certification Bodies (DCBs),that are staffed by
the experts that the law requires to make judgments on effectiveness
and safety.  This transformation of the IND oversight and NDA
review process for  individual products in development will be
more comprehensive than other, similar proposals that would, for
example, delegate piecemeal various FDA functions such as review
of NDA filings.  Competition among the DCBs to provide regulatory
oversight services, combined with safeguards against conflicts
of interest and overeagerness to approve products, will create
a more efficient drug development process and promote innovation.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >The Drug Certification Bodies (DCBs)</b>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >DCBs will be certified by FDA to ensure they
have the technical, scientific, and managerial expertise necessary
to oversee and review particular specialties or categories of
products.  The DCBs' own imperatives to compete for clients, avoid
tort liability, and retain FDA certification are the fundamental
triad that will provide the impetus for high standards.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The corporate structure, geographic location,
and number of DCBs will be determined by market forces, as will
how many DCBs emerge and survive.  DCBs may choose, for example,
to be for-profit or non-profit; to be physically located in existing
centers of medical research or near centers of the pharmaceutical
or biotechnology industry; and to specialize in particular therapeutic
areas or drug types, or be  broadly qualified for a wide range.
 The regulatory process for obtaining licensure as a DCB could
be modeled on other complex health-related licensing procedures
such as the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations
(JCAHO).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >FDA will certify the DCBs to oversee most of
the drug development process (i.e., to evaluate and issue INDs),
oversee drugs in development, and review NDA applications.<sup><a href="foot.html">3</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >At the sponsor's option, the DCB may offer
advice on what is appropriate or required in a development program
to obtain NDA approval, but ultimate approval cannot (and should
not) be guaranteed. Nor should this be part of the contract. In
the end, the results of the physico-chemical, pre-clinical, and
clinical studies will provide evidence of safety and efficacy
-- and, therefore, an indication of likely approval. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Initially, DCBs will likely recruit from FDA,
industry, and contract research organizations (CROs) the scientific,
medical, and regulatory experts required for judgments on safety
and effectiveness. Experts may be needed in fields such as pharmaceutical
toxicology, pharmaceutical formulations, biopharmaceutics, drug
study design and analysis, clinical monitoring of therapeutics
and quality assurance, chemistry, and manufacturing.<B> </B> Because
these are specialized technical undertakings, the DCB will need
a broad range of scientific, medical, regulatory, and management
expertise. For this reason alone, qualifying for and retaining
FDA certification will be challenging.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >The Sponsor's Relationship with a DCB</b>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The product sponsor (usually a company) will
select a DCB from those certified for the respective product class
-- categories might include, for example, anti-hypertensive drugs,
psychotropic drugs, or vaccines.  Important factors in that choice
will include the perceived ability of the DCB to oversee a suitable
NDA program and the likelihood of a successful DCB review and
eventual FDA approval for its particular product.  Other factors
influencing the choice might include the DCB's geographic location;
reputation for service; experience with studies of comparable
size and complexity; and, fees.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Different sponsor companies will require widely
different degrees of interaction and service from DCBs, as happens
now with sponsor-FDA interactions.  Sponsor-DCB contracts will
reflect these differing needs.  The level of service required
will depend on factors such as the size and previous experience
of the sponsor (both generally and for the particular class of
drug); the intrinsic novelty of the product; the presence of difficult
issues of purity, potency, stability, or toxicity; and the size
and complexity of the clinical program.  Other issues will sometimes
be prominent; for example, in the case of important public health
products such as influenza vaccine, there could be a compelling
need for extremely rapid testing and approval. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The needs of the sponsor companies will determine
how many DCBs can ultimately be sustained by the U.S. drug development
process, and what their special features and location will be.
 <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >Role of DCB in IND Oversight and NDA Review</B>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Because the DCB will have primary supervision
over the IND, the IND submission will be made to the DCB, not
to FDA.  However, FDA will maintain its role in the national surveillance
of clinical safety of investigational drugs, as part of its responsibility
for all drug safety surveillance, as described below.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The contact between the sponsor and the DCB
will normally begin during preclinical development, well before
the expected start of clinical trials, just as sponsor-FDA interaction
often does now.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The DCB will advise on and evaluate the IND
filing and issue the IND when it is satisfied that the risk/benefit
considerations are appropriate for the commencement of  clinical
trials.  Following the granting of the IND and the IRB's (independent)
approval, the sponsor will be able to initiate the study, as at
present.  The DCB's close involvement with the sponsor will encourage
the identification and solution of problems during the pre-submission
period.  Little or no additional time -- the current 30-day waiting
period, for example -- should be needed to obtain IND approval.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The DCB will oversee the testing of the new
drug throughout its clinical research phases, concentrating on
issues of safety and efficacy.  The DCB will ensure that the sponsor
is in compliance with the currently applicable regulatory standards
(including GLPs, GCPs, and GMPs). The DCB will be responsible
for auditing the sponsor to ensure that standards have been met
in all areas and for certifying this compliance.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Once the sponsor and DCB have agreed that the
accumulated data on a product fulfill the legal requirement for
safety and efficacy, the sponsor will submit its formal New Drug
Application (NDA) to the DCB.  The DCB will be responsible for
certifying, through its regular site visits and audits of the
sponsor, that the original data are accurately recorded, analyzed,
and reported; that the data are suitably archived for future audits
if necessary; and, that the summary analyses and reports accurately
reflect the data.  The criteria for approval of the NDA will remain,
as they are now, safety and efficacy, as judged by experts (in
this case, the DCB's experts), according to the law.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Because of the DCB's continuous involvement
as the data supporting the NDA are accumulated -- a process that
has in past reform proposals been referred to as a &quot;developing&quot;
or &quot;self-reviewing&quot; NDA -- the evaluation and review
of a straightforward NDA will normally be completed rapidly after
its submission.  Also, because the DCB's report, like the NDA
itself, may be written as the NDA data are emerging, even difficult
issues to be addressed in the report -- such as marginal efficacy;
low therapeutic index; or problems with safety, stability, or
manufacturing -- will often have been identified and solved by
the DCB in the course of the IND.  Thus, a DCB's favorable recommendation
may often be issued with only a minimal additional &quot;NDA review
period.&quot;  Thus, the system will encourage a high level of
problem-solving, as the market learns to favor those DCBs that
offer competence, predictability, and a reputation for high standards.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The DCB's recommendation to the FDA for approval
of the NDA will summarize the evidence supporting a positive recommendation,
similar to (but with more detail than) the current Summary Basis
of Approval (SBA).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >Role of the FDA in IND Oversight and NDA
Evaluation</B>
</FONT><P>
<FONT >FDA will be responsible for certifying DCBs
and for overarching safety concerns.  The agency will not be involved
in individual IND programs unless there is a specific safety issue
that cannot be handled through the normal oversight of the sponsor
by a competent DCB.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >On safety matters, the DCB will oversee the
sponsor, but FDA will retain its responsibilities for national
oversight of safety matters, particularly those that involve information
outside the level of the individual drug, sponsor, or DCB, as
described in Section E, below. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >FDA will devote more attention than it does
now to clarifying, updating, and making public the criteria for
NDA approval in all therapeutic areas and indications.  As new
therapies and indications arise and as the old ones evolve, FDA
will participate in public forums with sponsors and DCBs to establish
new criteria or modify existing ones.  The goal of this important,
ongoing interaction among FDA, sponsors, and DCBs is to establish
and publicize the objective criteria for approval, and also to
foster a cooperative interaction among the parties.  The existence
of up-to-date, objective criteria will promote consistency between
DCBs for similar products.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >During the evolution of the IND and NDA evaluation
and approval, FDA will not normally be exposed to the developing
project in any detail (except for major or unexpected Adverse
Drug Events (ADEs, see below)).  However, the agency will be kept
apprised of which drugs are being studied through periodic reports
from the DCBs.  These reports also will include information needed
to monitor safety information and allow general oversight, such
as: INDs issued (name of drug and sponsor); ADEs; and milestones
(dates and numbers of patients in the clinical development phases,
for instance).  During the IND phase, FDA will not routinely have
contact with the sponsor, but may at any time inspect or audit
the sponsor, DCB, or any other component of the drug-development
apparatus.  An FDA inspection might be triggered, for example,
by a suspected problem involving safety that has been inadequately
addressed, or information that raises concerns about the integrity
of data from an investigator or institution. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Once the NDA has been sent to FDA with the
DCB's recommendation for approval, the agency has a fixed period,
for example 90 days, to review the recommendation.  During this
90-day period, the Commissioner can approve the drug or reject
the NDA for a specified cause (which, in effect, rebuts the &quot;rebuttable
presumption&quot; of the DCB's recommendation). The 90-day period
of review is not extendable and the Commissioner's failure to
act during this period is deemed to be assent to the drug's approval.
 If the NDA is rejected, the DCB or the sponsor can appeal the
decision (a process which in turn must be completed in a further
90 days). The appeal mechanism is described below.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >Clinical Drug Safety Oversight During the
IND</B></b>
<P>
<FONT >Safety oversight is largely unchanged in our
reform initiative.  We propose to keep intact the present national
system of pharmacovigilance administered by FDA, above the level
of the DCB. The current requirements and schedules for submitting
expedited and periodic safety reports will be maintained.  Under
the new system, reports will be submitted by the sponsor to the
DCB, which will transmit reportable ADEs to FDA.  FDA communications
(including any alerts based on safety data received by FDA from
U.S. or international sources) will be made to the DCB with a
copy to the sponsor.  In this way, the DCB will continue to have
primary oversight of the sponsor's handling of safety issues,
while FDA will maintain a broad purview.  In addition, FDA will
be able to obtain the safety data necessary for compliance with
international agreements on the reporting of safety data.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >To aid FDA's safety oversight, as already described,
the DCB will inform FDA periodically of the status of the INDs
it is overseeing.  The objective of these reports is primarily
to provide FDA with information necessary for its oversight of
the safety of human subjects -- not to allow the agency to create
an active or primary role for itself in the routine oversight
of clinical programs.  (A secondary objective is to permit FDA
to plan its review of DCB recommendations.)  It is expected that
most issues that arise in the course of drug development will
be resolved by sponsor-DCB interactions without involving FDA.
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<b><FONT >Status of the Regulations Implementing the
Law</b></b>
<P>
<u>Safety and Effectiveness</u> 
<FONT >Currently, a drug's sponsor must demonstrate
its safety and effectiveness through controlled clinical tests
that are themselves closely regulated by FDA.  Before a new drug
can be marketed, FDA must determine that -- based on the data
submitted -- the drug is effective and reasonably safe for use
under the drug's labeling. It is important to note that Congress
did not create exact definitions of what is meant by &quot;effectiveness&quot;
or &quot;safety,&quot; and that the law does not supply such definitions.
 Rather, the law provides for these judgments to be made by <I>experts</I>
&quot;qualified by scientific training and experience.&quot; 
Nowhere is it specified that such experts should be exclusively
FDA employees, although that is how the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act has come to be interpreted.  This interpretation is, in effect,
just a custom that the FDA has imposed and the industry has come
to accept, even though it was not the intent of Congress as expressed
in the law; in fact, this interpretation goes beyond the letter
of the statutes.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Our proposal for reform conforms more closely,
we believe, to the original intent of the existing statutes and
regulations governing safety and effectiveness.  Some proposed
changes, such as the identity and location of the &quot;experts&quot;
required by law, will prevent the statute from being distorted
or over-interpreted.  No change is proposed in the existing legal
standard for premarket approval, which requires evidence of safety
and substantial evidence of effectiveness derived from adequate
and well-controlled investigations as evaluated by experts qualified
by scientific training and experience.  The DCB experts' recommendation
that a drug should be approved will be, in legal terms, a rebuttable
presumption that the drug meets the law's safety and effectiveness
requirements.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<U><FONT >The Regulations That Implement the Law<U><P>

<FONT >We believe that the current set of regulations
that implement FDA's enabling statutes, and the agency's interpretations
of them, are in many places unnecessarily complex and extend beyond
what the law -- and scientific principles -- require.  These can
and should be simplified, to be made more consistent with the
intent of the law.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In order to provide for an orderly transition
to the new system and to maintain consistency with internationally
harmonized formats, the current regulations will initially be
retained.  However, as experience is gained with the new system
during the transition period, a standing committee with representatives
from FDA, sponsors, and DCBs will revise and simplify the regulations
in order to streamline the IND/NDA process while keeping it consistent
with the requirements of the law.  Such revised regulations could
be converted to a status in which adherence to them by a sponsor
would be sufficient, but not necessary, to meet legal requirements.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >As discussed above, there must be ready access
to up-to-date standards of evidence needed for NDA approval. 
For the proposed system to work effectively, FDA, working cooperatively
with DCBs and sponsors, will continue to produce and update the
standards that apply.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >The Appeals Process</B><P></b>
<FONT >Two major problems have systematically prevented
industry from voicing complaints about the process or content
of FDA's decisions.  First, there has been no venue of independent
appeal for a party with a valid complaint; and second, there has
been a justified fear of agency reprisals.  Although there is
an FDA ombudsman, he currently reports to the Commissioner. Some
would look to the FDA advisory committees, but they are selected
and managed by FDA and address only issues presented to them by
FDA staff. There is no independent forum.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Our proposal creates an appeal mechanism for
DCB-FDA disagreements on product approval  -- an independent,
standing advisory committee of experts, the Committee on Medicines
Oversight, at the level of the office of the Secretary of the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  It will have approximately
10-15 distinguished members representing patients, medical practice
and medical science, and the drug and device industries.  The
members of the committee will represent a wide spectrum of scientific,
medical, and regulatory expertise, and ad hoc members can be invited
as necessary.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The committee will hear appeals of FDA rejections
of a DCB recommendation, and will advise the Secretary, who will
instruct the Commissioner on the committee's decision.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >Facilitating U.S. Approval of New Drugs
Approved Abroad</FONT></B></b>
<P>
<FONT >The efforts at international harmonization
of drug-approval standards and registration packages among advanced
countries implies that, in the future, other countries' evaluations
may not need to be completely duplicated in the United States.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >We propose to allow the direct submission to
FDA of an approved registration package from Europe (the European
Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA) or certain national regulatory
agencies, such as Great Britain's Medicines Control Agency). 
A foreign agency would function like a domestic DCB in that it
would submit summaries of the data on which its approval was based,
and the 90-day time period would apply for FDA to review and approve
or reject this package for the United States.  Alternatively,
the sponsor of a drug that had obtained (or was en route to) foreign
approval could contract with a U.S. DCB to review and submit its
NDA.<BR>

<h3>ACHIEVING THE GOALS OF REFORM</h3>
<P>
This
proposal outlines necessary reforms in the system of new drug
approval. It takes into account the need for high standards of
public safety and also the often-ignored need of patients to have
access to beneficial, sometimes potentially life-saving, new therapies.
It preserves some of the salient features of the present system,
and changes those that have become inefficient and unnecessarily
burdensome. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The existing system 1962 and, resistant to
reform, has become more complex and troubled over time.  Fundamental
changes have taken place in government, industry, and society
that call for a new, less antagonistic and monopolistic system
that fosters innovation, without sacrificing safety.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >At present, approximately 85 percent of New
Drug Applications are ultimately approved. However, given the
staggering costs and the length of time invested in drug development,
that 15 percent failure rate is extremely costly.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This proposal offers a constructive approach
to responsible and responsive regulation.  While retaining responsibility
for the oversight of safety, the FDA sheds its day-to-day involvement
with the development of specific new drugs, leaving that to government-certified
organizations, the DCBs.  The new role for FDA emphasizes clarifying
and developing criteria for various categories of new drugs; monitoring
the DCBs; and working with the DCBs to eliminate wasted effort
and assure that when the recommendation for approval of a drug
is made to FDA, the agency will be able to approve it.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Under the proposed system, the spur to greater
efficiency and cost-effectiveness will be competition among the
DCBs, which will affect both the tactics and the strategy of drug
development and approval.  DCBs competition for sponsor-clients
will favor those that perform effective problem-solving for the
client, manage the oversight and review efficiently, and perform
reviews in a timely way.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Economic pressures will encourage the DCBs
to be competent and timely, and to cultivate a reputation for
integrity, because these traits will be most highly prized by
clients.  The enormous complexity and myriad alternatives at various
steps in the drug development process provide the DCB opportunities
to add value to the client's product.  Putting this another way,
just in the realm of clinical trials the choice of endpoints,
indications, and trial design strongly influences the size, time
and cost of development programs; therefore, there is vast potential
here for savings of time and money.  Subject to the legal standard
of safety and effectiveness, DCBs will be free to devise innovative
and more efficient ways of developing drugs and getting them approved.
  This strategic competition among DCBs and cooperation between
DCBs and sponsors will transform the drug development and approval
process and reverse the current trend of increasing time and costs.

<h3>APPENDIX:  DRUG DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATION
-- THE CURRENT SYSTEM</FONT></h3>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>How a Drug is Developed</B>
<P>
FDA does not test drugs itself.  The development
of a new drug is undertaken by a sponsor, which -- because of
the time, complexity, and costs of the process -- is almost always
a pharmaceutical company.  (Occasionally -- in about 5 percent
of approved drugs -- a federal agency, university, hospital, or
research institution may discover compounds, obtain patents, and
start development, but such entities almost never have the resources
and specialized skills to take a drug through the full development
process to obtain NDA approval themselves.) <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Development of a new drug generally begins
with the testing of a great many chemical compounds in in-vitro
screens. (In the case of biologics, fewer substances are screened).
 Then they are screened in laboratory animals in order to determine
possible toxicity and therapeutic activity. These preclinical
investigations define the pharmacological and toxicological properties
of the agent and help to predict the initial dose range for humans.
 Many of the agents screened are eliminated from further development
at this stage, usually because they are ineffective, toxic, or
not absorbed.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
When animal studies suggest that a compound
may be therapeutically promising, the sponsor moves on to Phase
I clinical testing, which introduces the drug into humans for
the first time.  The sponsor must submit to FDA an application
called an IND (Investigational New Drug filing).  FDA has 30 days
to review the submission to ensure that the product is reasonably
safe for research in human subjects.  If FDA does not formally
object, the sponsor may begin clinical testing after the 30 days.
 Uncertainty at this stage about whether FDA will object, request
more data, or require different test procedures is highly disruptive
and has often caused U.S. companies to use more predictable locations
abroad for initial human testing.   (Currently, a significant
fraction of U.S. companies' Phase I testing is performed abroad,
mainly in Great Britain and elsewhere in Europe.  This has occurred
to such an extent that the Phase I testing industry in the United
States has collapsed; many facilities are now closed.) <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Clinical studies are loosely divided into three
phases that represent a logical progression, or scale-up, of study
size and complexity.  Phases I and IIA, together considered to
be early clinical research, involve, respectively, the first administration
of a drug to normal human subjects and the first test of efficacy
in patients.  Phase I may involve as few as 20 subjects, and Phase
II a few dozen to a few hundred.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Usually after early Phase II (Phase IIA), a
decision is made as to whether the drug offers sufficient promise
to warrant larger-scale (Phase IIB-III) clinical trials in order
to develop the product for marketing.  Only about a third of the
drugs that start in human testing survive to enter Phase III.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
In Phase III, research expands to examine the
following:  (i) the drug's effectiveness and side-effects in a
larger number and varied types of patients and, often, a wider
range of disease conditions (&quot;indications&quot;); (ii) the
types and incidence of side-effects; (iii) the potential for long-term
use and interactions with other drugs; and (iv) other information
useful for drug labeling. Phase III trials may involve from several
hundred to several thousand patients.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Although Phase III trials cost more money and
take more time than any other single component of the development
process, the earlier phases -- and the effect of ponderous regulation
of them -- are perhaps even more important in determining the
time and cost of drug development.  There are high attrition rates
(failures) of drug candidates at the early stages when little
is known about them, and there are far more products under investigation
at the early stages. These facts are often overlooked, but they
underscore the key importance of obtaining greater efficiency
and cost reductions in the earlier phases of the drug development
process.  Such improvements would facilitate early decisions to
drop compounds that will ultimately fail (that is to say, the
majority), in order to focus resources on the few that will succeed.</FONT>
<P>
 </FONT>
<P>
Although the process is described in terms
of phases, development is really a continuum of research.  In
practice, the phases of drug testing are not sharply differentiated.
 Often, studies described as Phase I may have to be done or repeated
after Phase II -- or even Phase III -- has begun. For instance,
after advanced clinical testing in adults, the sponsor might seek
a pediatric indication; new Phase I and II studies might then
be needed in children.  Often, many different types of studies
are done simultaneously for different purposes; they are not neatly
divided into phases.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
The distinction between &quot;early&quot; and
&quot;later&quot; clinical research, is the junction between Phase
IIA and Phase IIB.  Through Phase IIA (sometimes called &quot;exploratory
development&quot;) researchers are looking for evidence of &quot;clinical
proof of concept,&quot; and expenditures through this point are
generally less than about $15 million per compound, most of which
fail.  After Phase IIA, drug testing enters an intense program
focused primarily on amassing evidence of efficacy for ultimate
NDA approval.  Expenditures for Phase III programs are in the
tens of millions to  hundreds of millions of dollars.  (One cardiovascular
drug reached the quarter-billion dollar mark in a multicenter
Phase III clinical trial -- and failed).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>The NDA Submission and Review Process</B>
<P>
When the pre-clinical and clinical testing
demonstrate that a drug is effective as labeled and reasonably
safe, the sponsor files a New Drug Application (or Product Licensing
Application -- PLA -- in the case of biologics) with FDA, seeking
approval to market the drug.  The NDA, which consists of many
volumes and often hundreds of thousands of pages, describes fully
the reports of all investigations and statistical analyses performed
to demonstrate the drug's safety and effectiveness.  It also includes
a description of the drug's composition, the methods, facilities,
and controls for the manufacturing, processing, and packaging
of the drug; samples of the drug and its components; and a draft
version of the proposed labeling.  NDAs are reviewed by the Office
of Drug Evaluation in FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research
(CDER), and PLAs are reviewed by the Center for Biologics Evaluation
and Research (CBER).  The reviews are performed by teams consisting
of physicians, pharmacologists, chemists, statisticians, and other
specialists.  By statute, FDA is required to approve or disapprove
an NDA within 180 days, although this rarely happens.  The 180-day
period can be extended by &quot;agreement&quot; between the sponsor
and FDA.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Ultimately, most NDA submissions (at present
85 percent; DiMasi et al., CPT 1994, 1995) are approved by FDA,
but frequently final approval comes only after considerable time
and negotiation and requires additional submissions of data. 
Also FDA may narrow the sponsor's initial request, approving fewer
indications for the drug's use and imposing more restrictive labeling
requirements. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
After passage of the 1962 Amendments, the time
required for FDA review and approval of NDAs rose from six months
in 1962 to an average of three years in 1975 and remained there
throughout the 1970s and 1980s (ranging as high as four-year averages
at times); after years of protest by the industry and efforts
by FDA and industry, the time required has now been reduced to
two years or less.  The sharpest reduction occurred recently with
the implementation of user fees (but before most of the additional
personnel approved by PDUFA -- the User Fee Act -- had been hired
by FDA, suggesting that most of the effect was due to a management
change that could have been implemented at any time during the
preceding 25 years).  Much has been made of FDA's efforts to reduce
the time of NDA review, but even substantial reductions, while
desirable, will not greatly affect the overall 15-year total time
required for drug development and review.  Provided gross excesses
in review times do not reappear, the proper focus now should be
to reduce the time and costs of the total development and approval
cycle, and this will need more strategic attention to the endpoints
required for approval, as well as to the tactical efforts needed
to achieve them.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Meanwhile the number of new INDs has continued
to rise, but the trickle of products approved for market that
emerge from the end of the pipeline has remained stagnant at 20
to 30 per year since the 1960s.  In 1994 the FDA approved only
22 new drugs (compared to 25 the previous year).   The numbers
of applications submitted to FDA for marketing approval of biologicals
has been declining.  Thus, the flow of products from the first
clinical trials through to ultimate marketing approval has slowed.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
These are some of the reasons that this proposal
seeks to make improvements throughout the period of regulated
clinical testing, rather than focusing predominantly on expediting
NDA review and approval.<BR>

<h2>III. Medical Devices</h2>
by Ralph A. Epstein<P>

<CENTER><B>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
<b>Operating Plan for a New Medical Device
Certification Process</b>
<P>
The new plan involves the interaction of three
groups: the manufacturer who bears the ultimate responsibility
for their product; a private Device Certifying Body (DCB), engaged
by the manufacturer to provide independent certification of critical
manufacturing processes and of products; and, the federal authority
(FDA), which maintains responsibility for public safety by ensuring
the competence of the DCB's, keeping the system honest by enforcing
compliance with law, and by maintaining a universal system of
postmarketing surveillance. The system is characterized by the
reliance on objectively defined law, clear standards and well-defined
responsibility. It relies, as far as possible, on private, non-governmental,
organizations. The plan follows in most details the workings of
the European Union medical device regulatory system.<BR>

<P>
<b>Basic Principles</b>
<P>
All medical devices are classified, using clear
objective criteria, into one of four classes (I, IIa, IIb, and
III). Devices presenting the highest level of risk and complexity
are placed in the higher numbered classes. Devices may be marketed
only if they conform with a comprehensive series of &quot;essential
requirements.&quot; As far as possible, such conformance will
be ensured in practice by adhering to relevant internationally
agreed upon objective standards. For all classes of devices, except
Class I, a DCB must audit the manufacturer periodically to confirm
such conformance. The number of areas audited and the stringency
of the audit depends on the class. However, in all cases, the
manufacturer has a choice of methods to demonstrate conformance.
In general, the manufacturer can either demonstrate conformance
of his quality assurance systems or conformance of the product
itself. Combinations of these two routes are permitted. In all
cases the manufacturer must have a system for monitoring and acting
upon reports of a device malfunction after sale. In addition,
the FDA acts as a central repository of such information when
it involves a serious threat to patient safety as it is in a position
to monitor the investigation of such events, especially when it
involves similar situations arising with several manufacturers.
The FDA may, for cause, require that a device be withdrawn from
the market if the manufacturer has not ensured that it meets the
essential requirements or if the DCB has not acted competently.
In addition, criminal charges may be brought in the case of fraud
or criminal negligence.<BR>

<P>
<b>Self-certification by Manufacturers</b>
<P>
Device innovation is often characterized by
many small incremental changes. A method of rapid certification
of new products facilitates this. For Class I devices, the manufacture
may self-certify conformance with the essential requirements.
Manufacturers who maintain a total quality assurance system may
self-certify new Class IIa and IIb products between the periodic
audits of their DCB. Class III products always require premarketing
design approval by a DCB. In addition, for Class III devices,
the FDA must be notified 90 days prior to marketing to allow time
for the FDA to elect to review the appropriateness of the certification
process.<BR>

<P>
<b>Good Manufacturing Practice Inspection</b>
<P>
The FDA's current auditing of manufacturers
for Good Manufacturing Practices would be replaced by the DCB's
certification of the manufacturer's quality assurance systems.
Such certification would often exceed FDA standards as it could
include certification of design quality assurance. It would also
be done far more frequently than current FDA inspections. <BR>

<P>
<b>Labeling and Off-Label Use</b>
<P>
Currently, a new application to the FDA is
needed whenever the manufacturer claims a new use for a device,
or even if the manufacture wishes to distribute reprints from
the scientific literature concerning a new use. This is often
so expensive and time consuming that the manufacture &quot;ignores&quot;
such clinical practice, resulting in widespread &quot;off-label&quot;
uses. In most cases, in the new system, the manufacture will be
able to self-certify such label changes (subject to the unusual
monitoring by the DCB).<BR>

<P>
<b>Timeliness of Approvals</b>
<P>
The current system has been characterized by
such slow approvals that venture capital has become scarce and
manufacturers have been forced to relocate critical operations
offshore. Approvals under the new system should be expeditious
as competitive forces will only tolerate DCB's capable of responding
to the market.<BR>

<P>
<b>International Harmonization</b>
<P>
Since the new system will be based on standards
and procedures virtually identical to those of the European Union,
it should be possible for a manufacturer to obtain both U.S. and
European approval using the same documentation and inspections.
In can be predicted that organizations will be certified both
as U.S. DCB's and European &quot;notified bodies.&quot; <BR>

<P>
<b>Transition</b>
<P>
A two to three year transition period is envisioned
so that devices under current review can be approved under the
existing system, if the manufacture should so elect. After a suitable
period, only products certified under the new system would be
allowed access to the market.

<h3>AN OVERVIEW OF THE MEDICAL DEVICE
INDUSTRY</h3>
<P>
<FONT >The medical device industry has been dominated
by the United States for many decades. American medical devices
are recognized world wide for quality and innovation. Of the approximately
50 billion dollars in United States production, 20 percent is
for the export market, producing a positive balance of payments.
Nevertheless, the industry's competitive position is very fragile
and our world leadership is now seriously threatened -- not from
external competition but from internal policy. Not only can this
have serious economic consequences, but the quality of our medical
care itself is now in jeopardy. A review of the unique circumstances
of the medical device industry, with an emphasis on the factors
which have fostered innovation, is useful in order to appreciate
how we have come to this state.<sup><a href="foot.html">1</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In sharp contrast with the pharmaceutical industry,
the medical device industry is composed of a very large number
of quite small companies. In 1993, 88 percent of medical device
companies had less than 100 employees.<sup><a href="foot.html">2</a></sup> Although there are a few
companies with sales exceeding a billion dollars, the typical
medical device company has sales in the 50 to 100 million dollar
range. Of the over 7,000 domestic medical device manufacturers,
approximately 1,000 are development companies with no sales at
all!<sup><a href="foot.html">3</a></sup> There are only about 150 firms with sales exceeding $100
million. The very largest medical device companies have total
sales equal to that of rather small pharmaceutical companies.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >One reason device companies are small is that
the market itself is extremely fragmented. For example, the total
U.S. market for anesthesia machines of all types is only about
3,000 units a year with a total value of barely $150 million.
 In contrast, the United States market for systemic antibiotics
or antihypertensives is five <I>billion</I> dollars per year.<sup><a href="foot.html">4</a></sup>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Medical device companies aggressively pursue
research and development. In 1993, while the median R&amp;D expenditure
as a percent of sales for all manufacturing companies was 4 percent,
it was over twice as much, 9 percent, in the medical device industry.
For companies with sales in the 5 to 20 million dollar range,
it was over 20 percent.<sup><a href="foot.html">5</a></sup> Not surprisingly, a very large proportion
of significant innovation occurs in the smallest companies with
the least sales. Venture capital is generally attracted to these
companies in the expectation that the product or the company itself
will be sold to a larger company in 5 to 7 years. While radically
new technologies attract public attention, much of the long term
improvement in medical devices comes from a myriad of small incremental
innovations which cumulatively, over time, have great clinical
relevance. The FDA is required by current law to review over 6,000
applications for such &quot;new&quot; devices a year, representing
the entire range of modern technology.<sup><a href="foot.html">6</a></sup> Much of the impetus for
such product improvements comes from physicians in the field.
Unimpeded communication between physicians (and other health care
personnel) and manufacturers is a requirement for much of this
activity. Likewise the ready availability of sites for device
testing in a clinical environment, generally in our academic health
centers,  is essential for innovation.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Finally, the relatively small size of the market
for any given medical device and the need for specialized material
for many of these devices results in device companies being critically
dependent on suppliers outside the medical device industry. Thus,
the device may be dependent on a small amount of a specialized
plastic, an esoteric metal or an electronic component. The device
company seldom has the resources to develop such materials, and,
because of the small amount needed, there is little financial
incentive for the supplier to provide them. Their availability
is a byproduct of a larger, non-medical, market.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The medical device industry is thus dependent
on multiple factors beyond its direct control, and any breakdown
of these complex relationships will threaten innovation by the
industry. Time is the biggest threat. Small companies have little
reserves and are dependent on fresh infusions of capital or on
current sales (if they exist) to finance innovation. Delays, or
the fear of delays, or even the unpredictability of delays, can
lead to financial disaster and frighten off venture capital. Such
delays can be related to the time required by the FDA to approve
clinical trials or to approve the device itself, among many other
causes. The delays interact. Thus increased FDA requirements for
human investigations, as the FDA attempts ever more to force the
device industry into a pharmaceutical regulatory model,<sup><a href="foot.html">7</a></sup> make the
system more sensitive to delays in approvals of such investigations.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >There are other delays in a new product's revenue
stream, not directly related to the FDA, that are very hazardous,
particularly to small companies. Since many innovations are incremental,
it is often good medical practice to use the device for routine
patient care while it is still the subject of human investigation.
If the investigational nature of a device prevents payment for
the device by government or private payers, the financial integrity
of the company may be threatened. Furthermore, if such use threatens
payment for any associated hospital or physician care, the health
care facility and physician may find it impractical to continue
interacting with the manufacturer, destroying a relationship needed
for continued product improvement. Finally, as U.S. academic health
centers come under more financial pressure, the opportunities
for clinical investigations decrease. The result of these forces,
coupled with FDA delays in approval of clinical investigation
protocols, has become  a potent incentive for American companiesto transfer some or all of their advanced research and development
offshore.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The product liability environment further discourages
innovation. First, many companies simply will not support the
development of new products in those areas of medicine most subject
to product liability suits, such as contraception and implantables,
as well as in entire medical specialties, such as anesthesia.
Where there were once many companies competing in the anesthesia
machine field, there are now only two significant U.S. based companies,
both of which are highly dependent on the export market. If, as
is the case, companies are liable under the doctrine of strict
liability (i.e., for any harmful event) rather than for actual
negligence, many companies will avoid intrinsically high risk
areas of medicine. The problem is compounded by the prevailing
doctrine of joint and several liability. Even if a company's actions
are only slightly related to an injury, it can be held liable
for the entire cost, if others sharing the liability have inadequate
assets. For this reason, a company producing a high-tech material,
(e.g., a plastic), which is used mostly for non-medical products,
has a huge incentive to prevent medical device companies from
having access to the material. The potential profit from the sale
of a small quantity for medical use is far less than the potential
liability or even the costs of litigation.<sup><a href="foot.html">8</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Finally, third party payers are limiting the
technology for which they will pay. To survive in a managed care
environment, the industry must have the flexibility to turn its
innovative energies to developing products which, if they do not
dramatically improve health care, lower its costs.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > </FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Currently, innovation is threatened by all
these factors simultaneously. The industry is over-regulated and
preyed upon by the plaintiffs' bar. Hobbled by these forces, it
is threatened by a new payor environment which has redefined what
sort of innovation is valued. The result in the last several years,
has been a decrease in the availability of venture capital; a
decrease in new product introduction in the United States; a trend
toward moving research and development as well as some manufacturing
to Europe; a decrease in the traditional growth of employment
opportunities in the United States; and, ultimately a delay in
the availability of medical technology needed by American patients.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Current market forces seeking to rationalize
health care costs should, if anything, provide new opportunities
for innovation in all areas of medicine, including medical devices.
Innovation would simply become more related to optimizing the
relationship of benefit to cost. Innovations in medical technology
can just as easily decrease as increase costs. The current revolution
in minimally invasive surgery and the consequent decrease in hospitalization
and time for recuperation is just one example of the potential
for technology to significantly decrease costs. Such market forces
are simply part of the environment that normally modulates the
growth and direction of an industry. Government regulation has
the perverse effect of constraining industry from rapidly adapting
to this changing environment.<BR>

<h3>DEVELOPMENT OF REGULATION OF THE
MEDICAL DEVICE INDUSTRY</h3>
<P>
<FONT >Close government regulation of the medical
device industry is a relatively recent phenomenon in western democracies.
In the United States, there was little regulation before 1976
aside from laws that ensured that devices performed in accordance
with their labeling<sup><a href="foot.html">9</a></sup>. In Western Europe, regulation varied from
country to country. There was little direct governmental regulation
in some countries, such as Great Britain. Even in those European
countries with a long history of regulation, such as Germany,
regulations existed largely to ensure that manufacturers met standards
which had been approved by a consensus of the relevant manufacturers
and users.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >All this radically changed in the United States
with the passage of the 1976 Medical Device Amendments to the
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The law first provided for <I>general
controls</I> which would apply to all devices. This included control
of labeling (and, by extension, advertising and all other communication
between manufacturers and users) and manufacturing (and, by extension,
design) practices (GMP's- good manufacturing practices). Devices
whose safety could be assured by general controls alone were to
be placed in Class 1. The law envisioned that the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) would devise a process to approve many hundreds
of <I>performance standards</I>. Devices whose safety could be
assured by their also adhering to such performance standards were
to be placed in Class 2. Finally, Class 3 was reserved for those
few devices which would require a case by case prospective analysis,
as their complexity precluded assurance of safety by adherence
to performance standards and general controls alone. A manufacturer
wishing to market a Class 2 device needed only to notify the FDA
90 days in advance of its intention to sell the device and document
that it met the relevant performance standards. Marketing was
permitted if the FDA did not formally object in this time frame.
Only Class 3 devices required explicit premarket approval. The
premarket approval (PMA) application was to be acted on by the
FDA in no more than 180 days.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >All existing devices (preamendment devices)
were to be temporarily approved and placed, by category, into
one of the three classes, as determined by broadly based panels.
Section 510(k) of the law allowed the manufacturer to petition
the FDA to approve a new device that was &quot;substantially equivalent&quot;
to a device manufactured before 1976 and place it into the same
class as the predicate device. It was permitted to demonstrate
that a new device was substantially equivalent to a postamendment
device which in turn was substantially equivalent to a preamendment
device. At some future date, Class 3 preamendment devices and
new devices which were approved under section 510(k) as being
<I>substantially</I> <I>equivalent</I> to Class 3 preamendment
devices were to be subject to a PMA.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Finally, new devices which were not substantially
equivalent to a preamendment device were automatically placed
in Class 3 (thus requiring premarket approval through a PMA process).
There was provision in the law for reclassification to a lower
class if it could be shown that compliance with general controls
alone, or general controls and performance standards, could ensure
safety.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The intent of this somewhat convoluted scheme
was to exercise no more governmental control than appeared necessary
and to avoid delays in introducing useful products to the market.
In fact, in the early years of device regulation, expeditious
approval was the rule.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >However, the system contained the seeds of
its own destruction. Congress and the FDA grossly underestimated
the complexity of the very heterogeneous medical device industry.
Although the formulation and approval of performance standards
were the foundation of the classification system and thus the
heart of the regulations, the FDA approved virtually no performance
standards. The reclassification process for new devices proved
so cumbersome that the FDA essentially did not implement it. 
Although Congress had provided no guidance as to how to determine
&quot;substantial equivalence,&quot; the 510(k) process was heavily
relied upon and the FDA made every effort to stretch the law to
the breaking point and accept claims of substantial equivalence
in order to allow manufactures to bring devices to the market
quickly and predictably. The FDA apparently gave little or no
thought of ever requiring PMA's for preamendment devices. In summary,
the law was &quot;working&quot; because FDA did not implement
it as written<sup><a href="foot.html">10</a></sup>.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The dissociation between the law as written
and as applied became more and more apparent throughout the 1980's,
resulting in major investigations of the FDA by congressional
oversight committees, the General Accounting Office and the Office
of Technology Assessment<sup><a href="foot.html">11</a></sup>. With the law clearly not being implemented
literally, it was easy to reap political benefits by criticizing
the operation of the FDA. Scandals at the FDA concerning generic
drugs compounded the problem and the prestige of the agency fell.
The FDA became more cautious, approval times began to lengthen
and enforcement began to take on an arbitrary character. However,
the 1976 statute, even though it was often vague and incomplete,
precluded serious governmental abuse. By 1990, Congress was ready
to act. It appears that the possibly of deregulation was not considered.
Instead, the Safe Medical Device Act of 1990 vastly increased
the power of the FDA over the device industry.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Several aspects of the 1990 act require comment.
The FDA was granted the authority to impose large civil penalties.
The act required postmarket reporting by users, distributors,
importers and manufacturers of device failures which did or might
cause harm. This requirement for redundant reporting of even the
suspicion of device failure resulted in the FDA being inundated
by more data than it could analyze or even catalog, especially
as the fear of penalties created a great incentive to complete
reports of marginal events. More fundamentally, the 510(k) process
was significantly modified. No longer could a company, even in
principle, market a device 90 days after submitting a 510(k) &quot;notification&quot;
(unless the FDA formally objected). Now the company was forbidden
to market the device until it received explicit <I>premarket</I>
permission from the FDA, in the form of a formal &quot;order.&quot;
The act defined &quot;substantial equivalence&quot;, the basis
for a 510(k) decision,  very broadly and explicitly allowed a
device to be placed in Class 2 on the basis of &quot;substantial
equivalence&quot; even if it had different technological characteristics
from its predicate device. The lack of FDA approval of performance
standards to allow for an objective approval process was implicitly
acknowledged by simply no longer requiring  them. However, these
provisions, rather than liberalizing the process, further constrained
it as the FDA was given the unlimited power to devise any &quot;special
controls&quot; that it deemed necessary for Class 2 devices. The
combination of these changes effectively removed any difference
in principle between Class 2 and Class 3 devices as now premarket
approval based on the judgement of FDA reviewers, rather that
conformity with recognized standards, was needed for both.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Further medical device amendments followed
in 1992. They were for the most part technical corrections or
provided time extension for the FDA to complete previously required
work. They did not change the essential character of the power
of the FDA.<BR>

<h3>THE CURRENT STATE OF THE MEDICAL
DEVICE INDUSTRY</h3>
<P>
<FONT >After many years of healthy growth, the medical
device industry is approaching a crises. Although the difficulties
that some companies are having are the result of their inability
to adapt to the new market realities which require more cost effective
solutions, much is due to misdirected governmental policy. The
direct and indirect effects of inappropriate product liability
policies are very important but are beyond the scope of this paper.
We will concentrate here on the consequences of FDA regulation.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The time it takes to obtain FDA approval of
a new product and the perceived capriciousness of the process
is perhaps the greatest concern to industry. The 1976 law envisioned
that the 510(k) approval process should not take longer than a
total of 90 days.  It is actually quite difficult to interpret
FDA's own statistics concerning their review times. Their preference
for using median times masks the fact that the time is skewed
sharply toward long reviews. Often they cite time at the FDA rather
than total elapsed time, not counting the time the manufacturer
needs to provide additional data required by the reviewer. Finally,
the FDA may &quot;stop the clock&quot; and this may not be noted.
Although the FDA believes that only counting the time at the FDA
is &quot;fair,&quot; the essential point is that if the entire
process is slow there is a severe disincentive to the development
of products in the United States. By 1992 the <I>median</I> elapsed
time was 90 days. The median then increased to 164 days by 1993,
dropping back to 155 days by 1994.<sup><a href="foot.html">12</a></sup> However, by definition, half
the approvals take longer than the median. In 1994, 5% of the
510(k) applications were taking more than 613 days, or almost
2 years.<sup><a href="foot.html">13</a></sup>  The net result is an increase in R&amp;D costs and a
costly delay in the time needed to develop a positive cash flow.
During early 1995, it was apparent that the FDA, under extreme
political pressure from a wide variety of sources, had reassigned
resources, softened their policies and made a significant effort
to decrease review times and introduce more reason into the process.
It is difficult to predict how long this will last.  However,
it should be noted that there is now nothing in the statute that
requires or provides an incentive for  expeditious reviews<sup><a href="foot.html">14</a></sup>.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >&quot;New&quot; Class 3 devices require that
the FDA approve a PMA. The 1976 statue allowed for a 180 day period
for FDA review. In 1990, the mean total elapsed time for an FDA
decision was 609 days. By 1993 it had climbed to 823 days. This
represents an extraordinary delay and has been a principal reason
the number of PMA submissions dropped from 78 to 40 during that
period<sup><a href="foot.html">15</a></sup>.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Most PMA submissions and an increasing number
of 510(k) submissions require the generation of clinical data.
The law requires approval of clinical protocols by an Institutional
Review Board (IRB). For clinical studies posing potential hazards,
the FDA must also prospectively approve the details of the study.
There have been many anecdotal reports of long delays in such
approvals. As such clinical studies, by necessity, take place
before submission for device approval, these delays are additive
to the delays in the 510(k) and PMA approval process.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >There have been some attempts to quantify the
costs of these delays<sup><a href="foot.html">16</a></sup>. The Western European regulatory system
has been used as a benchmark. In general, our best estimate is
that European approvals require less than half the time of American
approvals. In fact, in many circumstances, European companies
which have demonstrated compliance with design and manufacturing
quality control standards can self-approve broad categories of
devices. Similarly, there is a conducive climate for clinical
investigation in many European countries. The bottom line is that
a product that might take 6 years to bring to market in the United
States might take 4 years in Europe. With this early introduction
in Europe, there is additionally a great competitive advantage
in other international markets. This necessarily means that, even
if a new product is eventually successful, venture capital will
be required for a longer time in this country and some foreign
markets may be entirely lost. The increased costs plus the uncertainties
of the regulatory process have resulted in a predictable decrease
in the availability of venture capital in the United States.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The more favorable regulatory climate in Western
Europe has allowed many companies to establish a positive cash
flow for new products by introducing the product in Europe before
marketing in the United States. Generally such a strategy can
be expected to save approximately two years. This implies that
American patients are often cared for with products several generations
behind those used for Europeans. This phenomenon is most apparent
in fast moving fields of medicine such as imaging and cardiology.
Recently, Medtronics, one of the largest U.S. device companies,
announced that it was transferring its entire venture group to
Europe. With an increase in clinical research in Europe along
with earlier product introductions, there will be an increased
incentive also to move manufacturing jobs<sup><a href="foot.html">17</a></sup>.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >While in the past American dominance in the
medical device industry was assured, the current outlook is far
less optimistic. Many factors had led to this dominance including
a well financed health care system, strong academic health centers,
a reasonable regulatory policy and low manufacturing costs. Of
these, our efficient manufacturing still gives us a distinct advantage.
Significant regulatory reform would go a long way to reverse the
current adverse trend.<BR>

<br>
<h3>CURRENT TRENDS IN REFORM PROPOSALS</h3>
Almost everyone in the device industry now
supports regulatory reform of one sort or another and agrees that
many areas of industry are severely constrained by excessive governmental
mandates<sup><a href="foot.html">18</a></sup>. There is widespread recognition that regulatory bodies
impose large costs in terms of increased prices and loss of desirable
employment opportunities as well as decreased opportunities for
innovation. In the medical device field, many organizations have
proposed relief from particularly burdensome regulations, often
without first seriously considering the possibility of fundamental
reform. In general, trade organizations, which primarily represent
large manufacturers, tend to shy away from fundamental reform,
while representatives of the smaller manufacturers tend to be
more willing to consider basic issues. This to be expected. Large
companies can better afford the large expensive specialized staff
needed to deal with the FDA. Furthermore, in the device industry,
small companies tend to be responsible for a disproportionate
share of significant innovation and thus are most constrained
by excessive and inappropriate regulation. Finally, burdensome
regulations may, in the short run, work to the benefit of established
firms because they make it more difficult for new, and often smaller,
manufacturers to enter the market. There are, of course, many
exceptions to these generalizations.<BR>

<P>
Current popular proposals for regulatory reform
can be conveniently divided into three categories. One group of
reform proposals is directed at ensuring that the FDA acts  expeditiously.
A second seeks to break the FDA's monopoly. Finally, there is
a host of proposals narrowly aimed at very specific regulatory
abuses.<BR>

<P>
<U>More Expeditious Review</U>
<P>
The 1976 law envisioned very rapid review of
new products. In fact it can be argued that, except for the minority
of devices in FDA Class 3, there was no <I>requirement</I> for
premarket review at all. Only notification of the intention to
market was required. In fact, over the years, there have been
attempts to obfuscate the fact that the FDA has tolerated very
long review cycles. Thus, the FDA at times has reported median
review times, effectively disregarding cases where the delays
have been very long indeed; has not counted the time taken by
manufactures to respond to sometimes inappropriate FDA questions
and requests; and, has pressured manufactures to &quot;request&quot;
that the FDA &quot;stop the clock.&quot; The delays involve much
more than new product applications and include, for example, the
entire process for appropriately reclassifying totally new products
after they have been initially placed arbitrarily in Class 3.
The problem facing reformers who attempt to address the issue
of excessive delays is what to do if, as in the past, the FDA
simply does not comply with the legally established deadlines.
One suggested approach is to not require FDA notification for
less complex devices, perhaps all of Class 1 devices and certain
designated types of Class 2 devices. Such self-certifying is very
close to analogous features in the European Union system. However,
this begs the question of responsibility for the classification
itself. In the FDA system, devices are classified in Class 1 if
&quot;general controls&quot; are sufficient to ensure safety.
Such a criterion is at best subjective and contrasts markedly
with the rather explicit and objective European system. Allowing
manufacturers to self certify Class 1 devices, without reforming
the classification system itself, might break down in practice
into endless litigation.<BR>

<P>
A second difficult issue is what to do if a
manufacturer in good faith places a device in Class 1, manufactures
and markets it and later the FDA decides that the device needs
to adhere to &quot;performance standards&quot; and thus should
have been placed in Class 2. Certainly one would not want to force
such a device off the market if there were no reason to believe
that there were an actual safety problem. Again, the fundamental
need is unambiguous up-front classification.<BR>

<P>
Finally, there have been proposals to allow
marketing of devices which have been approved by the European
Union if FDA regulatory delays exceed statutory limits. It should
be noted that many U.S. products are or will be approved for marketing
in Europe. Such a proposal is an implicit recognition of the quality
of the European system, and one might question why one should
not simply recognize European certification and allow the FDA
and the European Union to engage in jurisdictional competition.
One could also envision that a system which recognized European
approvals only after the FDA failed to act expeditiously might
well exacerbate the adversarial nature of the approval system.
<BR>

<P>
Eventual approval is not sufficient to attract
venture capital needed to develop new products if the approval
process itself is subject to capricious delays due to regulatory
uncertainty. Harmonization of American and European standards,
so that there is an objective basis for mutual recognition, is
a far better answer<sup><a href="foot.html">19</a></sup>.<BR>

<P>
<U>The FDA Monopoly</U>
<P>
A number of current proposals seek to break
the FDA monopoly by privatizing some FDA functions. The inspiration
is clearly from the European Union system where <I>competing</I>
private &quot;notified bodies&quot; certify that the manufacturer
has met the explicit requirements which justify the manufacturer
applying a CE mark (of approval) to it products. Unfortunately,
many current proposals fail to recognize that the virtue of the
European system lies in the fact that the European notified bodies
are expected to exercise independent judgement and are not merely
arms of the central governmental authority. Furthermore, to the
extent possible, their evaluations and decisions are based on
detailed published international standards. Contracting out current
FDA functions to private bodies without first rationalizing these
functions simply substitutes different organizations and different
workers. While there may be some virtue using an organization
that works more efficiently than many governmental agencies, the
more basic problem is with the process itself. Those proposals
which do not foster competition between private certifying bodies
by allowing manufacturers to choose the organization from which
to purchase certifying services would appear to offer limited
advantages.<BR>

<P>
<U>Specific Regulatory Abuses</U>
<P>
Finally, there is a whole series of miscellaneous
proposals that address specific abuses and problem areas. Some
seek to streamline programs that just do not work. This includes
the simplification of the device malfunction (vigilance) program
and the device tracking program. Others seek to eliminate programs
for which there is no logical rationale. This would include the
freeing of exports to first world countries which are perfectly
able to police their own markets. Others attack very narrow issues
which, for lack of a better term, can be classified as corrections
of abuse of power and dereliction of duty. These include attempts
to improve accountability by specifying which particular officials
can make certain decisions, mandating periodic meetings at the
manufacturer's request, requiring unequivocal classification of
a product as either a drug or a device, prohibiting the FDA from
making decisions based on cost-effectiveness, limiting the authority
of the FDA to require controlled clinical studies, prohibiting
the withholding of a classification decision based on GMP violations
and many other such important but narrow issues. While it might
be desirable to achieve immediate relief by instituting some of
these reforms, they represent an attempt to micromanage the FDA.
Without fundamental reform, they, like most well meaning efforts
at micromanagement, run the risk of exchanging of one set of problems
for another. In general, the reform effort would be better spent

<h3>THE EU SYSTEM APPROVAL OF NEW MEDICAL
DEVICES</h3>
Much can be learned from the ongoing European
Union medical device regulatory reforms. Approval of new medical
devices in the EU is characterized by:<BR>
</FONT>

<P>
The European Union medical device regulation
law is based on a list of &quot;Essential Requirements<sup><a href="foot.html">20</a></sup>.&quot;
These are universal requirements that apply to all devices. They
cover areas such as safe design and construction, clinical efficacy,
disclosure of residual risks, protective packaging, infection
control, compatibility with other devices, calibration and stability,
radiation protection, electrical safety, labeling, and instruction
manuals. In principle it is sufficient for the manufacturer to
rely solely on these requirements to justify putting a device
on the market. However, manufactures usually rely on published,
internationally agreed upon, standards which are specific to individual
devices or processes. For many decades, professional organizations
such as AAMI and IEEE in the United States and international standards
organizations such as ISO have brought together groups of experts
from the manufacturer, user and government sectors to develop
written standards covering a wide variety of topics. These include
very technical narrowly defined standards to ensure mechanical
compatibility, such as standards for machine screw threads; performance
standards for various materials, such as those for biocompatibility;
safety standards for the internal monitoring of life support equipment;
limits on electromagnetic radiation; as well as very broad standards
defining quality assurance for production, testing and even the
design process<sup><a href="foot.html">21</a></sup>. In the European system, such standards, originating
in various sources, are ultimately accepted by the EU's central
standards organization. While a manufacturer may choose to devise
alternate methods, adherence to such standards by the manufacturer
is presumptive evidence that the manufacturer has met the Essential
Requirements. Clearly defined standards provide objective criteria
and remove much of the uncertainty and risk in seeking approval.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Using published objective criteria related
to complexity and risk, all devices are placed in one of four
classes (I, IIa, IIb, III) by the manufacturer<sup><a href="foot.html">22</a></sup>. </FONT>

Examples are shown in Table 1.</FONT>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 >*active implantable devices are technically
regulated under a separate EU </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2 >regulation but from a practical standpoint
are handled like Class III devices<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
For the large number of devices in Class I,
the manufacturer self-certifies compliance with the Essential
Requirements by preparing a prescribed Declaration of Conformity,
a technical document containing the supporting data which is available
to the authorities. Certain special processes, such as sterilization
needed for a Class I device, may require additional certification
by a notified body,<I> vide infra</I>.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<U>Notified Bodies</FONT></U>
<P>
For all other devices, the manufacturer must
engage the services of an independent &quot;test house&quot; to
audit their systems or product and certify compliance with the
Essential Requirements. These test houses, termed &quot;notified
bodies&quot; in the European system and &quot;device certification
bodies,&quot; or DCB's in our proposed reform are themselves certified
(licensed), in accordance with published standards, by governmental
authorities. In Europe, the manufacturer may engage any notified
body from any country in the European Union. In practice, many
of the notified bodies come from the long tradition of test houses
which physically test production samples. They can be thought
of as being similar to analogous firms in the United States such
as Underwriter's Laboratories. Others come from the more recent
tradition of firms that certify quality assurance systems. There
are a large number of American firms that do similar work and
certify that manufacturers of all types conform to ISO 9000 quality
assurance standards. Many of the notified bodies are licensed
in specialized areas. <I>Objectivity</I> is ensured by the heavy
reliance on published, well constructed standards for both device
classification and regulatory compliance.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
In addition to being able to choose between
compliance with published standards and devising <I>ad hoc</I>
methods of compliance with the essential requirements, manufacturers
generally have the <I>flexibility</I> to choose between two fundamentally
different methods of demonstrating compliance with the Essential
Requirements. One method involves having the notified body actually
examine or test the entire production run (or statistically valid
samples of the production run) to confirm that applicable standards
have been met. The second method involves having the notified
body certify the manufacturer's quality assurance systems. These
include systems for testing the final product, producing the product
and/or designing the product. The notified body, in many instances,
can certify that the manufacturer has sufficient quality assurance
systems in place to self-certify individual products<sup><a href="foot.html">23</a></sup>. The specific
options available to the manufacturer depend on the class of the
device. In general, the higher class devices must adhere to more
stringent regulations. Examples of allowable compliance methods
are presented in Table II.<BR>

Thus, manufacturers have the <I>flexibility</I>
to choose from a wide array of methods to comply with the device
regulations so that the process of bringing devices to the market
is facilitated. Methods may be chosen that are appropriate to
the company size, strengths and market. The result is that unnecessary
delays are avoided.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I>Timeliness</FONT></I>
of approvals is critical. One of the largest sources of complaints
concerning our current system is the time required to get through
the regulatory approval process. Although the FDA has recently
attempted to expedite the process, 510(k)s and PMA's have taken
far longer that the statutory 90 and 180 days to complete the
process. The profitability associated with bringing a new device
to the market, and thus the practicality of devoting resources
to innovation, is critically dependent on the amount of time it
takes. A delay has at least three deleterious effects. First,
more venture (or internal) capital is needed to support the product
during a prolonged development phase. Second, an income stream
needed to provide an adequate return on capital is delayed. Finally,
during the delay, competitors may become established in the market
place. The European system attacks the problem of timeliness directly
by not allowing anyone to have a monopoly on approval authority.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
A basic problem in the U.S. medical device
regulatory system is that the FDA has had a legal monopoly on
approvals and, if it takes longer than what is reasonable, the
manufacturer has no alternative options. By opening up the process
to competition and allowing the manufacturer the option of choosing
which notified body to engage, the Europeans have essentially
obviated the entire problem. In addition, for many devices, especially
when certified high level quality assurance mechanisms are in
place, the manufacturer may gain additional flexibility and save
time by being allowed to self-certify that the essential requirements
have been met. This problem with timeliness of approvals probably
has been the primary reason some of our best device companies
have shifted new product development to Europe<sup><a href="foot.html">24</a></sup>. Their goal is
to obtain expeditious approval so that they can establish an early
revenue stream so as to produce a return on their large capital
investment<sup><a href="foot.html">25</a></sup>. The Wilkerson Group<sup><a href="foot.html">26</a></sup> has complied a list of 100 devices
which are currently available in other developed nations but which
are unavailable to the American patient.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
The European system objective takes advantage
of <I>competitiveness</I> is two separate areas. First, the notified
bodies compete with each other on the basis of price, timeliness
and availability. Our DCB's will function in the same manner.
In addition, since a European manufacturer can engage a notified
body from another country (which was certified by that country's
authorities), there is also jurisdictional competition which acts
as a check on the government itself. If the United States and
the European Union were able to sufficiently harmonize their systems
so as to allow mutual recognition of device approvals, we would
be able to emulate that aspect of the European system.<BR>

<h3>A NEW REGULATORY REFORM PROPOSAL</h3>

<FONT >The FDA itself has publicized its efforts to
speed approvals and is investigating contracting out some of its
functions to non-governmental bodies. Devising a more reasonable
regulatory structure is made easier by the fact the European Union
has accomplished just that. Not only is their experience useful,
but bilateral trade would be facilitated if the system we adopt
is similar enough to theirs that device approval on both sides
of the Atlantic could be accomplished with minimal duplicative
effort and cost.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Alternative paths to reform which would simply
seek to curb the worst governmental abuses without fundamentally
changing the structure are inadequate. The basic 1976 law was
predicated on a device classification system based on performance
standards that were never developed. Approval of most new devices
was based on &quot;substantial equivalence&quot; to previously
approved devices. Not only was the meaning of &quot;substantial
equivalence&quot; never adequately defined, but the entire concept
of similarity with predicate devices must, by necessity, break
down over time as technology advances and the thread of similarity
with older devices becomes weaker. It is as if the space shuttle
was to be approved based on its substantial equivalence with an
ox cart. Finally, faced with the lack of objective criteria for
action, the FDA has become, at best, a cautious and ponderous
bureaucracy. This was predictable and no amount of cosmetic reform
will change the forces which have caused this bureaucratic evolution.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The new European Union medical device regulatory
system offers a more rational structure. The EU system has been
in full effect since 1992 for the most complex and risky medical
devices, active implantables; since the beginning of 1995 for
other medical devices; and is soon to be phased in for <I>in vitro</I>
diagnostic devices. U.S. manufactures have gained experience with
the EU system through two mechanisms. First, many U.S. companies
export to Europe and are thus fully subject to the EU system.
In response, the European notified bodies are well represented
in the United States. More fundamentally, over the years, American
professional organizations have been very active in publishing
standards which ultimately have become the international standards
that form the basis of the EU system. This includes both the thousands
of narrowly defined standards that guide details of design and
also more fundamental standards, such as the ISO 9000 series,
which form the basis of modern quality control systems. In fact
most major American medical device manufacturers either have obtained
or are in the process of obtaining ISO 9000 (series) certification.
Full ISO 9000 certification is significantly more comprehensive
than the GMP regulations currently administered by the FDA as
it includes a quality control system for the design process itself.
Full conformity with these standards, frequently reconfirmed,
allows medical device companies subject to the EU system the authority
to self-certify new products of moderate complexity. This then
allows a very rapid design-marketing cycle, so important to facilitate
the incremental nature of medical device innovation. Because of
the familiarity of American manufacturers with both the EU system
and the standards upon which it is based, it should be possible
for the United States to make a rapid transition to this more
rational and modern system of medical device approval. No doubt
there would have to be a transition period with both the old and
the new approval systems available, especially for devices already
in the approval process. In addition it would seem prudent, at
least until the new system is well established in this country
for the FDA to be notified of each DCB Class III device approval
sufficiently in advance of marketing (90 days) to allow confirmation
that the appropriate standards had been used.  Since the FDA is
a member of international standards organizations, this would
have the further advantage of providing information useful in
drafting new standards. Figures 1 and 2 compare our current approval
process and the proposed replacement approval process.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<IMG SRC="IMG00017.GIF"><IMG SRC="IMG00018.GIF"><FONT >Adapting
the EU system of device approvals essentially privatizes two important
functions of the FDA: device approvals and GMP (quality assurance)
inspections. There are other FDA functions that need to be considered.
In the EU system, the health authorities of each individual county
have five major functions. They have the responsibility and authority
to license the notified bodies. This is done in reference to internationally
agreed upon standards. Two, administer a post-marketing &quot;vigilance&quot;
system that monitors unexpected failures and adverse effects of
the products. Three, have the authority to remove products from
the market which prove to be out of conformity with the essential
requirements. Four, are responsible for controlling the safety
of human subjects in clinical investigations. Finally, they have
investigative authority and serve to keep the system honest. One
defining characteristic of the EU system is that the manufacturer,
not the government, is primarily responsible for the safety and
effectiveness of their product. The private notified body is a
check on the manufacturer and is in the tradition of a testing
laboratory. The government health authority polices the system.
Most importantly, although the manufacturer must demonstrate (to
the satisfaction of the notified body) that the device is as safe
as is practical according to the state of the art and that it
functions effectively as claimed on its labeling and in its instruction
manual, the final judgement as to relative clinical benefit and
risk is left to the practice of medicine and to those forces which
regulate it.<sup><a href="foot.html">27</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >With a few limitations, a reformed U.S. system
should follow this outline. The FDA's current vigilance system
for medical devices is so overwhelmed with data that it has been
of little use. Since manufacturers already are required to collect
and analyze data concerning device malfunctions and adverse effects,
it would seem reasonable for the manufacturer to have the opportunity
to do the preliminary analysis and pass onto the FDA only those
reports where there is a reasonable possibility that there was
a device problem<sup><a href="foot.html">28</a></sup>. The manufacturer would, of course, have to maintain
records of all reports and their analysis for inspection by their
DCB (and in the case of concern, by the FDA). The FDA, as the
recipient of data from all manufacturers could then perform the
important function of correlating adverse reports concerning the
same type of product produced by several different manufacturers.
It also would be able to monitor individual manufacturer's response
to reports concerning their own devices. In addition the FDA would
be in a position to exchange information with the European Union
authorities. This might facilitate the handling of adverse events
that are so rare that data from multiple countries are needed.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In the United States, Institutional Review
Boards, especially those in the academic health centers, have
generally functioned well to both protect the interests of patients
and subjects and to facilitate research. However, it would be
reasonable for the FDA to function as a repository of data concerning
all adverse events during clinical investigations, as such a national
clearing house with access to data from many sites might facilitate
the early detection of rare events.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >With these few modifications, a reformed American
medical device regulatory system would closely follow the EU model.
The FDA would become a smaller, better focused organization with
many of their functions assumed by organizations in the private
sector.<BR>

<h2>IV. Regulatory Reform and Liability for Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices</h2>
by W. Kip Viscusi<P>

<CENTER><B><FONT >EXECUTIVE SUMMARY<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >Tort liability for the pharmaceutical and medical
device industry has been almost synonymous with the liability
crisis.  Notwithstanding the substantial level of government regulation
in these industries, firms have been the subject of major lines
of litigation, such as those involving DES and the Dalkon Shield.
 In terms of the total number of liability cases as well as the
share of liability costs relative to industry sales, the pharmaceutical
industry has been a major focal point of the liability burden.
 These costs have been disproportionate to the overall role of
the pharmaceutical and medical device industries in the economy,
as they have suffered in large part because their products are
intrinsically involved in life and death situations.  The result
is that these liability costs have substantially discouraged new
product innovation.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The extent of this liability is also surprising
in view of the already substantial role of government intervention
affecting pharmaceuticals and medical devices.  Pharmaceutical
products must undergo an extensive FDA review both in terms of
the character of the product and the wording of the hazard warning.
 Medical devices are also subject to Federal regulation as well
as the pre-emption provisions that should presumably limit tort
liability.  At the current time, there fails to be adequate recognition
on the part of the courts of the role played by government regulation
in insuring efficient levels of safety.  In recognition of this
government activity, this paper proposes a regulatory compliance
defense for all pharmaceutical and medical device product liability,
not simply a defense against punitive damages.  This proposal
would create a more even-handed treatment of pharmaceutical products
and medical devices.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The proposals to revamp the FDA drug and device
approval process would not limit the applicability of these proposals.
 So long as an institutional mechanism insuring an efficient level
of product safety was provided to consumers, there would be no
need to second guess these administrative reviews by the courts.
 Thus, the regulatory compliance defense would simply be a recognition
that there has already been government certification and that
the company has fulfilled its requirements with respect to the
provision of products that provide an adequate level of safety.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >A different legal issue related to the proposal
is the ultimate liability of the Dug and Device Certifying Bodies
that would work in conjunction with the FDA as part of the revised
regulatory process.  Potential liability for negligence in carrying
out its obligations or for breaking contractual obligations to
manufacturers should be permitted to promote responsible operation
of these groups.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >However, it is also essential to formalize
the current recognition by the courts that such certification
bodies should not be subject to strict liability to third parties
injured by products.  Otherwise, particularly in contexts of joint
and several liability, many quite responsible institutions would
be reluctant to enter the certification market for fear that their
very existence would be threatened by tort liability suits that
might even be completely unrelated to the manner in which they
carried out their obligations.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >INTRODUCTION<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >The pharmaceutical and medical device industries
are one of the principal targets of tort liability litigation.
 Lawsuits against the firms in their industries have long been
among the most prominent liability cases.  Moreover, if we exclude
asbestos and Agent Orange, the pharmaceutical industry has been
by far the leading industry with respect to mass toxic torts.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The prominent role of the pharmaceutical industry
and medical device industries are not a reflection of corporate
irresponsibility.  Rather, the nature of the products produced
by these industries are intrinsically involved in individual health
and in the treatment of patients, many of whom will experience
adverse outcomes and even death during the course of their treatment.
 This locus of the product's use, coupled with the stringent nature
of liability standards, has led to a substantial liability burden
that many observers view as unproductive.  For example, the National
Academy of Sciences concluded that high product liability costs
were largely responsible for shutting down American research with
respect to contraceptives<sup><a href="foot.html">1</a></sup>.  These costs eliminated research not
because the research was in any sense socially undesirable, but
because firms incurred costs whenever the research led to products
linked to the hazards associated with childbirth.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The substantial tort liability burden is particularly
striking in that it has been coupled with a situation in which
the pharmaceutical industry itself is highly regulated.  The particular
products sold are subject to highly stringent regulations with
respect to their safety and efficacy.  This pre-market approval
process is much more extensive than, for example, regulations
for automobiles or other consumer products that generate considerable
risks.  Indeed, many observers have suggested that pharmaceuticals
are overregulated because of the excessive weight placed on the
potential adverse effects of these products.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The high degree of regulation of pharmaceuticals
is inconsistent with a high tort liability exposure if the objective
of tort liability is to address inadequacies in the provision
of product safety.  The purpose of this paper is to indicate how
the tort liability system should be restructured to better reflect
the obligations that pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers
have already met to through their compliance with government regulations.
 <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This paper will explore how the tort liability
system functions and the rationale for the current structure.
 There is currently only minimal recognition of a regulatory compliance
defense for prescription drugs.  In the case of medical devices,
there is a legislative pre-emption that eliminates the threat
of tort liability.  Most Federal liability reform proposals have
only suggested limited regulatory compliance defenses for prescription
drugs, particularly with respect to punitive damages.  This paper
will suggest that these defenses should in fact be much broader
and should pertain to overall liability for drugs and devices
given regulatory approval, and not simply punitive damages.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Although the current FDA regulatory program
provides the institutional reference point, the proposals suggested
here are quite general.  The principal requirements that should
accompany any regulatory compliance defense are that any revision
of the FDA drug and medical device approval process maintain the
current safety standards and continue to establish a uniform warnings
vocabulary.  Provided that these two conditions are met, the rationales
for these proposals will be quite robust with respect to different
institutional structures. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >The Importance of Pharmaceutical and Medical
Device Litigation</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT > </FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Product liability litigation against the pharmaceutical
and medical device industries has been considerable.  Notwithstanding
the rigorous regulatory review given to these products, plaintiffs
are often successful in obtaining recoveries for product-related
injuries.  Some of the biggest lines of litigation have involved
these products.  As of 1990, for example, there were 210,000 Dalkon
Shield personal injury claimants, 200,000 claimants against DES,
200,000 claimants against Bendectin, and 500 claimants involving
tampons<sup><a href="foot.html">2</a></sup>.  More recently, the breast implant litigation has led
to the establishment of a trust fund of over $4 billion to cover
potential losses.  This section will provide a brief overview
of some of the liability trends for the pharmaceutical industry<sup><a href="foot.html">3</a></sup>
and an assessment of the extent to which these litigation levels
exceed that for other industries.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >To explore these issues, this section will
focus on data for federal product liability cases developed by
the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.  This data
base makes it possible to track liability suits and awards for
cases in the Federal Courts.  Omitted from this tally will be
out of court settlements as well as cases resolved in state courts.
 This omission consequently will lead to a substantial understatement
of the overall level of product liability costs for the pharmaceutical
and medical device industry.  Moreover, to the extent that companies
are increasingly relying on out-of-court settlements to resolve
liability cost issues, as is evidenced in the establishment of
the breast implant compensation fund, there will be diminished
litigation.  This change in litigation strategies will create
a deceptive impression of the overall liability burden.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Figure 1 provides a profile of the number of
federal product liability cases for manufacturing industries<sup><a href="foot.html">4</a></sup> excluding
pharmaceuticals and for the pharmaceutical industry.  What is
striking about the case trends in Figure 1 is that the pharmaceutical
industry liability is often half or more that of the entire remaining
manufacturing sector of the economy.  In 1985 the number of pharmaceutical
industry cases in the Federal Courts was about double that of
all other manufacturing industries.  This tremendous liability
burden is dispro-portionate to the output share of pharmaceuticals.
 The remaining manufacturing sector excluding the pharmaceutical
industry had a dollar value of shipments that was much larger
than that of the pharmaceutical industry in 1989.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >To fully assess the extent of the liability
burden, one needs to know not only the number of cases filed but
also whether these cases are successful and what award was paid.
 The measure that will be used to assess the extent of pharmaceutical
industry liability will be the relative liability burden given
the scale of the industry.  In particular, Figure 2 provides a
profile of the ratio of the annual product liability awards to
the total sales both for pharmaceuticals as well as the remaining
manufacturing industry.  What is striking is that except in two
years in which the liability awards were unusually low, 1979 and
1989, the level of the relative liability burden was considerably
greater for the pharmaceutical industry than for the rest of the
manufacturing sector.  In the years of the greatest crisis in
tort liability from 1982 to 1986 the level of the liability burden
dwarfed that for the manufacturing sector.  Although the level
of liability awards in the Federal Courts declined after 1986,
even in 1987 and 1988 the relative liability burden for manufacturing
was considerably less than that for pharmaceuticals.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >When viewed in absolute terms, the extent of
the liability burden may not appear to be great.  For example,
even in the highest year of relative liability costs, 1986, the
federal product liability award percentage of sales was only 0.05
percent for pharmaceuticals.  However, the award percentage relative
to the profits of the firm is much greater.  Even more important
is that the federal product liability awards only should be used
as an index of the relative liability burden not as an indication
of the total extent of the liability costs.  Even for the Federal
suits, the out-of-pocket legal expenses and defense costs will
not be included in this tally.  An additional omission is that
cases settled out of court and all cases resolved in state courts
likewise will not be reflected in these data.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The basic message of Figures 1 and 2 is that
pharmaceutical liability has typically far outdistanced that of
other manufacturing industries, relative to its share of industrial
activity.  One hypothesis is that these products are more likely
to be defective and to cause injury than are other manufacturing
products.  However, it is noteworthy that the premarket review
and ongoing monitoring of the performance of pharmaceutical and
medical devices is much more vigorous than for any other major
product group.  The subsequent sections will explore this inconsistency
and examine the nature of the criteria applied by regulatory agencies.
 What will be particularly striking is that the same types of
criteria applied by the courts are mirrored in the regulatory
guidelines.  In effect, juries are second guessing decisions made
by the FDA on a prospective basis and are awarding substantial
verdicts to plaintiffs ex post even in instances in which the
Federal regulatory requirements were fulfilled.<BR>

<h3>The Current Regulatory Structure
and Its Implications for Tort Liability</h3>
<P>
The current role of the government with respect
to pharmaceuticals and medical devices is twofold.  First, the
government reviews these products to ensure their safety and efficacy.
 Second, the government plays an informational role in establishing
the kinds of information that can be conveyed with respect to
the characteristics of these products and the associated risks.
 The discussion below will consider the role of regulatory compliance
defense with respect to each of these aspects of government regulation.
<BR>
<P>
<b>Pre-Market Approval of Pharmaceuticals<BR>
</b>

<P>
The first phase of government regulation of
the products is a determination of which pharmaceutical products
are permitted to be marketed.  The first stage of this process
typically involves the submission of an investigational new drug
application to conduct trials for a new drug.  The legal requirements
for this application require that the company provide information
with respect to the chemistry, pharmacology, toxicology, and results
of animal and laboratory testing.<sup><a href="foot.html">5</a></sup>  These trials may then begin
provided the FDA does not either request more information or modify
the protocol submitted by the company for the proposed clinical
trials.  From a practical standpoint, the nature of the protocols
are often dictated by the FDA.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
The clinical trial process consists of three
phases.  Phase one trials are designed to elicit information about
&quot;the metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drugs in
humans, [and] the side effects associated with increasing doses.&quot;<sup><a href="foot.html">6</a></sup>
These tests are also intended to provide information pertaining
to the product's safety.  These phase one trials typically involve
tests on a small number of healthy adults- approximately 20-80
people.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
If the phase one trials are successful, the
company proceeds to undertake phase two trials, which typically
involve testing the drug on 200-300 people who have the specific
disease or condition for which the product is targeted.  The phase
two trials are &quot;conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of
the drug for a particular indication or indications in patients
with the disease or condition under study.&quot;<sup><a href="foot.html">7</a></sup>  In addition,
these trials are intended to assess whether there are adverse
side effects associated with the drug.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
If the phase two trials are also successful,
the company proceeds to the phase three clinical trials involving
1,000 - 3,000 patients who also have the specific condition or
disease for which the drug is targeted.<sup><a href="foot.html">8</a></sup>  As the phase three trials
reach conclusion, the company submits a new drug application (NDA)
to the FDA to obtain permission to sell the pharmaceutical product.
 This application must include both safety and efficacy information,
and it is a compendium of all the available data obtained thus
far regarding the performance of the drugs with respect to these
two objectives.  In addition, the NDA must include information
pertaining to the proposed labeling for the new drug.<sup><a href="foot.html">9</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
In evaluating the NDA, the FDA must ensure
that the product complies with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic
Act (FDCA) requirements pertaining to safety, and that &quot;substantial
evidence&quot; of efficacy be demonstrated.  This stage of the
drug approval process is often quite lengthy, as the FDA review
often takes years after the submission of the NDA.  In many cases
these delays arise because the FDA requests new information from
the pharmaceutical company.  Overall, the NDA process takes between
five to seven years and involves a cost that has been estimated
to be as high as $231 million for each NDA.<sup><a href="foot.html">10</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
An additional cost of the drug lag is that
patients in the United States will be deprived of drugs that potentially
could reduce mortality and morbidity.  There are thus two types
of competing errors known as Type I and Type II errors that could
arise with respect to the approval of new drugs.  The FDA might
approve drugs that turn out to have adverse consequences such
as thalidomide, which was approved in Great Britain but never
approved for use in the United States.  On the other hand, the
FDA could fail to approve drugs that are beneficial and would
have reduced risks because of excessively stringent safety standards.
 Many academic critics of the FDA have charged that the FDA has
erred too greatly on the side of preventing errors of commission
rather than being concerned with the risks that would be averted
by the new drugs that it fails to approve.<sup><a href="foot.html">11</a></sup>  The AIDS lobbyists
have called particular attention to the effect of these substantial
delays as well as the imbalance in attention that the FDA places
on errors of commission as opposed to errors of omission.  This
special disease interest lobbying group has succeeded in expediting
the review process for AIDS-related drugs.  Other potential beneficiaries
of drugs that are delayed by the lengthy review process are not
as well organized and are not as effective in bringing political
pressure to bear to make the FDA more responsive to the patients
who could benefit from these new products.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
The primary implication of this stringent drug
approval process for the regulatory compliance defense is that
the current concern with the potential safety of new drugs is
already quite substantial.  Indeed, from an economic efficiency
standpoint, one might well argue that the FDA places excessive
reliance on safety, particularly on the safety aspects pertaining
to adverse effects that might be created by drugs.  All that is
needed for purposes of the subsequent discussion of the regulatory
compliance defense is the general result that the FDA procedures
or privately operated procedures will ensure adequate levels of
safety.  These tests will fulfill a company's obligation to provide
an efficient level of safety associated with its products. <BR>
<P>
<b>Regulation of Drug Labeling<BR>
</b>

<P>
Prescription drugs by their very nature pose
potential risks either from misuse or adverse reactions, which
leads to the prescription requirement.  Medical devices also pose
potential risks of a similar nature.  As a result, the FDA requires
that information pertaining to the associated risks be provided
with these products.  In the case of pharmaceutical products,
the warning label must communicate both the overall risk associated
with the product as well as any specific risks associated with
particular groups of product users.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Under the regulatory system established by
the FDCA, the FDA is largely responsible for writing the complete
content of the package inserts<sup><a href="foot.html">12</a></sup> that accompany pharmaceutical products.
 One former FDA General Counsel observed that the &quot;FDA ...
retains, as a practical matter, complete control over package
inserts.&quot;  Unlike the warnings practices under the OSHA hazard
communications standard or EPA labeling requirements for pesticides,
the FDA has both substantial control of the content of the warnings
as well as the warning structure.  In particular, the FDA has
in place a standardized warnings vocabulary that is used to communicate
the risks associated with the drugs.  This vocabulary stipulates
which kinds of information are presented in different places on
the label as well as how different variations in the label, such
as boxing of warnings or larger print, should be used to highlight
specific warnings.  Because of the standardized warnings approach
and the fact that physicians receive training in the processing
of such warning information in pharmacology courses, this system
provides an efficient means of communicating risk information
to the learned intermediary involved in prescribing pharmaceutical
products.  The fact that it is not the patient, but rather the
physician (learned intermediary) who is the target audience for
the warnings greatly affects the character and content of the
warnings message.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
The FDA does not develop the warnings language
in isolation.  Rather, the manufacturer is required to submit
to the FDA information pertaining to both the safety and the efficacy
of the product as part of its NDA.  In addition, the manufacturer
must submit proposed labeling for the drug for the FDA review.<sup><a href="foot.html">13</a></sup>
 In conjunction with the manufacturer, the FDA develops the initial
label for the drug.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
There is often a bargaining process between
the FDA and the manufacturer over the content of the warning label.
 The FDA has the ultimate authority since approval of the labeling
is a necessary part of the NDA approval process.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
The structure of the warnings vocabulary developed
by the FDA consists of the following sections.  The first section
of the warning label provides information that describes the general
characteristics of the product.<sup><a href="foot.html">14</a></sup>  The second section of the warning
label consists of information pertaining to the clinical pharmacology
of the product, whereby the warning provides information pertaining
to how the particular product operates.  The third section of
the label provides information pertaining to the indications and
the usage of the drug, and this is followed by a contraindications
section indicating the situations under which the drug should
not be administered because of the particular risks that may be
involved.  This section is followed by a warnings section that
details the risks that arise both generally as well as in specific
situations with respect to the drug.  Less frequently occurring
risks are the subject of the precautions section.  Isolated and
more random reactions to the drug are the subject of the adverse
reactions section.  Following this series of risk information
sections, the warning concludes with information about the appropriate
dosage and administration of the product.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
The standardized structure of this warnings
vocabulary greatly facilitates the ability of the physician to
process the warnings information.  The FDA also ensures a uniformity
in the use of the warnings language and a correspondence between
the language and the severity of the particular outcomes being
characterized.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
This kind of standardization could be generalized
to contexts in which the FDA did not have the authority to control
and review warnings but instead established as a reference point
a warnings vocabulary framework.  Thus, companies could provide
information with respect to a drug following these guidelines
for the positioning of information and guidelines with respect
to the usage of labeling variations such as boxing of particular
warning sections.  Liability for the company could then be based
on whether the company adhered to the particular warnings vocabulary
guidelines given the characteristics of the product.  Thus, in
our subsequent discussion of the regulatory compliance defense,
no distinction will be made between a warnings policy mandated
by the FDA or a warnings policy based on guidelines established
by the FDA.  It must, however, by recognized that there may be
an additional liability exposure if the FDA does not operate and
specifically approve the warning since then the company must show
that this warning did in fact adhere to the regulatory guidelines.
<BR>
<P>
<b>Post-Marketing Information<BR>
</b>

<P>
After a drug is made available for sale, there
may be adverse consequences that are observed that were not apparent
during the testing process.  If these problems are particularly
severe, it may be appropriate to withdraw the drug from the market.
 Thus, the safety of the drug should be a continuing concern.
 Similarly, if there are adverse consequences associated with
the drug that were not included in the initial labeling, the hazard
information provided should be amended over time to reflect this
changing informational state.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
In each case the appropriate reference point
for whether a firm has met its obligation should be the state
of the information at that particular time.  Moreover, because
adverse reactions and effects of drugs are often the subject of
speculation involving small samples, there must be some test of
the scientific validity of the adverse information before companies
should be held responsible for incorporating it in the drug evaluation
process.  A patient administered a drug for a particular ailment
may experience some adverse health effect.  However, in the absence
of a controlled experiment, it is not possible to ascertain whether
this effect is a consequence of the drug or a random variation
in health status that would have occurred if the drug had not
been administered.  The medical literature is replete with possible
adverse effects of this kind.  Some of these are subsequently
bolstered by scientific data, and others prove to be aberrations
that are never established in the literature.  In retrospect,
it is often possible to point to instances in which there was
initial fragmentary evidence regarding an adverse effect that
is ultimately established, but what is important is whether the
information available at any particular point in time is sufficient
to provide a reason for concern.  Effects that appear clearcut
in hindsight may not be evident given the state of information
at an earlier time.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
In that regard, the FDCA requires that the
pharmaceutical companies share with the FDA information pertaining
to the post-marketing performance of the drug.  This surveillance
process requires that the company report adverse experiences associated
with the drug as well as epidemiologic studies.  The current requirements
are that a company must report any serious reactions to a drug
to the FDA within 15 working days of the receipt of the information.<sup><a href="foot.html">15</a></sup>
 The sources of information that the manufacturer must examine
for these post-marketing studies include clinical, epidemiological,
or surveillance studies, as well as information that appears in
the medical literature.  The FDA then uses that information to
assess whether the drug should continue to be marketed or whether
there should be some change in the labeling for it.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
These provisions ensure the safety of drugs
and the appropriateness of information provision.  Regulation
is consequently an ongoing process that continues to reflect the
evolving state of information with respect to the drug.  Under
the current procedures, the FDA must approve any post-marketing
changes associated with the labeling of the drug, although a company
is free to withdraw a drug from the market should it choose to
do so.<sup><a href="foot.html">16</a></sup>  However, if the company does take such unilateral action,
it must simultaneously seek FDA approval for it, and if the FDA
does not approve the change it can institute a regulatory action
against the company.  Moreover, the FDA can overrule the company's
decision to change the warning label if it believes that such
a change would be inappropriate.  <BR>

<br>
<h3>The Role of Tort Law</h3>
<P>
<FONT >By imposing costs on the tortfeasor, the liability
system generates both incentives for efficient risk avoidance
as well as compensation for accident victims.  In the case of
monetary losses, both strict liability and negligence standards
will lead to an efficient level of precautions and will lead to
an optimal level of compensation for the accident victim.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Matters become somewhat different in the case
of health effects.  It is very difficult to compensate an individual
for an extreme loss of health status, such as one's life, since
finite amounts of compensation may not make one whole.  The amount
of compensation that would be needed to generate efficient incentives
would be quite large.  An efficient level of damages from a deterrence
standpoint would provide adequate financial incentive to lead
the manufacture to sell products that had an optimal level of
safety when valued using the preferences for safety of the consumer.
 How, for example, do the values of greater safety compare with
the higher cost levels of safer products?  For example, evidence
on the implicit value of life that is appropriate from the standpoint
of deterring risks is $5 million per life.  However, this amount
is not an appropriate guide for insurance and compensation.  Few
individuals would choose to purchase an insurance policy that
would make a payoff of this size in the event of their death.
 As a result, compensation amounts of this magnitude would provide
efficient incentives for deterrence but would provide excessive
insurance.  Consequently, one could view the current tort system
as somewhat split in that the amount of compensation is more closely
linked to the optimal insurance amount, such as the present value
of lost earnings, medical costs, and some compensation for pain
and suffering.  In contrast, the criteria for liability are linked
to generating efficient standards for safety.  Thus, the firm's
obligation is to provide an adequate level of safety for the good,
where this level of adequacy is what would prevail if a good were
traded in a fully functioning and efficient market.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The responsibilities of tort liability to provide
incentives for safety and compensation to accident victims depend
of course on the other societal institutions in place.  If, for
example, an individual at risk were compensated through the workers'
compensation system, there would be less need for compensation
through the tort liability system.  Similarly, if the risk level
and the adequacy of warnings is handled through a regulatory structure
that ensures an efficient level of precautions, then there is
no rationale from the standpoint of adequate deterrence for having
tort liability.  Thus, to the extent that the FDA regulations
achieve the social objective of efficient levels of control of
risk, then there is no need to duplicate this function through
additional tort liability.  The obvious exception is that in which
the company withholds critical information from the regulatory
agency so that the regulation cannot be set in an ideal manner.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Government regulations can of course be set
either too leniently or too stringently.  The fact that there
is a government regulation does not necessarily imply that there
is no role for any supplementary social institution, such as tort
liability.  However, in the case of the FDA, the general consensus
is that these regulations are certainly adequate in ensuring safety
and, to the extent that there is any divergence from optimality,
it is that the regulations are excessively stringent with respect
to the promotion of product safety.  If there is already over-deterrence,
there is consequently no rationale for bolstering of the level
of deterrence additionally through incentives provided through
tort liability.  This consideration pertains to the deterrence
or incentive role of tort liability, not necessarily to the compensation
function since regulations do not provide for the compensation
of accident victims.  However, at least from the standpoint of
safety incentives, the optimal use of regulations is to target
them in areas where there are clearly inadequate safety incentives
provided.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >There is a widespread consensus in the literature
that the current FDA drug approval process establishes safety
incentives that are excessive.<sup><a href="foot.html">17</a></sup>  The stringency of the process
and the meticulous review of new pharmaceutical drugs is reflected
in the substantial delays that U.S. consumers have experienced
with respect to the introduction of new pharmaceutical products.
 These delays are much greater than in other countries, such as
those in Europe, which also have regulatory procedures to ensure
drug safety.  Studies have also shown that because of these delays
Americans have been prevented from having access to new drugs
with beneficial effects, as the agency places a greater weight
on errors of commission rather than errors of omission.  This
imbalance in the emphasis for these two types of errors has led
to excessive deterrence of new risks that may be created by pharmaceutical
products and inadequate weight on reducing existing risks that
patients now experience.  Because these incentives already ensure
a degree of caution and safety with respect to introducing new
pharmaceutical products that is already excessive, one would not
want to further deter companies from introducing beneficial new
products through additional tort liability sanctions.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >One possible counterargument is that after
the drug is approved it may turn out to have adverse effects that
were not anticipated.  However, the task regarding the safety
and efficacy of the product is to make the best judgement that
is possible at the time the product is marketed.  If new information
becomes available to indicate that the product is riskier than
was initially believed, then the company should be held responsible
for acting upon this new information in a reasonable manner and
developing new labeling if necessary.  This way of dealing with
new information is the approach taken in Europe with respect to
medical devices in which companies have a &quot;development-risk&quot;
defense.  Companies are free of liability in the tort liability
regime in all EU countries other than Luxembourg if they can show
that the &quot;state of scientific and technical knowledge at
the time when he put the product into circulation was not such
as to enable the existence of the defect to be discovered.&quot;
 This state of the information defense coupled with a requirement
that companies meet the regulatory standards would ensure than
an efficient degree of product safety be provided both at the
time of the product's introduction as well as throughout the product's
life.  Once this has been assured, there is no additional rationale
for augmenting these safety incentives, at least from the standpoint
of risk prevention.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Off-label uses and their relation to a regulatory
compliance defense is an important issue.  The restrictions that
are pertinent for advertising drugs for off-label usage are now
quite stringent<sup><a href="foot.html">18</a></sup>.  For example, in the case of investigational
new drugs that are currently undergoing clinical study, it is
not possible to promote the drug for the usage that is currently
under scrutiny.  Notwithstanding these restrictions on the promotion
of pharmaceutical products, it is generally believed that off-label
usage are quite prevalent, particularly in the cases of AIDS and
cancer treatments.  Much of pediatric age group drug use is also
off-label.  One survey suggested that nearly one-third of the
prescriptions of oncologists for cancer patients were for off-label
usage.  In addition, an estimated 56 percent of cancer patients
have received at least one drug under an off-label purpose.

<FONT >The degree to which there is insurance reimbursement
for off-label usages depends in large part on the nature of the
experimental treatment and the existence of medical evidence supporting
its reliability.  Many off-label treatments for cancer, for example,
are not reimbursed.  Approximately one-half of 681 oncologists
surveyed by the U.S. General Accounting Office reported that at
some point they had been denied reimbursement for the costs of
an off-label prescription<sup><a href="foot.html">19</a></sup>.  That same U.S. General Accounting
Office survey also found that one-third of all the prescriptions
involving cancer chemotherapy involved off-label uses.  Among
the most controversial reimbursements for off-label usage has
been the insurance coverage for the high dose chemotherapy-autologous
bone marrow transplants, which is an expensive and risky treatment.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Strict adherents to regulatory criteria might
speculate that all off-label uses are inappropriate and should
not be undertaken since they have not been accorded FDA approval.
 However, in many instances the opposite conclusion has been reached.<sup><a href="foot.html">20</a></sup>
 The courts have ruled, for example, that Medicaid coverage could
not exclude AZT therapy for an off-label purpose for some classes
of AIDS patients.  Similarly, the courts have ruled that Blue
Cross-Blue Shield must reimburse high dose chemotherapy-autologous
bone marrow transplants.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >As Christopher (1993) notes, the nature of
the New York legal provisions with respect to off-label usage
is quite complex: &quot;New York forbids insurers from excluding
coverage of off-label uses of cancer drugs if: (1) prescription
drugs are otherwise covered in the policy; (2) the drug is FDA-approved
for some form of cancer; and (3) the off-label use in question
is recognized by one of the three compendia or recommended by
review article or editorial comment in a major peer-reviewed journal.&quot;
 However, he goes on to note that: &quot;The New York law, however,
allows insurers to exclude from coverage off-label uses expressly
contraindicated by FDA-approved labelling and experimental or</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >investigational drugs.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The nature of the regulatory compliance defense
is somewhat complicated by the use of drugs for off-label purposes.
 The regulatory criteria and the assurance that the drug has met
efficient standards for safety only pertains to uses for which
the drug has been specifically approved, or those uses specified
on the label.  In the case of off-label uses, there has not been
the same kind of review and approval that would provide an ex
ante guarantee that the firm has met its obligations with respect
to safety and efficacy for these uses.  As a result, in the case
of the off-label uses the regulatory compliance defense that is
advocated here would not be pertinent.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The practical consequences of this distinction
for off-label uses may be substantial.  It has been estimated
that about half of all drugs prescribed by doctors are given for
off-label uses because the drug is believed to be effective for
these off-label purposes.  At a fairly pedestrian level, one has
doctors prescribing Retin-A for middle aged patients who wish
to eliminate wrinkles even though this is not an on-label purpose
of this anti-acne drug.  Perhaps more importantly in terms of
individual welfare is that many cancer treatments involve off-label
uses of drugs.  At present there are no requirements that physicians
disclose to patients that the particular therapy being prescribed
is an off-label usage.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Whereas there is currently no regulatory compliance
defense in the case of pharmaceuticals, in the case of medical
devices, the 1976 Medical Devices Amendments pre-empted liability
claims against medical devices.  Pre-emption is stronger than
a regulatory compliance defense in that it forecloses all product
liability suits.  The 1995 case of <U>Michael v. Shiley, Inc.</U>
found that these Amendments pre-empted all liability actions involving
negligence, strict liability, and breech of warranty for medical
devices.<sup><a href="foot.html">21</a></sup>  This pre-emption includes all medical devices, not simply
the class III medical devices that are subject to the formal FDA
pre-market approval process.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The main exception to such broad interpretations
of the regulatory compliance defense was the recent decision by
the Ninth Circuit in <U>Kennedy v. Collagen Corp</U><sup><a href="foot.html">22</a></sup>.  In this
case, the court upheld pre-emption only when the FDA had enacted
&quot;specific counterpart requirements&quot; applicable to the
device.  Since the court viewed the pre-market approval process
for Class III devices as not constituting a Federal &quot;requirement,&quot;
the scope of the pre-emption would be severely restricted<sup><a href="foot.html">23</a></sup>.  To
date, this decision remains the exception, as other courts have
interpreted the exemption provisions quite broadly.<BR>
</FONT>
<P><b>Punitive Damages<BR>
</b>

<P>
<FONT >The role of the regulatory compliance defense
has been most prominent with respect to punitive damages rather
than with respect to the overall liability of pharmaceutical and
medical device firms.  Although it will be suggested below that
regulatory compliance should be a defense with respect to all
tort liability, it is even more compelling that punitive damages
are not warranted if a firm has fulfilled all of its regulatory
obligations and has not withheld information from the regulatory
agency.  Groups such as the American Law Institute (1991) have
indicated that abolition of punitive damages in such instances
of regulatory compliance is a particularly desirable reform.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >To see why punitive damages reforms head the
list of necessary changes in tort law, let us examine the circumstances
under which punitive damages above and beyond compensatory damages
are awarded and why these damages are not pertinent when pharmaceutical
and medical device companies have complied with government regulations.
 One rationale for punitive damages may be that compensatory damages
alone do not provide adequate deterrence when life and health
are at risk.  This argument is certainly correct from an economic
standpoint, but the role of optimal deterrence will have already
been addressed through regulatory compliance.  If a firm has already
met regulatory standards that ensure a level of safety that is
either efficient or is a more stringent safety level than dictated
by economic efficiency concerns, then there is no additional economic
rationale for punitive damages to augment the safety requirements.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >A second rationale for punitive damages is
that they would be warranted if the company's safety efforts fell
well below what was required to provide an efficient level of
safety with respect to the product.  If a firm has not met the
requirements stipulated by the regulation, then certainly punitive
damages may be warranted.  However, if all the regulatory stipulations
with respect to testing and information provision have been met,
then it is not possible that a company's safety efforts could
have fallen greatly below what should be expected since these
expectations are already set out through the regulatory guidelines.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This kind of regulatory compliance defense
may not be warranted with respect to every form of government
regulation.  However, the FDA regulations for pharmaceuticals
differ both in their nature and their stringency.  The distinctive
character of pharmaceutical regulations is that they are extremely
meticulous regulations that entail the premarket review of the
product, extensive testing of the product, a determination of
the safety and efficacy of the product, a provision of risk information
through a procedure that conforms with a highly structured warnings
vocabulary, and post-market surveillance.  These stipulations
certainly go well beyond what might be envisioned by a jury in
any particular case. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Another possible objective of punitive damages
is compensation.  However, this objective should already have
been adequately handled by the compensatory aspect of damages.
 The standard components of tort liability are designed to address
the efficient levels of compensation needed by accident victims.
 If, for example, the courts were to routinely award punitive
damages, this practice would not even be in the interest of consumers
of these products.  Higher liability costs will raise the cost
of producing the product, which in turn will raise the product
price.  In effect, purchasers of a product will be paying for
the higher punitive damage awards through more expensive products.<sup><a href="foot.html">24</a></sup>
 Payments of this type are desirable in the case of compensatory
damages that replicate the kinds of insurance that individuals
would have purchased freely.  However, if individuals would not
have purchased insurance to provide for the kinds of compensation
associated with punitive damages, then in effect, a liability
regime that imposes excessive punitive damages will have forced
customers to buy more insurance for their accident losses than
they would have chosen to provide for themselves if they could
have designed such an insurance mechanism.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >A final objective of punitive damages might
be that of retribution.  Although additional penalties on a firm
do serve as a form of retributive punishment, one must also inquire
whose interest such punishment promotes.  If adequate deterrence
and safety incentives are already ensured, retributive punishment
is not needed.  From the standpoint of the consumers of the product,
retributive punishment will not be in their interests if the higher
product price that they must pay for the litigated products reflects
the added costs imposed by such retribution.  Although there may
be instances in which customers will be willing to pay higher
prices for products to know that damages will be assessed to punish
companies, one would expect that such willingness would be associated
with flagrant disregards of safety.  If the company in fact met
regulatory guidelines for efficient provision of safe products,
then there should be little support for retributive punishment
such as this.  If there were such support, then that presumably
would be an indication of a societal preference for even more
stringent pharmaceutical and medical device safety standards than
are now in place.  Thus, a shift in the regulatory guidelines
to promote greater safety levels in response to the preferences
of consumers could ensure that these retributive preferences were
represented without having to rely on punitive damages.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Once the efficient level of safety has been
provided, punitive damages are not innocuous.  Imposing punitive
damages will deter companies from innovating products that might
potentially be subject to punitive damages, such as contraceptives.
 Similarly, companies will have an incentive to exit the market
altogether in an effort to avoid punitive damages, as has been
the case with respect to the production of vaccines.  Deterring
innovations and promoting market exit is not desirable if these
actions are the result of sanctions that are not linked to a provision
of an efficient degree of safety but in fact are imposed on the
firm even if appropriate safety standards have been met.<BR>
</FONT>
<P><b>The Current Common Law Approach<BR>
</b>

<P>
<FONT >Although there have been many discussions of
the regulatory compliance defense for FDA-approved products with
respect to punitive damages, the position taken here will be that
there also should be a regulatory compliance with respect to liability
more generally.  To examine the rationale for this defense, we
must first examine the current status of tort liability as well
as its linkage to the pharmaceutical industry.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Most observers attribute the tort liability
revolution to the emergence of strict liability as well as subsequent
developments in tort law.  The American Law Institute's Restatement
(Second) of Torts was a pivotal document that codified the strict
liability doctrine and indicated that this doctrine would replace
negligence as the preferred theory of liability.<sup><a href="foot.html">25</a></sup>  Section 402a
imposes liability on a firm if the product is &quot;in a defective
condition, unreasonably dangerous&quot; even though &quot;all
possible care&quot; was exercised &quot;in the preparation and
sale of the product.&quot;  This standard consequently is more
stringent than the negligence standard which only required that
an efficient level of safety be provided for the firm to be free
of liability.  For example, additional company expenditures on
safety are desirable so long as the marginal safety benefits exceed
the marginal safety costs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >It is noteworthy that the original drafters
of Restatement (Second) of Torts apparently did not envision that
these criteria were to be applied to &quot;unavoidably unsafe
products,&quot; such as drugs and vaccines:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT >Unavoidably unsafe products.</FONT></I><FONT >
 There are some products which, in the present state of human
knowledge, are quite incapable of being made safe for their intended
and ordinary use.  These are especially common in the field of
drugs.  An outstanding example is the vaccine for the Pasteur
treatment of rabies, which not uncommonly leads to very serious
and damaging consequences when it is injected.  Since the disease
itself invariable leads to a dreadful death, both the marketing
and the use of the vaccine are fully justified, notwithstanding
the unavoidably high degree of risk which they involve.  Such
a product, properly prepared, and accompanied by proper directions
and warnings, is not defective, nor is it unreasonably dangerous.
 The same is true of many other drugs, vaccines, and the like,
many of which for this reason cannot legally be sold except to
physicians or under the prescription of a physician.  It is also
true in many new or experimental drugs as to which, because of
the lack of time and opportunity for sufficient medical experience,
there can be no assurance of safety ... but such experience as
there is justifies the marketing and use of the drug notwithstanding
a medically recognizable risk.  The seller of such products, again
with the qualification that they are properly prepared and marketed,
and proper warning is given, where the situation calls for it,
is not to be held to strict liability for unfortunate consequences
attending their use, merely because he has undertaken to supply
the public with an apparently useful and desirable product, attended
with a known but apparently reasonable risk.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Thus, pharmaceutical products were to be exempted
from these criteria. Not-withstanding this distinction, the judicial
interpretations eventually broadened the &quot;unreasonably dangerous&quot;
test and began to focus on what constituted &quot;defectiveness.&quot;
 In <U>Barker v. Lull Engineering Company</U><sup><a href="foot.html">26</a></sup>, the court ruled
[a] product is defective in design either (1) if the product has
failed to preform as safely as an ordinary consumer would expect
when used in an intended or reasonably foreseeable manner or (2)
if, in the light of development factors discussed below, the benefits
of the challenged design do not outweigh the risk of danger inherent
in such design.  In subsequent years, both risk-utility tests
and consumer expectation tests proliferated, and it is the general
consensus that the risk-utility test is more appropriate. <sup><a href="foot.html">27</a></sup> The
manufacturer should not be liable for what the consumer might
expect since these expectations need in no way be reasonable,
but a risk-utility test that has a parallel with an economic benefit-cost
test certainly is pertinent.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The most prevalently used risk-utility test
is that developed by Dean Wade.<sup><a href="foot.html">28</a></sup>  That test consists of a variety
of factors that would affect the desirability of the product,
where all but one of these factors is subsumed into a conventional
benefit-cost test.  The one distinctive factor is that the producer
serves in an insurance role for accident victims through the tort
liability awards for product injuries.  It is this insurance role
that underlies the development of strict liability more generally.
 The general notion is that firms provide insurance for consumers
of products through tort liability, where these insurance costs
are transmitted to consumers through higher product prices.  This
theory is sound in the case of rare event product accidents such
as that associated with isolated manufacturing defects, but this
analogy breaks down in the case of mass toxic torts.  The costs
imposed by large scale litigation such as the Dalkon Shield case
cannot be shifted to consumers.  Moreover, it is not feasible
for the company to bear such large scale costs.  The result has
been that many firms have exited the market with respect to development
of new contraceptives and production of vaccines because of the
large scale of these costs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Pharmaceutical companies have not escaped the
impact of strict liability.  Several jurisdictions have found
that as a matter of law pharmaceutical products are not unavoidably
unsafe.<sup><a href="foot.html">29</a></sup>  More importantly, the courts have not ruled that compliance
with the FDCA provides a defense in the case of product liability
actions.  Pharmaceutical companies have also been found liable
with respect to the development of new liability doctrines with
respect to hazard warnings even though these warnings are specifically
approved by the FDA and developed in accordance with a highly
structured warnings vocabulary specified by the FDA.  At the present
time, the majority of all courts do not recognize the FDA regulatory
compliance defense with respect to overall liability of the firm.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The effects in the absence of regulatory compliance
defense have been quite striking.  Producers of the DPT vaccine,
for example, were exposed to substantial liability that led to
considerable caution throughout the vaccine market.  Since 1968,
the number of vaccine manufacturers in the United States has dropped
by more than 50 percent.  The American vaccine market is now controlled
by single producer monopolies in the case of vaccines for polio,
rubella, measles, mumps, and rabies.  There are similar kinds
of monopolies for many pediatric vaccines as well.  The substantial
costs of tort liability consequently have led to the exit of the
market of substantial markets concentration for vaccines.  The
result has been a considerable rise in the price of vaccines,
well in excess of the inflation rate.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >There have been, of course, changes in the
vaccine areas that have been prompted by the effects of the liability
burden.  In particular, Congress passed the Childhood Vaccine
Injury Act of 1986 in order to replace the burdensome tort litigation
process with an administrative compensation system.  Even in the
case of vaccines, this legislation has not completely eliminated
the tort liability problems.  Many vaccines, such as the chicken
pox vaccine, are not covered by the provisions of the act.  In
addition, this administrative compensation system, which is financed
by a tax on the pharmaceutical companies, requires that claimants
file claims through this program, but the claimant is free to
reject this award and can pursue a tort action under state law
if the claimant views the award as unsatisfactory.  An additional
deterrent to competition in the vaccine industry is that once
firms exited the market for vaccines, it was difficult to reenter.
 Thus, this major liability reform in the vaccine area should
be viewed as an incomplete remedy for the liability problems that
existed.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >To the extent that there has been any exemption
it has been with respect to punitive damages.  Thus far, there
are five states - Arizona, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, and Utah
- that have provided for an FDA regulatory compliance defense
against punitive damages.  There has been no punitive damage defense
adopted through Federal legislation, although such a defense is
frequently included in draft bills.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Medical devices are regulated under the 1976
Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.  Companies
are permitted to market class I medical devices, such as tongue
depressors without government approval.  Class II medical devices,
such as hearing aids, were formerly required to meet government
approved performance standards, and class III medical devices,
such as heart valves, still must undergo a process similar to
that for pharmaceuticals.  In particular, there is a pre-market
approval process for such devices.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The liability regime for pharmaceuticals is
in striking context to medical devices.  The Medical Devices Amendments
of 1976, which were amendments to FDCA, grant a pre-emption defense
for medical devices that is similar in spirit but stronger than
a regulatory compliance defense.  Indeed, in the recent 1995 case
of Michael D. Shiley, Inc., the court ruled that the medical devices
amendments of 1976 pre-empt actions involving negligence, strict
liability, and breach of implied warranty for medical devices.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In the case of medical devices, there is not
only pre-emption of cases under Federal law but also claims under
state law as well.  In particular, in 1995 the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the First Circuit ruled that the Medical Device Amendments
to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act pre-empted all state tort
claims.  Moreover, this pre-emption was held to be true even if
the manufacturer defrauded the Food and Drug Administration and
did not in fact achieve regulatory compliance.<sup><a href="foot.html">30</a></sup>  The defrauding
company was, however, subject to criminal fines for conspiracy
to defraud the FDA and was required to pay total fines of $61
million.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >What is striking about this regulatory compliance
defense, in contrast with the treatment of pharmaceuticals, is
that only class three medical devices (devices that are implanted
under the skin) are subject to premanufacturing review.  The more
minor class I and II devices are not subject to premanufacturing
review, although they are subject to postmarketing surveillance
by the FDA.  The irony of this distinction is that in contrast
with exhaustive pre-marketing review of pharmaceuticals, which
often takes up to a decade, the device approval process has been
estimated to take an average of one year.<sup><a href="foot.html">31</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This discrepancy has even led to an important
anomaly in terms of product treatment.  The Copper-7 intrauterine
device was in fact a medical device, not a pharmaceutical.  However,
before the passage of the medical device amendments of 1968, there
needed to be some means of classifying this product, and FDA chose
to classify it as a pharmaceutical.  If this product had in fact
been regulated under the subsequently promulgated Medical Device
Amendments of 1976, the firm would have been free of its ultimately
substantial liability.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The overall policy proposal of this report
is to make the regulatory compliance defense more symmetric for
both pharmaceutical products and medical devices.  Although a
regulatory compliance defense for pharmaceutical products will
not be as strong as the pre-emption given to medical devices,
it will create more similar legal framework.  The premanufacturing
review process for pharmaceuticals is much more stringent than
for medical devices.  The criteria involved ensure the safety
and efficacy of the product based on the best available state
of the information at the time.  There is no rationale for continuing
the distinction that puts pharmaceutical products at such a substantial
relative disadvantage.<BR>

<h3>Legal Implication of a Revised Approval Process</h3><BR>

<P>
<FONT >We have outlined sweeping proposals for the
revision of the pharmaceutical and medical device approvals.<sup><a href="foot.html">32</a></sup> 
The essential elements of this proposal would be to privatize
the review process for new drugs and pharmaceuticals and to foster
competition in this review process.  In the case of pharmaceuticals,
the Drug Certifying Bodies would approve the IND for the drug,
oversee the clinical development, review the NDA, and certify
that the product is safe and effective.  After this review process
was completed, the FDA would have responsibility for the final
sign off in a highly structured review process.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Delegating these responsibilities to private
entities does not necessarily create any legal problems.  Government
agencies, including the FDA, frequently draw on the expertise
and input of private parties in a variety of regulatory areas.
 What is essential, however, is that this delegation of responsibility
be handled in a sound manner to avoid any constitutional problem
that might arise in the delegation of legislative power.<sup><a href="foot.html">33</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In the case of medical devices, the manufacturing
and/or Device Certifying Body would be responsible for compliance
with established standards-based criteria.  In the case of the
highest risk devices, the FDA would do a review and confirm that
proper standards had been used.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In each case, there would be no compromise
in the safety and efficacy levels of products as compared to the
current regime.  The ultimate sign-off for these products would
also be the responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration
as would the overall character of the safety criteria.  The same
kinds of regulatory compliance defenses that would be sound proposals
under the current product liability and regulatory regime would
also be pertinent if the plan's proposals were adopted.  Thus,
if companies were in compliance with the government regulation
as administered under this new process, then the level of safety
provided by the company would be efficient, thus meeting the safety
objectives of either a negligence or strict liability standard.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Under the revised plan review process, the
Device Certifying Bodies and Drug Certifying Bodies would have
a critical role in the review process.  What, however, would be
the ultimate liability of these certifying bodies?  In the absence
of specific legal exemptions, these bodies potentially could be
subject to the usual liability criteria notably negligence and
strict liability.  If, however, thh2>IV. Regulatory Reform and Lia
liability then there would be a substantial deterrent for any
firm to enter the market as a DCB.  Such companies would face
the prospect of being named as a defendant in any potential product
liability litigation involving a drug or medical device for which
they had been involved in the approval process.  Particularly
in a world of joint and several liability in which a DCB could
be potentially responsible for the entire liability burden if
the defendant company was unable to meet the cost involved in
the award, the DCBs would risk bankruptcy in much the same way
do many companies which face the prospect of mass toxic tort litigation
or punitive damages.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In this instance, a reasonable proposal for
structuring the liability system would be to draw distinction
between potential liability with respect to negligence and strict
liability.  One would want to maintain incentives for the DCB
to exercise care in the approval of new drugs.  Thus, we would
not want the DCB to be negligent in overseeing the review process
for drugs or medical devices.  Thus, permitting suits against
the DCB by an injured plaintiff on the basis of negligence would
provide for the possibility of court sanctions against irresponsible
DCB behavior.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This liability exposure could be coupled with
the provision of a legal exemption from strict liability.  Although
the experience of Underwriters' Laboratory and other certifying
bodies suggests that strict liability has not been of consequence
to date, a specific legal exemption from strict liability could
be beneficial in eliminating the small risk of catastrophic losses
that might otherwise deter entry of potential DCBs.  Would, for
example, a university hospital be willing to gamble its entire
financial resources on the opportunity to enter this novel and
potentially highly litigious area?  If it did so, the fees needed
to cover potential liability costs would provide a deterrent to
the testing of potentially beneficial new drugs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The underlying rationale for strict liability
in the usual judicial context is that the company has a role beyond
not being negligent.  Rather, the firm should serve as the insurer
for the potential losses of accident victims and spread these
losses in much the same way as would an insurance company.  The
reasoning behind this is that the firm can pass along the cost
of the insurance to the customers who in effect will buy the insurance
for liability costs for pharmaceuticals or drugs as part of the
purchase price.  However, the additional insurance rationale is
not pertinent to whether the firm exercises appropriate care.
 The negligence doctrine alone is adequate to establishing these
incentives.  Moreover, it is not the DCB but rather the pharmaceutical
and medical device company that is marketing the product and has
the ability to spread the cost through the product price.  It
is, of course, true that the DCB can raise its fees to the companies,
which in turn can raise the product price.  Even in this instance,
however, this insurance analogy tends to break down in the case
of mass toxic torts and punitive damages.  Unanticipated awards,
such as those that resulted from the imposition of retroactive
liability, by their very nature cannot be recouped in the marketplace.
 Cases such as those that led to the bankruptcy or reorganization
of the affected firms likewise do not lend themselves to an insurance
role.  Moreover, the types of court awards that are made do not
simply provide insurance of medical costs and other income losses
of accident victims but instead provide for amounts well beyond
these losses.  Such awards will not be valued by prospective consumers
of the product since this is not the type of insurance they would
choose to purchase.  Consequently their cost will not be fully
reflected in the purchase price that consumers are willing to
pay.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The DCBs would, of course, have liability to
the companies as well as to potential consumers.  In particular,
the product certifier would have the responsibility of fulfilling
the terms of its contracts with its clients.  Thus, the certifier
would have the contractual duty to carry out these contract provisions
as well as the tort law duty to provide a workman-like service.<sup><a href="foot.html">34</a></sup>
 The DCB also is subject to the provisions of communicating the
results of its findings to the client.  If the DCB provides false
or inaccurate information, then it is subject to tort liability.<sup><a href="foot.html">35</a></sup>
 Under the theory of negligent misrepresentation the company could
potentially sue the DCB for providing false or inaccurate information.
 Thus, if the company suffered financial losses because of the
false information provided by the DCB and the DCB failed to exercise
reasonable care in obtaining and communicating the information,
then there is a potential basis for a negligence by the company
against the DCB.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The greater practical problem from the standpoint
of DCBs is not whether they are subject to potential liability
actions on the part of corporations purchasing its services but
rather whether third parties injured by the approved products
can obtain liability awards.  As a general rule, U.S. courts have
not found companies responsible for endorsing or certifying products
strictly liable for these defects.  However, a specific legal
exemption from strict liability could ensure that this is the
case and conclusively eliminate the threat of such suits.  The
underlying rationale that has been applied by the courts has been
that the product endorsers or testers are not directly involved
in the manufacturing or the distribution of the product so that
the usual rationales for strict liability are not appropriate.<sup><a href="foot.html">36</a></sup>
 For much the same reasoning, manufacturers have not been held
liable under the theories of breach of warranty.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Our plan's proposal that the DCBs be exposed
to third party suits on grounds of negligence is also consistent
with current legal doctrine in this area.  In situations in which
the courts have first determined that the testers or product certifiers
owed a duty of care to the general public, then negligence rules
have been applied.<sup><a href="foot.html">37</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The underlying reasoning that has led to the
courts determining that product certifiers and testers are potentially
liable can be traced to two principles.  If the individual who
is harmed took actions that were based on reasonable reliance
on the information provided by the certifier/tester and if the
certifier/tester is negligent either in obtaining accurate information
or in presenting it then there is potential liability for whatever
physical harm results from the use of these products.  As a general
rule, companies that are responsible for supplying information
to the public and which will be relied upon by the public in making
their purchasing decisions do have a duty to consumers.<sup><a href="foot.html">38</a></sup>  Of course
in the case of the role of DCBs with respect to product certification,
this aspect of liability will be complicated by the fact that
the FDA has the final sign-off in this review process.  Thus,
it must be the case that it is the DCB and not the FDA that is
responsible for the negligence.  The key issue is whether the
DCB has been careless or negligent in carrying out its responsibilities,
which is a much narrower basis for liability than is the case
for the pharmaceutical companies.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >To summarize, the major changes being proposed
with respect to the liability system pertain both to the current
liability regime as well as the proposed new regulatory structure.
 In particular, the proposal models a regulatory compliance defense
for pharmaceuticals and devices both with respect to punitive
damages and liability more generally.  The plan proposals to revise
the FDA drug and device approval process would not alter the pertinence
or applicability of these legal reforms.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The specific new legal issues that are raised
by the reform proposals pertain to the potential liability of
the DCBs.  If this potential liability is substantial, then entry
into this market will be discouraged and the desired competition
will not be forthcoming.  For the most part, the desired legal
changes needed to accompany this new regulatory mechanism simply
involve clarification of the existing legal structure to eliminate
residual uncertainties.  Potential contractual liability of the
DCBs to the companies purchasing their services would be present
and is entirely appropriate.  The greater dangers are those posed
by strict liability and negligence claims involving the products
tested by the DCBs.  Past legal precedent suggests that strict
liability claims are unlikely to be upheld by the court, but to
eliminate the risk of potentially catastrophic losses we propose
that there be a formal legal exemption from strict liability suits.
 As under the current legal regime, DCBs would be subject to potential
suits with respect to negligence, as indeed they should since
one would want to preserve the incentives for them to carry out
their duties in an efficient manner.<BR>

<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>

<P>
<FONT >The pharmaceutical and medical device industry
is in many respects an anomaly with respect to its legal status.
 This industry has been the target of some of the most pathbreaking
and costly product liability suits.  Indeed, not only is the liability
burden for the pharmaceutical and medical device industry quite
high, it is extremely disproportionate to its sales when compared
to other manufacturing industries.  By almost any objective standard,
the pharmaceutical industry is an outlier in terms of the extent
to which it has been hard hit by the rise in liability costs.
 These liability costs have been of substantial practical consequence,
as they have served as a deterrent to innovation and have discouraged
entry into important areas of product development.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >What is perhaps most disturbing about these
high liability costs is that they have been coupled with a regulatory
regime that is extremely stringent, certainly more stringent than
what is in place for any other major class of consumer products.
 Pharmaceutical products are subjected to extensive pre-market
testing and even extensive review before they are permitted to
be tested.  After having been tested and shown to be both safe
and effective, pharmaceutical products are marketed under restricted
market conditions in which a physician must prescribe prescription
drugs before they can be purchased.  In addition, the product
is accompanied by an on-product warning or a patient package insert,
the wording of which is specifically approved by the Food and
Drug Administration and is in large part drafted by the Food and
Drug Administration to be in conformance with a standardized warnings
vocabulary.  After the products are on the market, the Food and
Drug Administration undertakes considerable effort with respect
to surveillance of products and monitoring of adverse effects
that are reported to it.  This extremely vigorous regulatory regime
ensures that the usual tort liability objective of striking an
appropriate balance in the promotion of safety for the product
has been achieved.  Indeed, most critics of the FDA suggest that
the FDA errs on the side of excessive caution leading to too few
innovative new drugs reaching the market.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In the presence of such stringent regulatory
criteria, one wonders why the pharmaceutical industry has been
the object of such extensive litigation.  The reason is not that
the FDA's judgements were in error.  Rather, in some cases new
information becomes apparent over time, which could not have been
known by either the company or by the FDA without even a more
extensive testing process that would have delayed potentially
beneficial drugs from reaching the market even longer.  More important
is that in a regime of strict liability the company will assume
responsibility for insuring any adverse outcomes that occur in
any patient population group.  In some cases there may be adverse
reactions to a drug that lead to a patient injury and a subsequent
lawsuit.  In other instances, the causality may be difficult to
ascertain.  Pharmaceutical companies with their relatively deep
pockets may be held accountable for the losses even though their
product did not in fact cause the injury.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The liability regime we propose would remedy
the inequities created by a liability system that currently imposes
stringent penalties on an industry that already is subject to
extensive regulatory requirements.  A strong regulatory compliance
defense would recognize the role that FDA standards play in addressing
the product safety issue.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Other legal issues are also created by a broader
reform effort.  Under the proposed regulatory process for pharmaceuticals
and medical devices outlined here, DCBs would be potentially subject
to suits from both companies purchasing their services as well
as injured plaintiffs.  Suits on the part of companies that are
attempting to hold the DCBs to their contractual obligations are
entirely appropriate and should be permitted.  In addition, suits
against the DCBs on the basis of negligence in carrying our their
review functions also are appropriate.  At present, certifiers
such as Underwriters' Laboratory are not typically subject to
strict liability.  Nevertheless, it is appropriate to give DCBs
a formal exemption from strict liability in order to eliminate
the low probability chance of a high loss event that may lead
to the insolvency of the DCB.  The prospect of such suits would
deter entry into the DCB arena, which would not be a desirable
outcome.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The legal proposals accompanying our plan simply
involve recognition of the need for a regulatory compliance defense
and codifying the existing legal regime to provide a degree of
assurance that the current legal landscape will not be altered
in a way that will affect DCBs adversely.  Given the past performance
of the liability system, such as the imposition of retroactive
liability in the asbestos cases, the need for a safe harbor for
DCBs even on a limited basis may be desirable in reducing unreasonable
exposures to liability.  The overall objective of legal sanctions
is to maintain the incentives for efficient behavior on the part
of DCBs, and this can be done by adopting the legal reforms that
we have proposed.</FONT>

<P>
<ol>
<li> Clearly, the FDA reports to more than one
Congressional committee, so that the Weingast and Moran argument
is more complicated than the idea of a single, dominant overseer.
 Also, it is not clear that the FDA has responded much to advice
to loosen up, which suggests that it is more of a captive of committees
which criticize the agency for being too easy on industry.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<li>  The following discussion is meant to be
suggestive of how to analyze this case in slightly more formal
terms.  It can be skipped without loss of continuity.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<li>   An important semantical point needs to
be made here. Self-certification in the present discussion simply
means letting the market work, including the adoption of the standards
under which self-certification would take place. In other contexts
in this study self-certification will mean letting firms meet
an exogeneously determined set of standards (e.g., for Class I
medical devices) on their own. Government is not involved in the
former case, while it is involved in setting and policing standards
in the latter case.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<li>  The &quot;lemons&quot; problem resides in
the fact that buyers do not know the true quality of products
before they purchase and use them.  Hence, they tend to overvalue
lower quality products and to undervalue higher quality products.
 This means that only the lower quality products will be sold
in market equilibrium.  Owners of higher quality products will
not supply them for sales because they are systematically undervalued
by the market.  The market for used cars may be used as an example
of the &quot;lemons&quot; problem.  The analysis can also be translated
to the market for medical treatment. There is a pervasive history
of fraud in medical treatment and a tendency for the system to
degenerate into scams. The ease of fraud and scams is the reason
alternative medicines are so popular, such as shark cartilage
for cancer and arthritis treatment.<BR>

no longer supplies biomedical materials. For one implant alone,
Du Pont has expended $8 million dollars per year for 5 years to

&quot;Each implant contained about five cents's worth of Teflon.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<li>  The 1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act gave the FDA statutory authority to take regulatory action
if a device was produced under unsanitary conditions, was dangerous
if used as directed, or it's labeling was misleading, did not
contain adequate instructions for use or did not identify the
manufacturer. For a legislative history of device regulation through
the late 1980's see: Hutt PB, A History of Government Regulation

Regulation of Medical Devices. New England Journal of Medicine
317:357-66, 1987. In this article, Dr. Kessler (before he became
FDA Commissioner) wrote: &quot;the FDA's extensive reliance on
the 510(k) pathway to reduce the number of devices that require
premarketing approval - and consequently its own workload - is
destined to fail. As technology advances, the number of devices
legitimately found to be substantially equivalent to devices marketed
before 1976 will diminish markedly. If the FDA does not soon develop
other acceptable mechanisms for dealing with new devices, practical
considerations will force it to stretch the statute further, making
the regulation of medical devices even more perplexing.&quot;</FONT>

<li>  Wilkerson Group (1995), p. 78.</FONT>
<P>
<li>  The 1976 Food Drug and Cosmetic Act at least
technically offered the opportunity for the manufacturer to market
a device under section 510(k) 90 days after notification of the
FDA. The 1990 amendments removed this option and the manufacturer,
under the threat of severe penalties, must await an FDA &quot;order&quot;
giving permission to go to market.</FONT>
<P>
<li>  Briones (1995), p. 17. Statistical analysis
of data based on the date the PMA was submitted, by necessity,
does not include PMA's that were still pending at the time of
analysis. When these PMA's are finally acted upon, perhaps many
years after originally submitted, the average elapsed time will
increase. This phenomenon is more important for PMA's than 510(k)'s
as they typically require much more time and are not acted upon
in the year that they are filed.</FONT>

estimates of the time required for device approvals in the United

Of the companies surveyed, 61 percent market products offshore
before marketing in the United States. Sixty nine percent anticipated
that the delay would be between 1 and 3 years (pp. 89-91).</FONT>

<li>  George WW. Which Way FDA?. Medical Device
&amp; Diagnostic Industry. 17(12):22-24, 1995. William George,
CEO of Medtronics, states that of their &quot;last 15 major new
product lines or ventures, all have been developed, tested and
produced first in Europe. All will be available first to patients
overseas well before they are introduced to patients in the United
States. Overall, the gap between commercial availability of new
therapies in Europe and the United States has widened from 1 to
2 years to 5 to 7 years.&quot; The author has heard similar statements
from knowledgeable sources in the American device industry.</FONT>
<P>
<li>  In 1994, the Gallop Organization interviewed
58 executives of member companies of the American Electronics
Association and prepared a &quot;Survey of Medical Device Manufacturers
Concerning the Strategic and Economic Impact of the Federal Regulatory
Process.&quot; They looked at the impact of the experience of
these companies with the current 510(k) approval process. Fifteen
percent of these executives reported that their experience has
led them to relocate manufacturing operations outside of the United
States, 35% reported placing a greater emphasis on R&amp;D outside
the U.S. and 59% reported that more products are released outside
the U.S. that in the past.</FONT>
<P>
<li>  Commissioner Kessler in his April 6, 1995
statement before the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources
stated that &quot;Today, the Clinton Administration is announcing
a number of initiatives to improve the speed and efficiency of
the drug and device review process... I would like to submit for
the record FDA's report on regulatory reform in drug and medical
device review. These reforms ... have been developed under the
leadership of Vice President Gore's National Performance Review...
Some of the reforms we announce speak directly to reduced time
for review and approval. Others aim to reduce excessive regulatory
burdens... They will result ... in annual cost savings for industry
of $500 million.&quot; There is currently little debate concerning
whether reform is needed. The only question is which reforms are
best.</FONT>
<P>
<li>  The FDA has recently announced it's &quot;policy
on the development of standards with respect to international
harmonization of regulatory requirements and guidelines&quot;
(Federal Register, vol. 60, no. 196, pp.53078-84, October 11,
1995). The FDA states that &quot;harmonization enhances public
health protection and improves governmental efficiencies by reducing
both unwarranted contradictory regulatory requirements and redundant
applications of similar requirements by multiple regulatory bodies.&quot;
However, taken as a whole, the announced policy has so many caveats
that it is evident that the FDA is still not enthusiastically
embracing the harmonization of standards with Western Europe.
In fact the announcement overtly states that this &quot;policy
document does not ... bind FDA in any way.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<li>  European Council Directive of 14 June 1993
Concerning Medical Devices, Annex I, gives the details of the
14 essential requirements.</FONT>
<P>
<li>  The question of why the FDA, despite the
mandates of the 1976 law, failed to develop performance standards,
while the European system successfully relies upon them is elucidated
by Commissioner Kessler writing (NEJM 317:357-66, 1987) that &quot;the
development of 800 performance standards for the 800 types of
Class II devices, which has been estimated to require 50,000 staff
years, would probably exceed the capacity of the agency under
any circumstances.&quot;  In the European system there is no need
for a vast staff as they take full advantage of the myriad of
non-governmental standards setting bodies in a multitude of countries;
they have the flexibility to use generic standards as well as
standards that apply only to a single device; they, in many cases,
use standards to validate the manufacturer's quality assurance
systems instead of individual device standards; and finally they
allow the manufacture to devise <I>ad hoc</I> methods of proving
conformance with the &quot;essential requirements&quot; instead
of or to supplement relying on published standards. This approach
has allowed for more flexibility than relying primarily on a monolithic
federal agency.</FONT>

contains the details of the classification criteria.</FONT>
<P>
<li>  The full set of EU quality assurance standards
(which are similar to the ISO 9000 series of standards commonly
used in the United States) is equivalent to a super set of the
FDA's GMP requirements in that they also include standards for
ensuring the quality of the design process. The FDA has announced
that it intends to add design quality assurance to its GMP's in
the future.</FONT>

<li>  Magazine AH, Hunt MI. The U.S. Medical Device
Industry Moves Offshore. Medical Device &amp; Diagnostic Industry.
17(8):72-79, 1995. According to a recent survey, &quot;seventy
percent of all companies and 84% of development-stage firm moving
clinical trials offshore rate 'FDA uncertainty and unpredictability'
as a critical element in their decision.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<li>  Wilkerson (1955) pp. 217-27. This lists
100 specific medical devices, currently available in Europe, Canada,
Australia and/or Japan, which are currently not available to patients
in the United States.  Eventual FDA approval is expected for most
of these products. In general, these devices relate to the diagnosis
and treatment of severe disease. For example, 31 of the 100 are
related to coronary artery disease, structural cardiac abnormalities
or congestive heart failure. To the extent that they are more
efficacious than devices currently available in the United States,
regulatory delay may be responsible for unnecessary morbidity
and mortality.</FONT>
<P>
<li>  Less than the Sum of its Parts (1993) p.
81. The House report states: &quot;Clinical utility is the Agency's
[FDA's] requirement that a device manufacturer prove not only
does the device work as claimed, but that patient's health also
improves as a result of the device's action.&quot; &quot;Since
... ODE is barely able to perform the review presently required
by statute, it makes little sense for it to add routinely the
burden of assessing clinical utility to its review process.&quot;
 There is a critical distinction between the EU's concept of requiring
evidence of clinical efficacy and the FDA's requirement for evidence
of clinical utility. The former is related to demonstrating that
the device has the claimed effect; the latter, that the device's
effect is clinically beneficial. For example, the manufacture
of a mechanical ventilator that breathes for a patient may claim
that it delivers large breath volumes at a slow rate. The EU system
would require that this claim be verified and that the gas really
goes into the patient's lungs as claimed; the FDA system would
require that it be shown that this type of ventilation is, in
some sense, good for some subset of patients. In the EU system,
such medical questions are normally outside the domain of the
device regulations (unless, of course, the device manufacturer
makes an implicit or explicit claim of clinical utility).</FONT>
<P>
<li>  Less than the Sum of its Parts (1993) pp.
71-3. This congressional report quotes the head of the FDA Division
of Product Surveillance as stating that the current device reporting
&quot;system doesn't work and everyone knows it doesn't.&quot;
The report concludes that &quot;The weakness of CDRH's MDR system
reflects an FDA-wide problem with its failure to use management
information systems effectively&quot; and that little has changed
since the GAO came to a similar conclusion in their 1989 report.
The report continues on p. 91: &quot;The MDR system currently
cannot serve as an early warning system ... and it makes little
sense to invest additional resources into this system given its
many flaws. The Agency's chronic problems in this area may make
it necessary to have an independent expert contractor develop
a practical and useful system.&quot; For devices, because they
way that they are actually used cannot be fully determined before
actual marketing, postmarket surveillance is at least as important
as premarket review. Fortunately, it is in the interest of responsible
manufacturers to have their own, generally very effective, systems
to act on device problems discovered in the post-marketing period.</FONT>

<title>What Is Policy Review -- Heritage</title>
<META name="keyword" content="Policy Review: Journal of American Citizenship, community, conservative, journal, families, family, local, civic, religious, schools, education, citizens">

<h2><i>POLICY REVIEW: The Journal of American Citizenship</i></h2></center>
<p>
<i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i>, the flagship magazine of <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>, is published 6 times per year. 
<p>
<i>Policy Review</i> specializes in the study of private-sector and local-government alternatives to the bureaucratic, centralized welfare state. We are dedicated to rebuilding the institutions of American citizenship -- families, neighborhoods, religious institutions, public and private schools, voluntary civic institutions, businesses, and local governments.
<p>
<i>Policy Review</i> profiles great American citizens: Houston constable Victor Trevino is reducing crime with his "zebra squad" of volunteer cops; Sister Connie Driscoll is helping young urban mothers in Chicago; <a href="/heritage/p_review/spring95/tolerth.html">Rev. Frank Reid</a>, of Baltimore's AME Church, is promoting black Christian manhood to the members of his community.
<p>
We study "what works": <a href="/heritage/p_review/spring95/glassth.html">DeVry Institute of Technology</a> sets the standard for career training; Rhode Island's privatized school lunch program tastes better and costs less; private security officers reduce crime around New York's Grand Central Station. 
<p>
We tackle tough subjects, and propose common-sense policy prescriptions, for issues such as <a href="/heritage/p_review/fall95/thegg.html">crime</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/thfost.html">taxes</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/fall95/thhood.html">environment</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/fall95/thfinn.html">education</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/fall95/thsher.html">religion and culture</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/thcraig.htm">adoption and foster care</a>, and <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/thbear.html">Social Security</a>. We publish articles by influential people on the major issues of the day. Newt Gingrich, Phil Gramm, <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/tharmey.html">Dick Armey</a>, Bill Bennett, Ralph Reed, Bill Kristol, Kate O'Beirne, Grover Norquist, and other key policy makers all contribute to <i>Policy Review</i>.
<p>
<i>Policy Review</i> provides practical, constructive thought -- the best of conservatism-in-action.

<h1><center>The Center for Political Renewal</center></h1>
<p>

The purpose of the Center for Political Renewal is to examine the revolutionary
changes now underway in American politics and develop the principles and the
agenda that will guide the next majority political coalition. Big Change may lead
to a revolution in American governance and civic affairs.<p>

The work of the Center for Political Renewal consists of two related endeavors:
The work of Foundation distinguished Senior Fellow <a href="/pff/people/sfellow.html#Weber">Vin Weber</a> on his book, The New
Majority; and the work of the Center itself in developing a set of principles and
an agenda to guide the next successful political coalition to produce a
(peaceful) revolution in American governance and civic affairs.<p>

In The New Majority, Weber looks at the current political upheavals from a
historical perspective and outlines the principles of an emerging majority
coalition -- which may be a "new" Democratic party, a "new" Republican party or,
conceivably, a new party by a different name. <p>

Weber's work is reinforced by other Center activities. For example, in November
1994, the Center sponsored a major post-election poll whose stunning results were
reported in <a href="http://www.wsj.com">The Wall Street Journal</a>. Among its findings were that "a tidal wave
of voter discontent with government in general, and <A HREF="http://thomas.loc.gov/home/thomas.html">Congress</A> in particular, was
responsible for the loss of dozens of incumbent Democrats who failed to heed the
warning signs." The study found that by nearly 15 to 1, Americans believe the
Federal government is "much too big and has too much power."<p>

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT></B>he alienation of African-American men from the churches of their communities 
is perhaps the single greatest tragedy facing black America. "While 75 percent of the 
mosque is male, 75 percent of the black church is female," laments Jawanza Kunjufu, 
author of <I>Adam Where Are You?: Why Most Black Men Don't Go to Church</I>. It wasn't 
always so: In earlier generations, black men were much more involved in the church, and 
their religious faith bolstered their commitment to families and neighborhoods. The most 
effective way to reduce black crime, and to strengthen black families, may be to return 
African-American men to their spiritual roots.</P>
<P>	A church in Baltimore that is itself returning to its roots is making great headway 
in its ministry to men. Bethel AME Church, founded in 1785, is the second-oldest church 
in the African Methodist Episcopal denomination and a venerable institution squarely in 
the black political mainstream. Bethel hosted much of the NAACP's national summit last 
year. Its pastor, Frank Madison Reid III, is the son and grandson of AME bishops, and his 
step-brother is Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke. Reid was educated at Yale University 
and Harvard Divinity School. A veteran of the civil-rights movement, he served later as 
pastor of Ward AME Church, an important congregation in Los Angeles. He has earned a 
black belt in karate, a prominent image as a local television personality, and a position as 
an intellectual leader of the African-American church.</P>

<H3>A Growing Concern</H3>
<P>	When Reid, 43, was named pastor of Bethel in 1989, the congregation had 7,000 
members, 25 percent of them men. Today, its membership numbers 10,000, 40 percent of 
whom are men. Each week, 4,400 of the faithful attend one of the two Sunday services, 
and 45 percent of them are men. Secular agencies and politicians who want to improve 
urban life should take note of Reid's ministry. Black men in his congregation have 
reconciled with their wives, resumed responsibilities to their children and communities, 
committed themselves to becoming productive citizens, and dedicated themselves to God.</P>
<P>	Rare among traditional black churches, economic classes mix at Bethel. The 
church is located in the Druid Hill section of Baltimore, a historically working-class 
neighborhood now infested with drugs and dilapidated public-housing projects, but it 
draws its membership from middle-class suburbs as well as the surrounding 
neighborhood. At services, blue-jean-clad youths pray while holding hands with middle-
aged professionals and families dressed in their Sunday best.</P> 
<P>	Reid attributes the growth of his congregation to a return to its Methodist roots. 
The Methodist movement, started by Charles and John Wesley in England in the 18th 
century, was spread throughout America by preachers such as George Whitefield. When 
Richard Allen and other blacks were barred from praying in a Methodist church in 
Philadelphia in the late 1700s, they established the AME church. Early Methodism 
emphasized moral rectitude and discipline, revivalism, the study of Scripture in Bible 
groups, and personal conversion. The movement played a leading role in the national 
crusades against drunkenness and slavery. "We meet the spiritual needs of the people 
because of our focus on prayer and the mystical nature of connection between the 
individual human being and the Holy Spirit," says Reid.</P>
<P>	Worship at Bethel is boisterous; dancing and shouting infuse the atmosphere. 
Reid sees this as a return to the spirit of early Methodism, when religious intensity 
energized powerful campaigns for the betterment of society. Reid points with pride to the 
18th-century English Methodists who "went into the prisons and streets with a revival 
that saved England from the same revolutionary fate as France." And he cites as a model 
the 1870s revival at Philadelphia's Bethel AME Church, which prompted a moral uplift 
in the city's black population.</P>
<P>	Reid's ministry to men is in the early Methodist tradition of vigorous outreach to 
the unchurched, wherever they may be found. As the pastor of Ward AME in the early 
1980s, Reid concluded that the church wasn't addressing the needs of young men on the 
street. He also wondered why black males were joining the Nation of Islam or Los 
Angeles gangs like the Bloods and Crips, but not the Protestant churches. "Jesus said, `I 
will make you fishers of men,' " he says. "But either the church wasn't using the right 
bait or the lines weren't strong enough to bring the fish into the church."</P> 
<P>	How does Reid reel the men in at Bethel?  His television services encourage men 
to visit the church.  Highly approachable, he invites men to attend his church when he 
meets them on Baltimore's streets in his daily travels.  His use of the term "brother" 
suggests kinship and inspires male members to actively urge their friends to accompany 
them to Bethel.</P>  
<P>	Reid also uses a four-step plan that relies on "respect" for black males, teaching 
the "roots" of Christianity, "reformation" of habits, and "resurrection" of lives.  At 
Sunday services, male visitors are welcomed with applause and hugs. "We want to 
express our joy for your presence in the Lord's house," Reid says from the pulpit.</P>   
<P>	 Reid recently invited Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam to speak at Bethel. 
Reid disagrees with Farrakhan's theology and racial and religious separatism. But Reid 
wanted men who are attracted to Farrakhan to be exposed to a church that emphasizes 
Christian manliness.</P>
<P>	Men who visit Bethel also find an atmosphere that is masculine as well as 
feminine, unlike many of the churches they are used to. At age 13 or so, many black 
youths tend to drop out of church. "At that age, black males who were once drawn to the 
choir as youth no longer sing, because robes look like dresses," says Reid. "Their Sunday 
school teacher, superintendent, and youth adviser are women. Their reaction to the 
religious femininity of the church drives them out of the church and into the seduction of 
a gang."</P>
<P>	At Bethel, men as well as women occupy important board and teaching positions, 
and Reid makes sure that men won't have to leave the church to find opportunities for 
brotherhood. In addition to all-female Bible study and family Bible programs, Bethel 
offers weekly all-male Bible classes. There, stories from Scripture inspire men to talk 
freely about difficulties in their relations with women, and--Reid calls this a common 
problem among black men--the resentment they may feel toward absent, domineering, or 
abusive fathers.</P> 
<P>	Every November, Bethel hosts a month-long celebration of men. Last year's 
activities included a retreat, African martial-arts experts, scholarly lectures, a Men's Day 
with noted personalities like talk-show host Tony Brown, and a week-long revival service 
at which 67 men, including some substance abusers, joined the church. </P>
<P>	Reid also attracts men to Bethel by setting strict standards of individual moral 
responsibility. Foul language, lying, cheating, and adultery are simply not tolerated. No 
drinking, smoking, or blasphemy is allowed in the congregation. In his sermons, Reid 
cautions the men against excessive anger, spitefulness, and abusive behavior created by 
high stress and low self-esteem. He advises them to restrain their anger through a close 
relationship with Christ. "If men are unable to handle their emotions," he says, "then they 
become prime candidates for abusing their wives or girlfriends and children, as well as 
their friends and neighbors and, ultimately, the community."</P>
<P>	Reid is convinced that exacting standards of behavior do not drive men away, but 
attract them. Men are empowered by morality, he says; they gain courage and conviction 
when they know they are acting responsibly. He argues that the appeal of Malcolm X and 
Louis Farrakhan comes more from their moral authority than their religion. Christianity, 
too, must emphasize its firmness along with its love and compassion. "Jesus drew strong 
fishermen to him," Reid says. "His moral authority was a magnet."</P>
<P>	Reid challenges the males in his congregation to be men rather than boys. "You 
can be 65 and still be a boy," he preaches. "You can be 45, married with children, and 
still be a boy. The difference between a boy and a man is that a man loves God and takes 
responsibility for himself and others."</P> 
<P>	Many congregants fail to live up to the church's standards. But all men are 
welcome. No stigma is placed on former convicts and drug-abusers. At each service, Reid 
asks men who have been incarcerated to stand and be applauded. Reid preaches that 
everybody in the church is sinful, citing the biblical injunction, "We were born in sin and 
shaped in iniquity, and we all have fallen short of the glory of God." </P>
<P>	Bethel provides wrongdoers with encouragement coupled with discipline. Biblical 
passages are cited to show why the behavior in question is wrong. The church is firm in 
response to wrongful deeds, but forgiving. The man admits his error, and he and Reid 
discuss ways to make restitution and bring healing for the wrongs he has committed. Reid 
strongly emphasizes restitution, arguing that one has a responsibility to bring wholeness 
to that which one has broken.</P>
<P>	Changa Onyanga used to be a lieutenant in the drug culture. When he first entered 
Bethel to visit a former member of his gang, he had no respect for ministers like Reid. "I 
looked him up and down and pressed on." Onyanga says now. "I did not speak to him. 
Besides, preachers had a bad rap because they were not doing anything for people who 
needed a cause to champion."</P>
<P>	Reid noted Onyanga's "terrible disposition" and responded. "No one walks 
around this church and does not speak," Reid said to him. "We are friendly and we speak 
to one another as Christians should." Reid had Onyanga's friend talk to him and teach 
him about the decorum of his church. Onyanga has since joined Bethel.</P>
<P>	In preaching personal responsibility, Reid acknowledges his own errors. Happily 
married with two daughters, eight and two, Reid also fathered a son out of wedlock 
during an earlier pastorate in Charlotte, North Carolina. "I do not deny my 15-year-old 
son," says Reid. "He is a reality." Although his son lives with the mother, Reid remains a 
significant part of his life. He provides monetary and moral support and communicates 
regularly. Reid even has him stand up in the congregation when he comes to visit.</P>
<P>	Reid tells the men that he has been where some of them are. Once they see that 
their spiritual leader is not above temptation, he believes, the men in his congregation can 
grapple more easily with issues of manhood and sexuality. </P>
<P>	Reid argues that spiritual leaders must be honest with men about their own 
failings. Some black men resist attending church because they regard the preachers as 
hypocrites. Reid chides his fellow clergy for not practicing what they preach. "Just 
because they received the calling," he says, "does not mean they are above the struggle or 
the contradictions." Citing St. Augustine and other great religious teachers who have 
acknowledged their sinfulness, he says pastors must realize they are preaching to 
themselves as well as to their congregations. </P>
<P>	Reid's ministry to men includes working with women to restore male authority in 
the home. Men will be better fathers and husbands and will participate more willingly in 
church and community life, Reid argues, if they are allowed to exercise authority as head 
of the household. This does not mean tyranny or dictatorial control, but rather loving 
responsibility. Reid teaches men to be the protector, priest, provider, and partner of the 
household. The Old Testament instructs the man to be "watchman for his family."</P>
<P>	"We teach that the man should be the first person his wife goes to for prayer," 
Reid says. "If there is need for the pastor to come into the household, then it should be to 
pray for the family. But that can only happen if the man takes the leadership in making 
prayer a part of the household. The man should take the leadership for making sure Bible 
study is part of family life." Reid preaches that wives should submit to their husbands, 
but also that husbands must not abuse this authority. "Paul's letter to the Ephesians 
teaches us: `Woman, submit thyself if your man loves you as Jesus loves the church,' "  
he says. "If the husband does not love his wife as Jesus loved the church, then she has no 
responsibility to submit to him. We submit to Jesus out of the fact that he loved us." </P>
<P>	The principle of male headship does not mean that the husband must be the 
primary breadwinner. "We teach the men that wives' earnings should not bruise their 
ego," says Reid. "A husband should be thankful when a woman who earns more, or has 
more education, looks to him as protector and provider." The word "provider," Reid 
points out, comes from the Latin for "seeing." It means supplying a family's vision as 
much as providing its material sustenance.</P>
<P>	Reid also teaches women how to respond to men in the household. Annette 
Brown, for example, used Reid's sermon on "a loving God" to endure six years of 
estrangement from her husband, Kevin. "There were times when my husband was gone 
for four days without contact," says Brown, "but pastor Reid's message told me to look 
beyond his faults and see his needs." Annette and Kevin are back together, and their 
relationship is stronger. He has joined Bethel and resumed his role as father of their two 
sons. He has even begun to prepare for the ministry.</P>
<P>	Brown is the religious leader and disciplinarian of the household. He is also in 
charge of sex education. Brown settles family decisions after family prayer. Matters in 
which he reserves the final say include private school for their children, vacations, family 
transportation, his work hours, visits to relatives, and house-buying. But his wife controls 
the household finances. She submits to him because he submits to the church. "Kevin 
takes the authority in the household," she says. "When there is a decision, he makes the 
final decision." She reserves the right to veto any decision not in the family's best 
interest, but she adheres to Biblical scripture: Better to live on a corner of the roof than 
share a house with a quarrelsome wife. "I always uplift my husband," she says.</P>
<P>	Reid denies that this approach oppresses women. "I have not talked to a single 
African-American woman," he says, "who has said `no' when I have asked whether she 
would gladly submit to a man who loved Christ, who provided for her and her children, 
who would protect her, and was spiritual. They recognize that the submission would not 
be an oppressive submission, but a submission in partnership." </P>
<P>	Reid encourages men to marry or, if they are separated, to reunite with the 
mothers of their children. But he does not always counsel marriage. "It makes no sense," 
he says, "to push together a couple that does not love each other. If the mother has 
become pregnant for the wrong reasons--out of lust, for example, or to get welfare 
payments--then it may not be possible for the father to exercise loving authority as head 
of the household."</P>
<P>	"In an ideal world, it is easy to say, `if you make a baby, then marry the mother,' " 
Reid says. "But as a pastor, I have to deal with the hard facts of family conflict. What 
happens to the child who grows up in a home where the parents hate each other because 
you made them get married? The child will grow up with their hostility and take it out 
into the world."</P> 
<P>	Reid thinks public policy treats African-American men with illegitimate children 
too harshly. He is especially troubled by a court system that cuts fathers off from their 
children. Men are presumed guilty in disputes over child support; visitation can be denied 
at the mother's request. Reid says the system "tortures fathers, who often want to do the 
right thing for their children, and is unfairly slanted toward the mother."</P>
<P>	According to Reid, models of Christian manhood from African and African-
American history are essential in attracting black men to church. Before becoming full 
members of Bethel, men must spend an hour with the pastor, who teaches them about 
Africans in the Bible and African-American church history. In this portion of his 
ministry, which he calls "roots," Reid tries to dispel the notion that Christianity is a 
Eurocentric, slave masters' religion. He teaches about the Africans Simeon (also called 
Niger) and Lucius of Cyrene, who ordained the Apostle Paul and Silas. He talks about the 
black abolitionist David Walker, who in 1829 published an anti-slavery tract known as 
the Appeal. This seminal publication demanded the end of slavery and appealed to the 
"God of the Ethiopians." </P> 
<P>	Another of Reid's models of black Christian manhood is Bishop Henry McNeil 
Turner. Born a slave in South Carolina, Turner became the first black chaplain of the 
Union army, a member of the South Carolina Legislature, and an advocate for the black 
emigration to Africa in 1874. His status as a bishop in the African Methodist Episcopal 
Church allowed him to carry the African-American religious tradition to South Africa 
more than 100 years ago. </P> 
<P>	Reid also likes to point out to his African-American audience that Jesus may not 
have been as European-looking as Hollywood and other forms of  popular culture 
typically have portrayed him--white, blue-eyed, and fair-haired. He quotes a passage 
from the Old Testament book of Daniel that describes the Messiah, whose "feet were like 
burnished brass and his hair was like lamb's wool," and the New Testament book of 
Revelation, which similarly describes Jesus with feet "like bronze glowing in a furnace." 
Some church members, such as Charles Wiggins, say they were greatly affected by 
Reid's more raw, human portrait of Christ. "I had never heard a minister talk about Jesus 
who looked like me," says Wiggins, who joined in 1991. "I have found a home."</P>
<P>	Reid brings in guest lecturers to talk about African-American manhood. In a 
recent program, Na'im Akbar, a Florida State psychologist who is an expert on black 
male psychology, urged men at Bethel to learn from "the courage of Dr. King, the 
defiance of the honorable Elijah Muhammed, the economic strategy of Booker T. 
Washington, and the uncompromising integrity of Paul Robeson."</P>
<P>	Reid encourages the men to spiritually mold young males of the community. 
Through Project RAISE, they mentor teenagers from local schools. The men do not 
pressure them to join the church, but some do, attending Sunday services and Bible study 
with their mentors.</P>
<P>	After a small riot erupted at Booker T. Washington Junior High School just before 
Christmas last year, Bethel began a direct partnership with the school. To prevent a 
reoccurrence, Reid summoned 150 men to the school. They lined the street in front of the 
school and remained watchful for arsonists, gangs, and visiting troublemakers. At the 
request of the principal, the men recently returned to supervise the children in the 
morning and afternoon. The pupils' tranquillity prompted one teacher to comment that 
they were "acting like children again."</P>
<P>	Bethel assists men in running their households. In the class for new members, 
men are shown how to allocate their earnings. The 10-10-80 plan is a voluntary financial-
management procedure wherein 10 percent of the new member's yearly earnings is 
contributed to the church. Another 10 percent goes into a savings account, while the 
remainder is used for living expenses. </P>
<P>	Men who need additional help in managing their finances can attend classes on 
preparing tax returns, taught by a CPA who donates her time. Bethel has helped its 
members form food co-ops and investment clubs for pooling risk capital, purchasing 
bonds and mutual funds, and setting up funds for children's college tuition.</P>
<P>	Reid and members of the congregation also find jobs for men. Some have 
convictions for crack use, weapons possession, or other felonies, while others possess 
little or no high school or college education. But Reid and other officers at Bethel often 
vouch for the character of church members who might not look good on paper.</P>
<P>	Reid himself hires men as security guards for the church. The security team not 
only protects the church and its membership; it gives young men the opportunity to 
"soldier"--to wear a uniform, carry walkie-talkies, use one's physical strength, and 
become close friends with other men. Reid argues that these are the principal lures of 
being in a gang. So why not channel these male yearnings into structures that help build 
spiritual soldiers?</P>
<P>	The security guards are called the Mighty Men of God after the warriors who 
followed King David.  There is no better symbol than these men of Reid's teaching that 
Christianity is a manly as well as a womanly religion. The Mighty Men of God hold 
respected positions in the church, including the leader of Bible study, sexton, and security 
guard. They are responsible for the safety of the congregation and community, and 
combat random crime with periodic community patrolling. </P>
<P>	The M.M.O.G. play an important role in the safety of the children who attend 
Bethel's day school. They greet parents and students each morning as they arrive. During 
the day, they guard against intruders and drug sales. At the end of the day, a Mighty Man 
of God sees each child safely across the street.</P>
<P>	The regimen of the M.M.O.G. requires discipline. They meet for two hours every 
Tuesday and Saturday. Officers open the meetings with a personal inspection. They 
check for fresh haircuts, cleanshaven faces, and shined shoes. Members are not allowed 
to smoke or drink, so officers check for burns and yellow stains from nicotine or 
marijuana. M.M.O.G. maintain two uniforms: a suit and a security outfit for guarding the 
church.</P>
<P>	After prayer, they discuss local and international events. Drilling, marching, and 
commands soon fill the room. An inspirational message from Reid follows, and the group 
closes with hand-holding prayer.</P>
<P>	One member of the Mighty Men of God is Max Taylor. After joining Bethel at the 
age of 18, Taylor joined forces with local drug dealers and descended into the world of 
drugs, guns, and violence. He was responsible for preparing street corners for potential 
drug sales. "I cleaned street corners for drug dealers by any means necessary," says 
Taylor, 29. He reached a point, he says, when he realized that if he continued he would 
soon "be dead or behind bars for a long time if I was arrested."</P>
<P>	In 1992, Taylor rejoined the church with rejuvenated purpose. He walked through 
local housing complexes challenging drug dealers, his old friends, for territory. "I was 
extremely cold and ruthless," says Taylor, "but due to the power of Frank Reid and God, 
I have changed."</P>

funded job-training program "to keep the American Dream alive in the 21st century." 
Cost to American taxpayers: $3.5 billion a year.</P>
<P>	If he had driven about an hour north, Clinton could have visited a college campus 
that proves his program is unnecessary. DeVry Institute of Technology, headquartered in 
Oakbrook, Illinois, makes a handsome profit by offering a first-rate technical education to 
working-class students. This little-known school shows how private businesses 
outperform government in providing good job training.</P>
<P>	On 13 campuses from Atlanta to Los Angeles, more than 15,000 students--35 
percent of whom are black or Latino--are earning their bachelor's of science degrees at 
DeVry. Ninety-four percent of the school's graduates land jobs in their fields of study 
within six months, with an average starting salary exceeding $24,000 a year.</P>
<P>	DeVry's alumni enjoy cutting-edge technical careers. At Hughes 
Communications, the nation's largest satellite company, 22 of the 30 engineers 
responsible for orbit maintenance are DeVry graduates. KLA Instruments, which designs 
quality-control systems for the manufacture of microchips, boasts that a fifth of its 1,000 
employees graduated from DeVry. All this at an annual cost per student of $2,500 less 
than similar state-run programs.</P>
<P>	And DeVry posted a $12-million profit on revenues of  $211 million last year to 
boot.</P>

<H3>Selling Job Opportunity</H3>
<P>	Since its founding in 1931 by Herman DeVry, the inventor of the portable 
motion-picture projector, the institute has specialized in technical training that leads to 
lucrative careers. DeVry, which grants accredited bachelor's degrees, is a for-profit 
venture whose stock trades on the NASDAQ exchange. In short, it sells job opportunity.</P>
<P>	Five years ago, when Zaneta Rizzo graduated from a small high school in rural 
Louisiana, she "knew less than nothing" about computers, thought DOS was pronounced 
"dose," and was terrified of automatic-teller machines.</P>
<P>	After two years of bouncing among jobs in fast-food restaurants, Rizzo enrolled at 
DeVry's Dallas campus. Recently she graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer 
information systems and is deciding between several job offers with computer-training 
firms. Before DeVry, Rizzo's salary peaked at $760 a month. Her current offers are for 
$25,000 a year--a 275 percent pay hike.</P>
<P>	When Jeri Gomez graduated from high school near Fresno, California, she 
enrolled in a local community college to study the health sciences and dance, but classes 
were constantly being canceled, so she enlisted in the army. After serving in Desert 
Storm, Gomez enrolled at DeVry's Pomona campus. She is now deciding among several 
job offers in software programming that pay more than $30,000 a year.</P>
<P>	Rizzo's and Gomez's stories are typical of DeVry students, many of whom field 
multiple job offers before their commencement. In fact, more than 95 percent of 
engineering and accounting majors are placed in their fields within six months of 
graduation--a success rate many of the nation's top schools never approach. How does 
DeVry do it? By running the college like a business.</P>
<P>	Unlike most colleges, DeVry receives no direct government money or alumni 
gifts. Nearly all revenues, and therefore profits, come from tuition. And DeVry has found 
that the best way to attract more students--over half of whom are the first in their 
families to attend college--is to secure high-paying jobs for graduates. Dennis Keller, 
DeVry's chief executive officer, says the school avoids anything that doesn't help 
students find careers.</P>
<P>	To this end, DeVry maintains an enormous placement system with more than 100 
staffers and a database of thousands of employers. While most other schools in the 
country assign placement officers to handle a broad spectrum of careers, DeVry has 
found that employers prefer to communicate with staffers who understand their particular 
needs. For this reason, each officer is trained in a specific field. For instance, Motorola--
which is based near DeVry's DuPage County campus in northern Illinois--works closely 
with staffers specializing in telecommunications. The payoff has been tremendous. When 
the electronics giant was planning a major expansion in Illinois, it consulted DeVry 
placement officials in advance to secure an educated labor force.</P>
<P>	DeVry also edges out the competition by studying labor trends, nationally as well 
as in the local markets near each campus. DeVry does not depend on the federal 
government's research, which is mostly retrospective; its researchers analyze new and 
growing fields. Using data from interviews with small and large employers, annual 
alumni surveys, and more than a dozen local-industry advisory panels, DeVry graduates 
can target rapidly emerging areas that traditional schools miss. Relying on data from the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics, for instance, most colleges until recently paid little attention to 
the cellular industry. DeVry officials, on the other hand, adjusted their 
telecommunications curriculum eight years ago to include this technology, and 
subsequently launched the careers of many graduates. "Health care is the next big one," 
says Norman Metz, a senior vice president at DeVry. "We are currently focusing on the 
medical-equipment industry that will handle the graying of America."</P>
<P>	Despite these unsurpassed placement results, the Clinton administration has 
frowned upon for-profit schools like DeVry, insisting the capitalist model leads to a 
useless education. At a 1993 press conference, Labor Secretary Robert Reich told 
journalists to be wary of these institutions, claiming that they mismatch thousands of 
students, and that there is no market for their degrees. Reich's warning was reiterated by 
the media, including the Cleveland Plain Dealer, which urged some for-profit schools to 
carry "warning labels" detailing prospective students' chances of finding employment 
after graduation. In fact, if many state schools had to publish such information, students 
would likely flock to DeVry.</P>

<H3>Blood, Sweat, and Jobs</H3>
<P>	Some for-profit trade schools, to be sure, are little more than diploma mills that 
give gullible students a shlock education. These schools usually go bankrupt when 
students catch on that their degree leads nowhere. But for an institution that is in business 
for the long haul, producing high-quality education for satisfied customers is essential to 
growth and profitability. Keller believes that every graduate represents the school: If an 
employer is unsatisfied with the quality of a single graduate's work, he is unlikely to hire 
from DeVry in the future. That would ultimately harm the bottom line.</P>
<P>	To that end, the school maintains a demanding curriculum that students call 
"brutal" and Keller calls "tough love." It is a no-frills, lots-of-sweat education. The 
rigorous process begins even before the classes start. Although the school accepts SAT 
and ACT test scores--applicants average at the 45th percentile--all students are required 
to take DeVry's admissions test in math. About 14 percent of the applicants fail the exam. 
Of the remaining students, about a quarter are admitted on the condition that they take 
remedial classes. Applicants are also required to take a College Board English test that 
determines their placement in humanities courses.</P>
<P>	From the first day, students follow the curriculum in lockstep. There are no 
electives. Students immediately choose a major from among five fields: electronics-
engineering technology, computer information systems, business operations, 
telecommunications management, or accounting. Each major requires eight or nine 
semesters, and can be completed in three years with summer school.</P>
<P>	Students and DeVry's senior management both prefer this inflexible system. Like 
a manufacturer, the school desires a reputation for providing a consistent "product"; 
students say they enjoy receiving firm direction. "This gets rid of a lot of the time-
wasting filler classes, like underwater basket-weaving, that people take elsewhere," 
recalls Rose Huening, a 1986 graduate.</P>

<H3>Heavy Lifting</H3>
<P>	Here there is no time to waste. Each term, DeVry students take at least four 
classes, plus labs, often exceeding a conventional courseload by four to six credit hours. 
The first-year courseload for computer information systems is typical: five computer-
science classes, four computer labs, two math courses and a math lab, two English 
courses with one writing lab, an economics course, a psychology course, and a business 
course. In addition, since many of the students have never before been pushed to work so 
hard, all freshmen enroll in a class on "success strategies," which teaches study skills and 
time-management techniques.</P>
<P>	George Dean, the vice president for educational planning, believes that many 
traditional colleges waste a great deal of energy embracing new teaching methods. DeVry 
doesn't mandate teaching methods--professors can choose whatever textbooks they 
want--but the level of academic expectations is set at the head office, and it's set high. 
"At the end of the course, the students have to be able to do x and y and z," Dean says. 
"If it works better at the Columbus campus to teach it z then y then x, it doesn't bother 
me."</P>
<P>	Dean is comfortable giving the professors ample latitude because they are 
required to gain real-world experience in their field, and so tend to prefer the most 
practical methods. Although some students earn money for tuition by assisting faculty 
members, they are prohibited from teaching, and are usually limited to grading papers.</P>
<P>	Unlike trade schools that teach specific skills (many of which become obsolete as 
technology changes), DeVry's curriculum focuses on teaching students how to reason. In 
many ways, DeVry offers the liberal-arts version of a technical education: students learn 
how to solve technical problems. They are drilled thoroughly on the basics, and required 
to spend countless hours in the lab to build an educational foundation. On exams, 
students are rarely asked straight-forward mathematical questions; instead, they are 
usually given detailed descriptions of real-world problems, including information they 
must recognize as extraneous. Dean claims that this education prepares students to 
operate efficiently in the business world. Furthermore, teachers will fail students whose 
lab reports are not written in proper English, regardless of the experiment's outcome. 
DeVry doesn't shortchange the humanities, because these non-technical abilities will be 
vital to the students' careers. Alumni routinely tell Dean that the technical skills get them 
hired and the reasoning skills get them promoted.</P>
<P>	 A student with a grade point average below a "C" is placed on academic 
probation, and prohibited from taking a relaxed schedule. If the student's g.p.a. remains 
below a "C" average the following semester, he or she is expelled. Every year, 20 percent 
of the student body flunks out. DeVry does not pamper its students en route to the 
diploma. "We have hard classes, but if that is not met with enough commitment to be 
successful, then it is detrimental to this company for that student to stay," Keller says. 
Huening's class is a perfect example: of the 325 students who started, only 94 graduated 
on time.</P> 
<P>	Just as auto manufacturers are constantly reviewing the efficiency of their cars, 
DeVry maintains strict quality control. About a decade ago, DeVry was reviewing each 
course every three years, which was considered swift compared to traditional schools. 
Now it rewrites each course at least once a year. During the summer term, faculty 
members visit hundreds of employers across the nation and find out what their needs will 
be in five to 10 years. Together with information offered by industry leaders on DeVry's 
dozen or so curriculum-advisory boards, the school sets new course requirements. For 
instance, a few years ago most computer-programming courses only taught a 
programming language called COBOL, but professors noted that firms near some of their 
campuses were switching from mainframes to desktop-based systems that require C 
language. After DeVry adjusted its curriculum, businesses responded by hiring more of 
its graduates. Although industry does not dictate DeVry's curriculum, the school must 
measure success and failure by its placement rate.</P>
<P>	The institute's educational audit is exhaustive. DeVry's central headquarters 
evaluates randomly selected writing samples from students on every campus twice a year 
in order to ensure that writing skills remain high. The institute also administers 
standardized tests in electronics to be certain that technical skills are not dropping. 
Finally, administrators also investigate courses with unusual grade distribution.</P>
<P>	The best evidence of the quality of DeVry's curriculum is the on-the-job success 
of its graduates. Bill Buglewicz, a senior manufacturing manager at KLA Instruments, 
recruits at six of the campuses every year. "DeVry students have a great work ethic, 
higher motivation, and initiative," Buglewicz says. "The courseload, in particular the 
exhaustive lab work, makes them wonderful thinkers and troubleshooters."</P> 
<P>	Gary Nuzzi, a 1983 graduate, says the lab work helped him and 1963 graduate 
Bill Blethen develop a revolutionary lighting system that won an Academy Award for 
technical achievement last year. The portable strobe light allows movie cameras to 
capture detail at high speed. "The education was, at times, very challenging, but very 
practical," Nuzzi adds.</P> 

<H3>The Bottom Line</H3>
<P>	Most remarkable, however, is that DeVry makes a profit. By defining its mission 
narrowly, the school has perfected its product and minimized waste. DeVry's cost-saving 
efforts are immediately evident. There are no ivy-laden academic halls or rolling greens. 
Rather, each DeVry campus holds its classes in an office building that is usually 
surrounded by a parking lot. In such a modern facility, little space is wasted, maintenance 
costs are moderate, and classrooms can accommodate professors from various 
departments. And the school runs three cycles of classes--morning, afternoon, and 
evening--to use the space more efficiently. The institute does not own any dormitories. 
Instead, DeVry leases housing near its campuses from local landlords and sublets it to the 
students at a modest profit.</P>
<P>	DeVry also holds down costs by maintaining a narrow academic focus. DeVry 
does not fund any sports teams or clubs that are not directly related to job placement; on 
some campuses, students independently run intramural leagues by securing outside 
sponsors. "We are not trying to be all things to all people," says Kathy Perdue, head of 
the accounting department at the Atlanta campus. "We figured out what we do best, 
concentrating on the academics to get jobs, not filling social needs."</P>
<P>	The school does not grant tenure to any of its professors, allowing it to respond 
quickly to fluctuating enrollments. Moreover, DeVry is not a research or publishing 
institution, so faculty members carry teaching loads two to three times that of other 
college professors. Finally, since the school operates at full capacity, even in the 
summers, professors are expected to work as they would in private industry: year-round.
<P>	DeVry maximizes tuition revenue by actively recruiting students through 
television and newspaper advertising, direct mail, and recruiters. A traveling sales force 
of 200 visits high schools and Army bases throughout North America, while another 100 
salespeople respond to applicants who call DeVry in response to advertising. DeVry's 
$15-million advertising campaign promotes its focus on careers, profiling graduates with 
senior positions in prominent companies like Coca-Cola.</P>
<P>	The individual cost-saving measures add up. The price tag of a DeVry education 
is $6,015 for two semesters, or $26,730 for the complete degree. By comparison, a four-
year degree at public, non-research universities in the same states where DeVry operates 
costs much more in tuition and taxpayer subsidies: $40,148 in California, for instance, 
and $35,440 in Georgia.</P>
<P>	As an accredited school, DeVry participates in all the same financial aid programs 
as public schools. DeVry's loan default rate is 17 percent--better than many for-profit 
trade schools and far below the government's intervention zone of 25 to 30 percent. 
Industry analysts note that the institute's job placement record and bachelor's degree 
program distinguishes it from trade schools.</P>
<P>	For-profit schools such as DeVry are a model for the future of university 
education. As more adults return to school later in life, they will find they prefer the no-
nonsense DeVry degree, which can be finished in three years. Currently the average age 
of DeVry students is 26. In addition, the number of high-school graduates is expected to 
keep rising through 2013. Combine that statistic with downsizing in the military, for-
profit education's top rival for high-school graduates, and DeVry seems to enjoy a rosy 
outlook. In fact, the results are already beginning to show: Enrollment was up 4 percent 
this year, and the company added two new campuses. "Frankly, the demand is growing 
quicker than our ability to supply it," says Norman Levine, DeVry's chief financial 
officer. And two other for-profit college-education companies announced initial public 
offerings this year.</P>
<P>	Despite DeVry's proven track record in securing jobs for working-class students, 
bureaucrats may prevent the school from expanding. In New York City, for example, the 
state's department of education has not yet approved DeVry's 1993 accreditation 
application. Once the department okays the school's academic standards, government 
analysts will determine DeVry's impact on established local schools. Every college in 
New York City will be invited to comment on DeVry's entrance into the market. If area 
schools fear DeVry will steal students from their tuition rolls, they can urge the 
department to reject the application. The Education Department's Bureau of Planning will 
also analyze whether the local job market can accommodate the future DeVry graduates. 
Department officials note that, due to understaffing, it normally takes several years for a 
school's 300-page application to be approved.</P>
<P>	Even skeptics of for-profit education concede that public schools and private non-
profits are unable to expand to meet the growing demand. Public universities would 
require greater tax subsidies to support a larger student base, and private non-profits 
would have to raise even more through alumni giving. "Time and time again, we have 
seen that the healthiest and best systems in the world involve private enterprise 
competing," says Keller. "We're the future of education."</P>

We must restore a balance between citizen and police responsibilities, [for] effective social control cannot possibly be achieved by hired hands alone.
</blockquote><p>

-- Herman Goldstein, <i>Policing a Free Society
</i><p>
	Americans live in fear. We live in the most criminally violent times in our nation's history. The level of street crime is between three and four times what it was in 1960, and the rate of violent crimes quadrupled between 1966 and 1990. People no longer feel safe walking to the corner store or letting their kids bike to the local park.
<p>	In healthy communities, individuals establish and enforce codes of conduct, both formal and informal. Litterers get a lecture. Speeders get yelled at. Unruly youths get a tongue-lashing. But in unhealthy communities, the fear of crime keeps people shut up in their homes (especially the elderly), cuts off commercial activity, alienates individuals from each other, and surrenders the streets to the very kind of disorderly activity that fuels crime in the first place. Community is eroded, and because individuals are afraid to maintain order, the community loses its lawful environment.
<p>	Until neighborhoods are safe again, they will not thrive economically or socially. Waiting for the government to make it all better is a losing strategy. People have to become more involved in ensuring their own security.
<p>	It is said that for every complex problem, there is a simple and elegant solution that is wrong. For crime, the simple answer is, "We need more cops and we need more prisons." Though extremely popular right now with politicians, this approach will ultimately do little to improve public safety. The best police force in the world cannot make safe a community in which people have no regard for the lives or property of others. Without question, swift and sure punishment of criminal activity is an important component of an effective crime policy. But the best defense against crime is not a thin, blue line, but a community of individuals respectful of others. 
<p>	There is a great deal that the government can and should do to improve public safety, but first it must recognize that it needs help. Restoring public safety demands a renewed partnership between the police and the community. Police must reacquaint themselves with the people in the communities they serve, and communities must recognize that the brunt of the task of policing a free society does not lie with the police, but with citizens themselves.
<p>
<b>Community Policing</b><p>
	From the time of America's founding, law enforcement has had a strong neighborhood foundation. In the early years of the Republic, male citizens in large U.S. cities were required to stand watch at night with no pay. Throughout most of America's history, in fact, citizens were expected to police their communities themselves -- at least part time -- as they went about their daily lives. The job of police officers was to support the community in keeping the peace.
<p>	Alexis de Tocqueville, who was particularly impressed by this, wrote, "In America, the means available to the authorities for the discovery of crimes and arrest of criminals are few. . . . Nevertheless, I doubt whether in any other country crime so seldom escapes punishment. . . . During my stay in the United States I have seen the inhabitants of a country where a serious crime had been committed spontaneously forming committees with the object of catching the criminal and handing him over to the courts. In Europe the criminal is a luckless man fighting to save his head from the authorities. In America he is an enemy of the human race and every human being is against him."
<p>	Direct community involvement doesn't mean vigilantes stringing up violators. Urban anthropologist Jane Jacobs explains, "The first thing to understand is that the public space -- the sidewalk and street peace -- of cities is not kept primarily by the police, necessary as police are. Rather, it is kept by an intricate, almost unconscious, network of voluntary controls and standards established and enforced by the people themselves."
<p>	Except in extremely small geographic areas, it is not economically possible to put a cop on every corner. No police department is large enough -- nor should it be -- to serve as an occupying army. A community must police itself. There is no way that New York City's 37,000 police officers can control the city's 7.5 million residents. The police are there to help. For much of America's history, this was understood.
<p>	In the 1960s, however, the public began to forget its role in controlling crime and grew increasingly dependent on the police. Police departments became more professionalized and shifted their primary mission from peacekeeping to crime fighting. Rather than regular beats, foot patrols, and informal pressure on the unruly, police forces increasingly used motorized patrols, radio dispatch, and rapid response as their main tools. In the terminology of television culture, the "Andy of Mayberry" model was replaced by the "One-Adam-Twelve" approach. 
<p>	Americans began to think of crimefighting as the job of police. The riots of the 1960s showed in violent detail how America's historic partnership between police and community had broken down. Police officers -- often in squad cars or behind desks at headquarters -- were spending more time with other officers than with citizens. The new policing methods had the effect of divorcing them from the community. The divorce was mutual: Many communities stopped policing themselves. <p>
	This alienation left everyone worse off. Americans are more dissatisfied with their police departments than ever before, and the police are straining under the weight of massive problems they are powerless to handle alone. 
<p>	Swift and sure punishment for criminals is important, but we shouldn't fool ourselves into thinking that the courts can make us safe, any more than the police can. We will never really get a hold on crime in America until we move back to a society where kids in trouble can be turned around before they get in more trouble and are sent away to prisons to become hardened criminals. "The total impacts [of public policy on crime] are not going to be that great in a free society," says James Q. Wilson. "A free society depends on the conscience and reputations of individuals and the social norms of communities to maintain order. That is what has collapsed in America."
<p>	To use an analogy from the manufacturing world, we can't afford to depend on an outside referee to detect and fix the defective products of our society; far better to create a system that isn't producing so many defects in the first place. From this perspective, product quality is no longer the exclusive responsibility of the inspectors in the quality department; rather, it's everyone's concern. Families come first, police and courts follow.
<p>	With its emphasis on crime prevention, community policing can be a part of the total picture. "We currently see ourselves as feeding the criminal-justice system," says police chief Daryl Stephens of St. Petersburg, Florida. "What if we saw our primary responsibility as starving it?"
<P>	At its heart, neighborhood policing recreates the partnership between the police and the community. In essence, the police tell the community, "We will help you do your job." Variations of the idea are being introduced all over the country, from Jacksonville to Madison to Seattle.
<p>	For community policing to work, the neighborhoods have to be willing to help themselves. Explains San Diego police officer Jim Coleman, "It is not the teacher's fault, it's not the police officer's fault, it's not the court's fault. The community has to recognize it has a responsibility for governing its own value standards. . . . People choose the way they want to live, and police can't remove that responsibility. The police can't come in and restore order if the community doesn't raise its own value standard."
<p>	San Diego has led the nation in embracing a partnership with neighborhood groups, citizen patrols, and volunteer "officers" (see <a href="#sandiego">sidebar</a>). To be sure, in America's toughest communities, where neighborhood control has been overrun by gangs, drug dealers, and a general sense of lawlessness, community policing of the San Diego model may not be enough. Community policing works best in the communities still controlled by law-abiding residents, not criminals. In the neighborhoods where criminals now hold sway, cops will be needed to help law-abiding citizens -- a majority in even the worst inner-city neighborhoods -- regain control and come out from behind their locked doors to augment the police presence. In the long run, however, community members themselves must take responsibility for making their neighborhoods unfriendly to criminals.
<p>
<b>Street Patrols
</b><p>	A key component of community policing is getting more cops back on the neighborhood beat. "Beat integrity," the practice of charging a small group of officers with responsibility for a small area, has hardly been seen since the 1950s. Patrols can be conducted on foot, on bike, in a car, or some combination of these. The beat system increases the connection between law-abiding citizens and the police and gives citizens opportunities to express their concerns. 
<p>	This sense of connection is evident in the community policing of officer Mike Elder, whose beat for the last two years has been a three-square-mile, lower-middle-class area on Indianapolis's south side. Elder's beat includes numerous vacant lots, some boarded-up buildings, and two of the city's worst public-housing projects. As in many cities, Indianapolis's urban sprawl makes it impractical for Elder to patrol his entire beat on foot. However, he makes up for this by spending a good part of each day walking around the housing projects and the neighborhood parks, checking in with store owners, and maintaining open office hours at his field office in the Clearstream housing project.<p>
	Elder is a reassuring presence to public-housing residents tired of living in fear. Before Elder set up shop at Clearstream, says one resident, "there would be gunfights in the project in the middle of the street in broad daylight." Another Clearstream resident, a single mother, says, "Before Mike came in, I wouldn't dare let my kids play outdoors because of the shootings and drug deals going down at all hours of the day and night. People living in projects want a normal life, too -- and we're getting there." After Elder started his beat, the number of service calls from the Clearstream projects to the police dropped from 1,500 in 1991 to 550 in 1993.<p>
	With an intense awareness of the neighborhood, community-based officers can stop crimes before they happen. The officer on the beat hears gossip from casual, informal contact with people. Elder knows most of the residents at his two housing projects. He can count on a dozen or so residents in each project to keep him informed of impending trouble by calling him on his beeper. If any drug dealing is taking place or any strangers are causing trouble, he'll know within a day.
<p>	Assigning officers to regular beats and emphasizing problem-solving can also prompt residents of troubled minority areas to look more favorably on the men and women in blue. Before Elder was assigned to their beat, residents of Clearstream didn't much trust the police. Residents only saw cops when they were responding to incidents, and viewed them as outsiders. With steady contact, Elder has built a relationship of trust. "If we tried to take Elder out of that beat, the residents would be marching on city hall within hours," jokes Michael Beaver, Indianapolis's director of public safety.
<p>	Most cops loathe beat patrols. Many police officers -- particularly those in middle management -- would prefer the safety of their desk jobs over venturing out onto the streets. Hitting the pavement is seen as a demotion by veteran cops, many of whom have worked hard to get off the beat and win an assignment to a specialty unit or to administrative work. 
<p>	Jersey City Mayor Bret Schundler learned the hard way that the opposition to community policing can be intense. When he was elected in 1992, just one cop worked foot patrol in Jersey City; Schundler wanted 300. The force hardly embraced the idea. "Comfortable jobs in all city departments were given as a reward for political service and loyalty," wrote Schundler in <i>Policy Review</i> (Summer 1994). "The patronage system has made assignments to street patrol intolerable."<p>
	The new mayor found himself battling with Jersey City's police union. When Schundler learned that two police officers spent their days delivering interoffice mail, he had them reassigned to street patrol. The police union filed a lawsuit to prevent the move, citing a contract clause that states: "Police work cannot be diminished except through contract negotiation." Like most people, Schundler can't understand how having officers patrol the street diminishes police work. He is fighting the suit.
<p>	Schundler cites union contracts -- supported by state arbitration rules -- as his biggest barrier to successful policing. "Our crime problem is not the result of our spending too little on policing," he says, "but rather of our getting too little policing for our money -- and the root cause of this problem is non-local government interference in police department management."
<p>
<b>Combating Disorder
</b>

<p>	Many urban areas are marked by evidence of physical decay: boarded-up buildings, vacant lots strewn with litter, and graffiti-covered walls. This sense of community despair creates an aura of lawlessness that encourages criminal behavior.
<p>	In a 1982 <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> article titled "Broken Windows," James Q. Wilson and George Kelling argued that disorder in a community, if left uncorrected, undercuts residents' own efforts to maintain their homes and neighborhoods and control unruly behavior. "If a window in a building is broken and left unrepaired," they wrote, "all the rest of the windows will soon be broken. . . . One unrepaired window is a signal that no one cares, so breaking more windows costs nothing. . . . Untended property becomes fair game for people out for fun or plunder."
<p>	If disorder goes unchecked, a vicious cycle begins. First, it kindles a fear of crime among residents, who respond by staying behind locked doors. Their involvement in the neighborhood declines; people begin to ignore rowdy and threatening behavior in public. They cease to exercise social regulation over little things like litter on the street, loitering strangers, or truant schoolchildren. When law-abiding eyes stop watching the streets, the social order breaks down and criminals move in.
<p>	"Stable neighborhoods can change in a few months to jungles," declare Wilson and Kelling. Disorder also can have dire economic consequences. Shoppers will shun an area they perceive as being "out of control." One study analyzing crime in 30 different areas found that the level of disorder of a neighborhood -- more than such factors as income level, resident turnover, or racial makeup -- was the best indicator of an area's lack of safety.
<p>	For decades, most big-city police departments have devoted little effort to combating disorder. By allowing an accumulation of small infractions, this neglect creates an environment that generates big infractions.
<p>	The community-policing movement is beginning to change this. Community policing emphasizes giving neighborhoods a greater say in determining police priorities, a surefire way to bringing issues of physical and social disorder to the top of the police agenda. An important part of a community patrol officer's job is enforcing a community's norms of tolerable behavior and order. Beat officers can't impose their personal rules on a community, but they can help a community maintain its own standards. "You have to be given the latitude to enforce the laws in different ways in different communities," says Indianapolis's Elder.
<p>	Although calls for order maintenance have historically been associated mostly with white middle- and upper-class neighborhoods, today some of the loudest voices are coming from poor minority communities. Says Ace Backus, a Milwaukee community organizer, "In the nice white communities don't be drunk on the street, don't be throwing down litter, the cops will stop you. In the middle of the black ghetto you can do that and the police will drive past. It's reverse discrimination."
<p>
<b>Problems, Not Symptoms 
</b>

<p>	Conventional policing is incident-driven: A citizen calls 911 to report a crime and then the police show up. Much of the time, all officers can do at this point is take a report. By reacting to crime rather than trying to prevent crime, police treat only the symptoms, not the root causes of problems. The key to improving New York's subway was the emphasis on preemptive problem solving, an example of what policing experts refer to as "problem-oriented policing" (see <a href="#subway">sidebar</a>).
<P>	Former San Diego Police Chief Bob Burgreen frames the issue this way: "Random patrol duty is little better than sleeping on duty."
<p>	In one large city, for example, a trucking company had 32 trailers burglarized in less than 18 months. A predictable routine developed: The owner would report the crime, the police would visit the yard, take a statement, and then wait for the next call from the owner. In desperation, the owner finally threatened to move his $13-million company out of the city unless something was done to stop the stream of break-ins. 
<p>	This prompted the police department to abandon business as usual. An outside consultant was brought in, and police soon determined that the physical layout of the trucking yard was encouraging the break-ins. The officers talked the owner into improving the lighting and raising the fence. Police then worked with other city agencies to erect a barricade between the truck yard and the adjacent vacant city property that was being used as an escape route. Problem solved.
<p>	Some level of problem-solving occurs in every police department, but it is typically done in a haphazard fashion. San Diego is alone in making problem-solving a focal point of each police officer's daily duties. Because it depends on identifying recurring patterns of disruptive activity, problem-oriented policing depends on good information. 
<p>	San Diego's crime analysis unit has set up a sophisticated computer tracking system that officers can tap into to get information on 60 types of problems, previous attempts to solve specific problems, and recurrent problems in different geographical areas. While problem-solving gives police officers some tools and the analytical framework for approaching community safety problems, community involvement is still a key component. "There are no long-term solutions to problems unless the community is involved," says Nancy McPherson, formerly the city's neighborhood-policing coordinator.
<p>	As already noted, people tend to equate the frequency of crime in an area with how the external environment "looks" and "feels." Visible disorder sends warning signals to our brains of impending danger. Disorder is a sign that the social mechanisms of control that characterize healthy neighborhoods have broken down, which in turn encourages lawlessness. To build safer neighborhoods, individuals and communities must exercise control of the physical environment in which they live. 
<p>
<b>Empowering Landlords
</b><p>

 	Police officers appreciate the role that landlords can play in keeping a neighborhood strong and safe. Historically, landlords in low-income, working-class neighborhoods adhered to the neighborhood's set of norms and refused to rent to individuals who, in the landlord's judgment, would not be a positive force in the neighborhood. This is because landlords, for economic reasons, desire essentially the same thing as neighbors do for social reasons: responsible and conscientious tenants who will respect the property of others.
<p>	In recent years, government regulations, civil-rights laws, and court rulings have made it almost impossible for landlords to turn away dubious renters or to evict destructive tenants from their apartments. The unintended consequence? Many working-class neighborhoods have been ripped apart by rental units that become crack houses.
<p>	Giving homeowners control of their property can help reduce crime. Almost by accident, the city of Milwaukee came up with a simple yet effective way for government to assist, instead of frustrate, landlords who want to maintain neighborhood norms. Marty Collins, a 15-year city employee, was looking for a way to improve the city's drug-addiction prevention program. Knowing that most drug dealing in Milwaukee occurred out of rental properties, Collins reasoned that the only people that really could control the situation are the landlords. 
<p>	Collins surveyed Milwaukee landlords and found that 70 percent of them reported having had destructive tenants at one time or another, yet virtually no landlords were using tenant screening techniques. Why not? "For fear of getting their butts sued," says Collins. Milwaukee's landlords were largely unaware that legal methods were available to enable them to discriminate against prospective tenants with destructive histories. By taking simple precautions, such as requiring favorable recommendations from previous owners, running a credit check, and visiting the current home of prospective renters, homeowners can eliminate the bad apples and help keep their neighborhoods safe.
<p>	Most landlords were also unaware of three Milwaukee companies that provide a listing of all tenants who have been previously evicted from rental properties. Milwaukee now informs all landlords how to be more discriminating.
<p>	While Milwaukee deserves credit for giving landlords the legal leverage they need to protect their property, the city sometimes goes too far in holding landlords responsible for the actions of their tenants. If police receive two complaints about drug dealing at a rented property, Milwaukee undercover police will attempt a drug buy. If successful, the city sends a notice to the landlord instructing him or her to take actions to stop the property from being used for drug dealing. If the problem persists, the city takes the landlord to court and can ask for the property to be forfeited. 
<p>	In essence, Milwaukee is asking the landlord to control their tenants' behavior or risk losing their property. Empowering landlords by allowing them to choose to whom they will and will not rent is one thing. Asking them to be responsible for the actions of their renters is quite another. Providing landlords with the legal assistance to screen and evict disruptive tenants is a step in the right direction, but we shouldn't expect landlords to act as chaperones for their tenants.
<p>	This trend toward relying on landlords to discipline tenants is ironic, for in many cases the most irresponsible landlord of all is the government. Much of the worst crime in America takes place in or around government housing projects. When Reuben Greenberg became the police chief of Charleston, South Carolina, in 1982, he thought it ludicrous that the government routinely rented units to the lowliest criminals of society. "No other landlord has to rent to child molesters, robbers, rapists, and arsonists. Why should people in public housing have to live with them?" asked Greenberg.
<p>	Working with city housing authorities, Greenberg set out to make the city's public housing the last place criminals would dare to set up shop. Prospective tenants were screened for criminal records. Tenants who engaged in illegal behavior were swiftly evicted. Through mostly common-sense measures that any sensible landlord would take, Charleston's public housing projects are now "the safest places to live in Charleston," says department spokesman Charles Francis.
<p>
<b>Closing off Streets</b>
<p>	Americans like to control their space. With their long driveways, high walls, and security systems, wealthier neighborhoods have never been known for their accessibility to outsiders. Wealthy city-dwellers have "doormen" that provide security for their apartment buildings. Middle-class suburbs have their own ways of discouraging strangers, including myriad cul-de-sacs and white picket fences. Residential community associations (RCAs) have taken the concept of designing for safety one step further. The typical RCA has walls, gates, cul-de-sacs, security systems, and an endless series of speed bumps. 
<p> 	In contrast, poor city neighborhoods are typically laid out in a grid format. "By allowing for lots of through traffic, grids compromise a neighborhood's integrity," says Judy Butler, the city of Houston's neighborhood coordinator. The grid format, while pleasing to city traffic engineers, makes neighborhoods susceptible to drive-by shootings and random through-traffic. 
<p> 	While some criticize the suburbs and RCAs for having a "fortress mentality," these communities provide residents with the security they desire, providing physical barriers that give people greater control over their living environment. These barriers not only keep strangers out, they mark the physical boundaries that define communities.
<p>	"Why not try to redesign the urban area to recapture the quality of life in the suburbs?" asks Oscar Newman, a city planner and architect. Newman is the country's leading expert on and proponent of creating "defensible space" in urban neighborhoods by closing off streets. Street closures, Newman has found, give residents greater control over the security of their neighborhood. Closures also broadcast a distinct message to potential criminals: This community is profoundly serious about deterring crime and anti-social behavior.
<p>	St. Louis has a long tradition of street closures. Beginning in the late 19th century, many streets in the wealthiest neighborhoods were deeded to residents instead of the city. Each of the streets was represented by an association that often also owned the sewers and water mains. At the time, St. Louis had shoddy public services, so the private streets were a way of attracting homebuyers by assuring them of reliable services such as water supply and street lighting.
<p>	In the 1950s, St. Louis was in decline. Crime was rising, property values were falling, and much of the middle class was fleeing to the safer and cleaner suburbs. Left behind were poorer residents, less likely to be homeowners and more likely to be transient. To stop the flight of middle-class homeowners out of the city, the city began to revive its private street program. Neighborhoods of all income levels were allowed and encouraged to petition the city to convert their public streets to private ownership. Many middle-class neighborhoods took the city's offer: They formed homeowner associations, put up gates, and assumed the costs and responsibilities of maintaining the streets themselves. 
<p>	Since the mid-1970s, more than 1,000 St. Louis streets have been closed off and privatized. By making these neighborhoods more distinct, street closures have made it easier to identify intruders and keep out unwanted visitors. The result: lower crime rates and higher property values compared to adjacent neighborhoods, according to Newman. It also has made the neighborhoods more cohesive, as they become safe places for children to play and conduits for social activity. "With traffic flow limited to an occasional moving car, the street has become an extension of the front yards of the abutting houses: an area where children play and adults can meet and socialize," writes Newman. Street closures can restore the balance between mobility for cars and livability for residents. 
<p>	Until recently, St. Louis was about the only city that made use of street closures in urban settings. But the increasing levels of crime, gang activity, and drive-by shootings throughout urban America are prompting other cities to experiment with street closures. Cities as diverse as Dallas, Chicago, Houston, Dayton, and Fort Lauderdale are aggressively closing off streets. Though St. Louis is unique in allowing a transfer of ownership to residents, these urban enclaves are proving an effective way for a community to regain control of its environment.
<p>	Dayton, Ohio, is home to one of the country's most ambitious street-closure experiments. Like many aging urban communities, Five Oaks, an integrated, lower-middle-class neighborhood in Dayton, found itself in decline. Homeowners were leaving, rental properties were poorly maintained, and drug dealers and prostitutes had set up shop. Located near the freeway, Five Oaks was an ideal location for crack houses. Experts predicted that within two years much of the neighborhood would be a disaster area.
<p>	In 1992, desperate neighborhood leaders turned to street closures. The city called in Oscar Newman to assist. A year later, 34 streets and 26 alleys were closed off in Five Oaks. Neighborhood residents divided Five Oaks into ten mini-neighborhoods to enable law-abiding residents to confront the problems in their immediate area.
<p>	Only a year after the streets were closed, substantial improvement was visible. Cut-through traffic, previously a big problem in the neighborhood, fell by two-thirds. Automobile accidents and traffic speed levels also declined dramatically. After dropping the previous two years, housing sales surged 55 percent, while the average purchase price of a home increased 15 percent. Violent crime was cut in half; overall crime plunged by 26 percent. Most importantly, Five Oaks residents felt much safer and in control of their immediate surroundings. "I have four little kids," said one neighborhood homeowner. "My kids can now play out in the yard. It's been a blessing for my family."
<p>
<b>Reclaiming Public Parks</b> 
<p>	Another problem of "space" in many cities (and some suburbs too) are local parks. Instead of serving as a place for kids to play and families to picnic, many parks have become gathering places for gangs and drug dealers. Instead of serving as a common area that knits the community together, many neighborhood parks are tearing communities apart. 
<p>	City officials refer to such parks as "orphan" parks because there is no real or perceived "ownership" of the park, and so no one takes care of it. City hall cannot possibly provide the same level of attention as the people who use the park every day. Local involvement is needed to make small parks a positive force in the neighborhood; only neighborhood residents, the people who use the park, can provide this. 
<p>	The inspiring story of San Antonio's Lee's Creek Park proves the point. "It's not every 41-year old that can leave a legacy for his children," says San Antonian Bill Lucas as he looks over the plans for Lee's Creek Park, a project that engrossed him for over a year. Lucas does not work for the city planning or recreation department -- he is a sales manager for Bekins Moving Systems. <p>
	Donated by the Lee family to the city, the park is located in a declining area of the city with swelling gang problems. After 10 years, it was still little more than a vacant lot. Then along came Bill Lucas and the local chapter of Optimist Club International, the 75-year-old "friends of youth" organization. In conjunction with around 35 neighborhood families, the Optimist Club transformed the weed-infested vacant lot into a thriving community parkwithout the aid of taxpayer money. Creating Lee's Creek Park was a true volunteer effort. A bridge over the creek was a gift from an Optimist Club member in memory of his wife. A running track was donated by a construction company. The sweat to clear the lot and plant the trees was contributed by neighborhood residents and even some nonresidents, including Mrs. Lee herself. "All we are doing is recreating in a small way neighborhood involvement like it was in the 1800s in America when people used to pitch in and help build their neighbors' houses and barns," says Lucas.<p>
	When the park was finished it was turned back over to the city, which agreed to maintain it. Lucas is confident the park will not fall victim to "orphan park" syndrome. "Our idea is for the neighbors to create ownership opportunities for themselves," he said. To do so, ownership committees were created and vested with control of certain blocked out sections of the park that they are responsible for beautifying and maintaining. The sense of ownership is critical. "If the park were given to us we wouldn't respect it," says Lucas. "We can see it in our own children. Make them earn it, and they own it." 
<p>	Turning over partial ownership or management of city parks to nonprofit groups and neighborhood associations is often the best way to ensure they remain a public asset. New York City's Neighborhood Open Space Coalition has assumed control of hundreds of abandoned lots and parks in this way, turning many dangerous eyesores into gardens. Nearly one-fourth of the city's nearly 1,500 public parks are now cared for by community associations under the Operation Green Thumb program.
<p>	Private groups usually have more success ensuring the park is in constant use, which is the key to keeping a park safe. The nonprofit Central Park Conservancy has raised more than $100 million for New York City's Central Park since its founding in 1980. It has taken over the care of trees, lawns, and plants and provides more than half of the park's operating costs. By 1989, 72 percent of Central Park users said the park felt safer after the conservancy got involved. Crime dropped 59 percent and robberies plummeted 73 percent. The drop in crime is attributed to the large increase in park activities put on by the conservancy. Good uses drove out the bad uses.
<p>
<b>Crisis Point</b> 
<p>	What is the future of public safety in America? One possibility is that we will continue to ask police to attempt the impossible: To create safe communities without the communities' help. Under this scenario, there will be more cops, more prisons -- and more crime.
<p>	The other possibility is more appealing. We can learn from America's most innovative public-safety models -- San Diego's problem-oriented, neighborhood policing; New York's subway-disorder reduction; Milwaukee's landlord empowerment policies; and Dayton's Five Oaks street closures -- to develop a new vision of policing America's neighborhoods and downtowns where police departments are closer to the communities they serve and citizens and communities take a more active role in protecting their safety. 
<p>	Under this scenario, America could see a future with fewer police and more security. We are fast approaching a crisis point in our country as crime and fear of crime paralyze our nation. How we respond will go a long way in determining what we become as a nation.

<a name="sandiego"></a><b>San Diego's Trailblazing Example (sidebar)</b>

<p>	Community policing demands that both police and citizens accept responsibilities. The community's contribution can take many forms, from setting up community watches and getting landlords to screen potential renters to cleaning up vacant lots, reporting suspicious behavior, and making sure teenagers don't roam the streets. If citizens don't take responsibility for the safety of their own community, the police can do little to help. 
<p>	San Diego's bold effort to involve citizens in public safety is unheard of among big cities. One San Diego official related this story: "I told a group of our officers that we were planning to have civilian volunteers take crime reports and collect evidence in cases of petty thefts. About three-quarters of them were nodding their heads, saying, 'Yeah, that makes sense.' If I tried that in New York or Chicago, they'd laugh me out of the room."
<p>	At San Diego's Eastern Division police headquarters, a group gathers around a conference table regularly to discuss better ways to patrol a certain neighborhood. But these blue-shirted peacekeepers aren't police officers. They are gray-haired volunteers of the Retired Senior Volunteer Patrol (RSVP), a major component of San Diego's commitment to neighborhood policing. 
<p>	"The partnership between the community and our department really works," says police captain Dan Berglund. In addition to 272 sworn officers, Berglund's division relies on 115 senior volunteers, 20 reserves, and 40 other resident volunteers. "Their influence in their own community has been extremely beneficial," says Berglund. 
<p>	Neighborhood policing requires a fundamental change in the department's operating philosophy. The police shift their attention from rapid response to putting more officers out on regular beats, where they can help the community solve public-safety problems. Neighborhood policing also entails much greater use of volunteers and soliciting the concerns of the citizens. In the language of Tom Peters, neighborhood policing means "getting close to the customer." 
<p>	San Diego uses volunteers in a wide range of nonconfrontational situations, such as towing cars, collecting evidence (including fingerprinting), and checking on the homes of absent neighbors. Instead of assigning a uniformed officer to spend, say, 45 minutes writing a report for a petty theft, San Diego uses volunteers trained at the police academy. This frees up officers for problems that require their special skills. "So long as volunteers are given meaningful work, and welcomed as a partner in the process, I will have an unlimited number of people in any community in this city to do that," Berglund said. 
<p>	The SDPD is unusual in its openness to citizen input and volunteer assistance. Admittedly, San Diego is blessed with many retirees. Although it's the sixth-largest city in America, San Diego's police force has a small-town feel. In most big cities, powerful police unions would oppose the use of community volunteers for police work. But San Diego welcomes them. 
<p>	This tolerant culture, which took years to develop, is due partly to Police Chief Jerry Sanders's deep commitment to community policing. San Diego is the first large city to adopt a department-wide approach to community policing. Nearly every SDPD police officer belongs to a team assigned to a discrete geographical area and charged with developing a close relationship with that neighborhood. "We are using persuasion rather than coercion to get people on board," says Nancy McPherson, who served as San Diego's neighborhood-policing coordinator before moving on to the Seattle police department.
<P>	Police departments customarily resist community policing because cops fear they will become social workers rather than crimefighters. The department dispelled that idea early on. After getting to know the residents on their beat, two San Diego cops trained in neighborhood problem-solving learned that a gang had taken over a particular section of an apartment complex. Through close relations with the building's law-abiding residents, they gathered the evidence needed to obtain search warrants. The bust that followed -- complete with SWAT teams and swarms of patrol cars -- put an end to the worry that neighborhood policing was soft on crime.

<p>

<a name="subway"></a><b>New York City's Subway (sidebar)</b><p>

	For years litter, graffiti, vagrants, and panhandlers had been turning New York City's subway into a vaguely sinister netherworld. The transit agency's first reaction to this problem was standard public-sector misjudgment: Add more "inputs." Additional police officers were assigned to patrol the transit system. The results were unimpressive, and riders remained frightened.
<p>	In the mid-1980s, David Gunn, the new transit authority president, decided to wage a war on the graffiti that covered nearly every square foot of every city subway car. Vast amounts of time and money had already been invested in increasing patrols and surveillance to reduce graffiti -- to no avail. Regardless of how many "taggers" were caught, there were always more. The overburdened courts never gave taggers more than stern lectures.<p>
	A deeper analysis of the graffiti problem revealed that taggers got a thrill from viewing their markings on future trips. Denied the satisfaction of beholding their "art," Gunn figured, many taggers would simply stop. He made the removal of graffiti from subway cars a top priority. The strategy worked. On May 12, 1989, five years after the launch of the Clean Car Program, the last of the graffiti-covered cars was removed from service. The Big Apple's notorious subway cars were among the cleanest in the world.<p>
	But removing the graffiti only solved part of the problem. New Yorkers still feared the disorderly people who always seemed to be hanging around the subway.
<p>	In 1990, the city hired William Bratton (now the city's police commissioner) as the new chief of transit police. "We understood early on that the problems of crime, disorder, and fare evasion were deeply interrelated," Bratton says, "and that therefore we would have to form a coherent strategy to deal with them." Bratton discovered that fare-jumpers not only cost the transit system more than $120 million a year in income, but also committed much of the crime and unruly behavior in the subway. He organized plainclothes "sweep teams" of four to six officers to catch fare-evaders. Says Bratton, "The sweeps produced some interesting results. One of every six fare-evaders we stopped either was carrying a weapon or was wanted for another crime on an outstanding warrant. That was an incredibly high statistic, and it made us realize that by fighting fare evasion, we were also making an impact on crime."
<p>	At the same time, Bratton set out to reduce the intimidating behavior of panhandlers and homeless people in the subways. Monthly ejections from the subway went from 2,000 to 16,000. In Bratton's first two years, the number of felonies in the subway fell 30 percent.

"The flat tax has some serious hurdles to overcome<br> 
before it can go from tax concept to tax code."</i><br>
-- J.D. Foster<br>
</center>
<hr>
<p>
<br>
The flat tax is the vanguard of tax reform, and for good reason. It is  
sound economically and easy to explain. It corrects some long-standing  
problems with the current tax system: complexity, high costs of  
administration and compliance, a depressing effect on the economy, and  
the unfairness of double taxation of income from capital. Its strengths  
have gained the flat tax many ardent fans and have brought it from an  
obscure oddity debated by economists to the forefront of the tax-policy  
debate.   
<p> 	  
Flat-tax advocates are nearly evangelistic in their drive to replace the  
current tax system, often as an integral part of their broader agenda to  
reshape government. They are also often unwilling to acknowledge that,  
despite its strengths, the flat tax also has some weaknesses and some  
serious obstacles to overcome before it can go from tax concept to tax  
code.   
<p>
<center>
<b><a name="Flat Tax">WHAT IS A FLAT TAX?</a></b><br>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
Any tax with a single tax rate could be considered a flat tax. A flat tax on  
labor and business income has been popularized by professors Robert E.  
Hall and Alvin Rabushka of the Hoover Institution. A flat tax on labor  
and business income is also embodied in legislative proposals advanced  
by Congressman Dick Armey, the majority leader in the House of  
Representatives, and Senator Arlen Specter, a presidential contender.  
These flat-tax proposals do not tax income from saving; they are  
therefore a form of consumption tax.  
<p> 	  
One of the great advantages of a flat tax is its neutrality. It taxes all forms  
of income only once and does so at a single rate. It taxes individuals'  
labor income at a single rate after allowing for personal exemptions, and  
it taxes business's net cash flow at the same rate that applies to  
individuals. The flat tax thus gives no relative advantage to any means of  
earning income. It favors neither capital nor labor, neither physical nor  
intellectual capital, neither manufacturing nor real estate. By contrast,  
under current law, the federal government uses the tax code to  
micromanage the economy, distorting the allocation of resources such as   
capital and labor, and thereby diminishing both the level of economic  
activity and the standard of living.  
<p>	  
The flat tax is also vastly simpler than the current system and thus  
virtually transparent to taxpayers -- that is, taxpayers need not become  
lawyers or CPAs to understand the intent and application of the tax  
system. Such transparency is important for individuals and businesses   
making economic decisions, for taxpayers' confidence in the fairness of  
the system, and for assuring taxpayers that the tax code will not become a  
tool of deliberate or accidental oppression by government. Much of the  
distrust bred by the federal tax system derives from a suspicion that it  
conceals traps to snare the unwary taxpayer and torture him with tax  
penalties, interest charges, tax liens, and possibly jail. The flat tax aims to  
be so simple and transparent that taxpayers could shelve their fear of the  
tax man.  
<p>	  
<b>Individuals under a flat tax.</b> Taxable income under a flat tax includes all  
wages and salary, and excludes all capital income such as dividends,  
interest, rental income, and capital gains. In addition, all nonwage forms  
of labor compensation are also excluded, such as employer-provided  
health insurance and subsidized parking. The tax on individuals,  
therefore, is essentially a payroll tax collected at the employee level.  
Most flat-tax proposals also allow the taxpayer to take personal  
exemptions and an additional exemption for each child in the household,  
effectively creating a zero tax rate for low-income filers. Under the   
Armey version of the flat tax, for example, a single filer is allowed a  
$13,100 exemption ($26,200 for married, filing jointly), and the plan  
allows for a $5,300 exemption per dependent. Having calculated taxable  
income net of the personal and child exemptions, a flat tax imposes a  
single tax rate on any remaining taxable income.  
<p>	  
The most striking feature of a flat tax is that it eliminates the special  
deductions, phase-outs, and credits in the federal income tax, ensuring  
that most individuals could calculate their tax liability easily -- hence the  
claims by flat-tax advocates that a tax return could be filed on a postcard.   
(In his plan, Specter retains the two most popular individual deductions,  
the home-mortgage interest and charitable deductions.)  
<p>	  
Simplicity for the individual is indeed one of the flat tax's best selling  
points. It is a point that is often oversold, however. Under the flat tax,  
there are two tax rates -- zero and approximately 20 percent. No doubt a  
reduction in the number of tax rates would make tax planning easier, but  
for most individuals the number of rates is irrelevant to their   
actual tax filing.  
<p>  
The simplification of the calculation of taxable income may also be  
oversold. For the approximately 80 million tax filers who take the  
standard deduction, the difference in tax computation between the flat tax  
and current law is that taxpayers today must add their interest, dividends,   
and capital gains to the tax base. They do not suffer the complexities of  
tax deductions because they opt for the standard deduction. For the  
approximately 32 million itemizers, the flat tax offers a clearly simpler  
system. But taxpayers who itemize do so voluntarily. They itemize   
because it lowers their tax liability. Thus, for itemizing taxpayers, the flat  
tax represents a loss of a preferred option in the way they file their taxes.  
Flat-tax advocates assume that most itemizing taxpayers would happily  
give up their credits and deductions in exchange for a simpler tax system.  
<p>	  
<b>Businesses under a flat tax.</b> The taxation of businesses under a flat tax  
makes even greater strides towards simplicity and neutrality. All  
businesses are treated the same; no distinction is made between  
partnerships, sole proprietorships, corporations, and any other business  
form. There is a single tax rate. And businesses are taxed on their net  
cash flow, not on their net income as under current law, thereby  
eliminating all the complications of attempting to match the timing of  
income and expenses.   
<p>	  
Under a flat tax, a business calculates its net cash flow for the year by  
totaling its receipts from all sources and subtracting all payments made  
to its employees and all payments made to other businesses for such  
things as plant and equipment and inventory. Businesses would deduct  
from income the full cost of their investments at the time of purchase,  
instead of stretching out these expenses according to complicated  
depreciation schedules. Employee fringe benefits would not be  
deductible. Nor would interest payments. The business then calculates its  
tax liability by applying a single tax rate to its net cash flow.  
<p>	  
<b>More than just a tax system.</b> In the current political environment, the flat  
tax is far more than an alternative tax system. The flat tax is also a strong  
political and philosophical statement about the role of tax policy in   
society, as seen most clearly in the strong preference of flat-tax advocates  
for a single tax rate for all taxpayers.   
<p>	  
For decades, the prevailing doctrine of "tax fairness" has dictated a highly  
progressive income-tax system. This means that, as a family's income  
rises, so do its average and marginal tax rates. Under current law,  
progressivity is achieved through a combination of deductions,  
exclusions, phase-outs, and rising tax rates imposed on a comprehensive  
measure of income. For example, in 1994 a married couple with $50,000  
in Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) and two children, taking the standard  
deduction, would pay 10.1 percent in federal income tax, whereas the  
same family with $100,000 in AGI would pay tax at an 18.5 percent rate.  
<p>	  
Under a flat 20 percent tax rate, a family would be subject to a 20 percent  
rate however high its labor income above a certain threshold. Having  
exempted lower-income taxpayers from the tax, many flat-tax advocates  
believe that proportionality, not progressivity, reflects the prevailing   
sense of fairness in America: Taxpayers should pay more tax as their  
incomes rise, but the amount of tax should not increase more than  
proportionally.  
<p>	  
Flat-tax proposals actually include two tax rates -- zero (by virtue of the  
personal exemptions) and about 20 percent. Some critics worry that the  
inclusion of a zero tax rate in the flat tax will maintain a large  
constituency for expanded government. The dangers are apparent in any   
general system of taxation that allows any but the poorest of the poor to  
escape paying at least some tax when they have taxable income. Taxes  
reflect a price we pay for government. Whenever someone escapes  
paying tax to finance government services, the direct cost of those  
services is zero and the amount of services demanded is high. Even a   
minimal tax of a few dollars a month would remind taxpayers                                                                   
that government services are not free.  
<p>	  
Many advocates of the flat tax are using the tax reform debate as a means  
of reshaping the political debate. By directly challenging the doctrine of  
tax progressivity in the federal tax system, they seek to change not only   
established ideas about desired tax burdens, but also the very notion of  
using the state as an instrument of incomes policy. Nor does the challenge  
stop there.   
<p>	  
Armey has included as part of his proposal the elimination of income-tax  
withholding. To many, withholding is simply a convenience whereby  
their employers subtract a certain amount from their paychecks each pay  
period based on an estimate of the total tax due for the year. To Armey  
and others, however, tax withholding disguises the true magnitude of the  
taxpayer's federal individual income-tax liability. By clouding the amount  
paid, they argue, taxpayers object less to the tax burden and to the  
amount of government spending that tax receipts make possible. By  
replacing the withholding mechanism with a monthly payment directly  
from the taxpayer to the Treasury, Armey believes he will bring powerful  
new forces to bear on the size of the tax burden and the size of  
government.

<b><a name="Economic Benefits">ECONOMIC BENEFITS</a></b><br> 

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
Tax reform is a long and difficult process. Even the adoption of an ideal  
tax system creates transition costs for taxpayers, economic dislocation,  
and uncertainty. What benefits would justify these costs?  
<p>	  
<b>Saving, investment, and economic growth.</b> The net national savings rate  
in the U.S. has averaged 2.7 percent per year in the 1990s, less than one  
third the rate of the 1950s and 1960s. The savings rate is a prime  
determinant of the growth of incomes and wealth, so a low savings rate  
obviously does not bode well for future growth in standards of living.   
Certainly one contributing factor to the low savings rate is the high tax  
rate on saving and investment, due in part to the double taxation of  
income from capital. The flat tax would tax income from capital only  
once -- in the form of a tax on business income. Dividends, capital gains,  
interest payments, and other forms of capital income received by  
individuals would not be taxed, because they had already been taxed  
before. The flat tax would thereby reduce the tax burden on saving,  
which means, everything else held constant, that a flat tax would increase  
the rate of private saving.  
<p>	  
The flat tax may also reduce the tax burden on investment by eliminating  
the double taxation of corporate income and allowing businesses to  
deduct in full the cost of their plant and equipment purchases. However,  
the flat tax also appears to increase the overall tax burden of businesses   
(more on this later) so the net effect on investment incentives   
may be muted.   
<p>	  
The purpose of  encouraging saving and investment is, of course, to  
promote faster non-inflationary economic growth, boost real wages, and  
raise the nation's standard of living. At a recent conference sponsored by  
the Hoover Institution, Dale W. Jorgenson of Harvard presented a paper,   
"The Economic Impact of Fundamental Tax Reform," showing that the  
adoption of a consumption tax such as the flat tax would increase the  
discounted value of Americans' future income by about $1.3 trillion.  
<p>	  
Such increases certainly justify considering a change in tax systems.  
Projecting increases in economic activity is risky business, however,  
since the projections always depend on the underlying assumptions. At  
the same conference, Laurence J. Kotlikoff of Boston University  
presented results based on a different type of economic model indicating  
that a switch to a consumption tax would eventually increase real wages  
by 7 percent and GDP per capita by 8 percent. These two studies are  
impressive and, because they are based on different types of models,  
credibly imply that the economy would perform significantly better under  
a flat tax or another consumption tax than it would under the current  
income tax.	  
<p> 
It is important to recognize that accelerated economic growth also means  
accelerated tax collections for federal, state, and local governments.  
While congressional and Treasury Department analysts persist in  
ignoring these additional revenues, policymakers should understand that   
additional economic growth will mean additional tax revenue. Using  
Jorgenson's estimates of economic growth, in present-value terms a flat  
tax could eventually raise well over $200 billion in additional federal  
revenues and $150 billion in additional state and local revenues.  
<p>	  
<b>Compliance and administrative-cost savings.</b> According to an analysis by  
the Tax Foundation, the annual compliance costs associated with the  
federal personal and corporate income taxes are roughly $200 billion.  
These costs result from recordkeeping, tax filing, litigation and appeals,   
and so forth. In addition, the federal government spends almost $14  
billion administering the system, for a total annual cost of well over $800  
per person.   
<p>	  
Most compliance costs are borne by the business sector, and most of  
these costs can be attributed to those areas of the tax code dealing with  
the timing of income and expense, and with the taxation of foreign- 
source income. The flat tax is a tax on cash flow, and so at a stroke it  
eliminates the issue of timing. It also exempts from U.S. tax the foreign-  
source income of U.S. citizens, so it eliminates this compliance cost as  
well. And, at the individual level, most compliance costs arise in relation  
to capital income, which would no longer be taxed, so these costs, too,  
disappear. While every tax system imposes some administrative and   
compliance costs, there is good reason to believe the flat tax eventually  
would dramatically reduce this burden on the taxpayer and on the  
economy.  
<p>	  
<b>Thoughts of lower interest rates.</b> Proponents of the flat tax (and of many  
other tax reform proposals) often suggest that lower (nominal, after-tax)  
interest rates would ensue. If a flat tax raises saving levels as promised,  
the amount of capital available for domestic and foreign investment  
would increase and, if everything else were held constant, this could  
reduce interest rates under certain circumstances. Everything else is not  
held equal, however. 
<p>
The flat tax may also improve investment  
opportunities by reducing the marginal tax burden on capital income.  
Recall that the double taxation of corporate income would cease and   
that businesses could, for example, expense their capital purchases. Thus,  
the domestic demand for new investment in plant and equipment may  
also increase. At this point, we cannot say whether saving would increase  
more or less rapidly than investment. 
<p>
However, as the modern mantra  
runs, we live in a global economy, and no markets are more completely  
integrated than the capital markets. This means that, to the extent   
domestic saving exceeds the demands of the economy for capital, the  
excess saving finds its way overseas in search of more profitable  
investments. And, when domestic saving is insufficient to meet domestic  
investment demands, we import capital from abroad. Thus, whether  
domestic saving increases more rapidly than investment following a flat  
tax, or vice versa, no significant effect on after-tax interest rates should   
be anticipated on this score. 
<p>
Pre-tax interest rates are nevertheless sure to  
decline following a flat tax. Interest rates reflect many factors, including  
expected inflation, a real, after-tax required rate of  return, a degree of  
uncertainty and, possibly, a degree of credit-market tightness. Interest  
rates also reflect the taxes the interest income recipient must pay, which  
explains, for example, why there is a significant difference in the interest   
rates paid to taxable and tax-exempt bond holders. Under a flat tax,  
interest income is tax-exempt, so pre-tax interest rates would fall to about  
what are currently the rates paid on tax-exempt bonds. 
<p>
On the flip side,  
interest expense is not deductible under a flat tax, so there would be no  
net reduction in after-tax interest costs to borrowers and hence little or no  
stimulation of growth from lower interest rates.  
<p>

<b><a name="Middle-Class">PROBLEM #1: A MIDDLE-CLASS TAX BURDEN</a></b><br>  

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	  
At the tax rates currently discussed, the flat tax appears to impose a  
higher share of the total federal tax burden on middle-class taxpayers and  
appears to raise their taxes in dollar terms as well. Each of these  
represents an enormous political problem for flat-tax advocates.  
<p>	  
A progressive rate structure means that upper-income taxpayers pay a  
higher proportion of their labor income in taxes than do all other  
taxpayers. A revenue-neutral flat tax would shift some of the tax burden  
on labor income from upper-income taxpayers onto the middle class. This  
shift of tax burden to the middle class is exacerbated by the exclusion   
of capital income from the tax base, which on a per-capita basis is a  
larger fraction of a typical upper-income individual's taxable income than  
that of a middle-income individual. Finally, large personal exemptions  
would remove millions of lower-income individuals from the tax rolls.   
Consequently, the middle class would be forced to bear a greater share  
yet of the total tax burden.  
<p>	  
Flat-tax advocates take the fairness issue head on by advocating only one  
(or two) tax rates. Where the flat tax really attempts to redefine tax  
fairness, however, is in the exclusion of capital income from the tax base.  
Justice and tax neutrality are both served by excluding capital income  
since the capital has already been subject to tax at least once, if not   
many times over. Nevertheless, a clear problem of perceptions must be  
admitted.  
<p>	  
Consider two families. The Joneses have a combined salary of $50,000 in  
wages and salary. Under the Armey plan with a 20 percent tax rate, this  
family of four would owe $3,700 in tax. Now consider the Smiths, who  
in retirement consume every dollar of their $1 million in dividend  
income. Under the flat tax, the Smiths owe no tax at all because capital  
income is excluded from the tax base. This is appropriate, because their  
dividend income was taxed at least once before the Smith family received  
it. But the perception would persist that a wealthy family is paying no tax.  
<p>

is considered along with wage

<Font Size="2"><b>Less progressive.</b>  One potential criticism of the flat tax is that high-income groups appear to pay a lower percentage of their personal income in taxes than middle-income groups.  This occurs because higher-income groups receive a greater share of their earnings from capital income, which is exempt under the flat tax.  <b>Source:</b>  The Tax Foundation.<br>

<p>
income, average tax rates for higher- 
income groups are lower than for middle-income groups under the  
individual side of the flat tax (see chart below). And so this may be the  
Achilles' heel of a flat tax: Are the majority of the American people  
willing to define tax fairness entirely in terms of labor income? Can tax  
fairness be defined in such a way that individuals who consume 
significant  
amounts of capital income would be allowed to pay little or no tax? If so,  
then the flat tax has overcome its biggest hurdle. If not, then a flat tax  
solely on labor income probably cannot succeed.   
<p>	  
Flat-tax advocates can overcome this hurdle through careful analysis. As  
we shall soon see, a flat tax will shift the incidence of taxation sharply  
from individuals to business. While individuals will pay no tax on their  
own capital income, the businesses from which they earn capital income   
will pay higher taxes. The crucial point is this: The burden of business  
taxes is ultimately borne not by the entities that pay them but, one way or  
another, by workers (in the form of lower compensation) or by business  
owners (in the form of lower profits), who tend to belong to the higher- 
income group.  
<p>	  
The chart on page 29 shows the average tax paid at different income  
levels under a flat tax when business taxes are imputed to individuals.  
Following procedures adopted by the Congressional Budget Office, the  
Tax Foundation assumes that half of the business tax is ultimately paid by   
business owners and half is paid through reduced labor compensation.  
The imputation of the business tax shows a disproportionate share of the  
business-tax burden falling on upper-income taxpayers.  
<p>	  
The chart shows the distribution of the tax burden when we account for  
both the individual and business taxes under current law, under the  
Armey proposal with a 20 percent rate (which Armey argues reduces  
revenues by $40 billion annually relative to current law), and under a  
revenue-neutral version of the Armey proposal which the Tax   
Foundation calculates would require a 21.1 percent rate. (The lower rate  
claimed by Armey probably arises because his plan, by design, loses  
revenue relative to current law.) As the chart shows, when income is  
measured comprehensively and both labor and business income are taxed,  
the flat tax imposes a remarkably proportional tax burden (once  
individuals earn enough to pay tax).   
<p>	  
Analysis of the likely distribution of the tax burden also reveals some  
disturbing news for flat-tax advocates, however: At the proposed rates,  
the flat tax would impose a tax increase on middle-income taxpayers.  
This obviously creates an enormous political problem for flat-tax  
proponents. Many middle-income voters may object to a significant tax   
increase in exchange for a simpler tax system and the   
promise of a stronger economy. One solution is, of course, to   
cut spending to reduce the tax rate below 17 percent. This is   
Armey's solution. As noted below, however, this is far easier   
said than done.   
<p>
<center> 
<b><a name="Business End">PROBLEM #2:  THE BUSINESS END</a></b><br>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	 
Successful tax reform must always originate in the barber shops and  
bingo parlors outside the Washington Beltway. Without sustained popular  
support, the enormous effort of fundamental reform will fall short. A new  
tax principle, having gained the necessary popular support, must then  
gain the support, or at least the acquiescence, of the bulk of the business  
community. Tax reform that fails employers will fail their employees as  
well.   
<p>	 
The simplicity of the flat tax would eventually benefit the business sector  
by reducing both compliance costs and the uncertainty that a complex tax  
code imposes on business decisions. On the other hand, the business  
sector, at least under the Armey flat tax, appears to bear a much higher  
share of the total federal tax burden. Currently, the business sector bears  
about 31 percent of the burden. Under the Armey flat tax, according to  
Tax Foundation analysis, the business sector would bear about 50 percent  
of the burden, an increase of about two thirds. In other words, under the  
Armey plan about 19 percent of the total tax collection is shifted from  
individuals to businesses. The higher burden on businesses is due to  such  
things as the loss of the deductions for state and local taxes and for  
employee fringe benefits. (Some of this burden would eventually be  
shifted back to individuals, as companies convert fringe benefits into  
labor income on which individuals would have to pay taxes.)  
<p> 	 
It is, of course, true that businesses only collect taxes; individuals  
ultimately bear the tax burden. Nevertheless, business leaders are very  
aware of their average tax rate and the after-tax earnings they report to  
their owners. The business community in the aggregate suffered a hefty  
tax increase as part of the 1986 Tax Reform Act, though much smaller  
than that apparent in the Armey flat tax. Many of today's CEOs and chief  
financial officers were tax directors and tax vice-presidents in 1986, and  
they remember how a laudatory tax principle eventually boomeranged to  
their firms' detriment. Business owners are likely to resist any tax  
proposal that would raise their effective tax rates, even if it promised to  
accelerate economic growth.   
<p>	 
At the very least, successful tax reform should probably avoid increasing  
the net tax burden on America's businesses. Even so, such reform would  
still create lists of winners, losers, and uncertains. Traditionally, the  
uncertains oppose tax reform while projected losers fight harder against   
their losses than winners will fight for their gains, so even a revenue- 
neutral tax reform between individuals and businesses is likely to create  
important opposition to a flat tax.  
<p>
<center>
<b><a name="Other Obstacles">OTHER OBSTACLES</a></b><br>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	 
Aside from the basic tax-burden questions, there is a long list of obstacles  
for the flat tax to overcome:  
<p>	 
<b>Charitable contributions.</b> Under the current income tax, itemizing  
taxpayers can deduct amounts contributed to charitable organizations  
(churches, certain civic groups, educational institutions, research  
organizations, etc.) in calculating their taxable income. The charitable  
deduction is defended by politically powerful organizations from Harvard   
University and the Boy Scouts to the Catholic Church and the American  
Association of Retired Persons. For itemizers, contributions to these  
groups under current law are made in pre-tax dollars. Under a flat tax, the  
tax incentive to make a contribution is eliminated, so all such  
contributions must be made in after-tax dollars. Some decline in  
charitable giving should be expected for virtually all charities, at least  
initially, following the enactment of the tax. Over the long run, of   
course, the higher incomes and capital accumulation produced by a flat  
tax will lead to increases in giving that will offset the initial decline. Even  
so, charitable groups, recognizing the immediate threat to their funding,  
will surely lobby to keep the charitable deduction in the tax base.   
<p>	 
<b>Tax receipts under the Armey plan.</b> Flat-tax advocates also often strongly  
favor a smaller federal government, and the arguments in favor of one  
occasionally intermingle with arguments in favor of the other. However,  
a flat tax implies little or nothing about the desired level of government   
spending or taxation. It is a revenue system capable of raising a wide  
range of tax revenue levels depending on the tax rate chosen. Without  
question, a flat tax would be easier to enact and implement if the federal  
government
<p>

<hr width="50%">
<Font Size="2"><b>More proportional.</b>  When income is defined comprehensively to include business income, taxes on higher-income groups remain remarkably proportional.  That's because the flat tax appears to shift some of the overall tax burden to businesses, whose taxes are borne disproportionately by (higher-income) business owners.  <b>Source:</b>  The Tax Foundation.<br>

<p>
needed less revenue. General tax cuts would help avoid the  
contest of winners and losers that typically impede tax reforms. Also,   
all tax reforms impose adjustment costs on the economy as resources are  
re-allocated and re-priced. These costs would be easier to bear in the  
context of reduced overall tax burdens.   
<p>	 
The initial tax rate under the Armey flat tax is set at 20 percent, which  
Armey argues would reduce federal collections by about $40 billion  
annually; the tax rate drops two years later to 17 percent. The Armey plan  
argues forcefully for funding these cuts with spending cuts. Over the   
traditional five-year budget window, setting the flat rate at 20 percent  
means cutting spending by about $250 billion. To put it in perspective,  
the budget passed by the House Budget Committee in May to eliminate  
the deficit called for spending cuts of $459 billion over five years.   
<p>	 
The spending cuts needed to fund the Armey flat tax would be in addition  
to those in the Fiscal Year 1996 Budget Resolution. For advocates of a  
dramatically smaller government, a call for additional spending cuts to  
fund flat-tax reform is more of an opportunity than a problem. But,   
given the difficulties of achieving the cuts in the budget resolution, it is  
fair to question whether additional cuts of this size are possible. At this  
stage, the possible responses of the flat-tax advocates would seem to be  
either that the revenue scoring must include revenue gains from projected   
accelerated economic growth or that the extra spending cuts are possible  
and desirable.  
<p>	 
<b>The flat tax and the health care debate.</b> Under a flat tax, the employer  
would no longer be allowed to deduct the cost of employee health- 
insurance coverage. This arrangement eliminates a serious distortion in  
the current system -- the tax advantage of employer-provided health   
insurance. Denying employers the ability to deduct the cost of health  
insurance will discourage them from continuing to provide insurance as a  
benefit. Instead, they are likely to raise wage and salary income, and  
families would have to buy their own insurance. Eventually, such a  
family-based system should work as well for health insurance as it does  
for any other form of insurance.  
<p>	 
At the outset, the flat tax could expose individuals to much higher  
insurance premiums if they no longer receive the benefit of group rates.  
This is a serious transition issue for the flat tax for which no good  
solution seems available. One could, for example, require employers to  
continue to offer insurance for a specified period following tax reform.   
Another solution would be to require insurers to continue coverage  
indefinitely for previously covered employees, and set insurance  
premiums at the levels applicable to the employee's previous group.   
<p> 
<b>Double taxation and state and local taxes.</b> Alongside tax neutrality,  
avoiding double taxation between tax jurisdictions is a fundamental goal  
of good tax policy. Double taxation occurs when an individual pays tax to  
one entity and must pay tax to another jurisdiction on the tax paid to the  
first. For example, when a taxpayer pays $100 in state tax ad the federal  
government includes that $100 in the taxpayer's income for federal  
income-tax purposes, then the individual is effectively paying tax on  
taxes received by the state. This is unfair to the taxpayer.  
<p>	 
With the exception of sales taxes, state and local taxes are currently  
deductible for itemizers at the individual level and for all corporate  
taxpayers, thereby avoiding double taxation. This deduction is typically  
eliminated under a flat tax, thereby assuring double taxation and bringing  
new pressures on state and local government finances. A flat tax would  
disproportionately raise the costs of living and doing business in high-tax  
states and localities. Recognizing the threat, state and local government  
officials would strenuously oppose this change in policy. On the other  
hand, many advocates of smaller government would applaud the  
additional fiscal pressures on government under a flat tax, even at the  
price of a measure of unfairness.   
<p>	 
<b>Transition issues.</b> They say the Devil is in the details, and that is certainly  
true of tax reform. But the Devil is in his Heaven when dealing with  
transition issues. A complicated economy subject to a complex tax  
system produces extraordinary business and contractual arrangements. A   
simpler tax system may eliminate the need for some of these  
complications going forward, but the old arrangements would still be in  
force and must be addressed. The limited space available here precludes a  
discussion of these issues, but they would include the depreciation of  
previously purchased plant and equipment, the taxation of deferred  
foreign-source income, the use of accumulated Alternative Minimum Tax   
Credits, etc.

<p>	 
Tax reform, and the flat tax in particular, is intended to replace a very  
poor tax system with a simpler tax promising better economic  
performance. Once such a system has been designed, the level of  
collections demanded of it is a matter of choosing the tax rate.  
<p>	 
The federal government, however, collects a wide variety of other taxes,  
including sales taxes on gasoline and other items, payroll taxes, and user  
fees which should also be considered for replacement. For example,  
federal sales taxes are highly distortionary, require separate and costly  
collection mechanisms, and are generally thought to be regressive.   
<p>	 
Once a new tax base has been established, strong arguments should be  
required in favor of keeping any of the other existing components of the  
federal tax system. Failing such arguments, we should give serious  
consideration to replacing these other, inferior tax systems, making up the   
revenue with a higher flat tax rate. A flat-tax rate of between 38 and 40  
percent would likely raise enough revenue to allow the elimination of the  
payroll tax and all other federal taxes.  
<p>	 
The nation faces many serious economic problems, including Social  
Security and Medicare systems racing towards bankruptcy, a costly  
private health-care system, and high regulatory burdens. So tax reform  
has some steep competition for national attention. It is all the more   
impressive, therefore, that the flat tax's advocates have succeeded in  
moving tax reform to the forefront so quickly. Replacing the current tax  
system with something significantly better, whether a flat tax or an  
alternative, will not solve all our economic ills. But the more rapid  
economic growth it promises may make finding the other solutions a   
little easier.

deductions head on. The most important deduction for most itemizing individuals is the mortgage-interest deduction. Many observers defend this deduction as encouraging home ownership; some argue that it is necessary for tax neutrality. Under the Armey flat tax, the deduction disappears.
<p>
Many groups believe they would be injured by the elimination of the mortgage-interest deduction. They 
argue, for example, that the loss of the deduction would raise the cost of home ownership, reduce the value of existing homes, and generally cripple the home building industry. In combination, the realtors, the home-builders, the mortgage lenders, and the construction-workers unions make a very powerful lobby, particularly when millions of homeowners are added to the mix.
<p>
The concerns of the mortgage-interest deduction lobby are generally misplaced. As noted above in the 
discussion on interest rates, the tax a saver must pay on interest income is recovered by demanding a higher interest rate. Since a flat tax does not tax individual interest income, pretax market interest rates will fall significantly, just as tax-exempt bonds now pay interest more than 2 percentage points below the rate paid to taxable bonds. Mortgage lenders, seeing their cost of funds fall, will be driven by competition to pass these savings along to mortgage borrowers in the form of lower mortgage rates.
<p>
In after-tax terms, the elimination of the home-mortgage deduction will neither raise nor lower the interest
cost of home-mortgage borrowing. Therefore, that reform should have no affect on the demand for homes or on property values.
<p>
The benefit of lower mortgage rates does not extend to current mortgage holders unless they refinance their mortgages. Thus a legitimate problem is the treatment of mortgages underwritten prior to the enactment of a flat tax. Most of these borrowers assumed they would be able to deduct mortgage interest paid, thereby producing a lower after-tax interest rate and a lower tax burden. Since an estimated 27.4 million taxpayers will claim this deduction in 1995 to the tune of about $238 billion, a potentially huge bloc of voters stand ready to join the ranks of flat-tax opponents. While many or most may be able-to refinance, refinancing may be impractical for many current mortgage holders if, for example, they expect to sell the property in the following year or two.
<p>
A fair (and politically sensible) solution to the old mortgages problem might be to allow homeowners to 
deduct the interest on mortgages taken before the flat tax is enacted. While fairness demands 
grandfathering pre-existing mortgages, the consequence would be a slightly more complicated tax system and a short and medium-term erosion of the tax base, which would have to be offset with initially higher tax rates.
<p>
A loss in the battle over the mortgage interest deduction would not derail the essential effort to develop a flatter, simpler, more saver-friendly tax system. It would, however, require a much higher tax rate initially, and it would make it harder to repeal other popular deductions, like that for charitable contributions.

<b>Policy Review</b><br>

<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</I></center>

<p>

	Profit and the environment are supposed to be enemies. Remember that the next time you visit Yellowstone National Park, one of the crown jewels of the national park system and a popular attraction for tourists, backpackers, and amateur botanists, zoologists, and geologists. Yellowstone boasts some of the most breathtaking sights in all of North America. It also boasts an interesting capitalistic pedigree.
<p>	It was the Northern Pacific Railroad, a private corporation, that funded early expeditions to the Yellowstone region and helped establish the Yellowstone National Park in 1872. "Because it provided the main form of transportation to the region," report economists Terry Anderson and Donald Leal, "the railroad could profit from preservation of this scenic wonder and therefore had an incentive to preserve it." Many other Western parks were promoted and protected by private railroad and development companies for the same reason.
<p>	More recently, some private timber companies have found that, by exploring other uses of the forest lands they own, they can increase their profits. In International Paper's commercial forests in Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas, company biologist Tom Bourland implemented a fee-based recreation program to make money from not harvesting trees. His program charged hunters for access and leased small tracts of land on which families could park their motor homes and enjoy the woods. After three years, International Paper saw its revenues from the program triple, constituting 25 percent of its total profits from the area. Since this valuable use of private land relied on beauty and diverse wildlife rather than ease of harvest, the company had an incentive to preserve habitat for white-tailed deer, wild turkey, fox, squirrel, quail, bald eagles, and red-cockaded woodpeckers.
<p>	Deseret Land and Livestock pursued a similar strategy when its cattle ranch fell on hard times. The firm's managers decided to invest in wildlife habitat, charging hunters for the right to hunt elk and other animals. Herds of elk and mule deer -- now a valuable commodity -- on Deseret land actually grew, and the company thrived. The 1,289-square-mile King Ranch in south Texas now makes 60 percent of its income from business activities other than cattle -- including revenues from hunters and nature lovers.
<p>	Within the corporate social-responsibility movement, there is no more important issue than environmentalism. Often, the call for corporate responsibility and the exhortation to "save the planet" from a host of environmental problems seem virtually to be the same thing. The firms most often honored for their responsibility -- such as the Body Shop, Patagonia, and Ben and Jerry's -- usually exhibit some sort of (highly publicized) commitment to environmental goals. "Corporations, because they are the dominant institution on the planet, must squarely face the social and environmental problems that afflict humankind," states Paul Hawken, a founder of Smith and Hawken catalog company. "How," he asks, "does business face the prospect that creating a profitable, growing company requires an intolerable abuse of the natural world?"
<p>	The notion that profit and ecology must be at loggerheads, and that businesses must place environmental obligations above economic ones, is but one viewpoint among social-responsibility advocates. A different notion, championed most famously by Vice President Al Gore, is that doing business in an "environmentally friendly" way is also to increase the profitability of firms. "We can prosper," he wrote in his book <i>Earth in the Balance</i>, "by leading the environmental revolution and producing for the world marketplace the new products and technologies that foster economic progress without environmental destruction."
<p>	When you think through the complex issue of corporate environmental responsibility, however, neither Hawken's "win-lose" proposition nor Gore's "win-win" proposition ultimately satisfies. Both have merit, but ignore the most important characteristic of environmental ethics: uncertainty. For Hawken, the fact that the world is headed for catastrophe is scarcely debatable. Only if you buy his apocalyptic predictions about overpopulation, global climate change, deforestation, and depletion of natural resources does his recipe for a low-growth, heavily regulated, "sustainable" economy make any sense. 
<p>	In Gore's case, he makes no conceptual distinction between profiting from innovation and profiting from regulation. Throughout much of his book, he argues that governments should make environmental regulations more strict, repeating many of the doomsday scenarios of which Hawken is fond, but then concludes that American firms can make money designing technologies to meet the higher standards. This is no doubt true, but it ignores the firms -- actually shareholders, workers, and consumers -- who clearly lose when regulatory standards change.
<p>	Innovative compliance might reduce the cost of regulation, but it doesn't eliminate it. For example, a state might decide to require that only cars fueled by electric batteries will be sold within its borders. This might well lead to the development of better, cheaper electric cars, as firms struggle to capture as much as they can of the new automobile market, but that's not the only consideration. Under the mandate, consumers would lose access to the products they prefer. Some individuals and businesses would leave the state entirely. The resulting costs and dislocations would far exceed the environmental benefits of lower auto emissions, which are questionable in any event. (The generation of electricity for the cars, for example, would still produce some air or water pollution.)
<p>	Gore, in other words, is essentially arguing that it's worth building a better mousetrap, regardless of how many mice you think may be actually running around in your house. But what if the more pressing problem you face in your home is termite infestation? Then the mousetrap doesn't help you.
<p>	In a different sense, though, Gore is on exactly the right track in charting a course for corporate responsibility on environmental matters. Corporations are not governments. They are not charities. They are unlikely to be successful if they pursue the same sorts of strategies that governments and philanthropic organizations use to protect wildlife habitats and promote clean air and water, such as setting and enforcing standards of health and safety for the public. Corporate America's unique contribution to solving real environmental problems will come from innovation -- finding new ways to produce goods and services, package and deliver them to consumers, and dispose of or recycle the wastes generated by their own production or by consumption.
<p>
<b>Pollution and Profits</b>
<p>	Corporate innovation in the pollution-reduction area is already widespread. The "Pollution Prevention Pays" program begun by Minnesota-based 3M in 1975 has reduced the company's emissions by more than a billion pounds while saving $500 million.
<p>	"At our company, we view a good portion of the environmental problems most talked about today as symptoms of an underlying disease," said 3M chairman Livio D. DeSimone. "That disease is waste -- the wasteful and inefficient utilization of our resources."<p>
	Similarly, Dow Chemical and Westinghouse have implemented waste reduction strategies that have saved millions of dollars since the mid-1980s. One Westinghouse plant in Puerto Rico reduced "dragout" -- the contamination accidentally spread as chemicals flow from one tank to another -- by 75 percent by shaking the tank to remove solids before releasing the chemical on to the next tank. Chevron saved $10 million in waste disposal costs and reduced hazardous waste by 60 percent in the first three years of its "Save Money and Reduce Toxics" (SMART) program.<p>
	Over the past few decades, timber companies have found that "sustainable-yield forestry" -- including preventing fires, spraying for pests, and quickly replanting harvested areas -- produces less waste and higher profits while also preserving habitat for wildlife. In addition, they have reformed their manufacturing processes, for example by using leftovers from lumbering to make paper pulp and to generate steam for paper mills. International Paper saved about $100 million in disposal expenses between 1988 and 1995 by recycling and reusing its manufacturing wastes.
<p>To be successful both at saving money and "saving the planet," however, corporate waste-reduction programs can't be based on rhetoric or ideology or guesswork about what is or isn't environmentally friendly. One of the greatest myths propagated by the corporate social-responsibility movement is that the most environmentally friendly way to produce goods and services is already known, and that all corporate executives need do is embrace the environmental ethic. This is untrue. Often, the consequences of corporate decisions are ambiguous in terms of overall affect on species, health, air, and water quality, and the global environment. In some cases, the very practices advocated by environmental activists harm the environment.
<p>	Consider the historical example of the automobile. Given the attention paid to air pollution and oil spills, one might believe that the environment would be better off if cars had never been invented and mass-produced for widespread use. But such a judgment would be hasty. Although cars created a new source of air pollution, they also virtually eliminated one of the oldest sources of air and water pollution known to man: animal dung.
<p>	A horse, for instance, produces about 45 pounds of manure each day. In American cities before the advent of automobiles, massive amounts of horse manure collected daily on streets, sidewalks, and public property. The resulting mess fouled the air, and contaminated water and food. It had to be collected and dumped or buried, often at great expense. And the horses died. In the late 19th century, New York City had to dispose of some 15,000 dead horses a year. Sometimes this difficult task wasn't performed as quickly as it should have been, resulting in outbreaks of disease.
<p>	In 1885, a British writer described London in the supposedly pristine days before the car. "It is a vast stagnant swamp, which no man dare enter, since death would be his inevitable fate. There exhales from this oozy mass so fatal a vapor that no animal can endure it. The black water bears a greenish-brown floating scum, which forever bubbles up from the putrid mud of the bottom. . . . It is dead."
<p>	Fred Smith, the president of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, in Washington, D.C., and a former environmental regulator, notes that the automobile swept away many of these environmental problems. Besides reducing the need to deal with horse and draught-animal wastes and corpses, the car "encouraged developments that reduce air pollution," he observed in Reason magazine. Before the automobile, most urban homes and businesses were heated with coal, an extremely dirty source of energy that spewed sulfur dioxide, particulates, and toxic ash into the air. As the demand for gasoline stimulated oil exploration, heating oil and natural gas became cheaper and more readily available.
<p>	Did the inventors and early manufacturers of the automobile perceive its potential environmental benefits? Have General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler been run by environmental activists for the past half-century? Hardly. Their environmental records are mixed. Nor have all the environmental problems created by the human need for transportation and fuel been "solved" -- particularly in those unique areas, such as southern California, where topography and climate make auto emissions, regardless of how numerous their source, a continuing problem. The automobile example shows only that economic decisions, motivated by an insatiable demand for higher productivity, lower costs, and bigger profit margins, can have unforeseen benefits for third parties and the environment.
<P>
<b>It's Not Easy Being Green</b>
<p>	One problem for corporate managers is that years of apocalyptic rhetoric and breathless media coverage have created environmental illiteracy among many Americans, including potential consumers and employees. When McDonald's first began to research whether its plastic "clamshell" hamburger boxes posed a significant waste-disposal problem, company scientists came to the conclusion that paper wrappers would actually be harder to recycle. But in a well-publicized 1990 decision, the restaurant chain nevertheless switched to paper.
<p>	The reason wasn't sound environmental policymaking, but public relations. A letter-writing campaign organized by environmental activists and teachers had schoolchildren across the country telling their favorite fast-food outlet (and their parents) that they wanted paper rather than plastic to "save the planet." McDonald's complied. Subsequently, a study in <i>Science</i> concluded that the plastic alternative was less environmentally harmful, once all the relevant costs -- such as the energy expended to make the paper wrappings -- were factored in.
<p>    Not only did McDonald's appear to make the environmentally "wrong" decision, but the company also nipped a promising business venture in the bud. Before the paper-packaging decision was announced, Dow Chemical and seven other plastic manufacturers had formed the National Polystyrene Recycling Company to recycle polystyrene from 450 McDonald's restaurants. The switch to paper nixed the deal, which would have advanced plastics recycling.
<p>	The effect of corporate decisions on the environment are, in other words, extremely difficult to predict with accuracy. Corporations pursuing profit have as much chance of generating environmental benefits as regulators or environmental activists do -- particularly when they are faced with prices for waste disposal that are as close to cost as possible.
<p>	For natural resources over which property rights are relatively easy to establish, such as oil, minerals, or timber, prices serve as an early-warning signal to companies about scarcity. If the price is rising, that suggests more demand for the resource than can be met by available supply. Companies then have a financial incentive either to find new supplies or to reduce its need by developing alternatives or ferreting out waste. This market process amounts to a sort of ongoing environment research project seeking an answer to this question: What is the most efficient and least resource-depleting method of producing the goods and services people need?
<p>	A good example of how this process works can be found in the development by Bristol-Myers-Squibb of a new way to make Taxol, a treatment for ovarian and breast cancer. Taxol had been made from the bark of the endangered Pacific yew tree, but the process killed the tree. Responding to the mounting cost of obtaining Pacific yew bark, the company found a way to make Taxol from the needles and twigs of the more common Himalayan yew tree, thus assuring a continued supply of Taxol while reducing the need to harvest the endangered species.
<p>	For resources over which property rights haven't been established, either because of technical difficulty or because of bad public-policy decisions, the pricing system doesn't work as well. When governments relieve corporations of the need for pay the full cost of disposing of waste, for example, by operating and subsidizing waste collection, landfills, incinerators, and recycling programs, they reduce the incentive for those corporations to find alternative methods that produce less waste.
<p>	
<b>Environmental Surprises</b>
<p>	Some ecological benefits come from surprising places. Man-made pesticides and the companies that produce them, for example, are often reviled for the risks they supposedly pose to humans and habitats. But according to Dennis Avery, the director of global food issues for the Hudson Institute, the Herculean efforts by American companies and researchers to make farming more productive -- by introducing insecticides, herbicides, crop-breeding, and genetic engineering -- have reduced the need for farmland in the United States and other countries. Besides lowering the real price and improving the quality of the foods consumers buy, this happy result has had the side-effect of protecting forests and other sensitive habitats from being cleared for agriculture. "Today's typical environmentalist worries about how many spiders and pigweeds survive in an acre of monoculture corn without giving environmental credit for the millions of organisms thriving on the two acres that didn't have to be plowed because we tripled crop yields," Avery comments.
<p>	Actually, reducing the price and improving the quality of agricultural produce has had its own salutary effects on human health. Throughout human history, most people in most societies have had little to eat. Starvation has until recently been the typical state of much of the Earth's population. Only within the past century, and especially since the early 1900s, has agricultural productivity increased rapidly enough to guarantee a plentiful supply of food at affordable prices in developed countries. 		Much of this productivity is due to the invention and production of agricultural chemicals and the development of new farming practices by American entrepreneurs. Even today, herbicides and pesticides make fruits and vegetables cheaper and more attractive. One study by Texas A&M University researchers found that without pesticides, potato yields would drop 50 percent, orange yields by 55 percent, and corn yields by 78 percent. Prices for these commodities would rise tremendously without pesticides.
<p>	Companies introducing these agricultural innovations have clearly advanced the interests of their shareholders, too. The Monsanto Co., founded in 1901 to produce saccharin in competition with German firms, has since diversified into chemicals, fibers, plastics, and pharmaceuticals. Two of its most profitable products for the past 30 years have been the popular herbicides Lasso (introduced in 1969) and Roundup (1973), one of the best-selling agricultural products of all time. Monsanto continues to introduce new products to increase agricultural productivity, such as Posilac, which boosts milk production in cows and reduces per-unit consumption of feed grains.
<p>
<b>Plastic Pleasures</b>
<p>	If anything symbolizes the irresponsible corporation in the minds of many theorists, it is the manufacturer of that epitome of 20th-century wastefulness, plastic. Typically made from oil, a nonrenewable resource, plastic has come to represent everything that is wrong with American commercial life and our "throwaway culture." But is plastic really a significant environmental problem? Does it provide no benefits to human health and safety or the environment that need to be weighed?
<p>	William Rathje, a professor of archeology at the University of Arizona, has spent years studying solid-waste disposal patterns. His excavations of landfills have found that plastics make up about 7 percent by weight and 16 percent by volume of the typical landfill -- much less than paper or yard waste. Polystyrene plastic, used in drinking cups and those "clamshell" hamburger containers McDonald's abandoned, makes up only 1 percent of landfill volume. Fast-food packaging amounts to no more than one-third of 1 percent. Of course, environmentalists fault plastic for much more than taking up space in landfills. They point out that plastic manufacturing relies on extracting and transporting oil. But since less than 2 percent of the world's petroleum is used to produce petrochemicals of all kinds, from fertilizers to plastics, the impact on oil consumption of using plastic to make consumer products is negligible.<p>
	Consider, on the other hand, the benefits of plastic. Even something as banal as plastic wrap has been a tremendous boon for Americans' health and safety. A hundred years ago, grocery stores had little in the way of prepackaged foods. At the turn of the century, paper packaging began to enter food retailing, but it had limitations. Meat, for example, was still often shipped in the form of whole carcasses only 50 years ago. Consumers would request particular cuts of meat from butchers, who kept carcasses until they were all sold or completely spoiled. The meat was expensive, particularly because butchers spent so much time carving it.
<p>	During the 1950s, however, the advent of plastic packaging began to change food delivery. Dow Chemical of Midland, Michigan, was an industry leader, not only in supplying plastic products to businesses but also by introducing its first major consumer product, Saran Wrap, in 1953. Plastic packaging allowed grocers to sell smaller portions at lower prices, and consumers to store food more efficiently and effectively. One study estimates that the modern system of packaging lowers the price of beef by about 40 cents a pound, while improving its quality.
<p>	Furthermore, the use of plastic and other types of packaging for foods seems to have reduced, not increased, total household waste. When Rathje took his garbage-archeology team to Mexico City in 1990, they found that the average household there discarded 40 percent more refuse each day than the average U.S. household, because Mexicans ate more whole fruits and vegetables and thus had more rinds, peels, and other food debris. In America, food processors sell prepackaged fruits and vegetables in cans, bags, or microwaveable plastic containers. From an environmental standpoint, this has the effect of accumulating the food debris in a central location, thus making it easier to dispose of in the form of compost, animal feed, and other products.
<p>	Today, the American plastics industry is one of the most innovative in the world. By finding new ways to manufacture, package, and store products that cost less, last longer, require fewer resources, and reduce harm to the environment, the industry is constantly improving the way we live. Since World War II, innovations in the manufacture, design, and use of plastics have yielded tremendous benefits for the public in terms of safety, health, economy, and quality of life. Consider these examples:
<p>	Plastic tubing made possible the first disposable, ready-to-use hypodermic needles. Initially introduced for combat use in the 1940s, the disposable needle soon made it possible to conduct safe and effective mass inoculations against disease in America and throughout the world.
<p>	In 1945, Earl Tupper introduced the first flexible plastic storage containers to replace glass, earthenware, and metal containers for storing food and other perishables. His product, Tupperware, vastly improved the freshness and quality of stored food.
<p>	Plastic siphon tubing made mass irrigation possible in the 1940s and 1950s, thus contributing to the Green Revolution that increased agricultural productivity and eliminated famine in much of the world. In the 1960s, plastic pipes began to replace other forms of piping for water distribution and drainage, because they were lighter and easier to install and resisted corrosion better than alternatives.
<p>	Plastic innovations during the past three decades by such companies as Phillips Petroleum, Union Carbide, and Shell Chemical have made possible such life-saving and life-enhancing products as artificial organs, comfortable prosthetics, body armor for law-enforcement personnel, unbreakable but light children's toys, and many automotive parts.
<p>	Cheap, all-temperature performance, flame-retardant, high-impact-resistant plastic parts made the first home computers -- manufactured by Apple Computer and Tandy -- viable products.
<p>	Lingering environmental controversies such as the risks of dioxin -- which many view as a potent human carcinogen -- are being resolved by plastic designers who, just in the past few years, have developed products that reduce or eliminate these real or perceived environmental problems. GE Plastics, for example, developed a new flame-retardant product that doesn't produce dioxin and that is also easier to make and costs no more than the plastic it replaces. Apple Computer is using the product in its Macintosh line of personal computers. Waste-to-energy plants, which dispose of about 60,000 tons of refuse each day and supply electricity to nearly a million Americans, also employ a series of technologies that reduce dioxin emissions to almost immeasurable levels.
<p>
<b>The Recycling Conundrum</b>
<p>	An article of faith among environmental advocates is that recycling will help American business conserve natural resources and demonstrate its environmental responsibility. This assumption doesn't account for the potential costs, including environmental costs, of pursuing recycling regardless of whether it is truly profitable.
<p>	For example, curbside recycling programs usually require more collection trucks. That means more fuel consumption and engine emissions. Some recycling programs produce high volumes of wastewater and use large amounts of energy. When researchers have tried to examine every aspect of the recycling equation -- from energy use to production costs -- they have found that sometimes recycling makes sense from an economic and environmental standpoint, while other times it does not.
<p>	Aluminum cans are a clear example of a commercial package that should be recycled. It takes 10 percent less energy to recycle aluminum than it does to make it from mined bauxite. So aluminum recycling is profitable -- and commonplace. Steel is also relatively economical to recycle. Virtually all products made with steel contain at least 25 percent reclaimed steel. On the other hand, recycling fruit-juice containers probably doesn't make economic or ecological sense. Filling disposable cardboard boxes takes half as much energy as filling recyclable glass bottles. For a given beverage volume, transporting the empty glass bottles requires 15 times as many trucks as does transporting disposable boxes. Transporting the containers once they are filled also costs less when using disposable boxes. Juice boxes don't break like glass bottles can, they are easily packed or frozen, and they seem to encourage juice consumption among the young, with whom they have proven to be popular.
<p>	For some commodities, such as newsprint, it seems that the only way to make recycling profitable is to force manufacturers to use them. Many states have laws requiring that newspapers contain a certain percentage of recycled paper, thus artificially creating a demand for newsprint. Even mandates sometimes fail to make recycling work: In Germany, laws requiring plastics recycling have resulted in a glut of collected plastics with few economical uses. Advocates for such laws point out that market prices don't capture all the costs of alternatives to recycling. But prices nevertheless contain important information. When forest stocks become scarcer, for example, the price of virgin timber rises, thus making recyclables more attractive. Similarly, as long as landfills are run to at least break even, then as they fill up their tipping fees will rise, again encouraging diversion of waste products into recycling or reuse. These price mechanisms already exist to a significant degree, and yet paper and plastic recycling often makes no sense absent government mandates.	

<p>For corporate managers trying to make heads or tails of the economic and environmental issues surrounding recycling, the answer may well be to trust an imperfect system of market prices over an even more imperfect attempt to guess at the ecological impact of various waste-reduction and recycling strategies. In everyday decisionmaking, this means weighing costs and benefits while maximizing shareholder return.
<p>

	Ford saved millions in 1994 when it converted several components of its automobiles into 100 percent recycled plastic. Chrysler is using completely recycled plastic in the interior trim of its popular minivans. Both car companies have made increasing use of these recycled plastics, made by companies such as Washington Penn Plastics and AlliedSignal, because of their cost and performance advantages over "virgin" plastic, not because of an attempt to meet some vague environmental goal. The savings "go straight to the bottom line," said Tony Brooks, Ford's special recycling coordinator. "Ford's position is that we will do everything we can to use recycled materials in our cars, but they can't cost more than virgin and they must perform at least as well as virgin."
<p>
<b>Problem, Innovation, Solution</b>
<p>	Most environmental issues in America today represent not only public-sector controversies but also private-sector opportunities. For companies that can identify a problem and devise a solution, the potential profits are significant.
<p>	In the case of plastics, profit-seeking corporations are experimenting with edible food packaging that offers better protection, lower cost, and few environmental considerations. ConAgra, Inc., the processed-food giant, is working on an edible bag in which to package products such as frozen entrees that currently used plastic bags. "If you could make a boilable, edible bag, you could replace the plastic with something that is part of the food -- ultimately eliminating a source of package waste," says the company's packaging director, Brian Hopkins. Other companies are working along similar lines. Quaker Oats is testing edible coating for breakfast cereals. RJR Nabisco is working on a film made from milk protein that could be used to coat frozen fish products and baked goods.
<p>	These innovations aren't being pursued simply to reduce package waste. Food manufacturers also want to improve food preservation to enhance the taste and freshness of their products. Instead of having consumers buy whole fruits and vegetables, for example, and then slicing or dicing them at home, manufacturers could prepare large quantities of fresh produce -- such as pre-sliced onions or oranges -- and then preserve them with edible coatings. The cost of the foods would be lower, consumers could enjoy the convenience of pre-sliced ingredients, and waste peelings -- currently spread out over the entire population of homes -- would be centralized in manufacturing facilities and thus easier to dispose of. The resulting boon to human health would be significant. "Consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables could be higher if this service were provided," says Attila E. Pavlath, a food scientist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
<p>Other corporations are focusing their innovative energies on hazardous waste spills, hoping to profit from creative solutions to this most serious of environmental dangers. Whether it is the Exxon Valdez oil spill of 1989 or Superfund sites or underground leakage of cancer-causing chemicals, the topic of hazardous waste often generates passionate feelings and great concern about environmental damage. But is the answer to spills to be found in banning substances or jawboning industry to reduce its dependency on them? Many entrepreneurial U.S. companies say no.

<p>The answer, they suggest, is to find new ways to clean up spills quickly, easily, and effectively. Bioremediation -- using bacteria or fungi either found in nature or engineered in laboratories to clean up hazardous wastes -- is a promising technology that offers the prospect of a cleaner economy without sacrificing the modern industrial processes that make our so economy productive. In Seattle, UNOCAL is using petroleum-eating bacteria to clean a six-acre patch of dirt where an oily residue of gasoline and disease fuels had accumulated over 65 years of leaks from its Seattle Marketing Fuel Terminal. Once the site is clean, UNOCAL expects to sell it for a significant price to commercial or residential developers.
<p>	Bioremediation isn't exactly a new idea -- municipal water systems have long used bacteria to purify sewage and paper companies have used them to remove organic matter from industrial sludgesbut a bustling new industry of bioremediation enterprises promises to clean up such hazardous materials as DDT, wood preservatives, toxic petrochemicals, and radioactive waste. Corporate pioneers in the area include Amoco and Du Pont, but most of the new technologies are coming from small, start-up firms such as Remediation Technologies of Concord, Massachusetts, Alpha Environmental in Austin, Texas, and Envirogen of Lawrenceville, New Jersey. Ironically, many bioremediation approaches have come from a close observation of how Mother Nature herself deals with waste. In searching for microbes to clean up oil spills, Alpha Environmental president Eugene Douglas said, "we went to where there are natural oil seeps in the Mediterranean, Central Asia, and North America, but where there isn't what you'd call pollution. Over time, microbes at these sites have evolved the ability to ingest that oil."
<p>	Bioremediation isn't the only solution profit-seeking corporations are working on. For the problem of oil spills, for example, Sea Sweep, Inc. of Denver, Colorado has developed an oil-absorbing, floating material, made from heating sawdust and woodchips, that will absorb 3.5 times its weight in oil. If administered to a spill, Sea Sweep will absorb the oil and then float to the surface for easy collection, after which it can be burned as fuel. Wyoming-based Centech has developed a centrifuge that generates relatively clean water and marketable oil from oil sludge, which is a serious problem around crude oil storage tanks and pipelines. In the area of industrial wastes, Tennessee's Olin Corp. has developed a process for dramatically reducing absorbable organic halides (such as dioxin) from the paper pulp-bleaching process. Martin Marietta Energy Systems, Inc. has a process for dechlorinating wastewater streams.
<p>	It would be impossible to list all of the environmental innovations and inventions one can find in just a single year, ranging from simple reuse technologies at plant sites to machines and acids that remove virtually all known pollutants from energy plant emissions. Some of these technologies have been developed, as Gore suggests, in response to regulatory mandates. Others have come about as companies seek to reduce their waste disposal costs, improve the efficiency of their production processes, or find new areas of opportunity in a growing, constantly changing economy. It is through innovation and productivity gains, not through corporate munificence or a commitment to a theoretical environmental ethos, that American business will make its most important contribution to a cleaner world and the health and safety of the public. 
<p>	For corporate decisionmakers, true responsibility entails a recognition of the uncertainty that often accompanies environmental controversies and an unwillingness to put the interests of shareholders at risk by accepting environmental "truisms" at face value. It is by no means clear that simply recycling more, or substituting paper for plastic, or abandoning profitable enterprises because they require nonrenewable resources will necessarily serve environmental ends. Ultimately, such ends are determined and valued by human beings who also value healthful and reasonably priced foods, high-quality consumer goods, and job opportunities. The chances of making a poor decision are higher when corporate managers try to act like public policymakers or conservation experts.
<p>	Instead, as much as is practicable, corporations should let prices guide their decisions. In most cases, wasteful industrial practices impose measurable costs on firms, be they for waste disposal, raw-materials purchases, or lost customer revenue. Thus firms have every incentive to find alternatives. "For all environmental issues, shareholder value, rather than compliance, emissions, or costs, is the critical unifying metric," said McKinsey & Co. management consultants Noah Walley and Bradley Whitehead in their noted 1994 essay on corporate environmentalism in the <i>Harvard Business Review</i>. "That approach is environmentally sound, but it's also hardheaded, informed by business experience, and, as a result, much more likely to be truly sustainable over the long term."
<p>	An example of how truly responsible companies might make decisions about environmental issues is the case of Eco-Foam pellets, a substitute for Styrofoam peanuts in packing boxes or other containers. Texas-based American Excelsior Co. makes Eco-Foam out of corn starch and markets it as environmentally friendly. "The biggest benefit is that it's manufactured from renewable resources instead of petroleum products," says one local distributor. Should responsible companies concerned about the global environment use Eco-Foam instead of Styrofoam, then? Probably not. Managers need not evaluate all the pros and cons of the two products. They need only watch the price. In early 1995, Eco-Foam cost 25 percent more than Styrofoam. If we ever really start running out of oil, the price of petroleum products, including Styrofoam, will rise -- making alternatives competitive. Until then, the environmental benefits of switching to corn starch won't be worth the cost.
<p>	Public policymakers will continue to develop more efficient ways to regulate waste and pollution, and scientists will continue to gather information about the environmental risks from various substances or practices. As they do, pricing structures will evolve that communicate even more accurate information to manufacturers and entrepreneurs about the true cost of commercial activities and the potential rewards from innovative solutions to environmental problems.
<p>	There are many promising trends in environmental thinking and regulatory policy, from markets for emissions permits to the increased use of cost-benefit analysis to establish public priorities. Once ecological and economic ends are brought closer together, the perceived clash of interests between American business and Mother Nature will largely disappear. For corporations, the complex issues of environmental responsibility will always be challenging. But dealing with them requires no redefinition of the core profit-seeking purpose of economic enterprises.

<b>Policy Review</b><br>
<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</i></center><p>
	Two competing paradigms of education reform have emerged in the United States in recent years, and the differences between them are growing sharper. One, commonly termed "systemic reform," assumes that reform efforts should be led by government and imposed from the top down. Its advocates believe that state (or federal) authorities must set standards not only for student learning, but also for teacher training, pupil assessments, textbooks, and school resources. Though undertaken in pursuit of higher standards and better results, systemic reform relies on uniform strategies to ensure that "inputs" everywhere are equal and all schools undertake similar activities. Government resources and bureaucratic regulation are, of course, its preferred mechanism for making this happen. Much of Goals 2000 embodies this approach.<p>	The second reform paradigm, which we call "reinventing education," embraces decentralized control, entrepreneurial management, and grassroots initiatives, all within a framework of publicly defined standards and accountability. Under this approach, public officials establish standards, make assessments, and hold schools accountable for meeting performance goals but do not themselves run the schools. Public officials also retain the power to cancel charters and school-management contracts on grounds of consistently poor performance, but they do not directly supervise or control the means by which schools pursue those ends.<p>	Under this paradigm, education may be delivered through charter schools (licensed by public authorities such as a state, city, or local school district), "opt out" schools that secede from their local education agencies and run themselves with what amounts to a "block grant" of public funds, "contract schools" (in which a performance contract is negotiated between private educational managers and a public agency), and "choice" programs (in which students use scholarships or publicly-funded vouchers to attend the schools of their choice). In all such situations, the continuing responsibility of public authorities is to establish standards for educational and fiscal performance and monitor progress in relation to those standards. (Those who reject this degree of public accountability may, of course, turn to wholly private schools or home schooling.)<p>	The "reinvention" approach welcomes diverse strategies and schools organized and run by various entities such as teacher cooperatives, parent associations, private corporations, religious institutions, and community-based organizations. It assumes that students and families are different and should be free to match themselves to the schools that suit them best. It requires little bureaucracy and few regulations because it rejects the proposition that schools must be centrally managed according to a single formula.<p>	We strongly favor the "reinvention" paradigm, provided that it contains one key element borrowed from the "systemic" approach: standards and accountability. It is our conviction that only clear and high standards for performance will ensure accountability, both to the marketplace (that is, to families making informed choices among schools) and to whatever public body authorizes the schools to operate.<p>	These standards need not be national, they need not be highly detailed, they should not prescribe pedagogy or resource use, and they need not cover the entire curriculum. (Indeed, the ability of schools to add their own features to the "core" described in the standards is part of what will make them different from one another.) But only when such standards are in place -- and accompanied by good tests and a steady flow of performance information -- can parents make informed choices among schools and public authorities determine which schools deserve to retain their "charters," contracts, or accreditations.<p>	These two approaches are now competing with each other, not only in Washington, D.C., but also in the states. Systemic reform remains the favored strategy of the Clinton administration and of some educators (especially in state departments of education and teachers unions), but the "reinvention" alternative is preferred in many other quarters -- including by many elected officials, business leaders, and parents, as well as by teachers and principals who welcome the possibility of breaking free from the stifling grip of bureaucracy. <p>	The reinvention impulse has even reached Capitol Hill, where the past year saw stirrings of the first major push in memory to "devolve" centralized activities to states, communities, and families and to lift restrictions on the use of federal aid. This impulse arises partly from the quest for better education, but also from a reaction against the regulatory burden of federal regulations and unfunded mandates.<p>	This is the motive behind recent congressional activity concerning "block grants" in areas as diverse as welfare, school lunches, and job training, as well as education aid. To be sure, turning categorical programs into block grants and devolving control to states and communities will not automatically foster reinvention. Indeed, recipients may not do much of anything. But doing away with "Washington-knows-best" approaches and removing strings from federal dollars at least permits reform-minded states and communities to experiment with new strategies for education and other public servicesand closes the easy route of blaming Uncle Sam for poor results.<p>	The federal government is so hamstrung by special interest groups that getting it out of the way of change-minded states and communities may be the most we can expect from Washington on the "reinvention" front. Certainly, all efforts by Uncle Sam to foster such reforms directly have proven halfhearted at best and fraudulent at worst. The so-called "Improving America's Schools Act" of 1994, for example, banned any use of federal aid for privately managed public schools and created a school "choice" program so laden with preconditions and constraints that it must be termed phony. It enables members of Congress to say they "voted for school choice" while ensuring that there is none.<p>	Even rigorous accountability based on testing was discouraged by explicit prohibitions in the Goals 2000 legislation on the use of federal funds for this purpose. Those who believe that such reforms are the main hope for serious educational improvement are learning that Washington is the wrong place to look. But much is happening elsewhere in the nation under the "reinvention" banner.
<p><b>Potemkin Charters</b><p>	The charter school idea has picked up tremendous momentum, as have variants, such as a flock of new, miniature high schools in New York City that are not called charters but share many of their characteristics. Those qualities include a large measure of operational independence from headquarters in return for a promise to achieve certain results over a stated period of time. (New York City's quasi-charters, however, have not agreed to any educational performance goals, and their quasi-independence relies on waivers by the local teachers union, waivers that do not even apply to the schools' many other employees.)<p>	By summer 1995, 19 states had enacted explicit "charter" school laws, including eight during the most recent legislative session (Louisiana, Arkansas, New Hampshire, Texas, Alaska, Wyoming, Delaware, and Rhode Island). Several hundred such schools were scheduled to be open this fall. Charter schools are no panacea -- not in a country with 85,000 public schools -- but this movement is the second-most-exciting development on the educational reform front.<p>	Not all charter laws are created equal, however, and several enacted in recent months are so weak that they are unlikely to do much good. We think of them as "Potemkin" charter programs with an impressive facade but no substance. Some of these laws were supported by people who actually oppose charter schools on principle and had decided to undermine support for them by promoting a bill that pretended to create them. This is currently happening in New Jersey, where the state teachers union is supporting a weak charter bill in the state assembly, although a stronger, competing bill supported by the state education commissioner, the state senate, and Governor Christine Whitman may yet prevail.<p>	Weak charter laws generally suffer from at least one of three serious failings:<p><ul><li>	They require the prior assent of too many "stakeholders," such as a majority of teachers currently teaching in the affected schools, and contain no mechanism for creating new charter schools that do not already possess such stakeholders. Of course, it would be wonderful if existing schools converted to charter status with the support of a majority of teachers and parents working together, and that is sure to happen in some places. But there are also situations in which parents and community leaders want to start a new school, and they should be allowed to do sowith the staff they want to teach in it. (Currently, California's charter law requires the approval of a majority of teachers, as do those in Georgia, Hawaii, and New Mexico.)<p>
<li>	They place local school boards in sole charge of granting charters. (Wyoming, Louisiana, and Texas have recently enacted such laws.) Though such a limitation is invariably a key political goal of school board lobbyists, it can be fatal for charter schools, because the uniform policies of a benighted local board and risk-averse superintendent are usually what charter-seekers are keenest to escape. That is why strong charter laws either lodge the authority to issue charters with a different entity (such as a state superintendent or state board) or -- better yet -- create multiple windows or appeal mechanisms so that no single entity has the absolute power to deny a charter application. In Michigan and Minnesota, state universities have the authority to issue charters. In Arizona, besides vesting this authority in both local and state school boards, the legislature created a new "charter school" board exclusively for this purpose<p>.<li>	They neglect to exempt charter schools from enough of the statutes, regulations, and contractual provisions that burden conventional schools. Thus, the charter school is not truly free to chart its own course. The whole point of such a school, after all, is to gain autonomy of action in return for accountability for results. The only regulations that charter schools should be expected to comply with are those governing health and safety and protections against racial discrimination. But many states leave numerous other rules in place. If a state still requires that U.S. history be taught in the 11th grade, that a school's pupil-teacher ratio cannot exceed 25:1, that 40 minutes a day must be spent on math, that certain textbooks must be purchased, and if there is no respite from seniority rules, salary schedules, or tenure requirements, then we see little point in calling an entity so regulated a "charter school." Such a charter is unlikely to be worth the paper it is printed on -- and few will go to the bother of seeking such a document.</ul><p>
	Why have so many states created these Potemkin charter programs? The explanation, of course, has to do with power and politics, catalyzed by the education establishment's fierce resistance to changes that threaten its monopoly. Though many teachers and principals crave opportunities to "opt out" of the system and run their own schools without the incessant oversight, time-wasting regulations, and innumerable mandates of the bureaucracy, their professional organizations seldom see it this way. Thus teachers unions, school-board associations, and superintendents, if they cannot defeat the charter bill altogether, generally do their utmost to weaken it. So do other advocacy groupsfor example, special educationwhose stock-in-trade is rule-bound uniformity rather than diversity. In fact, the Southwest Regional Laboratory recently leveled a novel criticism: that charter schoolsprecisely because many of them demand a high degree of parent involvementare unfair to children with bad parents!<p>	Obtaining a charter does not end the hazards that await these schools. Most also encounter practical problems when they first launch. One perennial challenge is finding a place to operate a charter school. To our knowledge, no state provides charter operators with buildings or capital financing. Though this is no huge burden for existing schools that convert to charter status, it poses a great obstacle to the creation of new charter schools. Another problem is that many charter school founders and managers have little prior experience in matters such as financial management, purchasing, and marketing.<p>	Our hunch, however, is that these are birthing and growing pains associated with a feisty, infant reform strategy that will, in time, turn into a strapping youth. We doubt that opponents will be able to halt its growth. In England, where "grant-maintained" schools have been in place for several years -- and where almost a fifth of all secondary schools have "opted out" into this independent status -- even the Labor Party is having to come to terms with their continued existence. Indeed, party leader Tony Blair now sends his own child to a grant-maintained school.<p><b>Gains for School Choice</b>
<p>	There was major progress on the choice front in 1994-95, centering on Milwaukee and Cleveland. In Wisconsin, Governor Tommy Thompson succeeded in persuading the legislature to pass his proposal to expand Milwaukee's voucher experiment to include many more children and to permit attendance at church-affiliated schools. As revised, and assuming the courts eventually assent, up to 15,000 low-income Milwaukee children (nearly all of them minority) will be able to attend any school within the city limits.<p>	In Ohio, the legislature agreed to a proposal by Governor George Voinovich to initiate a voucher "pilot" in 1996 for children in Cleveland. That city's catastrophically bad school system was "taken over" by the state under a federal court order in early 1995. Here, too, church-affiliated schools will be eligible recipients of voucher-bearing youngsters -- up to 2,000 of them. And here, too, the primary beneficiaries of this reform will be low-income minority youngsters.<p>	Court battles have already begun, and we do not doubt that choice's foes, having lost two significant political battles, will now throw vast resources into the effort to get vouchers thrown out as a violation of the "Establishment Clause" of the First Amendment. In August, the Wisconsin Supreme Court issued a temporary injunction against the Milwaukee plan. But the governors and legislators of Wisconsin and Ohio deserve hearty applause from those who believe, as we do, that no child should be forced to attend a bad public school against his and his parents' will when a better school -- public, private, or hybrid -- is available close by. Because the families of poor children often lack the wherewithal to exercise such a choice on their own, it is the obligation of elected officials to make it possible for them, as they have historically done in higher education. That this will now happen in two major U.S. cities is a development of immense significance to American education. <p>	A number of other states stepped up to the "choice" plate in 1995 but struck out. In Texas, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Illinois, and Arizona, variations on the voucher theme failed to pass, and New Jersey delayed consideration of Mayor Bret Schundler's Jersey City plan until at least autumn of this year. The original Ohio choice bill, to encompass a broader area than Cleveland, was chopped down by the legislature. Another setback was the ruling by Puerto Rico's Supreme Court that the voucher program there violated the commonwealth's constitution.<p>	Nothing, of course, elicits tougher opposition from defenders of the public-school status quo than voucher schemes (and similar ventures that go by different names), even when such plans are aimed precisely at those disadvantaged children who are most likely to drop out of public school. But the idea is not going away. Meanwhile, privately-funded voucher projects also continue to multiply, from New York's Student/Sponsor Partnership, to the Golden Rule program launched in Indianapolis in 1991. Today 23 programs reach more than 10,000 students. <p>	We believe that it is just a matter of time before children from needy families in most parts of the country will be able to carry their vouchers (or scholarships or whatever they may be called) to any accredited school. We understand that some private schools fear government regulation, and may decline to participate. We recognize that public aid should be targeted toward those students in greatest need (as is now the case in higher education); and we acknowledge that the Supreme Court will have to sort through the constitutional questions posed by inclusion of parochial schools. (Recent Supreme Court decisions in this domain have encouraged voucher supporters.)<p>	Still, it must be noted that, in the meantime, primary and secondary schooling is becoming increasingly anomalous as vouchers come to prevail in most other domains of U.S. domestic policy. Even President Clinton has endorsed vouchers in job training and in public housing. Moreover, much of the rest of the world -- from Australia to Chile to the Netherlands -- treats publicly-subsidized private-school attendance as routine and normal.<p><b>Contract Management</b><p>
	Paul Hill's superb new book <i>Reinventing Public Education</i> sets forth a comprehensive vision of how this approach could work in the future -- and why it is apt to work better than direct operation of all schools by the school system's central office. Meanwhile, Educational Alternatives, Inc. (EAI) continues to manage a number of schools in Baltimore and recently added Hartford, Connecticut, to its portfolio. The superintendent of schools in the District of Columbia has tried to revive his plan to engage EAI to run some of D.C.'s troubled schools. A private management firm is functioning as "superintendent of schools" in Minneapolis.<p>The Edison Project opened its first four schools in 1995, with others due to follow if these succeed. And at least two other companies are already active in this field in the United States. Sabis is an international group that has been running a school in Minnesota and recently added a second (charter) school in Springfield, Massachusetts. Nashville-based Alternative Public School Strategies has reached an agreement with little Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, to run one of three elementary schools in that community -- a school in which 78 percent of students receive free or reduced-price lunches. (The future of this contract, however, is shadowed by ambiguity in the laws of Pennsylvania as to the legality of such an arrangement.) More companies and communities will surely follow, probably including big corporate guns such as Disney, which is creating a school in Florida that many view as a prototype.<p>	Unfortunately, not all the blossoms in this garden are healthy. EAI's relationship with a school in Dade County, Florida, has ended. Baltimore mayor Kurt Schmoke -- whose strong support is the main reason EAI has been able to withstand intense establishment pressure in that city -- has voiced dissatisfaction with student performance in the EAI-run schools after three years and has suggested that the arrangement may need to be rethought. And EAI's bold plan to alter budget priorities in Hartford kicked up such a storm from vested interests -- imagine shifting funds from surplus staff to areas such as technologythat the company and school board have decided to scale back most of the changes, at least for now, from the entire district to six schools that have "volunteered" for the full treatment. <p>	The difficulties of EAI in Baltimore and Hartford suggest that contracting will probably work best with new schools and with existing schools that are receptive. It is difficult to graft a new management program onto a school whose staff is determined to defeat the new managers. Perhaps private management should begin with a single school or manageable number of schools that want to be changed. Otherwise, the new managers will be forced to maintain all the elements of a system that currently does not work for children. And if they do, they will be doomed to fail.<p>	As for Edison, there is incredible pressure on its first four schools to be nearly perfect -- educationally, organizationally, and budgetarily -- from the very outset. The venture's future hinges on how well it meets these immense expectations. Every education journalist and researcher in the Western world is knocking on the Edison schools' door, probing for defects or missteps. No conventionally-run public school in America is likely to be subjected to the same degree of scrutiny or held to the same standards of perfection.<p>	In our view, contract management of public schools holds considerable promise, and these trials should be encouraged. We should also expect bumps along the road as these schools get their bearings; some may even fail. It is well to bear in mind, however, that we currently keep failing public schools open and even reward them when they should be closed down. Therefore, when a poorly run contract school or charter school is terminated, we should see such an action as a victory rather than a setback for the reinvention strategy. If and when that happens, it will prove that school authorities are willing to be held accountable for poor results.<p>	Meanwhile, beware the word "privatization," which is widely used by supporters of the current system to block all movement toward contract management. True "privatization" means selling or otherwise transferring a public asset to private owners who henceforth bear sole responsibility for its existence and are accountable to no one save their shareholders.<p>	That is what is happening to certain big, state-run factories in Eastern Europe, for example, but it is not what firms such as EAI and Edison are doing with the U.S. schools they manage under contract. Those schools remain public in every sense that a student, parent, taxpayer, or voter could think important: They are open to the public, financed by the public, and educationally and fiscally accountable to public authorities for their continued existence (and for the retention or termination of their private managers). Here is a sure test of whether an organization has been privatized: If public authorities can cancel the contract or withdraw the charter, the transaction is not privatization. It is a management contract on behalf of the public, not a transfer of public goods to private ownership.<p><b>Governance Changes</b><p>	The century-old governance structure of American public education is showing signs of change. As a recent <i>Education Week</i> headline put it, "Fervor spreads to overhaul state agencies."<p>	This year, it appears, 30 states carried out or at least considered reorganization or reduction of their education departments, mirroring the popular political trends of reducing government, pushing authority to local officials, and giving power to the elected officials whom the voters are apt to hold responsible at the polls for the effective use of their tax dollars. (Education spending is the largest or second-largest budget item in every state.)<p>	Texas offers a dramatic example. Now the second most populous state, Texas has been long known to have perhaps the most highly regulated school system in the country, with an immensely detailed education code and an all-powerful state education agency. Early this year, the legislature agreed with Governor George W. Bush Jr. that significant changes were needed. In effect, they repealed the entire education code and started afresh.<p>	The authority of the Texas Education Agency has been limited to six basic functions, including recommending education goals, granting campus charters, managing school funds, and administering federal programs. Several new categories of schools and school systems have been authorized, including "home rule" districts that are freed from most state mandates and charter schools that may be organized by individuals or groups outside the existing school system. (Unfortunately, as we noted earlier, almost all Texas charters must be issued by the local school board, and these boards are not likely to welcome dissenting approaches.) Texas also created a new network of alternative schools and made it easier to remove disruptive students from regular classrooms. And it created a powerful new state board for educator certification, to be named by the governor.<p>	Other states have taken different approaches. Minnesota abolished its department of education and merged these functions into a new department of children, families, and learning. Wisconsin took virtually all duties and powers away from its independently-elected state school superintendent, an office that was widely perceived as a captive of the education establishment, and turned them over to a new agency answerable to the governor. New Jersey's governor "froze" the regulatory process and directed the education commissioner and his colleagues to propose a comprehensive overhaul.North Carolina -- another highly centralized, heavily regulated state -- is shrinking its department of education by half and rewriting laws and regulations to give local districts far greater flexibility. The state has established annual performance standards for the state's almost 2,000 public schools based on "reasonable progress" in reading, writing, and math and with various interventions, sanctions (including suspension of principals and teachers), and rewards for success or failure to meet those standards. In other words, the state is moving from a regulatory compliance strategy to one based on standards and results.<p>	Illinois also made a radical change, though it affects only the city of Chicago, whose troubled and deficit-plagued schools have been the object of innumerable reform efforts in recent years. The legislature gave unprecedented control to the mayor, who has appointed (and can remove) all members of a small newly created "board of trustees" and a management team that includes a chief operating officer and fiscal, purchasing, and educational officers. The new law also places school principals in charge of all school employees (previously they had no authority over custodians) and authorizes them to set their own school hours and staff schedules. The Chicago Teachers Union is barred from bargaining over many nonsalary issues such as class size, staff assignments, academic calendar, hours and places of instruction, pupil assessment policies, privatizing services, and decisions over charter schools. It is also forbidden to strike for the next 18 months.<p><b>Will Unions Get with the Program?</b><p>	Chicago is not the only place where teachers unions have run afoul of public authorities. Largely because of their efforts to block state and local reforms, the unions are coming under more intense scrutiny and challenge. School boards, legislatures, and governors are promulgating policies and proposing legislation to abolish tenure, redefine collective bargaining rights, repeal "fair-share" agreements, and otherwise change laws and practices that sustain union interests and undergird their power.<p>	In Indiana, for example, the "fair share" law has been repealed. This law had authorized unions to extract fees from nonunion members in return for "services" performed for them by the unions, regardless of whether the individuals wanted those services. (An obvious example is a wage increase that affects all teachers in the district.) By repealing this law, the legislature made it illegal for unions to negotiate such arrangements with school districts. In another, more localized blow to the Indiana State Teachers Association, the legislature passed a reform bill for the Indianapolis schools that limits collective bargaining to the issue of wages only in that city. <p>	In neighboring Michigan, the state also erased collective bargaining over certain nonsalary issues, empowered school boards to put teachers' health insurance out for competitive bidding (rather than compelling purchase of this benefit from the Michigan Education Association's insurance subsidiary), instituted steep fines against teachers who go on strike, and forbade the union to deduct political contributions from teachers' paychecks without their permission.<p>	Such developments are apt to continue as long as unions throw sand in the reform gears. When education is reshaped around standards and performance rather than inputs and processes, just about every established routine will be affected, including personnel practices. No aspect of a school's management is more crucial to its effectiveness than how it handles staffing, and nothing is more fatal to performance-based innovation than attempts to preserve staffing rules that disregard performance.<p>	In New York City, for example, the contract with the United Federation of Teachers allows a school, if 75 percent of the staff agrees, to be included in the "school-based option transfer plan," which lets it (among other union-rule waivers) select its own teachers rather than having staff assigned on the basis of seniority. Sixty schools, including most of the struggling new, small high schools, have opted to be included in the program.<p>	In the city's 1,000 other public schools, however, which enroll 99 percent of the children in the system, transfers to vacancies continue to be based strictly on seniority. Junior teachers can be "bumped" by more senior teachers from other schools, no matter how much a school may want the junior teacher or how little it wants the more senior teacher. Such practices, of course, make it impossible for a school's staff to develop its own ethos, which is essential to the staff's effectiveness and its ability to work together as a team with shared goals.<p>	The Educational Excellence Network has had a long history of successful association on important projects with the American Federation of Teachers at the national level, and the authors of this report admire AFT head Albert Shanker's defense of high standards and high stakes, his international work on behalf of democracy, and his good sense about curricula issues. His staff has also produced some terrific products, and several AFT locals have pioneered (or at least tolerated) some promising reform strategies.<p>	At the state and local levels, however, far more often than not, the AFT and NEA are the most potent protectors of the status quo. In principle, they could change, abandoning their tired industrial model of unionism and turning to the flexible, responsibility- and accountability-seeking, participatory, professional approach to organizational behavior that modern organizations need, and that many other organizations have. We do not know whether, if only for self-preservation, they will prove willing and able to take such a step. We certainly hope they will.

<h3>Will Conservative Welfare Reform Corrupt Religious Charities?</h3>
<hr size=3 width=50%>
<b>Amy L. Sherman</b><br>
<b>Policy Review</b><br>
<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</i></center>
<p>	Welfare reform, says Governor John Engler of Michigan, is not "just about reforming a broken system, but about reforming what is broken in the human character." Engler is one of a growing number of policymakers who seek to shift responsibility for helping the poor from government bureaucracies to civil institutions -- particularly religious ones -- that can address the underlying moral and cultural aspects of chronic welfare dependency. Indeed, amidst the flurry of federal and state initiatives to scale back the welfare state, religious nonprofits are becoming the new provider of choice for funding and delivering social programs.<p>Engler has approved a multimillion-dollar contract with the Salvation Army to care for the state's homeless population. Mississippi governor Kirk Fordice has established a "Faith and Families" project in which state social-service agencies work with churches to "adopt" welfare families. The federal government provides some 350 grant programs for social-service nonprofits, many of them with religious roots. U.S. Senators John Ashcroft and Dan Coats have proposed legislation allowing individuals a dollar-for-dollar tax credit for donations made to charities, including religious groups, that serve the poor.<p>The enthusiasm for religion-based providers is well-deserved. Christian-based substance-abuse recovery programs, for example, reportedly boast a 70 to 80 percent success rate, whereas secular therapeutic programs report an average success rate of 6 to 10 percent. Research by Roger Freeman of Harvard University shows that black inner-city youth who attend church are 47 percent less likely to drop out of school, 54 percent less likely to use drugs, and 50 percent less likely to engage in criminal activities than those without religious values. Columnist William Raspberry of the <i>Washington Post</i> recently asserted that the most successful social programs "are those that are driven -- even if only tacitly -- by moral or religious values."<p>So it's beginning to look like th
e secular state wants some old-time religion. But what impact will increased state funding have on religion-based programs? Will more money allow them to help more needy people, or will it dilute -- or pollute -- their ability to exert the moral and spiritual influence that makes them uniquely successful? <p>In Michigan, where Engler has aggressively collaborated with religious nonprofits, the results are mixed. State agencies tend to treat these nonprofits not as equals, but as subcontracting functionaries doing the government's bidding. State contracts almost always come with conditions -- regulations that sometimes diminish a religious group's best assets: its personal involvement, its credibility with the community, and its commitment to addressing not only physical needs but spiritual ones as well<p>Moreover, religious nonprofits that contract with the state may, as a result, shift their purpose from the transformation of lives to the mere delivery of services. The most effective groups challenge those who embrace faith to live out its moral implications in every significant area of their lives, from breaking drug or alcohol addictions and repairing family relationships to recommitting themselves to the value of honest work. But state social-service contracts aren't mainly concerned with such outcomes; they focus on the number of meals served, beds available, and checks cashed. <p>
<b>Engler Calls in the Army</b><p>The aim of his welfare-reform efforts, Engler says, is to smash the entitlement mentality, promote the idea that aid entails responsibility, and empower the private sector (particularly the religious community) to deliver welfare services. To accomplish the first two goals, Michigan in 1992 began requiring recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) to sign a "social contract" with the state that committed them to work, job training, or volunteer service for at least 20 hours per week. To accomplish the third goal, Engler has increased collaboration with and funding of religiously based social-service groups.<p>Some public-private partnerships in the state are still too young to afford solid conclusions about their effects. Nonetheless, the most formal and visible partnership in social welfare in Michigan -- the state's annual $9.5 million contract with the Salvation Army to assist the homeless -- sheds some light on the deficiencies of public-private collaboration.<p>In December 1991, the Michigan Department of Social Services (DSS) awarded the Salvation Army a $3 million grant to provide emergency shelter and two meals per day to homeless individuals, either in its own facilities or by "subcontracting" with other private shelter operators. The partnership resulted from the expectation that homelessness would increase following Engler's most dramatic welfare reform: terminating the state's General Assistance (GA) program. Until October 1991, the GA program had provided about $240 million annually to childless, able-bodied, nonworking adults. Critics charged that without assistance, many of these individuals would become homeless. State officials wanted an inexpensive but effective initiative to prepare for such a contingency.<p>	The scale of this partnership is impressive. In the first year, the Army provided over 680,000 "nights of service" (a bed and a meal) to the state's homeless. The initial grant of $3 million has increased each year to reach $9.5 mi
llion in 1995. This works out to $10 per day per client and allows the Army a modest administrative overhead of 3 percent. From the time GA was terminated until March of this year, the Army and its subcontractors provided nearly 2.9 million nights of service to homeless individuals.<p>	From the state's perspective, this partnership has been, in the words of Rusty Hills, Engler's public-affairs director, "absolutely magnificent." In one fell swoop, Engler saved the taxpayers millions of dollars, dealt a significant blow to the entitlement culture, encouraged thousands of individuals to leave the dole and find jobs, and provided homeless people food and shelter far more cost-effectively than ever before. Despite the increase in homelessness that followed the GA cuts, state officials say, the Army and its subcontractors have risen to the challenge. Shirley Nowakowski, the director of energy, housing, and emergency programs for Michigan's DSS, says the Salvation Army partnership is a success because "everyone who wants a bed has a bed." Jerry Miller, the state's director of social services, agrees, noting that the Salvation Army is providing services far more cheaply than the state could.<p>	Leonard Krugel, the Army's director of divisional services and the point man in the Army's contract with the state, is also pleased with the collaboration. He explains that the Army would have had to confront an increased homeless population anyway, and having state dollars helped pay the bills. More importantly, Krugel argues that the partnership has provided the Army "regulatory relief." <p>	For example, city officials in Detroit recently passed a new ordinance requiring homeless shelters to provide, among other things, dietitian-approved menus, quiet study rooms for schoolchildren, and expensive fire-suppression sprinkler systems. The ordinance already has put some private shelter operators out of business, and critics say the regulations are excessive and unrealistic. But for the Army, Krugel explains, "all of [these reg
ulations] are outside the sphere of this contract."Just Send the Checks?<p>	Former Army staffers and outside observers, however, are less sanguine about the partnership. The Army has a long history of providing emergency shelter. But it also knows a lot about how to help the homeless break the cycle of dependency. Salvation Army chapters in Michigan offer drug rehabilitation programs, educational services, and job-training seminars. Nearly every Army center has a chapel on site, and Bible study classes and spiritual support groups are common. <p>   The state contract, however, is limited to emergency services only. It includes neither the practical nor spiritual functions that have distinguished the Army over the years. With state-supplied funds, the Army subcontracts with shelters and certifies that they meet minimum standards of health and safety and provide the basic services of food and shelter. The Army neither provides consulting services to the subcontracting shelters nor assists them in designing programs to serve the homeless. It simply acts as a conduit for state funds, distributing money to 116 shelters (including religion-based ones) throughout the state.<p>	The contract represents an enormous missed opportunity. On the one hand, state officials seemed to focus nearly exclusively on the cost effectiveness of turning over care of the homeless to the Army. On the other hand, Army staffers failed to insist that their emphasis on moral renewal be implemented in participating shelters.<p> 	"The Salvation Army has taken a very myopic approach to its role, that of being a fiduciary -- not a program monitor, just a 'pass through,'" says Dan Piepszowski, the Army's former director of social services in eastern Michigan who is now with the Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit. "I don't think the Army was able to fully integrate their church ministry agenda into the operation of the contract." Piepszowski says, for example, that there has been no clear ministerial role for core officers -- the heart of the Arm
y's religious leadership -- at the shelters. <p>	"They've got to figure out who they are in this collaboration," Piepszowski says. "Do we want to send the checks or do we want to work our magic? They've opted to send the checks."<p>	It appears that the Michigan DSS also had a too-limited vision of what it wanted out of the partnership. Leonard Krugel, for example, does not know why the state chose to work with the Army rather than some other entity. When asked the same question, Shirley Nowakowski of the DSS said that the state selected the Army because it has corporate offices in several Michigan counties. She seemed unaware that the Army, as a religion-based provider, might address moral and behavioral problems underlying chronic homelessness more effectively than typical secular programs. Neither did state welfare director Jerry Miller. He said the fact that the Army is a religious organization never entered his thinking. Rather, according to these officials, they wanted to ensure that every Michigan citizen who needed emergency shelter would get it -- and they believed the Salvation Army could deliver.<p>	Sam Chambers, the director of social services in Wayne County (which includes Detroit), complains that the state was never interested in a genuine partnership in which the Army could pursue its holistic approach to homelessness. "Case planning wasn't part of [the partnership]. Rebuilding people's lives wasn't part of it. . . . All that was bought by the state was direct emergency services -- a 'cot and a hot.'" Critics say the Army's involvement is not helping Michigan transform homeless individuals into productive citizens, but is simply feeding and sheltering a dependent homeless population more efficiently. All that has changed, they maintain, is who signs the checks for the individual shelters.<p><b>The Dole and the Soul</b><p>The drawbacks of state funding go deeper than the loss to welfare recipients of the benefits of a spiritual ministry. The nonprofits themselves risk losing their unique cap
acity to help the needy. For example, a nonprofit's credibility in the eyes of its beneficiaries may be tainted by its association with state agencies. Rev. Eddie Edwards, who oversees a community-development organization in east Detroit called Joy of Jesus, explains: "When we are working with people in the community, helping them become self-sufficient, helping them get off welfare, it would be extremely difficult to tell them to get off welfare if we were on some kind of public assistance."<p>	Other problems, though, exist largely because of the way public-private partnerships are now conducted. The impact of public funds on REACH, Inc., another church-based ministry in Michigan, illustrates several pitfalls into which such groups can stumble.<p>	REACH began as the brainchild of several lay members of Detroit's 12th Street Baptist Church, who started an outreach to senior citizens in the surrounding neighborhood. The group established a day-care center, purchased and rehabilitated crack houses, and even opened up a local restaurant. Rev. Lee Earl pastored the church, and REACH's offices were housed in the church building. As the group's vision for community renewal expanded, some members wanted to pursue government funding. In its early years, church members and private companies had financed the ministry's work. Earl says he was not sure that "the benefits of government funding outweighed the challenges," but his was a minority voice. <p>	In the early 1990s, the church won grants from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Small Business Administration, and the city government to expand its housing-redevelopment efforts and small-business training. But with the dollars came headaches. For one thing, bureaucratic sluggishness delayed their redevelopment program. Earl describes how government bureaucrats held up the processing of contracts because they lacked computer skills. "Their turnaround time might be a month and your turnaround might be a day," Earl says. "But you've got to move by
 their timetable." <p>	Local government officials overseeing REACH's work also lacked "street sense," Earl says. When REACH rehabilitated homes with private money, it negotiated only with the city's building authority. "The building authority was flexible to the realities of rehabbing," he says. "For example, the houses have to have gutters and doors and other parts made of aluminum. But you can't put that stuff on until the house has people in it, because the crack heads will steal the aluminum and sell it for drugs." Building authorities typically approved the inspection as long as the materials were purchased and ready to be put on. Once the home was approved, the family could move in, and church volunteers put on the aluminum within 24 hours. <p>	Once REACH received local, state, and federal funds, other agencies, including the community development department, assumed various responsibilities for oversight. According to Earl, the officials there did not understand the realities of rehabilitation in the inner-city. "They wanted [the aluminum] on the house before they would even come out and inspect it," Earl says. "They said, 'Put it on the house and we'll be out within seven working days.' Well, it wouldn't stay on the house for seven working hours!"<p><b>Up Close and Impersonal</b><p>	One attraction of religion-based social-service groups is that they tend to be more personable than their secular counterparts. Workers in the religion-based providers often come from the local neighborhood and can relate well to clients. Moreover, ministry staff are often volunteers or are underpaid; they are there because they view their work as a calling rather than a job. Nearly everyone in social service agrees that a friendly, supportive environment stimulates improvements in behavior among welfare recipients. Consequently, the "impersonalization" or "bureaucratization" of a ministry can severely undercut its effectiveness.<p>	The process of "impersonalization" unfolds in a variety of ways. Ministries complain th
at government funding brings enormous paperwork that steals time away from face-to-face ministry. In addition, government often dictates that groups receiving public funds hire only staffers with specific educational degrees, such as a masters of social work (M.S.W.), or with certification in professional substance-abuse counseling programs. Such "professionalization" can undermine the informal, relational style that once prevailed between staff and recipients of care.<p>	"Part of the criticism of us now is that we're too professional, too polished; that we can't relate to the things that [local residents] are going through," says Linda Smith, a REACH staff member since its inception. In the organization's early years, says former executive director Charlene Johnson, about 70 to 100 volunteers participated in various aspects of the ministry. Today, REACH's office "volunteers" number three -- all from the federally funded Americorps program. REACH's current director, Pamela Martin Turner, says the organization is "developing personnel policies, formalized job descriptions with job titles and salary ranges, and other things that happen when you become more bureaucratic."<p>	Gary Bayer, who used to oversee a Detroit homeless shelter serving substance abusers, argues that ex-clients who have overcome their addictions make some of the best employees. They have walked the same streets as the drug abusers they now serve; they have the authority to challenge them, and teach them how to get off drugs and stay off them. But under the government's credentialing requirements, such "homegrown" leaders often aren't eligible for employment as counselors.<p>	While credentialing requirements are appropriate in certain kinds of social-service work (no one wants volunteer "doctors" providing them medical care), they may be unnecessary elsewhere. In Detroit, DSS director Sam Chambers and his friends in the religious social-service sector are trying to design more creative programs with a greater role for paraprofessionals and v
olunteers. Unfortunately, such collaboration seems to be exceptional.<p><b>Organizational Drift</b><p>	At its heart, a religion-based service provider aims to transform lives. Such a goal can be difficult to measure by objective, quantitative data. That's why program leaders, when conferring with supporters in the private sector, typically tell stories. Progress in personal transformation is often judged by such things as changed language, faithful attendance in education/training programs, increased punctuality and personal responsibility, willingness to work, improved social relations with staff, reaffiliation with family, avoidance of drugs, commitment to financial accountability, greater reliability, and increasing initiative and enthusiasm. These often intangible and "qualitative" changes are the very ones credited with permanent socioeconomic improvement. <p>	Government, by contrast, focuses on objective statistics, usually to measure the number of commodities provided to a needy person or neighborhood. Consequently, nonprofits receiving government funds start counting numbers and recording statistics. And to ensure continued receipt of state dollars, they may start investing more effort in programs that produce easily quantifiable results rather than in holistic ministry that produces qualitative change.<p>	REACH's Linda Smith reports that the tone of the group's programs has changed. Before receiving major government grants, the ministry emphasized "human development," with great attention to moral and spiritual matters. "Our experience showed that if we didn't do this, we could move people into a house, but they'd trash it and not make the mortgage payments," says former director Johnson. Now the ministry's help is more "commodified" (providing people material goods such as houses) and its work is more project-oriented than relationship-oriented. Under Johnson's tenure, the ministry's largest annual budget was $1 million, distributed across youth, family, and economic-development programs. Today, 
the thrust of REACH's energy is on housing rehabilitation and construction, programs for which they can obtain major federal and state grants. REACH recently secured a $1.7 million grant for a major housing initiative.<p>
"Government funding will not realistically finance your Christian, holistic, or evangelistic purpose. You can't use it for that," says Virgil Gulker, a guru of the religion-based service community who has founded numerous projects in Michigan for the poor. "So you end up evaluating quantitative things -- how many houses did you build, how many meals did you serve, how many jobs did you find -- that will have no impact on your organization's original purposes, other than to diminish that original purpose or mission."<p>
<b>Secularization</b><p>	Gulker's insights touch on the crux of the issue of government funding of religion-based providers: the potential danger of secularization. REACH's current executive director, Pamela Martin Turner, admits quite openly that REACH has "evolved into a more secular, more ecumenical organization than in past years. . . . To some large extent, the work of the past was primarily based on faith, on a commitment to spiritual and religious values. Whereas now, on the staff level, there may be some internal spiritual value that compels people to come to work, but that's not the explicit understanding. People come to work because it's their job and they're expected to do a good job."<p>	The de-emphasis on the spiritual comes with a cost: REACH staffers are less likely to bring their religious convictions to bear in addressing, confronting, and meeting the needs of the needy. "We do not talk about the spiritual needs at all," says Smith. "When we worked out of the church, I knew every day, without a doubt, why I was there." Now, she says, "some days I come to work and people come in and I feel like I can't help them because they need more than to just talk about putting them in a house. It's a struggle for me."<p>	People of faith, of course, are concerned about the threat of secularization. But others ought to be worried as well, for the dilution of a ministry's religious distinctiveness may remove the very element that makes it so effective in addressing social problems. <p>	Even ministries known for their spiritually integrated approach are susceptible. The Detroit-based Joy of Jesus accepts no government funding, but financial problems led it to incorporate a separate, not explicitly religious, nonprofit partner organization called R-3 that solicits state funds. These are used principally in the organization's housing-redevelopment program. The ministry also moved its job training program to R-3 because private donations were insufficient to maintain it. Instructor Kevin Feldman reports that 
he used to integrate biblical principles in the training curriculum and pray with his students, but had to stop once the organization received government funding. In Feldman's view, the result has been that "our success rate has dramatically declined." Fewer individuals are completing the program and fewer are finding and retaining jobs. <P>	After reviewing this ledger of potential pitfalls, some faith-based groups in Michigan have decided that accepting government funds is too risky. "In general, there's a need for collaborative effort between the public and private sectors," says Joel Samy of American Family Hope, a Michigan nonprofit that helps the working poor. "But it's in the best interests of a church-based ministry to have minimal involvement with government at the funding level." Like Virgil Gulker and others, Samy worries that religion-based providers will exchange their original mission -- with its emphasis on spiritual awakeningfor a governmental agenda. <p><b>Exceptions to the Rule</b><p>	Although the problems afflicting religious nonprofits in their collaboration with the state of Michigan are serious, they do not seem to be inevitable. Some religious agencies have been able to work with government entities, accept tax dollars, and avoid the pitfalls identified above. If Michigan builds on these successful examples of collaboration rather than replicating its faulty models, then Engler's goal of transforming lives by cooperating with nonprofits in social welfare could be advanced.<p>	Detroit Rescue Mission Ministries (DRMM) provides substance-abuse programs and emergency shelter for homeless men and women. It enjoys excellent relations with Wayne County's Sam Chambers and has collaborated for decades with the county department of social services. Chambers has established a community-wide planning board, including several religion-based providers, to discuss policy. Chambers welcomes input from the religious nonprofits. These groups, he explains, are closer to the needs, more "user-friendly,"
 and less bureaucratic and intimidating. Noting that Detroit has 4,000 churches but only 33 welfare offices, Chambers says it is obvious he can meet needs more effectively by tapping into the religious sector. Such groups "do a better job because they tend to treat the whole man," he says.<p>	Aware of the church-state issues involved, Chambers says his evaluations of the religious nonprofits his department works with are "outcome-based." His office enforces health and safety regulations and conducts financial audits, but does not interfere with ministries' internal policies and procedures. There is no attempt to force groups to change their holistic approach or extirpate their religious sensibilities. Chambers says he works with DRMM because the ministry's track record is stellar: It has helped turn around the lives of some of the toughest clients in the welfare system.<p>	This partnership works not only because the approach Chambers takes is one of genuine, respectful, and pragmatic collaboration, but also because DRMM has a clear vision for its ministry and strong leadership. Its president, Don DeVos, says he'll refuse any government grant that compromises the ministry's commitment to holistic ministry. So far, it seems, he has.<p>	In Grand Rapids, Bethany Christian Services works with the Kent County Department of Social Services to provide foster care for at-risk children and residential care for abused and neglected children and juvenile sexual offenders. Its relationship with government is, like DRMM's, cordial and long-standing. John Cole, the program manager for the local DSS, is the ministry's principal government contact. Like Chambers, Cole takes a results-oriented and respectful approach to the partnership. Cole says he "doesn't implement any policy without first developing it in draft form and asking the private groups what they think about it." His staff meets with BCS staff monthly, and he meets personally with BCS leaders quarterly to discuss policy design and implementation. <p>	Unfortunate
ly, according to Cole, this kind of genuine and broad-based collaboration is rare in Michigan. He says that, despite the governor's strong support for privatization, most county welfare offices are biased against purchasing welfare services from private nonprofits. Because of the entrenched state bureaucracy, Cole explains, "There's a preference for county departments to provide their own services." And even when local welfare departments do purchase services from nonprofits, they do not do so as part of a broad, genuine, partnership. "They may purchase services but I don't think they really believe that that's the way they ought to go. I've been in meetings where they [government officials] are very critical of the [private] agencies," Cole says. And at the state level, he says, "the arrangements are very much businesslike and one-sided," even "adversarial" at times.<p><b>Redefining the Relationship</b><p>	Some of the most fruitful state collaborations with religion-based social welfare groups in Michigan appear to rest largely on the goodwill of certain government officials who treat nonprofits as equals and are more interested in enabling religiously based organizations to transform lives than they are in rigorously enforcing a church-state divide. This is a shaky foundation for the partnerships, since such individuals could be replaced by less sympathetic officials. Clearly, a stronger foundation for public-private partnerships is needed. And it must be built soon, before, in our zeal for welfare reform and "devolution," a whole superstructure of arrangements between government and nonprofits is erected. <p>	Some religiously rooted groups will, of course, continue to avoid any involvement with state contracts as they offer help to the needy, and their effectiveness bolsters the case for others to do likewise. But some ministries believe that relying on public funds through state and federal agencies is desirable and potentially beneficial. My investigation into private non-profits in Michigan suggests s
everal steps that both government and faith-based providers could take to guard the integrity of groups that seek out government grants and contracts.<p>	To start, state lawmakers and agency officials need to listen more attentively to the good Samaritans on the front lines. When big government imperiously issues decrees from on high, its private "partners" bust their budgets trying to conform. Genuine collaboration would mean, at best, that ministries would have some say in designing the regulations. Or, at least, that government entities would allow their grassroots partners flexibility in achieving the intentions of the regulations, if not the letter of the law. Otherwise, "working together" means that ministries accomplish less with the "help" they receive from government than they would have in the absence of a state contract.<p>	Politicians must redefine "public-private partnership" to go beyond the "delivery system" model, which is principally concerned with saving money, not transforming lives. In this model, the state decides what services will be offered and then pays private groups to deliver them. Some recent initiatives by Engler suggest he is on the right track. For example, Engler's "Clergy Summit" in October shows an awareness not only of the cost-effectiveness of outreach by the religious community, but also of that community's moral authority in low-income neighborhoods. At the meeting, state officials are expected to solicit the help of pastors in publicizing welfare services. Says an Engler spokesman, "If we can tap into the moral authority and trust that the pastors have, we are much more likely to reach people than if we just hope that some bureaucratic edict from the impersonal state government is suddenly going to make things happen." Absolutely right.<p>	In addition, state officials are now discussing how to broaden their arrangement with the Salvation Army. Social service director Jerry Miller says the state now recognizes the partnership should go beyond the provision of emergency 
services: "We need to work to get [the homeless] into transitional housing" -- and, eventually, permanently off the streets. It remains to be seen whether the Army can conduct this additional work in a way that takes full advantage of its strengths as a religion-based provider of social services.<p>	The Engler administration can go even further. It can hold up the work of officials like Sam Chambers and John Cole as examples of a smart way to develop genuine, effective partnerships with religious organizations. It's not enough for Engler to praise collaboration with these nonprofits. His administration must clearly define the kind of collaboration that is desirable -- and it should look more like the partnership between Wayne County and the Detroit Rescue Mission than the current partnership between Lansing and the Salvation Army.<p>Finally, government officials must acknowledge the value of a religion-based, holistic approach to serving the needy, and take the necessary actions to ensure that ministries agreeing to work with the state do not thereby stumble into the traps discussed. The government welfare system has failed, not only because it is a poor deliverer of the standard package of welfare benefits, but because the package itself is flawed. Cash and commodities are not the things that transform poor people's lives. Religious welfare providers have a better record in changing lives not only because they deliver services more effectively, but because their services are different. They provide "goods" like love, emotional support, spiritual instruction, trust, accountability, moral authority, hope, character training, and basic life skillsall in the context of personal relationships with the poor. They suffer with and walk alongside needy people until those people are able to walk out of the underclass.<p>	Any arrangement with state agencies that fails to give this level of autonomy to religiously grounded outreach efforts may serve the interests of government bureaucrats or certain activists for the 
poor. But it will not, in the long run, help the needy to help themselves.<p><b>AMY L. SHERMAN</B>, <i>a visiting fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, is writing a book on urban ministry</i>.

John, 10, is one of America's children who waits. He waits for
a home, and he has been waiting nearly all of his life. When John
was a toddler, his drug-addicted mom lost her parental rights,
and claimed not to know who the father was. John has been legally
free to be adopted since he was three, but instead has lived in
state-run foster homes and group homes. While his childhood slips
away, John's social workers debate his best interests and the
programs they hope will address them. But this skinny kid who
loves baseball knows better: &quot;I'm all wrapped up in programs,&quot;
he says. &quot;What I need is a mom.&quot;  

<P>Across the country,
there are 50,000 foster children like John, who no longer live
with their mother or father and have been declared by courts as
free to be adopted, but who languish for months or years in state-run,
state-funded substitute care. On any given day, nearly 400,000
other children-none of them eligible for adoption-can be found
in government foster homes, group homes, and shelters. Many of
them are kept there by absentee parents clinging to the legal rights
to their children. 

<P>Foster care and adoption in America have sunk
to a state of near-catastrophe. 

<P>
According to the American Public
Welfare Association, the population of children in substitute
care is growing 33 times faster than the U.S. child population
in general. During each of the past 10 years, more children have
entered the system than exited. Every year, 15,000 children &quot;graduate&quot;
from foster care by turning 18 with no permanent family; 40 percent
of all foster children leaving the system end up on welfare, according
to the American Civil Liberties Union.  

<P>
What was for most of America's
history an entirely private endeavor has become a massive, inefficient
government system. State agencies consistently fail to recruit
enough families for the children eligible for adoption every year;
potential parents often are turned down because of racial considerations,
or turned off by protracted and unnecessary waiting periods; cumbersome
state regulations extend to private adoption agencies and can
even prohibit private attorneys from handling adoptions. The result
is that tens of thousands of children are now free to be adopted
but have nowhere to go. 

<P>
This is the dirty little secret of the
welfare state: Every child is adoptable, and there are waiting
lists of families ready to take in even the most emotionally troubled
and physically handicapped children. Government adoption policies
are utterly failing in their most basic purpose-to quickly place
children who are free to be adopted into permanent homes. 

<P>
The
problem lies not with the children. What keeps kids like John
bound to state care are the tentacles of a bureaucratic leviathan:
a public funding scheme that rewards and extends poor-quality
foster care; an anti-adoption bias that creates numerous legal
and regulatory barriers; and a culture of victimization that places
the whims of irresponsible parents above the well-being of their
children. 

<P>
I can identify with these kids. I was a foster child
in a family that cared for 110 children. That family-my family-adopted
me in the early 1970s. Years later, as a student at Harvard, I
happened upon a book of statistics on children in state care.
I was stunned to learn that decades of research, policymaking,
and government funding had only intensified the system's failures.
I was one of the lucky ones, but luck will not stem the tide of
parentless children. By the year 2000, well over a million children
will enter foster care, and tens of thousands of kids will become
eligible for adoption. Unless the government apparatus of foster
care and adoption is dismantled, these children could spend their
childhoods wishing for what most people take for granted: stability,
a family that will last longer than a few months, a last name.

<P><CENTER><B>Subsidizing</B></CENTER><BR>
Failure For years the rallying cry of many children's activists
has been: &quot;More money!&quot; The National Commission on Family
Foster Care, convened by the Child Welfare League of America,
says that &quot;family foster care and other child welfare services
have never been given the resources necessary&quot; to meet federal
standards, and calls for a &quot;fully funded array of child and
family welfare services.&quot; When it comes to child welfare,
rare is the research article that does not call for more money
and further research. 

<P>
America already is spending $10 billion
a year on foster care and adoption services through public agencies.
Federal dollars now account for nearly a third of all foster care
funding, with most of the rest coming from state coffers. California
alone spends at least $635 million a year on substitute care;
the District of Columbia spent $53 million last year on a system
that was so poorly run it recently was taken over by a federal
court. 

<P>
According to the ACLU, a year in foster care costs about
$17,500 per child, including per-child payments to foster families
and administrative costs of child welfare agencies. That does
not include counseling and treatment programs for biological parents
or foster parent recruitment and training. The <I>San Francisco
Chronicle</I> reports that per-child costs for foster home or
group home care have increased more than fourfold in the past
decade. 

<P>
The problem with foster care is not the level of government
spending, it is the structure of that spending. The funding system
gives child-welfare bureaucracies incentives to keep even free-to-be-adopted
kids in state care. State-social-service agencies are neither
rewarded for helping children find adoptive homes nor penalized
for failing to do so in a reasonable amount of time. There is
no financial incentive to recruit adoptive families. And as more
children enter the system, so does the tax money to support them
in substitute care.  

<P>
By contrast, private adoption agencies are
paid to find suitable families quickly, even if it means going
out of state. The public social-service bureaucracy, nearly overwhelmed
by other urban problems, has little to gain by devoting extra
resources to adoption. Private adoption agencies are free to focus
on finding homes for kids and are financially motivated to do
so. Private adoption agencies are paid according to the number
of successful placements; public agencies, in a sense, are paid
for the number of children they prevent from being adopted. 

<P>
There
is a similar reward for foster parents to keep kids in state care.
By law, adoption subsidies cannot exceed foster care payments,
and in practice they are almost always lower. According to the
National Foster Parent Association, foster families in 1993 received
anywhere from $200 to $530 a month for each child under age 10,
plus additional money from states and counties. The subsidies
are tax free, and foster parents receive more money as the children
under their care get older. So the longer the system fails to
find permanent homes for kids, the more money flows to those fostering.


<P>
In some states, payments to foster parents caring for four kids
equal the after-tax income of a $35,000-a-year job. The money
is tax free. It doesn't take much imagination to see that paying
people to parent can lead to mischief. Parents are not held accountable
for how they spend their federal and state allocations; for too
many foster parents, the children in their homes are reduced to
mere income streams. If foster parents don't wish to adopt the
children under their care, what incentive do they have to alert
other parents hoping to adopt?  

<P>
Let me be very clear: There are
many dedicated and compassionate people in the foster care system,
serving as case workers, counselors, and foster parents. My own
experience in foster care was a positive one. But I have seen
and heard of too many that were heartbreaking failures.

<P><CENTER><B>Special-Needs
Stigma</B></CENTER><BR>
I have heard perhaps a thousand times that the children
who wait cannot be adopted because they have &quot;special needs.&quot;
Of course they do-they need parents. They require love and nurturing
that endures. But the &quot;special needs&quot; referred to by
advocates come with federal dollars attached. In 1980, Congress
started offering states matching funds to assist the adoption
of children with special needs, which included children of various
ages, ethnic backgrounds, and those with severe mental and physical
handicaps who may require expensive care. The subsidy was to become
available only after a state determined that it could not reasonably
expect to place a child without it. 

<P>
As with so many other federal
subsidies, states quickly expanded their slice of the government
pie by broadening the criteria for receiving money. Today, nearly
two- thirds of all foster children qualify. In some states, special-needs
children include kids who have a sibling; are black, biracial,
Hispanic, or Native American; are &quot;older,&quot; as defined
by the state; or have been in foster care longer than 18 months.


<P>
Two leading adoption organizations report that there are no national
figures available that break down the type of need, or indicate
the number of children who have physical or emotional handicaps
that would require extra expenses by their new parents. This leaves
the door wide open to all sorts of graft and fiscal abuse.  

<P>But
there are other unintended and unconscionable consequences of
this masquerade. One is that the needs of very vulnerable children
are downplayed. The plight of a teen-age girl in a wheelchair
who requires constant attention is trivialized when she is included
in the same group as children whose &quot;needs&quot; are that
they are eight years old. Another result-one I see often-is that
local social-services departments discourage families from adopting
by telling them, &quot;Oh, these kids aren't for you. We only
have <I>special-needs</I> children.&quot; This emphasis on kids
with the most challenging emotional and physical handicaps unwittingly
contributes to the false notion that foster children are &quot;unadoptable.&quot;
Ironically, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980
that established special-needs matching funds warned that children
must not be &quot;routinely classified as 'hard-to-place.'&quot;
Government funding has had just that effect, and it is helping
to delay the placement of children ready for adoption.  

<P>
I am convinced
that the entire incentive structure for foster care and public
agency adoption helps perpetuate the system's failure. It is a
failure rooted in the notion that government funding is the panacea
for family disintegration. The National Commission on Family Foster
Care claims the foster care crisis is &quot;the logical result
of two decades of national neglect in providing funding and services
for children, youths, and their families.&quot; On the contrary,
as long as these children come with tax money attached-with little
in the way of accountability-those invested in perpetuating the
system will do little to reform it. As one foster child put it:
&quot;Everywhere I go, somebody gets money to keep me from having
a mom and dad.&quot;

<P>
<CENTER><B>Anti-Adoption Bias</B></CENTER><BR>  
Government funding schemes
and inefficiencies that prevent adoption exist within a larger
framework: a steadily growing bias against adoption. Despite all
the sociological evidence of the benefits of adoption, the conviction
that a child does best in a permanent, loving, and stable home
is all but missing from the ethos of state-run substitute care.
How can this be? 

<P>
In both the popular and elite media, a deep suspicion
of adoption is all too evident. Marvin Olasky, a professor at
the University of Texas at Austin, has noted that a New York Times
series on adoption included such headlines as &quot;The Ties that
Traumatize&quot; and &quot;Adoption is Getting Some Harder Looks.&quot;
And what do <I>Playboy</I>, <I>Mirabella</I>, and <I>Good Housekeeping
</I>have in common? As Olasky says, each has joined the offensive
with an article that warns readers against the &quot;distasteful
&#133; bartering of lives&quot; that supposedly is adoption. 

<P>
Television
writers would have us believe that adoption has no happy endings.
TV portrays adoption as shady, risky, and shameful. Over the last
year, a dozen programs featured adoption in their plots, and in
every case the adoption agency was depicted as callously profit-driven.
The adopting families were white, middle-class couples who kept
secrets from the authorities or from each other. Birth mothers
were unfairly portrayed as selfish or disturbed. The programs
paid little attention to the well-being of the children. 

<P>
Groups
such as Concerned United Birthparents (CUB) help give legal expression
to this bias. CUB was behind the &quot;Baby Jessica&quot; case
that led to the removal of a two-year-old from her adoptive family.
Groups like CUB claim that adoption is a feminist issue, that
only the outmoded ideal of a two-parent family makes the notion
of adoption palatable. As Olasky notes, Joss Sawyer's book <I>Death
by Adoption</I> calls adoption &quot;a violent act, a political
act of aggression toward a woman.&quot; 

<P>
Perhaps more significant,
however, is the battle against transracial adoption that has been
waged by the National Association of Black Social Workers (NABSW)
for more than two decades. Its 1972 position paper reads: &quot;Black
children belong physically, psychologically, and culturally in
Black families in order that they receive the total sense of themselves.&quot;
Otherwise, the group claims, black children &quot;will not have
the background and knowledge which is necessary to survive in
a racist society.&quot; Our institute has received letters from
adoptive families in many states who have been barred from adopting
transracially. According to the North American Council on Adoptable
Children, state adoption laws may allow for race-matching, but
 &quot;their preferencing policy isn't written down.&quot; 
 
<P>When
it comes to transracial adoptions, there is no longer much doubt
that current policies are bringing the greatest harm to the very
community they were intended to help: African Americans. Just
consider the numbers: Though black families adopt at very high
rates, black children represent nearly half of foster kids waiting
to be adopted. Fifteen percent of all children in America are
black; but 40 percent of the children in foster care are black.
State delays in finding homes for black children, as case workers
search for &quot;culturally consistent&quot; placements, can keep
kids languishing in state care for years. 

<P>
&quot;These policies
are seriously harmful to black children, requiring that black
kids who could get good homes be left in foster care,&quot; Harvard
law professor Elizabeth Bartholet told the <I>New York Times</I>.
&quot;There is not an iota of evidence in all the empirical studies
that transracial adoption does any harm at all.&#133;There is
plenty of evidence that delay in adoption does do harm.&quot;


<P>
Such policies reveal a profound misunderstanding of the nature
and effects of adoption. To insist that successful adoption means
placing a child in a family of his  racial or ethnic heritage
is to overlook what every adopted child understands intuitively:
Adoption is not easy. No matter how much a child's family looks
like him, it does not alter the fact that someone gave him up.
Having the same skin color as the people in his household doesn't
automatically erase that. Only love does. As someone who grew
up in a multi-ethnic family, I find it incomprehensible when people
tell me that I cannot love my siblings the way I could if our
skin color matched.

<P>
<CENTER><B>The Fallout</B></CENTER><BR>  
Attitudes against adoption, whether
racially motivated or not, share at least two flaws. First, they
ignore all the best evidence indicating that adoption leads to
positive outcomes for kids. Last year, the Search Institute of
Minneapolis released the largest study ever of adopted adolescents
and their families (see table above). The study, in which 881
adopted children and 1,262 adoptive parents were surveyed, found
that children who were adopted fared as well as or better than
a national sample of non-adopted adolescents in self-esteem, mental
health, school achievement-even the amount of time spent each
week helping others. Adopted adolescents were more likely to agree
or strongly agree with the statement &quot;There is a lot of love
in my family&quot; than were non-adopted children. 

<P>
Sociological
studies of transracial adoptions are equally encouraging. Rita
Simon of American University has conducted a 20-year longitudinal
study of transracial adoption. She found that such adoptions cause
none of the problems alleged by the NABSW. Rather, black children
adopted into white families typically &quot;grow up with a positive
sense of their black identity and a knowledge of their history
and culture.&quot; And such children, Simon says, often possess
&quot;special interpersonal talents and skills at bridging cultures.&quot;


<P>
Second, the anti-adoption movement fortifies the legal and bureaucratic
obstacles that are keeping children from finding permanent homes.
There are numerous state laws that needlessly complicate or block
the process. In Minnesota, for example, if filing deadlines and
other technical requirements of state adoption law are not precisely
met, parents can be prevented for months or years from finalizing
a child's adoption. Thanks to horror stories of baby-selling,
four states have laws that ban independent adoptions (though exceptions
are permitted). Despite this, more than 45,000 adoptions in 1992
were conducted through private agencies or independent agents-the
vast majority of them successfully. 

<P>
My office receives numerous
letters from people eager to adopt but frustrated by laws and
bureaucrats. One woman recently wrote: &quot;My husband and I
decided we would like to adopt a little girl, thinking we had
a lot of love, nurturing, and stability to give a child who had
been abandoned or abused. Almost immediately I hit a brick wall.&quot;
Her local department of social services-in a state with more than
5,000 foster children free to be adopted-told her it was &quot;not
taking new cases&quot; of families willing to adopt foster children.
A couple wrote that of their three adopted children, &quot;two
[had] lingered in foster care, one of whom we were not able to
adopt until he was age 18.&quot; 

<P>
<CENTER><B>Adoptable You</B></CENTER><BR>  
There is at least
one other mistaken notion that feeds the legal and cultural bias
against adoption-the idea that many of the children in foster
care are simply not adoptable. My own experience suggests otherwise,
as I was an older child when my foster parents adopted me. And
my experience with parents in and outside the foster care system
tells me that every child is adoptable. 

<P>
For every child who is
ready for a permanent home, there are families waiting. It is
time to shatter the myth that adoptive parents are interested
only in &quot;healthy white babies.&quot; There are waiting lists
to adopt white children, black children, Hispanic children, infants
and teens, children with Down's syndrome and with AIDS. Private
agencies for years have found families for all types of children.
Adopt a Special Kid, a California-based service, receives more
than 1,500 inquiries annually from families interested in adopting
children with disabilities. The National Adoption Center maintains
a computerized listing of 650 qualified families waiting to embrace
disabled &quot;older&quot; children. The center reports that infants,
even the most severely disabled, are adopted almost immediately.


<P>
Outside of the thousands of families who have successfully completed
home studies and have registered with with their states, there
are no hard figures for the number of parents able and willing
to adopt. Certainly there are families who would come forward
if public agencies recruited more aggressively. Beginning in November,
1993, Massachusetts stepped up its recruitment efforts with public-service
announcements, an aggressive media campaign, adoption &quot;open
houses,&quot; and community-based recruitment. Such efforts helped
increase foster child adoptions by 47 percent in one year. 

<P>
Most
people know someone who has gone to heroic lengths to adopt. Americans
adopted more than 7,300 children from other countries in 1993,
according to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.
The INS estimates that the 1994 figure exceeds 8,000. Others have
spent their life savings to offer permanence to a child; domestic
adoption through private agencies or independent attorneys can
cost more than $30,000. It is not unusual for foster parents to
adopt two, five, or even 10 children under their care. Clearly,
the barriers to adoption are neither the characteristics of children
who wait nor the parents who want to care for them.

<P>
<CENTER><B>The Route toFoster Care</B></CENTER><BR>
In addition to the 50,000 children who today are
legally free to be adopted, there are hundreds of thousands more
who drift for days, months, or years within the state-run system-a
system that too often guarantees a parentless future for some
of society's most vulnerable members. 

<P>
Children enter foster care
for a variety of reasons. Mom abuses or neglects one of her kids,
dad is using drugs or is arrested for a felony, or perhaps the
parents are just having a hard time coping with the responsibilities
of parenthood. The American Public Welfare Association reports
that 70 percent of foster children enter the system because of
abuse, neglect, or &quot;parental conditions&quot;-including drug
addiction, incarceration, illness, or death. More than 600,000
kids will spend all or part of 1995 in substitute care, up from
434,000 in 1982. 

<P>
A profile of children in state care belies the
stigma that foster children are mostly &quot;unadoptable&quot;
troubled teens. Researchers at the Chapin Hall Center for Children
at the University of Chicago studied five states whose foster
care children make up about half of the U.S. foster care population.
They found that from 1990 to 1992, nearly 25 percent of all first
admissions to foster care were babies less than one year old.
Between 1983 and 1992, the proportion of 12- to 15-year-olds entering
substitute care in those states declined. The American Public
Welfare Association cites similar trends.   

<P>
Sadly, the youngest
children remain in the system the longest. The University of Chicago
study revealed that, after controlling for other factors, children
who enter foster care as infants remain in the system 22 percent
longer than other young children.  

<P>
The fact remains, however,
that foster care is failing children of all ages. The ACLU reports
that one in 10 foster children remains in state care longer than
7.4 years. At least 40,600 foster children have been in care for
five years or longer; another 51,300 have been in care between
three and five years. System kids, on average, live with three
different families, though 10 or more placements is not uncommon.
&quot;Every new placement is a loss,&quot; says Michael B. Pines,
a psychologist specializing in attachment disorders. &quot;The
result is that these kids begin not to trust anyone.&quot; 

<P>
<CENTER><B>Paidto Parent</B></CENTER><BR>
One of the reasons that foster care tends to ensnare
children in a legal and emotional limbo is that its bureaucracy
and incentive system attract parents who are unable or unwilling
to adopt or help find homes for the children in their care. 

<P>
Whether
adopting through private or public adoption agencies, would-be
parents must undergo a home study.  Private agencies, which must
successfully place children in homes to stay in business, are
free to set higher standards for parents than public agencies
do. Christian or other faith-based adoption agencies typically
emphasize tough standards of behavior. But this is not so for
state-run substitute care. In many states, adults who fail the
adoption home study get a consolation prize: They can become foster
parents. Deemed unworthy to serve as legal adoptive parents, these
adults are then paid handsomely to raise children in state care.

<P>
Foster homes, group homes, and public orphanages share another
vice: Their government money comes with regulations attached.
This often guarantees confusion and conflict. Private orphanages
always have been driven by a mission:  keep girls from getting
pregnant, keep children in school, expose children to the Christian
faith, and so on. They use a combination of rules and rewards,
discipline and love to fulfill their mission. Often, this isn't
allowed in a state-run group home, where it may be against the
law to hug a child, or to lock the door after midnight, or even
to advertise for a married couple to serve as housemasters.  

<P>
If
a permanent, loving family is the surest route to producing happy,
well-adjusted children, then what effect does the foster care
system, at its worst, have on countless kids? The result of the
system's delays, incentive structure, and regulatory grip is that
many former foster children ultimately remain dependent on state
services. They are wildly over-represented among welfare recipients,
the homeless, and in juvenile and adult prison populations. In
Los Angeles County, 39 percent of homeless youth are former foster
children. In New York, 23 percent of the homeless were once in
foster care; in Minneapolis, the figure is 38 percent. According
to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, former foster children make
up nearly 14 percent of America's prison population.

<P>
<CENTER><B>Culture ofVictimization</B></CENTER><BR>  

The financial disincentives to adoption and the
legal and societal biases against it do not exist in a vacuum;
they are rooted in the soil of victimization. More than half of
the children who enter foster care were abused or neglected in
their families of origin. But the current system grants &quot;victim
status&quot; to these parents. It often allows them to cling to
their parental rights as they move in and out of social service
programs. As a result, tens of thousands of children remain trapped
in foster care, never free to be adopted into stable, loving homes.


<P>
Take the case of Halie (not her real name), a two-year-old girl
who one day wouldn't eat her dinner. Her mother and mother's boyfriend
tied her to an electric heater. Hours passed, until Halie's face,
chest, and arm were disfigured. Her mother then threw her into
a cold shower, dressed her, and took her to a hospital-claiming
the child had spilled hot water on herself. After weeks of hospitalization,
Halie entered foster care. For the next 10 years, her biological
mother-coached by the local department of social services-maintained
her legal rights to the child. Case workers helped Halie's mom
to toe the official line to prove she somehow was still capable
as a parent: She married her boyfriend and had a child with him.


<P>
When Halie was 12, her case workers and a judge approved overnight
and extended visits between Halie and her biological mother. Halie's
mother rejected a judge's offer to regain custody. She didn't
want to raise Halie, but didn't want to let her go, and the state
gave her all the legal and financial help she needed. Halie spent
her teen years in group homes and foster homes. She turned 18
in foster care. 

<P>
Most states give biological parents every possible
chance to prove they are fit-while their babies grow up in state
care. A family recently wrote me about their two-year-old foster
daughter: &quot;She is precious beyond belief, and her parents
are being given chance upon chance to clean up their lives-at
her expense, as we see it. She is so adoptable by the right family,
but the system will keep her under lock and key for years if necessary
for her parents' benefit.&quot; 

<P>
In our social-work schools, counseling
centers, and government-funded research, the culture of victimization
insists that the most despicable behavior by abusive parents has
its causes in economics, racism, broken homes-anything but the
consciences and moral choices of men and women. We have devised
a foster care system that puts a vogue pop psychology ahead of
the well-being of children. This helps explain why roughly a third
of all the foster children who are reunited with their families
of origin soon return to state care. Indeed, it is the only explanation
for some of the bizarre attempts I have seen to reunite a foster
child with a parent who is clearly unwilling or unfit. 

<P>
Under federal
law, states cannot obtain federal funds for foster care unless
&quot;reasonable efforts&quot; are made to keep members of the
family of origin together (&quot;family preservation&quot;) or
to reunite the family ( &quot;family reunification&quot;). But
the federal government nowhere defines &quot;reasonable efforts,&quot;
and only a few states have specific statutes. It's a classic Catch-22:
Children are not free to be adopted until every reasonable effort
is made to return them to their biological parents. But almost
no one seems to know what constitutes a reasonable effort, that
is, what services must be offered to parents who need outside
help. 

<P>
When, for example, a public agency reports to a judge that
a mother has failed her drug-treatment program, the judge is likely
to insist that the mom enter every drug treatment program available.
So biological parents are given multiple chances to fail at parenting,
while children may bounce between state care and their family
of origin. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) admits
that the inability to meet &quot;reasonable efforts&quot; standards
is the primary barrier to foster child adoption. 

<P>
From my own experience
in foster care, the most difficult part was watching my brothers
and sisters return to biological parents who had burned or beaten
them, or put out cigarettes on their children's bottoms. I felt
like an accomplice. It must have been hard for my parents, who
could do nothing to stop it. 

<P>
Most foster parents, at one point
or another, must relinquish a child to a home situation that is
precarious. One foster mother of five years wrote: &quot;I have
been seriously reconsidering my position as a foster parent because
when we started this it was to try to help these children, and
I am finding out that I am not able to do that. The pain and heartbreak
of not being able to protect these children is a heavy burden
to bear.&quot; Until the system is reshaped, it is a burden that
every one of us carries.

<P>
<CENTER><B>Assignment: Adoption</B></CENTER><BR> 
It is one thing to
tolerate inefficiencies and bureaucratic delays in other areas
of public life-public toll roads, for example. Such inefficiencies
don't cost children 18 years of their lives. We do not need another
study, or blue-ribbon commission, or congressional subcommittee
hearing. When I was four years old, it didn't matter to me that
someone was getting a research grant to study the effects of foster
care on childhood development. What I wanted was a last name.


<P>
I am convinced that there are more parents willing to adopt than
there are children ready to be adopted. But the market for adoption
is frustrated by the regulatory system now in place. To create
a more efficient system, one with incentives to help rather than
abandon innocent children, we must get Big Government out of the
business of parenting. I do not mean we should create a market
in babies. I am not talking about baby-selling. I am talking about
serving babies and children by removing the barriers to their
enjoyment of stable, loving homes.  

<P>
Where parts of foster care
and adoption are privately run, competition and incentives have
led to better outcomes for children. In Michigan, where two-thirds
of foster care management is privatized, private providers spend
less per child, yet have achieved better social worker-to-child
ratios than those of state-run agencies. Adoption is, in fact,
the ultimate form of privatization: wresting authority over children's
lives from the state and allowing children to be free, to be raised
not by government but by parents.  

<P>
We must reform, state by state,
our system of transferring parental rights-from the government,
which can never be a parent, to parents who are eager and able
to bring these children into their hearts and lives. Congress
recently has taken interest in adoption reform by proposing a
$5,000 tax credit for adoptive parents. But will that tax credit
get children out of foster care more quickly? No. Does it stimulate
a market in private adoptions? No. Does it allow independent adoptions
in states where they are now outlawed? No. 

<P>
Tax credits might make
adoption a little easier for some parents, but they will not make
adoption work. To do that, we need reform at the federal and state
levels-bureaucratic reform that will shatter the incentive structure
that traps kids in foster care, and legal reform that will free
children who already have spent years in substitute care. In Massachusetts,
we call it &quot;Assignment: Adoption,&quot; a comprehensive plan
that our institute is bringing before federal lawmakers and state
governors: 

<P>
<B>Hold states accountable for reporting their progress
in finding homes for children in foster care.</B> Here is one federal
mandate that states ought to be obliged to take on. Washington
should require that states make publicly available, within 30
days of the close of each fiscal year, the following information:
(1) the number of foster children in state care; (2) the number
of foster children free to be adopted and still in state care,
but not in pre-adoptive placements; (3) the number of state-recruited
families with completed home studies. 

<P>
Most conservatives right
now wouldn't touch a federal mandate with a 10-foot pole. I would
prefer to see an entirely private system that includes a strong
charitable element. Until that happens, a few basic requirements
on the states are in order. We're talking about giving children
a mother and a father. And until we know the depth of the problem
in each state, until the number of kids waiting for homes becomes
part of our thinking and vocabulary, state agencies are unlikely
to change. There are people in our state departments of social
services who know these numbers, but we're not hearing them. 

<P>
<B>Prohibit
race-based delays in adoption.</B> Congressional attempts to outlaw
race-matching in adoption have yet to free tens of thousands of
children of color from foster care. This summer, the U.S. Senate
will consider a welfare-reform bill that prohibits race-based
delays in adoption. Even if Congress approves the bill, its impact
could be minimal. 

<P>
Recall that the Multiethnic Placement Act of
1994, sponsored by former U.S. Senator Howard Metzenbaum, had
a similar goal, but it was watered down. Under guidelines released
by HHS in April, the new law allows adoption agencies to consider
the child's &quot;cultural, ethnic, and racial background.&quot;
As reported by the Washington Post, the guidelines &quot;stopped
far short of requiring that adoption must be colorblind.&quot;


<P>
It is at this point that the discrepancies between legal precedent,
public policy, and social-work practices become painfully clear.
The HHS guidelines have not overturned any state laws requiring
that race be considered in adoption. And with vaguely written
state statutes, case workers will continue to have a lot of power
over whether a child will be adopted or languish in long-term
&quot;temporary&quot; care. 

<P>
Suppose every state had adoption policies
that were truly colorblind. We at the Institute for Children are
challenging governors to remove any and all restrictions to adoption
based on race. What would happen if thousands of children of color
grew up in white or mixed-race families? It would produce an amazing
generation of young people who, instead of growing up without
a last name or a permanent home, were raised by loving parents
in a diverse, multicultural environment. Why are some black leaders
so afraid of that? If their real agenda is the well-being of children,
then the evidence is in. Children are infinitely better off in
a loving, interracial home than as virtual orphans in foster care.


<P>
<B>End government funding that creates incentives to keep children
in substitute care for longer than 12 months.</B> Part of the problem
is that government money extends indefinitely, with no sanctions
enforced against  bureaucratic delays. The Adoption Assistance
and Child Welfare Act of 1980 required a &quot;permanency plan&quot;
for every child within 18 months of entering foster care. This
means that case workers decide whether to reunite a child with
his family, place him in long-term fostering, an independent living
arrangement, a group home, or make him  free for adoption. Adoption
is the permanency plan for 100,000 foster children, but no one
knows how often these plans result in permanent homes for children.


<P>
Deadlines for permanency plans come and go, court dates are postponed,
files are lost as children are shuffled among foster families.
A federal study reveals that children spend, on average, 30 to
42 months in foster care before adoption is even decided on as
a permanency plan. Once that happens, the state files a petition
to terminate parental rights; the filing can take another six
months or more. A report by HHS admits that in some states &quot;children
had an official plan of adoption for more than three years, but
no petitions had been filed.&quot;  

<P>The result is that in probably
every state there are children who have been in foster care longer
than 10 years. Meanwhile, the money to support children in state-run
care keeps coming, with no consequences to the state bureaucracies
that fail to place children.  

<P>
<B>Require that states find adoptive
homes for children within 30 days after the termination of parental
rights.</B> The foster child who is freed for adoption typically has
been in the system for at least two years and has had a permanency
plan of adoption for at least one year. Yet, as children become
legally free to be adopted, states claim to need more time to
find families for them! Our institute recommends a 30-day window:
If the state does not have a qualified family waiting, one who
has met the child and is ready to proceed with the adoption, then
state officials must contract out the adoption process to a private
agency. Qualified families exist in large numbers, and private
adoption agencies are pretty good at finding them. Three years
ago, Michigan launched a carrot-and-stick program with public
and private adoption agencies to get kids into permanent homes
more quickly. Since then, total adoptions are up, and the number
of black children adopted has increased by 121 percent-about 700
kids in the past year alone. 

<P>
Critics call this baby-selling and
claim that government should not act like a business. As someone
who has seen the machinery of the state from the inside, I argue
that government could promote children's well-being much more
effectively if it acted more like a business. I am not alone in
noting the failure of foster care management. The director of
the ACLU's Children's Rights Project recently wrote, &quot;If
the foster care system were considered a business, with its profit-and-loss
statements judged in terms of unnecessary human suffering inflicted
by mismanaged systems, in terms of misspent dollars, or even in
terms of how far these systems depart from their own goals, it
would have been forced into bankruptcy long ago.&quot;

<P>
<CENTER><B>Getting
Kids Out of Limbo</B></CENTER><BR> 

All of the above reforms are aimed at getting
the children now eligible for adoption into permanent homes as
quickly as possible. But there are more than 600,000 children
in foster care at some point during the year. Most of those kids
are happily reunited with their parents. Many of them, however,
become trapped in the state-run system-children who are never
free to be adopted, but who will not or should not return to their
biological parents. There are at least three steps every governor
could take to rescue these children from the worst effects of
foster care and help them find a home: 

<P>
<B>Make entrance requirements
for foster families as stringent as those for adoptive families.</B>
In the wake of a wave of child deaths in foster care, people are
beginning to speak out about the need to raise the standards for
being licensed as a foster parent. As one advocate put it, to
be a foster parent &quot;all you need is a clean criminal record
and an extra bed.&quot; People who have failed an adoption home
study can sign up with the state as foster parents. Foster children
deserve better than that. 

<P>
Critics argue that if we raise the requirements
for foster families, there won't be enough qualified people to
take care of the kids. I have more confidence in the generosity
of the American people. I think if you raise the requirements,
you'll see more foster parents and better care. Look, for example,
at private schools with higher requirements and lower teacher
salaries than public schools; they  continue to attract excellent
teachers and deliver a quality education. By maintaining a separate
set of standards for foster parents than those for adoptive parents,
we are saying to a half-million kids that it is not important
where they spend the most formative years of their lives. 

<P>
But
this is not the only disgrace in foster-parent licensing and training
procedures. In state-sponsored training courses, foster parents
are admonished, &quot;Do not get too close to your foster children.
Do not form a bond.&quot; Foster parents are instructed that their
main task is to facilitate a child's return to his or her biological
parents. From day one, good foster parents are discouraged from
adopting. 

<P>
Certainly there is a stigma attached to being a foster
parent-the system has created it. It is that stigma that discourages
many capable and loving people from fostering. If the entrance
requirements for fostering were as high as those for adopting,
foster children would be better cared for. The anti-adoption establishment
wouldn't like it, because it would ruin the standard argument
that foster parents are not adequate to adopt. 

<P>
<B>Allow no more than
12 months for biological parents to prove their fitness to resume
custody of their children.</B> This may be the most difficult law
to pass at the state level, but it also may be the most desperately
needed. State laws can be so vaguely written and so easily assailable
that termination of parental rights is always a last resort and
can take years of court hearings. There are many in the field
who believe it is almost always better to send children back to
their natural parents. The Child Welfare League promotes the notion
that &quot;no one can truly substitute for the family of origin.&quot;


<P>
I agree that nature provides every child with two protectors-a
man and a woman-and that we're meant to be with our biological
parents. But nature didn't design women's bodies to endure crack
cocaine; it didn't design children to be shaken until they suffer
cerebral hemorrhages. Family preservation doesn't work in these
cases because there is nothing left to preserve. 

<P>
State governors
should take the lead in setting tough sanctions against parents
who neglect or abuse their kids. By setting a deadline for parents
to get their lives together-to get off drugs, get out of jail,
find a place to live, and even get a job or go to school-we remind
them that they really are responsible for their actions. But the
deadline must be final and incontestable; otherwise, irresponsible
parents will continue to imprison their children in a labyrinth
of legal battles and parentless foster care. The 12-month limit
has yet to be adopted by any state and is indeed a radical departure
from the years it can now take to legally separate a child from
unfit parents. 

<P>
<B>Allow no more than 30 days from the birth of the
child for biological fathers to formalize paternity.</B> The &quot;Baby
Jessica&quot; and &quot;Baby Richard&quot; cases have demonstrated
the law's allowance for biological fathers who come out of the
woodwork to claim their children after they've been adopted. In
the now pending &quot;Baby Emily&quot; case, a little girl born
in 1992 was soon placed for adoption after the father's rights
were terminated for abandonment (he was doing jail time for a
rape conviction). But now the father is out of prison and has
sued for custody of his daughter. The adoptive family's finances
have been completely exhausted as the case awaits adjudication
in Florida's supreme court. 

<P>
Governor William Weld of Massachusetts
has sent to the legislature a proposal that, if passed, will prevent
such tragic cases in Massachusetts. The proposal requires every
unwed biological father to formalize paternity within 30 days
of the child's birth, and to maintain contact with the child and
provide financial support to the best of his ability-or forfeit
his right to contest the child's adoption. Ideally, that would
mean no appeals, no hearings, no state officials pulling children
out of their adoptive homes. The legislation, if not severely
amended, could serve as a model for state reform.

<P><CENTER><B>A Life That Matters</B></CENTER><BR>
A teenage girl-we'll call her Sarah-who worked for our institute
last summer was a system kid; she had turned 18 in foster care.
This was her first job and she was surprised when she noticed
that taxes had been taken out of her paycheck. She asked me what
the government would do with her money. In my usual non-partisan
spirit, I explained how the federal government would spend the
$300 withheld from her summer earnings. She actually started to
cry. She looked at me and asked, &quot;Will it go to pay for foster
care?&quot; She said it hurt her that she had worked so hard only
to help the government keep some other child from being adopted.
 

<P>
That's what the system is doing to our children. Though my own
experience in foster care was a good one, it opened my eyes to
the real hardships of countless children. My foster brothers and
sisters who might have gone back safely to their families of origin
too often and for too long were delayed from doing so. Others
lived the saddest stories of rejection-they had been burned, beaten,
sodomized or battered, left in a doorway or in a fruit field,
but later sent &quot;home&quot; to their abusers. Like foster
children everywhere, many who could have been adopted were denied
the chance to be loved and cherished by a family who would always
be there. 

<P>
Let's be honest: Adoption is no fairy tale. It is a
risk. Kids don't always go home and live happily ever after. But
every parentless child knows the alternative: the feeling that
there is no one to whom her &quot;case&quot;-that is, her life-really
matters.  

<P>
When parents adopt, they can accomplish something government
cannot: They can convince a child she matters. That's what makes
adoption such a great gift, an expression of unconditional love
and compassion. Don't we, as a society, owe that gift to our children?

At least 90,000 children have been in foster longer than three
years. One in ten foster children remains in care longer than 7
years.
<P>
The population of children in substitute care is growing 33 times
faster than the overall U.S. child population. Every year, 15,000
foster children turn 18 with no permanent family.
<P>
A year in foster care costs taxpayers $17,500 per child. Last year,
California spent $635 million on foster and group home care.
<P>
More than half of all foster children were abused or neglected
by their biological parents.
<P>
Fifteen percent of all children in America are black,but 40 percent
of the children in foster care are black.
<P>
More than 600,000 kids will spend all or part of 1995 in substitute
care - up from 434,000 in 1982.
<P>
After Massachusetts launched an aggressive pro-adoption campaign, foster
child adoptions increased by 47 percent.

<p>
Suppose you are 20 years old and earning $10,000 a year. You and your employer are paying $1,240 a year in Social Security taxes. That's 12.4 percent of your hard-earned income, for benefits that you will never see.<p>
Suppose instead you could invest that same $1,240, as well as an additional $2.50 a week. By the time you are 65, thanks to the magic of compound interest, you would be a millionaire. You would be assured a comfortable retirement.<p>
This isn't a game-show fantasy. This isn't a lottery jackpot. It is a realistic goal. But unlocking this economic opportunity means revolutionizing Social Security. Every American who earns $10,000 a year or more can become a millionaire over the course of one working lifetime45 years. By the year 2000, there will be over 100 million Americans who fall in this category.<p>
In a recent survey, Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 reported they are more likely to see a UFO (46 percent) than their Social Security benefits (28 percent). They're right. The Social Security trust fund starts running out of money, under current projections, in the year 2013. If you're 20 today, that's when you turn 38. By the year 2030, when you turn 55, the fund will be short $200 billion a year and be unable to meet one quarter of its obligations. By the year 2042, when you turn 67 and reach your so-called normal retirement age, the fund will have an accumulated debt of $4.7 trillion. I'm not making this up. This isn't science fiction. These numbers come from the 1994 report of the trustees of the Social Security system.<p>
You could get all your benefits, of course, if there were an enormous tax increase for your children and grandchildren. According to the Social Security trustees, honoring existing promises for Social Security and Medicare benefits will require a rise in payroll taxes from the current level of 15.3 percent to 25.7 percent in 2030. But that simply isn't going to happen. Americans are already overtaxed. Do you think they'll put up with 25 percent payroll taxes, and federal income taxes, plus state and local taxes on top of that?<p>
Some politicians will tell you not to worry: Social Security is building up a big trust fund that will take care of all those promises. By the end of this year, the trust fund will have $475 billion in assetson paper. By 2020, there will be $3 trillion on paper. The trouble is, when the program needs the money, the money will already have been spent on everything the federal government spends money on. To redeem its IOUs to the trust fund, the federal government will have to borrow money or raise taxesby over $36,000 per familyjust as if the trust fund had no assets at all.<p>
So you and your employer are now paying one eighth of your income to pay for the Social Security benefits of current retirees, and to build up an illusory trust fund. Meanwhile, your own retirement is in jeopardy.<p>
No wonder younger Americans fear they are on a treadmill. No wonder there is so much trepidation about the future of the country. No wonder we have a savings crisis: our savings are being spent. No wonder most Americans now say their children will enjoy less opportunity than they do. <p>
It doesn't have to be this way. Social Security can be saved without raising taxes, and without lowering the benefits or cost-of-living adjustments of existing retirees. Social Security can be saved in a way that will open up opportunity for younger peopleso that their standard of living will be better than that of their parents and grandparents. If we use the principles of democratic capitalism to reform Social Security, the 20-year-old making the minimum wage can become a millionaire by the time he or she retires.<p>
Most Americans are on a treadmill because they have but one source of income: wages. The way to get ahead is to earn income from capital. Money makes money. With capital, you can retire in comfort and bequeath a nest egg to your children.<p>
Here is the beauty of capitalism. Any American currently earning $12,580 or more pays $30 a week, or $1,560 a year, into Social Security. Imagine that, beginning at age 20, you invest that $30 a week at market rates. When you retire, you'll be a millionaire. Whoever earns at least the minimum wage can become a millionaire in 45 years.<p>
The secret is compound interest. Let's assume a long-term return on your investments of 8 percent a year. (This is a prudent assumption; the annual return on the Standard & Poor's 500 over the past 70 years, including the Great Depression, is actually 10.19 percent.) If you can save $30 a week ($1,560 a year), after 10 years the value of your portfolio is $29,000. After 20 years, it is $110,000. After 30 years, it is $318,000. Forty years$822,000. And 45 yearsthe normal working lifetime$1.3 million. After 50 years, if you work until age 70, the value of your portfolio crescendoes to an estimated $2 million.<p>
You wouldn't exactly be a millionaire in today's dollars. If we adjust for inflation of about 4 percent a year, your portfolio of $1.3 million after 45 years would be closer to $230,000. That's still a larger nest egg than most working Americans even dream of. With that amount of capital, you could purchase an annuity at age 65 that would give you $18,256 a year (in today's dollars) during your retirement years.<p>
The way to save Social Security is to make the magic of compound interest work for its beneficiaries. I've been developing a proposal that will save Social Securityand enable 100 million Americans to become millionaires. The plan keeps Social Security as a mandatory, redistributive savings program, but it converts the program from the current pay-as-you-go system to a funded system, in which individuals own retirement portfolios at Social Security and choose private investment managers. Individuals would be allowed to set aside portions of their Social Security payments, together with additional voluntary contributions, in their own personal accounts. They could use their accounts for retirement income and pass on the capital tax free to their children. The plan has four basic elements:<p>
Pay existing obligations to all current retirees. Social Security benefits would be paid to all existing retirees, as promised, without changes, and without reductions.<p>
Divide Social Security into two tiers. If you are working now, you and your employer would continue to pay existing Social Security taxes of 12.4 percent on the first $61,200 of your income. Some of that would go to pay the benefits of existing recipients. Some of your payments would go into your own personal account. Payroll taxes would not rise from their current level. They would be cut by 2 percentage points around the year 2040.<p>
The benefits of current retirees would be paid out of the first tiercurrent payroll taxes. When they retire, current workers would draw benefits from two Social Security sources: income from future payroll taxes and income from their personal retirement accounts.<p>
Create personal investment and retirement accounts for the second tier of Social Security. Every worker who earns at least $4,000 would have his own IRA-like account with Social Security. (Unlike an IRA, you could use your account only for retirement, and could not withdraw from it earlier.) The first $500 that you and your employer pay into Social Security every year would be automatically deposited in your personal retirement account. You could increase the deposit in your personal retirement account by up to $3,000 per year by making voluntary contributions that would be matched by Social Security taxes you are already paying. The size of the match would vary according to income.<p>
Here's an example: If you earn $10,000 a year and you contribute $1,240 per year, the first $500 of this money would be paid into your personal account. If you add a savings match of $130, the Social Security program will deposit an additional $610 of tax money you are already paying into the fund into your personal retirement account, for a total of $1,240 per year. In 45 years, your portfolio will be $1,026,524 and you're a millionaire.<p>
If you are making $50,000, you might wish to put the maximum of $3,000 per year into your personal account at Social Security; $1,500 of the $3,000 comes from taxes you are already paying, and $1,500 comes from additional funds you save from your income, that is, from a personal-savings match. In 45 years, your portfolio would be $2.5 million.<p>
This money would be in your name, you would own it, and you would be in charge of picking an investment manager to invest it for you. Social Security would set up a corporation whose only purpose is to certify and approve private-sector money managers. (Criteria would include performance and experience in money management, years in business, and certfiably good character.) You would pick your investment manager from this list, and could switch to a different one any time you wanted. This sort of system is already working well in Chile.<p>
Use your capital account to increase your retirement income, and pass on your assets tax free to your children. When you retire, you would have two attractive choices of what to do with your capital account. One would be to use income from your capital (5 percent a year) for your retirement benefitsand then, when you die, to pass on your entire capital account tax free to your children or heirs. The second would be to purchase an annuity with your capital account, and receive higher retirement benefits during your lifetime but not pass any assets on to your children or heirs. <p>
Based on current life-expectancy charts, when you reach 65 you can expect to live, on average, to age 83, an additional 18 years. With an annuity you could currently receive an estimated 7.9 percent return per year.<p>
If you have a small portfolio when you retire, your Social Security benefits would be paid as promised out of the income from your capital (5 percent a year), as well as payroll taxes from future workers. Suppose, for instance, you have $100,000 in your personal account, and promised Social Security benefits of $10,000 a year. You would receive $5,000 in Social Security income from your capital, and $5,000 through the regular payroll-tax base. When you die, you would then be able to pass your retirement assets on to your children or heirs.<p>
As portfolios grow through compound interest, however, tens of millions of retirees would have the opportunity to increase their benefits. Twenty-year-olds today earning $10,000 a year will retire at age 65 in 2040. If the wages keep up with expected inflation, their final wages will be $15,236. Their promised present-law Social Security benefits will be $9,121 per year (a 59.9 percent replacement level). If payroll taxes are not increased, Social Security benefits would be reduced 24.4 percentfrom $9,121 to $6,892 per year.<p>
Under the Beard system, these retirees would have $1,026,524 in their personal accounts with Social Security ($182,769 in today's money). If they choose an annuity, their Social Security benefits will be $14,511 per year$5,390 higher than present-law Social Security promises. If they wish to pass the $1,026,524 tax free onto their children or heirs, their benefits will be $9,138.<p>
It would be enormously expensive to move from a pay-as-you-go to a funded Social Security system. Annual deposits into personal capital accounts would begin at over $100 billion per year and climb to over $200 billion per year (in today's dollars) by 2040. And this would be in addition to the massive deficits already projected for Social Security beginning in 2013. How can America possibly afford these expenses? The money would come from five sources. <p>
Over time, the largest increase in Social Security revenue would come from the income of the new capital accounts. By 2040, after 45 years in operation, the estimated value of retirees' capital accounts in today's dollars would be $8 trillion, almost double the current value of the private pension system. If we assume 5 percent income from capital to pay retirement benefits, retirees would receive over $400 billion every year from their capital (in today's dollars).<p>
Social Security payroll taxes currently exceed payments by about $25 billion a year. This surplus would go into the personal capital accounts. So would the $475 billion in assets that have supposedly accumulated in the Social Security trust fund. Those assets don't really exist, but workers have paid extra taxes on the federal government's promise that the surplus would go to a trust fund. Amortized over 20 years, the trust fund could be drawn down at the rate of $30 billion a year. In practice, this will mean that other federal expenditures will have to be cut by the same amount, bonds of $30 billion will have to sold to the public, or taxes will have to be raised by $30 billion.<p>
Some $60 billion a year would be saved through a special debt instrument we call the Liberty Bond. The Liberty Bond would be a voluntary 30-year interest-paying instrument. After 30 years, heirs and designees would receive principal and interest tax free. It would be marketed to retirees who do not need all their benefits to enjoy a comfortable retirement, and would gladly forego some of their benefits if they were sure this would help their children.<p>
I anticipate that five to 10 million Americans would purchase Liberty Bonds. Millions of retirees would gladly set aside $1,000 per year to create a $25,000 tax-free education fund for their children and grandchildren. Many would even set aside their full benefits$10,000 to $15,000 a year for their remaining lifetimeto build a nest egg for their children. The government could create a cap of $95 billion per year on the sale of Liberty Bonds, so that no more money is deferred than necessary.<p>
To make the numbers work, benefits will also have to be reduced for future retirees. There are two fair ways to do this. One is to raise the normal retirement age from the current 67 to 70, a change that can be phased in gradually. We are all living longer and we are in better health as we age. It is fair to extend the normal retirement age as our own lifetimes are extended. And in any case, with individual capital accounts in Social Security and the power of compound interest, Americans will want to work longerbecause they'll have the opportunity to build up even larger nest eggs.<p>
The second way to reduce Social Security benefits fairly is to reduce indexation for real wage growth. It is important to index Social Security for inflation. Once you retire, the cost of living continues to rise as a result of inflation. Without cost-of-living adjustments, the purchasing power of your benefits will decrease an estimated 4 percent per year. But Social Security is indexed again for real wage growthabout 1 percent a year. This is icing on the cake for retirees. It is not necessary, and it could be reduced by 50 percent.<p>
The current pay-as-you-go system is an economic, political, and cultural dead end. It will force us to raise taxes, and then raise taxes again to pay promised benefits, or to cut benefits and then cut benefits again to avoid mammoth tax increases. It will create no new capital opportunities. It will drain a growing amount of America's resourcesour savings and investmentout of the private sector. A shrinking private sector damages our ability to create new jobs and new industriesour future strength.<p>
The current system is also a recipe for conflict. If America is a shrinking pie, the young generation and older generation will fight over the crumbs. <p>
Under a funded, two-tier system, we would cut payroll taxes 2 percentage points in 2040 and then cut them again. As the system matures, we would increase retirement benefits by 25 to 35 percent. We would create 100 million millionaires. We would amass unprecedented savings and investment in America by opening the doors of capital ownership to most Americans. We would create a capital pool that no other nation in the world can equal, and use this investment to finance the high-paying jobs and new industries of tomorrow.<p>
By making every American a capitalist, a funded Social Security system would unleash new economic growth, raise the standard of living of our children, and return America to its historic role as the country of tomorrow, with its best days yet to come.

<p>
<br>
One of the most refreshing feelings in the new Washington is the growing  
sense that our current tax system is not long for this world.  
<p>	 
Only days after the November election, Congressman Bill Archer, the  
chairman of the House tax-writing committee, boldly declared his desire  
to "tear out the income tax by its roots." House Speaker Newt Gingrich  
and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole have since formed a commission   
to consider entirely new alternatives. Presidential candidates Phil Gramm,  
Richard Lugar, and Arlen Specter want to scrap the system. A half dozen  
congressional panels are holding hearings on the subject. Even  
Congressman Richard Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, has  
floated a major rewrite (albeit without details).   
<p> 
The question is no longer whether America will get rid of its burdensome  
tax system; the question is, what new system should we replace it with? It  
is a question that will likely dominate our politics through the next  
election.  
<p>
<center>
<b><a name="The Contenders">THE CONTENDERS</a></b><br>  

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
There are three main contenders: One is a plan advanced by Senators  
Sam Nunn and Pete Domenici. They were among the earliest to call  
attention to the most economically lunatic feature of the current tax code  
-- the highly destructive double taxation of savings -- and develop a   
way to fix it. Called the "USA Tax," their proposal, while fairly  
complicated, defers taxation on income that is saved, while taxing income  
that is used for consumption. It is a sincere and innovative effort to  
encourage the savings necessary for continued economic growth.  
<p>	 
The second contender, which I strongly favor, is the flat tax. Designed to  
make the tax system as neutral and simple as possible, the flat tax would  
sweep away all loopholes, deductions, and exemptions, and replace them   
with a single generous personal allowance. All other income would be  
taxed at one low rate of 17 percent. As the plan's authors, economists  
Robert E. Hall and Alvin Rabushka, have pointed out, a flat tax would  
allow Americans to figure their taxes on a form the size of a postcard.  
The use of the tax code by would-be social engineers would end. Like the  
USA Tax, the flat tax would also end the double taxation of saving.  
<p>	 
While support for the flat tax is soaring -- almost 60 percent of  
Americans appear to favor a version of it, if polls are to be believed -- the  
Nunn-Domenici plan may have been overtaken by events. Conceived at a  
time when it appeared to many that the redistributionist Democratic Party  
would control Congress indefinitely, the plan contains sharply  
progressive tax rates that would kick in at surprisingly low income levels.  
It addresses the disincentive to save quite well, but it may make the other  
problems in the code, high rates and complexity, even worse than the  
current system. With the new politics in Washington and across the  
country, superior alternatives are now clearly within political reach.  
<p>	 
Then there's choice number three: the national sales tax. This is a  
sweeping plan to wipe away the current system and replace it with an  
unprecedented federal tax on retail purchases. Although it's not as widely  
discussed as the flat tax, it has substantial support among many far- 
thinking conservatives, including Archer and Lugar. Indeed, there are   
few conservative hearts that could not be at least a little warmed by its  
central promise to end the income tax altogether.   
<p>	 
This last choice demands serious examination at the moment. Although  
well-intentioned, the sales-tax option has several serious flaws. Before  
getting into that, though, we must remember that supporters of all these  
plans are allies in a fight to end America's single greatest impediment to  
achieving its possibilities: the IRS code, circa 1995.  
<p>	 
Any American tax system should meet three basic criteria. It should be  
fair, simple, and pro-growth. The current system fails miserably on all  
three counts.   
<p>	 
Is it simple? Not by a long shot. In 1990, American workers and  
businesses spent 5.4 billion hours preparing their taxes for the  
government. That's more time than it takes to build every car, truck, and  
van manufactured in the United States each year. After seven decades of  
amendments, revisions, exemptions, loopholes, and extensions, the code  
has become an incoherent mess. The IRS now sends out eight billion  
pages of forms and instructions each year. Laid end to end, they would  
stretch 28 times around the circumference of the earth.  
<p>	 
Is it fair? Hardly. The tax system is as much an exercise in social  
engineering as it is a way of raising government revenue efficiently.  
Through its exemptions and loopholes, the government tries to guide the  
economic decisions of free Americans in the misguided belief that the   
government knows best. Among other things, the code tells us that it is  
better to invest in a municipal sewer system than the next Microsoft, that  
buying rather than renting a home is a better choice for everyone  
everywhere, that purchasing air compressors is better than buying  
computer software. Government has neither the competence nor the right  
to make those decisions for us. The pretense that "government knows   
best" is an insult to our citizens.  
<p>	 
Is it pro-growth? As written, the tax code actually punishes savings and  
investment, by placing double or even triple tax burdens on capital. This  
lowers wages, destroys jobs, and depresses the living standards of all  
Americans. At the same time, it burdens American workers with  
punishingly high tax rates and overall tax burdens. With state and local   
taxes and other federal taxes, Americans now pay more in taxes than they  
spend on food, clothing, and shelter combined.  
<p>	 
All who have worked to end this system, no matter what plan they  
currently favor, should be welcomed as members of the tax-reform  
movement.   
<p>	 
Now for a closer look at option number three. What follows is my  
assessment of the major arguments advanced in favor of the national sales  
tax:  
<p>	 
<b>A sales tax is not an income tax.</b> The case for a sales tax begins with one  
highly appealing applause line. It will allow us, supporters argue, to  
eliminate the income tax altogether, possibly even repealing the 16th  
Amendment, which authorized it and made Big Government possible in   
the first place.   
<p>	 
Even if that goal were politically feasible -- and I don't think it is -- the  
exchange would come at a high price. We would give up the income tax  
for a more intrusive and pervasive tax system.  
<p>	 
The reason is simple. If the government sets out to collect a new tax at  
the cash register, it will soon have no choice but to extend that tax  
beyond the retailer to every level of production, as it desperately tries to  
stop inevitable and massive tax evasion. Any sales tax will become a  
complex, pervasive, multi-rate, value-added tax. We will soon be living   
under a VAT -- possibly the most insidious tax scheme ever devised.  
<p>	 
Sales-tax backers often oppose a VAT. But that's what they'll get. To  
generate sufficient revenue by taxing goods only at the retail level, the  
government would need to impose a sales tax of at least 20 percent,  
which means that consumers would suddenly find that everything they  
buy appears to be 20 percent more expensive. But people will not pay  
such a high tax. They will either find ways to label their consumer goods  
tax-exempt wholesale items, they will purchase goods in a cash black  
market, or they will evade it some other way. A sales tax, in other words,  
will be immediately undermined by a silent tax revolt, and the  
government -- following the pattern of European countries -- will respond  
by imposing a VAT.  
<p>	 
A VAT is assessed at each stage of production and is much easier to  
collect and enforce for a host of reasons. You can hear the bureaucratic  
lament in a 1993 report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation  
and Development, which noted: "Governments have gone on record as  
saying that an RST [retail sales tax] of more than 10 percent to 12 percent  
is too fragile to tax evasion possibilities, and it is probably not entirely  
accidental that in OECD counties, VAT rates are nearly always above 12  
percent and that, except in Canada and Iceland, RST rates have always  
been well below 12 percent."   
<p>	 
These unhappy governments were speaking from sad experience. In  
1967, 21 developed countries had retail, wholesale, manufacturer, or  
multi-stage sales taxes. Today, 20 out of 21 of these sales taxes have  
become value-added taxes. Every developed country except Australia  
that has had a sales tax now has a VAT. (Even Canada and Iceland,   
mentioned as exceptions when the OECD report was written, have since  
replaced their retail-tax-only systems with VATs.)  
<p>	 
Whether or not the sales tax evolves into a VAT, the government would  
become intimately involved in almost every economic transaction  
between consenting adults. The simplest exchange, from a vegetable  
farmer selling his produce to the corner grocer selling a loaf of bread,  
would be under the shadow of a government tax collector taking his cut.  
In fact, every businessperson in America would become a tax collector  
for the government.  
<p>	 
"But businesses already collect taxes for the government," sales-tax  
supporters counter. There's a big difference. Today, businesses collect a  
relatively small share of the income tax, since three quarters of the  
income in the economy is labor income, paid by individuals. But under a  
sales tax, there is no direct tax on individuals, so businesses will be  
responsible for collecting several times what they collect today. That  
means IRS scrutiny of American businesses could be expected to rise  
proportionately. Since the 10-12 million businesses in America have  
fewer rights under law than individuals, we can expect IRS abuses to rise   
exponentially as well.  
<p>	 
It would be an administrative mess. A national sales tax may well exempt  
many basic necessities from tax --beginning with food and clothing.  
This would lead to bitter disputes over the difference between food and  
candy, between real clothes and costume accessories. Congress and   
the courts would likely find themselves debating the nutritional value of  
Twinkies, the body coverage of sportswear, and much else, just as state  
governments do today, but on a larger scale.  
<p>	 
Worse, the federal sales tax and the dozens of different state sales taxes --  
aside from having different tax rates -- would likely exempt different  
items. That means a small businessperson would need to look up the  
correct state sales-tax rate, apply the federal rate, subtract the state tax  
rate from items exempted only by the state, or subtract only the federal  
rate from items federal-only exempted. Then he would need to do  
separate calculations for each of the states in which he does business.  
(And he would need to catch any mistakes before the tax enforcer  
appears.)  
<p>	 
The likely consequence would be a slowdown in business activity -- and  
a loss of jobs and drop in wages for millions of American workers.   
<p>	 
<b>We could eliminate the IRS.</b> Ignoring or dismissing this inevitable  
tendency for a sales tax to become an all-pervasive VAT -- with a huge  
accompanying bureaucracy -- some sales-tax advocates nevertheless  
argue that the sales tax would allow us to eliminate the IRS altogether.  
<p>	 
The argument is presented with an interesting federalist twist. The states,  
they say, could collect the new federal sales tax through their existing  
sales-tax systems. The federal government, then, could do without its  
own revenue collection agency. We could bring about the ultimate   
devolution of federal authority.  
<p>	 
One immediate problem, however, is that five states do not have a sales  
tax and would not take kindly to enforcing one for Washington. Even  
those that do would consider the costs of collecting a huge federal sales  
tax (the main source of federal revenue) an unbearable federal   
mandate.  
<p>
The enforcement costs for current sales taxes, currently about 5 percent,  
are manageable. However, if you add a 20 percent federal sales tax on top  
of that, the compliance problems grow exponentially. It makes little   
sense for a state government to pay the enforcement costs for a 25  
percent tax when it only gets one fifth of the revenue. Many states would  
simply eliminate their sales taxes.  
<p>	 
But the point is purely academic. For reasons dating back to the unhappy  
years of the Articles of Confederation, the federal government will never  
rely on state governments for its prime source of revenue. It will not  
happen.  
<p>	 
In truth, a sales tax would not eliminate any federal agency. It will  
actually allow a huge increase in the size of the federal government by  
allowing politicians to raise taxes with relative impunity. Why? Because  
sales taxes are hidden from the taxpayers, concealed in the price of the  
goods they buy.  
<p>	 
Try this experiment. Stand outside a grocery store and ask shoppers as  
they leave how much they just paid in sales tax. You'll find that virtually  
no one knows. Can you guess how much you paid in sales tax last month,  
or last year? The problem is, if people don't appreciate how much they  
pay in taxes, it is a lot easier for politicians to raise them.  
<p>	 
<b>Individuals would no longer need to file tax forms with the government.</b>
Since people would pay their taxes whenever they purchase an item,  
some sales-tax advocates argue, the government will never need to know  
a taxpayer's name. There would be no filing of any tax papers at all by an   
individual.  
<p>	 
That's not quite right. Under almost any sales-tax plan, individuals would  
still file with the government -- but for entirely different reasons than  
they do today.  
<p>	 
It's almost certain that one way or another, any federal sales tax would  
need to exempt certain basic necessities in order to make it progressive.  
One way to do this, as I've mentioned above, would be to order retailers  
not to charge tax on food and clothing and whatever else the government   
selects.   
<p>	 
But exempting a handful of items isn't enough. Absent a generous rebate,  
most Americans would face a stiff tax increase under a sales tax. That's  
why most sales-tax proposals provide for a rebate. The truth is, the   
overwhelming majority of Americans would still need to file with the IRS  
to claim their rebate (or else face a substantial tax increase).   
<p>	 
Some have suggested the IRS could simply send out checks to every  
American by Social Security number, obviating the need for taxpayers to  
file with the IRS. This is a fantasy. It wouldn't be long before there were  
more Social Security numbers than citizens. Whether or not Americans   
file directly with the IRS, the potential for fraud is staggering. Even under  
the current Earned Income Tax Credit program, fraud levels are as high  
as 30 to 40 percent. How much fraud would there be if the federal  
government were cutting thousand-dollar checks to every American?  
<p>	  
Of even greater concern is the political dynamic that would develop once  
we couple a hidden sales tax with a highly visible tax rebate. Americans  
would be quietly nickel-and-dimed to death by a sales tax they may  
hardly notice, but every year a very noticeable and generous check would  
arrive from Washington like manna from heaven. Government, and even  
the tax bureaucracy, might become highly popular after all. And in my  
judgment, if there could be anything worse then people hating the IRS, it  
would be for people to love the IRS.	  
<p>	 
<b>A sales tax will tax the underground economy.</b> The notion here is that a  
sales tax will more effectively tax illicit trade in both legal and illegal  
goods and services than any income tax. If true, this would bring in tens  
of billions of dollars in revenue to the government as we collect revenue   
from people who are currently outside the system.  
<p>	 
The neighborhood drug dealer almost always serves as the illustration.  
Since the drug dealer declines to file a 1040 form, the argument runs,  
maybe we could at least recoup some of his income through a sales tax.  
The government may have no record that he exists, but when he uses his  
blood money to buy a sports car, the government will collect tax from  
him.  
<p>	 
That sounds compelling at first, but if we think it through, it doesn't hold  
together. Look at it this way: Both systems will equally fail to tax the  
drug trade for the simple reason that the drug dealer will not play along in  
either one. If there's an income tax in place, he won't report his income. If  
there's a sales tax in place, he won't collect tax from his customers. Either  
way, the government loses exactly the same amount of money.  
<p>	 
Consider the following example. Suppose there is a drug dealer who  
makes $50,000 in sales to his customers every year and then turns around  
and spends it. Under an income tax system, we wish to tax the income of  
the dealer and his customers, while under a sales tax we wish to tax all of  
their purchases.  
<p>	 
Under the income tax, we tax the income of the drug consumers  
(assuming they are law-abiding citizens besides their drug use), but we  
can't tax the income of the drug dealer. Thus we lose $50,000 from the  
tax base. Under the sales tax, we tax the purchases of the drug dealer, but  
we don't tax the purchases of the drug consumers. Loss to the tax   
base: $50,000.  
<p>	 
It has to be the case that neither system taxes the value of the drug trade  
because the amount people spend on drugs must equal the income of the  
drug dealer. And since the drug dealer will not report sales or income tax,  
neither system will capture the value of the drug trade.   
<p>	 
The same would hold true for the underground economy in legal goods  
and services as well -- which, of course, is much larger. The proverbial  
plumber who doesn't report his house-call income today would not report  
it for sales-tax purposes either. At best, it will be a wash.  
<p> 	 
Actually, economic reasoning aside, the whole "underground economy"  
argument for a sales tax is flawed. It's obvious that if we try to impose a  
national sales tax of 20 percent or more on the public, the underground  
economy will explode. The "contraband" involved, though, will not be  
just crack cocaine, but virtually any sort of consumer good. That's   
exactly what happened in Canada when the government imposed its  
goods-and-services tax. The tax raised much less than projected.  
Coincidentally, the Canadian Treasury soon noticed a dramatic increase  
in the amount of real currency flowing through the economy. Why were  
Canadians suddenly using so much cash? Guess.  
<p>	 
<b>A sales tax will reduce the trade deficit.</b> Supporters say that a sales tax  
will increase U.S. competitiveness by taxing imports and not taxing  
exports. As tax-policy people put it, a sales tax is "border adjustable."  
Since exports aren't sold in the U.S., they would escape a domestic sales  
tax; since foreign imports are sold here, they will get hit. This way,  
American firms receive a significant tax advantage over foreign firms,  
and that will favorably alter our trade balance.  
<p> 
There are very few economists who hold this view, however. An  
immutable law of economics holds that trade surpluses and deficits are  
linked to the amount a nation lends or borrows. When savings are low,  
the trade deficit must be high, but if we substituted a tax on imports for  
some other tax, it will not affect the amount Americans save. That means   
the trade deficit not only will stay the same, it must stay the same, as a  
basic principle of economics.  
<p>	 
Economists might explain it this way (simplifying, of course): If there is  
more investment occurring in our economy than can be financed by our  
savings, then foreign investors must be accounting for the difference. In  
effect, they are taking the money we pay them for their cars and VCRs  
and using it to buy our stocks and bonds, thus supplying the investment  
capital that we don't supply ourselves. This difference is the "trade  
deficit."   
<p>	 
The only way to change the trade deficit, then, is to change our savings  
rate. If we increase our savings relative to our domestic investment, we  
will have less need for foreign cash. The trade deficit will then drop, as  
we spend relatively less money buying foreign goods and relatively more   
investing at home.  
<p>	 
But anything we do to tax incoming foreign goods -- including slapping  
them with a sales tax -- will have no effect on the amount of money  
Americans are putting into domestic stocks and bonds or even their own  
bank accounts. There is simply no relationship between them.  
<p>	 
What will happen instead is this: Our exports will increase at first because  
of the new tax advantage. But since our savings will remain the same, the  
dollar will be artificially strengthened. This will make our exports more   
expensive, and the original balance of trade will be gradually restored --  
along with the original trade deficit. The policy will be self-defeating.  
<p>	 
Even if a border adjustment were to work as its proponents claim, it  
would still be a bad idea. It would make the goods Americans buy --  
whether produced here in America or abroad -- more expensive, while  
foreigners could purchase American-made goods more cheaply. It's hard  
to see how Americans benefit from paying higher prices than foreigners  
do to purchase American products.  
<p>	 
Adam Smith makes a relevant point in The Wealth of Nations. Smith  
reminds us, "Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production;  
and the interest of the producer bought to be attended to, only so far as it  
may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer."  
<p>	 
In a border-adjustable system, however, to borrow from Smith again, "the  
interest of the consumer is almost constantly sacrificed to that of the  
producer; and it seems to consider production, and not consumption, as  
the ultimate end and object of all industry and commerce."

<p>
All of the above assumes, of course, that we really could replace the  
income-tax system with a national sales tax. But could we? The roots of  
the income tax go back to the 16th Amendment, passed in 1916 to  
authorize the government to levy a tax on individual incomes. In my  
view, repealing the amendment and ending the income tax for good   
is, politically, not in the cards. Conservatives in Congress have tried for  
years to pass a balanced-budget amendment without success. I believe we  
will eventually succeed, but in the midst of that grueling fight, I believe  
the notion of getting 290 members of the House, 67 members of the  
Senate, and three quarters of the states to repeal the 16th Amendment is a   
dream.  
<p>	 
And that is perhaps the best argument against the sales tax. If we try to  
exchange an income tax for a sales tax, we could easily end up with both.  
It would be a tragic irony if conservatives who favor a smaller  
government unwittingly provide the liberals with a comprehensive new  
taxing authority without eliminating the old one.

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	 
We must not lose sight of the commendable motives behind the sales tax.  
Its supporters want a tax code that does not interfere with economic  
decisionmaking, minimizes the paperwork burdens on the taxpayers,  
limits the size of the federal government, avoids excessive taxes on  
savings and investment, and is straightforward and fair.  
<p>	 
For all the above reasons, however, the sales tax is not likely to achieve  
those goals. The flat tax, however, will do so. By placing a single tax rate  
on all income, it will not distort economic decisions. Citizens will be free  
to spend and invest their money as they see fit without taking tax  
considerations into account. The paperwork burden, for most taxpayers,  
will be reduced to filling out a postcard-sized tax return. Americans will  
get an honest bill and know how much their government costs them.  
Savings and investment income will be taxed, but only once. The  
punitive double taxation of savings in the current code will be gone. The  
flat tax meets the tax-reform criteria -- it is simple, fair, and pro-growth.

<p>
National Minority Politics is published monthly by Richberg Communications, Inc.  The magazine and this World Wide Web site are founded on the following principles:<p>
 




<ol>
  <b><li>Strong Families.</b> The foundation of any stable society is -- first and foremost -- strong families in every community.  We should stress to our youth the importance of marriage and keeping families together.<p>

  <b><li>Individual responsibility.</b> Almost every human being is endowed with the necessary means to be successful -- a sound mind and the ability to think, reason and make choices.  These natural gifts are accompanied with the equal obligation to take responsibility for one's actions.<p>

  <b><li>Free enterprise.</b> Our nation has been the most successful on earth in fostering and promoting a free enterprise system with opportunity for all.  Strengthening this system is our best hope for a thriving economy in the future.
<p>
  <b><li>Less government.</b> The size and influence of government at all levels must be minimized in order to guarantee a free society.  Government should play a role in performing certain functions, like maintaining a strong defense, but we should not expect government to solve all our problems.<p>

  <b><li>Strong Defense.</b> While it is not America's role to be the world's policeman, there are sometimes threats to American lives and interests which we cannot tolerate.<p>

  <b><li>Community-based problem solving</b> Rather than looking to the federal government to solve local problems, such as crime and education, we can and should develop solutions in our local communities.<p>

  <b><li>Good taste and common sense in popular culture.</b> The level of violence, promiscuous sex and immoral behavior on television, in movies and in music lyrics should be reduced as it has adverse effects on society, especially our children.<p>

  <b><li>Compassionate conservatism.</b> While stressing the importance of free enterprise and less government, we must recognize our responsibility as a society to help those who help themselves, or who are unable to help themselves through no fault of their own.<p>
</ol>

<P>
<ul>
<a name="powell"></a><li> Colin Powell's Nov. 8 decision not to run-for president closes
one chapter of the 1996 presidential sweepstakes, but opens many
others. Although the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
ruled it out, there is still a possibility that he may be asked
to join the Republican ticket in the vice presidential slot. And
his name is already being touted as a presidential candidate in
the year 2000
<P>
Let's analyze some of the reaction to the potential Powell campaign,
before <I>and</I> after Nov. 8.
<P>
<B>Before.</B>  Several, days before Powell's announcement, leaders
of 10 conservative groups held a press conference warning the
retired general not to run and vowing to oppose him if he did
&quot;Any candidacy by Colin Powell must be stopped. He will be
stopped,&quot; said Morton Blackwell, the Republican National
Committeman from Virginia.
<P>
Blackwell also went as far to suggest that some conservatives
were promoting Powell only because he is black &quot;If General
Powell were a white general holding these views, they would not
consider for a moment supporting him for our party's nomination,&quot;
he said.
<P>
Others attending the press conference and supporting this view
included Paul Weyrich of the Free Congress Foundation and National
Empowerment Television, David Keane of the Conservative Political
Action Comrnittee, Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform,
and Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council.
<P>
This move by some party conservatives was the most hypocritical
and preposterous in recent memory. First, for people who like
to tout their pro-America credentials, it is exceptionally un-American
and undemocratic to suggest that any American is barred from seeking
public office. If he or she is unacceptable, it's up to the voters
to decide, not for a self-appointed band of litmus testers to
try to scare people out of running.
<P>
Several black conservatives were asked to participate in this
charade, including the publisher and editor of <I>National Minority
Politics</I>. 
<P>
But the response and receptiveness (or lack thereof) to Powell's
potential candidacy helped smoke out some of the elements in the
Republican Party who are most strident and resistant to expanding
the party's base. This was one positive outcome of otherwise deplorable
behavior on the part of some patty activists.
<P>
Time magazine reports that House Speaker Newt Gingrich met privately
with Powell Nov. 2 and encouraged him to run, saying &quot;a campaign
would succeed-but only if Powell wanted it very badly.&quot; Without
endorsing Powell Gingrich encouraged him and told him they could
work as a team Powell also had conversations with former Presidents
Ford, Bush and Carter prior to making his final decision. The
broad range of support Powell received, from former Presidents
to lay persons, demonstrates his appeal across party and ideological
lines.
<P>
<B>After.</B>  One newspaper, the <I>Concord (N.H.) Monitor</I>,
said of the Powell decision: &quot;Powell made the right decision
for the right reason. . . If we were President Clinton, we would
seize the chance and call on him to lead a bipartisan, broadly
representative commission on race relations.&quot;
<P>
It is an indication of how far we have to go concerning stereotypes
and pigeon-holing of our nation's black citizens that a major
American newspaper would even suggest reducing a four-star general
to the status of race merchant.
<P>
In response to Powell's announcement that he was joining the Republican
Party, the Rev. Jesse Jackson said the general took a &quot;step
backward&quot; by aligning with the GOP. Noting GOP plans to cut
popular federal programs for the poor, Jackson said Powell will
have to do &quot;some very heavy lifting to meet his goal of making
the party more attractive to black voters.&quot;
<P>
Jackson's reaction reveals two important things about his approach
to politics. One, his view that it is a a step backward&quot;
for a man of Powell's stature to work toward two-party participation
by black Americans demonstrates the Reverend's idea of &quot;progress&quot;
is for all blacks to walk in lock step behind Democratic leaders.
<P>
Two, his view that Powell will have to change the GOP by himself
places an unreasonable expectation on the retired general's shoulders.
After all, Jackson has been in the Democratic Party for years
and they Still refuse to accept him as their standard bearer.
Perhaps he should do some &quot;heavy lifting&quot; of his own
in the Democratic Party.
<P>
Powell's son Michael, in an interview with Time magazine following
Powell's Nov. 8 press conference, said the retired general might
be persuaded to accept a spot on the GOP ticket if asked by the
nominee. &quot;I wouldn't be surprised one bit if he was in government
again as a secretary of something or even vice president,&quot;
said the younger Powell.
<P>
And some of Powell's supporters have not yet thrown in the towel.
Some Powell partisans are organizing a massive write-in campaign
and pinning their hopes on a win in New Hampshire to coax Powell
to join the Republican field.
<P>
California Citizens for Powell Chair Emmett Cash III said, &quot;If
the people of New Hampshire write him in great numbers, he will
be the next President of the United States. New Hampshire is the
key to this election for Colin Powell.&quot; But it might be best
to respect Powell's wishes--for now. He doesn't want to be a candidate
this year. After 35 years of service to his country, he deserves
a break.
<P>
<a name="collins"></a><li> In a surprise announcement, Rep. Cardiss Collins (D-Il.), the
longest serving black woman in Congress and a Chicago political
power, said she will retire. Since being elected to succeed her
late husband in 1973, Collins has handily won election after election.
Collins, in a Washington, D.C. press conference, said, &quot;The
main factor in stepping down is I'D be 65 years old next year.
I believe you know in your life when its time to make a change.&quot;
<P>
Collins said she considered retiring in 1994. The 7th Congressional
District which she represents contains the Loop and most of the
North Michigan corridor and the Near North Side, with the infamous
Cabrini-Green housing project. It also goes south, past the Century
Prairie Avenue mansions to the Taylor homes and takes in a few
heavily black South Side neighborhoods.
<P>
Collins played a pivotal role in remapping Illinois' congressional
districts after the 1990 census, demanding that her district retain
the Loop. &quot;It has been frustrating moving from the majority
to the minority, but that's not the reason I'm leaving,&quot;
said Collins. &quot;I've enjoyed fighting the Republicans, quite
frankly.&quot;
<P>
Her retirement set off a stampede of would-be successors.
<P>
<a name="jj"></a><li> Two-time presidential candidate Jesse Jackson said Nov. 9 he's
thinking anew about running in 1996 now that retired Gen. Colin
Powell has ruled out a potential White House bid.
<P>
The Associated Press reported that less than 24 hours after Powell
announced he would not run, Jackson said at a news conference
that he has met with his advisers over the past few days to ''assess
the landscape.&quot;
<P>
&quot;I still have the fire in my belly and clear vision in my
head about what a president ought to do to make the nation better,&quot;
said the founder of the National Rainbow Coalition and presidential
candidate of 1984 and 1988.
<P>
Jackson said it was premature to say when he would reach a decision.
<P>
But while criticizing what he said was Clinton's inattention to
urban issues, Jackson suggested he would stay on the political
sidelines if the president begins to pay more attention to cities
and racial inequities.
<P>
&quot;I feel that Clinton, if he focuses on the covenant, honors
it and addresses those people who elected him, he could be elected
again. But if he abandons that base then that base has no allegiance
to him,&quot; he said.
<P>
Jackson said it would be difficult for him to run in the Democratic
primaries and that an independent candidacy would be the only
way to &quot;open the process up.&quot;
<P>
<a name="cv"></a><li> President Clinton emerged the clear winner in CityVote, the
presidential preference balloting that lumped together declared
and potential candidates, independents and party members on Election
Day.
<P>
210,000 votes were cast in 13 cities, including Tucson, Ariz.
and Fayette, Mo. In the Nov. 7 non-binding urban primary, Clinton
drew 43.7 percent. Colin Powell came in second with 18.2 percent
and Sen. Bob Dole finished third with 11.9 percent.
<P>
The rest received votes in this order: Steve Forbes, Ross Perot,
Pat Buchanan, Phil Gramm and Jesse Jackson. Republican presidential
hopefuls Lamar Alexander, Sen. Arlen Specter and Sen. Dick Lugar
rarely, if at all, exceeded 1 percent.
<P>
Twenty-one names in all appeared on the ballot. Legal challenges
prevented several bigger cities, including Boston, Baltimore and
Newark, from participating. CityVote also was plagued by pressures
from the
<P>
Democratic National Committee, which sought to have Clinton's
name struck from the ballot.
<P>
<a name="banks"></a><li> Banks may have lost a defense against redlining charges.
<P>
Two economists with the Federal National Mortgage Association
said earlier studies erred in supporting a reason often given
for lender avoidance of low-income neighborhoods, according to
a report in American Banker.
<P>
The idea that home values in such neighborhoods tend to fall is
mistaken, the researchers found. In fact, they said, home values
in poorer areas have actually gone up, while those in affluent
areas have slipped.
<P>
Their study indicates that bankers, in avoiding low-income neighborhoods,
lack an economic justification they could cite before to counter
fair-lending charges. Now they must focus on the credit histories
and incomes of particular applicants--rather than the area in
which they live. That is much harder to do.
<P>
The economists, Eric Rosenblat and Ying Li, in a paper presented
Oct. 24 to the Society of Government Economists, said the flaw
in earlier studies was a reliance on demographic information that
wound up having no correlation to housing values.
<P>
The earlier studies looked at the number of welfare recipients
and the number of vacant homes in an area to explain why bankers
did not lend in certain communities.
<P>
Many economists have questioned the validity of those studies,
arguing that bankers consider only the borrower and the house
when making loans. Community characteristics such as the number
of welfare recipients don't matter, they said.
<P>
The Fannie Mae study is the first research project to formally
rebut the prior findings.
<P>
The researchers based their conclusion on data collected by Fannie
Mae and the Federal Home Mortgage Corp. that covered housing purchases
in California--including Los Angeles, Anaheim and Oakland. They
limited their review to homes that changed hands at least twice
between 1986 and 1994.</ul>

<p><a name="general"></a><br><p>
<a href="#table">Table of Contents</a><p>
<ul><li>	General Colin Powell is clearly in the throes of a media lovefest regarding his potential presidential candidacy.  His autobiography, My American Journey, was released Sept. 15 with an initial print run of 800,000 copies.  It is expected to shoot to the top of the bestsellers' lists almost immediately.
	<P>About 3,000 fans jammed into a large bookstore and lined up for blocks as Powell launched his book-promotion tour in McLean, Va., a wealthy Washington, D.C. suburb, by appearing to sign his autobiography.
	<P>In a new CNN/Time poll released Sept. 15, 53 percent said they wanted to see Powell run for president.  He ran ahead of President Clinton in a two-way match up and was in a statistical dead heat with Clinton in a hypothetical Dole-Clinton-Powell race.
	<P>An in-depth profile/interview with Barbara Walters on ABC's "20/20" aired the same day the poll was released.  Other television interviews with the major networks will follow.  Powell has been on the cover of Time, Newsweek and U.S. News & World Report in the last few weeks.  And, as he embarks on his multi-city book tour that runs through October, the media hype will continue.
	<P>But don't expect it to last.  Remember 1992 and Ross Perot's budding presidential bid?  Perot's potential candidacy was touted as the second coming--until he actually got into the race.  In particular, the poll showing Powell would best both Clinton and Dole is eerily reminiscent of a similar poll in 1992 showing Perot leading both Clinton and then President Bush.  Then the negative media barrage ensued with charges of "inspector Perot" and innuendos that the Texas businessman's elevator didn't go all the way to the top.  <P>
	Granted, Perot didn't help his cause with his on-again/off-again campaign.  But the media frenzy damaged his reputation, perhaps irreparably.
	<P>We did learn a few things about Powell that we didn't know, however, from the Walters interview.  For starters, Powell appears to be comfortable with the economic conservatives of the Republican Party, but not quite as comfortable with some of the more strident social conservatives.  Although, in the rush to judgment, his positions on the issues have already been mischaracterized by some conservatives and members of the press, Powell appears to be:
<ul><LI>Pro-choice, but not pro-abortion;
<li>Against quotas and racial preferences, but favors reaching out to economically and socially disadvantaged individuals, regardless of race;
<LI>Solidly for 2nd Amendment rights of gun ownership, but willing to be slightly incon-venienced with registration and/or waiting periods;
<LI>Supportive of a private moment in school for prayer at the students' choosing, but would not support mandatory school prayer; and
<LI>Uncomfortable with the Clinton administration's vacillations on foreign policy issues.
</ul>	<P>Powell has a commanding presidential presence.  He dwarfs the other candidates, both in terms of his life's achievements and the charisma he possesses.  
	<P>At least one of the other GOP presidential candidates has commented on Powell's chances to get the party nomination.  "Despite the political yearnings of pro-abortion Republicans and much of the national news media, retired Army Gen. Colin Powell has not a prayer of winning the GOP nomination," Alan Keyes told USA Today in an interview.  
	<P>Keyes concluded that Powell has a "good background and he's accomplished a lot in his life, but he doesn't seem to have thought through the public policy issues.  Being a good man and being a good president are not necessarily the same thing."
<p>	But it is likely, if Keyes had his druthers, he'd prefer to have poll numbers like Powell, than the 1 to 2 percent national support which the two-time U.S. Senate candidate currently garners.
	<P>Nevertheless, Powell should think long and hard before entering the race.  The media, in their rush to make mere mortals of men, have so tarnished the character of our political leaders that we have few, if any, heroes remaining--living or dead.  The former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with his reputation intact on the sidelines, may serve as much of a purpose for Americans as he would after being sullied by the whole campaign process.
<P>

<a name="jesse"></a><br>
<P><a href="#table">Table of Contents</a><P>
<LI>  Advisers to the Rev. Jesse Jackson disclosed recently that he has submitted his name to be included as a presidential candidate in a nonbinding urban presidential primary called City Vote, to be held in November, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.
	<P>Jackson is contemplating a challenge to President Clinton from within the Democratic Party, but is giving more serious thought to running as an independent.  City Vote is a privately financed effort to give greater prominence to the urban issues Jackson advocates by allowing voters in some 20 cities to cast a nonbinding vote for presidential preference at the time they vote in local elections this November.
	<P>Jackson's aides said he is putting his name on the City Vote ballot both to raise the profile of urban problems and as a way to keep his personal political options open.
	<P>The head of the National Rainbow Coalition announced Sept. 9 that he had raised the $150,000 he owed the FEC from his 1988 presidential campaign, removing one of the obstacles to a potential return to the presidential trail next year.  Had he not paid the settlement, Jackson would not be eligible to receive federal matching campaign funds in future races.
<P>	"All options are alive," said Jackson at a press conference.  He outlined three possible political courses of action for himself in 1996--to stay out of the race, to challenge Clinton in the Democratic primaries or to run as an independent.  
	<P>He noted, however, that he second option was "remote" and that he would wait until the spring to decide on an independent run.  Jackson said that part of his decision would be based on whether Clinton "embraces an activist agenda" for urban development, education and health, as well as enforcement of affirmative action laws.

<a name="georgia"></a><br><p>
<a href="#table">Table of Contents</a><p>
<Li>   Efforts by the Georgia legislature to redraw the state's congressional district map collapsed Sept. 12, leaving the task to a three-judge federal panel.
	After overwhelmingly rejecting two proposed compromise redistricting plans during that week, both houses of the General Assembly voted to adjourn, following a five-week special session that cost the taxpayers at least $500,000.  "I hate to admit failure, but I don't know anything else to do," state House Speaker Tom Murphy, a Democrat, was quoted as saying by the Associated Press.  And state House Reapportionment Committee Chairman Tommy Smith said earlier, "I see absolutely no hope of the conferees passing any plan out on this congressional exercise."
	<P>The special session was called Aug. 14 after the U.S. Supreme Court in late June ruled that the majority-black 11th District of Democratic Rep. Cynthia McKinney was unconstitutional.
	<P>The justices said the legislature had relied too heavily on race in creating the seat following the 1990 census.  The 11th District stretches 250 miles from Savannah to Atlanta in an effort to pick up black voters.
<P>	But, during the special session, the legislature found itself badly split among competing demands from white Democrats, black Democrats and Republicans.
	<P>The black Democrats wanted to retain at least two of the state's current three majority-black House districts.  The Republicans, who now control the other eight districts in the state, feared dilution of their numbers.
	<P>The latest compromise plan, rejected Sept. 11 by a 122-22 vote in the state House and 44-8 in the state Senate, would have left Democratic Rep. John Lewis as the only one of the state's three black incumbents with a majority-black district.
<P>	Republicans disliked the plan because it would have placed House Speaker Gingrich and GOP Rep. Bob Barr in the same Atlanta-area district.  And black legislators objected because it failed to keep McKinney's district from intruding on the 5th District represented by Democratic Rep. John Lewis, and because it removed a key part of the majority-black district of Democratic Rep. Sanford Bishop.
	<P>The new congressional map will now be drawn by the same three-judge federal panel that originally threw out the 11th District.
<P>
   
<a name="welfare"></a><br>
<P>
<a href="#table">Table of Contents</a><P>
<LI>The prospects for ending welfare as we know it were dashed with the caving in of moderate Senate Republicans, joining with liberal Democrats, to fundamental changes in the current system.  Nearly everyone agrees that the welfare system has been a disaster.  
	<P>It has been particularly devastating for black communities throughout the U.S.  As late as 1958, 78 percent of black children were living with two-parent families.  That figure is now at 45 percent--and falling.  But the reverberations of the disastrous welfare system can be felt throughout virtually every segment of society.
	<P>The two most important aspects of welfare reform--denying additional benefits to women who have more children while on the welfare rolls and denying cash benefits to teen-agers who have children out of wedlock--should have been easy to implement.  Any idiot can see that if you pay women to have children without marrying and you set up house for teen-agers who have already shown that they are irresponsible and pay them to continue to make the same mistakes, you'll end up with what we've got right now.  After all, do women who are married and work receive a raise every time they have a baby?  And, if people are paid to have babies, why is anyone surprised when they do?<P>
	<P>But the battle was actually lost in the spring when the debate on welfare shifted from making parents responsible for their children to punishing children for their parents' mistakes.  Once the liberals took the latter argument and ran with it, moderates caved.  Although versions of those elements remain in the version passed March 24 by the House, which has generally been far more conservative in its approach to welfare, senior administration officials have made clear that the President would veto the House measure.
<P>	The Senate bill seeks to save $70 billion in welfare spending over seven years and, by the year 2000, would require that 50 percent of parents receiving welfare work for their benefits.  It would also impose a five-year limit on drawing welfare benefits, although states could offer hardship exemptions to a limited pool of recipients.  
	<P>These are good first steps, but they miss the point.  Welfare should not be an entitlement, but a contract between the recipient and his or her country that, in exchange for assistance during hard times, he or she will do the following: 1) Work and/or attend school; 2) Change irresponsible behavior; 3) Vow to make better decisions in the future.
	<P>The President and others will, however, claim victory for reforming the welfare system.  The Republicans have extolled the concept of block granting the welfare payments to the states in the form of lump sums.  This will allow the states more flexibility to see what works and what doesn't.  
	<P>But, politicians have a tendency, when given lump sum payments, to transfer those sums to areas where the politically powerful have exerted pressure.  And, with a lack of vision as to the principles upon which we would like our national welfare system administered, we'll end up with 50 different hybrids.
	<P>Five years from now, we'll look back on this period and say, "We should have done something in 1995.  The problem has gotten worse."

   In a speech some hailed as courageous and others said was classic Clinton, the President said July 19 that race
and gender preferences are fair, and have lived up to their purpose of removing obstacles blocking opportunities for
minorities and women. He issued a directive to federal departments and a 100-page report advocating reforms to
ensure that programs benefit those who need help the most.<p>
     The President ordered the elimination or overhaul of any program that "creates a quota, creates preferences
for unqualified individuals, creates reverse discrimination or continues even after its equal opportunity purposes
have been achieved."<P>
     Clinton also called for a new federal set-aside program to target federal contracts to businesses in poor
areas even if they are owned by whites.  Currently, set-asides are reserved for women and minorities.<P>
     The president's remarks cheered leaders of women's groups and minorities, who are an instrumental part
of his political base.  Myrlie Evers-Williams, head of the NAACP, praised Clinton for "his bold, decisive
statement."<P>
     But Rep. Gary Franks, a black Republican from Connecticut, said Clinton's proposals could only add to
"the stigma of any person of color" who must repeatedly proved his or her qualifications. Franks sought,
unsuccessfully, to attach an amendment to a defense spending bill that would wipe out race-and gender-based
preferences for future federal contracts.  The House delayed consideration of the FY96 defense appropriations
measure until after the August recess and, thus, scuttled Franks' amendment in the process.<P>
     In sharp attack at the House leadership, Franks said House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) And others
indicated they supported his proposal and would back his effort to attach the measure to the defense spending bill. 
Instead, the Rules Committee did not even vote on whether to grant Franks a waiver.  It approved by unanimous
voice vote a rule government floor debate under which Franks' proposal could be easily killed.<P>
     "I was lied to for seven weeks," Franks said in a telephone interview with the Associated Press, adding that
it left "a bitter taste in [his] mouth."  According to Franks, House leaders lost their nerve after members of the
Congressional Black Caucus threatened to use parliamentary tactics to tie up the House to block the Franks
amendment.<P>
     Gingrich has been criticized within his party recently for saying the GOP should go a bit slower on the
affirmative action front until the party has a positive agenda to promote to potential black voters.  The House
Speaker is wise in this regard and is on the right track, despite what some conservatives say.<P>  
     Since the party does not have a record of defending civil rights in the recent past, it lacks the moral
authority at this time to simply do away with those measures which have offered some protections to minorities and
women.  The GOP must present an alternative approach.  Simply saying society should now be color-blind, when it
is clearly not, is either naive or cynical.<P>
     Along with Gingrich, presidential candidate Lamar Alexander has perhaps made the most sensible
suggestion regarding the GOP's approach to affirmative action.  "We need to be talking about equal opportunity,"
he said on CNN's "Inside Politics" program on Aug. 2.  "When we talk about racial preferences, we need to also say
we're against racial discrimination.  We have to be very careful concerning this issue," he added.<P>
     Alexander is right.  Affirmative action is a delicate, emotionally charged issue and all politicians would do
well to handle it in a thoughtful manner.<p>

   The Democratic Party has targeted two Congressional seats currently held by black Republicans for defeat in
1996.  Republican Rep. Gary Franks of Connecticut and Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma were both listed in a directive
called "Majority  96," in which the Democrats indicated the seats by state they'd like to regain in order to have a
majority in the U.S. House and Senate.<P>
     The directive says Franks "won with only 52% of the vote in 1994.  Bush won the district, but it can be
easily claimed by the Democrats in 1996."<P>
     Regarding Watts, the edict described him as the freshman who "won seat vacated by Dave McCurdy with a
low 51% of the vote" (actually, Watts received 52%).  "This charismatic quarterback led the Oklahoma University
Sooners in the early  80s and won over his Democratic district in 1994," the document continued.  "While
consistently a Democratic area, the district nevertheless favored Bush by 9 points in 1992."<P>
     Other districts targeted included the 9th District of Texas, currently represented by Steve Stockman; the
22nd District of California, represented by freshman Andrea Seastrand who narrowly won Michael Huffington's
open seat with 49% of the vote; and the 1st District of Idaho, represented by Helen Chenoweth.<p>

<a name="memo"></a><hr>
<a href="#quick">(Back to QuickLinks)</a><p>
Democrats often accuse Republicans of playing the race card, but an internal memo sent to President Clinton
from his pollster, Stanley Greenberg, demonstrates that while Democrats claim to be "color-blind" in public, they
play racial politics behind the scenes.<P>
     The memo, dated July 5, 1995, is addressed to the Clintons and Gores, White House Chief of Staff Leon
Panetta, Deputy Chiefs of Staff Harold Ickes and Erskine Bowles, and the President's Senior Advisor George
Stephanopoulos.  The contents were revealed in a CNN "Inside Politics" broadcast in August.<P>
     "The President is fundamentally mispositioned for 1996, and. . .white downscale voters question whether
Mr. Clinton's initiatives matter to them and whether he understands and identifies with their lives and daily
struggles," said Greenberg's memo.  The memo cites specific groups the President needs to win over or win back
next year: White working class women, union members, older working class men and rural Latinos."<p>

   A principal operative for the Alan Keyes presidential campaign has resigned and signed on with Pat Buchanan's
campaign team.<P>
     Arthur Rocker, former finance director for candidate Keyes, agreed to join Buchanan as a national co-chairman, he said in an interview.  Rocker officially accepted the position Aug. 8.<P>
     Rocker recruited Keyes to run for president last fall and played a major role in the formation of the
exploratory committee.  After helping Keyes raise more than $300,000 during the first six months of the year,
Rocker left the campaign, saying, "I'm disgusted with his [Keyes'] organizational skills and question his leadership
ability."<P>
     For its part, the Keyes campaign said Rocker had been the source of "still-unresolved discrepancies in the
finances" of the exploratory committee.  However, the Keyes organization is the only one among the Republican
presidential candidates which has failed to file a Federal Elections Commission financial disclosure report or
requested an extension.  Keyes says he was "too busy to do it," according to a Baltimore Sun report.<P>
     The fundraising specialist said that, as a Buchanan operative, he would do whatever was asked of him.  "I
admire Buchanan's commitment to conservative values.  He's been consistent in his positions over the years," said
Rocker.<p>

   House Speaker Newt Gingrich dropped into unfamiliar surroundings the evening of Aug. 2 as he listened for
more than an hour to residents of Washington asking--and sometimes begging--him to help their city out of its
morass of problems.<P>
     Billed as a discussion in town-meeting style, as part of the House Republicans' effort to find solutions to
decades of urban ills, it quickly became something much more.  Nearly 1,000 people attended the forum and
hundreds more were unable to get into the packed high school auditorium.  This meeting was the first of several the
speaker has planned to address the city's budget crisis and deteriorating public schools.<P>
     But this may have been part of the problem.  There was an obvious mood filled with unrealistic
expectations as audience participants asked the speaker questions as varied as how to get parents more involved
with their children's educational process to how to get rid of the current school superintendent.<P>
     Gingrich was booed when introduced, but the questioners were, for the most part, respectful.<P>
     Sharing the stage with top local Democrats--Mayor Marion Barry and congressional delegate Eleanor
Holmes Norton, plus Jesse Jackson--Gingrich acknowledged the improbable grouping.<P>
     He joked that months ago, the odds that he and Barry would be on the same platform and working together
were "probably as good as some folks would have given against my being speaker or (Barry) being mayor again."<P>
     Both Barry and Jackson sat in silence as Gingrich spoke.<P>
     Even though the previous Speaker, Thomas S. Foley, a Democrat, lived on Capitol Hill during his final
years in office, he never engaged city residents in the style that Gingrich did.  The gathering is supposed to be the
first such session for Gingrich, who has said he will attend them.<P>
     "Tonight is a beginning," Gingrich told a woman who asked about the quality of Washington's public
schools now and in the future.  "I can't assure you that as a group we'll make a big difference.  I can't give you a
date or even guarantee that it will happen.  But we will reach out and do everything we can to improve resources
and safety to have a healthy Washington."<P>
     Barry, the popular four-term mayor who managed a comeback after leaving office in disgrace because of a
cocaine conviction, said he and Gingrich were putting political differences aside to collaborate on making
Washington "the finest capital anywhere in the world."<P>
     Team play was the evening's official theme and Norton warmly credited Gingrich with garnering some
$200 million in federal highway funds for city road repairs.  Norton, who has tried hard to insure that city residents
are not excluded from the exchange of ideas for saving their city, was largely responsible for the speaker's
appearance.<P>
     In the face of periodic insults, Gingrich stood at the lectern taking copious notes, nodding in agreement and
responding only occasionally to questions asked.  He won applause when he promised residents "significant" tax
relief and world-class schools.<P>
     "We do not have the right to micromanage the lives of the people who live in this city," he assured the
attendees.  Congress earlier this year established a federal board to control the city's finances.<P>
     In August, the speaker's task force on the D.C. economy recommended a federal income tax credit and
other tax breaks--totaling between $1.3 billion and $2.7 billion--to attract and keep residents and businesses in the
city.<P>
     Gingrich and Wisconsin Rep. Steve Gunderson also unveiled a plan to raise private-sector funds for
equipment, maintenance and repairs in the public schools, which opened nearly a week late last September because
of thousands of fire code violations.<P>
     A second fund-raising drive would establish a scholarship fund for low-income families who would prefer
to send their children to private schools, said Gunderson, leader of the House Republicans' task force on D.C.
schools.<P>
     Later that day, at a brief news conference, he pronounced the meeting a success.
     "What surprised me the most, and pleased me the most," he said, "was the calm intensity" of people in the
audience.  "Here were people who were frustrated, who felt Congress had dealt with them unfairly in the past.  But
they were back one more time."<P>

<UL>
<LI>$500 per child tax credit.  This tax credit allows parents
to subtract $500 off their tax bill for each child under 18 years
of age.  
<LI>Cut capital gains tax rate from 28% to 14%.  In 1992, 56%
of capital gains were from households with incomes of $50,000
or less.  Households with less than $100,000 income accounted
for 83% of the returns reporting capital gains.
<LI>Repeal the 1993 tax hike on Social Security benefits.  Due
to the 1993 Clinton tax increase on Social Security, 85% of Social
Security benefits became subject to federal taxation.  Retiree
incomes as low as $34,000 saw their taxes on Social Security benefits
rise.
<LI>American Dream Savings Accounts.  These accounts would expand
IRA's.  They would allow after-tax contributions and earn interest tax-free.
 They would also allow penalty-free withdrawals to help finance a first home, pay for
college expenses, or defray medical costs.  
<LI>IRA's for spouses who choose to stay at home.  A $2,000 per
year contribution can be 
put into an IRA on behalf of a spouse who works at home.
<LI>Education Investment Accounts.  These accounts allow up to
$500 per child per year to be put into tax-free account.  Parents who placed $500 per
year into the account would accrue $18,689 tax-free after 18 years.

<LI>America is experiencing the slowest expansion in 100 years.
 The Clinton expansion is averaging 2.4% growth - not exactly
the best economy in the last 30 years.  The last five expansions
produced average growth rates of 4.4%.  The Reagan expansion during
the 1980's averaged over 5% growth.
<LI>Tax Freedom Day is now the latest ever.  The day Americans
work until to pay their share of federal taxes is now May 7, the
latest it's ever been.
<LI>Cost of Government day now July 3.  In 1996 Americans worked
until July 3 to earn enough money to pay off all direct and
hidden taxes (total federal, state, local government spending
plus the cost of regulation).
<LI>Real Median Household Income lower during Clinton than the
previous decade.  From 1983 to 1992, real median household income
was $33,119.  Under Clinton, it shrunk to $32,153.
<LI>Federal, State, and Local taxes account for 38% of a family's
budget (more than food, clothing, and health care combined). 
Today 26% of a family's budget goes to federal taxes, 12% to state
and local taxes, while 9% goes to food, 4% is spent on clothing,
and 10% goes for medical care.
<LI>Worker's real hourly wages have gone down under Clinton.  Bill
Clinton, the alleged protector of the working man, has presided
over a .4% drop in real hourly wages.  Wages went up 5.6% during
the decade before Clinton.  <BR>

<CENTER><B>How to Balance the Budget with the Dole Tax Cut</B></CENTER>
<P>
The economic plan of Republican Presidential nominee Robert
Dole promises to enact a major tax reduction plan and to balance
the Federal budget by 2002.  Some have argued that the lost revenue
from the tax cut plan would make balancing the budget by 2002
impossible.  The following facts show that this is untrue.
<UL>
<LI>Even counting the reduced tax revenues from the Dole tax cut
plan, the budget can be  balanced by 2002 by holding the growth
in government spending to 2.1% per year.  This is only slightly
less than the rate of increase in Federal spending since 1992,
which has been 2.4%.
<LI>Between now and 2002, the Federal government would spend $10.8
trillion overall under current law.  Counting the reduced revenue
from the Dole tax cut plan, the Federal budget can be balanced
by 2002 while still spending $10.2 trillion between now and then.
<LI>Counting the reduced revenue from the Dole tax cut plan, the
budget can be balanced by 2002 if the government spends just 4%
less than it now plans to spend between now and then.
<LI>Counting the reduced revenue from the Dole tax cut plan, the
budget can be balanced by 2002 while increasing annual Federal
spending by 14% by that year compared to this year.  Under current
law, annual Federal spending will be 20% larger by 2002 compared
to today.

	Cost of Government Day is the date of the calendar year, counting from January  1, that Americans have earned enough money to pay off the  total financial burden of government, including all state and federal spending and  regulatory costs.<P>
	The money we send to the government on April 15th is only the visible tip of a much larger iceberg.  Politicians have learned to circumvent the watchful eye of anti-tax voters by enacting hidden taxes--regulationsand government mandates.  Costly government programs, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act and family leave legislation, do not show up in the federal or state budgets.  But they do cost money.<P>
 	This year, every American taxpayer will work until July 3rd--more than half way through the  year--to pay off his or  her share of government imposed financial costs. The total cost of government in 1996 is estimated at
 $3.38 trillion. That's $13,000 for every man, woman and child in 
America. Of this total, nearly $1 trillion results from federal and
state regulation. The federal government is responsible for more than
 $739 million in hidden regulatory taxes this year alone. That's more
 than $2,800 for every man, woman and child in America.<P>

*Leap Year makes TFD, SFD, and COGD appear one day earlier
<UL>
<LI>1  Based on Tax Foundation figures
<LI>2  SFD measures the cost of total government outlays (taxes plus borrowing)
<LI>3  COGD incorporates total (federal, state, and local) government expenditures, federal regulatory costs, and state workers' compensation and tort law costs.  COGD data is based on information compiled by Americans for Tax Reform Foundation from data in the President's January 1996 budget baseline; Thomas D. Hopkins, "Costs of Regulation:  Filling the Gaps" (report prepared for the Regulatory Information Service Center, Washington, D.C.), August 1992; "Tort Cost Trends; An International Perspective" (report prepared by the Tillinghast Company), 1992; and independent data provided by the Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Economic Analysis.</UL><P>






<FONT SIZE=+1><BOLD><a name="DEFINITION">Introduction to Cost of Government Day
</a></BOLD></FONT><P>
<BOLD>Definition</BOLD><BR>
Cost of Government Day is the day of the calendar year, counting form January 1, on which the average American worker has earned enough in gross income to pay off his or her federal, state, and local government-imposed financial obligations--total spending plus the cost of regulation.<P>

<BOLD>Methodology</BOLD><BR>
The cost of government is determined by adding the figures for government spending (all federal, state, and local outlays) and an estimate of the cost of government regulations.  A 1992 report prepared for the Regulatory Information Service Center by Rochester Institute of Technology Professor Thomas D. Hopkins provided the framework for determining the cost of regulations.  His figures were updated to include the cost of new regulations from information provided by economist Dr. Robert Genetski and estimates by Cost of Government Day director Alan Philp.  State workers' compensation and tort costs were included in the COGD figure as well, from information provided in a report produced by the Tillinghast Company.

<BOLD>What COGD Does/Does Not Include:</BOLD><BR>
<UL>
<LI>  All federal, state, and local outlays (taxes plus borrowing) are included in COGD.
<LI>  Most federal regulations are incorporated.  Exceptions include costs associated with minimum wage laws and anti-trust laws.
<LI> At the state level, only workers' compensation and tort costs  are incorporated.  Costs associated with state and local environmental protection, worker safety, and consumer protection are not included.  These costs, which are not included because the measurements cannot readily be quantified and broken out, can be substantial.
<LI> Indirect costs of regulation--resources diverted from other activities (e.g., decreased time with families, less leisure time) -- are not included.  Compliance costs, paperwork costs, and transfer costs are included.</UL></p>




<BOLD>Overview of the Cost of Government</BOLD><BR>
 
<P>
 <UL>
<LI> Cost of Government Day has moved forward for three straight years due to (1)sharp cuts in defense spending, (2)the defeat of Bill Clinton's government take-over of the health care system, and (3)a lessening in the number of major new regulations.  Had the Clinton health care plan passed, Cost of Government Day would have moved back approximately 30 days.  Americans would be working for the government an additional month.
<LI>  Because the 1996 House Republican budget became law, at least in 
part , Cost of Government Day came earlier than in 1995.  By 2000, Cost of Government Day will arrive at least 11 days earlier than scheduled under the Clinton plan.
<LI>  By 2002, the GOP budget will make Cost of Government Day arrive at least 17 days earlier than scheduled under the Clinton plan.  (This figure does not include additional savings from proposed Republican regulatory and legal reforms.)
<LI>  Republican legal reforms, if passed, will help rein in soaring civil justice costs, which now consume $300 billion per year, according to Citizens for a Sound Economy.<P></ul>





<A NAME="Facts About Regulation"><bold><font size=+1>Facts About Regulation</font><br>
Quantifying the Costs<bold><p>

<bold>Regulation Costs Jobs.</bold>  Economists Michael Hazilla and Raymond J. Kopp concluded that environmental regulations alone had by 1990 reduced the overall employment level by 1.18 percent.  According to economist Bill Laffer, that translates into 1.1 million to 1.4 million fewer jobs.  Laffer estimates the cost of all federal regulations numbers between 3.6 million and 9.6 million jobs.<br>
<ADDRESS>Sources:  Michael Hazilla and Raymond J. Kopp, "Social Cost of Environmental Quality Regulations:  A General Equilibrium Analysis," Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 98, No. 4 (1990), p.869; and William G. Laffer, "How Regulation is Destroying American Jobs," The Heritage Foundation:  16 February 1993, pp.6-7.</ADDRESS><p>

<bold>The Costs of Affirmative Action:</bold><br>
A projection based on a Forbes magazine model finds that the direct compliance costs of affirmative action programs cost the nation $25 billion per year.  But indirect costs -- paperwork, loss of efficiency, etc. -- could exceed $100 billion per year, according to the study.  According to the Congressional Research Service, about 160 federal programs, statutes, regulations, and executive orders grant some measure of "preference" to women or minorities in the areas of hiring, federal contracts, educational opportunities and grants.<br>

<bold>Losses to Farmers:</bold></br>
The American Farm Bureau  Federation estimates that U.S. agricultural interests spend between $18 billion and $20 billion per year complying with federal regulations.  To put things in perspective, that figure is roughly 35 percent of total net farm income in the United States.  If this estimate is in the ballpark, farmers spend $2 complying with government-mandated regulations for every $1 they receive in price supports.<br>
<ADDRESS>Source:  Thad Cochran, "Regulatory Relief for Farmers," The Washington Times, April 4, 1995.</ADDRESS><p>

<bold>The Cost of Cleanliness:</bold><br>
According to the U.S. Commerce Department, pollution abatement and control expenditures consumed more than 18 percent of gross private domestic nonresidential investment in 1992, or $102 billion.  Over the past 20 years, U.S. businesses have been forced to divert almost 15 percent of their total fixed investment to nonproductive equipment.<br>
<ADDRESS>Source:  Bruce Bartlett, "The High Cost of Turning Green," The Wall Street Journal, September 14, 1994.</ADDRESS><p>

<bold>Automobile Prices:</bold><br>
The cost of emissions-control equipment added to a new car through the 1994 model year averages $2010, according to data supplied by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and corrected to 1993 dollars.  Californians face a major dilemma in the coming years.  Regulators there have issued quotas of zero-emissions cars that they must build and sell, starting with 2 percent of the vehicles sold in California in 1998, then rising to five percent in 2001, and to 10 percent in 2003 and beyond.  This regulation promises almost no discernible benefits.  Every new car sold in the state today is 97% clean.  Most smog is produced by the dirtiest 10% of cars.  The 100 percent clean cars will replace the 97 percent clean cars, not the worst polluters.<br>

<bold>The Price Tag:</bold><br>
Government regulators regularly under-estimate the true cost of their proposed regulations.  The <ADDRESS>Federal Register</ADDRESS>  estimated that obtaining a stormwater discharge permit under the Clean Water Act would cost $76,681.  Gregory S. Lashutka, mayor of Columbus, Ohio, reports that his city's actual cost was $1.5 million.<br>

Smoking Regulations:</bold><br>
In what is estimated will cost $8.1 billion in the first year alone, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has marching order to go out and require restaurants, retailers, office buildings owners, and others to inspect and maintain their indoor ventilation systems and ban cigarette smoking unless it takes place in separately ventillated rooms.  Government regulators have launched a crusade to stamp out smoking, based on "studies" showing secondhand smoke to be a health menace.  But the 1.19 risk ration for intensive, 40 year, day-in-day-out, pack-a-day exposure to secondhand smoke is by virtually all measures insignificant.<br><ADDRESS>Source:  Susan Eckerly, "Seeking a Regulatory Respite," The Washington Times, February 12, 1995; and Jerry Taylor, "Cancer Risks for Thee, but Not for Me," The Wall Street Journal, January 3, 1995.</ADDRESS><p>

<bold>Water Quality Standards:</bold><br>
In March, the EPA's Great Lakes Initiative imposed uniform standards for water quality on eight different states (Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin).  A study conducted for the Council of Great Lakes Governors says this will cost more than $2 billion per year and destroy up to 33,000 jobs.<br>
<ADDRESS>Source:  Susan Eckerly, "Seeking a Regulatory Respite," The Washington Times, February 12, 1995.</ADDRESS><p>

<bold>Air Pollution Standards:</bold><br>
Californians face $4 to $6 billion more to federal air quality regulatory costs each year.  Environmental Protection Agency regulators are marching into Los Angeles, Sacramento, and Ventura to enforce compliance with the 1977 Clean Air Act.  The state of California estimates that by 2010, "losses will total at least $8.4 billion in direct costs, $17.2 billion in output, and 165,000 jobs."<br>

<bold>Ethanol:</bold><br>
Bill Clinton frequently chooses to use regulatory dictates to reward favorite industries and constituencies.  Bowing to the powerful corn lobby, Clinton last year adopted the so-called ethanol rule, guaranteeing ethanol a 30 percent share of the oxygenate market for the reformulated gasoline program.  Ethanol is typically more expensive than its alternative, an ether known as MTBE.  Clinton's ethanol mandate was on track to cost consumers as much as $350 million per year at the gasoline pump (on top of his gas tax) and would have deprived the National Highway Trust Fund of millions of dollars of revenues because ethanol is partially tax exempt.  In April, 1995, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals delivered Clinton at least a temporary setback, ruling Clinton exceeded his authority with the ethanol mandate.<br>

<bold>The ADA's Legal Quagmire:</bold><br>
By December, 1994, nearly 40,000 complaints were filed under the Americans with Disabilities Act.  But mounting evidence suggests massive abuse.  Eighty-five percent of complaints came from people who had jobs, one-fifth of complaints came from people with back trouble, and nearly 12 percent from those with emotional or psychiatric impairments.  These figures suggest a large amount of administrative and legal activity for an apparently modest return, considering that Congress intended to design an incentive-based approach to broadening opportunities for the disabled.<br><ADDRESS>Source:  Claudia Winkler, "Reality Check on ADA's Results," The Washington Times, April 20, 1995.</ADDRESS><p>
<bold>FDA Tyranny:</bold><br>The Food and Drug Administration will soon require food manufacturers to notify the FDA before marketing foods manufactured with new biotech techniques -- high precision recombinant DNA, or gene splicing techniques.

In Sacramento, California, residents are reeling over a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ruling last fall which added three varieties of the fairy shrimp to th endangered species list.  The agency relied upon a one-paragraph petition submitted by a Davis, Calif., botanist in 1990, even though millions of the hardy shrimp can be found in California, Europe, Asia, Australia and Africa.  The decision has shut down a pony ranch that housed a Sacramento program for needy and disabled children and could cost the Sacramento-area housing industry $550 million.<br>

Pushing forward with the next stage of the 1990 Clean Air Act, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has created a new paperwork nightmare for companies in high smog urban areas called the Employee Commute Option (ECO).  Employers in these regions are forced to find ways to cajole a designated percentage of their workers into carpools -- or face devastating financial penalties that can reach as high as $25,000 per violation.  Eric Peters, an automotive writer for <ADDRESS>The Washington Times</ADDRESS> observes that "the real genius of the ECO mandate is that it turns employers -- not the government or the EPA -- into the bullyboy."

The EPA also announced new emissions standards for marine engines, one of the last unregulated emissions sources.  Since marine engines are responsible for only about three percent of total emissions, the new standards are unlikely to have any noticeable effect on air quality.  But consumers will notice.  The high-performance, fuel-injected marine engines necessary to comply with the mandate can cost $1,200 (15%) more than conventional engines, a nationwide cost of as much as $300 million per year.<br>

Food and Drug Administration rules implemented by FDA head David Kessler are costing lives.  In 1991, Dr. Kessler prohibited pharmaceutical companies from informing doctors of new uses for approved drugs.  In one instance, the FDA stopped a pharmaceutical company from distributing free copies of "The Chemotherapy Source Book"--even though the company had already received FDA approval to give away thousands of copies.  The FDA claims that when a drug company gives doctors free textbooks that mention an off-label use of its products, the drugs become subject to seizure.<br><ADDRESS>Source:  James Bovard, "First Step to an FDA Cure:  Dump Kessler,"  The Wall Street Journal, December 8, 1994.</ADDRESS><p>

Bob Floyd of Muncie, Ind., had a "wetland" mysteriously appear on his property when a local business accidentally cut a drainage pipe.  Federal regulators swooped in to protect this "wetland" and forced the 80-year-old farmer to stop farming.  The so-called wetland has since dried up, but Mr. Floyd may have to sell the land his family has farmed for a half century.

Bob Lindberg, president of Young Co. in Seattle, thought his small metal firm had a decent diversity record -- with a work force that included about 35 percent women and minorities -- until the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) came knocking on his door.  The agency accused the firm, which is a subcontractor for a company that supplies anchors to the Navy, of a number of charges including failing to hire qualified Asian applicants.  Young opened his books to the auditors, spent thousands of dollars on a consultant, and finally settled in part by paying $47,000 in back wages to some minority workers.<br>

John Thorpe's plans to build on his own property were thwarted by the Fish and Wildlife Service, which demanded to know what steps he had taken to preserve the salt marsh harvest mouse.  Though Mr. Thorpe only wanted to develop mostly on the dry, upland portion of his propery, an agency of the U.S. government theorized that when golboal warming melts the polar ice-caps, the Pacific will rise and inundate the habitat of the salt marsh harvest mouse on his lowlands, forcing it to seek refuge on Thorpe's highlands.  For this science fiction story, Thorpe was denied permission to develope his land.<br>

Richard Enthoven's family-owned Kwik Wash Laundries Inc. in Dallas says it is facing damage claims totaling more than $2 million in two suits.  In a high-crime neighborhood in San Antonio three years ago, a man was murdered near the entrance of one apartment building launderette, where he was washing a friend's clothes at about 2 a.m.  E.B. Barretto, the attorney representing the victim's father, alleges that Kwik Wash failed to provide adequate security at its launderette.  He further claims a security light was out and Kwik Wash violated the apartment building's safety guidelines, which called for closing the launderette at 10 p.m.<br>

In an example of the lawsuit frenzy borne of the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act, in July, 1992, GTE Data Services in Tampa discovered that one of its computer programmers had been stealing money from other employees and had brought a loaded derringer to work.  When he was fired for having the gun, he sued for reinstatement under the ADA.  He said he was the victim of a mental illness aggravated by improper medication , and thus disabled under the language of the act.  The first court ruling - later overturned -- went in the programmer's favor:  "When poor judgment is a sympton of a mental or psychological disorder, it is defined as an impairment that would qualify as a disability under the ADA," the court said.

David and Florence Isbell -- well known in activist legal circles in Washington -- teamed up with the Washington Lawyers' Committee to force Washington area theaters to install special assistive listening devices.  Cineplex theaters, the unfortunate target of the Isbell's crusade, had been installing the equipment in theaters around the nation when the Isbell's filed suit.  In response, Cineplex accelerated the installation plan for the Washington area and had all theaters equipped by August 31.  Thinking the problem had been solved, Cineplex asked the U.S. District court to dismiss the suit.  The lead attorney for the Washington Lawyers' Committee refused to back down.  Cineplex ageed to pay $60,000 in attorneys' fees and accept the supervision of a court appointed monitor.  Howard Lichtman, executive vice president of the Cineplex chain, says the rate of requests for the devices "is infinitesimal."

The Republican Congress should set specific goals for the movement of Cost of Government Day.  Specifically, legislators should target a Cost of Government Day 1996 on or before July 4th, so that Americans can truly enjoy their liberation from the government on Independence Day.  Likewise, Congress should aim for a Cost of Government Day 2005 on or before April 15th so Americans can truly enjoy the fruits of the labor by the time they file their taxes.<p>

Heighten public attention about "bureaucratic tyranny" by establishing a monthly "Corrections Day" and holding public "show trials" of wasteful government programs and abusive regulations.  "Corrections Day," as dubbed by Speaker Gingrich, would help stem "self-evidently stupid," "profoundly dumb," "stupidly legal" and "silly" regulations flowing from federal agencies.
<address><br>Source:  Kenneth Cooper, "Speaker is planning a Bash for Bureaucratic Boondoggles, "The Washington Post, May 3, 1995.</address><p>

Bar unelected federal bureaucrats from making laws.  Ultimately, no law should go into effect without the consent of a majority of the House, a majority of the Senate, and the signature of the President.  Lawmakers should take direct responsibility for laws by enacting them themselves.  Agency bureaucrats can make recommendations, conduct risk assessment, and propose legal language, but should not be allowed to make laws themselves.<br>

Reduce the number of government regulators.  From 1985 to 1992, staffing of federal regulatory agencies increased by over 20 percent.  By 1992, the federal government employed almost 125,000 regulatory employees, and that total has increased under Bill Clinton.  One way Congress can reduce "bureaucratic tyranny," as Speaker Gingrich has described it, is by reducing the number of government regulators.  Too often, regulators seek to justify their own existence by implementing time consuming and overly bureaucratic mandates on state and local governments and private businesses. <p> Congress should send regulators a message:  Overzealous regulatory behavior will be punished, not rewarded.  State and local governments must follow suit.  During the 1980's, state-level bureaucracies increased by almost 20 percent.  Whereas the federal government employes about two million civilian employees, state and local governments employ more than six times that amount.<br>
<address>Source:  Jonathan Adler, "On a High Regulatory Roll,"  The Washington Times, April 4, 1994.</address><p> 

Demand proper risk assessment of all proposed regulations.  Government regulators are notorious for devoting huge resources to relatively insignificant risks -- like asbestos exposure in schools -- at tremendous cost to companies and consumers.  For example, look at EPA's risk assessment for a Superfund site.  You will learn about hypothetical children who eat dirt 250 days a year from the bottom of contaminated brooks and ponds.  Likewise, the Safe Drinking Water Act mandates that local governments get rid of virtually all chloroform in their water, even though the best available science suggests that chloroform does not pose a danger in the biological mechanisms associated with drinking tap water.  Risk assessment should quantify the cost of all proposed regulations and rank risks in order of priority.  Target risks should be compared to several ordinary risks that people confront in their daily lives.  In addition, regulators should be required to consider competing risks -- dangers induced by regulators.  For example, Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards requiring "fuel efficient" automobiles are resulting in smaller, less safe cars and more deaths and injuries on the road.<br>

Enact a federal regulatory budget.  Such a budget would establish a maximum total regulatory burden that government could impose on the economy.  Any new regulations that would exceed the budget based on risk assessment reports would require the repeal or modification of some other regulations to ensure regulatory burden neutrality.<br>

Overhaul the Clean Air Act and allow states to use remote-sensing detectors to identify high-emission vehicles.  Just 10 percent of the cars on the road produce half of all hydrocarbons.  But current law subjects the 90 percent of clean auto owners to cumbersome, expensive, time-consuming, bureaucracy-intensive mandates such as inspections, reformulated gasolines, car-pooling requirements, alternative fuels, and even soon-to-be mandated production of inefficient electric cars in California.  Remote-sensing technology can identify dirt cars, reducing the role of government and freeing most auto-owners from bureaucratic harassment.<br>

Reform the 1974 Clean Water Act to specifically and reasonably define what constitutes a wetland.  Under current rules, federal regulators have construed the Clean Water Act to classify huge tracts of land as wetlands for protection from development, even though the 1974 statute says nothing about welands protection.  Bipartisan legislation sponsored by Rep. Bud Shuster calling on the Army Corps of Engineers and the Department of Agriculture to classify all existing welands based on function and environmental importance into categoies A (high priority), B (modest priority) and C (low priority)  would put an end to egregious bureaucratic regulatory "takings" from private land-owners.<br>

Repeal the Delaney Clause, a provision of the 1958 Food Drug and Cosmetic Act that allows only additives deemed to have zero risk of causing cancer to be used on processed foods.  Passed at a time when cancer risks were far more difficult to determine, the statute is grossly outdated at best and an example of hyper-regulatory overkill at worst.<br>

Enact Long-awaited Banking Reform.  Existing banking laws -- largely incorporated in the 1930's-era Glass-Seagall Act -- are woefully outdated, sharply restricting or prohibiting the ability of banks to expand across state lines, sell insurance, or provide investment underwriting.  As a result, American banks are at a tremendous disadvantage in the world market.  Congress should repeal antiquated laws such as the Glass-Seagall Act and promote competition in the American banking industry.  A recent McKinsey & Co. study found that the annual costs of interstate banking under today's cumbersome regulatory structure can range from .5 percent to almost one percent of a company's noninterest expenses -- a total in the billions of dollars.  And these savings are dwarfed by those that will come from the nationwide consolidations of operations.

Repeal market regulations on telecommunications providers.  The long distance and local telephone markets, as well as the cable television market, should be opened up to competition.  Current law, based on the 1934 Communications Act based on 19th century railroad regulation, imposes restrictions which ensure virtual monopolies in existing phone and cable markets.  These antiquated regulations should come to an end, and the cable-telco ban, which prevents telephone and cable firms from competing against each other, should be repealed.  Competition between long distance and local phone companies and cable television providers will reduce prices and ensure better service for consumers.  The 1992 Cable Act should be repealed.

Enact Civil Justice Refomr.  The more than 70,000 product liability lawsuits filed in the United States each year cost Americans $300 billion per year, according to Citizens for a Sound Economy.  It's no wonder 47 percent of U.S. firms in a recent survey said they had withdrawn products from the market over fear of lawsuits.  Congress must pass comprehensive legal reform, including partial institution of a "loser-pays" rule to encourage settlements, a cap on "pain-and-suffering" awards in all civil suits, higher standards of proof for punitive damages in all civil suits, and limits on the liability of manufacturers.<br>

States around the country have been forced to reform their budgeting and tax policies due to their deficit spending.  Many states have been successful in trimming their deficits without raising taxes.  The method used by the most successful states has been supermajority tax limitation laws and spending limitation laws. <b>One third of all Americans live in a state withe supermajority constitutional tax limitations.  In most of the states supermajority requirements, the idea of requiring a greater than fifty percent vote of the legislature to increase taxes grew out of the tax revolt movement and the initiative process.</b>  These states offer a successful model for the Federal Government's budget and tax reform efforts.  The following states have supermajority tax limitation requirements:

<p>

From the early days of the Republic to the present, supermajority voting requirements have been part of the U.S. Constitution. Supermajority requirements are found in the following sections of the Constitution:
<p>



<TABLE BORDER>

<TH>Article                        </th>

<th>Applies To:                  </th><tr>

<td>Article 1, section 3, clause 6</td>

<td>Conviction in impeachment trials</td><tr>

<td>Article 1, section 5, clause 2</td>

<td>Expulsion of a Member of Congress</td><tr>

<td>Article I, section 7, clause 2</td>	

<td>Override a presidential veto</td><tr>

<td>Article II, section 1, clause 3</td>	<td>Quorum of two-thirds of the states to elect the President</td><tr>

<td>Article II, section 2, clause 2</td>	<td>Consent to a treaty</td><tr>

<td>Article V</td>	<td>Proposing constitutional amendments</td><tr>

<td>Article VII</td>	<td>State ratification of the original Constitution</td><tr>

<td>Amendment XII</td>	<td>Quorum of two-thirds of the states to elect the President and the Vice President.</td><tr>

<td>Amendment XIV</td>	<td>To remove disability of those who have engaged in insurrection</td><tr>

<td>Amendment XXV section 4</td>	<td>Presidential disability</td><tr>





</table></body></html>

<P><P>
	
The Framers' decision not to impose additional constitutional supermajority requirements does not mean that they opposed extending the concept. It simply means that at the time of ratification they did not see a need for other supermajority requirements. However, they did recognize that circumstances change and that the Constitution would need to be flexible to change with the passage of time. Consequently, they provided a mechanism to amend the Constitutionan amendment mechanism that itself requires two supermajority voting requirements: Congressional adoption of the proposed amendment by a 2/3 supermajority and then approval by three-fourths of the states for ratification.
<p>
	Finally, a supermajority requirement for increasing the U.S. tax burden is not unprecedented. The 16th Amendment to the Constitution, which provides for the income tax, had to be approved by a vote of two-thirds of Congress and three-fourths of the states. It is only logical that we should extend this protection to increases of the tax burden that are far in excess of the small burden first imposed in 1913.airness Restoration Act" introduced by Texas Congressman and House Majority Leader Dick Armey.  Most people call it "the flat tax" for short.<P>

<P>

<DD>Candidates and elected officials began taking the pledge in 1986. After President Reagan's Tax Reform Act of 1986 was passed,
many taxpayers feared that some politicians would raise income tax rates. With President Reagan's support and endorsement,
Americans for Tax Reform and a broad-based coalition of groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National
Federation of Independent Businesses and hundreds of taxpayer groups throughout the nation began to ask all candidates for
public office to "take the pledge." Every year, all Members of Congress are asked to take the pledge by Americans for Tax
Reform, and all challengers are asked to take the pledge during each election cycle.
