Universities.  The meeting was attended by representatives of open universities from the 
following 7 countries: India, Indonesia, South Korea, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Japan, and Thailand. 
 At this meeting, STOU was selected as the location of the Office of the Secretariat, designating 
Prof Dr Iam Chaya-Ngam as the first President of AAOU.  The current President of AAOU is Prof 
Ram G Takwale of Indira Ghandhi National Open University, India.  The AAOU Office of the 
Secretariat has recently moved to Indira Ghandhi National Open University.

education system</a>,  which relies heavily on one-way communication.  Therefore,  the course

research and quality testing of the distance educational materials must ensure a high quality of 
instructional materials which is necessary for independent learning in order to provide knowledge

<H1>Landsat Thematic Mapper Image of Twente Area</H1>

<img src="/images/e500.gif">
<h6>&#169; EOSAT 1992</h6>
<p>
The image above was taken by the Landsat satellite at 24 May 1992.
It is a false color composite image of the spectral bands 4, 5 and 3
in red, green and blue.
<br>
The image was resampled to 60 meter pixels, which is half of the
original resolution. The image covers an area of 30 by 30 kilometer.
<p>
Clearly visible are the three cities of Enschede (SE), Hengelo (W) and Oldenzaal (N)
forming a triangle in the middle of the image. Right in the middle of the
triangle lies the airport Twente.
<br>
The Twente Canal ends in Enschede in a forked shape.
<br>
The highway A1, still under construction then, runs NE of Hengelo just below
Oldenzaal, cutting the beautiful countryside like a twisting snake leaving
a bright blue trail.
<p>
Notice the difference in land use just across the German border in the upper
right corner of the image.
<p>
Other features are
<ul>
<li>Bright orange are agricultural fields with crops
<li>Dark orange are forests
<li>Cyan is bare soil
<li>Black are water bodies
<li>Bright blue is sand (see the A1)
<li>Dark blue are urban areas
</ul>

<h3>Short info</h3>
<hr>

The earth's natural
resources should be developed in such a way that they provide human kind
with a good living on a sustainable basis. Knowledge is peded to explore
and utilize these resources in a sound manner. At the ITC, this
knowledge is amply available. By means of education, research and
consulting we contribute to the strengthening of institutions in the
developing world. More than 11,500 students from over <A
HREF="/new/worldmap/worldmap.html">150 countries </A>have already
led the way. World wide and innovation are key words in our institute.
We observe the earth, generate spatial information and develop
methodologies to integrate this with other information to provide tools
for sustainable development and alleviation of poverty in developing
countries.

<h2>Comment on the oblique aerial photos</h2>

The oblique photos were made with a 35 mm camera (image format
24 x 36 mm, lens 50 mm or 28 - 105 mm zoom, Canon A1 or
Minolta 7xi camera) from a Cessna 172 airplane.
Most pictures were taken from a flying height of about 400 m
(1300 ft).
<p>
Oblique aerial photography exercises are a standard activity in the
<a href="/new/ITC_organization/larus/ush23.html">ITC USH.3 courses</a> since 1978.
<p>
The oblique photos (slides or negatives) were scanned and stored on
a Kodak Photo CD ROM in a resolution of 3072 x 2048 pixels,
3 byte color depth (16.6 M colors).
<p>
The images were converted to the GIF format with 256 colors
(1 byte color depth) and the most interesting area was extracted.
<p>
The selected areas are presented in an in-line format of 150 x ...
pixels and a view version of 600 x ... pixels. The view version is
annotated with the date of photography.

     RACE does pioneering work in a young field that hopes to reverse 
     the tragedy of modern technology: the continuous subdivision and 
     narrowing of science and the consequent loss of balance of society 
     and the environment. 
     Its activities were initiated in 1992 by Hiroyuki Yoshikawa, 
     the President of the University
     of Tokyo, who proposed novel directions for the study of engineering and
     technology related to all aspects of man-made objects "artifacts".
     Our server provides various information of RACE concepts and activities.
     It also provides links to various W3 servers installed on the campus.

Ce serveur contient des informations  propos du projet COO 
et de son implantation base sur P-RooT et des outils
qui y sont utiliss : Emeraude/PCTE, TCL, CVS

Coo is a research project which aims at building an active framework for software
development processes support. It particularly focus on coordination and consistent
support to cooperation between the different tasks and activities involved in the
process. 

Coo is mainly based on a formally defined cooperative transaction model that uses
software process models to surpass the limits of traditional transaction models, so as
to allow cooperation between the sofware developers while ensuring the consistence
of the development. 

The implementation of Coo is based on P-RooT, a software engineering database
prototype. P-RooT is an object oriented extension of PCTE that allow procedural
attachment to PCTE objects and thus provide an object-oriented interface to PCTE
object bases.

<DD>One of the major challenges confronting us today is the
  development  of  a stable information infrastructure,  an
  international  information superhighway  to  ensure  that
  information  can be transmitted quickly and  reliably  in
  whatever  formats  are  required.  The  Bangemann  report
  emphasised the crucial role that the Internet  will  play
  in  the new information society. DGXIII/E has decided  to
  harness the power of this global network of  networks  to
  assist  in  its mission to optimise information awareness
  and  promote   the  use and exploitation  of  information
  products.

<h2>POSTGRADUATE DIPLOMA AND MSC DEGREE COURSES  USH.2/3</h2>

<h1>URBAN SURVEY AND HUMAN SETTLEMENT ANALYSIS 1995</h1>

Countries in the developing world are faced with the process of continuing and rapid
urbanization.
New urban management techniques are needed to satisfy the increasing demand for urban
data and to improve and speed-up data collection, processing and analysis.
<p>
Urban planners, researchers and managers demand up-to-date information concerning
urban land use, urban expansion, squatter settlements, population estimates, processes of
change, site evaluation, etc. 
Aerial photographs and satellite images can provide this vital information in combination with
other data sources. Computerization enables the user to process, manipulate and analyze
these data and to display the results in maps and tables.
<p>
The Urban Survey and Human Settlement Analysis Division of ITC is concerned with
education, research and consulting in urban surveys and analysis and their application in
urban planning and management processes. The Division offers courses at the postgraduate
diploma level (code USH.3) and at the MSc degree level (code USH.2).
<p>
The postgraduate diploma and MSc degree courses in Geoinformation Systems for Urban
Applications (GIU.3 and GIU.2) are related to the courses described here.
<p>
The USH courses deal with the collection, analysis and presentation of urban planning and
management data, particularly in developing countries. Interpretation of aerial photos and
satellite images, as well as data collection in the field, are important elements of these
courses. Intensive use is made of geographic information systems. Much attention is given to
monitoring, suitability modelling, and to settlement planning in hazard areas.

<h2>OBJECTIVES</h2>

Upon completion of the course, participants should be able to:
<ul>
<li>collect urban planning data by interpretation of aerial photographs and satellite images and
by field surveys;
<li>use computers as a tool for storing, processing and analyzing the data;
<li>make use of these data for urban planning and management purposes;
<li>carry out applied research in selected urban science fields (USH.2 only).
</ul>
<p>
To achieve these objectives, participants will:
<ul>
<li>acquire the knowledge to analyze urban planning problems in terms of the thematic
information needed;
<li>learn to design a survey with aerial photographs and satellite images;
<li>be trained to collect the necessary data by aerial photo interpretation and fieldwork;
<li>gain experience in the analysis of data and the presentation of urban information for use in
the urban planning and management process;
<li>plan and implement a research project and write an MSc thesis (USH.2 only).
</ul>

<h2>TARGET GROUPS</h2>

The postgraduate diploma course (USH.3) is intended for urban planners, urban
geographers, architects, civil engineers and urban managers trained at university level and
working in local governments, national ministries, urban consulting firms or universities.
<p>
The MSc degree course (USH.2) is intended for professionals who wish to develop their
knowledge and skills in urban sciences through further study and research, leading to an
MSc degree.

<h2>ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATIONS</h2>

For admission to the USH.3 and the USH.2 courses, applicants should hold a BSc degree
from a recognized university in one of the disciplines relevant to urban studies (urban
planning, architecture, civil engineering, geography, demography, economics, sociology) or
be able to demonstrate an equivalent level of education in one of these disciplines.
Preferably they should also have some years of working experience. 
<p>
Applicants for the USH.2 course should have gained their BSc degree with good marks.
Participants of the USH.2 course should attain an average weighted mark of at least 75 in the
USH.3 course and show an aptitude for independent study in order to be admitted to the
USH.2 course. If a participant does not qualify, he or she will continue in the postgraduate
diploma course (USH.3).
<p>
Interpretation of aerial photographs and satellite images is an important part of the course
curriculum. Candidates should therefore have good stereoscopic vision as well as normal
colour vision. Proficiency in the English language (minimum requirement Test of English as a
Foreign Language (TOEFL) 500 or British Council test 6.0) is also required.
<p>
Applications for academic admission should be forwarded directly to ITC using the official
application form which is available from ITC's Student Registration Office.

<h2>COURSE STRUCTURE AND CONTENTS</h2>

The second part of the course is conducted largely on an individual basis and centers on a
research topic leading to a thesis. Advanced coursework is required in a minimum of four
subjects (three months). At least one currently available raster based GIS for urban planning
analysis purposes should be mastered.
<p>
The research/thesis part (approximately 11 months) will focus on a research project.
Research topics will preferably be linked to the existing research programmes in the Division.
The possibility of a research project in the home country of the participant is not excluded.


<h2>STARTING DATE AND DURATION</h2>

In 1995 the courses in Urban Survey and Human Settlement Analysis start in the first week
of September and last 10 months (USH.3) and 21 months (USH.2). The first week is
reserved for the introduction and the last week for presentations of final assignment results,
clearance formalities and the diploma/degree ceremony. The second part of the USH.2
course (14 months) starts in the first week of April.

<h2>QUALIFICATION AWARDED</h2>

After completing the course and passing the required examinations, participants are awarded
a postgraduate diploma (USH.3) or an MSc degree (USH.2), accompanied by a course
record.

<h2>ACCOMMODATION</h2>

Course participants are accommodated in the DISH Hotel. This is situated in the center of
Enschede, ten minutes' walk from the ITC building.

<h1>ITC develops and transfers knowledge on Geoinformation 
                 management for sustainable development</h1>

One of mankind's greatest challenges is achieving an appropriate balance between the development
of natural resources and maintaining an optimal natural environment. To meet this challenge, we
need detailed and reliable geoinformation and geoinformation management tools. At the International
Institute for Aerospace Survey and Earth Sciences (ITC), knowledge of geoinformation management
is amply available, and continually being developed and extended. By means of education, research
and consulting we contribute to capacity-building in the developing world. Much attention is given
to the transfer of technologies to organizations in developing countries. 'Geoinformation
management', 'worldwide' and 'innovative' are our key words. We concentrate on earth observation,
the generation of spatial information and on the development of data integration methods. We
provide tools that can support the processes of planning and decision making for sustainable
development and the alleviation of poverty in developing countries. The Institute has a scientific staff
of some 200 professionals of 25 nationalities. Since 1950 more than 11,500 students from over 150
countries have followed one of ITC's 40 courses, leading to PhD and MSc degrees and post graduate
diplomas.
<p>
The Department of Geoinformatics has recently redefined its commitment within the ITC mission
as: The development and transfer of knowledge of geoinformation technology and its sustainable
implementation in support of social and economic progress in Developing Countries.
<p>
To implement this commitment the department has adopted a new structure of four academic chairs.
Three of these represent the technical knowledge fields in Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing,
Cartography, and Spatial Information Theory and Applied Computer Science. The developments in
these technical fields will be attuned to the principles of Geoinformatics Management and
Infrastructure which is the fourth academic chair. This is to ensure continuing relevance to
implementation of technological solutions to local problems in sympathy with their organizational
an institutional conditions.
To carry out the necessary research and development, the establishment of a complete and fully
networked Geoinformatics Lab is being designed for implementation before mid 1996. It will play
a catalyzing role in the prototyping of relevant technical solutions and to interdisciplinary research
in the Institute.
<hr>
<b>The Geoinformatics Department</b> is offering the following vacancies for individuals who are

<P>
<PRE>
Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
675 Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC2">Preamble</A></H2>
<P>
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.
<P>
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
<P>
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
<P>
  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.
<P>
  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.
<P>
  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.
<P>
  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
<P>
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC3">TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</A></H2>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
<P>
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
<P>
<LI>
You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.
<P>
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
<P>
<LI>
You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
<P>
<LI>
You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.
<P>
<LI>
If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
</OL>
<P>
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
<P>
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.
<P>
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.
<P>
<LI>
You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>
Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
<P>
<LI>
Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,
<P>
<LI>
Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
</OL>
<P>
The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.
<P>
If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
<P>
<LI>
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.
<P>
<LI>
You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.
<P>
<LI>
Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.
<P>
<LI>
If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
<P>
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.
<P>
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.
<P>
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.
<P>
<LI>
If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
<P>
<LI>
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.
<P>
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.
<P>
<LI>
If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
<P>
<H2>NO WARRANTY</H2>
<P>
<LI>
BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
<P>
<LI>
IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
</OL>
<P>
<H2>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</H2>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC4">How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</A></H2>
<P>
  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
<P>
  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
<P>
<PRE>
<VAR>one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.</VAR>
Copyright (C) 19<VAR>yy</VAR>  <VAR>name of author</VAR>

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License

</PRE>
<P>
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
<P>
If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details

<P>
The hypothetical commands <SAMP>`show w'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`show c'</SAMP> should show
the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than <SAMP>`show w'</SAMP> and
<SAMP>`show c'</SAMP>; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever
suits your program.
<P>
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may

<P>
I came across this guide while reading "EFFector Online Volume 5 No. 15,
8/20/1993" (A Publication of the Electronic Frontier Foundation,
ISSN 1062-9424), that is available via <TT>comp.org.eff.news</TT> and
immediately decided to get my hands on it. After browsing through the
raw ASCII text file, I thought that such a useful thing, should have a more
beautiful "face" (and fewer "bugs").
<P>
As Shari points out, the EFF is still "fishing for a publisher." In other
words, it's far from being clear when this guide will be available as hard
copy, unless you want to print out the "buggy" ASCII file.
Thus, I started over to make the bulk a <EM>Texinfo</EM> document, loosely
modelled after
<VAR>Brendan Kehoe</VAR>'s <I>Zen and the Art of the Internet</I>,
originally written for Widener University's, Computer Science Department,
<A NAME="IDX1"></A>
and later published as:

<I>Zen and the Art of the Internet: A Beginner's

Englewood Cliffs, NJ. 112 pages.
The 1st Edition, (February, 2nd) is still available via anonymous ftp from
<B>ftp.cs.widener.edu</B> and many other Internet archives.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
It was the first comprehensive book on the Internet available.
(Despite the "traditional" postings in

<P>
Situation has changed dramatically, since. More and more books
get into the stores, and hopefully facilitate the life

of "newbies" on the Net. Just to mention some IMHO excellent examples:

Some more nights have passed, and "GNU Info" format is fully supported,
now. You can use either Emacs in INFO mode, or just GNU's <CODE>info</CODE>
browser (also available as <CODE>xinfo</CODE> for the X window system):
type <SAMP>`info -f bdgtti-2.2.info'</SAMP> and read "Dummy's" online in
hypertextual fashion.
<P>
But since edition 1.01, "Dummy's" not only features an "Info" version.
It also comes with HTML support, i.e. the HyperText Markup Language format,
that is used by the <A HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">World-Wide Web project</A>
(see section <A HREF="bdg_181.html#SEC184">Gophers</A> for some more ideas on this).
The <CODE>bdgtti-2.2*.html</CODE> files can thus be browsed using the
WWW tools: from within <CODE>xmosaic</CODE>,
e.g. load <SAMP>`bdgtti-2.2_toc.html'</SAMP>, and there you go!
<P>
Finally, some more folks have helped along the way.

Welcome to the Christmas issue of one of the <EM>most read</EM> books on
the Internet! This time, we only fix the bugs that have been reported
from most the folks listed below.
<P>
From this edition on, the standard A4, and US letter size versions are
merged into one directory. Moreoever, has the EFF a new online activist,
<A NAME="IDX15"></A>
named <VAR>Stanton McCandlish</VAR> <TT>&lt;mech@eff.org&gt;</TT>
who really seems to take care about this project, and has properly set up
the EFF's FTP site. So, the "EFF is out of pace" messages from former
postings entitled <I>FAQ: Big Dummy's Guide, Life and Everything...</I>,
(that also serves as the README file to the Texinfo release), have become
obsolete.
<P>
A major rework of this guide, including an extensive overhaul of the
World-Wide Web chapter, and the HTML version is planned
and scheduled for "mid-of-next-year-or-so".
I thus recommend not to hold your breath. You shouldn't expect Texinfo
edition 1.04 to come out prior to July '94.
<P>
Thanks to all of you, who sent bug fixes, made suggestions, or just
dropped a <I>Thanks for all the Fish!</I> message.

Never say never, folks. Adam Gaffin, released version 1.4 of his ASCII
version on December 20th, and I just couldn't resist to get the Texinfo
edition back into the game, and move it from 1.03 to 1.4.
So here it is. Anyway, the statement from above still holds true, it just
needs a little bit of "adjustment."

<P>
<EM>Welcome to the Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet, version 2.2.</EM>
<P>
The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is proud to have sponsored
the production of the <EM>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet</EM>.  EFF is a
nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C., dedicated to ensuring
that everyone has access to the newly emerging communications technologies
vital to active participation in the events of our world.  As more and more
information is available online, new doors open up for those who have
access to that information.  Unfortunately, unless access is broadly
encouraged, individuals can be disenfranchised and doors can close, as
well. The Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet was written to help open some
doors to the vast amounts of information available on the world's largest
<A NAME="IDX17"></A>
network, the Internet.
<P>
The spark for the <EM>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet</EM> was ignited in
a few informal conversations that included myself and <VAR>Steve Cisler</VAR> of Apple
Computer, Inc., in June of 1991.  With the support of Apple Computer, EFF
engaged <VAR>Adam Gaffin</VAR> to write the book and actually took on the project in
<A NAME="IDX18"></A>
<A NAME="IDX19"></A>
<A NAME="IDX20"></A>
<A NAME="IDX21"></A>
September of 1991.
<P>
The idea was to write a guide to the Internet for people who had
little or no experience with network communications.  We intended to post
this guide to the Net in ASCII and HyperCard formats and to give it away on
disk, as well as have a print edition available.  We have more than
realized our goal.  Individuals from as geographically far away as Germany,
Italy, Canada, South Africa, Japan, Scotland, Norway, and Antarctica have
all sent electronic mail to say that they downloaded the Big Dummy's Guide
to the Internet.  The guide is now available in a wide array of formats,
including ACSCII text, HyperCard, World Wide Web, PostScript and
AmigaGuide.  And the guide will be published in a printed format by MIT
<A NAME="IDX22"></A>
<A NAME="IDX23"></A>
<A NAME="IDX24"></A>
<A NAME="IDX25"></A>
Press in June of 1994.
<P>
EFF would like to thank author Adam Gaffin for doing a terrific job
of explaining the Net in such a nonthreatening way.  We'd also like to
thank the folks at Apple, especially Steve Cisler of the Apple Library, for
their support of our efforts to bring this guide to you.
<P>
We invite you to join with EFF in our fight to ensure that equal
access to the networks and free speech are protected in newly emerging
technologies.  We are a membership organization, and through donations like
yours, we can continue to sponsor important projects to make communications
easier.  Information about the Electronic Frontier Foundation and some of
the work that we do can be found at the end of this book.
<P>
We hope that the <EM>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet</EM> helps you learn
about whole new worlds, where new friends and experiences are sure to be
yours.  Enjoy!

<A NAME="IDX27"></A>
Co-founder, Electronic Frontier Foundation.
<P>
New communities are being built today.  You cannot see them, except
on a computer screen.  You cannot visit them, except through your
keyboard.  Their highways are wires and optical fibers; their language a
series of ones and zeroes.
<P>
Yet these communities of cyberspace are as real and vibrant as any
you could find on a globe or in an atlas.  Those are real people on the
other sides of those monitors.  And freed from physical limitations,
these people are developing new types of cohesive and effective
communities - ones which are defined more by common interest and purpose
than by an accident of geography, ones on which what really counts is
what you say and think and feel, not how you look or talk or how old
<A NAME="IDX28"></A>
you are.
<P>
The oldest of these communities is that of the scientists, which
actually predates computers.  Scientists have long seen themselves
as an international community, where ideas were more important than
national origin.  It is not surprising that the scientists were the
first to adopt the new electronic media as their principal means of
<A NAME="IDX29"></A>
day-to-day communication.
<P>
I look forward to a day in which everybody, not just scientists,
<A NAME="IDX30"></A>
can enjoy similar benefits of a global community.
<P>
But how exactly does community grow out of a computer network? It
does so because the network enables new forms of communication.
<P>
The most obvious example of these new digital communications media
is electronic mail, but there are many others.  We should begin to think
of mailing lists, newsgroups, file and document archives, etc. as just
the first generation of new forms of information and communications
media.  The digital media of computer networks, by virtue of their
design and the enabling technology upon which they ride, are
fundamentally different from the now dominant mass media of television, 
radio, newspapers and magazines.  Digital communications media are
inherently capable of being more interactive, more participatory, more
egalitarian, more decentralized, and less hierarchical.
<P>
As such, the types of social relations and communities which can be
built on these media share these characteristics.  Computer networks
encourage the active participation of individuals rather than the
passive non-participation induced by television narcosis.
<P>
In mass media, the vast majority of participants are passive
recipients of information.  In digital communications media, the vast
majority of participants are active creators of information as well as
recipients.  This type of symmetry has previously only been found in
media like the telephone.  But while the telephone is almost entirely a
medium for private one-to-one communication, computer network
applications such as electronic mailing lists, conferences, and bulletin
<A NAME="IDX31"></A>
<A NAME="IDX32"></A>
boards, serve as a medium of group or "many-to-many" communication.
<P>
The new forums atop computer networks are the great levelers and
reducers of organizational hierarchy.  Each user has, at least in
theory, access to every other user, and an equal chance to be heard.
Some U.S. high-tech companies, such as Microsoft and Borland, already
use this to good advantage: their CEO's -- <VAR>Bill Gates</VAR> and
<VAR>Philippe Kahn</VAR>
-- are directly accessible to all employees via electronic mail.  This
creates a sense that the voice of the individual employee really
matters.  More generally, when corporate communication is facilitated by
electronic mail, decision-making processes can be far more inclusive and
<A NAME="IDX33"></A>
<A NAME="IDX34"></A>
<A NAME="IDX35"></A>
<A NAME="IDX36"></A>
<A NAME="IDX37"></A>
participatory.
<P>
Computer networks do not require tightly centralized administrative
control.  In fact, decentralization is necessary to enable rapid growth
of the network itself.  Tight controls strangle growth.  This
decentralization promotes inclusiveness, for it lowers barriers to entry
for new parties wishing to join the network.
<P>
Given these characteristics, networks hold tremendous potential to
enrich our collective cultural, political, and social lives and enhance
democratic values everywhere.
<P>
And the Internet, and the UUCP and related networks connected to
it, represents an outstanding example of a computer network with these
qualities.  It is an open network of networks, not a single unitary
network, but an ensemble of interconnected systems which operate on the 
basis of multiple implementations of accepted, non-proprietary
protocols, standards and interfaces.
<P>
One of its important characteristics is that new networks, host
systems, and users may readily join the network -- the network is open
to all.
<P>
The openness (in all senses) of the Internet reflects, I believe,
the sensibilities and values of its architects.  Had the Internet
somehow been developed outside the world of research and education, it's
less likely to have had such an open architecture.  Future generations
will be indebted to this community for the wisdom of building these
types of open systems.
<P>
Still, the fundamental qualities of the Net, such as its
decentralization, also pose problems.  How can full connectivity be 
maintained in the face of an ever-expanding number of connected
networks, for example?  What of software bugs that bring down computers,
or human crackers who try to do the same?  But these problems can and
<A NAME="IDX38"></A>
<A NAME="IDX39"></A>
will be solved.
<P>
Digital media can be the basis of new forms of political discourse,
in which citizens form and express their views on the important public
issues of the day. There is more than one possible vision of such
electronic democracy, however. Let's look at some examples of the
potential power, and problems, of the new digital media.
<P>
The idea of something called an "electronic town meeting"  received
considerable attention in 1992 with <VAR>Ross Perot</VAR>'s presidential campaign
<A NAME="IDX40"></A>
(or, at least, its first incarnation).
<P>
Perot's original vision, from 20 or so years ago,  was that viewers
would watch a debate on television and fill out punch cards which would
be mailed in and collated.  Now we could do it with 800 telephone
numbers.
<P>
In the current atmosphere of disaffection, alienation and cynicism,
anything that promotes greater citizen involvement seems a good idea.
People are turned off by politicians in general -- witness the original
surge of support for Perot as outsider who would go in and clean up the
mess -- and the idea of going right to the people is appealing,
<P>
What's wrong with this picture? The individual viewer is a passive
recipient of the views of experts.  The only action taken by the citizen
is in expressing a preference for one of three pre-constructed
alternatives.  While this might be occasionally useful, it's
unsophisticated and falls far short of the real potential of electronic
democracy. We've been reduced to forming our judgments on the basis of
mass media's portrayal of the personality and character of the
candidates.
<P>
All this is in contrast to robust political debates already found
on various on-line computer systems, from CompuServe to Usenet.
Through these new media, the issues of the day, ranging from national
security in the post-Cold War era to comparative national health care
systems, are fiercely discussed in a wide variety of bulletin boards,
conferences, and newsgroups.
<P>
What I see in online debate are multiple active participants, not
just experts, representing every point of view, in discussions that
unfold over extended periods of time. What this shows is that, far from
being alienated and disaffected from the political process, people like
to talk and discuss -- and take action -- if they have the opportunity
to do so.  Mass media don't permit that.  But these new media are more
akin to a gathering around the cracker barrel at the general store --
only extended over hundreds, thousands of miles, in cyberspace, rather
than in one physical location.
<P>
Recent years have shown the potential power of these new media.
We have also seen several examples of where talk translated into 
action.
<P>
In 1987, the Federal Communications Commission proposed changing
the way certain online providers paid for access to local phone service.
Online, this quickly became known as the "modem tax" and generated a
storm of protest.  The FCC withdrew the idea, but not quickly enough:
the "modem tax" has penetrated so deeply into the crevices of the Net
that it has taken up a permanent and ghostly residence as a kind of
virtual or cognitive virus, which periodically causes a re-infection of
the systems and its users.  FCC commissioners continue to receive
substantial mail on this even though the original issue is long dead; in
fact, it has generated more mail than any other issue in the history of
<A NAME="IDX41"></A>
<A NAME="IDX42"></A>
<A NAME="IDX43"></A>
the FCC.
<P>
More recently, <VAR>Jim Manzi</VAR>, chairman of Lotus Development Corp.,
received more than 30,000 e-mail messages when the company was getting
ready to sell a database containing records on tens of millions of
Americans.  The flood of electronic complaints about the threat to
privacy helped force the company to abandon the project.
Issues of narrow but vital interest to the online community give a hint
<A NAME="IDX44"></A>
<A NAME="IDX45"></A>
of the organizing power of the Net.
<P>
In August, 1991, the managers of a Soviet computer network known as
Relcom stayed online during an abortive coup, relaying eyewitness
accounts and news of actions against the coup to the West and to the
<A NAME="IDX46"></A>
<A NAME="IDX47"></A>
rest of Russia.
<P>
And many public interest non-profit organizations and special
interest groups already use bulletin boards heavily as a means of
communicating among their members and organizing political activity.
<P>
But all is not perfect online.  The quality of discourse is often
very low.  Discussion is often trivial and boring and bereft of
persuasive reason.  Discourse often sinks to the level of "flaming," of
personal attacks, instead of substantive discussion.  Flaming. Those
with the most time to spend often wind up dominating the debate -- a
triumph of quantity of time available over quality of content.
<P>
It seems like no place for serious discussion. Information overload
is also a problem.  There is simply far too much to read to keep up
with.  It is all without organization.  How can this be addressed?
<P>
Recent innovations in the design of software used to connect
people to the Net and the process of online discussion itself reveal
some hope.
<P>
Flaming is universal, but different systems handle it in different
<A NAME="IDX48"></A>
ways.  Both the technology and cultural norms matter.
<P>
On Usenet, for instance, most news reader applications support a
feature known as a "killfile," which allows an individual to screen
out postings by a particular user or on a particular subject.  It is
also sometimes referred to as "the bozo filter."  This spares the user
who is sufficiently sophisticated from further flamage, but it does
nothing to stop the problem at its source.
<P>
Censorship would be one solution. But what else can be done without
resorting to unacceptably heavy-handed tactics of censorship?  There is a
great tradition of respect for free speech on these systems, and to
censor public postings or even ban a poster for annoying or offensive
content is properly seen as unacceptable, in my opinion.
<P>
Some systems use cultural norms, rather than software, to deal with
flame wars.  These online communities have developed practices which
rely more on a shared, internalized sense of appropriate behavior  than
<A NAME="IDX49"></A>
on censorship, for instance.  The WELL (Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link) is a
relatively small online conferencing system based in the San Francisco
Bay area.  On the WELL, individuals who get into a fight are encouraged
to move the discussion out of the public conference and into e-mail.
The encouragement is provided not only by the host of the conference,
but also by the users.  It is part of the culture, not part of the
technology.
<P>
WELL hosts are volunteers who facilitate the discussion of a
particular subject.  While they have the power to censor individual
postings, the power is very rarely used and only as a last resort, as it
has been found that dispute resolution by talking it out among the
parties is a superior method of problem solving in the long run.
<P>
It is not an accident that the WELL has a uniquely high quality
of conversation.  Nor is it coincidental that it developed as a small
and originally isolated community (now on the Net) which gave it a
chance to develop its own norms or that key management of the system
came from "The Farm," a large, successful commune of the 1960's and
<A NAME="IDX50"></A>
<A NAME="IDX51"></A>
1970's led by <VAR>Stephen Gaskin</VAR>.
<P>
We still know very little about the facilitation of online
conversations.  It is a subject well worth further formal study and
experimentation.
<P>
Some problems have to do with the unrefined and immature format and
structure of the discussion medium itself.  The undifferentiated stream
of new messages marching along in 80 columns of ASCII text creates a
kind of hypnotic trance.  Compare this with the typical multiplicity of
type fonts, varied layouts, images, and pictures of the printed page.
<P>
New media take time to develop and to be shaped.  Reading text on a
terminal reminds me of looking at the Gutenberg Bible. The modern book
took a century to develop after the invention of printing with movable
type and the first Western printed books.  <VAR>Aldus Manutius</VAR> and the
inventions of modern typefaces, pagination, the table of contents, the
index, all of which gave the book its modern form, came later, were done
by different people, and were of a different order than the invention of
printing with movable type itself.  The new electronic media are
<A NAME="IDX52"></A>
<A NAME="IDX53"></A>
undergoing a similar evolution.
<P>
Key inventions are occurring slowly, for example, development of
software tools that will allow the dissemination of audio and video
across the Net. This type of software has usually been done so far by
volunteers who have given away the results.  It's a great thing, but
it's not sufficient, given how hard it is to develop robust software.
Innovation in the application space will also be driven by entrepreneurs
and independent software vendors at such point as they perceive a
business opportunity to create such products (it would be nice if
creators did it for art's sake but this seems unlikely).
<P>
There are some requirements to provide incentives to attract
additional software development.  This requires a competitive free
market in network services at all levels to serve the expanding user
demand for network services. It requires a technologically mature
network able to support these services.
<P>
And there must be a user population, current or prospective,
interested in paying for better applications -- and not just the current
base of technically sophisticated users and students, though they will
absolutely benefit.
<P>
There are multiple classes of new application opportunities.  E-mail
is overloaded because there aren't readily available alternatives yet.
New and different kinds of tools are needed for collaborative work.
Computer conferencing, as it evolves, may be sufficient for discussion
and debate.  But by itself, it cannot really support collaborative work,
in the sense of readily enabling a group to make decisions efficiently,
represent and track the status of its work process.  Trying to run an
organization via e-mail mailing list is very different than trying to 
have a discussion.
<P>
Computer networks can only fully realize their potential as
innovative communications media in an environment which encourages free
and open expression.
<P>
In some countries, legal principles of free speech protect freedom
of expression in traditional media such as the printed word.  But once
communication moves to new digital media and crosses
international borders, such legal protections fall away.  As <VAR>John Perry
Barlow</VAR>, the co-founder of EFF puts it: "In Cyberspace, the First
Amendment is a local ordinance."  There is no international legal
authority which protects free expression on trans-national networks.
Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights calls for the
protection of free expression in all media, but the declaration falls
<A NAME="IDX54"></A>
<A NAME="IDX55"></A>
<A NAME="IDX56"></A>
far short of being binding.
<P>
And if we're to take seriously the idea of the electronic online
forum, we have to deal with the access issue.  If the only people with
access to the medium are well-educated, affluent, techno-literate elite,
it won't be sufficiently inclusive to represent all points of view.
<P>
We also need, fundamentally, a better infrastructure (the highway
system for information).  As we move from the high-speed Internet to the
even more powerful National Research and Education Network, we need to
look at how to bring the power of these new media into the homes of
everybody who might want it.  Addressing this "last mile" problem (phone
networks are now largely digitized, fiber-optic systems, except for the
mile between your home and the nearest switching station) should be a
priority.
<P>
Computer networks will eventually become ubiquitous around the
world.  We should therefore be concerned with the impact on society that
they have, the opportunities to improve society, and the dangers that
they pose.   Fundamentally, we are optimists who believe in the
potential of networks to enhance democratic values of openness,
diversity, and innovation.
<P>
Because the medium is so new, it is important now to develop
policies at the national and international level that help achieve the
potential of computer networks for society as a whole. By the time
television was recognized as a vast wasteland it was already too late to
change. There is a rare opportunity to develop policies in advance of a
technologically and economically mature system which would be hard to
change.

<B>A Superhighway Through the Wasteland?</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
   <EM>(Washington)</EM> Telecommunications and cable TV executives, seeking to
allay concerns over their proposed megamergers, insist that the coming
electronic superhighway will be an educational and informational tool as
well as a cornucopia of interactive entertainment. Allow the marriage
between entertainment and communications giants, we are told, and they will
connect students with learning resources, provide a forum for political
discourse, increase economic competitiveness and speed us into the
multimedia information age.
<P>
   Both broadcast and cable TV were introduced with similar fanfare. The
results have been disappointing. Because of regulatory failure and the
limits of the technology, they failed to be saviors of education or
political life. We love the tube but recognize that it is largely a
cultural wasteland.
<P>
    For the Government to break this cycle of promise and disappointment,
communications mergers should be approved or barred based on detailed,
enforceable commitments that the electronic superhighway will meet public
goals. The amount of electronic material the superhighway can carry is
dizzying compared to the relatively narrow range of broadcast TV and the
limited number of cable channels. Properly constructed and regulated, it
could be open to all who wish to speak, publish and communicate.
<P>
   None of the interactive services will be possible, however, if we have
an eight-lane data superhighway rushing into every home and only a narrow
footpath coming back out. Instead of settling for a multimedia version of
the same entertainment that is increasingly dissatisfying on today's TV, we
need a superhighway that encourages the production and distribution of a
broader, more diverse range of programming.
<P>
   The superhighway should be required to provide so-called open platform
services. In today's channel-based cable TV system, program producers must
negotiate for channel space with cable companies around the country. In an
open platform network, we would avoid that bottleneck. Every person would
have access to the entire superhighway, so programmers could distribute
information directly to consumers.
<P>
   Consumers would become producers: individuals and small organizations
could create and distribute programs to anyone on the highway who wants
them. Open platform services will spur diversity in the electronic media,
just as low production and distribution costs make possible a wide variety
of newspapers and magazines.
<P>
   To prevent abuses by media giants that because of recent Federal court
decisions will control the pipeline into the home and much of the content
delivered over it, we need new laws. Like today's phone companies, the
companies controlling the superhighway must be required to carry other
programmers' content, just as phone companies must provide service to
anyone who is willing to pay for it. We must guarantee that anyone who,
say, wants to start an alternative news network or a forum for political
discussion is given an outlet to do so.
<P>
   Americans will come to depend on the superhighway even more than they
need the telephone. The guarantee of universal telephone service must be
expanded to include universal access to the superhighway. Although market
forces will help keep the new technology affordable, we need laws to
protect consumers when competition fails.
<P>
   And because several companies will operate the highway, each must be
required to interconnect with the others. Likewise, the new computers that
will give us access to the superhighway should be built according to
commonly accepted standards.
<P>
   Also, even an open, competitive market will leave out organizations with
limited resources such as schools and libraries. To compensate for market
oversights, we must insure that money -- whether through Federal support or
a tax on the companies that will control the superhighway -- is made
available to these institutions. Finally, people won't use the new
technology unless they feel that their privacy is protected. Technical
means, such as recently developed encryption techniques, must be made
available to all users. And clear legal guidelines for individual control
over access to and reuse of personal information must be established.
Companies that sell entertainment services will have a record of what their
customers' interests are; these records must remain confidential.
<P>
   Bell Atlantic, T.C.I., Time-Warner, U.S. West and other companies
involved in proposed mergers have promised to allow the public full access
to the superhighway. But they are asking policy makers to trust that,
profits aside, they will use their new positions for the public good.
<P>
   Rather than opposing mergers or blindly trusting competition to shape
the data highways, Congress should make the mergers hinge on detailed
commitments to provide affordable services to all Americans. Some
legislators, led by Representative Ed Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts,
are working to enact similar requirements; these efforts deserve support.
<P>
   The best approach would be to amend these requirements to the
Communications Act of 1934. Still the central law on open access, an
updated Communications Act would codify the terms of a new social contract
between the the telecommunications industry and the American people.

<P>
By <EM>Adam Gaffin</EM> <TT>&lt;adamg@world.std.com&gt;</TT><BR>
Senior Writer, Network World, Framingham, Mass.
<P>
Welcome to the Internet! You're about to start a journey through a 
unique land without frontiers, a place that is everywhere at once -- even 
though it exists physically only as a series of electrical impulses.  
You'll be joining a growing community of millions of people around the 
world who use this global resource on a daily basis.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX59"></A>
<A NAME="IDX60"></A>
<A NAME="IDX61"></A>
With this book, you will be able to use the Internet to:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
Stay in touch with friends, relatives and colleagues around the
world, at a fraction of the cost of phone calls or even air
mail.
<P>
<LI>
Discuss everything from archaeology to zoology with people in 
several different languages.    
<P>
<LI>
Tap into thousands of information databases and libraries 
worldwide.
<P>
<LI>
Retrieve any of thousands of documents, journals, books and
computer programs.
<P>
<LI>
Stay up to date with wire-service news and sports and 
with official weather reports.
<P>
<LI>
Play live, "real time" games with dozens of other people at once.
</UL>
<P>
And you will have become the newest member of this ever growing
community. If you stay and contribute, the Net will be richer for it --
and so will you.
<P>
But it will take a sense of adventure, a willingness to learn and
an ability to take a deep breath every once in awhile.
<P>
Connecting to "the Net" today, takes something of a sense of 
adventure, a willingness to learn and an ability to take a deep breath 
every once in awhile. Visiting the Net today is a lot like journeying to 
a foreign country.  There are so many things to see and do, but 
everything at first will seem so, well, foreign.  
<P>
When you first arrive, you won't be able to read the street signs.
You'll get lost.  If you're unlucky, you may even run into some locals
who'd just as soon you went back to where you came from.  If this
weren't enough, the entire country is constantly under construction;
every day, it seems like there's something new for you to figure out.
<P>
Fortunately, most of the locals are actually friendly.  In fact, the 
Net actually has a rich tradition of helping out visitors and newcomers.  
Until very recently, there were few written guides for ordinary people, 
and the Net grew largely through an "oral" tradition in which the
old-timers helped the newcomers.
<P>
Here's where you take a deep breath.  Fortunately, most of the
natives are actually friendly.  In fact, the Net actually has a rich
tradition of helping out visitors and newcomers.  With few written
guides for ordinary people, the Net has grown in large part one person
at a time -- if somebody helps you learn your way around, it's almost
expected you'll repay the favor some day by helping somebody else.
<P>
So when you connect, don't be afraid to ask for help.  You'll be
surprised at how many people will lend a hand!
<P>
Without such folks, in fact, this guide would not be possible. My 
thanks to all the people who have written with suggestion, additions and 
corrections since the Big Dummy's Guide first appeared on the Internet in 
1993.
<P>
Special thanks go to the following people, who, whether they know it 
or not, provided particular help -- and to my loving wife Nancy:
<P>
Rhonda Chapman, Jim Cocks, Tom Czarnik, Christopher Davis, David 
DeSimone, Jeanne deVoto, Phil Eschallier, Nico Garcia, Joe Granrose, 
Joerg Heitkoetter, Joe Ilacqua, Jonathan Kamens, Peter Kaminski, Thomas 
A. Kreeger, Stanton McCandlish, Leanne Phillips, Nancy Reynolds, Helen 
Trillian Rose, Barry Shein, Jennifer "Moira" Smith, Gerard van der Leun 
and Scott Yanoff. 
<P>
If you have any suggestions or comments on how to make this guide 
better, I'd love to hear them.  You can reach me via e-mail at

<H2><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC11">Ready, Set...</A></H2>
<P>
The world is just a phone call away.  With a computer and modem, 
you'll be able to connect to the Internet, the world's largest computer 
network (and if you're lucky, you won't even need the modem; many 
colleges and companies now give their students or employees direct access 
to the Internet).
<P>
The phone line can be your existing voice line -- just remember
that if you have any extensions, you (and everybody else in the house
or office) won't be able to use them for voice calls while you are connected
<A NAME="IDX62"></A>
to the Net.
<P>
A modem is a sort of translator between computers and the phone
system. It's needed because computers and the phone system process and
transmit data, or information, in two different, and incompatible
ways.  Computers "talk" digitally; that is, they store and process
information as a series of discrete numbers.  The phone network relies
on analog signals, which on an oscilloscope would look like a series
of waves.  When your computer is ready to transmit data to another
computer over a phone line, your modem converts the computer numbers
into these waves (which sound like a lot of screeching) -- it
"modulates" them.  In turn, when information waves come into your
modem, it converts them into numbers your computer can process, by
<A NAME="IDX63"></A>
<A NAME="IDX64"></A>
<A NAME="IDX65"></A>
"demodulating" them.
<P>
Increasingly, computers come with modems already installed. If
yours didn't, you'll have to decide what speed modem to get.  Modem
speeds are judged in "bps rate" or bits per second.  One bps means 
the modem can transfer roughly one bit per second; the greater the
bps rate, the more quickly a modem can send and receive information.  
<A NAME="IDX66"></A>
A letter or character is made up of eight bits.
<P>
You can now buy a 2400-bps modem for well under $60 -- and most now 
come with the ability to handle fax messages as well.  At prices that now 
start around $150, you can buy a modem that can transfer data at 14,400
bps (and often even faster, using special compression techniques).  If you 
think you might be using the Net to transfer large numbers of files, a 
faster modem is always worth the price. It will dramatically reduce the 
amount of time your modem or computer is tied up transferring files and, if 
you are paying for Net access by the hour, will save you quite a bit in 
<A NAME="IDX67"></A>
<A NAME="IDX68"></A>
online charges. 
<P>
Like the computer to which it attaches, a modem is useless
without software to tell it how to work.  Most modems today come with
easy-to-install software.  Try the program out. If you find it
difficult to use or understand, consider a trip to the local software
store to find a better program.  You can spend several hundred dollars
on a communications program, but unless you have very specialized
needs, this will be a waste of money, as there are a host of excellent
programs available for around $100 or less.  Among the basic features you 
want to look for are a choice of different "protocols" (more on them in a 
bit) for transferring files to and from the Net and the ability to write 
"script" or "command" files that let you automate such steps as logging 
into a host system. 
<P>
When you buy a modem and the software, ask the dealer how to
install and use them.  Try out the software if you can.  If the dealer
can't help you, find another dealer.  You'll not only save yourself a
lot of frustration, you'll also have practiced the prime Internet 
directive: <EM>"Ask. People Know."</EM>
<P>
To fully take advantage of the Net, you must spend a few minutes
going over the manuals or documentation that comes with your software.
There are a few things you should pay special attention to: uploading
and downloading; screen capturing (sometimes called "screen dumping");
logging; how to change protocols; and terminal emulation.  It is also
essential to know how to convert a file created with your word
processing program into "ASCII" or "text" format, which will let you
share your thoughts with others across the Net.
<P>
Uploading is the process of sending a file from your computer to a
system on the Net. Downloading is retrieving a file from somewhere on
the Net to your computer. In general, things in cyberspace go "up" to
<A NAME="IDX69"></A>
the Net and come "down" to you.
<P>
Chances are your software will come with a choice of several
"protocols" to use for these transfers.  These protocols are systems
designed to ensure that line noise or static does not cause errors that
could ruin whatever information you are trying to transfer.
Essentially, when using a protocol, you are transferring a file in a
series of pieces.  After each piece is sent or received, your computer
and the Net system compare it. If the two pieces don't match exactly,
they transfer it again, until they agree that the information they both
have is identical.  If, after several tries, the information just
doesn't make it across, you'll either get an error message or your
screen will freeze.  In that case, try it again.  If, after five tries,
you are still stymied, something is wrong with a) the file; b) the
telephone line; c) the system you're connected to; or d) your own
<A NAME="IDX70"></A>
<A NAME="IDX71"></A>
computer.
<P>
From time to time, you will likely see messages on the Net that
you want to save for later viewing -- a recipe, a particularly witty
remark, something you want to write your congressman about, whatever.
This is where screen capturing and logging come in.
<P>
When you tell your communications software to capture a screen, it
opens a file in your computer (usually in the same directory or folder
used by the software) and "dumps" an image of whatever happens to be
on your screen at the time.
<P>
Logging works a bit differently.  When you issue a logging
command, you tell the software to open a file (again, usually in the
same directory or folder as used by the software) and then give it a
name. Then, until you turn off the logging command, everything that
scrolls on your screen is copied into that file, sort of like
recording on videotape.  This is useful for capturing long documents
that scroll for several pages -- using screen capture, you would have
to repeat the same command for each new screen.
<P>
Terminal emulation is a way for your computer to mimic, or
emulate, the way other computers put information on the screen and
accept commands from a keyboard.  In general, most systems on the Net
use a system called VT100.  Fortunately, almost all communications
programs now on the market support this system as well -- make sure
yours does.
<P>
You'll also have to know about protocols.  There are several
different ways for computers to transmit characters.  Fortunately,
there are only two protocols that you're likely to run across: 8-1-N
(which stands for "8 bits, 1 stop bit, no parity" -- yikes!) and 7-1-E
<A NAME="IDX72"></A>
(7 bits, 1 stop bit, even parity).
<P>
In general, Unix-based systems use 7-1-E, while MS-DOS-based
systems use 8-1-N.  What if you don't know what kind of system you're
connecting to?  Try one of the settings.  If you get what looks like
gobbledygook when you connect, you may need the other setting.  
If so, you can either change the setting while connected, and then hit
enter, or hang up and try again with the other setting.  It's also
possible your modem and the modem at the other end can't agree on the
right bps rate.  If changing the protocols doesn't work, try using 
another bps rate (but no faster than the one listed for your modem). 
Don't worry, remember, you can't break anything!  If something looks wrong, 
it probably is wrong.  Change your settings and try again.  Nothing is
learned without trial, error and effort.
<A NAME="IDX73"></A>
Those are the basics. Now on to the Net!

<H2><A NAME="SEC12" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC12">Go!</A></H2>
<P>
Once, only people who studied or worked at an institution
directly tied to the Net could connect to the world.  Today, though,
an ever-growing number of "public-access" systems provide access for
everybody.  These systems can now be found in several states, and there
are a couple of sites that can provide access across the country.
<P>
There are two basic kinds of these host systems.  The more common
one is known as a UUCP site (UUCP being a common way to transfer
information among computers using the Unix operating system) and
<A NAME="IDX74"></A>
offers access to international electronic mail and conferences.
<P>
However, recent years have seen the growth of more powerful sites
that let you tap into the full power of the Net.  These Internet sites
not only give you access to electronic mail and conferences but to
such services as databases, libraries and huge file and program
collections around the world.  They are also fast -- as soon as you
<A NAME="IDX75"></A>
finish writing a message, it gets zapped out to its destination.
<P>
Some sites are run by for-profit companies; others by non-profit
organizations.  Some of these public-access, or host, systems, are
free of charge.  Others charge a monthly or yearly fee for unlimited
access.  And a few charge by the hour. Systems that charge for access 
will usually let you sign up online with a credit card.  Some also let 
<A NAME="IDX76"></A>
<A NAME="IDX77"></A>
<A NAME="IDX78"></A>
you set up a billing system. 
<P>
But cost should be only one consideration in choosing a host 
system, especially if you live in an area with more than one provider.  
Most systems let you look around before you sign up.  What is the range 
of each of their services?  How easy is each to use? What kind of support or 
help can you get from the system administrators? 
<P>
The last two questions are particularly important because many     
systems provide no user interface at all; when you connect, you are
dumped right into the Unix operating system.  If you're already
familiar with Unix, or you want to learn how to use it, these systems
offer phenomenal power -- in addition to Net access, most also let you
tap into the power of Unix to do everything from compiling your own
programs to playing online games.
<P>
But if you don't want to have to learn Unix, there are other
public-access systems that work through menus (just like the ones in
restaurants; you are shown a list of choices and then you make your
selection of what you want), or which provide a "user interface" that
is easier to figure out than the ever cryptic Unix.
<P>
If you don't want or need access to the full range of Internet
services, a UUCP site makes good financial sense.  They tend to charge
less than commercial Internet providers, although their messages may
<A NAME="IDX79"></A>
not go out as quickly.
<P>
Some systems also have their own unique local services, which can
range from extensive conferences to large file libraries.

<P>
When you have your communications program dial one of these host
systems, one of two things will happen when you connect.  You'll
either see a lot of gibberish on your screen, or you'll be asked to
log in.  If you see gibberish, chances are you have to change your
software's parameters (to 7-1-E or 8-1-N as the case may be).  Hang
up, make the change and then dial in again.
<P>
When you've connected, chances are you'll see something like
this:
<P>
<PRE>
Welcome to THE WORLD
Public Access UNIX for the '90s
Login as <SAMP>`new'</SAMP> if you do not have an account

login:
</PRE>
<P>
That last line is a prompt asking you to do something.  Since
this is your first call, type
<P>
<PRE>
new
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  Often, when you're asked to type something by a host
system, you'll be told what to type in quotation marks (for example,
<SAMP>`new'</SAMP> above).  Don't include the quotation marks.  Repeat: Don't
include the quotation marks.
<P>
What you see next depends on the system, but will generally
consist of information about its costs and services (you might want to
turn on your communication software's logging function, to save this
information).  You'll likely be asked if you want to establish an
account now or just look around the system.
<P>
You'll also likely be asked for your "user name."  This is not
your full name, but a one-word name you want to use while online.  It
can be any combination of letters or numbers, all in lower case.  Many
people use their first initial and last name (for example,
"jdoe"); their first name and the first letter of their last name
(for example, "johnd"); or their initials ("jxd").  Others use a
nickname.  You might want to think about this for a second, because this
user name will become part of your electronic-mail address
(see section <A HREF="bdg_44.html#SEC47">Electronic Mail</A>).  The one exception is the various Free-Net
systems, all of which assign you a user name consisting of an arbitrary
<A NAME="IDX80"></A>
sequence of letters and numbers.
<P>
You are now on the Net.  Look around the system.  See if there
are any help files for you to read.  If it's a menu-based host system, 
choose different options just to see what happens.  Remember: You can't 
break anything.  The more you play, the more comfortable you'll be. 
<P>
What follows is a list of public-access Internet sites, which are
computer systems that offer access to the Net.  All offer international
e-mail and Usenet (international conferences).  In addition, they offer:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX81"></A>
<A NAME="IDX82"></A>
<DT>FTP
<DD>File-transfer protocol -- access to hundreds of file
libraries (everything from computer software to historical
documents to song lyrics).  You'll be able to transfer
these files from the Net to your own computer.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX83"></A>
<A NAME="IDX84"></A>
<DT>Telnet
<DD>Access to databases, computerized library card
catalogs, weather reports and other information services,
as well as live, online games that let you compete with
players from around the world.
</DL>
<P>
Additional services that may be offered include:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX85"></A>
<DT>WAIS
<DD>Wide-area Information Server; a program that
can search dozens of databases in one search.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX86"></A>
<A NAME="IDX87"></A>
<DT>Gopher
<DD>A program that gives you easy access to dozens
of other online databases and services by making
selections on a menu. You'll also be able to use these
to copy text files and some programs to your mailbox.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX88"></A>
<A NAME="IDX89"></A>
<DT>IRC
<DD>Internet Relay Chat, a CB simulator that lets
you have live keyboard chats with people around the
world.
</DL>
<P>
However, even on systems that do not provide these services
directly, you will be able to use a number of them through telnet
(see section <A HREF="bdg_89.html#SEC92">Telnet (Mining the Net, part I)</A>). In the list that follows, 
systems that let you access services through menus are noted; otherwise 
assume that when you connect, you'll be dumped right into Unix (a.k.a. 
MS-DOS with a college degree). Several of these sites are available 
nationwide through national data networks such as the CompuServe Packet 
<A NAME="IDX90"></A>
<A NAME="IDX91"></A>
<A NAME="IDX92"></A>
Network and SprintNet. 
<P>
Please note that all listed charges are subject to change.  Many 
sites require new or prospective users to log on a particular way on 
their first call; this list provides the name you'll use in such cases.

<P>
If you don't live in an area with a public-access site, you'll still 
be able to connect to the Net.  Several services offer access 
through national data networks such as the CompuServe Packet Network and 
SprintNet, which have dozens, even hundreds of local dial-in numbers across 
the country.  These include Holonet in Berkeley, Calf., Portal in 
Cupertino, Calf., the WELL in Sausalito, Calf., Dial 'N CERF in San Diego, 
Calf., the World in Brookline, Mass., and Michnet in Ann Arbor, Mich.  Dial 
'N CERF offers access through an 800 number.  Expect to pay from $2 to $12 
an hour to use these networks, above each provider's basic charges.  The 
exact amount depends on the network, time of day and type of modem you use.  
<A NAME="IDX94"></A>
<A NAME="IDX95"></A>

<A NAME="IDX99"></A>
<A NAME="IDX100"></A>
<A NAME="IDX101"></A>
For more information, contact the above services. 
<P>
Four other providers deliver Net access to users across the 
country:
<P>
<B>Delphi</B>, based in Cambridge, Mass., is a consumer-oriented network
much like CompuServe or America On-Line -- only it now offers
<A NAME="IDX102"></A>
subscribers access to Internet services. 
<P>
Charges: $3 a month for Internet access, in addition to standard 
charges.  These are $10 a month for four hours of off-peak (non-working 
hours) access a month and $4 an hour for eachs additional hour or $20 for 
20 hours of access a month and $1.80 an hour for each additional hour.  
For more information, call (800) 695-4005.
<P>
<B>PSI</B>, based in Reston, Va., provides nationwide access to Internet
services through scores of local dial-in numbers to owners of IBM and
compatible computers.  PSILink. which includes access to e-mail,
Usenet and ftp, costs $29 a month, plus a one-time $19 registration
fee.  Special software is required, but is available free from PSI.
PSI's Global Dialup Service provides access to telnet for $39 a month
plus a one-time $39 set-up fee.  For more information, call (800)
<A NAME="IDX103"></A>
82PSI82 or (703) 620-6651.
<P>
<B>BIX</B> (the Byte Information Exchange) offers FTP, Telnet and e-mail
access to the Internet as part of their basic service. Owned by the same 
company as Delphi, it also offers 20 hours of access a month for $20.  
<A NAME="IDX104"></A>
<A NAME="IDX105"></A>
For more information, call (800) 695-4775.
<P>
<B>NovX Systems Integration</B>, based in Seattle, Washington, offers full 
Internet access through an 800 number reachable across the United States. 
There is a $24.95 setup fee, in addition to a monthly fee of $19.95 and a

<H2><A NAME="SEC43" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC43">Net Origins</A></H2>
<P>
In the 1960s, researchers began experimenting with linking
computers to each other and to people through telephone hook-ups,
using funds from the U.S Defense Department's Advanced Research
Projects Agency (ARPA).
<P>
ARPA wanted to see if computers in different locations could be
linked using a new technology known as packet switching, which had the
promise of letting several users share just one communications line.
Previous computer networking efforts had required a line between each
computer on the network, sort of like a train track on which only one
train can travel at a time.  The packet system allowed for creation of
a data highway, in which large numbers of vehicles could essentially
share the same lane.  Each packet was given the computer equivalent of
a map and a time stamp, so that it could be sent to the right
destination, where it would then be reassembled into a message the
<A NAME="IDX107"></A>
computer or a human could use.
<P>
This system allowed computers to share data and the researchers to
exchange electronic mail, or e-mail.  In itself, e-mail was something
of a revolution, offering the ability to send detailed letters at the
speed of a phone call.
<P>
As this system, known as ARPANet, grew, some enterprising college
students (and one in high school) developed a way to use it to conduct
online conferences.  These started as science-oriented discussions, but
they soon branched out into virtually every other field, as people
recognized the power of being able to "talk" to hundreds, or even 
<A NAME="IDX108"></A>
thousands, of people around the country.
<P>
In the 1970s, ARPA helped support the development of rules, or 
protocols, for transferring data between different types of computer 
networks.  These "internet" (from "internetworking") protocols made it 
possible to develop the worldwide Net we have today that links all sorts 
of computers across national boundaries. By the close of the 1970s, links 
developed between ARPANet and counterparts in other countries.  The world 
was now tied together in a computer web.
<P>
By the close of the 1970s, links developed between ARPANet and
counterparts in other countries.  The world was now tied together in a
computer web.
<P>
In the 1980s, this network of networks, which became known
collectively as the Internet, expanded at a phenomenal rate.  Hundreds,
then thousands, of colleges, research companies and government agencies
began to connect their computers to this worldwide Net.  Some
enterprising hobbyists and companies unwilling to pay the high costs of
Internet access (or unable to meet stringent government regulations for
access) learned how to link their own systems to the Internet, even if
"only" for e-mail and conferences.  Some of these systems began
offering access to the public. Now anybody with a computer and modem --
and persistence -- could tap into the world. 
<P>
In the 1990s, the Net grows at exponential rates.  Some estimates
are that the volume of messages transferred through the Net grows 20
percent a month.  In response, government and other users have tried in
recent years to expand the Net itself.  Once, the main Net "backbone" in
the U.S. moved data at 1.5 million bits per second.  That proved too
slow for the ever increasing amounts of data being sent over it, and in
recent years the maximum speed was increased to 1.5 million and then 45 
million bits per second. Even before the Net was able to reach that 
latter speed, however, Net experts were already figuring out ways to pump 
data at speeds of up to 2 billion bits per second -- fast enough to send 
the entire Encyclopedia Britannica across the country in just one or two 
seconds. 
<P>
Another major change has been the development of commercial 
services that provide internetworking services at speeds comparable to 
those of the government system.  In fact, by mid-1994, the U.S. 
government will remove itself from any day-to-day control over the 
workings of the Net, as regional and national providers continue to 
expand.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - How it Works</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_40.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_42.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC44" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC44">How it Works</A></H2>
<P>
The worldwide Net is actually a complex web of smaller regional
networks.  To understand it, picture a modern road network of
trans-continental superhighways connecting large cities.
From these large cities come smaller freeways and parkways to link together
small towns, whose residents travel on slower, narrow residential ways.  
<P>
The Net superhighway is the high-speed Internet.  Connected to
this are computers that use a particular system of transferring data
at high speeds.  In the U.S., the major Internet "backbone"
theoretically can move data at rates of 45 million bits per second
(compare this to the average home modem, which has a top speed of roughly
9,600 to 14,400 bits per second).  This internetworking "protocol" lets network users
<A NAME="IDX109"></A>
<A NAME="IDX110"></A>
connect to computers around the world.
<P>
Connected to the backbone computers are smaller networks serving 
particular geographic regions, which generally move data at speeds 
around 1.5 million bits per second.
<P>
Feeding off these in turn are even smaller networks or individual 
computers.
<P>
Unlike commercial networks such as CompuServe or Prodigy,
<A NAME="IDX111"></A>
<A NAME="IDX112"></A>
the Internet is not run by one central computer or computers.
This is both its greatest strength and its greatest weakness.   The approach 
means it is virtually impossible for the entire Net to crash at once -- 
even if one computer shuts down, the rest of the network stays up.  The 
design also reduces the costs for an individual or organization to get 
onto the network.  But thousands of connected computers can also make it 
difficult to navigate the Net and find what you want -- especially as 
different computers may have different commands for plumbing their 
resources.  It is only recently that Net users have begun to develop the 
sorts of navigational tools and "maps" that will let neophytes get around 
without getting lost. 
<P>
Nobody really knows how many computers and networks actually make
up this Net.  Some estimates say there are now as many as 5,000
networks connecting nearly 2 million computers and more than 15 million 
people around the world.  Whatever the actual numbers, however, it is 
clear they are only increasing.
<P>
The Net is more than just a technological marvel. It is human
communication at its most fundamental level.  The pace may be a little
quicker when the messages race around the world in a few seconds, but
it's not much different from a large and interesting party. You'll see
things in cyberspace that will make you laugh; you'll see things that
will anger you.  You'll read silly little snippets and new ideas that
make you think.  You'll make new friends and meet people you wish would
just go away.
<P>
Major network providers continue to work on ways to make it
easier for users of one network to communicate with those of another.  
Work is underway on a system for providing a universal "white pages"
in which you could look up somebody's electronic-mail address, for
example.  This connectivity trend will likely speed up in coming years
as users begin to demand seamless network access, much as telephone
users can now dial almost anywhere in the world without worrying about
<A NAME="IDX113"></A>
<A NAME="IDX114"></A>
how many phone companies actually have to connect their calls.
<P>
And today, the links grow ever closer between the Internet and such 
commercial networks as CompuServe and Prodigy, whose users can now 
exchange electronic mail with their Internet friends.  Some commercial 
providers, such as Delphi and America Online, are working to bring their 
<A NAME="IDX115"></A>
<A NAME="IDX116"></A>
subscribers direct access to Internet services.
<P>
And as it becomes easier to use, more and more people will join
this worldwide community we call the Net.
<P>
Being connected to the Net takes more than just reading
conferences and logging messages to your computer; it takes asking and
answering questions, exchanging opinions -- getting involved.
<P>
If you choose to go forward, to use and contribute, you will become
a "citizen of Cyberspace."  If you're reading these words for the first 
time, this may seem like an amusing but unlikely notion -- that one
could "inhabit" a place without physical space.  But put a mark beside 
these words.  Join the Net and actively participate for a year.  Then
re-read this passage.  It will no longer seem so strange to be a
"citizen of Cyberspace."  It will seem like the most natural thing in
the world.
<P>
And that leads to a fundamental thing to remember:
<P>
<B>You can't break the Net!</B>
<P>
As you travel the Net, your computer may freeze, your screen may
erupt into a mass of gibberish.  You may think you've just disabled a
million-dollar computer somewhere -- or even your own personal
computer.  Sooner or later, this feeling happens to everyone -- and
likely more than once. But the Net and your computer are hardier than
you think, so relax.  You can no more break the Net than you can the
phone system.  If something goes wrong, try again.  If nothing at all 
happens, you can always disconnect.   If worse comes to worse, you can 
turn off your computer.  Then take a deep breath.  And dial right back 
in. Leave a note for the person who runs the computer to which you've 
connected to ask for advice.  Try it again. Persistence pays.  
<P>
Stay and contribute.  The Net will be richer for it -- and so will 
you.

Your computer connects with a public-access site and get
gibberish on your screen.  If you are using parameters of 8-1-N, try
7-1-e (or vice-versa).  If that doesn't work, try another modem speed.
<P>

You have your computer dial a public-access site, but nothing
happens.  Check the phone number you typed in.  If correct, turn on your
modem's speaker (on Hayes-compatible modems, you can usually do this by
typing ATM1 in your communications software's "terminal mode").  If the
phone just rings and rings, the public-access site could be down for
maintenance or due to a crash or some other problem.  If you get a
"connect" message, but nothing else, try hitting enter or escape a

You try to log in, but after you type your password, nothing

The Net grows so fast that even the best guide to its resources 
would be somewhat outdated the day it was printed.  At the end of each 
chapter, however, you'll find FYI pointers to places on the Net where you 
can go for more information or to keep updated on new resources and 
services.

<VAR>Peter Kaminski</VAR> maintains a list of systems that provide public access to 
Internet services.  It's availble on the network itself, which obviously 
does you little good if you currently have no access, but which can 
prove invaluable should you move or want to find a new system.  Look for

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - The Basics</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_44.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_46.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC48" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC48">The Basics</A></H2>
Electronic mail, or e-mail, is your personal connection to the
<A NAME="IDX123"></A>
<A NAME="IDX124"></A>
world of the Net.
<P>
All of the millions of people around the world who use the 
Net have their own e-mail addresses.  A growing number of "gateways" tie 
more and more people to the Net every day.  When you logged onto the host 
system you are now using, it automatically generated an address for you, 
<A NAME="IDX125"></A>
as well. 
<P>
The basic concepts behind e-mail parallel those of regular mail.
You send mail to people at their particular addresses.  In turn, they
write to you at your e-mail address.  You can subscribe to the 
electronic equivalent of magazines and newspapers. You might even get 
<A NAME="IDX126"></A>
electronic junk mail.
<P>
E-mail has two distinct advantages over regular mail.  The most 
obvious is speed. Instead of several days, your message can reach the 
other side of the world in hours, minutes or even seconds (depending on 
where you drop off your mail and the state of the connections between
there and your recipient).  The other advantage is that once you master
the basics, you'll be able to use e-mail to access databases and file
libraries.  You'll see how to do this later, along with learning how to
transfer program and data files through e-mail.
<P>
E-mail also has advantages over the telephone.  You send your
message when it's convenient for you.  Your recipients respond at their 
convenience.  No more telephone tag.  And while a phone call across
the country or around the world can quickly result in huge phone
bills, e-mail lets you exchange vast amounts of mail for only a few
pennies -- even if the other person is in New Zealand.
<P>
E-mail is your connection to help -- your Net lifeline.  The
Net can sometimes seem a frustrating place!  No matter how hard you
try, no matter where you look, you just might not be able to find the
answer to whatever is causing you problems. But when you know how to
use e-mail, help is often just a few keystrokes away: you can ask your 
system administrator or a friend for help in an e-mail message.
<P>
The quickest way to start learning e-mail is to send yourself a
message.  Most public-access sites actually have several different types 
of mail systems, all of which let you both send and receive mail. We'll 
start with the simplest one, known, appropriately enough, as "mail," and 
then look at a couple of other interfaces. At your host system's command 
prompt, type: 
<P>
<PRE>
mail username
</PRE>
<P>
where username is the name you gave yourself when you first logged on.
Hit enter.  The computer might respond with
<P>
<PRE>
Subject:
</PRE>
<P>
Type
<P>
<PRE>
test
</PRE>
<P>
or, actually, anything at all (but you'll have to hit enter before
you get to the end of the screen). Hit enter.
<P>
The cursor will drop down a line. You can now begin writing the
actual message. Type a sentence, again, anything at all.  And here's
where you hit your first Unix frustration, one that will bug you
repeatedly: you have to hit enter before you get to the very end of
the line.  Just like typewriters, many Unix programs have no
word-wrapping.<A NAME="FOOT2" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT2">(2)</A>
<P>
When done with your message, hit return. Now hit control-D (the
control and the D keys at the same time).  This is a Unix command that
tells the computer you're done writing and that it should close your
"envelope" and mail it off (you could also hit enter once and then, on
a blank line, type a period at the beginning of the line and hit enter
again).
<P>
You've just sent your first e-mail message.  And because you're
sending mail to yourself, rather than to someone somewhere else on the
Net, your message has already arrived, as we'll see in a moment.
<P>
If you had wanted, you could have even written your message on
your own computer and then uploaded it into this electronic
"envelope."  There are a couple of good reasons to do this with long
or involved messages.  One is that once you hit enter at the end of a
line in "mail" you can't readily fix any mistakes on that line (unless
you use some special commands to call up a Unix text processor).  Also,
if you are paying for access by the hour, uploading a prepared
message can save you money.  Remember to save the document in ASCII or
text format.  Uploading a document you've created in a word processor
that uses special formatting commands (which these days means many
programs) will cause strange effects.
<P>
When you get that blank line after the subject line, upload the
message using the ASCII protocol.  Or you can copy and paste the text,
if your software allows that. When done, hit control-D as above.
<P>
Now you have mail waiting for you.  Normally, when you log on,
your public-access site will tell you whether you have new mail
waiting.  To open your mailbox and see your waiting mail, type
<P>
<PRE>
mail
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.
<P>
When the host system sees "mail" without a name after it, it
knows you want to look in your mailbox rather than send a message.
Your screen, on a plain-vanilla Unix system will display:
<P>
<PRE>
Mail version SMI 4.0 Mon Apr 24 18:34:15 PDT 1989  Type ? for help.
"/usr/spool/mail/adamg": 1 message 1 new 1 unread

&#62;N 1 adamg              Sat Jan 15 20:04   12/290   test
</PRE>
<P>
Ignore the first line; it's just computerese of value only to the
people who run your system. You can type a question mark and hit
return, but unless you're familiar with Unix, most of what you'll see
won't make much sense at this point.
<P>
The second line tells you the directory on the host system where
your mail messages are put, which again, is not something you'll likely 
need to know.  The second line also tells you how many messages are in your 
mailbox, how many have come in since the last time you looked and how
many messages you haven't read yet.
<P>
It's the third line that is of real interest -- it tells you who
the message is from, when it arrived, how many lines and characters
it takes up, and what the subject is.  The "N" means it is a new
message -- it arrived after the last time you looked in your mailbox.
Hit enter. And there's your message -- only now it's a lot
longer than what you wrote!
<P>
<PRE>
Message 1:
From adamg Jan 15 20:04:55 1994
Received: by eff.org id AA28949

To: adamg
Subject: test
Status: R

This is only a test!
</PRE>
<P>
Whoa! What is all that stuff? It's your message with a postmark
gone mad.  Just as the postal service puts its marks on every piece of
mail it handles, so do Net postal systems.  Only it's called a
"header" instead of a postmark. Each system that handles or routes
your mail puts its stamp on it.  Since many messages go through a
number of systems on their way to you, you will often get messages
with headers that seem to go on forever.  Among other things, a header
will tell you exactly when a message was sent and received (even the
difference between your local time and Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) --
as at the end of line 4 above).
<P>
If this had been a long message, it would just keep scrolling
across and down your screen -- unless the people who run your
public-access site have set it up to pause every 24 lines.  One way to deal
with a message that doesn't stop is to use your telecommunication
software's logging or text-buffer function.  Start it before you hit
the number of the message you want to see.  Your computer will ask you
what you want to call the file you're about to create. After you name
the file and hit enter, type the number of the message you want to see
and hit enter.  When the message finishes scrolling, turn off the
text-buffer function. The message is now saved in your computer.  
This way, you can read the message while not connected to the Net
(which can save you money if you're paying by the hour) and write a
reply offline.
<P>
But in the meantime, now what?  You can respond to the message,
delete it or save it.  To respond, type a lowercase "r" and hit
enter.  You'll get something like this:
<P>
<PRE>
To: adamg
Subject: Re: test
</PRE>
<P>
Note that this time, you don't have to enter a user name.  The 
computer takes it from the message you're replying to and
automatically addresses your message to its sender. The computer also
automatically inserts a subject line, by adding "Re:" to the original 
subject.  From here, it's just like writing a new message. But say you
change your mind and decide not to reply after all. How do you get out
of the message? Hit control-C once. You'll get this:
<P>
<PRE>
(Interrupt -- one more to kill letter)
</PRE>
<P>
If you hit control-C once more, the message will disappear and you'll
get back to your mail's command line.
<P>
Now, if you type a lowercase "d" and then hit enter, you'll
delete the original message.  Type a lowercase "q" to exit your
mailbox.
<P>
If you type a "q" without first hitting "d", your message is
transferred to a file called mbox.  This file is where all read, but
un-deleted messages go.  If you want to leave it in your mailbox for
now, type a lowercase "x" and hit enter.  This gets you out of mail
without making any changes.
<P>
The mbox file works a lot like your mailbox.  To access it, type
<P>
<PRE>
mail -f mbox
</PRE>
<P>
at your host system's command line and hit enter.
<P>
You'll get a menu identical to the one in your mailbox from which
you can read these old messages, delete them or respond to them.  It's
probably a good idea to clear out your mailbox and mbox file from
time to time, if only to keep them uncluttered.
<P>
Are there any drawbacks to e-mail?  There are a few.  One is that
people seem more willing to fly off the handle electronically than in
person, or over the phone.  Maybe it's because it's so easy to hit R
and reply to a message without pausing and reflecting a moment.
That's why we have smileys (see section <A HREF="bdg_48.html#SEC51">Smileys</A>)!  There's no online 
equivalent yet of a return receipt: chances are your message got to where 
it's going, but there's no absolute way for you to know for sure unless 
you get a reply from the other person.                
<P>
So now you're ready to send e-mail to other people on the Net.
Of course, you need somebody's address to send them mail.  How do you
get it?
<P>
Alas, the simplest answer is not what you'd call the most
elegant: you call them up on the phone or write them a letter on paper
and ask them.  Residents of the electronic frontier are only beginning
to develop the equivalent of phone books, and the ones that exist
today are far from complete (still, later on, see section <A HREF="bdg_89.html#SEC92">Telnet (Mining the Net, part I)</A>,
we'll show you how to use some of these directories).
<P>
Eventually, you'll start corresponding with people, which means
you'll want to know how to address mail to them.  It's vital to know
how to do this, because the smallest mistake -- using a comma when you
should have used a period, for instance, can bounce the message back
to you, undelivered.  In this sense, Net addresses are like phone
numbers: one wrong digit and you get the wrong person.  Fortunately,
most net addresses now adhere to a relatively easy-to-understand
system.
<P>
Earlier, you sent yourself a mail message using just your
user-name.  This was sort of like making a local phone call -- you didn't
have to dial a 1 or an area code.  This also works for mail to anybody
else who has an account on the same system as you.
<P>
Sending mail outside of your system, though, will require the use
of the Net equivalent of area codes, called "domains." A basic Net
address will look something like this:
<P>
<PRE>
tomg@world.std.com
</PRE>
<P>
Tomg is somebody's user ID, and he is at (hence the  sign) a site 
(or in Internetese, a "domain") known as <SAMP>`std.com'</SAMP>.  Large organizations 
often have more than one computer linked to the Internet; in this case, 
the name of the particular machine is world (you will quickly notice 
that, like boat owners, Internet computer owners always name their 
machines). 
<P>
Domains tell you the name of the organization that runs a given
e-mail site and what kind of site it is or, if it's not in the U.S.,
what country it's located in.  Large organizations may have more than
one computer or gateway tied to the Internet, so you'll often see a
two-part domain name; and sometimes even three- or four-part domain
names.
<P>
In general, American addresses end in an organizational suffix,
such as ".edu," which means the site is at a college or university.
Other American suffixes include:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>.com</CODE>
<DD>for businesses
<P>
<DT><CODE>.org</CODE>
<DD>for non-profit organizations
<P>
<DT><CODE>.gov</CODE>
<DD><DT><CODE>.mil</CODE>
<DD>for government and military agencies
<P>
<DT><CODE>.net</CODE>
<DD>for companies or organizations that run large networks.
</DL>
<P>
Sites in the rest of the world tend to use a two-letter code that
represents their country.  Most make sense, such as <SAMP>`.ca'</SAMP> for Canadian
sites, but there are a couple of seemingly odd ones, at least if
you don't know the ISO 3166 standard international abbreviations.
(see section <A HREF="bdg_279.html#SEC282">Internet Country Codes</A> for a list of the rest of the world.)
E.g., swiss sites end in <SAMP>`.ch'</SAMP> (Confederatio Helvetica),
German sites end in <SAMP>`.de'</SAMP> (DEutschland),
while South African ones end in <SAMP>`.za'</SAMP> (from the archaic spelling
Zuid Afrika).
Some U.S. sites have followed this international convention
(such as well.sf.ca.us).
<P>
You'll notice that the above addresses are all in lowercase.
Unlike almost everything else having anything at all to do with Unix,
most Net mailing systems don't care about case, so you generally don't 
have to worry about capitalizing e-mail addresses.  Alas, there are a few 
exceptions -- some public-access sites do allow for capital letters in 
user names.  When in doubt, ask the person you want to write to, or let 
her send you a message first (recall how a person's e-mail address is 
usually found on the top of her message). The domain name, the part of the 
address after the @ sign, never has to be capitalized.               
<P>
It's all a fairly simple system that works very well, except,
again, it's vital to get the address exactly right -- just as you have
to dial a phone number exactly right.  Send a message to <CODE>tomg@unm.edu</CODE>
(which is the University of New Mexico) when you meant to send it to
<CODE>tomg@umn.edu</CODE> (the University of Minnesota), and your letter will either
bounce back to you undelivered, or go to the wrong person.
<P>
If your message is bounced back to you as undeliverable, you'll
get an ominous looking-message from MAILER-DAEMON (actually a rather
benign Unix program that exists to handle mail), with an evil-looking
header followed by the text of your message. Sometimes, you can tell
what went wrong by looking at the first few lines of the bounced
message.  Besides an incorrect address, it's possible your host system
does not have the other site in the "map" it maintains of other host
systems. Or you could be trying to send mail to another network, such
as Bitnet or CompuServe, that has special addressing requirements.
<P>
Sometimes, figuring all this out can prove highly frustrating.
But remember the prime Net commandment: Ask.  Send a message to your
system administrator.  He or she might be able to help decipher the
problem.
<P>
There is one kind of address that may give your host system
particular problems.  There are two main ways that Unix systems
exchange mail.  One is known as UUCP and started out with a different
addressing system than the rest of the Net.  Most UUCP systems have
since switched over to the standard Net addressing system, but a few
traditional sites still cling to their original type, which tends to
have lots of exclamation points in it, like this:
<P>
<PRE>
uunet!somesite!othersite!mybuddy
</PRE>
<P>
The problem for many host sites is that exclamation points (also
known as "bangs") now mean something special in the more common systems 
or "shells" used to operate many Unix computers. This means that 
addressing mail to such a site (or even responding to a message you 
received from one) could confuse the poor computer to no end and your 
message never gets sent out. If that happens, try putting backslashes in 
front of each exclamation point, so that you get an address that looks 
like this: 
<P>
<PRE>
uunet\!somesite\!othersite\!mybuddy
</PRE>
<P>
Note that this means you may not be able to respond to such a message
by typing a lowercase <SAMP>`r'</SAMP>  -- you may get an error message and you'll 
have to create a brand-new message. 
<P>
If you want to get a taste of what's possible through e-mail,
start an e-mail message to
<P>
<PRE>
almanac@oes.orst.edu
</PRE>
<P>
Leave the "Subject:" line blank.  As a message, write this:
<P>
<PRE>
send quote
</PRE>
<P>
Or, if you're feeling a little down, write this instead:
<P>
<PRE>
send moral-support
</PRE>
<P>
In either case, you will get back a message within a few seconds to
a few hours (depending on the state of your host system's Internet
connection).  If you simply asked for a quote, you'll get back a
fortune-cookie-like saying.  If you asked for moral support, you'll also
<A NAME="IDX127"></A>
get back a fortune-cookie-like saying, only supposedly more uplifting.
<P>
This particular "mail server" is run by Oregon State University.
Its main purpose is actually to provide a way to distribute agricultural
information via e-mail.  If you'd like to find out how to use the
server's full range of services, send a message to its address with this 
line in it: 
<P>
<PRE>
send help
</PRE>
<P>
You'll quickly get back a lengthy document detailing just what's
available and how to get it.
<P>
Feeling opinionated?  Want to give the President of the United States
a piece of your mind?  Send a message to <TT>&lt;president@whitehouse.gov&gt;</TT>.
<A NAME="IDX128"></A>
<A NAME="IDX129"></A>
Or if the vice president will do, write <TT>&lt;vice-president@whitehouse.gov&gt;</TT>.
<P>
The "mail" program is actually a very powerful one and a Netwide
standard, at least on Unix computers.  But it can be hard to figure
out -- you can type a question mark to get a list of commands, but
these may be of limited use unless you're already familiar with Unix.
Fortunately, there are a couple of other mail programs that are easier
to use.

<P>
Elm is a combination mailbox and letter-writing system that uses
menus to help you navigate through mail.  Most Unix-based host systems
<A NAME="IDX130"></A>
now have it online. To use it, type
<P>
<PRE>
elm
<A NAME="IDX131"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  You'll get a menu of your waiting mail, along with a
list of commands you can execute, that will look something like this:
<P>
<PRE>
Mailbox is '/usr/spool/mail/adamg' with 38 messages [ELM 2.3 PL11]

You can use any of the following commands by pressing the first character;
d)elete or u)ndelete mail, m)ail a message, r)eply or f)orward mail, q)uit
To read a message, press &#60;return&#62;. j = move down, k = move up, ? = help
<A NAME="IDX132"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
Each line shows the date you received the message, who sent it,
how many lines long the message is, and the message's subject.
<P>
If you are using VT100 emulation, you can move up and down the
menu with your up and down arrow keys.  Otherwise, type the line number
of the message you want to read or delete and hit enter.
<P>
When you read a message, it pauses every 24 lines, instead of
scrolling until it's done.  Hit the space bar to read the next page.
You can type a lowercase "r" to reply or a lowercase "q" or "i"
to get back to the menu (the I stands for "index").
<P>
At the main menu, hitting a lowercase "m" followed by enter
will let you start a message.  To delete a message, type a lowercase
"d".  You can do this while reading the message.  Or, if you are in
the menu, move the cursor to the message's line and then hit D.
<P>
When you're done with Elm, type a lowercase "q".  The program
will ask if you really want to delete the messages you marked. Then,
it will ask you if you want to move any messages you've read but
haven't marked for deletion to a "received" file.  For now, hit your
"n" key.
<P>
Elm has a major disadvantage for the beginner. The default text
editor it generally calls up when you hit your "r" or "m" key is
often a program called emacs. Unixoids swear by emacs, but everybody
else almost always finds it impossible.  Unfortunately, you can't
always get away from it (or vi, another text editor often found on
Unix systems), so later on we'll talk about some basic commands that
<A NAME="IDX133"></A>
<A NAME="IDX134"></A>
will keep you from going totally nuts.
<P>
If you want to save a message to your own computer, hit "s", either 
within the message or with your cursor on the message entry in the elm 
menu.  A filename will pop up.  If you do not like it, type a new name 
(you won't have to backspace).  Hit enter, and the message will be saved 
with that file name in your "home directory" on your host system.  After 
you exit elm, you can now download it (ask your system administrator for 
specifics on how to download -- and upload -- such files).

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - PINE</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_46.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_48.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC50" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC50">PINE -- An even better way</A></H2>
<P>
Pine is based on elm but includes a number of improvements that
make it an ideal mail system for beginners.   Like elm, pine starts
you with a menu.  It also has an "address book" feature that is handy
for people with long or complex e-mail addresses. Hitting A at the
main menu puts you in the address book, where you can type in the
person's first name (or nickname) followed by her address. Then, when
you want to send that person a message, you only have to type in her
first name or nickname, and pine automatically inserts her actual
address. The address book also lets you set up a mailing list.  This
feature allows you to send the same message to a number of people at
<A NAME="IDX135"></A>
once.
<P>
What really sets pine apart is its built-in text editor,
which looks and feels a lot more like word-processing programs
available for MS-DOS and Macintosh users.  Not only does it have
word wrap (a revolutionary concept if ever there was one), it also has a 
rwspell-checker and a search command. Best of all, all of the commands
you need are listed in a two-line mini-menu at the bottom of each
screen.  The commands look like this:
<P>
<PRE>
^W Where is
</PRE>
<P>
The little caret is a synonym for the key marked "control" on your
keyboard.  To find where a particular word is in your document, you'd
hit your control key and your W key at the same time, which would bring
up a prompt asking you for the word to look for.
<P>
Some of pine's commands are a tad peculiar (control-V for "page
down" for example), which comes from being based on a variant of
emacs (which is utterly peculiar).  But again, all of the commands you
need are listed on that two-line mini-menu, so it shouldn't take you
more than a couple of seconds to find the right one.
<P>
To use pine, type
<P>
<PRE>
pine
<A NAME="IDX136"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
at the command line and hit enter.  It's a relatively new program, so
many systems may not yet have it online.  But it's so easy to use, you
should probably send e-mail to your system administrator urging him to
get it!

<H2><A NAME="SEC51" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC51">Smileys</A></H2>
<P>
When you're involved in an online discussion, you can't see the
smiles or shrugs that the other person might make in a live
conversation to show he's only kidding.  But online, there's no body
language. So what you might think is funny, somebody else might take as
an insult.  To try to keep such misunderstandings from erupting into
bitter disputes, we have smileys.  Tilt your head to the left and look at
the following sideways. <CODE>:-)</CODE>.  Or simply <CODE>:)</CODE>.
This is your basic "smiley."
Use it to indicate people should not take that comment you just made as
seriously as they might otherwise.  You make a smiley by typing a colon,
a hyphen and a right parenthetical bracket. Some people prefer using the
<A NAME="IDX137"></A>
<A NAME="IDX138"></A>
word "grin," usually in this form:
<P>
<PRE>
&#60;grin&#62;
</PRE>
<P>
Sometimes, though, you'll see it as *grin* or even just &#60;g&#62; for short.
Some other smileys include:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>;-)</CODE>
<DD>Wink;
<P>
<DT><CODE>:-(</CODE>
<DD>Frown;
<P>
<DT><CODE>:-O</CODE>
<DD>Surprise;
<P>
<DT><CODE>8-)</CODE>
<DD>Wearing glasses;
<P>
<DT><CODE>=|:-)=</CODE>
<DD>Abe Lincoln.
</DL>
<P>
OK, so maybe the last two are a little bogus <CODE>:-)</CODE>, but for some
really fancy ones, see section <A HREF="bdg_290.html#SEC293">The Unofficial Smiley Dictionary</A>.

Users of Bitnet (and NetNorth in Canada and EARN in Europe) often 
have addresses in this form: <TT>&lt;IZZY@INDVMS&gt;</TT>.  If you're lucky, all you'll 
have to do to mail to that address is add "bitnet" at the end, to get 
<TT>&lt;izzy@indvms.bitnet&gt;</TT>.  Sometimes, however, mail to such an address will 
bounce back to you, because Bitnet addresses do not always translate 
well into an Internet form.  If this happens, you can send mail 
through one of two Internet/Bitnet gateways. First, change the <SAMP>`@'</SAMP> in 
the address to a <SAMP>`%'</SAMP>, so that you get <TT>&lt;user%site.bitnet&gt;</TT>.  Then add 
either <SAMP>`@vm.marist.edu'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`@cunyvm.cuny.edu'</SAMP>, so that, with the above 
example, you would get <TT>&lt;izzy%indyvms.bitnet@vm.marist.edu&gt;</TT> or 
<TT>&lt;izzy%indvyvms.bitnet@cunyvm.cuny.edu&gt;</TT>
<P>
Bitnet users have it a little easier: They can usually send mail 
directly to your e-mail address without fooling around with it at all.  
So send them your address and they should be OK.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Fidonet</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_54.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_56.html">next</A> section.<P>
<A NAME="IDX144"></A>
<H3><A NAME="SEC58" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC58">Fidonet</A></H3>
To send mail to people using a Fidonet BBS, you need the name 
they use to log onto that system and its "node number."  Fidonet node 
numbers or addresses consist of three numbers, in this form: 
<SAMP>`1:322/190'</SAMP>.  The first number tells which of several broad geographic 
zones the BBS is in (1 represents the U.S. and Canada, 2 Europe and 
Israel, 3 Pacific Asia, 4 South America).  The second number 
represents the BBS's network, while the final number is the BBS's 
"FidoNode" number in that network. If your correspondent only gives 
you two numbers (for example, <SAMP>`322/190'</SAMP>), it means the system is
in zone 1.   
<P>
Now comes the tricky part. You have to reverse the numbers and 
add to them the letters <SAMP>`f'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`n'</SAMP> and <SAMP>`z'</SAMP> (which stand for 
"FidoNode," "network," and "zone'). For example, the address above 
would become 
<P>
<PRE>
f190.n322.
</PRE>
<P>
Now add <SAMP>`fidonet.org'</SAMP> at the end, to get 
<SAMP>`f190.n322. z1.fidonet.org'</SAMP>.<A NAME="FOOT3" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT3">(3)</A>
Then add <SAMP>`First Name.LastName@'</SAMP>, to get 
<P>
<PRE>
FirstName.LastName@f190.n322.z1.fidonet.org. 
</PRE>
<P>
Note the period between the first and last names. 
Whew! 
<P>
The reverse process is totally different. First, the person has 
to have access to his or her BBS's "net mail" area and know the 
Fidonet address of his or her local Fidonet/UUCP gateway (often their 
system operator will know it).  Your Fidonet correspondent should 
address a net-mail message to UUCP (not your name) in the "to:" field.  
In the node-number field, they should type in the node number of the 
Fidonet/UUCP gateway (if the gateway system is in the same regional 
network as their system, they need only type the last number, for 
example, <SAMP>`390'</SAMP> instead of <SAMP>`322/390'</SAMP>).
Then, the first line of the message 
has to be your Internet address, followed by a blank line.  After 
that, the person can write the message and send it.  
<P>
Because of the way Fidonet moves mail, it could take a day or two 
for a message to be delivered in either direction.  Also, because many 
Fidonet systems are run as hobbies, it is considered good form to ask 
the gateway sysop's permission if you intend to pass large amounts of 
mail back and forth. Messages of a commercial nature are strictly 
forbidden (even if it's something the other person asked for). Also, 
consider it very likely that somebody other than the recipient will 
read your messages.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Seven UNIX Commands</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_59.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_61.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC63" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC63">Seven UNIX Commands you can't live without:</A></H2>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="bdg_61.html#SEC64">Wildcards</A>
</UL>
<P>
If you connect to the Net through a Unix system, eventually you'll
have to come to terms with Unix.  For better or worse, most Unix systems do
NOT shield you from their inner workings -- if you want to copy a Usenet
posting to a file, for example, you'll have to use some Unix commands if
you ever want to do anything with that file.
<P>
Like MS-DOS, Unix is an operating system - it tells the computer how
to do things.  Now while Unix may have a reputation as being even more
complex than MS-DOS, in most cases, a few basic, and simple, commands
should be all you'll ever need.
<P>
If your own computer uses MS-DOS or PC-DOS, the basic concepts will
seem very familiar -- but watch out for the cd command, which works
differently enough from the similarly named DOS command that it will drive
you crazy.  Also, unlike MS-DOS, Unix is case sensitive -- if you type
commands or directory names in the wrong case, you'll get an error message.
<P>
If you're used to working on a Mac, you'll have to remember that Unix
stores files in "directories" rather than "folders."  Unix directories are
organized like branches on a tree. At the bottom is the "root" directory,
with sub-directories branching off that (and sub-directories in turn can
have sub-directories). The Mac equivalent of a Unix sub-directory is a
folder within another folder.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX149"></A>
<DT><CODE>cat</CODE>
<DD>Equivalent to the MS-DOS "type" command.  To pause a file
every screen, type <SAMP>`cat file |more'</SAMP>, better: <SAMP>`more file'</SAMP>,
where "file" is the name of the file you want to see.
Hitting control-C will stop the display.  You can also use
<SAMP>`cat'</SAMP> for writing or uploading text files to your name or home
directory (similar to the MS-DOS <SAMP>`copy con:'</SAMP> command).  If you
type <SAMP>`cat &#62;test'</SAMP>
you start a file called "test".  You can either write
something simple (no editing once you've finished a line and
you have to hit return at the end of each line) or upload
something into that file using your communications software's
ASCII protocol).  To close the file, hit control-D.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX150"></A>
<DT><CODE>cd</CODE>
<DD>The "change directory" command.  To change from your present
directory to another, type <SAMP>`cd directory'</SAMP>
and hit enter. Unlike MS-DOS, which uses a \ to denote sub-directories
(for example: stuff\text), Unix uses a / (for
example: stuff/text).  So to change from your present
directory to the stuff/text sub-directory,  you would type
<SAMP>`cd stuff/text'</SAMP>
and then hit enter. As in MS-DOS, you do not need the first
backslash if the subdirectory comes off the directory you're
already in.  To move back up a directory tree, you would type
<SAMP>`cd ..'</SAMP>
followed by enter. Note the space between the <CODE>cd</CODE> and the two
periods -- this is where MS-DOS users will really go nuts.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX151"></A>
<DT><CODE>cp</CODE>
<DD>Copies a file. The syntax is
<SAMP>`cp file1 file2'</SAMP>
which would copy file1 to file2 (or overwrite file2 with
file1).
<P>
<A NAME="IDX152"></A>
<DT><CODE>ls</CODE>
<DD>This command, when followed by enter, tells you what's in the
directory, similar to the DOS <CODE>dir</CODE> command, except in
alphabetical order.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX153"></A>
<DT><CODE>ls |more</CODE>
<DD>will stop the listing every 24 lines -- handy if there are a
lot of things in the directory. The basic ls command does not
list "hidden" files, such as the <TT>`.login'</TT> file that controls
how your system interacts with Unix. To see these files, type
<SAMP>`ls -a'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`ls -a |more'</SAMP>
<P>
<SAMP>`ls -l'</SAMP> will tell you the size of each file in bytes and tell
you when each was created or modified.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX154"></A>
<DT><CODE>mv</CODE>
<DD>Similar to the MS-DOS rename command. In fact,
<SAMP>`mv file1 file2'</SAMP>
will rename file1 as file2, The command can 
also be used to move files between directories.
<P>
<SAMP>`mv file1 News'</SAMP>
would move file1 to your News directory.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX155"></A>
<DT><CODE>rm</CODE>
<DD>Deletes a file.  Type
<SAMP>`rm filename'</SAMP>
and hit enter (but beware: when you hit enter, it's gone for
good).

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - When things go wrong II</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_61.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_63.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC65" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC65">When things go wrong:</A></H2>
<UL>
<LI>
You send a message but get back an ominous looking message from
MAILER-DAEMON containing up to several dozen lines of computerese
followed by your message.
<P>
Somewhere in those lines you can often find a clue to what went 
wrong.  You might have made a mistake in spelling the e-mail address.  
The site to which you're sending mail might have been down for 
maintenance or a problem. You may have used the wrong "translation" for 
mail to a non-Internet network. 
<P>
<LI>
You call up your host system's text editor to write a message or
reply to one and can't seem to get out.
<P>
If it's emacs, try control-X, control-C (in other words, hit your
control key and your X key at the same time, followed by control and C).
If worse comes to worse, you can hang up.
<P>
<LI>
In Elm, you accidentally hit the D key for a message you want to
save.  Type the number of the message, hit enter and then U, which will
"un-delete" the message.  This works only before you exit Elm; once you
quit, the message is gone.
<P>
<LI>
You try to upload an ASCII message you've written on your own
computer into a message you're preparing in Elm or Pine and you get a
lot of left brackets, capital Ms, Ks and Ls and some funny-looking
characters.
<P>
Believe it or not, your message will actually wind up looking
fine; all that garbage is temporary and reflects the problems some Unix
text processors have with ASCII uploads.  But it will take much longer
for your upload to finish.  One way to deal with this is to call up the
simple mail program, which will not produce any weird characters when you
upload a text file into a message.  Another way (which is better if your
prepared message is a response to somebody's mail), is to create a text
file on your host system with cat, for example,
<P>
<PRE>
cat &#62;file
</PRE>
<P>
and then upload your text into that.  Then, in Elm or Pine, you can insert
the message with a simple command (control-R in Pine, for example); only
this time you won't see all that extraneous stuff.

<P>
Imagine a conversation carried out over a period of hours and days,
as if people were leaving messages and responses on a bulletin board.  Or 
imagine the electronic equivalent of a radio talk show where everybody 
can put their two cents in and no one is ever on hold. 
<P>
<A NAME="IDX160"></A>
<A NAME="IDX161"></A>
Unlike e-mail, which is usually "one-to-one,"  Usenet is "many-to-many."
Usenet is the international meeting place, where people gather to meet 
their friends, discuss the day's events, keep up with computer trends or 
talk about whatever's on their mind.  Jumping into a Usenet discussion 
can be a liberating experience.  Nobody knows what you look or sound 
like, how old you are, what your background is.  You're judged solely on 
your words, your ability to make a point. 
<P>
To many people, Usenet IS the Net. In fact, it is often confused
with Internet.  But it is a totally separate system. All Internet sites
CAN carry Usenet, but so do many non-Internet sites, from sophisticated
<A NAME="IDX162"></A>
<A NAME="IDX163"></A>
<A NAME="IDX164"></A>
Unix machines to old XT clones and Apple IIs. 
<P>
Technically, Usenet messages are shipped around the world, from
host system to host system, using one of several specific Net
protocols.  Your host system stores all of its Usenet messages in one
place, which everybody with an account on the system can access. That
way, no matter how many people actually read a given message, each
host system has to store only one copy of it. Many host systems "talk"
with several others regularly in case one or another of their links goes
down for some reason.  When two host systems connect, they basically
compare notes on which Usenet messages they already have.  Any that one
is missing the other then transmits, and vice-versa.  Because they are
computers, they don't mind running through thousands, even millions, of
these comparisons every day.
<P>
Yes, millions.  For Usenet is huge.  Every day, Usenet users
pump upwards of 40 million characters a day into the system -- roughly 
the equivalent of volumes A-G of the Encyclopedia Britannica. Obviously, 
nobody could possibly keep up with this immense flow of messages.  Let's 
<A NAME="IDX165"></A>
look at how to find conferences and discussions of interest to you.
<P>
The basic building block of Usenet is the newsgroup, which is a
collection of messages with a related theme (on other networks, these
would be called conferences, forums, boards or special-interest
groups).  There are now more than 5,000 of these newsgroups, in several 
diferent languages, covering everything from art to zoology, from 
science fiction to South Africa.
<P>
Some public-access systems, typically the ones that work through 
menus, try to make it easier by dividing Usenet into several broad 
categories.  Choose one of those and you're given a list of newsgroups in 
that category.  Then select the newsgroup you're interested in and start 
reading. 
<P>
Other systems let you compile your own "reading list" so that you
only see messages in conferences you want.  In both cases, conferences
are arranged in a particular hierarchy devised in the early 1980s.
Newsgroup names start with one of a series of broad topic names.  For 
example, newsgroups beginning with "comp." are about particular
computer-related topics.  These broad topics are followed by a series of
more focused topics (so that <TT>comp.unix</TT> groups are limited to
<A NAME="IDX166"></A>
discussion about Unix).  The main hierarchies are:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>bionet</CODE>
<DD>Research biology
<P>
<DT><CODE>bit.listserv</CODE>
<DD>Conferences originating as Bitnet mailing lists

<P>
<DT><CODE>news</CODE>
<DD>News about Usenet itself
<P>
<DT><CODE>rec</CODE>
<DD>Hobbies, games and recreation
<P>
<DT><CODE>sci</CODE>
<DD>Science other than research biology
<P>
<DT><CODE>soc</CODE>
<DD>"Social" groups, often ethnically related
<P>
<DT><CODE>talk</CODE>
<DD>Politics and related topics
<P>
<DT><CODE>alt</CODE>
<DD>Controversial or unusual topics; not carried by all sites
</DL>
<P>
In addition, many host systems carry newsgroups for a particular
city, state or region.  For example, <TT>ne.housing</TT> is a newsgroup where
New Englanders look for apartments.  A growing number also carry K12
newsgroups, which are aimed at elementary and secondary teachers and
students.  And a number of sites carry clari newsgroups, which is
actually a commercial service consisting of wire-service stories and
a unique online computer news service (see section <A HREF="bdg_218.html#SEC221">News of the World</A>).

<P>
How do you dive right in?  As mentioned, on some systems, it's all 
done through menus -- you just keep choosing from a list of choices until 
you get to the newsgroup you want and then hit the "read" command.  On 
Unix systems, however, you will have to use a "newsreader" program.  Two 
of the more common ones are known as rn (for "read news") and nn (for
<A NAME="IDX167"></A>
<A NAME="IDX168"></A>
"no news" -- because it's supposed to be simpler to use). 
<P>
For beginners, nn may be the better choice because it works with
menus -- you get a list of articles in a given newsgroup and then you 
choose which ones you want to see.  To try it out, connect to your host 
system and, at the command line, type 
<P>
<PRE>
nn news.announce.newusers
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  After a few seconds, you should see something like
this:

</PRE>
<P>
Obviously, this is a good newsgroup to begin your exploration of
Usenet!  Here's what all this means:  The first letter on each line is
the letter you type to read that particular "article" (it makes sense
that a "newsgroup" would have "articles").  Next comes the name of the
person who wrote that article, followed by its length, in lines, and
what the article is about. At the bottom, you see the local time at your
access site, what you're doing right now (i.e., SELECTing articles),
which key to hit for some help (the ? key) and how many of the articles
in the newsgroup you can see on this screen. The "(moderated)" means the
newsgroup has a "moderator" who is the only one who can directly post
messages to it.  This is generally limited to groups such as this, which
contain articles of basic information, or for digests, which are
basically online magazines (more on them in a bit).
<P>
Say you're particularly interested in what "Emily Postnews"
(see section <A HREF="bdg_266.html#SEC269">Dear Emily Postnews</A>) has to
say about proper etiquette on Usenet. Hit your c key (lower case!), and
the line will light up.  If you want to read something else, hit the key
that corresponds to it.  And if you want to see what's on the next page
of articles, hit return or your space bar.
<P>
But you're impatient to get going, and you want to read that
article now.  The command for that in nn is a capital Z.  Hit it and
you'll see something like this:

they are -- admonitions about what NOT to do.


"Dear Emily Postnews"

Emily Postnews, foremost authority on proper net behaviour,
gives her advice on how to act on the net.

=========================================================================

Dear Miss Postnews: How long should my signature be? -- verbose@noisy

A: Dear Verbose: Please try and make your signature as long as you
-- 09:57 --.announce.newusers-- LAST --help:?--Top 4%--
</PRE>
<P>
The first few lines are the message's header, similar to the header
you get in e-mail messages.  Then comes the beginning of the message.
The last line tells you the time again, the newsgroup name (or part of
it, anyway), the position in your message stack that this message
occupies, how to get help, and how much of the message is on screen.  If
you want to keep reading this message, just hit your space bar (not your
enter key!) for the next screen and so on until done. When done, you'll
be returned to the newsgroup menu.  For now hit Q (upper case this time),
which quits you out of nn and returns you to your host system's command
line.
<P>
To get a look at another interesting newsgroup, type
<P>
<PRE>
nn comp.risks
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  This newsgroup is another moderated group, this time a
digest of all the funny and frightening ways computers and the people
who run and use them can go wrong.  Again, you read articles by
selecting their letters.  If you're in the middle of an article and
decide you want to go onto the next one, hit your n key.
<P>
Now it's time to look for some newsgroups that might be of
particular interest to you.  Unix host systems that have nn use a program
called nngrep (ever get the feeling Unix was not entirely written in
English?) that lets you scan newsgroups.  Exit nn and at your host
system's command line, type
<P>
<PRE>
nngrep word
<A NAME="IDX169"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
where word is the subject you're interested in.  If you use a Macintosh
computer, you might try
<P>
<PRE>
nngrep mac
</PRE>
<P>
You'll get something that looks like this:
<P>
<PRE>
alt.music.machines.of.loving.grace
alt.religion.emacs
comp.binaries.mac
comp.emacs
comp.lang.forth.mac
comp.os.mach
comp.sources.mac
comp.sys.mac.announce
comp.sys.mac.apps
comp.sys.mac.comm
comp.sys.mac.databases
comp.sys.mac.digest
comp.sys.mac.games
comp.sys.mac.hardware
comp.sys.mac.hypercard
comp.sys.mac.misc
comp.sys.mac.programmer
comp.sys.mac.system
comp.sys.mac.wanted
gnu.emacs.announce
gnu.emacs.bug
gnu.emacs.gnews
gnu.emacs.gnus
gnu.emacs.help
gnu.emacs.lisp.manual
gnu.emacs.sources
gnu.emacs.vm.bug
gnu.emacs.vm.info
gnu.emacs.vms
</PRE>
<P>
Note that some of these obviously have something to do with
Macintoshes while some obviously do not; nngrep is not a perfect system.
If you want to get a list of ALL the newsgroups available on your host
system, type
<P>
<PRE>
nngrep -a |more
</PRE>
or
<PRE>
nngrep -a |pg
<A NAME="IDX170"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter (which one to use depends on the Unix used on your host
system; if one doesn't do anything, try the other). You don't
absolutely need the |more or |pg, but if you don't include it, the list
will keep scrolling, rather than pausing every 24 lines.  If you are in
nn, hitting a capital Y will bring up a similar list.
<P>
Typing <SAMP>`nn newsgroup'</SAMP> for every newsgroup can get awfully tiring
after awhile.  When you use nn, your host system looks in a file called
<TT>`.newsrc'</TT>.  This is basically a list of every newsgroup on the host system
along with notations on which groups and articles you have read (all
maintained by the computer).  You can also use this file to create a
"reading list" that brings up each newsgroup to which you want to
<A NAME="IDX171"></A>
<A NAME="IDX172"></A>
"subscribe."  To try it out, type
<P>
<PRE>
nn
</PRE>
<P>
without any newsgroup name, and hit enter.
<P>
Unfortunately, you will start out with a <TT>`.newsrc'</TT> file that has you
"subscribed" to every single newsgroup on your host system!  To delete
a newsgroup from your reading list, type a capital U while its menu is
on the screen.  The computer will ask you if you're sure you want to
"unsubscribe."  If you then hit a Y, you'll be unsubscribed and put in
the next group.
<P>
With many host systems carrying thousands of newsgroups, this will 
take you forever.
<P>
Fortunately, there are a couple of easier ways to do this.  Both
involve calling up your <TT>`.newsrc'</TT> file in a word or text processor.  In a
<TT>`.newsrc'</TT> file, each newsgroup takes up one line, consisting of the
group's name, an exclamation point or a colon and a range of numbers.
<P>
Newsgroups with a colon are ones to which you are subscribed; those 
followed by an exclamation point are "un-subscribed."  To start with a 
clean slate, then, you have to change all those colons to exclamation 
points.
If you know some UNIX, it's a one-liner, just type:
<P>
<PRE>
tr ':' '!' &#60; .newsrc &#62; temprc
</PRE>
<P>
and you're done. Without the <CODE>tr</CODE> command you must use a text
<A NAME="IDX173"></A>
editor.
<P>
If you know how to use emacs or vi, call up the <TT>`.newsrc'</TT> file (you
might want to make a copy of <TT>`.newsrc'</TT> first, just in case), and use the
<A NAME="IDX174"></A>
<A NAME="IDX175"></A>
search-and-replace function to make the change.
<P>
If you're not comfortable with these text processors, you can
download the <TT>`.newsrc'</TT> file, make the changes on your own computer and
then upload the revised file.  Before you download the file, however,
you should do a couple of things.  One is to type
<P>
<PRE>
cp .newsrc temprc
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  You will actually download this temprc file (note the
name does not start with a period -- some computers, such as those using
MS-DOS, do not allow file names starting with periods).  After you
download the file, open it in your favorite word processor and use its
search-and-replace function to change the exclamation points to colons.
Be careful not to change anything else!  Save the document in ASCII or
text format.  Dial back into your host system.  At the command line,
type
<P>
<PRE>
cp temprc temprc1
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  This new file will serve as your backup <TT>`.newsrc'</TT> file
just in case something goes wrong. Upload the temprc file from your
computer.  This will overwrite the Unix system's old temprc file.  Now
type
<P>
<PRE>
cp temprc .newsrc
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  You now have a clean slate to start creating a reading
list.

The first thing to understand about Usenet is that it is widely
misunderstood.  Every day on Usenet, the "blind men and the elephant"
phenomenon is evident, in spades.  In my opinion, more flame wars
arise because of a lack of understanding of the nature of Usenet than
from any other source.  And consider that such flame wars arise, of
necessity, among people who are on Usenet.  Imagine, then, how poorly
understood Usenet must be by those outside!

</PRE>
<P>
This time, the header looks much more like the gobbledygook you get 
in e-mail messages.  To keep reading, hit your space bar.  If you hit
your n key (lower case), you'll go to the next message in the 
numerical order.
<P>
To escape rn, just keep hitting your q key (in lower case), until
you get back to the command line.  Now let's set up your reading list.
Because rn uses the same <TT>`.newsrc'</TT> file as nn, you can use one of the
search-and-replace methods described above.  Or you can do this:  Type
<P>
<PRE>
rn
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  When the first newsgroup comes up on your screen, hit
your u key (in lower case).  Hit it again, and again, and again.  Or
just keep it pressed down (if your computer starts beeping, let up for a
couple of seconds).  Eventually, you'll be told you're at the end of the 
newsgroups, and asked what you want to do next.  
<P>
Here's where you begin entering newsgroups.  Type
<P>
<PRE>
g newsgroup
</PRE>
<P>
(for example, <SAMP>`g comp.sys.mac.announce'</SAMP>) and hit enter.  You'll be asked
if you want to "subscribe." Hit your y key.  Then type
<P>
<PRE>
g next newsgroup
</PRE>
<P>
(for example, <SAMP>`g comp.announce.newusers'</SAMP>) and hit enter.  Repeat until
done.  This process will also set up your reading list for nn, if you
prefer that newsreader. But how do you know which newsgroups to
subscribe?  Typing a lowercase l and then hitting enter will show you a 
list of all available newsgroups.  Again, since there could be more than
2,000 newsgroups on your system, this might not be something you want to
do.  Fortunately, you can search for groups with particular words in
their names, using the l command.  Typing
<P>
<PRE>
l mac
</PRE>
<P>
followed by enter, will bring up a list of newsgroups with those letters
in them (and as in nn, you will also see groups dealing with emacs and
the like, in addition to groups related to Macintosh computers).
<P>
Because of the vast amount of messages transmitted over Usenet,
most systems carry messages for only a few days or weeks.  So if there's
a message you want to keep, you should either turn on your computer's
screen capture or save it to a file which you can later download).  To
save a message as a file in rn, type
<P>
<PRE>
s filename
</PRE>
<P>
where filename is what you want to call the file. Hit enter.  You'll be
asked if you want to save it in "mailbox format."  In most cases, you
can answer with an n (which will strip off the header).  The message
will now be saved to a file in your News directory (which you can access
<A NAME="IDX178"></A>
<A NAME="IDX179"></A>
by typing <SAMP>`cd News'</SAMP> and then hitting enter).
<P>
Also, some newsgroups fill up particularly quickly -- go away for a
couple of days and you'll come back to find hundreds of articles!  One
way to deal with that is to mark them as "read" so that they no longer
appear on your screen.  In nn, hit a capital J; in rn, a small c.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - rn Commands</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_68.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_70.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC72" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC72">rn Commands</A></H2>
<P>
Different commands are available to you in rn depending on whether you
are already in a newsgroup or reading a specific article. At any point,
typing a lowercase <SAMP>`h'</SAMP> will bring up a list of available commands
<A NAME="IDX180"></A>
and some terse instructions for using them. Here are some of them:
<P>
After you've just called up rn, or within a newsgroup:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>c</CODE>
<DD>Marks every article in a newsgroup as read (or "caught up")
so that you don't have to see them again. The system will ask
you if you are sure. Can be done either when asked if you
want to read a particular newsgroup or once in the newsgroup.
<P>
<DT><CODE>g</CODE>
<DD>Goes to a newsgroup, in this form:
<P>
<DT><CODE>g news.group</CODE>
<DD><P>
Use this both for going to groups to which you're already
subscribed and subscribing to new groups.
<P>
<DT><CODE>h</CODE>
<DD>Provides a list of available commands with terse
instructions.
<P>
<DT><CODE>l</CODE>
<DD>Gives a list of all available newsgroups.
<P>
<DT><CODE>p</CODE>
<DD>Goes to the first previous subscribed newsgroup with un-read
articles.
<P>
<DT><CODE>q</CODE>
<DD>Quits, or exits, rn if you have not yet gone into a newsgroup.
If you are in a newsgroup, it quits that one and brings you to
the next subscribed newsgroup.
</DL>
<P>
Only within a newsgroup:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>=</CODE>
<DD>Gives a list of all available articles in the newsgroup.
<P>
<DT><CODE>m</CODE>
<DD>Marks a specific article or series of articles as "un-read"
again so that you can come back to them later. Typing
<SAMP>`1700m'</SAMP> and hitting enter would mark just that article as un-read.
Typing <SAMP>`1700-1800m'</SAMP>
and hitting enter would mark all of those articles as un-read.
<P>
<DT><CODE>s file</CODE>
<DD>Copies the current article to a file in your News directory,
where "file" is the name of the file you want to save it to.
You'll be asked if you want to use "mailbox" format when
saving. If you answer by hitting your <SAMP>`N'</SAMP> key, most of the
header will not be saved.
<P>
<DT><CODE>space</CODE>
<DD>Brings up the next page of article listings.  If already on
the last page, displays the first article in the newsgroup.
<P>
<DT><CODE>u</CODE>
<DD>Un-subscribe from the newsgroup.
<P>
<DT><CODE>/text/</CODE>
<DD>Searches through the newsgroup for articles with a specific
word or phrase in the "Subject:" line, from the current
article to the end of the newsgroup. For example,
<P>
<DT><CODE>/EFF/</CODE>
<DD>would bring you to the first article with "EFF" in the
"Subject:" line.
<P>
<DT><CODE>?text?</CODE>
<DD>The same as <SAMP>`/text/'</SAMP> except it searches in reverse order from 
the current article.
</DL>
<P>
Only within a specific article:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>C</CODE>
<DD>If you post an article and then decide it was a mistake, call
it up on your host system and hit this.  The message will soon
begin disappearing on systems around the world.
<P>
<DT><CODE>F</CODE>
<DD>Post a public response in the newsgroup to the current
article.  Includes a copy of her posting, which you can then
edit down using your host system's text editor.
<P>
<DT><CODE>f</CODE>
<DD>The same as above except it does not include a copy of the
original message in yours.
<P>
<DT><CODE>m</CODE>
<DD>Marks the current article as "un-read" so that you can come
back to it later.  You do not have to type the article
number.
<P>
<DT><CODE>Control-N</CODE>
<DD>Brings up the first response to the article. If there is no
follow-up article, this returns you to the first unread article
in the newsgroup).
<P>
<DT><CODE>Control-P</CODE>
<DD>Goes to the message to which the current article is a reply.
<P>
<DT><CODE>n</CODE>
<DD>Goes to the next unread article in the newsgroup.
<P>
<DT><CODE>N</CODE>
<DD>Takes you to the next article in the newsgroup even if you've
already read it.
<P>
<DT><CODE>q</CODE>
<DD>Quits, or exits, the current article. Leaves you in the current
newsgroup.
<P>
<DT><CODE>R</CODE>
<DD>Reply, via e-mail only, to the author of the current article.
Includes a copy of his message in yours.
<P>
<DT><CODE>r</CODE>
<DD>The same as above, except it does not include a copy of his
article.
<P>
<DT><CODE>s |mail user</CODE>
<DD>Mails a copy of the article to somebody. For "user" substitute
an e-mail address. Does not let you add comments to the
message first, however.
<P>
<DT><CODE>space</CODE>
<DD>Hitting the space bar shows the next page of the article, or, if
at the end, goes to the next un-read article.

<P>
With so much to choose from, everybody will likely have their own 
unique Usenet reading list.  But there are a few newsgroups that are 
particularly of interest to newcomers.  Among them:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<TT>news.announce.newusers</TT>
This group consists of a series of
articles that explain various facets of
Usenet.
<P>
<TT>news.newusers.questions</TT>
This is where you can ask questions 
(we'll see how in a bit) about how
Usenet works.
<P>
<TT>news.announce.newsgroups</TT>
Look here for information about new or
proposed newsgroups.
<P>
<TT>news.answers</TT>
Contains lists of "Frequently Asked
Questions"  (FAQs) and their answers from 
many different newsgroups.  Learn how to
fight jet lag in the FAQ from 
<TT>rec.travel.air</TT>; look up answers to common
questions about Microsoft Windows in
an FAQ from <TT>comp.os.ms-windows</TT>; etc.
<P>
<TT>alt.internet.services</TT>
Looking for something in particular on 
the Internet?  Ask here.
<P>
<TT>alt.infosystems.announce</TT>
People adding new information services to
the Internet will post details here.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Speaking up</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_70.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_72.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC74" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC74">Speaking up</A></H2>
<P>
"Threads" are an integral part of Usenet.  When somebody posts a
message, often somebody else will respond.  Soon, a thread of
conversation begins.  Following these threads is relatively easy.  In
nn, related messages are grouped together.  In rn, when you're done
with a message, you can hit control-N to read the next related
message, or followup.  As you explore Usenet, it's probably a good
idea to read discussions for a while before you jump in.  This way, you 
can get a feel for the particular newsgroup -- each has its 
<A NAME="IDX182"></A>
own rhythms.
<P>
Eventually, though, you'll want to speak up.  There are two main
ways to do this.  You join an existing conversation, or you can start
a whole new thread.
<P>
If you want to join a discussion, you have to decide if you want
to include portions of the message you are responding to in your
message.  The reason to do this is so people can see what you're
responding to, just in case the original message has disappeared from
their system (remember that most Usenet messages have a short life span 
on the average host system) or they can't find it.
<P>
If you're using a Unix host system, joining an existing
conversation is similar in both nn and rn: hit your F key when done
with a given article in the thread.  In rn, type a small f if you
don't want to include portions of the message you're responding to; an
uppercase F if you do. In nn, type a capital F.  You'll then be asked
if you want to include portions of the original message.
<P>
And here's where you hit another Unix wall.  When you hit your F
key, your host system calls up its basic Unix text editor.  If you're
lucky, that'll be Pico, a very easy system.  More likely, however,
you'll get dumped into emacs (or possibly vi), which you've already met
<A NAME="IDX183"></A>
<A NAME="IDX184"></A>
in the chapter on e-mail.
<P>
The single most important emacs command is
<P>
<PRE>
control-x control-c
</PRE>
<P>
This means, depress your control key and hit x.  Then depress the
control key and hit c.  Memorize this.  In fact, it's so important, it
bears repeating:
<P>
<PRE>
control-x control-c
</PRE>
<P>
These keystrokes are how you get out of emacs.  If they work well,
you'll be asked if you want to send, edit, abort or list the message you
were working on.  If they don't work well (say you accidentally hit some
other weird key combination that means something special to emacs) and
nothing seems to happen, or you just get more weird-looking emacs
prompts on the bottom of your screen, try hitting control-g. This should
stop whatever emacs was trying to do (you should see the word "quit" on
the bottom of your screen), after which you can hit control-x control-c.
But if this still doesn't work, remember that you can always disconnect
and dial back in!
<P>
If you have told your newsreader you do want to include portions
of the original message in yours, it will automatically put the entire
thing at the top of your message.  Use the arrow keys to move down to
the lines you want to delete and hit control-K, which will delete one
line at a time.
<P>
You can then write your message.  Remember that you have to hit
enter before your cursor gets to the end of the line, because emacs
does not have word wrapping.
<P>
When done, hit control-X control-C.  You'll be asked the
question about sending, editing, aborting, etc.  Chose one.  If you
hit Y, your host system will start the process to sending your
message across the Net.
<P>
The nn and rn programs work differently when it comes to posting
entirely new messages.  In nn, type
<P>
<PRE>
:post
<A NAME="IDX185"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter in any newsgroup.  You'll be asked which newsgroup to
post a message to.  Type in its name and hit enter.  Then you'll be
asked for "keywords."  These are words you'd use to attract somebody
scanning a newsgroup.  Say you're selling your car.  You might type
the type of car here.  Next comes a "summary" line, which is somewhat
similar.  Finally, you'll be asked for the message's "distribution."
This is where you put how widely you want your message disseminated.
Think about this one for a second.  If you are selling your car, it
makes little sense to send a message about it all over the world.  But
if you want to talk about the environment, it might make a lot of
sense.  Each host system has its own set of distribution
classifications, but there's generally a local one (just for users of
that system), one for the city, state or region it's in, another for
the country (for example, usa), one for the continent (for Americans
and Canadians, na) and finally, one for the entire world (usually:
world).
<P>
Which one to use?  Generally, a couple of seconds' thought will
help you decide.  If you're selling your car, use your city or regional
distribution -- people in Australia won't much care and may even get
annoyed.  If you want to discuss presidential politics, using a USA
distribution makes more sense.  If you want to talk about events in the
Middle East, sending your message to the entire world is perfectly
acceptable.
<P>
Then you can type your message.  If you've composed your message
offline (generally a good idea if you and emacs don't get along), you
can upload it now.  You may see a lot of weird looking characters as
it uploads into emacs, but those will disappear when you hit control-X
and then control-C.  Alternately: "save" the message (for example, by 
hitting m in rn), log out, compose your message offline, log back on and 
upload your message into a file on your host system.  Then call up 
Usenet, find the article you "saved." Start a reply, and you'll be asked 
if you want to include a prepared message.  Type in the name of the file 
you just created and hit enter.
<P>
In rn, you have to wait until you get to the end of a newsgroup
to hit F, which will bring up a message-composing system.
Alternately, at your host system's command line, you can type
<P>
<PRE>
Pnews
<A NAME="IDX186"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  You'll be prompted somewhat similarly to the nn
system, except that you'll be given a list of possible distributions.
If you chose "world," you'll get this message:
<P>
This program posts news to thousands of machines throughout the entire
civilized world.  Your message will cost the net hundreds if not thousands of
dollars to send everywhere.  Please be sure you know what you are doing.
<P>
<EM>Are you absolutely sure that you want to do this? [ny]</EM>
<P>
Don't worry -- your message won't really cost the Net untold
amounts, although, again, it's a good idea to think for a second
whether your message really should go everywhere.
<P>
If you want to respond to a given post through e-mail, instead of
publicly, hit R in nn or r or R in rn.  In rn, as with follow-up
articles, the uppercase key includes the original message in yours.
<P>
Most newsgroups are unmoderated, which means that every message
you post will eventually wind up on every host system within the
geographic region you specified that carries that newsgroup.
<P>
Some newsgroups, however, are moderated, as you saw earlier with
<TT>comp.risks</TT>.  In these groups, messages are shipped to a single
location where a moderator, acting much like a magazine editor,
decides what actually gets posted.  In some cases, groups are
moderated like scholarly journals.  In other cases, it's to try to cut
down on the massive number of messages that might otherwise be posted.
<P>
You'll notice that many articles in Usenet end with a fancy
"signature" that often contains some witty saying, a clever drawing
and, almost incidentally, the poster's name and e-mail address.  You
too can have your own "signature" automatically appended to everything
you post.  On your own computer, create a signature file.  Try to keep
it to four lines or less, lest you annoy others on the Net.  Then,
while connected to your host system, type
<P>
<PRE>
cat &#62;.signature
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter (note the period before the s).  Upload your signature
file into this using your communications software's ASCII upload
protocol.  When done, hit control-D, the Unix command for closing a
file.  Now, every time you post a message, this will be appended to it.
<P>
There are a few caveats to posting.  Usenet is no different from
a Town Meeting or publication: you're not supposed to break the law,
whether that's posting copyrighted material or engaging in illegal
activities.  It is also not a place to try to sell products (except in
certain <TT>biz.*</TT> and explicit for-sale newsgroups).

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Cross-posting</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_71.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_73.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC75" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC75">Cross-posting</A></H2>
<P>
Sometimes, you'll have an issue you think should be discussed in
more than one newsgroup.  Rather than posting individual messages in
each group, you can post the same message in several groups at once,
through a process known as cross-posting.
<P>
Say you want to start a discussion about the political
ramifications of importing rare tropical fish from Brazil.  People who
read <TT>rec.aquaria</TT> might have something to say. So might people who read
<TT>alt.politics.animals</TT> and
<A NAME="IDX187"></A>
<TT>talk.politics.misc</TT>.
<P>
Cross-posting is easy.  It also should mean that people on other 
systems who subscribe to several newsgroups will see your message only 
once, rather than several times -- news-reading software can cancel out 
the other copies once a person has read the message.  When you get ready 
to post a message (whether through Pnews for rn or the <SAMP>`:post'</SAMP> command in 
nn), you'll be asked in which newsgroups.  Type the names of the various 
groups, separated by a comma, but no space, for example: 
<P>
<PRE>
rec.aquaria,alt.politics.animals,talk.politics.misc
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  After answering the other questions (geographic
distribution, etc.), the message will be posted in the various
groups (unless one of the groups is moderated, in which case the
message goes to the moderator, who decides whether to make it public).
<P>
It's considered bad form to post to an excessive number of
newsgroups, or inappropriate newsgroups.  Probably, you don't really have 
to post something in 20 different places.  And while you may think your 
particular political issue is vitally important to the fate of the world, 
chances are the readers of <TT>rec.arts.comics</TT> will not, or at least not 
important enough to impose on them.  You'll get a lot of nasty e-mail 
messages demanding you restrict your messages to the "appropriate" 
newsgroups.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Flame and Blather and Spew</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_73.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_75.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC77" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC77">Flame, Blather and Spew</A></H2>
<P>
Something about online communications seems to make some people
particularly irritable.  Perhaps it's the immediacy and semi-anonymity
of it all.  Whatever it is, there are whole classes of people you will
soon think seem to exist to make you miserable.
<P>
Rather than pausing and reflecting on a message as one might do
with a letter received on paper, it's just so easy to hit your R key
and tell somebody you don't really know what you really think of them.
Even otherwise calm people sometimes find themselves turning into
raving lunatics.  When this happens, flames erupt.  
<P>
A flame is a particularly nasty, personal attack on somebody for 
something he or she has written.  Periodically, an exchange of flames 
erupts into a flame war that begin to take up all the space in a given 
newsgroup (and sometimes several; flamers like cross-posting to let the 
world know how they feel).  These can go on for weeks (sometimes they go 
on for years, in which case they become "holy wars," usually on such 
topics as the relative merits of Macintoshes and IBMs).  Often, just when 
they're dying down, somebody new to the flame war reads all the messages, 
gets upset and issues an urgent plea that the flame war be taken to e-mail
so everybody else can get back to whatever the newsgroup's business 
is.  All this usually does, though, is start a brand new flame war, in 
which this poor person comes under attack for daring to question the 
First Amendment, prompting others to jump on the attackers for impugning 
<A NAME="IDX188"></A>
<A NAME="IDX189"></A>
<A NAME="IDX190"></A>
<A NAME="IDX191"></A>
<A NAME="IDX192"></A>
this poor soul...  You get the idea. 
<P>
Every so often, a discussion gets so out of hand that somebody
predicts that either the government will catch on and shut the whole
thing down or somebody will sue to close down the network, or maybe
even the wrath of God will smote everybody involved.  This brings what
has become an inevitable rejoinder from others who realize that the
network is, in fact, a resilient creature that will not die easily:
<EM>"Imminent death of Usenet predicted. Film at 11."</EM>
<P>
Flame wars can be tremendously fun to watch at first.  They
quickly grow boring, though.  And wait until the first time you're
attacked!
<P>
<A NAME="IDX193"></A>
<A NAME="IDX194"></A>
<A NAME="IDX195"></A>
<EM>Flamers</EM> are not the only <B>Net.characters</B> to watch out for.
<P>
<EM>Spewers</EM> assume that whatever they are particularly concerned about
either really is of universal interest or should be rammed down the
<A NAME="IDX196"></A>
throats of people who don't seem to care -- as frequently as possible.
<P>
You can usually tell a spewer's work by the number of articles he posts 
in a day on the same subject and the number of newsgroups to which he 
then sends these articles -- both can reach well into double digits. 
Often, these messages relate to various ethnic conflicts around the 
world. Frequently, there is no conceivable connection between the issue 
at hand and most of the newsgroups to which he posts.  No matter.  If you 
try to point this out in a response to one of these messages, you will be 
inundated with angry messages that either accuse you of being an 
insensitive racist/American/whatever or ignore your point entirely to
bring up several hundred more lines of commentary on the perfidy of
whoever it is the spewer thinks is out to destroy his people.
<P>
Closely related to these folks are the Holocaust revisionists, who
periodically inundate certain groups (such as <TT>soc.history</TT>) with long
rants about how the Holocaust never really happened.  Some people
attempt to refute these people with facts, but others realize this only
<A NAME="IDX197"></A>
encourages them.
<P>
<EM>Blatherers</EM> tend to be more benign.  Their problem is that they
just can't get to the point -- they can wring three or four screenfuls
out of a thought that others might sum up in a sentence or two.  A
related condition is excessive quoting.  People afflicted with this will
include an entire message in their reply rather than excising the
portions not relevant to whatever point they're trying to make.  The
<A NAME="IDX198"></A>
worst quote a long message and then add a single line:
<P>
"I agree!" or some such, often followed by a monster .signature
(see section <A HREF="bdg_81.html#SEC84">Big Sig</A>).
There are a number of other Usenet denizens you'll soon come to
recognize.  Among them:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX199"></A>
<DT><B>Net.weenies</B>
<DD>These are the kind of people who enjoy Insulting
others, the kind of people who post nasty messages in a sewing
newsgroup just for the hell of it.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX200"></A>
<DT><B>Net.geeks</B>
<DD>People to whom the Net is Life, who worry about what
happens when they graduate and they lose their free, 24-hour access.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX201"></A>
<DT><B>Net.gods</B>
<DD>The old-timers; the true titans of the Net and the
keepers of its collective history. They were around when the Net
consisted of a couple of computers tied together with baling wire.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX202"></A>
<DT><B>Lurkers</B>
<DD>Actually, you can't tell these people are there, but
they are.  They're the folks who read a newsgroup but never post or
respond.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX203"></A>
<DT><B>Wizards</B>
<DD>People who know a particular Net-related topic inside
and out.  Unix wizards can perform amazing tricks with that operating
system, for example.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX204"></A>
<DT><B>Net.saints</B>
<DD>Always willing to help a newcomer, eager to share
their knowledge with those not born with an innate ability to navigate
the Net, they are not as rare as you might think.  Post a question
about something and you'll often be surprised how many responses you
get.
</DL>
<P>
The last group brings us back to the Net's oral tradition.  With
few written guides, people have traditionally learned their way around
the Net by asking somebody, whether at the terminal next to them or on
the Net itself.  That tradition continues: if you have a question, ask.
<P>
Today, one of the places you can look for help is in the
<TT>news.newusers.questions</TT> newsgroup, which, as its name suggests, is a
place to learn more about Usenet.  But be careful what you post.  Some
of the Usenet wizards there get cranky sometimes when they have to
answer the same question over and over again. Oh, they'll eventually
answer your question, but not before they tell you should have 
asked your host system administrator first or looked at the postings in
<TT>news.announce.newusers</TT>.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Killfiles</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_74.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_76.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC78" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC78">Killfiles -- The cure for all that ails you</A></H2>
<P>
As you keep reading Usenet, you are going to run across things or
people that really drive you nuts -- or that you just get tired of
seeing.
<P>
Killfiles are just the thing for you. When you start your
newsreader, it checks to see if you have any lists of words, phrases
or names you don't want to see.  If you do, then it blanks out any
<A NAME="IDX205"></A>
messages containing those words.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX206"></A>
<A NAME="IDX207"></A>
Such as cascades.
<P>
As you saw earlier, when you post a reply to a message and
include parts of that message, the original lines show up with a &#62; in
front of them.  Well, what if you reply to a reply?  Then you get a &#62;&#62;
in front of the line.  And if you reply to that reply? You get &#62;&#62;&#62;.
Keep this up, and soon you get a triangle of &#62;'s building up in your
message.
<P>
There are people who like building up these triangles, or
cascades.  They'll "respond" to your message by deleting everything
you've said, leaving only the "In message 123435, you said:" part and
the last line of your message, to which they add a nonsensical 
retort.  On and on they go until the triangle has reached the right
end of the page. Then they try to expand the triangle by deleting one
with each new line. Whoever gets to finish this mega-triangle wins.
<P>
There is even a newsgroup just for such folks: alt.cascade.
Unfortunately, cascaders would generally rather cascade in other
newsgroups. Because it takes a lot of messages to build up a completed
cascade, the targeted newsgroup soon fills up with these messages. Of
course, if you complain, you'll be bombarded with messages about the
First Amendment and artistic expression -- or worse, with another
cascade. The only thing you can do is ignore them, by setting up a
killfile.
<P>
There are also certain newsgroups where killfiles will come in
handy because of the way the newsgroups are organized.  For example, readers of
<TT>rec.arts.tv.soaps</TT> always use an acronym in their "Subject:" line for
the show they're writing about (AMC, for example, for "All My
Children").  This way, people who only want to read about "One Life to
Live" can blank out all the messages about "The Young and the
Restless" and all the others (to keep people from accidentally
screening out messages that might contain the letters "gh" in them,
"General Hospital" viewers always use "gh:" in their subject lines).
<P>
Both nn and rn let you create killfiles, but in different ways.
<P>
To create a killfile in nn, go into the newsgroup with the
offending messages and type a capital <SAMP>`K'</SAMP>.  You'll see this at the
bottom of your screen:
<P>
<PRE>
AUTO (k)ill or (s)elect (CR =&#62; Kill subject 30 days)
</PRE>
<P>
If you hit return, nn will ask you which article's subject you're
tired of. Chose one and the article and any follow-ups will disappear,
and you won't see them again for 30 days.
If you type a lower-case <SAMP>`k'</SAMP> instead, you'll get this:
<P>
<PRE>
AUTO KILL on (s)ubject or (n)ame  (s)
</PRE>
<P>
If you hit your <SAMP>`S'</SAMP> key or just enter,  you'll see this:
<P>
<PRE>
KILL Subject: (=/)
</PRE>
<P>
Type in the name of the offending word or phrase and hit enter.
You'll then be prompted:
<P>
<PRE>
KILL in (g)roup 'eff.test' or in (a)ll groups  (g)
</PRE>
<P>
except that the name of the group you see will be the one you're
actually in at the moment.  Because cascaders and other annoying
people often cross-post their messages to a wide range of newsgroups,
you might consider hitting <SAMP>`a'</SAMP> instead of <SAMP>`g'</SAMP>.  Next comes:
<P>
<PRE>
Lifetime of entry in days (p)ermanent  (30)
</PRE>
<P>
The P key will screen out the offending articles forever, while
hitting enter will do it for 30 days.  You can also type in a number
of days for the blocking.
<P>
Creating killfiles in rn works differently -- its default
killfile generator only works for messages in specific groups, rather
than globally for your entire newsgroup list.  To create a global
killfile, you'll have to write one yourself.
<P>
To create a killfile in rn, go into the newsgroup where the
offending messages are and type in its number so you get it on your
screen. Type a capital <SAMP>`K'</SAMP>.  From now on, any message with that subject
line will disappear before you read the group. You should probably
choose a reply, rather than the original message, so that you will get
all of the followups (the original message won't have a "Re: " in its
subject line). The next time you call up that newsgroup, rn will tell
you it's killing messages. When it's done, hit the space bar to go
back into reading mode.
<P>
To create a "global" kill file that will automatically wipe out
articles in all groups you read, start rn and type control-K.  This
will start your whatever text editor you have as your default on your
host system and create a file (called <TT>`KILL'</TT>, in your <TT>`News'</TT>
subdirectory).
<P>
On the first line, you'll type in the word, phrase or name you
don't want to see, followed by commands that tell rn whether to search
an entire message for the word or name and then what to do when it
finds it.
<P>
Each line must be in this form
<P>
<PRE>
/pattern/modifier:j
</PRE>
<P>
"Pattern" is the word or phrase you want rn to look for.  It's
case-insensitive: both "test" and "Test" will be knocked out.  The
modifier tells rn whether to limit its search to message headers
(which can be useful when the object is to never see messages from a
particular person):
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>a:</CODE>
<DD>Looks through an entire message
<P>
<DT><CODE>h:</CODE>
<DD>Looks just at the header
</DL>
<P>
You can leave out the modifier command, in which case rn will
only look at the subject line of messages. The <SAMP>`j'</SAMP> at the end tells rn
to screen out all articles with the offending word.
<P>
So if you never want to see the word "foo" in any header, ever again,
type this:
<P>
<PRE>
/foo/h:j
<A NAME="IDX208"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
This is particularly useful for getting rid of articles from
people who post in more than one newsgroup, such as cascaders, since
an article's newsgroup name is always in the header.
<P>
If you just want to block messages with a subject line about
cascades, you could try:
<P>
<PRE>
/foo/:j
<A NAME="IDX209"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
To kill anything that is a followup to any article, use this
pattern:
<P>
<PRE>
/Subject: *Re:/:j
<A NAME="IDX210"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
When done writing lines for each phrase to screen, exit the text
editor as you normally would, and you'll be put back in rn.
<P>
One word of caution: go easy on the global killfile.  An
extensive global killfile, or one that makes frequent use of the <SAMP>`a:'</SAMP>
modifier can dramatically slow down rn, since the system will now have
to look at every single word in every single message in all the
newsgroups you want to read.
<P>
If there's a particular person whose posts you never want to see
again, first find his or address (which will be in the "from:" line of
his postings) and then write a line in your killfile like this:
<P>
<PRE>
/From: *name@address\.all/h:j
<A NAME="IDX211"></A>
</PRE>

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Some Usenet hints</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_75.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_77.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC79" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC79">Some Usenet hints</A></H2>
<P>
Case counts in Unix -- most of the time.  Many Unix commands,
including many of those used for reading Usenet articles, are case
sensitive.  Hit a <SAMP>`d'</SAMP> when you meant a <SAMP>`D'</SAMP> and either nothing will
happen,
or something completely different from what you expected will happen.
So watch that case!
<P>
In nn, you can get help most of the time by typing a question mark
(the exception is when you are writing your own message, because then
you are inside the text-processing program).  In rn, type a lower-case <SAMP>`h'</SAMP>
at any prompt to get some online help.
<P>
When you're searching for a particular newsgroup, whether through
the l command in rn or with nngrep for nn, you sometimes may have to
try several keywords.  For example, there is a newsgroup dedicated to
the <VAR>Grateful Dead</VAR>, but you'd never find it if you tried, say,
<SAMP>`l grateful dead'</SAMP>, because the name is <TT>rec.music.gdead</TT>.
In general, try the smallest
possible part of the word or discussion you're looking for, for example,
use "trek" to find newsgroups about "Star Trek."  If one word doesn't
<A NAME="IDX212"></A>
<A NAME="IDX213"></A>
produce anything, try another.

Net users sometimes like to think they are smarter or somehow better
than everybody else.  They're not.  If they were, nobody on the Net would
ever have heard of Craig Shergold, the Brain-Tumor Boy, or the evil FCC's
plan to tax your modem. And you wouldn't keep seeing the same dumb chain 
letter. Alas, all of these are here to stay.  Just when they seem to have 
died off, somebody posts a message about one or the other, starting a whole 
new round of flame wars on the subject. 
For the record, here are the stories then:

<H3><A NAME="SEC81" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC81">Craig Shergold</A></H3>
<P>
There once was a seven-year-old boy in England named Craig
Shergold who was diagnosed with a seemingly incurable brain tumor.  As
he lay dying, he wished only to have friends send him postcards.  The
local newspapers got a hold of the tear-jerking story.  Soon, the boy's 
wish had changed: he now wanted to get into the Guinness Book of World
Records for the largest postcard collection.  Word spread around the
<A NAME="IDX214"></A>
world. People by the millions sent him postcards.
<P>
Miraculously, the boy lived.  An American billionaire even flew
him to the U.S. for surgery to remove what remained of the tumor.  And
his wish succeeded beyond his wildest dreams -- he made the Guinness
Book of World Records.
<P>
But with Craig now well into his teens, his dream has turned into
a nightmare for the post office in the small town outside London where
he lives.  Like Craig himself, his request for cards just refuses to
die, inundating the post office with millions of cards every year.
Just when it seems like the flow is slowing, along comes somebody else
who starts up a whole new slew of requests for people to send Craig
post cards (or greeting cards or business cards -- Craig letters have
truly taken on a life of their own and begun to mutate). Even Dear Abby
has asked people to stop!
<P>
What does any of this have to do with the Net? The Craig letter
seems to pop up on Usenet as often as it does on cork boards at major 
corporations.  No matter how many times somebody like Gene Spafford
posts periodic messages to ignore them or spend your money on something
more sensible (a donation to the local Red Cross, say), somebody
manages to post a letter asking readers to send cards to poor little
Craig.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - The Modem Tax</TITLE>

<H3><A NAME="SEC82" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC82">The Modem Tax</A></H3>
<P>
In 1987, the Federal Communications Commission considered removing
a tax break it had granted CompuServe and other large commercial
computer networks for use of the national phone system.  The FCC
quickly reconsidered after alarmed users of bulletin-board systems
<A NAME="IDX215"></A>
<A NAME="IDX216"></A>
<A NAME="IDX217"></A>
bombarded it with complaints about this "modem tax." 
<P>
Now, every couple of months, somebody posts an "urgent" message
warning Net users that the FCC is about to impose a modem tax.  This is
NOT true.  The way you can tell if you're dealing with the hoax story
is simple: it ALWAYS mentions an incident in which a talk-show host on
KGO radio in San Francisco becomes outraged on the air when he reads a
story about the tax in the New York Times.
<P>
Another way to tell it's not true is that it never mentions a
specific FCC docket number or closing date for comments.
Save that letter to your congressman for something else.

Sooner or later, you're going to run into a message titled "Make Money 
Fast."  It's your basic chain letter.  The Usenet version is always about 
some guy named Dave Rhodes who was on the verge of death, or something, 
when he discovered a perfectly legal way to make tons of money -- by 
<A NAME="IDX218"></A>
posting a chain letter on computer systems around the world. Yeah, right.

There are .sigs and there are .sigs.  Many people put only bare-bones 
information in their .sig files -- their names and e-mail addresses,
perhaps their phone numbers.  Others add a quotation they think is funny or
profound and a disclaimer that their views are not those of their employer.
Still others add some ASCII-art graphics.  And then there are
those who go totally berserk, posting huge creations with multiple quotes,
hideous ASCII "barfics" and more e-mail addresses than anybody could
humanly need.  College freshmen unleashed on the Net seem to excel at
these.   You can see the best of the worst in the <TT>alt.fan.warlord</TT>

<P>
Usenet's international reach raises interesting legal questions that
have yet to be fully resolved.  Can a discussion or posting that is legal
in one country be transmitted to a country where it is against the law?
Does the posting even become illegal when it reaches the border?  And what
if that country is the only path to a third country where the message is
legal as well?  Several foreign colleges and other institutions have
cut off feeds of certain newsgroups where Americans post what is, in
the U.S., perfectly legal discussions of drugs or alternative sexual
practices.  Even in the U.S., some universities have discontinued
certain newsgroups their administrators find offensive, again, usually
in the <TT>alt.*</TT> hierarchy.

<P>
In the late 1970s, Unix developers came up with a new feature: a
system to allow Unix computers to exchange data over phone lines.
<P>
In 1979, two graduate students at Duke University in North
Carolina, <VAR>Tom Truscott</VAR> and <VAR>Jim Ellis</VAR>, came up with the idea
of using
this system, known as UUCP (for Unix-to-Unix CoPy), to distribute
information of interest to people in the Unix community.  Along with
<VAR>Steve Bellovin</VAR>, a graduate student at the University of North Carolina
and <VAR>Steve Daniel</VAR>, they wrote conferencing software and linked together
<A NAME="IDX221"></A>
<A NAME="IDX222"></A>
<A NAME="IDX223"></A>
<A NAME="IDX224"></A>
<A NAME="IDX225"></A>
computers at Duke and UNC.
<P>
Word quickly spread and by 1981, a graduate student at Berkeley,
<VAR>Mark Horton</VAR> and a nearby high school student, <VAR>Matt Glickman</VAR>, had
released a new version that added more features and was able to handle
larger volumes of postings -- the original North Carolina program was
<A NAME="IDX226"></A>
<A NAME="IDX227"></A>
meant for only a few articles in a newsgroup each day.
<P>
Today, Usenet connects tens of thousands of sites around the world,
from mainframes to Amigas.  With more than 3,000 newsgroups and untold
thousands of readers, it is perhaps the world's largest computer
network.

When you start up rn, you get a "warning" that "bogus
newsgroups" are present.
<P>
Within a couple of minutes, you'll be asked
whether to keep these or delete them.  Delete them.  Bogus newsgroups
are newsgroups that your system administrator or somebody else has
determined are no longer needed.
<P>
<LI>
While in a newsgroup in rn, you get a message: "skipping
unavailable article."  This is usually an article that somebody posted
and then decided to cancel.
<P>
<LI>
You upload a text file to your Unix host system for use in a 
Usenet message or e-mail, and when you or your recipient reads the file, 
every line ends with a <SAMP>`^M'</SAMP>.
<P>
This happens because Unix handles line endings differently than MS-
DOS or Macintosh computers.  Most Unix systems have programs to convert 
incoming files from other computers. To use it, upload your file and 
then, at your command line, type
<P>
<PRE>
dos2unix filename filename

<P>
or
<P>
<PRE>
mac2unix filename filename
<A NAME="IDX228"></A>
<A NAME="IDX229"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
depending on which kind of computer you are using and where filename is 
the name of the file you've just uploaded.  A similar program can prepare 
text files for downloading to your computer, for example:
<P>
<PRE>
unix2dos filename filename
</PRE>
<P>
or
<P>
<PRE>
unix2mac filename filename
<A NAME="IDX230"></A>
<A NAME="IDX231"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
will ensure that a text file you are about to get will not come out 
looking odd on your computer.

<H2><A NAME="SEC90" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC90">Internet Mailing Lists</A></H2>
<P>
Usenet is not the only forum on the Net.  Scores of "mailing
lists"  represent another way to interact with other Net users.
Unlike Usenet messages,  which are stored in one central location on
your host system's computer, mailing-list messages are delivered right
<A NAME="IDX234"></A>
<A NAME="IDX235"></A>
to your e-mail box, unlike Usenet messages.
<P>
You have to ask for permission to join a mailing list.  Unlike
Usenet, where your message is distributed to the world, on a mailing
list, you send your messages to a central moderator, who either re-mails
it to the other people on the list or uses it to compile a periodic
<A NAME="IDX236"></A>
<A NAME="IDX237"></A>
"digest" mailed to subscribers.
<P>
Given the number of newsgroups, why would anybody bother with a
mailing list?
<P>
Even on Usenet, there are some topics that just might not generate
enough interest for a newsgroup; for example, the <I>Queen</I> list, which is
all about the late <VAR>Freddie Mercury</VAR>'s band; or the <I>Marillion &#38; Fish</I>
<A NAME="IDX238"></A>
<A NAME="IDX239"></A>
<A NAME="IDX240"></A>
<A NAME="IDX241"></A>
<A NAME="IDX242"></A>
list called "Freaks."
<P>
And because a moderator decides who can participate, a mailing list
can offer a degree of freedom to speak one's mind (or not worry about
<B>net.weenies</B>) that is not necessarily possible on Usenet.  Several
groups offer anonymous postings -- only the moderator knows the real
names of people who contribute. Examples include 12Step, where people
enrolled in such programs as Alcoholics Anonymous can discuss their
experiences, and sappho, a list limited to gay and bisexual women.
<P>
You can find mailing addresses and descriptions of these lists
in the <TT>news.announce.newusers</TT> newsgroup with the subject of "Publicly
Accessible Mailing Lists."  Mailing lists now number in the hundreds,
so this posting is divided into three parts.
<P>
If you find a list to which you want to subscribe, send an e-mail
message to
<P>
<PRE>
list-request@address
</PRE>
<P>
where "list" is the name of the mailing list and "address" is the
moderator's e-mail address, asking to be added to the list.  Include
your full e-mail address just in case something happens to your
message's header along the way, and ask, if you're accepted, for the
address to mail messages to the list.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Bitnet Lists</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_87.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_89.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC91" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC91">Bitnet Lists</A></H2>
<P>
As if Usenet and mailing lists were not enough, there are
Bitnet "discussion groups" or "lists."
<P>
Bitnet is an international network linking colleges and
universities, but it uses a different set of technical protocols for
distributing information than the Internet or Usenet.
It offers hundreds of discussion groups, comparable in scope to
Usenet newsgroups.
<P>
One of the major differences is the way messages are
distributed.  Bitnet messages are sent to your mailbox, just as with a
mailing list. However, where mailing lists are often maintained by a
person, all Bitnet discussion groups are automated -- you subscribe to
them through messages to a "listserver" computer.  This is a kind of
robot moderator that controls distribution of messages on the list.  In
many cases, it also maintains indexes and archives of past postings in a
given discussion group, which can be handy if you want to get up to
speed with a discussion or just search for some information related to
<A NAME="IDX243"></A>
it.
<P>
Many Bitnet discussion groups are now "translated" into Usenet
form and carried through Usenet in the <TT>bit.listserv.*</TT> hierarchy.  In
general, it's probably better to read messages through Usenet if you
can.  It saves some storage space on your host system's hard drives.
<P>
If 50 people subscribe to the same Bitnet list, that means 50
copies of each message get stored on the system; whereas if 50 people
read a Usenet message, that's still only one message that needs storage
on the system.  It can also save your sanity if the discussion group
generates large numbers of messages.  Think of opening your e-mailbox
one day to find 200 messages in it -- 199 of them from a discussion
group and one of them a "real" e-mail message that's important to you.
<P>
Subscribing and canceling subscriptions is done through an e-mail
message to the listserver computer.  For addressing, all
listservers are known as "listserv" (yep) at some Bitnet address.
This means you will have to add <SAMP>`.bitnet'</SAMP> to the end of the
address, if it's in a form like this: <SAMP>`listserv@miamiu'</SAMP>. For example, if
you have an interest in environmental issues, you might want to
subscribe to the Econet discussion group.  To subscribe, send an e-mail
message to
<P>
<PRE>
listserv@miamiu.bitnet
</PRE>
<P>
Some Bitnet listservers are also connected to the Internet, so if you
see a listserver address ending in <SAMP>`.edu'</SAMP>, you can e-mail the
listserver without adding <SAMP>`.bitnet'</SAMP> to the end.
<P>
Always leave the "Subject:" line blank in a message to a
listserver.  Inside the message, you tell the listserver what you
want, with a series of simple commands:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>subscribe group <EM>Your Name</EM></CODE>
<DD>To subscribe to a list, where <B>group</B>
is the list name and <EM>Your Name</EM> is
your full name, for example:
<A NAME="IDX244"></A>
<SAMP>`subscribe econet Henry Fielding'</SAMP>
<P>
<DT><CODE>unsubscribe group <EM>Your Name</EM></CODE>
<DD>To discontinue a group, for example:
<A NAME="IDX245"></A>
<SAMP>`unsubscribe econet Henry Fielding'</SAMP>
<P>
<DT><CODE>list global</CODE>
<DD>This sends you a list of all available
Bitnet discussion groups.  But be careful -- the list is VERY long!
<P>
<DT><CODE>get refcard</CODE>
<DD>Sends you a list of other commands you
can use with a listserver, such as
commands for retrieving past postings
from a discussion group.
</DL>
<P>
Each of these commands goes on a separate line in your message
(and you can use one or all of them).  If you want to get a list of
all Bitnet discussion groups, send e-mail to
<P>
<PRE>
listserv@bitnic.educom.edu
</PRE>
<P>
Leave the "Subject:" line blank and use the list global command.
<P>
When you subscribe to a Bitnet group, there are two important
differences from Usenet.
<P>
First, when you want to post a message for others to read in the
discussion group, you send a message to the group name at its Bitnet
address.  Using Econet as an example, you would mail the message to:
<P>
<PRE>
econet@miamiu.bitnet
</PRE>
<P>
Note that this is different from the listserv address you used to
subscribe to the group to begin with.  Use the listserv address ONLY
to subscribe to or unsubscribe from a discussion group.  If you use the
discussion-group address to try to subscribe or unsubscribe, your message 
will go out to every other subscriber, many of whom will think unkind 
thoughts, which they may share with you in an e-mail message). 
<P>
The second difference relates to sending an e-mail message to the
author of a particular posting.  Usenet newsreaders such as rn and nn
let you do this with one key.  But if you hit your <SAMP>`R'</SAMP> key to respond to
a discussion-group message, your message will go to the listserver,
and from there to everybody else on the list!  This can prove
embarrassing to you and annoying to others. To make sure your
message goes just to the person who wrote the posting, take down his
e-mail address from the posting and then compose a brand-new message.
Remember, also, that if you see an e-mail address like
<TT>&lt;IZZY@INDYVMS&gt;</TT>, it's 
a Bitnet address. 
<P>
Two Bitnet lists will prove helpful for delving further into the
network.  NEW-LIST tells you the names of new discussion groups. To
subscribe, send a message to <TT>&lt;listserv@ndsuvm1.bitnet&gt;</TT>:
<P>
<PRE>
sub NEW-LIST Your Name
</PRE>
<P>
INFONETS is the place to go when you have questions about Bitnet.
It is also  first rate for help on questions about all major computer
networks and how to reach them.  To subscribe, send e-mail to
<TT>&lt;info-nets-request@think.com&gt;</TT>:
<P>
<PRE>
sub INFONETS Your Name
</PRE>
<P>
Both of these lists are also available on Usenet, the former as
<TT>bit.listserv.new-list</TT>; the latter as <TT>bit.listserv.infonets</TT>
(sometimes <TT>bit.listserv.info-nets</TT>).
<P>
<PRE>
<EM>"It wasn't long before the invention of the mailing-list, an
ARPANET broadcasting technique in which an identical message could
be sent automatically to large number of network subscribers.
Interestingly, one of the first really big mailing-list was "SF-LOVERS",
for Science Fiction fans. Disscussing science fiction on the network
was not work-related and was frowned upon by many ARPANET computer
administrators, but this didn't stop it from happening."</EM>

<P>
Like any large community, cyberspace has its libraries, places you
can go to look up information or take out a good book.  Telnet is one of
<A NAME="IDX246"></A>
<A NAME="IDX247"></A>
<A NAME="IDX248"></A>
your keys to these libraries.
<P>
<EM>Telnet</EM> is a program that lets you use the power of the Internet to
connect you to databases, library catalogs, and other information
resources around the world.  Want to see what the weather's like in
Vermont? Check on crop conditions in Azerbaijan? Get more information
about somebody whose name you've seen online? Telnet lets you do this,
and more.
<P>
Alas, there's a big "but!"  Unlike the phone system, Internet is not
yet universal;  not everybody can use all of its services.  Almost all
colleges and universities on the Internet provide telnet access.   So do
all of the for-fee public-access systems listed in
section <A HREF="bdg_8.html#SEC11">Ready, Set...</A>. But the 
Free-Net systems do not give you access to every telnet system.  And if 
you are using a public-access UUCP or Usenet site, you will not have 
access to telnet. The main reason for this is cost.  Connecting to the 
Internet can easily cost $1,000 or more for a leased, high-speed phone 
line. Some databases and file libraries can be queried by e-mail, 
however; we'll show you how to do that later on. In the meantime, the 
rest of this chapter assumes you are connected to a site with at least 
<A NAME="IDX249"></A>
<A NAME="IDX250"></A>
<A NAME="IDX251"></A>
<A NAME="IDX252"></A>
partial Internet access. 
<P>
Most telnet sites are fairly easy to use and have online help systems.
Most also work best (and in some cases, only) with VT100 emulation.
Let's dive right in and try one.
<P>
At your host system's command line, type
<P>
<PRE>
telnet access.usask.ca
<A NAME="IDX253"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  That's all you have to do to connect to a telnet site!
In this case, you'll be connecting to a service known as Hytelnet, which
is a database of computerized library catalogs and other databases
<A NAME="IDX254"></A>
available through telnet.  You should see something like this:
<P>

</PRE>
<P>
Every telnet site has two addresses -- one composed of words that
are easier for people to remember; the other a numerical address better
suited for computers.  The "escape character" is good to remember.  When
all else fails, hitting your control key and the <SAMP>`]'</SAMP> key at the same time
will disconnect you and return you to your host system.  At the login
prompt, type

</PRE>
<P>
The first choice, "&#60;WHATIS&#62;" will be highlighted.  Use your down
and up arrows to move the cursor among the choices.  Hit enter when you
decide on one.  You'll get another menu, which in turn will bring up
text files telling you how to connect to sites and giving any special
commands or instructions you might need.  Hytelnet does have one quirk.
To move back to where you started (for example, from a sub-menu to a
main menu), hit the left-arrow key on your computer.
<P>
Play with the system.  You might want to turn on your computer's
screen-capture, or at the very least, get out a pen and paper. You're
bound to run across some interesting telnet services that you'll want to
try -- and you'll need their telnet "addresses."
<P>
As you move around Hytelnet, it may seem as if you haven't left
your host system -- telnet can work that quickly.  Occasionally, when
network loads are heavy, however, you will notice a delay between the
time you type a command or enter a request and the time the remote
service responds.
<P>
To disconnect from Hytelnet and return to your system, hit your q
key and enter.
<P>
Some telnet computers are set up so that you can only access them
through a specific "port."  In those cases, you'll always see a number
after their name, for example:  <B>india.colorado.edu 13</B>. It's important to
include that number, because otherwise, you may not get in.
<P>
In fact, try the above address. Type
<P>
<PRE>
telnet india.colorado.edu 13
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  You should see something like this:
<P>

Several hundred libraries around the world, from the Snohomish 
Public Library in Washington State to the Library of Congress are now 
available to you through telnet. You can use Hytelnet to find their 
names, telnet addresses and use instructions. 
<P>
Why would you want to browse a library you can't physically get to?
Many libraries share books, so if yours doesn't have what you're looking
for, you can tell the librarian where he or she can get it.  Or if you live
in an area where the libraries are not yet online, you can use telnet to do
some basic bibliographic research before you head down to the local branch.
<P>
There are several different database programs in use by online
libraries.  Harvard's is one of the easier ones to use, so let's try it.
<P>
Telnet to <B>hollis.harvard.edu</B>.  When you connect, you'll see:

WELCOME TO HOLLIS
(Harvard OnLine Library Information System)

To begin, type one of the 2-character database codes listed below:

HU      Union Catalog of the Harvard libraries
OW      Catalog of Older Widener materials
LG      Guide to Harvard Libraries and Computing Resources

AI      Expanded Academic Index (selective 1987-1988, full 1989-  )
LR      Legal Resource Index (1980-  )
PA      PAIS International (1985-  )

To change databases from any place in HOLLIS, type CHOOSE followed by a
2-character database code, as in:    CHOOSE HU

For general help in using HOLLIS, type HELP.   For HOLLIS news, type
HELP NEWS.   For HOLLIS hours of operation, type HELP HOURS.

The first thing to notice is the name of the system: Hollis.
Librarians around the world seem to be inordinately found of cutesy,
anthropomorphized acronyms for their machines (not far from Harvard, the
librarians at Brandeis University came up with Library On-Line User
Information Service, or Louis; MIT has Barton).
<P>
If you want to do some general browsing, probably the best bet on the
Harvard system is to choose HU, which gets you access to their main
holdings, including those of its medical libraries.  Chose that, and you'll
see this:

<P>
Follow the simple log-in instructions. When you get a menu, type <SAMP>`72'</SAMP>
(even though that is not listed), which takes you to the Pikes Peak Library
District, which serves the city of Colorado Springs.
<P>
Several years ago, its librarians realized they could use their
database program not just for books but for cataloging city records and
community information, as well.  Today, if you want to look up municipal
ordinances or city records, you only have to type in the word you're
looking for and you'll get back cites of the relevant laws or decisions.
<P>
Carl will also connect you to the University of Hawaii library, which,
like the one in Colorado Springs, has more than just bibliographic material
online.  One of its features is an online Hawaiian almanac that can tell
you everything you ever wanted to know about Hawaiians, including the
number injured in boogie-board accidents each year (seven).

PENPages, run by Pennsylvania State University's College of
Agricultural Sciences, provides weekly world weather and crop reports
from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. These reports detail 
everything from the effect of the weather on palm trees in Malaysia to
the state of the Ukrainian wheat crop. Reports from Pennsylvania
country extension officers offer tips for improving farm life. One
database lists Pennsylvania hay distributors by county -- and rates
<A NAME="IDX255"></A>
the quality of their hay!
<P>
The service lets you search for information two different ways. A
menu system gives you quick access to reports that change frequently,
such as the weekly crop/weather reports. An index system lets you
search through several thousand online documents by keyword. At the
main menu, you can either browse through an online manual or choose
"PENPages," which puts you into the agriculture system.

The National Ham Radio Call-Sign Callbook lets you search for
American amateur operators by callsign, city, last name or Zip code. A
successful search will give you the ham's name, address, callsign,
age, type of license and when he or she got it. 
Telnet:  <B>callsign.cs.buffalo.edu 2000</B> or <B>ham.njit.edu 2000</B>.
When you connect, you tell the system how you want to search and
what you're looking for. For example, if you want to search for hams
by city, you would type
<P>
<PRE>
city city-name
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter (for example: <SAMP>`city Kankakee'</SAMP>).
<P>
Other search choices are "call" (after which you would type a
ham's call sign), "name," and "zip" (which you would follow with a Zip
code).  Be careful when searching for hams in a large city; there
doesn't seem to be anyway to shut off the list once it starts except
by using control-]. Otherwise, when done, type

<P>
Communications Canada, a Canadian government agency is developing
Conversational Hypertext Access Technology (CHAT), a system
to provide easy database access to
people with little or no computer experience, using what are known as
hypertext links.  Instead of cryptic computer commands, users type
questions in English.
<P>

<P>
You choose one of the three databases now online, one on AIDS, and
<A NAME="IDX258"></A>
then ask questions in English.
<P>
Ask the AIDS database, "When was AIDS first discovered?" and it
answers:
<P>
"The first case of AIDS in North America was diagnosed in 1979.
Before that, it existed in Africa, probably beginning in the 1950's.
AIDS was discovered in North America when a number of young men with a
history of homosexuality developed a rare type of cancer called
Kaposi's sarcoma."
<P>
Sometimes, you do have to rephrase your question. For example,
when asked "What is the link between AIDS and drug use?" the computer
responds:
<P>
"I know two things about drugs: the drugs that are used to treat
people with AIDS, and the risks that drug users have in getting AIDS.
Please ask about treatments or drug users."

<P>
The middle line tells you the date and exact Mountain Standard
Time, as determined by a federal atomic clock.
<P>
If you want a more philosophical approach to your time, the U.S.
Naval Observatory's Automated Data Service has copies of detailed
papers on such things as "the nature of time."  It also carries
information on how to buy a clock, along with arcana on such things as

"leap seconds."

<VAR>Unfortunately the unrestricted telnet "ads" account that has been
introduced at this place in previous release of this guide has been
restricted for priviledged users. But an alternative way has also been
set up.</VAR>
<P>
<VAR>Now, one has to use an e-mail query to get the information, so
the following info would have better gone into another
(see section <A HREF="bdg_212.html#SEC215">Advanced E-mail</A>) section, but for the "sake of history..."</VAR>
<P>
There is a new experimental mail server called "adsmail" on tycho.
It will send by return mail any of the ADS data files.
You can obtain a list of available files by sending e-mail to
<TT>&lt;adsmail@tycho&gt;</TT> with subject: <SAMP>`anything'</SAMP>. For example:
<P>
<PRE>
mail -s anything adsmail@tycho.usno.navy.mil
</PRE>
<P>
To obtain any pariticular ADS file, just send e-mail with the name of the 
command associated withe the file:
 
<PRE>
mail -s gpssy adsmail@tycho.usno.navy.mil
</PRE>
<P>
and in 10 minutes or less you will receive the requested file. This service
extends ADS access to people who normally cannot telnet to tycho. Note that
no password is required for e-mail service.

Itself a major Net access
point in the San Francisco area, the WELL is also a unique online
community that maintains dozens of conferences on every imaginable
topic (seven devoted just to the Grateful Dead).  WELL users are
intelligent and opinionated; discussions are often fast and furious.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation was basically started in a series
of online conversations on the WELL. Although it has a serious San
Francisco flavor, it has users from across the country (enough to
<A NAME="IDX275"></A>
<A NAME="IDX276"></A>
support both East Coast and Midwest conferences).
<P>
For its conferences, the WELL uses PicoSpan software, which
presents messages differently than rn or nn.   When you enter a
conference, you can call up a list of "topics."  Enter a topic number,
and all of the messages start scrolling down the screen, sort of like
the music on an old-fashioned player-piano.  There is some online
help, but new users are sent a written manual.
See section <A HREF="bdg_44.html#SEC47">Electronic Mail</A>
for information on access charges (one advantage to connecting to the WELL
through telnet is that unless you live in the Bay Area, it is likely
to be much cheaper than other access methods).

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Putting the Finger on Someone</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_127.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_129.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC131" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC131">Putting the Finger on Someone</A></H2>
<P>
Finger is a handy little program which lets you find out more about 
people on the Net -- and lets you tell others on the Net more about 
yourself. 
<P>
Finger uses the same concept as telnet or ftp. But it works with 
only one file, called .plan (yes, with a period in front).  This is a 
text file an Internet user creates with a text editor in his home 
directory.  You can put your phone number in there, tell a little bit 
about yourself, or write almost anything at all.
<P>
To finger somebody else's <TT>`.plan'</TT> file, type this at the command
<A NAME="IDX277"></A>
line:
<P>
<PRE>
finger email-address
</PRE>
<P>
where email-address is the person's e-mail address.  You'll get back a
display that shows the last time the person was online, whether
they've gotten any new mail since that time and what, if anything, is
in their <TT>`.plan'</TT> file.
Some people and institutions have come up with creative uses for
these <TT>`.plan'</TT> files, letting you do everything from checking the weather
in Massachusetts to getting the latest baseball standings.  Try
fingering these e-mail addresses:

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Finding Someone on the Net</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_128.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_130.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC132" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC132">Finding Someone on the Net</A></H2>
<P>
So you have a friend and you want to find out if he has an Internet 
account to which you can write?  The quickest way may be to just pick up 
the phone, call him and ask him.  Although there are a variety of "white 
pages" services available on the Internet, they are far from complete -- 
college students, users of commercial services such as CompuServe and 
many Internet public-access sites, and many others simply won't be 
listed.  Major e-mail providers are working on a universal directory 
<A NAME="IDX278"></A>
system, but that could be some time away.
<P>
In the meantime, a couple of "white pages" services might give you 
some leads, or even just entertain you as you look up famous people or 
long-lost acquaintances.
<P>
The whois directory provides names, e-mail and postal mail address 
and often phone numbers for people listed in it.  To use it, telnet to
<B>internic.net</B>.
No log-on is needed.  The quickest way to use it is to type
<P>
<PRE>
whois name
</PRE>
  
at the prompt, where "name" is the last name or organization name you're 
looking for.
<P>
Another service worth trying, especially since it seems to give 
beginners fewer problems, is the Knowbot Information Service reachable by 
<A NAME="IDX279"></A>
<A NAME="IDX280"></A>
telnet at <B>info.cnri.reston.va. us 185</B>.
Again, no log-on is needed.  This service actually searches through a 
variety of other "white pages" systems, including the user directory for 
<A NAME="IDX281"></A>
MCIMail.  To look for somebody, type
<P>
<PRE>
query name
</PRE>
<P>
<SAMP>`name'</SAMP> is the last name of the person you're looking for.  You can 
get details of other commands by hitting a question mark at the prompt.
<P>
You can also use the knowbot system by e-mail.  Start a message to
<TT>&lt;netaddress@info.cnri. reston.va.us&gt;</TT>
Leave the "subject:" line blank. As your message, write 
<SAMP>`query name'</SAMP>
for the simplest type of search.  If you want details on more complex
searches, add another line:
<SAMP>`man'</SAMP>
<P>
Apart from the previously mentioned methods, there exists a periodical
posting on Usenet entitled <I>How to find people's E-mail addresses</I>
<A NAME="IDX282"></A>
that is edited and maintained by <VAR>Jonathan I. Kamens</VAR>.
It lists several alternatives in order of success probability, to enable
everybody to find everyone.
<P>
Just get <TT>`/pub/usenet/news.answers/finding-addresses'</TT>
from <B>rtfm.mit.edu</B>. See section <A HREF="bdg_132.html#SEC135">FTP (Mining the Net, part II)</A> to find out how to access this
server. It's cross-posted each month to
<TT>comp.mail.misc</TT>,
<TT>soc.net-people</TT>,
<TT>news.newusers.questions</TT>, and the respective <TT>*.answers</TT>
newsgroups.
<P>
The most interesting way described therein is a
way to search via the Usenet name server. This is a 
system at MIT that keeps track of the e-mail addresses of everybody who 
posts a Usenet message that appears at MIT.
It works by e-mail.  Send a message to 
<TT>&lt;mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu&gt;</TT>.
You can leave the <SAMP>`Subject:'</SAMP> line blank. As your message, write
<SAMP>`send usenet-addresses/lastname'</SAMP>
where "lastname" is the last name of the person you're looking for.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Tons of Files</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_132.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_134.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC136" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC136">Tons of Files</A></H2>
<P>
Hundreds of systems connected to Internet have file libraries, or
archives, accessible to the public. Much of this consists of free or low-
cost shareware programs for virtually every make of computer.  If you 
want a different communications program for your IBM, or feel like 
playing a new game on your Amiga, you'll be able to get it from the Net. 
<P>
But there are also libraries of documents as well.  If you
want a copy of a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision, you can find it on
the Net.  Copies of historical documents, from the Magna Carta to the
Declaration of Independence are also yours for the asking, along with a
translation of a telegram from Lenin ordering the execution of
rebellious peasants.  You can also find song lyrics, poems, even
summaries of every "Lost in Space" episode ever made.  You can also find
extensive files detailing everything you could ever possibly want to know
about the Net itself.  First you'll see how to get these files; then
we'll show you where they're kept.
<P>
The commonest way to get these files is through the file transfer
protocol, or ftp.  As with telnet, not all systems that connect to the
Net have access to ftp.  However, if your system is one of these, you'll
be able to get many of these files through e-mail (see section <A HREF="bdg_212.html#SEC215">Advanced E-mail</A>).
<P>
Starting ftp is as easy as using telnet. At your host system's command
line, type
<P>
<PRE>
ftp site.name
<A NAME="IDX288"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter, where "site.name" is the address of the ftp site you want
to reach.  One major difference between telnet and ftp is that it is
considered bad form to connect to most ftp sites during their business
hours (generally 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. local time).  This is because
transferring files across the network takes up considerable computing
power, which during the day is likely to be needed for whatever the
computer's main function is.  There are some ftp sites that are
accessible to the public 24 hours a day, though.  You'll find these noted
in the list of ftp sites (see section <A HREF="bdg_138.html#SEC141">Some Interesting FTP Sites</A>).

<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_133.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_135.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC137" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC137">Your Friend Archie</A></H2>
Until a few years ago, this could be quite the pain -- there was
no master directory to tell you where a given file might be stored on
the Net. Who'd want to slog through hundreds of file libraries looking
for something?
<P>
<VAR>Alan Emtage</VAR>, <VAR>Bill Heelan</VAR> and <VAR>Peter Deutsch</VAR>,
students at McGill University in Montreal, asked the same question.
<A NAME="IDX289"></A>
<A NAME="IDX290"></A>
<A NAME="IDX291"></A>
Unlike the weather, though, they did something about it.
<P>
They created a database system, called archie, that would
periodically call up file libraries and basically find out what they had
available. In turn, anybody could dial into archie, type in a file name, and
see where on the Net it was available. Archie currently catalogs close to
<A NAME="IDX292"></A>
1,000 file libraries around the world.
<P>
Today, there are three ways to ask archie to find a file for you:
through telnet, a "client" Archie program on your own host system or e-mail.
All three methods let you type in a full or partial file name and
will tell you where on the Net it's stored.
If you have access to telnet, you can telnet to one of the following
addresses: <B>archie.mcgill.ca</B>; <B>archie.sura.net</B>;
<B>archie.unl.edu</B>;
<B>archie.ans.net</B>; or <B>archie.rutgers.edu</B>.
If asked for a log-in name, type
<P>
<PRE>
archie
<A NAME="IDX293"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.
<P>
When you connect, the key command is prog, which you use in this
form:
<P>
<PRE>
prog filename
</PRE>
<P>
followed by enter, where "filename" is the program or file you're
looking for. If you're unsure of a file's complete name, try typing in
part of the name. For example, <TT>`PKZIP'</TT> will work as well as
<TT>`PKZIP204.EXE'</TT>.  The system does not support DOS or Unix wildcards.
If you ask archie to look for <TT>`PKZIP*'</TT>, it will tell you it couldn't
find anything by that name.  One thing to keep in mind is that a file is
not necessarily the same as a program -- it could also be a document.
This means you can use archie to search for, say, everything online
related to the Beatles, as well as computer programs and graphics files.
<P>
A number of Net sites now have their own archie programs that
take your request for information and pass it onto the nearest archie
database -- ask your system administrator if s/he has it online. These 
"client" programs seem to provide information a lot more quickly than the
actual archie itself!  If it is available, at your host system's command
line, type
<P>
<PRE>
archie -s filename
<A NAME="IDX294"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
where filename is the program or document you're looking for, and hit
enter.  The <SAMP>`-s'</SAMP> tells the program to ignore case in a file name and lets
you search for partial matches. You might actually want to type it this
way:
<P>
<PRE>
archie -s filename |more
</PRE>
<P>
which will stop the output every screen (handy if there are many sites
that carry the file you want).  Or you could open a file on your computer
with your text-logging function.
<P>
The third way, for people without access to either of the above, is e-mail.
<P>
Send a message to <TT>&lt;archie@quiche.cs.mcgill.ca&gt;</TT>. You can leave the
subject line blank.  Inside the message, type
<P>
<PRE>
prog filename
</PRE>
<P>
where filename is the file you're looking for.  You can ask archie to
look up several programs by putting their names on the same "prog" line, 
like this:
<P>
<PRE>
prog file1 file2 file3
</PRE>
<P>
Within a few hours, archie will write back with a list of the
appropriate sites.
<P>
In all three cases, if there is a system that has your file,
you'll get a response that looks something like this:
<P>
<PRE>
Host sumex-aim.stanford.edu

Location: /info-mac/comm
FILE -rw-r--r--     258256  Feb 15 17:07  zterm-09.hqx
Location: /info-mac/misc
FILE -rw-r--r--       7490  Sep 12 1991   zterm-sys7-color-icons.hqx
</PRE>
<P>
Chances are, you will get a number of similar looking responses
for each program.  The "Host" is the system that has the file.  The
"Location" tells you which directory to look in when you connect to
that system.  Ignore the funny-looking collections of r's and hyphens
for now.  After them come the size of the file or directory listing
in bytes, the date it was uploaded, and the name of the file.
<P>
Now you want to get that file.

Assuming your host site does have ftp, you connect in a similar
fashion to telnet, by typing:
<P>
<PRE>
ftp sumex-aim.stanford.edu
</PRE>
<P>
(or the name of whichever site you want to reach). Hit enter.  If the
connection works, you'll see this:
<P>
<PRE>
Connected to sumex-aim.stanford.edu.
220 SUMEX-AIM FTP server (Version 4.196 Mon Jan 13 13:52:23 PST 1992) ready.

</PRE>
<P>
If nothing happens after a minute or so, hit control-C to return
to your host system's command line.  But if it has worked, type
<P>
<PRE>
anonymous
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  You'll see a lot of references on the Net to
"anonymous ftp." This is how it gets its name -- you don't really have
to tell the library site what your name is. The reason is that these
sites are set up so that anybody can gain access to certain public
files, while letting people with accounts on the sites to log on and
access their own personal files.  Next, you'll be asked for your 
password.  As a password, use your e-mail address.  This will then come
up:

<P>
Now type

ftp&#62;
</PRE>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX295"></A>
Ack! Let's decipher this Rosetta Stone.
<P>
First, ls is the ftp command for displaying a directory (you can
actually use dir as well, but if you're used to MS-DOS, this could lead
to confusion when you try to use dir on your host system, where it won't
work, so it's probably better to just remember to always use ls for a
directory while online).
<P>
The very first letter on each line tells you whether the listing is
for a directory or a file. If the first letter is a <SAMP>`d'</SAMP>, or an <SAMP>`l'</SAMP>,
it's a directory. Otherwise, it's a file.
<P>
The rest of that weird set of letters and dashes consist of "flags"
that tell the ftp site who can look at, change or delete the file. You
can safely ignore it. You can also ignore the rest of the line until you
get to the second number, the one just before the date. This tells you
how large the file is, in bytes. If the line is for a directory, the
number gives you a rough indication of how many items are in that
directory  -- a directory listing of 512 bytes is relatively small. Next
comes the date the file or directory was uploaded, followed (finally!) by
its name.
<P>
Notice the <TT>`README.POSTING'</TT> file up at the top of the directory. Most
archive sites have a "read me" document, which usually contains some
basic information about the site, its resources and how to use them.
Let's get this file, both for the information in it and to see how to
transfer files from there to here. At the <SAMP>`ftp&#62;'</SAMP> prompt, type
<P>
<PRE>
get README.POSTING
<A NAME="IDX296"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter. Note that ftp sites are no different from Unix sites in
general: they are case-sensitive. You'll see something like this:
<P>
<PRE>
200 PORT command successful.
150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for README.POSTING (4444 bytes).
226 Transfer complete. 4444 bytes received in 1.177 seconds (3.8 Kbytes/s)
</PRE>
<P>
And that's it! The file is now located in your home directory on your host
system, from which you can now download it to your own computer. The
simple <SAMP>`get'</SAMP> command is the key to transferring a file from an archive
<A NAME="IDX297"></A>
site to your host system.
<P>
If you want to download more than one file at a time (say a series
<A NAME="IDX298"></A>
of documents), use <SAMP>`mget'</SAMP> instead of <SAMP>`get'</SAMP>; for example:
<P>
<PRE>
mget *.txt
</PRE>
<P>
This will transfer copies of every file ending with <TT>`.txt'</TT> in the given
directory.  Before each file is copied, you'll be asked if you're sure
you want it.  Despite this, mget could still save you considerable
time -- you won't have to type in every single file name. If you want to
save even more time, and are sure you really want <EM>all</EM> of the
<A NAME="IDX299"></A>
given files, type <SAMP>`prompt'</SAMP>
before you do the mget command. This will turn off the prompt, and all 
the files will be zapped right into your home directory.
<P>
There is one other command to keep in mind.  If you want to get a
copy of a computer program, type
<P>
<PRE>
bin
<A NAME="IDX300"></A>
<A NAME="IDX301"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  This tells the ftp site and your host site that you are
sending a binary file, i.e., a program.  Most ftp sites now use binary
format as a default, but it's a good idea to do this in case you've
connected to one of the few that doesn't.
<P>
To switch to a directory, type
<P>
<PRE>
cd directory-name
<A NAME="IDX302"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
(substituting the name of the directory you want to access) and hit
enter. Type
<P>
<PRE>
ls
<A NAME="IDX303"></A>
<A NAME="IDX304"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter to get the file listing for that particular directory.
To move back up the directory tree, type
<P>
<PRE>
cd ..
</PRE>
<P>
(note the space between the d and the first period) and hit enter.  Or
you could type
<P>
<PRE>
cdup
<A NAME="IDX305"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  Keep doing this until you get to the directory of
interest.  Alternately, if you already know the directory path of the
file you want (from our friend archie), after you connect, you could
simply type
<P>
<PRE>
get directory/subdirectory/filename
</PRE>
<P>
On many sites, files meant for public consumption are in the pub
or public directory; sometimes you'll see an info directory.
<P>
Almost every site has a bin directory, which at first glance
sounds like a bin in which interesting stuff might be dumped.  But it
actually stands for "binary" and is simply a place for the system
administrator to store the programs that run the ftp system. Lost+found
is another directory that looks interesting but actually never has
anything of public interest in them.
<P>
Before, you saw how to use archie.  From our example, you can see
that some system administrators go a little berserk when naming files.
Fortunately, there's a way for you to rename the file as it's being
transferred. Using our archie example, you'd type
<P>
<PRE>
get zterm-sys7-color-icons.hqx zterm.hqx
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  Instead of having to deal constantly with a file called
<TT>`zterm-sys7-color-icons. hqx'</TT>, you'll now have one called, simply,
<TT>`zterm.hqx'</TT>.
<P>
Those last three letters bring up something else: Many program files
are compressed to save on space and transmission time.  In order to
actually use them, you'll have to use an un-compress program on them first.

<H2><A NAME="SEC139" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC139">Odd Letters -- Decoding File Endings</A></H2>
There are a wide variety of compression methods in use.  You can 
tell which method was used by the last one to three letters at the end of 
a file. Here are some of the more common ones and what you'll need to un-
compress the files they create (most of these decompression programs can 
all be located through archie).
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX306"></A>
<DT><CODE>.txt</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX307"></A>
<DT><CODE>.TXT</CODE>
<DD>By itself, this means the file is a document, rather than a
program.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX308"></A>
<DT><CODE>.ps</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX309"></A>
<DT><CODE>.PS</CODE>
<DD>A PostScript document (in Adobe's page description language).
You can print this file on any PostScript capable printer, or use a
<A NAME="IDX310"></A>
<A NAME="IDX311"></A>
<A NAME="IDX312"></A>
<A NAME="IDX313"></A>
previewer, like GNU project's GhostScript.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX314"></A>
<DT><CODE>.doc</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX315"></A>
<DT><CODE>.DOC</CODE>
<DD>Is another common suffix for documents. No
de-compression is needed, unless it is followed by
<P>
<A NAME="IDX316"></A>
<A NAME="IDX317"></A>
<A NAME="IDX318"></A>
<DT><CODE>.z</CODE>
<DD>A file compressed by the Unix <CODE>pack</CODE> utility.  It uses Huffman coding
(which minimizes redundancy) on each byte.  Type <SAMP>`unpack filename.z'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`gunzip filename.z'</SAMP> to decompress it.  This suffix was also briefly used
to indicate gzip'ed files before <SAMP>`.gz'</SAMP> was adopted.
However, some sites <EM>still</EM> use this suffix for gzip'ed files, e.g.
the EFF's FTP-server, due to local set-ups.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX319"></A>
<A NAME="IDX320"></A>
<A NAME="IDX321"></A>
<A NAME="IDX322"></A>
<A NAME="IDX323"></A>
<DT><CODE>.Z</CODE>
<DD>This is a Unix compression method.  To uncompress the file,
type <SAMP>`uncompress filename.Z'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`gunzip filename.Z'</SAMP>
and hit enter at your host system's command prompt. If it's a
text file, you can read it online by typing
<SAMP>`zcat file.txt.Z |more'</SAMP>
at your host system's command line. There is a Macintosh
<TT>`u16.zip'</TT> is an MS-DOS program that will let you download 
such a file and uncompress it on your own computer. The
Macintosh equivalent program is called MacCompress (use
archie to find these).
<P>
<A NAME="IDX324"></A>
<DT><CODE>.zip</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX325"></A>
<DT><CODE>.ZIP</CODE>
<DD>These indicate the file has been compressed with a common
MS-DOS compression program, known as PKZIP (use archie to
find <TT>`PKZIP204.EXE'</TT>).  Many Unix systems will let you un-ZIP
<A NAME="IDX326"></A>
a file with a program called, well, unzip.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX327"></A>
<A NAME="IDX328"></A>
<A NAME="IDX329"></A>
<DT><CODE>.gz</CODE>
<DD>The GNU project's compression format. A variant of the PKZIP
<A NAME="IDX330"></A>
format. Use <SAMP>`gunzip filename.gz'</SAMP> to uncompress.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX331"></A>
<DT><CODE>.zoo</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX332"></A>
<DT><CODE>.ZOO</CODE>
<DD>A Unix, VAX and MS-DOS format. Requires the use of a program
<A NAME="IDX333"></A>
called zoo to uncompress.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX334"></A>
<DT><CODE>.Hqx</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX335"></A>
<DT><CODE>.hqx</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX336"></A>
A Macintosh format that needs BinHex for de-coding.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX337"></A>
<DT><CODE>.shar</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX338"></A>
<DT><CODE>.Shar</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX339"></A>
<A NAME="IDX340"></A>
A Unix format. Use unshar.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX341"></A>
<DT><CODE>.tar</CODE>
<DD>Another Unix format, often used to glue several related
files and/or complete directory trees into one big file.
Use the <SAMP>`tar'</SAMP> command.  Often, a "tarred" file
will also be compressed with the <SAMP>`.Z'</SAMP>/<SAMP>`.gz'</SAMP> method, so you first have
<A NAME="IDX342"></A>
<A NAME="IDX343"></A>
<A NAME="IDX344"></A>
to use <SAMP>`uncompress'</SAMP>/<SAMP>`gunzip'</SAMP> and then <SAMP>`tar'</SAMP>.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX345"></A>
<DT><CODE>.TAZ</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX346"></A>
<DT><CODE>.TGZ</CODE>
<DD>Sometimes used for compressed tar archives <TT>`.tar.Z'</TT>, that are
stored on "3 letter suffix only systems" (aka MS-DOS).
<P>
<A NAME="IDX347"></A>
<DT><CODE>.sit</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX348"></A>
<DT><CODE>.Sit</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX349"></A>
A Macintosh format, requires StuffIt.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX350"></A>
<DT><CODE>.ARC</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX351"></A>
<A NAME="IDX352"></A>
A DOS format that requires the use of ARC or ARCE.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX353"></A>
<DT><CODE>.LZH</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX354"></A>
Another DOS compression format; requires the use of LHARC.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX355"></A>
<DT><CODE>.lz</CODE>
<DD><A NAME="IDX356"></A>
<DT><CODE>.lha</CODE>
<DD>The Amiga variant of LHARC. It's the most common Amiga archiving method,
<A NAME="IDX357"></A>
<A NAME="IDX358"></A>
and made with the program <CODE>lha</CODE> or <CODE>lz</CODE>.
</DL>
<P>
A few last words of caution: Check the size of a file before you get 
it. The Net moves data at phenomenal rates of speed.  But that 500,000-byte
file that gets transferred to your host system in a few seconds 
could take more than an hour or two to download to your computer if 
you're using a 2400-baud modem.  Your host system may also have limits on 
the amount of bytes you can store online at any one time.  Also, although 
it is really extremely unlikely you will ever get a file infected with a 
virus, if you plan to do much downloading over the Net, you'd be wise to 
<A NAME="IDX359"></A>
invest in a good anti-viral program, just in case.

<P>
System administrators are like everybody else -- they try to make
things easier for themselves.  And when you sit in front of a keyboard
all day, that can mean trying everything possible to reduce the number
of keys you actually have to hit each day.
<P>
Unfortunately, that can make it difficult for the rest of us.
<P>
You've already read about <TT>`bin'</TT> and <TT>`lost+found'</TT> directories,
<TT>`etc'</TT> is 
another seemingly interesting directory that turns out to be another 
place to store files used by the ftp site itself.  Again, nothing of any
real interest.
<P>
Then, once you get into the actual file libraries, you'll find that
in many cases, files will have such non-descriptive names as
<TT>`V1.1-AK.TXT'</TT>.
The best known example is probably a set of several hundred
files known as RFCs, which provide the basic technical and
organizational information on which much of the Internet is built.
These files can be found on many ftp sites, but always in a form such as
<TT>`RFC101.TXT'</TT>, <TT>`RFC102.TXT'</TT> and so on, with no clue whatsoever
as to what information they contain.
<P>
Fortunately, almost all ftp sites have a "Rosetta Stone" to help
you decipher these names.  Most will have a file named <TT>`README'</TT> (or some
variant) that gives basic information about the system.  Then, most
directories will either have a similar <TT>`README'</TT> file or will have an index
that does give brief descriptions of each file.  These are usually the
first file in a directory and often are in the form <TT>`00INDEX.TXT'</TT>.  Use
the ftp command to get this file.  You can then scan it online or
<A NAME="IDX360"></A>
download it to see which files you might be interested in.
<P>
Another file you will frequently see is called <TT>`ls-lgR.Z'</TT>.  This contains
a listing of every file on the system, but without any descriptions (the
name comes from the Unix command <SAMP>`ls -lgR'</SAMP>, which gives you a listing of all
the files in all your directories).  The <SAMP>`.Z'</SAMP> at the end means the file has
been compressed, which means you will have to use a Unix un-compress command
before you can read the file.
<P>
And finally, we have those system administrators who almost seem to
delight in making things difficult -- the ones who take full advantage of
Unix's ability to create absurdly long file names.  On some FTP sites, you
will see file names as long as 80 characters or so, full of capital letters,
underscores and every other orthographic device that will make it almost
impossible for you to type the file name correctly when you try to get it.
Your secret weapon here is the mget command.  Just type mget, a space, and
the first five or six letters of the file name, followed by an asterisk, for
example:
<P>
<PRE>
mget This_F*
</PRE>
<P>
The FTP site will ask you if you want to get the file that begins with that
name. If there are several files that start that way, you might have to
answer <SAMP>`n'</SAMP> a few times, but it's still easier than trying to recreate a
ludicrously long file name.

What follows is a list of some interesting ftp sites, arranged by

barely scratches the surface of what is available.  Liberal use of archie
will help you find specific files.

The times listed for each site are in Eastern time and represent
the periods during which it is considered acceptable to connect.

The <TT>`pub/usenet/rec.arts.books'</TT> directory has
reading lists for various authors as well as lists of recommended
bookstores in different cities.  Unfortunately, this site uses incredibly
long file names -- so long they may scroll off the end of your screen if
you are using an MS-DOS or certain other computers.  Even if you want
just one of the files, it probably makes more sense to use mget than get.
This way, you will be asked on each file whether you want to get it;
otherwise you may wind up frustrated because the system will keep telling
you the file you want doesn't exist (since you may miss the end of its
name due to the scrolling problem).
