CREATING SEXUAL TENSION</h2>

<p>
The Clinton Administration's women-in-combat policy has created
an atmosphere which may make it difficult for officers to comply
with combat-related military service.  The recent case of Navy
helicopter pilot Lieutenant Commander Ken Carkhuff illustrates
the unfortunate turn that the pursuit of a gender-blind military
may be taking for the US Navy and for those who object to the
policy. 
<P>
On August 24, 1994, Carkhuff told his executive officer, &quot;I
cannot take this detachment to sea.&quot;  The detachment included
two female pilots, and Carkhuff later explained, &quot;I could
not appear to endorse a policy [the women-in-combat policy] that
I didn't agree with.&quot; Carkhuff's statement disqualified him
from leading his detachment. His commander relieved him of his
duties and two officer boards have concluded that Carkhuff should
be honorably discharged from the service.[1]
<P>
Carkhuff told the &quot;show cause&quot; board on May 18, 1995,
&quot;I think that we should not be subjecting... women to violence,
and there is no more extreme violence that a human can be involved
in than in combat.&quot;[2]  He said that he was not anxious to confront
the policy and stated that he had no objection to women serving
in the Navy.[3]
<P>
Carkhuff had, in fact, just completed a year at the Naval War
College where the issue of women in combat was debated extensively.
 He had strong and religiously-based views on this issue.  The
day he privately stated his view to his boss corresponded to the
birth of his fifth child, a daughter.  Carkhuff feared that leading
women into a possible combat situation [the US invasion of Haiti
was weeks away] would incrementally lead to expanded combat roles
for women and perhaps his own daughter's forced combat role in
the future.
<P>
Commander Carkhuff did state at the hearing that &quot;if ordered
to execute that policy, I will do it.&quot;[4]  Nevertheless, the
Navy stood by its decision to discharge him honorably.
<P>
This case raises questions about a double standard at work in
the Navy on the issue of voicing personal opinions about women
in combat.  In 1992, uniformed female Navy officers gathered on
Capitol Hill to lobby against the female combat 
ban, labeling it an &quot;equal opportunity issue.&quot;  The
Navy ignored regulations which restrict uniformed sailors from
personal lobbying and did not discipline these officers.  However,
Carkhuff's private protest resulted in an honorable discharge.
 This would demonstrate that violations committed while protesting
in support of women in combat are ignored, while those protests
against the policy of women in combat are punished.
<P>
More importantly, this case raises questions about whether the
Navy is in danger of losing good men due to its women-in-combat
policy.  Carkhuff was a proven officer with consistently high
performance ratings.  Assuming there are other exemplary men who,
because of such policies, will cut short their military careers,
the military does not profit.  Nor does it profit from the fact
that this policy may discourage some would-be &quot;top guns&quot;
from responding to recruitment appeals to pursue a military career.
<P>
The Clinton Administration has erased more than 250,000 combat
exemptions for women.  Today, women can be assigned to 95 percent
of all Navy billets.  Feminists say this is progress, but combat
veterans and our combat-hardened allies know this portends disaster.
 In fact, the Navy's policy of women in combat is contrary to
the findings of the 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment
of Women in the Armed Forces.
<P>
The board reviewing Carkhuff did not find that Carkhuff lacked
the ability to perform.  According to Navy documents, he is being
honorably separated for disagreeing with a politically sensitive
policy, and for refusing to perform a duty.
<P>
When officers so strongly protest, it is time for the Pentagon
and Congress to reconsider the wisdom of policies that increase
the combat role of women.  Men like Carkhuff deserve the opportunity
to honorably serve, rather than have their careers cut short by
an unfortunate and dangerous policy.

<title>MARRIAGE PROTECTS WOMEN FROM VIOLENCE</title>

<h2>MARRIAGE PROTECTS WOMEN<br>
FROM VIOLENCE</h2>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>
Studies and pronouncements about violence against women continue
to make headlines.  Recently, the Justice Department announced
that a redesigned national survey found that violence against
women is much higher than previously reported.  The survey also
reveals that marriage often shields women from violence.  
<P>
Any violence against women should be strongly condemned, and offenders
should be punished to the full extent of the law.   But some feminists
exaggerate the real scope of this tragic problem using unvetted
advocacy research.   Consider some advocacy reporting:
<UL>
<LI>&quot;There are three to four million women beaten by husbands
or lovers every year; that's one every 15 seconds.&quot;  (<I>Chicago
Tribune</I>, February 10, 1992)
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>&quot;Four million to six million women are beaten [each year].
 That means once every five seconds...a woman is punched or kicked...or
held down and pummeled.&quot;  (Associated Press)[1]
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Miami talk-show host Pat Stevens told a <I>Crossfire</I> audience
that 60 million women are abused every year.[2]
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>Ms</I>. magazine's &quot;Campus Project on Sexual Assault&quot;
claims that 15.4 percent of college women are raped and 12.1 percent
experience an attempted rape each year.[3]
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>When President Clinton named Bonnie Campbell to head the &quot;Violence
Against Women&quot; office at the Justice Department, he said
there are 700,000 rapes or attempted rapes every year.[4]
</UL>
<P>
<P>
The bases for these &quot;facts&quot; are seldom given and they
should be suspect.  After all, there are 31,536,000 seconds in
a year.  If an American woman is victimized every 15 seconds,
then there are in reality 2,124,000 incidents.  Five million violent
female victimizations would be one every 6.3 seconds.
<P>
The August, 1995 Bureau of Justice Statistics study, &quot;Violence
Against Women: Estimates from the Redesigned Survey,&quot; provides
a different, although, sobering picture.[5]
Men are far more likely to be victims of crime (64.9 v. 43.7 per
1,000 persons) than women.[6]   But women are nine times more likely
than men to become rape/sexual assault victims.[7]   That figure
is higher than previously reported.
<P>
The new survey estimates there are 500,200 female victimizations
each year which includes 172,400 completed rapes and 141,200 attempted
rapes.[8]  In comparison, the FBI previously reported 109,062 forcible
rapes for 1992, which was a 38.2 percent rise in the total number
of reported rapes and a 27 percent rate increase since 1973.[9]
<P>
The study is based on the redesigned National Crime Victimization
Survey (NCVS) which is a continuous nationally representative
sample of 50,000 households.  The latest report includes the years
1992-1993 and with revised questions it found that the average
annual rate of violent victimization per 1,000 women rose from
5.4 in 1987-91 to 9.4.[10]
<P>
The woman's relationship to the offender is a key variable.  The
1995 study found that a woman is three times more likely to be
raped or sexually assaulted by a boyfriend and 10 times more likely
to be raped or sexually assaulted by an acquaintance thanby a
spouse.  Single women are just as likely to be raped or sexually
assaulted by a stranger as they are by a boyfriend.[11]
<P>
When all acts of violence against women are considered, married
or widowed women are 30 times less likely than separated women
to become violence victims.  Married women are at least four times
less likely than never-married women to be crime victims.[12]
<P>
The study also found that women aged 19-29 are the most likely
violence victims.  They are twice as likely to become victims
as 30 to 45 year old women and 12 to 18 year old girls.[13]  Although
the Justice Department report does not explain the difference,
U.S. Census Bureau statistics show that the older female cohort
tends to be married and the younger cohort is more likely to live
in homes where there is a protecting father.[14]
<P>
Family income also makes a big difference.  Women from middle
income families tend to be four times safer than those from families
with incomes under $10,000.  Education, ethnicity and race are
not major violence discriminators.[15]
<P>
<center><h3>CONCLUSIONS ABOUT VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN</h3></center>
<P>
Incidents of rape and sexual assault are officially higher than
previously reported but do not come close to the figures offered
by some advocacy researchers.  Based on the new survey it's too
early to determine whether violence against women is rising. 
But it's clear that the offender/victim relationship is key and
deserves more attention.
<P>
Young women (19-29 years old), who have never married (or are
separated) and have low incomes are most vulnerable to violence.
 Their offenders are more likely to be known to them, and crime
by non-strangers usually occurs at or near the woman's home. 
<P>
The survey shows that marriage protects all female cohorts from
every type of violence.  Married women are safer than single,
separated, divorced and never-married women.    
<P>
Marriage also reduces violent crime incidents among men.  It helps
to channel male aggression toward positive goals.  Never-married
men are more likely to commit assault and they suffer most (58.9
percent) assaults.[16]  They are also five times more likely to rape
and commit other violent crime than married men.[17]
<P>
The Justice Department's latest report should encourage government
to harness marriage as a shield against violence.  The report
also tells American women and girls that the safest place today
is living in homes with their husbands and fathers.

<title>THE STRAIGHT STORY ON NEW JERSEY</title>

<h2>THE STRAIGHT STORY<br>

BIRTHS, ABORTIONS, AND THE FAMILY CAP</h2>

<p>
In August of 1993, the first &quot;family cap&quot; in the nation
took effect in the state of New Jersey as part of a larger package
of reforms known as the Family Development Program.  The family
cap provision stipulates that a mother who has already received
welfare benefits for at least 10 months and who bears an additional
child will receive no increase in her basic monthly AFDC benefit.
 The provision affects only the monthly <I>cash</I> benefit, however.
 Health benefits and food stamps continue to increase with family
size.
<P>
The raw numbers of births and abortions in New Jersey since the
cap took effect strongly suggest that the policy has reduced the
number of births to AFDC mothers without affecting the abortion
rate.
<P>
Raw data for the 20-month period from August 1992 to March 1994

<P>
The total number of abortions in the year before the policy took
effect was 11,817, yielding a monthly average of 984.75.  In the
eight months after the policy took effect (including March 1994,
which had a far higher total of abortions than any other month
on record), the total number of abortions was 7,932, yielding
a monthly average of 991.5.  The difference (0.7%) is trivial
and well within the expected range of random fluctuation.  If
the anomalous month of March were excluded from the analysis,
the average would be just 953 abortions per month after the introduction
of the family cap -- a 3% decline from the previous year's average,
but also trivial enough to be within the range of random fluctuation.
<P>
A more comprehensive look at the data reduces the significance
of the difference even further.  The average monthly caseload
in the year before the family cap was enacted was 121,479.  In
the eight months post-cap, the average monthly caseload was 122,679
-- a difference of less than 1%.  But the monthly abortion rate
(number of abortions per 1,000 AFDC cases) was 8.11 in the year
prior to enactment of the family cap and only 8.08 in the eight
months post-enactment.  The difference is too small to be statistically
significant, but it is worth noting that the total number of abortions
in the period after implementation of the cap was three <I>fewer</I>
than predicted by the rate before enactment of the policy.
<P>
Using the entire preceding year as the baseline, however, tends
to distort the real effect of the family cap because the abortion
rate was very low in the period ranging from August to November
1992.  During the eight months immediately preceding the introduction
of the cap (December 1992 to July 1993), New Jersey welfare mothers
underwent 8,144 abortions -- 212 <I>more</I> than in the eight
months after the cap took effect.  If the post-cap data did not
include the month of March 1994, moreover, the post-cap abortion
average would have been 8% less than the average for the previous
seven months.
<P>
No responsible statistician would therefore conclude that the
family cap must reduce abortions.  But an honest evaluation of
the available data strongly argues that, contrary to the fears
expressed by many in the pro-life community, the family cap has
had no impact on the number or rate of abortions among New Jersey's
AFDC recipients.  The monthly abortion totals fluctuated with
no apparent pattern, but were always within the expected range.
 The total number of abortions in the eight months post-cap was
almost exactly what would have been projected if there had been
no change in the state's welfare policy.
<P>
The birth rate among AFDC recipients, on the other hand, was significantly
lower after introduction of the family cap.  In the year prior
to the cap, the total number of births to welfare mothers in New
Jersey was 15,972, yielding a monthly average of 1,331 births
and a monthly rate of 10.96 births per thousand AFDC recipients.
 In the eight months post-cap, there were 9,519 births, yielding
a monthly average of 1,190 births and a monthly rate of 9.70 births
per thousand AFDC recipients.  The difference is consistent, substantial,
and statistically significant.
<P>
In all eight months after the introduction of the cap, the birth
totals were below the previous year's average and lower than the
total for the corresponding month in the previous year.  The monthly
abortion totals after implementation of the cap show a more random
pattern.  In six of the eight months, there were fewer abortions
than the previous year's average, but in only three of those months
was the abortion total lower than the total for the corresponding
month the year before.
<P>
When the entire 20-month period is divided into 4-month increments
(see Table 2), the change in the average number of births is obvious.
 The family cap has produced a significant reduction in the number
of births and pregnancies, but has had no discernible impact on
the number of abortions.

The only way to calculate a higher abortion rate for the post-cap
period is to suppress the data from April to July 1993 -- the
period immediately prior to implementation of the new policy --
and compare the abortion totals from the post-cap period with
the totals from the corresponding months of the previous year.
 <I>Unless the April to July 1993 data is suppressed, </I>the
abortion rate after implementation of the family cap appears to
be either the same as or lower than the abortion rate before the
cap.
<P>
There are only two hypotheses that could justify suppressing the
April to July 1993 data and preserve the finding that the abortion
rate has increased since implementation of the cap.
<P>
First, it is possible that the abortion rate follows an annual
cyclical pattern and that the monthly abortion totals from April
to July 1994 will show the same inflation as in 1993.  But a close
examination of the month-by-month totals suggests that the high
months and low months in the two years do not correspond with
enough consistency to indicate a seasonal cycle.  In 1992-1993,
the months with high abortion totals were October, January, and
March, while August, November, and December registered low totals.
 In 1993-1994, August and March were the months with a high number
of abortions, and the September total was relatively low.
<P>
The second hypothesis is that welfare mothers may have staged
an &quot;abortion rush&quot; prior to implementation of the family
cap, thereby generating unusually high abortion totals in the
months immediately preceding the change in policy.  But the single
month in which an &quot;abortion rush&quot; would have been most
visible, July 1993, had a lower abortion total than either June
1993 or August 1993.  The number of abortions declined between
June and July and increased between July and August.  The time
period with the highest number of abortions spanned six months,
from March to August -- straddling the enactment date -- and then
was followed by six months of low abortion totals after implementation
of the family cap.
<P>
While it is still premature to draw any decisive conclusions from
the welfare reform experiment in New Jersey, it is becoming increasingly
fantastic to claim that the state has experienced an upsurge in
abortions since the family cap took effect.  The reported &quot;increase&quot;
in abortions rests on a statistical illusion created by suppressing
data from the four-month period immediately preceding the policy
change -- which includes the highest abortion totals recorded
in the data under study.
<P>
Those who would hold welfare reform hostage in the name of saving
lives bear a significant burden of proof in maintaining that more
lives will be saved by preserving the current welfare system.
 The consistent, strong correlation between increased welfare
spending and increased abortions should be far more troublesome
data to pro-lifers than the most recent numbers from New Jersey.

<h2>RENEWING THE AMERICAN DREAM<br>
FOR EDUCATION</h2>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<i>Jennifer A. Marshall</i></center>
<p>
High-profile advocates of public education lack an inspiring vision
for the educational renewal of America.  President Bill Clinton,
Secretary of Education Richard Riley, Congress, teacher union
bosses -- all alternately cheerlead and criticize, but their discussions
usually degenerate into bickering over funding, equity, and the
competitiveness of the American economy.  Ultimately, they are
concerned about the educational <I>system</I> and its place in
the larger context of American society and the national economy.
Little of what they have to say deals with the real stuff of
education.
<p>
Dorothy Sayers, an author and a contemporary of C.S. Lewis, articulated
half a century ago the foolishness of focusing on the system and
thereby missing the whole aim of education:
<p><blockquote>
What use is it to pile task on task and prolong the days of labor,
if at the close the chief object is left unattained?  It is not
the fault of the teachers -- they work only too hard already.
 The combined folly of a civilization that has forgotten its own
roots is forcing them to shore up the tottering weight of an educational
structure that is built upon sand....  For the sole true end of
education is simply this:  to teach men how to learn for themselves;
and whatever instruction fails to do this is effort spent in vain.[1]
</blockquote><p>
Sayers clearly had a vision of what education ought to be.
<p>
Today, once again, those with the academic zeal that rallies others
to renew education have a vision that goes beyond the realities
of the public school system.  Their common sense, optimistic ideas
are not constrained by the inadequacies of a federally run education
bureaucracy.  As Frenchman Alexis de Tocqueville remarked in 1835,
such freedom from bureaucracy is -- or at least once was -- distinctively
American:  &quot;Uniformity or permanence of design, the minute
arrangement of details, and the perfection of administrative system
must not be sought for in the United States; what we find there
is the presence of a power which, if it is somewhat wild, is at
least robust....&quot;[2] Homeschooling and classical education
exemplify this genius and vibrancy of the American people.
<p>
<center><h3>SCHOOLING BY THE TRUE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION</h3></center>
<p>
We have long known that the &quot;true department of education,&quot;
as author Douglas Wilson refers to the family, is the institution
behind the success of the homeschool movement.[3] Recent scholarship,
however, shows the role of the family in the academic success
of children in all settings. Because parents are vested with the
authority and responsibility to oversee their children's upbringing,
especially their education, homeschooling ought not to be considered
the method of last resort, but a first option.  Recent scholarship
demonstrates that, no matter what the school setting, family is
the key factor in the academic success of children.[4]
<p>
Critics may view homeschoolers as somewhat reclusive, but the
flourishing movement contributes to society much more than they
recognize.  Increased interaction within the family counters the
individualism and the &quot;generation gaps&quot; created by the
secular culture.  With some 400,000 families currently homeschooling,
the movement has also become a gathering point for inter-family
relations.  Networks and support groups abound (see the addendum
for a sample listing).  Though the homeschooling movement takes
a back-to-basics approach to academics, it is thoroughly progressive
when it comes to using the latest technology.  CompuServe and
America Online forums provide helpful hints on raising kids, curriculum
tips, homework help, and an ongoing discussion of a new ideal
for education.
<p>
Homeschoolers are some of the most politically involved private
citizens in America.  Politicians have learned not to trifle with
the &quot;stay-at-home mom&quot; with a phone tree, a fax machine,
and a firm devotion to raising well-grounded children.  Initially
a measure for self-defense, homeschoolers' lobbying efforts have
strengthened the platform for all families in America.   Nationwide
homeschool networks have proven to be very effective avenues of
communication.  The Home School Legal Defense Association, located
outside of Washington, D.C., disseminates regular alerts calling
homeschoolers to action when threats to their -- and everyone's
-- freedom arise.
<p>
Bill and Mary Pride and their nine children are the epitome of
a fully engaged homeschooling family.  Ranging from toddlers to
teens, the kids are all taught at home and always have been. 
The Pride children's educational package takes advantage of everything
from traditional material to on-line computer classes.  To share
their good news in education, the Prides publish a quarterly magazine
called <i>Practical Homeschooling</i> with 96 pages of suggestions
for networking, critiques of curriculum and software, discussions
of educational theories and lighthearted openness about the joys
and trials of the homeschooling life.  Mary does much of the writing
herself and also gathers articles from some of the most staunchly
conservative education thinkers in the nation, including Samuel
Blumenfeld and Doug Wilson.  <I>Practical Homeschooling</I> now
has an on-line site of its own which includes forums for Q &amp;
A on homeschooling pragmatics and on-line chats with contributing
authors.
<p>
<center><h3>THE RETURN OF CLASSICAL EDUCATION</h3></center>
<p>
Truly a timeless educational philosophy, classical education has
now hit cyberspace and become the subject of much chatting in
homeschool online forums.  The resurgence of this medieval model
of education is due in large part to Douglas Wilson, author of
<I>Recovering the Lost Tools of Learning.</I>  His title refers
to the essay which inspired his efforts, entitled, &quot;The Lost
Tools of Learning,&quot; by Dorothy Sayers.  Miss Sayers' 1947
critique of education stall efforts in an apt commentary on America's
system of public education in the '90s:
<p><blockquote>
We dole out lip-service to the importance of education -- lip-service
and, just occasionally, a little grant of money; we postpone the
school-leaving age, and plan to build bigger and better schools;
the teachers slave conscientiously in and out of school hours;
and yet, as I believe, all this devoted effort is largely frustrated,
because we have lost the tools of learning, and in their absence
can only make a botched and piecemeal job of it.[5]
</blockquote><p>
What she goes on to describe as &quot;the lost tools of learning&quot;
are the disciplines of Grammar, Logic, and Rhetoric.  These are
the tools with which students must be equipped, she argues, in
order to tackle the content of any subject.  Sayers considers
Latin an important learning tool as well.  As the key to so many
languages, to the vocabulary of science, and to historical documents,
she estimates that in most subject areas, a knowledge of Latin
would cut learning time by half.  The study of Latin, and not
the &quot;dumbing down&quot; of the test, may prove to be the
surest way to recoup lost ground on the verbal section of the
SAT.
<p>
The contemporary relevance of Miss Sayers' insights is astonishing.
 While federal bureaucrats set a National Education Goal that
all our children will start school ready to learn, Sayers points
out that children are by nature sponges ready to absorb information.
 For those who disparage memorization and the accumulation of
factual knowledge, she points out that young children love litanies
of information.  She gives a whole new meaning to age appropriateness,
a topic of great discussion in the teaching colleges, by tying
Grammar, Logic, and Rhetoric to a child's stages of mental development.
 And how about Latin, as Sayers suggests, for early childhood
education?  &quot;The Lost Tools of Learning&quot; ought to be
required reading in every teacher education class; it cuts through
the confusion and inconsistencies of modern educational theory.
 Sayers' vision is idealistic yet practical; it has the power
to inspire and the wisdom to work.
<p>
Doug Wilson has demonstrated that effectiveness.  Fourteen years
ago he founded Logos School, a distinctively Christian school
based on the Sayers' model of classical education.  Today there
are some thirty member schools in his Association of Classical
and Christian Schools (ACCS).   &quot;These schools are engaged
in what might be one of the most important educational reforms
of our time,&quot; writes Dr. Gene Veith, Dean of Arts and Sciences
at Concordia University.[6] Dr. Veith is in the midst of a year-long
study of classical education.  While modern education disintegrates,
notes Dr. Veith, these classical schools are &quot;recovering
the very approach to education that gave birth to Western civilization
and has continually brought that civilization to renewal.&quot;
 The re-popularization of classical education is timely indeed.
<p>
<center><h3>THE GREAT BOOKS</h3></center>
<p>
While equipping students with grammar, logic, and rhetoric, classical
education focuses on the great literary works of Western civilization,
something modern schools do less and less as contemporary books
replace the old.  The neglect of great books in the schools is
a symptom of a wider cultural trend, as evidenced by the disappearance
of classics from many libraries across the nation.  The Family
Research Council study, &quot;Discarded Images:  Selected Classics
and American Libraries,&quot; by Charles Donovan and William Spont,
documents this phenomenon.
<p>
Large tomes of collected works with ancient bindings may intimidate
the modern reader, but C.S. Lewis argues that old books are not
merely for the expert, but especially for the ordinary reader:
<p><blockquote>
[I]f the average student wants to find out something about Platonism,
the very last thing he thinks of doing is to take a translation
of Plato off the library shelf and read the <I>Symposium</I>.
 He would rather read some dreary modern book ten times as long,
all about 'isms' and influences and only once in twelve pages
telling him what Plato actually said....  But if he only knew,
the great man, just because of his greatness, is much more intelligible
than this modern commentator....  It has always therefore been
one of my main endeavours as a teacher to persuade the young that
first-hand knowledge is not only more worth acquiring than second-hand
knowledge, but is usually much easier and more delightful to acquire.[7]
</blockquote><p>
In contrast, Lewis advises the ordinary reader to take up the
old books &quot;precisely because he is an amateur and therefore
much less protected than the expert against the dangers of an
exclusive contemporary diet.  A new book is still on its trial
and the amateur is not in a position to judge it.&quot;[8] Classical
education has taken the precaution of going back to the revered
classics.
<p>
<center><h3>NEW CONCLUSIONS FROM OLD PRINCIPLES</h3></center>
<p>
While homeschool and classical education may be perceived as eccentric,
esoteric, and even impractical because of their intense pursuit
of &quot;intellectualism,&quot; they are actually thoroughly pragmatic.
 Both models guide students through the learning process efficiently
and deliberately.  The educational sequence is logical and meaningful.
 Meanwhile, we continue to fund a modern public school system
that measures hours spent in school (&quot;seat time&quot;), where
the curriculum is so disjointed that classroom teachers are hard
pressed to answer students' question, &quot;Why do we have to
learn this?&quot;  Convoluted attempts to standardize and individualize
simultaneously have resulted in a dysfunctional system.
<p>
The traditional methods espoused by homeschooling and classical
education strike just the balance the public school system lacks.
 They hold a universally high standard of excellence, and an inherent
standardization which comes from keeping educationally on-task.
 Yet the homeschool and classical models are also much more individualized
than the public school classroom, not only on the basis of size,
but also in personal attention to the development of each child's
mind.  While in the modern system the outcome is paramount, in
classical education and homeschooling the process is just as important
as the end.
<p>
Classical education and homeschooling recognize that different
students have varying strengths, and that each student should
be strengthened in all domains.  Where public education has gradually
excluded certain subjects (art, music, logic, etc.) from the core
curriculum and advised teachers to cater to all learning styles
in the remaining subjects, homeschool and classical education
have embraced the classical liberal arts which train students
in the whole spectrum of knowledge.  A student may excel in one
area and struggle in another, but he will grow in all.
<p>
Leaders of public education would do well to take cues from their
competitors.  Commitment to the system, however, continues to
prevent many from recognizing potentials for renewal. Consequently,
significant overhaul of the public school system may be the only
remedy.  As Doug Wilson notes, this is exactly what William Bennett,
former Secretary of Education, suggested after the Governors'
education summit in 1989, which initiated the America 2000/Goals
2000 agenda:
<p><blockquote>
I'd give the education reform movement another five years.  If
we're not able to get our schools back to where they were in 1963,
after spending 40 percent more, then maybe we should just declare
bankruptcy, give the people back their money, and let them start
their own schools.  That would be a radical way to have accountability.[9]
</blockquote><p>
Time's up.   The people have started their own schools and they
have already outdone the public school system.   We want our money
back.

<title>MEDICAL SAVINGS ACCOUNTS</title>

<h2>MEDICAL SAVINGS ACCOUNTS:<br>
GOOD FOR HEALTH CARE REFORM,<br>
GOOD FOR FAMILIES</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%>
<p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Catherine A. Deeds</i></center>
<p>
<center><h3>CURRENT HEALTH CARE SITUATION</h3></center>
<p>
Last year's historic health care debate proved -- to the surprise
of no one but the Clinton Administration -- that American families
will not tolerate federal bureaucrats or &quot;gatekeepers&quot;
in Washington dictating their medical services and choice of doctors.
  A government-run, &quot;one size <I>must </I>fit all&quot; health
policy violates Americans' fundamental principles of freedom.
<p>
An overwhelming majority (roughly 85 percent) of small businesses
provide health insurance for their employees but they should not
be <I>forced</I> to pay for them through a federal mandate, as
Clinton's plan would have required.  A government mandate costs
wages and jobs in the long run and is not the way to reform health
care or help the uninsured population. 
<p>
While employer-provided health benefits may address the problem
of health care &quot;access,&quot;  they do not address the problem
of rising health care costs, which everyone agrees needs to be
addressed.  The national debate on health care reform debunked
the &quot;Washington knows best&quot; philosophy in favor of innovative
state and free-market health care initiatives.  At the forefront
of free-market reform is the concept of medical savings accounts
(also known as MSAs, Medisave accounts, or Medical IRAs).  They
are the centerpiece of the Republicans' health care plan and have
proved popular with the 2,000 private companies that now have
them.  The basic premise is that MSAs empower consumers to make
their own decisions about spending on routine health care, choose
their own doctors, and save unspent account funds from year to
year to pay for future health or retirement needs.  By contrast,
the present &quot;third-party payer&quot; system offers no incentive
to spend wisely because someone else -- the government or private
insurance --  is paying the bill. 
<p>
This year, a bipartisan Congressional proposal to make MSAs tax
free (like traditional health insurance) has 130 cosponsors and
prospects for passage are good.  Congressional Republicans have
advocated MSAs as a potential cost-saving measure for Medicare
recipients as well.
<p>
<I>This year $1 trillion was spent on health care, accounting
for one-seventh of the nation's entire economy</I>.  As costs
rise, consumers pay higher premiums for their health insurance.
 For the most part, consumers are spending the money of a third
party -- the insurance company or government.  When this is the
case, common sense shows that consumers will not spend frugally
or wisely.  Why should they?   Former Surgeon General C. Everett
Koop likened the present third-party payer system to this:  The
government invites people to pick out a new car, charge it to
a card they issue, and then pays the bill.  The problem with this
system is that no one buys a Hyundai.  They all buy Cadillacs
and BMWs.
<p>
Our present health care system discourages competition and cost-consciousness
because, unlike car insurance, the consumer does not see the bill
or, for the most part, use his own money to pay for services.
 Therefore, there is no incentive to shop for lower-cost medical
care.  The administrative costs of processing insurance claims
for the majority of employers account for up to 35 percent of
total premium costs, and average 25 percent of premium costs for
the majority of employers.
<p>
This is the case because traditional indemnity/health insurance
plans tend to stipulate a low-deductible (out-of-pocket) amount
of $100-$250.  In other words, once the consumer has paid the
first $250 out of pocket for his family's medical care, the insurance
begins to pay.  That seems like a good deal but it is very expensive
in the long run because of high administrative costs and the lack
of cost-consciousness that the third-party payment system instills.
<p>
It would make better economic sense for businesses or individuals
to purchase a &quot;high-deductible&quot; health insurance plan
(which costs less in monthly premiums), combined with an MSA for
health care expenses below the deductible level.  (This type of
arrangement, however, does not enjoy equitable tax treatment under
current law.)  The Business Coalition for Affordable Health Care
estimates that approximately 10 percent of Americans spend <I>more
than</I> $2,000 per year on medical expenses.  A March/April 1994
<I>Journal of American Health Policy</I> study (using 1994 dollars)
of one million Americans showed that one-third of the population
filed no claims in 1989; 73 percent filed $500 or less in claims;
82 percent filed  $1,000 or less; and 89 percent filed $2,000
or less.  &quot;In other words, if this group had a $2,000 deductible
MSA, only 11 percent would have reached the deductible,&quot;
the editors noted.  An MSA empowers consumers to pay for routine
medical expenses from their account and to keep the unspent funds
for future health care needs, thus creating incentives for shopping
around and wise spending.  Medical expenditures from the MSAs
are applied against the deductible until the deductible (out-of-pocket
expense) is met, at which point the insurance coverage begins.
<p>
<center><h3>PRIVATE COMPANIES UTILIZE MSAs</h3></center>
<p>
Because of these positive features, more than 2,000 large and
small companies have begun offering MSAs to their employees, with
great success, even though current federal law does not exempt
contributions to such accounts.   Interestingly, seven states
have achieved tax fairness in their state income tax codes by
exempting contributions to MSAs.
<p>
A March 1995 Cato Institute study analyzed several companies and
states that provide MSAs, noting dramatic cost-savings and improvement
in customer satisfaction.  Consider these two examples:
<p><blockquote>
Dramatic savings from using MSAs have also been achieved at Windham
Hospital in Willimantic, Conn., with 1,000 employees.  In 1993
the hospital switched from a pure first-dollar coverage plan with
no deductible or co-payments to a plan with a $500 deductible.
 It also contributes $10 per week, or $520 per year, to an MSA
for each worker.  In addition, the hospital negotiated discounts
for its employees when they pay for health services with MSA funds.
 The hospital itself offers discounts of 30 percent, area doctors
offer price reductions of 20 percent, and drugstores cut prices
by 10 percent.
<p>
Under the old plan, the hospital's employees used medical services
35 percent more than the community average.  After one year under
the new plan, however, the entire 35 percent excess was eliminated.
 Moreover, projected health costs for the hospital employees were
reduced by about 50 percent.
<p></blockquote>
The study even cites the case of The United Mine Workers Union
that successfully negotiated for MSAs in their contract. 
<p><blockquote>
Under an agreement with the Bituminous Coal Operators Association,
covering about 15,000 employees, coal mine operators now provide
workers insurance with a $1,000 deductible replacing a zero deductible
under the old health plan.  The employees are each provided a
$1,000 cash bonus at the beginning of the year that they can use
for health care expenses below the deductible.  At the end of
the year, workers can keep for any use whatsoever any portion
of the bonus they do not use for health care.
<p></blockquote>
<center><h3>HELP FOR LOWER-INCOME FAMILIES</h3></center>
<p>
Companies that have MSAs have found they are most popular among
lower-income employees.  Under conventional insurance plans, low-income
employees would have to meet their $250 or $500 deductible with
after-tax dollars before they could access their insurance.  A
single mother earning $14,000 or $15,000 a year may find it difficult
to meet the deductible when rent, transportation, taxes, grocery
bills and other needs for her children are pressing.  An MSA allows
these low-income earners first dollar coverage, permitting them
to get medical care when they or their children need it.  This
feature alone could significantly reduce the level of emergency
room utilization for non-emergency care.  Low-income wage earners
would have, in effect, first-dollar coverage for medical care
up to the amount in their MSA.
<p>
<center><h3>LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS IN CONGRESS</h3></center>
<p>
Congress has proposed several variations of MSA legislation, but
generally this legislation has been designed to end the current
tax discrimination against MSAs.  MSAs are flexible and would
operate as a <I>tax-free</I>, portable account which can be used
to pay medical bills (including those for eyeglasses and dental
care), in conjunction with a high-deductible (or &quot;catastrophic&quot;)
health insurance plan.  Contributions made by employers, the self-employed
or individuals would be tax-free.  If one needs to withdraw money
for non-medical expenses, the funds are taxed and a 10 percent
penalty applies.
<p>
MSA proposals have gained bipartisan support but have never passed
in Congress.  Now, the 104th Congress has the chance to pass an
MSA bill, such as the Family Medical Savings and Investment Act
of 1995, H.R. 1818, introduced by Reps. Bill Archer (R-Texas)
and Andrew Jacobs (D-Ind.).  This bill allows contributions made
to MSAs by employers, the self-employed, and individuals to be
tax-deductible.  Through tax fairness, the bill also helps the
uninsured, future senior citizens, and employed mothers, who will
no longer be forced to accept full-time employment to receive
tax-deductible health coverage.  The estimated cost of H.R. 1818
is $1.77 billion over seven years, according to the Joint Committee
on Taxation.  Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) recently introduced
a virtually  identical MSA proposal in the Senate, S. 1247. 
<p>
Under H.R. 1818 and S. 1247, there are annual limits on the amount
of money that can be placed in such accounts ($2,500 for an individual
or $5,000 for a family).  A 10 percent penalty is levied if the
money is withdrawn for non-medical expenses.  In addition, money
for non-medical expenses is also taxed as income, since the money
was deposited tax free.  As in the case of IRAs, a 10 percent
penalty would encourage savings and discourage frivolous non-medical
spending. 
<p>
The MSA is essentially a trust created exclusively for the purpose
of paying qualified medical expenses (QME) of the account holder
and his or her family.   Distributions for QMEs are excluded from
gross income.  QMEs are defined by section 213 (d) of the IRS
code, except that MSA expenses for insurance premiums other than
catastrophic plans or long-term care insurance premiums would
not be included.
<p>
H.R. 1818 has passed the House Ways and Means Committee and will
be included in the budget reconciliation package for consideration
under &quot;closed rules&quot; on the House floor.  That means
no amendments may be offered.  The reconciliation bill is an omnibus
&quot;must-pass&quot; budget package slated for a vote in October.
<p>

this policy.
</pre><p>
<ul>
<li>In  S. 1247, the amount of deposit is limited to the deductible
amount of the insurance policy or $2,500 for an individual or
$5,000 for a family.
<p>
<li>If this is used up in a year, the traditional or catastrophic
insurance plan kicks in. 
<p>
<li>If this is not used up in a year, the remainder can be retained
in the MSA to be used for next year's health expenses, or future
retirement (IRA) needs.
<p>
<li>Long-term care insurance policies can be purchased from the
MSA account.
<p>
<li>People laid-off or unemployed can use MSA funds to continue
to purchase high-deductible private health insurance.
</ul><p>
Let's say an employer, for example, will spend $4,000 per year
on health insurance for an individual.  The employer decides to
use that $4,000 for an MSA for his employee.  The employer purchases
a high-deductible insurance policy which costs $2,000 per year.
 The policy has a deductible of $2,500.  The employer then deposits
$2,000 into the MSA, from which the employee draws to meet routine
medical expenses.  Therefore, as an equation, the example above
would look like this: 
<p>
<center>
$4,000  =  $2,000 in premium costs for a health insurance policy<br>
with a $2,500 deductible  +  $2,000 deposited in the MSA
</center><p>
Next year, the employer deposits another $2,000 (usually in monthly
allotments) in the employee's MSA.  If the employee only spent
$1,000 the first year, then the employee would have $1,000 left
in the MSA at the beginning of the second year, when that year's
$2,000 would be deposited.  Therefore, the employee would have
$3,000 in the MSA at the beginning of the second year.  
<p>
Once initially set up, an MSA is useful in times of temporary
unemployment or in-between jobs.  The same <I>Journal of American
Health Policy</I> (cited above) reports that &quot;41 percent
of persons losing private health insurance have an uninsured spell
that ends within one to three months, and 71 percent have a dry
spell that ends within four months.&quot;   The &quot;portable&quot;
feature of  MSAs can prevent &quot;job lock&quot; - that is, a
situation in which someone feels &quot;forced&quot; to remain
in a job because of fear of losing good health benefits.   Those
unfortunate families who are chronically unemployed or earning
wages below the poverty level, will still be eligible for public
health programs, such as Medicaid and SSI, which will continue
to provide aid to the working poor.
<p>
<center><h3>TYPICAL FEATURES OF  H.R. 1818/S. 1247:</h3></center>
<p><ul>
<I>* tax free account, similar to IRA, for medical expenses</I><br>
<I>* employer or individual makes contribution (limit $)</I><br>
<I>* choose own doctor</I><br>
<I>* portable </I><br>
<I>* money in account rolls over year to year </I><br>
<I>* no claims, no new government bureaucracy or administrative
costs</I><br>
<I>* can withdraw savings for retirement at 59 1/2 years old</I><br>
<I>* 10 percent penalty for withdrawal for non-medical use</I><br>
<p></ul>
<center><h3>MEDICARE</h3></center>
<p>
As one possible alternative to Medicare, both House and Senate
committees have proposed  tax-free &quot;Medisave&quot; accounts,
similar to those proposed for working families, as a potential
option for seniors.  In the future, these Medisave accounts have
the potential to save seniors and the health care system money
by allowing personal account funds to be used to pay for expenses
not covered by the traditional health insurance plan, such as
prescription drugs or long-term care insurance premiums.   If
the money is spent wisely, there will be money left in the account
for next year's health expenses or for non-medical expenses (with
a small penalty).  This will help give the elderly and their families
an opportunity to best use the money.  It takes decisions away
from the Washington bureaucrats.  The House Ways and Means and
Senate Finance Committees have approved a medical savings account
option that combines a high-deductible insurance policy with a
Medicare MSA.   
<p>
<center><h3>SUMMARY</h3></center>
<p>
FRC believes Medical Savings Accounts are family-friendly health
care reform.  Ultimately, all health care reform legislation should
be judged within the following family-based guidelines:  
<p><ul>
<li>Fosters Genuine Compassion
<li>Makes Prudence Pay
<li>Promotes Family Autonomy
<li>Recognizes the Family's Contribution to Good Health
<li>Empowers Families to Act

<h2>YOUTH GANGS: OUT OF<br>
CONTROL AND GETTING<br>
WORSE</h2>

<p>
A recent decline in violent crime appears to be more a result
of fewer teenagers than better law enforcement.  When the current
bumper crop of elementary-age children become adolescents, the
violent crime rate is likely to explode.
<p>
A growing chorus of experts warn of the impending youth crime
crisis.  Reggie Walton, a Washington, D.C. Superior Court judge
who handles juvenile cases, blames it on the disappearance of
fathers.  Walton says fathers leave children to be raised by young
mothers who themselves are often struggling with mental or emotional
problems, limited education, poverty and addiction.  Walton labels
these children &quot;walking time bombs.&quot;[1]
<p>
This time bomb has been in the making for some time.  Youth violent
crime has been rising dramatically for more than a decade.  Today,
and historically, young males commit far more crimes than other
age groups.
<p>
The volatile mix of more chronic juvenile delinquents and an upward
surge in youthful perpetrators of violence is complemented by
an unprecedented growth in youth living with little or no adult
supervision.  Consider some recent examples.
<p><ul>
<li>A Los Angeles family takes a wrong turn into gang territory
and is fired upon.  A 3-year-old is killed and her 2-year-old
brother wounded.
<p><li>A Chinese immigrant in Brooklyn is kidnapped by a Chinatown
gang which demands ransom payments from her family.  She is murdered
when the family fails to pay.
<p><li>Two FBI agents and a police sergeant are murdered inside the
Washington, D.C. police headquarters by a gang member.
<p><li>A Pittsburgh police sergeant walking home with his daughter
is killed with his own gun after he stops and confronts a gang
spraying graffiti on a street.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>WALKING TIME BOMBS</h3></center>
<p>
Vice President Albert Gore recently told the White House press
corps, &quot;Gangs have been a major cause of the growth in violent
crime in the past decade.&quot;[2] He cited a Treasury Department
report that found the presence of rival gangs, the Bloods and
the Crips, in 35 states and 58 cities across the country.
<p>
At the same press conference, Attorney General Janet Reno cited
the impact of disabling one gang in New Haven, Connecticut.  Eighteen
members of the &quot;Jungleboy&quot; street gang were put in jail,
and, according to Reno, New Haven's murder rate fell by one-third
in 1993.[3]
<p>
Given that youth gangs account for a disproportionate share of
youth violence, their potential for contributing to a future crime
wave is enormous.
<p>
At the current growth rate, there will be nearly half-a-million
more adolescent boys in the year 2010 than today.  That means
if current trends continue, we will have perhaps 30,000 more chronic
juvenile delinquents by the year 2010 than today.  Chronic youth
offenders comprise 7 percent of all male teenagers and they commit
70 percent of all serious crime for their age group.[4]
<p>
If history is any predictor, these adolescents will be more violent
than the current delinquents.  According to the Department of
Justice, today's youth are extremely violent.  Firearms are now
used by three-fourths of all juvenile homicide offenders and 
one-third of all reported violent crime offenders are less than
21 years old.  Juvenile arrests for all violent crime have increased
from 1983 to 1992 in spite of the decline in the overall number
of teenagers in the U.S. population.  The government estimates
that the juvenile arrest rate for major violent crime will more
than double by the year 2010.[5]
<p>
This ticking youth time bomb is evident everywhere.  California
authorities report that incarcerations of violent youth increased
from 44 percent of the prison population in 1987 to 61 percent
in 1992[6]. There is no sign of a turnaround.  Officials in the
upscale Washington, D.C. suburb of Fairfax, Virginia, report that
the number of juveniles arrested for violent crimes has climbed
61 percent since 1991.  The number of youth arrested with weapons
has risen 118 percent since 1989.[7]
<p>
A 1993 report by the Washington State Department of Community
Development states, &quot;Our state and nation are awash in a
tidal wave of violence, violence that has reached epidemic proportions
especially among our youngest generation.&quot;[8]
<p>
Professor Dean Rojek, a sociologist at the University of Georgia,
says, &quot;For decades violent crime was driven mostly by adults,
with kids involved mostly in property crime....What's been changing is 
that you have juveniles becoming much more involved in violent offenses, 
with the use of weapons. If we add to this more babies, you could have a 
multiplier effect...a mini explosion [in violent crime by youth].&quot;[9]
<p>
Attorney General Janet Reno agrees.  &quot;Unless we act now,&quot;
says Reno, &quot;to stop young people from choosing a life of
violence and crime, the beginning of the 21st century could bring
levels of violent crime to our community that far exceed what
we have experienced.&quot;[10]
<p>
<center><h3>GANGS EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM</h3></center>
<p>
The bomb's fuse is shortened by the youth gang phenomenon.  California
authorities describe the youth gang as a &quot;violent and insidious
new form of organized crime.  Heavily armed with sophisticated
weapons, (gangs) are involved in drug trafficking, witness intimidation,
extortion, and bloody territorial wars.  In some cases they are
traveling out of state to spread their violence and crime.&quot;[11]
<p>
According to the FBI,  &quot;The fastest growing murder circumstance
is juvenile gang killings.&quot;[12] Almost one-third of Los Angeles'
homicides are gang related.[13] Nationwide, the rate of violent offenses
by gang members is three times as high as for non-gang delinquents.[14]
<p>
There's something about young males belonging to a gang that makes
them more violent.
<p><ul>
<li>Orange County, California probation statistics indicate that
gang-related youth had significantly higher law-violation rates (55.1 percent) 
than non-gang affiliated youth (26.4 percent).[15] A study of 20 years of 
data collected by Philadelphia's police gang unit shows that &quot;gangs
engage in more violent behavior than do delinquent non-gang groups.&quot;[16]
<p>
<li>Metropolitan Life surveyed schools about gang violence.  It
found that more than half (59 percent) of law enforcement and one-third (34 
percent) of students and teachers say gang or group membership is a major
cause of violence in schools.[17]
<p>
<li>A study in Wisconsin found that most violent crimes by youths
were committed by groups of three or more.  This &quot;pack&quot; behavior, 
not surprisingly, seems to be at the core of much of the rise in youth
crime.[18]
<p>
<li>A study of New York City teenage gunshot victims found that
40 percent were shot during school hours.  Another study found that of 
children and teenagers wounded in drive-by shootings in Los Angeles, 71 
percent were &quot;documented members of street gangs.&quot;[19]
<p></ul>
Not only do gang members tend to be more violent than non-gang
members, but gang membership appears to prolong one's criminal
career.  One study found that a &quot;large portion of persistent
and dangerous juvenile gang offenders become even more serious
adult offenders.&quot;[20] Another study in California found that
previously-incarcerated gang members continued their lives of
crime after being released.[21]
<p>
<center><h3>GANGS - AN AMERICAN PHENOMENON?</h3></center>
<p>
As early as the 1600s, London was &quot;terrorized by a series
of organized gangs...[who] fought pitched battles among themselves
dressed with colored ribbons to distinguish the different factions.&quot;[22]
 Gang problems have been reported in most of Europe, the former
Soviet Union, Africa, South America, Mexico, New Zealand and Japan.
<p>
One of the first reports of youth gangs in America comes from
Philadelphia.  In 1791, that city's leaders convened a conference
to decide how to deal with bands of disruptive youth.[23]
<p>
New York City had a similar problem in the 19th century.  New
York's gangs tended to be political agents for the Know Nothing
or Native American Party.  During the early Civil War years there
were draft riots which may have been started by Irish street gangs.[24]
<p>
The classic movie, <I>West Side Story</I>, is stereotypical of
20th century gang life.  The Sharks and the Jets are territorial
gangs protecting their neighborhoods.  Until recently, however,
gangs like these were not considered a threat to the general population.
<p>
Neither a 1967 presidential commission on law enforcement nor
the 1976 National Advisory Committee on Criminal Standards and
Goals foresaw today's gang problem. They concluded, &quot;Youth
gangs are not now or [sic] should not become a major object of
concern....Youth gang violence is not a major problem in the United
States....What gang violence does exist can fairly readily be
diverted into 'constructive' channels, especially through the
provision of services by community agencies.&quot;[25]
<p>
<center><h3>WHY ARE GANGS SPREADING?</h3></center>
<p>
Gangs are spreading across the country and are not just limited
to major cities.  Bernard Friedlander, a University of Hartford psychology 
professor and a violence expert, says, &quot;This is an American problem, 
not an inner-city problem....It's spreading slowly....On one level it's 
simple fad imitation...but on another level the
isolation of youth is just as profound in some of the more stable
areas as in the inner city.&quot;[26]
<p>
Ed Edelman, a Los Angeles supervisor, said, &quot;Gangs are very
mobile today.  They don't just stay in one area.  They are not just limited 
to poor areas of the country.  They are all over the place.&quot;[27]
<p>
The spread of gangs can be attributed to at least three factors.
 First, parents, desiring to protect their gang-culture-saturated
children from the hometown gang's influence, send them to relatives
across the country.  Sometimes this strategy works.  But many
times it merely helps transplant the gang culture into a new community.
<p>
The drug trade has created entrepreneurial gangs which fan out
across the country to ply their trade and expand their markets.
 Franchises of the Bloods and the Crips are now in most metropolitan
centers.  With their expansion, they have introduced collateral,
gang-like violence.
<p>
Finally, the entertainment industry contributes to the spread
of gangs.  The gang culture, value system and mentality are sprinkled
across the country through movies, &quot;gangsta&quot; rap music
and now comic books.  These cultural amplifiers educate young
audiences to gang values and attitudes.  They denigrate women,
promote exaggerated manhood or  &quot;machismo,&quot; and glorify
violence.  They also pass on gang language, symbols, activities,
and traditions.[28]
<p>
<center><h3>GANG NUMBERS, LOCATION AND TYPES</h3></center>
<p>
According to Justice Department estimates, the United States has
some 1,436 gangs and 120,636 gang members.  They exist in large,
mid-sized and small communities and in suburban areas.[29]
<p>
The Justice Department figures are disputed by the National School
Safety Center, which in 1993 estimated that the Los Angeles area
alone has at least 959 gangs with approximately 125,000 gang members.[30]
 Another report states that more than 350,000 gang members reside
along the West Coast.[31] To further confuse the issue, a 1975 study
found a total of 760 to 2,700 gangs in the nation's eight largest
cities.[32]
<p>
There are many types of gangs.  Some are black, white, Asian,
Hispanic or other ethnic-centered gangs.  Others are structured
around territory, commercial activities, corporate businesses,
political agendas, religion, music and special types of crime.
<p><ul>
<li><B>Race/ethnic-based gangs</B>:  Larry Rawles, deputy director
of Philadelphia's Crisis Intervention Network, says, &quot;When any ethnic 
group was at the bottom, they formed gangs -- the Jews, the Irish, the 
Italians.&quot;[33] Gangs offered status, a sense of self-worth, 
and protection.  Today, most gangs are racially segregated (54.6
percent are African American and 32.6 percent are Hispanic).  Blacks and 
Hispanics constitute the largest numbers of youths arrested for gang 
offenses today.[34]
<p>
The all-black rival gangs, the Crips and the Bloods, have an estimated
70,000 members in Los Angeles County alone.[35] They have franchises
in most states and metropolitan communities where they tend to
dominate the crack cocaine trade.
<p>
Darlyne Pettinicchio, a probation officer in Orange County, California,
says, &quot;(White gangs are) punk rockers and heavy metalers
(who) come from all socio-economic classes.  They're of average
intelligence and they're capable youngsters.  They have very little
parental authority.  They're usually angry.  Their dance is violent.
 Their music is violent.  Their behavior is violent.  They're
into anarchy.&quot;[36]
<p>
There are numerous Hispanic, Satanic cult, Asian, and Stoner (punk
rock and heavy metal) gangs.  Each has a subculture and each tends
to be very violent and involved in the use and or distribution
of illicit drugs.
<p>
<li><B>Economic-based gangs</B>:  Some gangs are organized around
a commercial activity. Members may be all from a single race or the same 
neighborhood or they may be very diverse.  The glue that holds them together
is making money.
<p>
They often see themselves as Robin Hoods or Bonnie-and-Clyde types
who practice their own version of free enterprise.  A close cousin
is the corporate gang, which selects a type of industry or business
and dominates the field through intimidation and violence.   For
example, there was a Miami-based gang called the &quot;Mazda boys&quot;
who specialized in stealing Mazda cars.
<p>
<li><B>Territorial gangs</B>:  Territorial gangs can be from any
race or ethnic background. They lay claim to a particular territory. They 
typically &quot;tag&quot; their territory with gang graffiti and are 
willing to defend their turf to the death. When their territory is invaded 
the gang provides &quot;warriors.&quot;
<p></ul>
<center><h3>WHO JOINS A GANG?</h3></center>
<p>
No matter the type of gang, most gang members are male.  A Chicago
study of four police districts found that only 2 to 5 percent
of gang arrestees were female.[37] These females are typically auxiliary
gang members.
<p>
Gang members range in age from 8 to 22 years old, but there are
exceptions where tenure is often well beyond 22 to perhaps more
than 40 years old.[38] A counselor in a juvenile detention facility
in California said: &quot;(If) you find a gang member who comes
from a complete nuclear family, a kid who has never been exposed
to any kind of abuse, I'd like to meet him....a real 'gangbanger'
who comes from a happy, balanced home, who's got a good opinion
of himself.  I don't think that kid exists.&quot;[39]
<p>
Sydney Harris, a nationally syndicated columnist, said, &quot;Gang
members tend to be chronic losers, who can accomplish nothing
individually, or who live in so depressed an environment that
only by banding together can they exercise any influence over
their lives.  In both cases, they are as much to be pitied as
condemned.&quot;[40]
<p>
Allen Frazier, superintendent of schools for Plymouth, Connecticut,
blames economic problems.  &quot;As people have more economic
problems in the adult world,&quot; says Frazier, &quot;it transfers
to the young people as well....[The children] don't seem to have
a place where they are comfortable.  In order to seek that, sometimes
they end up with the security of a gang....It becomes an extended
family which they may not have.&quot;[41]
<p>
A gang researcher says, &quot;These gang kids have nothing to
do that they perceive as useful.  They are the disconnected, alienated
ones.  They identify with whatever is trendy in terms of music,
clothes, and in terms of behavior.  They are living entirely on
the surface of life.&quot;[42]
<p>
Prisons are often referred to as gang training schools.  Often
gangs are formed in prison and then emigrate to the streets. 
The cohesion associated with jail time amplifies gang loyalty.
<p>
Fred Williams, the executive director for Common Ground Foundation,
a Watts [Los Angeles, California] nonprofit organization that
works with gang youth, says, &quot;Prison doesn't scare them.
 It's a home away from home.&quot;[43]
<p>
<center><h3>GANG CULTURE</h3></center>
<p>
Professor Cornel West, a Princeton University social scholar,
says in his book <I>Race Matters</I> that the nihilistic thinking
of the inner city black community sets the stage for gang formation.
 West says, &quot;The frightening result is a numbing detachment
from others and a self-destructive disposition toward the world.
 Life without meaning, hope, and love breeds a cold-hearted, mean-spirited
outlook that destroys both the individual and others.&quot;[44]
<p>
The youth gang satisfies a void.  It provides the child a sense
of identity, belonging, power, and protection.  The gang satisfies
the child's desire to feel secure.  Living in a high-risk environment
without paternal protection, the young gangster satisfies his
insecurities by aligning himself with a gang, his surrogate family.
 The gang provides a protective barrier against the outside forces.
<p>
One gang member says, &quot;Being in a gang means if I didn't
have no family, I think that's where I'll be.  If I didn't have
no job that's where I'd be.  To me it's community help without
all the community.  They'll understand better than my mother and
father.&quot;[45]
<p>
His new &quot;family&quot; has a distinct set of values that affect
every aspect of his life.  According to the Los Angeles District
Attorney, the gang culture is radically different from the mainline
culture.  &quot;It confronts and confounds adult authority on
every level -- sex, work, power, love, education, language, dress,
music, drugs, alcohol, violence.  As icons of popular culture,
gangs not only represent a powerful group identity utterly inaccessible
to adults, they are surrounded with an appealing aura of outlaw
danger.&quot;[46]
<p>
Visible manifestations of the gang culture include colors, signs,
symbols, graffiti, and tattoos.  Gang colors, different types
of clothing and head covering help distinguish one gang from another.
 Even some National Football League players who are connected
to gangs wear gang-colored bandanas.
<p>
Gangs often have their peculiar vocabulary.  Many black street
gangs address each other as &quot;cuz&quot; for cousin.  They
often have code words and many speak like &quot;rappers.&quot;
<p>
&quot;Tagging&quot; their territory with gang graffiti is common.
 It proclaims the presence of the gang and offers a challenge
to rivals.  It may claim credit for a crime.  The denser the graffiti,
the closer one is to the gang's core territory.  The Crips often
mark &quot;B/K&quot; for &quot;Bloods killers.&quot;
<p>
Gang behavior is characterized by extreme loyalty.  Members never
inform on &quot;homeboys,&quot; even if faced with death.  Once
in a gang, the member faces long odds of ever leaving alive.
<p>
Captain Russell Holyfield of the Hartford Police Department describes
gang protocol.  &quot;You give someone a dirty look,&quot; says
Holyfield, &quot;or say something about their girlfriend and later
on that day, you're a target.&quot;[47]
<p>
A Los Angeles District Attorney gang study describes the macho-psychology
of the gang culture.  &quot;The gang's ideal man is virtually
identical to the romantic myth of the gunfighter of the Old West
-- a two-fisted, hard-drinking, dangerous man who is quick to
avenge any insult; he lives and dies by violence, with his exploits
rousing fear and respect in the hearts of men, and in the hearts
of women, fear and desire.&quot;[48]
<p>
&quot;Gangsta&quot; rap is filled with messages that glorify violence,
extreme abuse of women and disrespect for authority.  The rapper's
lyrics paint a realistic picture of daily gangster activity.
<p>
Despite this, some gangs have an odd sense of civility.  A Los
Angeles Hispanic gang member says, &quot;When I'm out on the streets,
I know I'm safe if I'm with my mom.  You don't disrespect anybody
if they are with their mom.&quot;[49]
<p>
Partying and fighting, the core activities of a gang, are what
draw many young males.  According to the Los Angeles District
Attorney's report, &quot;These are the things that build and define
group loyalties.  Even criminality, which is probably the public's
main perception of what gangs are about, is less a core value
of the gang than a byproduct of the emphasis on partying and fighting.&quot;[50]
<p>
Sergeant Joe Guzman with the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department
explains prison's influence on the gang culture:  &quot;One prison
gang member might see that another gang member had something he
wanted.  If he was larger, more powerful or had more back-up from
his 'homeboys' than the other inmate, he literally just took the
item he wanted.  If he was angered in one fashion or another he
retaliated with deadly vengeance and commanded the presence of
his entire gang to back him up.&quot;[51]
<p>
<center><h3>GANG ORGANIZATION</h3></center>
<p>
Gangs are loosely organized.  Some are part of larger structures
known as &quot;nations,&quot; which are networked nationwide.
 But most are loosely knit groups with several leaders.
<p>
The 1960 New York City Youth Board proposed a theory of gang structure,
stating gangs are structured both vertically and horizontally.
 The vertical gang is structured along age lines and draws members
from local neighborhoods.  The horizontal gang has older members
who are drawn from a larger area.[52] This type of gang tends to
evolve into coalitions, supergangs and nations.  The term &quot;supergang&quot;
was coined in Chicago in the late 1960s to describe a gang with
thousands of members.[53]
<p>
Virtually every gang is built from groups called &quot;cliques.&quot;
 One gang researcher called the clique a &quot;spontaneous interest
group usually of the conflict type which forms itself within some
larger social structure such as a gang.&quot;[54] Members of cliques
tend to be similar in age.
<p>
Gang leaders are chosen by natural selection based on the person's
age, physical stature, arrest record and behavior.  Like any organization,
according to one researcher, the &quot;ability to get along with
people is one of the basic skills associated with gang leadership.&quot;[55]
<p>
Some gangs have formal leaders known as king, prince, prime minister,
general, don, or chief .  Others are informal, known as &quot;shot
callers&quot; or &quot;shooters.&quot;   Leadership responsibilities
may be shared and based upon a &quot;collection of functions that
may be undertaken at various times by a number of members.&quot;[56]
<p>
<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>
<p>
&quot;We've got so many kids out there who've lost hope, who believe
in only living for today,&quot; says John Turner, chief of police
for the city of Mountlake Terrace, Washington. &quot;They join
a gang and get involved in criminal activity because there aren't
any people taking them by the hand in simple terms and pointing
them in the right direction, giving them self-esteem and positive
feedback.&quot;[57]
<p>
Perhaps gangs exist because modern society has failed to harness
the male hunter/predator instinct and converted those energies
to familial provider/protector efforts.  Delinquent young people
lacking values, conscience or a sense of remorse can easily find
themselves drawn to the gang lifestyle.
<p>
Noted author James Q. Wilson writes in <I>The Moral Sense</I>
that modern society with its &quot;rapid technological change,
intense division of labor, and ambiguous allocation of social
roles, frequently leaves some men out, with their aggressive predispositions
either uncontrolled or undirected.  Gangs are one result.&quot;[58]
<p>
Wilson says the profits from illegal drug sales provide gang members
economic opportunities which combine with their uncontrolled aggression
to develop a &quot;warrior culture that underinvests in family
life.&quot;
<p>
Converting male energy to familial provider/protector efforts
has always been the task of the intact family.  But the nuclear
family is declining, especially in predominantly black inner cities
where gangs dominate life and rain violent crime.  Many of these
children join gangs to find purpose, security, and self-esteem.
 The gang culture gives them a sense of belonging and remakes
their value system.  Partying, fighting, and vicious gang loyalty
become their primary values, thus pushing aside virtues that favor
family life.  This is a vicious cycle and it must be broken.
<p>
Defusing the youth crime bomb must include a strategy to dismantle
the growing youth gang movement.  Gangs are the powder magazine
-- they must be dealt with before the bomb goes off.

<title>CONGRESS MAY FORM A COMMISSION TO STUDY LEGALIZED GAMBLING</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/insight/insight.gif">
<p>
<h2>CONGRESS MAY FORM A<br>
COMMISSION TO STUDY<br>
LEGALIZED GAMBLING</h2>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>
<p>
America is experiencing a wave of legalized gambling. Some consider
government-sponsored betting a financial godsend, but for others
it is a social and economic disaster that will stop only when
the public says enough is enough.
<p>
Gambling has grown in an ad hoc manner with states and cities
emulating others that appear to be successful. Officials look
with envy as citizens go to other states and cities to wager.
But as one politician who led the battle to legalize gambling
in Atlantic City warned, &quot;Casino gambling is not a 'try it
and see' experiment. Once the casino opens and the dice begin
to roll, gambling creates an instant constituency. People depend
on it for jobs. Governments depend on it for revenues.&quot;[1]
<p>
Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.) has introduced legislation intended to
discover the true nature of gambling. Wolf's bill, the National
Gambling Impact and Policy Commission Act, calls for the creation
of a two-year commission to study gambling. The Act was approved
by voice vote November 8, 1995, by the House Judiciary Committee
and is expected to see House floor debate in 1996.[2]
<p>
A similar bill has been introduced in the Senate by Paul Simon
(D-Ill.) and Richard Lugar (R-Ind.).[3] The proposed commission will
examine policies and practices with respect to legalization or
prohibition of gambling and make recommendations for legislation
and administrative action.
<p>
This legislation is considered necessary because of the gradual
creation of 37 state lotteries and the expansion of casino gambling
to 23 states (prompted in part by the Indian Gaming Regulatory
Act of 1988) as well as an avalanche of gaming promoters selling
government officials on the economic benefits of legalization.
These sponsors sell legalization as an economic boon and a harmless
recreational pastime, but there is considerable evidence that
this rush to easy money actually costs the taxpayer more than
it harvests.
<p>
Columnist William Safire speaks for many when he labels gambling
&quot;a $40-billion-a-year industry that is inherently immoral,
corrupting public officials, enriching criminals, addicting and
impoverishing the young and the vulnerable.&quot;[4] He supports
the legislation now pending in the 104th Congress.
<p>
According to Congressman Wolf's bill, the proposed federal commission
would consider 11 broad areas. The following summarizes what is
already known about some of these areas.
<p>
<center><h3>ECONOMIC IMPACT</h3></center>
<p>
Tunica County, Mississippi was known as the poorest county in
the country. In January 1992, it had an unemployment rate of 26.2
percent and a per capita income of $11,865. More than half of
its citizens were on food stamps.[5]
<p>
Since legalized gambling came to Tunica County, land values have
skyrocketed from $250 to $25,000 per acre. Over a billion dollars
in building permits have been granted. The nine area casinos each
average 1,000 employees, bringing unemployment down to 4.9 percent.
Child support collections have doubled, welfare benefits have
been nearly halved, food stamp recipients have decreased and property
taxes have been cut one-third.[6]
<p>
Webster Franklin, executive director of the Tunica County chamber
of commerce, is a gambling fan. He told a House committee in September
1995 that gambling is the best thing to happen to his county.
<p>
Such reports cause officials of money-strapped government agencies
to salivate. Detroit, for example, equates casinos with economic
salvation. For years, gambling citizens have crossed the Detroit
River to make wagers in Canada.
<p>
John Kelly, a lawyer and former Michigan state senator who opposed
gambling when he was in the legislature, now works for a local
investment group. He said the presence of Canadian casinos across
the river has been persuasive to him. He wants Detroit to reap
some of the profit from gambling rather than watch locals cross
the border to wager. Michigan Governor John Engler has appointed
an 11-member commission to study whether an Indian-run casino
would benefit the city.[7]
<p>
The story in Mobile, Alabama, is quite different. Mayor Mike Dow
believed that $63 million was spent by Alabama residents at nearby
Gulfport, Mississippi gambling casinos. When Mayor Dow investigated
bringing casinos to his city, he found the price was too high.
<p>
Forty-one of Mobile's social service agency CEO's were tasked
to determine the probable effects of introducing casinos. The
five-month study found that introducing casinos would cost the
city $15 million more each year in increased social service costs.
<p>
Charles White, CEO, Franklin Memorial Health Care Center of Mobile,
said, &quot;Our social service staff is already seeing an impact
from casinos in Mississippi....We see families selling their food
stamps and WIC vouchers for gambling money, and we are aware of
one family who lost its home.&quot;[8]
<p>
Joyce Collier, executive director of Mobile's Family Counseling
Center, states: &quot;[in the Biloxi/Gulfport area] families have
lost everything that they have worked for in terms of physical
holdings....Some clients have pawned car titles and lost transportation....Our
family counselors report increased alcohol and drug abuse and
spouse abuse.&quot;[9]
<p>
In 1994, Florida governor Lawton Chiles sponsored an economic
impact study of gambling. He found that Florida could anticipate
gambling revenues ranging from $324 to $469 million each year,
but that collateral costs outstripped the gain. Sales tax revenues
would drop $84.7 million, and crime and social costs attributable
to casinos were estimated to reach between $2.16 and $3.8 billion
annually.[10]
<p>
University of Nevada professor of public administration William
Thompson explained Florida's dilemma. Casinos generate significant
new tax revenues &quot;only if they can export their product.
The local economy doesn't benefit if only local people are gambling.&quot;[11]
Florida's geography is unlike Atlantic City and Las Vegas, which
draw gamblers from other states and send them packing with the
residue of gambling pathologies. That tab is absorbed by the gamblers'
home states. But Florida believes most of its potential gamblers
would be residents and not out-of-state tourists.
<p>
National gambling expert Robert Goodman studied the industry's
claims of economic benefits for the Ford Foundation and the Aspen
Institute. He says there is a critical lack of objective knowledge
and research about the real economic and social costs and benefits
of legalizing gambling. He warns that the research often used
by public officials tends to be unbalanced because it has been
provided by the gambling industry.[12]
<p>
Goodman's 1994 study analyzed 14 gambling industry studies concluding
that &quot;hiding the costs&quot; of gambling was widespread and
gambling acted as &quot;economic cannibalism&quot; on pre-existing
economies and other businesses.[13]
<p>
John Kindt, a professor of commerce at the University of Illinois,
has estimated that for every dollar that states take in from gambling
they pay three dollars to social agencies and crime fighting.
A problem gambler costs the state an average of $13,000 a year
in social impact.[14]
<p>
<center><h3>IMPACT ON BUSINESS</h3></center>
<p>
Louisiana gambled and is now paying the price. That state legalized
riverboat gambling and a few land-based casinos several years
ago. Recent events show the error of that decision.
<p>
Mike Foster, a Republican who ran on an anti-gambling platform,
was recently elected governor. He promises a state referendum
on gambling's future within a year.[15]
<p>
Additionally, on November 22, 1995 Harrah's Jazz Company, a consortium
that was building a 200,000-square-foot casino on New Orleans's
Canal Street, filed for protection under chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy law. This action caused the layoff of 3,500 workers
and a net loss of $23.6 million each year for the city. Why? Because
the temporary casino was doing poorly. Gambling investors miscalculated
the appeal of gambling.[16]
<p>
Gambling is leading many communities into economic distress. Atlantic
City has created 43,000 jobs over 10 years, but now the city has
only one business -- gambling. When casinos first came to Atlantic
City, there were 2,100 thriving small businesses. Today the number
is near 1,100 and falling. According to a New Jersey commission
report, &quot;It is clear that retail business and retail employment
in Atlantic City have continued to decline despite the presence
of gambling, and that rampant speculation has rendered the development
of vast parts of Atlantic City difficult if not impossible.&quot;[17]
<p>
In Illinois it was hoped that an economic facelift would result
when riverboats were introduced. But Earl L. Grinols, a University
of Illinois economist, examined the economic data in April 1994.
He found that &quot;riverboat gambling did not create the jobs
that were promised and had very little effect on reducing unemployment.&quot;[18]
He concluded, &quot;Economically speaking, it appears that riverboat
casinos shift jobs as opposed to creating jobs. For example, the
number of independent restaurants drops when a casino opens up.
Car sales have been known to go down with the onset of gambling.&quot;[19]
<p>
A survey by Chicago's Better Government Association (BGA) of 324
business owners in Illinois' riverboat towns found that a majority
said the floating casinos had no effect or a negative effect on
their businesses. BGA director J. Terrence Brunner said, &quot;Clearly,
riverboat gambling has not met the criteria set forth by Illinois
legislators when they sold this to the citizens of Illinois. The
economic development we found was marginal at best. It has not
spurred economic development. It has not created jobs. It has
not boosted tourism, and it certainly has not brought new life
to Illinois rivers or beautified their banks.&quot;[20]
<p>
Jeffrey Bloomberg, state's attorney, Lawrence County, South Dakota,
told the House Committee on Small Business on September 21, 1995,
that since 1988 when casino gambling was legalized for Deadwood,
South Dakota, life has been a nightmare. Real estate values have
skyrocketed, taxes have risen and gaming revenues have been eaten
up by increased administrative, law enforcement and infrastructure
costs.[21]
<p>
When casino gambling swept into three Colorado towns, it radically
changed life for the worse. According to a 1992 <I>Wall Street
Journal</I> article, &quot;[I]nstead of a few slot machines, full-blown
casinos owned by Las Vegas veterans and real-estate developers
have swept in, swallowing many mom-and-pop businesses along the
way. Water, sewer and traffic systems have been overwhelmed, crime
has increased, non-casino businesses face huge tax increases and
the relative calm of local politics has been shattered.&quot;[22]
<p>
Many communities with gambling experience are discovering the
hollow promises of the sponsors of this get-rich-quick industry.
Gambling creates many low paying jobs, diverts consumer dollars
into gambling, cannibalizes small businesses, and saddles those
that remain with burdensome tax liabilities. Gambling has a cumulative
negative economic impact.[23]
<p>
<center><h3>POLITICS AND PUBLIC POLICY IMPACT</h3></center>
<p>
The gambling industry is sophisticated when it comes to getting
what it wants. Consider the Mashantucket Pequot Indians' gambling
operations in Connecticut.
<p>
Today, the 370-member Pequot tribe operates a 17-story, 1,229-room
hotel and casino facility that draws 50,000 visitors a day. The
facility is managed by Gerald Michael Brown, a former New Jersey
deputy attorney general. Brown recently failed to win state support
to expand Pequot gambling to Bridgeport, a New York City suburb,
but it wasn't for lack of trying.[24]
<p>
Brown hired a law firm for $100,000 a month to prowl the halls
of Connecticut's capitol to sway lawmakers. The Pequot tribe ran
television commercials and sent out direct mail appeals touting
the financial benefits for the taxpayer. The cumulative effort
cost the tribe $13 million over four years. The fact is that the
Pequots contribute more to the state coffers than any single organization.[25]
But in November 1995, the state senate, by a majority of 24-10,
shot down the proposal. Count on a comeback.
<p>
The Pequots are generous on the national scene as well. In 1994,
the tribe contributed $215,000 in soft money to the Democratic
party and $465,000 to the Republicans. The industry's total public
contributions for 1993-1994 were $1,642,229.[26] But that doesn't
account for all contributions.
<p>
In June 1995, Steve Wynn, chairman of Mirage Resorts Inc., hosted
a fund-raiser for Senator Robert Dole (R-Kan.) that took in $477,450.
GOP chairman Haley Barbour isn't embarrassed by gambling money.
He said, &quot;It's not my place to be judgmental about issues
when it comes to allowing people to support us...you don't have
to agree with the Republican party on every issue to support us.&quot;[27]
<p>
Wynn is the genius behind the gaming industry's growth explosion,
according to John L. Smith, who writes in<I> Running Scared</I>
that Wynn has &quot;been accused of shadow-waltzing precariously
close to the wise-guy world.&quot; He dealt with a front man for
the Genovese crime family, and one of his associates was a point
man for Chicago mob lieutenant Johnny Rosselli, according to Smith,
who says Wynn was also associated with convicted junk bond felon
Michael Milken.[28]
<p>
The gambling industry understands the importance of politics.
That's why it hired Frank Fahrenkopf, a Nevada lawyer and former
Republican National Committee chairman. He now heads a $4 million
trade group, the American Gambling Association. This group, financed
by the gambling industry, promotes on Capitol Hill the positive
economic benefits of gambling.[29]
<p>
Gambling money and its agents have often been associated with
political corruption. Federal agents are investigating possible
political corruption in Louisiana. In 1995, senior state legislators
allegedly were caught discussing taking bribes from video-poker
lobbyists. Louisiana State Senator Jay Darnemme states, &quot;Greed,
arrogance, money and power -- it's all there....we went into this
very recklessly. Any states considering gambling ought not use
our formula as a model.&quot;[30]
<p>
The speaker of Missouri's House of Representatives resigned under
a cloud of gambling-related political corruption. In August 1991, FBI agents
in Columbia, South Carolina, wrapped up &quot;Operation Lost Trust,&quot;
which resulted in the bribery-related conviction of numerous legislators
and lobbyists.[31]
<p>
Six Arizona legislators pleaded guilty in 1990 to accepting gambling
bribes and that same year seven Kentucky officials were found
guilty of accepting bribes and making false statements. In 1994,
the West Virginia lottery director was sentenced to federal prison
for rigging a video lottery contract.[32]
<p>
The Clinton Administration has been cozy with the Seminole Tribe
of Florida. Clinton's Solicitor General, Drew Days, filed a last
minute, friend-of-the-court brief in the U.S. Supreme Court siding
with the Seminole Indians' case against the state of Florida.
The Seminoles want casino gambling and say Florida has not been
faithful to the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.
<p>
President Clinton's outsider support of the Seminoles waves a
red flag in the face of anti-gambling forces. A check of Florida-based
gaming contributors to the 1996 Clinton/Gore Primary Committee
Inc. found only $6,000, however.[33]
<p>
With annual wagers nationwide now topping half-a-trillion dollars
and gambling profits over $40 billion, there is great opportunity
for corruption.
<p>
<center><h3>GAMBLING AND CRIME</h3></center>
<p>
On October 16, 1995, Joseph Curran, Jr., Maryland's attorney general,
published that state's analysis of the link between gambling and
crime. Curran said, &quot;Casinos would bring a substantial increase
in crime to our state.&quot;[34]
<p>
The Maryland report reflects what virtually every government that
has experienced gambling has found. Jeffrey Bloomberg said, when
casinos came to remote Deadwood, &quot;We have seen individuals
who, prior to their exposure to gambling, had no criminal history,
who were not junkies or alcoholics, many of whom had good jobs,
who became hooked on slot machines and, after losing all their
assets and running all credit resources to their maximum, began
committing some type of crime to support their addiction.&quot;[35]
<p>
Crime on Mississippi's gulf coast increased in every category
after legalization of gambling. Gulfport's chief of police found
overall crime increased more than 100 percent, juvenile crime
shot up 65 percent and alcohol-related accidents increased 101
percent.[36]
<p>
In the first three years after casinos came to Atlantic City,
it went from 50th to first in the nation in per capita crime.
In the first 15 years Atlantic City had casinos, violent crime
skyrocketed almost 500 percent. This was in spite of a 20 percent
population decrease.[37]
<p>
Crime rose 262 percent in Deadwood and police calls in Black Hawk,
Colorado increased from 25 per year before gaming, to as many
as 20,000 today.[38]
<p>
Congressman Wolf testified on September 29, 1995, &quot;Evidence
shows that pathological gamblers engage in forgery, theft, embezzlement,
drug dealing and property crimes to pay off gambling debts. Various
studies indicate that the mean gambling-related debt of people
in compulsive gambling therapy ranged from about $53,000 to $92,000.&quot;[39]
<p>
Durand F. Jacobs, a professor of psychiatry at California's Loma
Linda University and a gambling industry consultant, says that
most people who commit crimes to support their gambling had no
prior criminal records.[40]
<p>
Florida's Department of Law Enforcement studied the probable crime
impact of legalizing gambling and concluded it would cause an
increase in many crime categories. They include: robberies, rape,
theft, drug abuse, aggravated assault, counterfeiting, profit-skimming,
prostitution, credit card scams, loan sharking, and card cheats.[41]
<p>
Given the huge number of dollars involved, gambling legalization
attracts organized crime. Jim Moody, chief of the FBI'S Organized
Crime Section, told <I>60 Minutes</I>, &quot;Gambling itself --
is probably the biggest producer of money for the American La
Cosa Nostra [that] there is.&quot;[42] A former Chicago mobster told
a congressional committee, the introduction of legalized gaming
into Illinois &quot;created a brand new market for us.&quot;[43]
<p>
In 1995, 18 men linked to the Genovese and Gambino crime families
in New York and the Marcello crime family in New Orleans were
convicted of secretly trying to operate a video-poker company
in New Orleans.[44]
<p>
For these reasons Maryland's attorney general Curran warned, &quot;Whatever
dubious financial benefits might flow from casino gaming are outweighed
by the tremendous social costs. Casinos would forever damage the
quality of Maryland life. I urge the task force and the people
of this state to resist the temptation of money that would benefit
too few at the cost of too many.&quot;[45]
<p>
<center><h3>SOCIAL IMPACT</h3></center>
<p>
Americans make more trips to casinos than to major league ballparks,
making gambling the new national pastime. This is evidenced by
the creation of casinos in 23 states and a projection that, by
the year 2000, most Americans will be within a four-hour drive
of a casino.[46]
<p>
This phenomenon is not without social consequences. The American
Psychiatric Association says that gambling addiction parallels
the devastation of alcohol and drug addictions.[47] Although less
than 1 percent of the population have been identified as gambling
addicts, the legalization of gambling could cause that number
to grow to 5 percent, and that includes teenagers.[48]
<p>
Tom Fennelly, a counselor with Gamblers Anonymous, says people
with gambling problems wait to get help until they do something
that bothers their conscience. He told of one woman who became
a prostitute to pay for gambling.[49]
<p>
Robert Goodman reports in the United States Gambling Study that
there are 9.3 million adults and 1.3 million adolescents with
a gambling problem. These are often lower-income residents, and
problem behaviors are worst among the poor and minorities.[50]
<p>
Gambling has caused increased family breakup, suicide, crime,
and massive personal debt. Jason Berg, a 19-year-old from a small
Iowa town, committed suicide after running up gambling debts.
He left a note: &quot;I'm out of control.&quot; Howard Russell,
a 41-year-old salesman, shot himself outside an Illinois casino
after losing more than $50,000.[51] <I>The Kansas City Star</I> reported
the tragic story of a mother who killed herself because she gambled
away the family savings at a casino riverboat.[52]
<p>
The social costs from pathological gambling are high. Peter Reuter,
executive director of the Maryland Task Force on Casino Gambling,
states, there is &quot;no convincing estimate of the average social
costs of an individual becoming a pathological gambler,&quot;
but the &quot;annual costs of $100 million or more in Maryland&quot;
is reasonable.[53]
<p>
Professor Kindt told the House Committee on the Judiciary on September
29, 1995, that the &quot;average socio-economic cost per compulsive
gambler per year has been calculated at $53,000.&quot;[54]
<p>
<center><h3>THE GAMBLER</h3></center>
<p>
Where do gamblers come from? Many gaming supporters count on diverting
funds from other states. They were surprised when a survey by
the Wisconsin Policy Institute of automobile license tags and
the patrons at a Wisconsin-based Indian tribe casino revealed
that nearly 80 percent were local people.[55]
<p>
Paul Dworn, the former editor of a leading gambling trade journal,
argued that most people go to casinos to be entertained: &quot;They
do not go because they have or want to win money.&quot;[56] But gaming
is not like going to Disneyworld or a ball game. It attracts people
who often can't afford the consequences, and it has proven to
be addictive.
<p>
The Wisconsin Policy Institute found that the typical casino gambler
is between 50 and 70 years old and has either retired or has a
blue-collar job. He or she wagers about $101 and loses about half
that amount during each visit.[57]
<p>
A 1995 survey done for the Iowa Department of Human Services found
that the availability of legalized gambling leads to increases
in the prevalence of gambling-related difficulties. Problem gamblers
are increasingly likely to be male, under the age of 30, non-Caucasian
and unmarried. The survey found that 3.5 percent are lifetime
problem gamblers and 1.9 percent are lifetime probable pathological
gamblers.[58]
<p>
Recent studies found lifetime gambling participation rates range
from a low of 74 percent to a high of 92 percent.[59] Iowa's survey
found that respondents spent an average of $40 per month gambling.
Men spend twice as much on gambling as women. People under age
30 spend twice what older gamblers spend. Singles spend more on
gambling ($51 per month) than marrieds ($31 per month).[60]
<p>
The economic strain on gamblers is often crippling. Kansas City's
Family Policy Council found that lower-income households spend
five to 10 times as much per capita on lottery tickets as do middle-income
homes. Since casinos came to Missouri, there has been a dramatic
increase in the number of pawn shops. Today, Kansas City has 38
shops, compared to four in 1979. Twelve shops opened within 18
months of the establishment of riverboat gambling.[61]
<p>
A Kansas City pawn shop owner said, &quot;You see people come
in here who can't afford to buy groceries, but they pawn their
VCR and go to the boat, where they lose $500.&quot; St. Louis'
Gamblers Anonymous reports that gamblers get money from their
life insurance and more than a third actually cancel their policies.
Nearly $1.3 billion of insurance fraud is committed each year
by pathological gamblers.[62]
<p>
The legalization of gambling and the number of pathological gamblers
appear to be linked, and some researchers believe gambling is
the fastest-growing addiction among teenagers. Henry Lesieur, Chair of 
the Criminal Justice Department at Illinois State University, headed a 1991 
panel that studied gambling among college students. The panel surveyed six 
schools in five states and concluded that almost one-quarter of students 
gamble at least once a week.[63]
<p>
Arnie Wexler, executive director of the Council on Compulsive
Gambling of New Jersey, estimates that the number of problem gamblers
will grow as the industry expands. He graphically portrays gambling's
temptation for some. &quot;If you put a guy who wouldn't cheat
on his wife in a room with a gorgeous nude woman, some guys would
fall by the wayside.&quot;[64] While this scenario would not excuse
a man from cheating, Wexler argues that, in the same way, state
approved gambling encourages many people to bet and a certain
percentage will become pathological.
<p>
<center><h3>GAMBLING REGULATION</h3></center>
<p>
Today, there are six major sectors of legal gambling: lotteries,
casino-style gambling, pari-mutuel racing, non-profits (including
bingo and Las Vegas nights), Indian high-stakes bingo and mini-casinos.
Regulating this rapidly expanding industry is expensive and complicated.
<p>
The state of Florida estimated it would cost nearly $50 million
to regulate 34 casinos, and that figure isn't unrealistic.[65] After
all, the 1991 annual budget for New Jersey's Casino Control Commission
was nearly $26 million, and that state's casinos are concentrated
in one city, not spread across a large state.[66]
<p>
But gaming regulation costs don't stop there. The New Jersey Division
of Gaming Enforcement spends another $36 million annually, a portion
of which provides police personnel for patrol and investigative
functions.[67]
<p>
The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 created a federal commission
to set gaming rules and oversee regulation of Indian bingo games.
The federal regulation effort is scanty, however. There are less
than 30 staff persons to regulate hundreds of Indian casinos across
the nation.[68]
<p>
Bob Renneisen, president and CEO, Claridge's Casino, Atlantic
City said, &quot;Our goal is not to get more out of a customer
in three hours but to get him to stay for four hours.&quot;[69] He
figures that the gambler will lose more with time since all casino
games give the house a mathematical edge.
<p>
The industry has studied gambling psychology. The casinos don't
want the gambler to realize he is losing. Jack Binion, owner of
Horseshoe Casino, Las Vegas, said, &quot;What is gambling? It's
really just a hype on emotion.&quot; Bill Zneder, operations chief,
Aladdin Casino, Las Vegas, said, &quot;If you give a guy a $100
bill he looks at it like a round of golf, a golf cart, two beers
and a hot dog. But if you give him chips, it's just betting units
and it loses its value.&quot;[70]
<p>
<center><h3>ADVERTISING GAMBLING</h3></center>
<p>
As governments have become more dependent on gambling, their regulation
efforts have shifted somewhat to promotion. According to gambling
expert Robert Goodman, legislators are tending to legalize-higher-revenue
producing games just as the market is becoming saturated.[71] This
is why public subsidies have been used to help competing private
gambling operations survive.
<p>
Since 1934, the federal government has had a long-standing policy
of prohibiting gambling-related advertising. Current federal criminal
law generally prohibits anyone from broadcasting &quot;[a]ny advertisement
of or information concerning any lottery, gift enterprise, or
similar scheme, [or] offering prizes dependent in whole or in
part upon lot or chance.&quot;[72]
<p>
The law does permit not-for-profit organizations to advertise
if the activity is &quot;clearly occasional and ancillary to the
primary business of that organization.&quot; But that might soon
change.
<p>
Pro-gambling forces in the Senate tried to amend the Telecommunications
Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995 to &quot;allow commercial
gambling enterprises to advertise on radio and television, thereby
reversing a long-standing federal policy against commercial gambling
advertising.&quot;[73]
<p>
State governments already spend more than $300 million a year
in lottery advertisements.[74] Taxpayer funded pro-gambling ads mixed
with industry-paid ads could fill the airways with messages that
promote gambling, thus drawing in more gullible victims.
<p>
<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>
<p>
Despite its popularity, legalized gambling is taking the country
in the wrong direction. Gambling is not an economic savior but
a disease that claims millions of victims.
<p>
President Clinton supports Congressman Wolf's proposal. In a letter
to Senator Simon, Clinton said, &quot;Too often, public officials
view gambling as a quick and easy way to raise revenues, without
focusing on gambling's hidden social, economic and political costs.&quot;
<p>
A national gambling commission could examine and publicize the
devastating consequences of legalized gambling. After the commission,
public policymakers should consider legislation to re-criminalize
or severely limit all forms of gambling.

<h2>FCC PONDERS BIGGER FEDERAL<br>
ROLE IN CHILDREN'S<br>
TELEVISION</h2>

<p>
The Federal Communications Commission is considering a set of
rules that would greatly increase federal oversight of children's
television programming.
<p>
In order to further implement the Children's Television Act of
1990, the FCC is considering:
<p><ul>
<li>Issuing a &quot;more particularized&quot; definition of &quot;educational
and informational&quot; content.
<p><li>Requiring commercial broadcasters to carry a quota of 
&quot;educational&quot; programming, or pay another (probably a Public 
Broadcasting Service affiliate) to carry an equivalent amount of such 
programming.
<p><li>Adopting licensing renewal &quot;processing guidelines&quot;
which would allow the FCC to refuse license renewal to broadcasters
if program quotas are not met.
<p><li>Restricting credit for &quot;educational&quot; fare to designated
&quot;core&quot; programming (which would eliminate consideration
of specials and public service spots that might otherwise be deemed
&quot;educational&quot;).
<p><li>Requiring on-air designations of programs as &quot;educational.&quot;
<p><li>Defining as &quot;educational&quot; those programs for which
educational content is a &quot;significant purpose&quot; of the
show.
<p><li>Excluding for credit any programs that air before 7 a.m. and
after 10 p.m.
<p><li>Monitoring the total amount of educational and informational
programming over a specific time period.
</ul><p>
Given that the worth of specifically &quot;educational&quot; programming
for children is debatable, that public television already provides
many hours of such programming, and that the networks have steadily
increased their &quot;educational&quot; fare in recent years,
it does not appear that an expansion of federal power over television
is warranted.
<p>
More importantly, there are serious First Amendment problems with
any attempt by government to mandate specific programming content.
<p>
<center><h3>BACKGROUND</h3></center>
<p>
In 1989, a U.S. Senate report found that there was &quot;disturbingly
little&quot; programming &quot;that serves the special needs of
children&quot; and that time periods in which children were most
likely to be watching were filled with &quot;reruns of adult or
family comedy, variety, or dramatic programs.&quot;[1] Several cartoon
shows, whose main characters were heavily marketed as toys (such
as G.I. Joe) were criticized by public interest groups as being
little more than show-length toy commercials. Pressure groups
such as Action for Children's Television lobbied hard for some
federal oversight. They found a sympathetic ear in Sen. Daniel
Inouye (D-Hawaii), who sponsored the Senate version of the Children's
Television Act (CTA).
<p>
In 1990, Congress passed the CTA &quot;to increase the amount
of educational and informational broadcast television programming
available to children and to protect children from over-commercialization
of programming.&quot;[2] It was signed into law by President George
Bush.
<p>
The Act limits advertising spots to 10.5 minutes per hour during
weekends and 12 minutes per hour during weekdays.[3] It also prohibits
the advertising of program-based products on the same shows. For
instance, the <I>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers</I> show cannot
include ads for Power Ranger dolls. The Act also directs the FCC
to review, at license renewal time, whether broadcasters have
served the &quot;educational and informational needs of children.&quot;
<p>
In 1991, the FCC issued rules and policies implementing the Children's
Television Act. Television station licensees were required to
respond to the &quot;educational and informational needs of children
16 years of age and under.&quot; No program quotas were established,
and the FCC said it would take into consideration any programming
that served children's &quot;positive development in any way,
including serving their cognitive/intellectual or social/emotional
needs.&quot;[4]
<p>
Irked by some broadcasters' insistence that shows like <I>The
Flintstones, Leave it to Beaver,</I> and <I>The Jetsons</I> meet
the definition of &quot;educational and informational,&quot; the
FCC concluded in a 1993 report that, &quot;We do not believe that
the level of performance is, in the long term, consistent with
the objectives underlying the CTA.&quot;[5]
<p>
Pressure from a coalition of interest groups including the Center
for Media Education, the National Education Association, the National
PTA and others resulted in a renewed effort by the FCC to further
refine the implementation rules for CTA. The coalition proposes
that broadcast licensees be required to provide at least one hour
a day of &quot;educational&quot; children's programming, to be
determined with tougher FCC standards.
<p>
In June 1995, a hearing was held before the full Commission, attended
by broadcasters, interest groups and media. The FCC also asked
for public comment to be submitted in writing, with final comments
and replies being closed on November 20, 1995. More than 600 entries
were filed, from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, private
citizens, TV networks, program providers such as Walt Disney Company,
and many religious and interest groups such as the United Church
of Christ, U.S. Catholic Conference, and the Children's Defense
Fund.[6] Most commentators backed some sort of tightening of the
rules, but the networks and several others argued hard against
program quotas, citing the First Amendment.
<p>
In October 1995, Professor Dale Kunkel of the University of California,
Santa Barbara, released a survey that says some TV stations are
meeting the &quot;kidvid&quot; requirement by airing programs
such as <I>Biker Mice from Mars, America's Funniest Home Videos</I>,
and <I>Yogi Bear</I>.&quot;[7]
<p>
In an Oct. 18, 1995 speech before the National Press Club, FCC
Chairman Reed Hundt cited the Kunkel study, and took particular
aim at NBC's claim that <I>NBA Inside Stuff</I> was educational. 
NBC lawyer Rick Cotton responded that the show
&quot;uses sports to attract teenagers to a program, and then
we provide educational and informational material. This highlights
the problem of government trying to set itself up as the arbiter
of what is educational.&quot;[8]
<p>
<center><h3>THE CASE FOR STATE INTERVENTION ON BEHALF OF CHILDREN</h3></center>
<p>
As noted in the FCC brief filed by the United States Catholic
Conference, &quot;The Supreme Court has not required scientific
exactitude when legislative and administrative bodies take actions
helpful to children and their parents. The Court has deferred
to the judgments of legislators and administrators when harm to
children is at issue.&quot;
<p>
The USCC cites a number of cases in which the court has upheld
state action &quot;aimed at protecting the physical and emotional
well-being of youth.&quot;[9]
<p>
True enough. If public officials depended only on scientific research,
then there would be a pressing need for studies to show that placing
a small child in heavy traffic is dangerous. Some truths are self-evident,
and the general concept of protecting children has been an accepted
societal value in the United States since before its founding.
The only question is how to balance the legitimate public interest
in protecting children with other rights, such as the freedom
of speech, and parental authority. Over the years, the courts
have approved government abridgments of the freedom of speech
when it was determined that children would be unduly harmed without
benefit of such law. Most recently, a federal appeals court in
Washington, D.C. upheld the FCC's right to prohibit indecent programming
between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m., citing the government's
&quot;compelling interest&quot; in protecting children.[10]
<p>
But shielding children from pornography, excessive violence and
coarse language is different from legislating prescriptive programming.
It is one thing to put a health warning label on a pack of cigarettes,
for instance, and another to require all citizens to take vitamins.
Similarly, it is one thing to shield children from smut and another
to require specific broadcasting content determined by government.
<p>
In tackling this thorny issue, the FCC has been lobbied to tighten
the requirements on broadcasters to air &quot;educational&quot;
programs. Here is a closer look at what is proposed.
<p>
<center><h3>DEFINING A MORE &quot;PARTICULARIZED&quot; EDUCATIONAL
AND INFORMATIONAL CONTENT</h3></center>
<p>
Currently, the FCC has broad discretion in defining what is good
TV fare for children. Stations can cite anything aired as part
of their repertoire of child-friendly programming. In 1990, Sen. Daniel 
Inouye provided this definition to convey the intent of Congress:
<p>
&quot;Educational and informational needs encompass not only intellectual
development, but also the child's emotional and social development.
Pro-social programming which assists children to discover more
about themselves, their families, and the world would qualify.&quot;[11]
<p>
The danger in adopting a more refined definition is that it may
lead to a one-size-fits-all, government-designated type of children's
programming. Given the ability of ideologues of various stripes
to commandeer government power to their advantage, expanding the
FCC's power in this way may lead to politically correct programming.
Religious programs might be considered either unimportant or even
detrimental, depending on who is doing the assessment and whose
agenda is being served. As government power grows, religion is
pushed out of the public square by those who expansively interpret
the &quot;wall of separation&quot; between church and state. Also,
concern for &quot;diversity&quot; of lifestyle might weigh more
heavily with the FCC than imagination and dramatic content.
<p>
For example, the Public Broadcasting Service outlet in Akron,
Ohio, aired the one-hour homosexual propaganda show <I>What If
I'm Gay?</I> between <I>Kidsongs TV</I> and <I>Sesame Street</I>,
from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. one Thursday in July 1994.[12] Someone thought
this was suitable educational fare for a preschool audience.
<p>
Appointing an academic panel to come up with suitable definitions,
which some FCC observers have proposed, is also fraught with peril,
since academia has proved to be at least as susceptible as government
bureaucrats to the virus of political correctness. And the networks are not 
immune to the same cultural forces. Turner Broadcasting's <I>Captain Planet</I> 
is often cited as an example of responsible privately-generated programming 
for children, but the show also has been severely criticized by some observers 
for its allegedly radical environmentalist themes.
<p>
<center><h3>QUOTAS FOR EDUCATIONAL TELEVISION</h3></center>
<p>
Any government regulation that forces privately owned broadcasters
to air specified content risks violating the First Amendment guarantee
against forced speech of any kind.
<p>
Courts consistently have allowed only the narrowest exceptions
to this rule. In 1984, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that any government
content rules must be &quot;narrowly tailored to further a substantial
government interest.&quot;[13]
<p>
The U.S. Supreme Court in 1973 upheld the FCC's refusal to force
broadcasters to carry editorial advertisements, saying that such
a move runs &quot;the risk of an enlargement of Government control
over the content of broadcast discussion of public issues.&quot;[14]
In 1974, the Supreme Court upheld the right of a newspaper not
to have to publish government-dictated copy.[15] And in 1986, the
Supreme Court reiterated that &quot;what to say and what to leave
unsaid&quot;[16] were both protected by the First Amendment's prohibition
against &quot;abridging the freedom of speech.&quot;
<p>
In Turner Broadcasting Systems v. FCC (1994), which concerned
whether cable systems could be compelled to carry broadcast signals,
the U.S. Supreme Court said of the FCC that &quot;oversight responsibilities
do not grant it power to ordain any particular type of programming
that must be offered by broadcast stations.&quot;[17]
<p>
The FCC itself has never adopted specific prescriptions of programming,
and has formally rejected such proposals on two occasions.
<p>
Apart from the constitutional question, the FCC would have to
justify such a major government intrusion by proving that 1) there
is an indisputable need for such programming; 2) such programming
does not exist already or 3) children do not have reasonable access
to such programming if it does exist.
<p>
There is very little independent data to indicate that children
are better off watching television -- even &quot;educational&quot;
TV -- than playing, reading or engaging in other activities. In
fact, the drumbeat for &quot;educational&quot; television is part
of a larger lobbying effort in behalf of the concept of early
childhood education. The current, number-one education goal of
the Clinton Administration is that every child &quot;come to school
ready to learn.&quot;
<p>
Declining literacy rates and school test scores have persuaded
some educators to target preschoolers for education, despite the
fact that the presumed benefits of early introduction to formal
learning lack a solid base of research. Just as the supporters
of Head Start have justified its efficacy repeatedly over the
years by reference to a single, nonrepresentative study of 52
preschoolers in a private day-care setting,[18] the educational TV
lobby has based its case for early formal learning on studies
that raise questions of bias.
<p>
In its FCC brief, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting cites
a &quot;1995 report released by Children's Television Workshop&quot;
revealing that &quot;viewing educational television, including
Sesame Street, helps preschoolers in three ways: they are better
prepared to enter school; they perform better on verbal and math
tests as late as age 7; and they spend more time reading.&quot;
Children's Television Workshop produces <I>Sesame Street</I> and
other public TV children's programs. Other data cited by CPB (from
a study commissioned by CPB) indicates that &quot;88 percent of
all preschoolers and 80 percent of all kindergartners watch at
least one of four public broadcasting programs each week -- <I>Sesame
Street, Reading Rainbow, Mister Rogers' Neighborhood</I> and <I>Barney
and Friends</I>.&quot;[19]
<p>
If this is so, then the question must be asked: If PBS educational
television has made such a difference, why have test scores continued
to decline? According to <I>Ready to Learn</I>, a 1991 report
by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, increasing
numbers of pupils are deficient in language skills. Why do children
seem less prepared? Could it be that children have become so addicted
to television that they have difficulty concentrating on real
school work? Could it be that a steady diet of television reduces
a child's attention span more than it educates?
<p>
PBS defenders often cite studies by the Educational Testing Service,
sponsored by Children's Television Workshop, that report significant
gains among young viewers in a number of basic skills such as
counting and naming letters and numbers. A later Russell Sage
Foundation review of the data concluded that the gains were more
modest and that they could be attributed to other factors inherent
in the research method. Also, the Sage study found that the show
increased the intellectual gap between middle-class and poor children,
the opposite of ETA's findings.[20]
<p>
Something of a national sacred cow, <I>Sesame Street</I> is loved
by children and adults alike. Its production values have always
been high, and the content is witty and funny. Big Bird, Bert
and Ernie and other characters have become national icons.
<p>
Touted since its inception as an educational device, the show
is high-quality enter-tainment that parents often will watch with
their children. However, the &quot;educational&quot; effects,
some critics argue, may have been exaggerated to garner public
funding and to alleviate the guilt of parents who let <I>Sesame
Street</I> baby-sit their toddlers for hours on end.
<p>
One <I>Sesame Street</I> critic, Kay S. Hymowitz, even questions
the show's central premise -- that it is good for children. Writing
in the public policy periodical <I>City Journal</I>, Hymowitz
notes that for all its touted &quot;diversity,&quot; <I>Sesame
Street</I> &quot;couldn't be more monocultural and conformist
in its unwavering endorsement of American anti-intellectualism
and [the] cult of the cool.&quot;[21] Hymowitz explains that the skits
trivialize great literature and great events by making them conform
to whatever is current in popular culture, particularly television
shows. She also detects a drumbeat that kids must be &quot;cool&quot;
about everything. Encouraging children to adopt a skeptical approach
to life teaches the &quot;folly&quot; of being passionate about
anything. This can have the side effect of encouraging children
to detach from the beliefs of their parents.
<p>
Hymowitz also notes that <I>Sesame Street</I> &quot;focuses on
mere technical skills, the tools of mental cultivation, rather
than mental cultivation itself; the building blocks of thought
rather than thought....Worse, the show's anti-intellectualism
and its glorification of television culture over print send the
implicit message that the skills of literacy have no meaningful
purpose.&quot;
<p>
Aware that she may come off as something of an Oscar the Grouch,
Hymowitz acknowledges the show's appeal (&quot;who can resist
the clever witticisms of sophisticated television?&quot;) but
stresses that her main concern is the impression that <I>Sesame
Street</I> is an unalloyed educational bonanza.
<p>
No matter how educational <I>Sesame Street</I> appears to be,
if its net effect has been to make school seem dull by comparison,
and to help shorten youngsters' attention spans, then it may not
be such a good idea to promote television viewing of any type
for children. The most powerful argument, outside CTW's own studies,
is that children &quot;are going to watch TV anyway,&quot; which
has some resonance, given the overwhelming evidence that children
do spend many hours in front of the tube.
<p>
Finally, considering the enormous amount of &quot;educational&quot;
programming provided by public television[22] (PBS regularly airs
such popular shows as <I>Sesame Street, Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood,
Barney and Friends, Where in the World Is Carmen San Diego?, Ghostwriter,
Puzzleplace, Shining Time Station</I> and <I>Reading Rainbow)</I>
and the fact that most American children are already tuning into
these shows in large numbers, and the fact that the networks have
increased their &quot;educational&quot; output significantly in
recent years,[23] proponents would be hard pressed to prove that children
have so little access to &quot;educational&quot; television that
an unprecedented government intrusion into content is warranted.
<p>
CTA sponsor Sen. Daniel Inouye noted during debate over passage
of the bill in 1990 that the total programming mix should be &quot;left
to the discretion of the broadcaster, taking into account what
other stations, including non-commercial ones, are doing in this
important area.&quot;[24]
<p>
<center><h3>PROGRAM SPONSORSHIP OPTION</h3></center>
<p>
Public television has nearly monopolized weekly children's programming.
The FCC is considering allowing commercial stations to subsidize
such programming on other channels (such as PBS) as a way to satisfy
their overall duty to serve children's needs. This proposal has
support primarily from the public broadcasting community. In its
FCC brief, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting notes that:
&quot;With CPB at the helm, public television has embraced the
education of America's youth as its core mission for over 25 years.&quot;[25]
CPB promotes the concept of the &quot;program sponsorship&quot;
option in which broadcast licensees would meet a prescribed quota
of children's programming by airing it or by providing &quot;financial
or in-kind support&quot; to &quot;host&quot; stations in the same
market.
<p>
CPB notes that this would result in &quot;shifting programming
dollars to the broadcasters with the greatest expertise in and
commitment to children's educational programming -- the noncommercial
educational broadcasters.&quot;[26]
<p>
CPB also suggests that stations should not be allowed to satisfy
all of the requirement this way, and should provide at least some
educational broadcasts of their own, citing Sen. Inouye's wish
that the FCC &quot;would, of course, expect that each station
will itself broadcast some programming specifically designed for
children to serve their educational and informational needs.&quot;[27]
<p>
Several critics have charged that the formula amounts to a guaranteed
subsidy to Children's Television Workshop, among others. Dr. Laurence
Jarvik of the Center for the Study of Popular Culture calls the
idea &quot;a shakedown by PBS, pure and simple. You might as well
have Big Bird put a gun to their head.&quot;[28]
<p>
Peggy Charren, founder of Action for Children's Television, also
opposes the sponsorship option: &quot;PBS serves the needs of
children now. Allowing stations to simply pay another station
to do programming does not fulfill stations' obligations to serve
the needs of children.&quot;[29]
<p>
Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Media Education,
which lobbies for the new FCC requirements, nonetheless also opposes
the sponsorship option: &quot;The intent of the law was for every
station to air a significant amount of programming for children.&quot;[30]
<p>
Rep. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), who, as chairman of the House telecommunications
subcommittee played an important role in passing the CTA, said
in an interview that &quot;the intent of the Act was not to have
stations pay PBS to do their programming for them.&quot;[31]
<p>
<center><h3>ADOPTING LICENSING RENEWAL &quot;PROCESSING GUIDELINES&quot;
</h3></center>
<p>
Processing guidelines would designate how much &quot;educational
or informational&quot; material had to be included for a licensee
to qualify under any new definitions. They would be the &quot;teeth&quot;
for the FCC to withhold license renewal based on compliance. As
such, they would constitute the equivalent of program quotas,
which would be an infringement of broadcasters' First Amendment
rights.
<p>
<center><h3>RESTRICTING CREDIT FOR &quot;EDUCATIONAL&quot; FARE
TO &quot;CORE,&quot; STANDARD-LENGTH PROGRAMMING ONLY</h3></center>
<p>
In an attempt to ensure regularity of wholesome content, proponents
suggest that broadcast licensees not be able to include specials
and short subjects when they make their case to the FCC that they
have served the &quot;educational and informational&quot; needs
of children. They recommend that only regularly scheduled, 
&quot;standard-length&quot; programs (at least a half-hour in length) be 
counted.
<p>
While the intent seems reasonable, the formula would discourage
imaginative public service announcements generated by the ad industry
and by interest groups. It may also discourage sponsorship of
TV specials.
<p>
The Walt Disney Company, which produces all manner of children's
programming, argued in its FCC brief for the value of non-regular
programming:
<p>
&quot;Certain lessons, for example, can be conveyed best in a
short segment, but might become overbearing or pedantic if relegated
to a 15- or 30-minute format. Anyone who can recall the impact
of the anti-drug commercial depicting a man breaking an egg into
a frying pan and watching it sizzle with the voice-over, 'This
is your brain. This is your brain on drugs. Any questions?,' knows
the unique educational value that such programming can have.&quot;[32]
<p>
<I>Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue</I>, described by NBC as &quot;a
history-making animated anti-substance abuse television special
for children,&quot; was broadcast on all major TV networks and
&quot;hundreds of independent stations and cable outlets throughout
the U.S.&quot;[33] ABC airs the Schoolhouse Rock series during its Saturday 
morning lineup. The animated, three-minute segments are set to music and
have featured such topics as multiplication tables (<I>Zero Is
My Hero</I>), grammar (<I>Conjunction Junction</I>), history (<I>Preamble
to the Constitution</I>), and science (<I>Electricity</I>).[34]
<p>
The Senate Report on the Children's Television Act of 1990 emphasizes
an &quot;overall&quot; assessment of programming to children,
and specifies that the requirement &quot;does not exclude any
programming that does in fact serve the informational and educational
needs of children.&quot;[35]
<p>
An alternative to a ban on counting other than &quot;core&quot;
programs might be for the FCC merely to state that it encourages
more regularly scheduled programming for children as part of a
good-faith effort by broadcasters. Licensees could then score
points by offering more &quot;core&quot; shows, but be able to
present significant short-subject spots as additional proof of
commitment to children's needs. Again, this is contingent upon
acceptance of an increase in the FCC's power over children's programming.
<p>
<center><h3>REQUIRING ON-AIR DESIGNATIONS OF PROGRAMS AS 
&quot;EDUCATIONAL&quot;</h3></center>
<p>
Children are drawn to particular television shows for their entertainment
value. Parents may be far more interested in a show's educational
content. An on-air designation might seem to be a valuable tool
for parents, but it risks the same problems as posed by specific
content regulation. Educational designations could be granted
or withheld arbitrarily or for ideological reasons. The designations
could also have the unintended effect of &quot;warning&quot; children
that &quot;somebody thinks this is good for you, so prepare to
be bored.&quot; Good, entertaining educational fare could wind
up being stigmatized.
<p>
The idea has other problems. As Disney points out, &quot;requiring
an on-air identification attached to a particular program will
serve no such benefit unless the parent is not only watching television
but also watching the particular channel at the moment the identification
is aired.&quot;[36]
<p>
A system to determine such designations would artificially divide
the world of programming into the &quot;educational&quot; and
the &quot;uneducational.&quot; Since the definition of &quot;educational&quot;
is so subjective, and programming does not lend itself to such
draconian division, the system would be unworkable. It is a simple
task to affix warning labels because of specific content, such
as sex, violence or vulgar language, which can be quantified.
But it is another to determine an entire program's subjective
worth as an educational device.
<p>
A reasonable alternative might be to encourage the provision of
published guides on TV content and program guides for parents.
But again, this should not be required.
<p>
<center><h3>DEFINING AS &quot;EDUCATIONAL&quot; THOSE PROGRAMS
FOR WHICH EDUCATIONAL CONTENT IS A &quot;SIGNIFICANT&quot;
PART OF THE SHOW</h3></center>
<p>
When the FCC first proposed new rules for children's TV, the agency
suggested that education must be the &quot;primary&quot; purpose
of educational programs. Now, it has shifted to the stance that
education be a &quot;significant&quot; purpose. This was a reasonable
accommodation, given the power of entertainment to attract viewers.
<p>
<I>Bill Nye the Science Guy</I> is a Disney-produced weekly program
that teaches children about scientific wonders using graphics,
special effects, music video-type sound and comedy.
<p>
&quot;Someone recently asked me to break down into percentages
the entertainment and educational components of our show,&quot;
Nye told an interviewer. &quot;Quite honestly, I couldn't do it.
But I am 100 percent certain that the program is more than 50
percent entertainment -- or kids wouldn't watch.&quot;[37]
<p>
The jury is out as to what exactly is educational fare. Jarvik
notes that even shows such as the Fox cartoon comedy <I>The Simpsons</I>
should not be dismissed as lacking educational content. &quot;While
I don't approve of a foul-mouthed brat, at the least, children
see a family with a father and mother. I suspect that some of
those who disapprove of <I>The Simpsons</I> dislike the idea of
kids seeing an intact, traditional family, and would rather replace
it with something like a cartoon television version of <I>Heather
Has Two Mommies</I>.&quot;[38]
<p>
Moreover, much of the television that children watch is not geared
specifically for them but may, in fact, be educational. What do
children derive from seeing re-runs of <I>The Waltons</I>, for
instance? The hour-long show, in syndication, features a wholesome
Virginia family working out its problems during the Depression.
While not being specifically &quot;educational,&quot; the show
conceivably conveys more valuable information about life to children
than a designated &quot;educational&quot; program.
<p>
<center><h3>EXCLUDING FOR CREDIT ANY PROGRAMS THAT AIR BEFORE 7 A.M. AND
AFTER 10 P.M.</h3></center>
<p>
Proponents of this provision charge that TV stations are airing
some &quot;educational&quot; programs when no one is watching,
in the early hours of the morning, for instance. They want a 7
a.m. standard so that more children would be exposed to educational
content.
<p>
In many markets, public television provides <I>Sesame Street</I>
and other children's shows beginning at 6 a.m. and running throughout
the morning. TV ratings data, as noted in a July 1995 opinion
of the federal D.C. Court of Appeals, show that many children
are viewing television between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m., and even later
into the evening.[39] The Nielsen Company has found that an estimated
1.5 million children aged two to 11, or five percent of all children,
watch TV Monday through Friday at 6 a.m and that an estimated
2.4 million children aged two to 11 (6.3 percent) tune in by 6:30
a.m.[40] Rule proponents contend that this is too small a proportion
of child viewers to make enough difference.
<p>
The networks contend that most educational programming takes place
after 7 a.m. anyway. A study by the National Association of Broadcasters
says that during fall 1994, some 81.4 percent of programs identified
by licensees as &quot;educational and informational&quot; were
broadcast after 7 a.m, with 15.8 percent being aired before 7
a.m.[41] NBC, in its FCC brief, suggests that the FCC give credit
with no time limit, but &quot;if the Commission nonetheless feels
compelled to take some action to allay its concerns in this regard,
we believe it should simply state that licensees must broadcast
some qualifying standard-length programming after 7 a.m. and that
licensees meeting this standard will receive full credit for all
their qualifying programming broadcast during the hours of 6 a.m.
to 11 p.m.&quot;
<p>
Limiting credit to educational fare after 7 a.m. might eliminate
some licensees' obvious dodges, such as scheduling a teen educational
program at 6 a.m. on Sunday morning, when most teens are still
asleep. But it might have an unintended effect of discouraging
<I>any</I> educational programming between 6 a.m .and 7 a.m.,
when up to two million children are watching. Perhaps the FCC
should consider counting as educational fare during those hours
only those programs that appeal to the prime audience during that
time -- small children.
<p>
<center><h3>MONITORING THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING OVER
A SPECIFIC TIME PERIOD</h3></center>
<p>
One of the more arguably valuable functions of government is data
collecting, since this can shed light on a problem. It can also
create issues, and data can be (and frequently is) manipulated
for partisan ends. But at least the government must give everybody
access to the data.
<p>
Outside of the census, there is no constitutional provision for
federal agencies to collect data. The best argument that can be
made is that data collection helps bureaucrats and lawmakers do
their job better, so it adds to the &quot;general welfare.&quot;
<p>
Should the FCC decide to do anything with regard to children's
television, the agency is on the safest grounds in collecting
data on programming. But the enterprise is open to abuse, such
as widely-varying definitions of what constitutes &quot;educational
and informative&quot; programming for children. This brings us
back to the central problem: Is the federal government legally
and practically suited to the task of fine-tuning children's television?
The honest answer is no.
<p>
<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>
<p>
More federal control of children's television programming is not
in the best interests of children and their parents and would
constitute an unwarranted violation of the First Amendment rights
of broadcasters. Children learn in many ways, and government-dictated
designation of some material as &quot;educational&quot; may lead
to politically-correct programming and more government control
of the dissemination of information. The FCC should reject the
proposed rules.

<center><h1>TYRANNY IN ROBES</h1></center>

<p>

<font size=+3>O</font>n May 20, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling 
whose destructive power may rival the infamous <I>Roe v. Wade</I> 
(1973) decision.

<p>

In <I>Romer v.  Evans</I>, the court voted 6-3 to strike
down a voter-approved amendment to Colorado's constitution that
would have prevented homosexuality from being added to civil rights
laws by the state and local governments.  The people of Colorado
had voted for Amendment 2 in response to adoption of homosexual
rights laws in several cities, including Denver and Aspen.  The
amendment took no rights away from homosexuals, merely ensuring
that homosexuality would not receive preferential treatment.

<p>

<center><h3>800,000 Bigots?</h3></center>

<p>

Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the majority, concluded
that the voters were motivated only by &quot;animus&quot; toward
homosexuals, seeking to deny them access to the political process.
In effect, he called more than 800,000 Coloradans &quot;hate-filled
bigots&quot; for withholding a powerful legal weapon from homosexual
activists.

<p>

In a scathing dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia said the ruling
has &quot;no foundation in American constitutional law and barely
pretends to. ... Amendment 2 is designed to prevent piecemeal deterioration
of the sexual morality favored by a majority of Coloradans ... striking
it down is an act, not of judicial judgment, but of political
will.&quot;

<p>

Scalia noted that under the court's reasoning, polygamists
could demand redress because they are disadvantaged by state laws
prohibiting polygamy.  He asked whether the court had somehow
concluded that polygamy was a greater social harm than homosexuality.
Scalia also noted that the majority had completely ignored the
1986 <I>Bowers v. Hardwick</I> case, which established that states
can criminalize sodomy.  If states can do that, he wrote, then
surely they can deny &quot;preferential treatment&quot; to a class
that defines itself solely by its willingness to engage in that
behavior.

<p>

Homosexual activists celebrated the <I>Romer</I> ruling.
Conservative activist Paul Weyrich and Colorado for Family Values
President Will Perkins called for impeachment of the six majority
justices, who include Reagan appointee Kennedy, Sandra Day O'Connor
(Reagan), David Souter (Bush), John Paul Stevens (Ford),  Stephen
Breyer (Clinton) and Ruth Bader Ginsburg (Clinton).  Other leaders
raised the question of judicial term limits and of activating
Congress' constitutional power to limit which cases the Supreme
Court can rule upon.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>
"NOT JUDICIAL JUDGMENT,<br>
BUT POLITICAL WILL."
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

The court did stop short of elevating &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
to the same level of protection as race, ethnicity and other traditional
civil rights categories.  But the legal effect may be less than
the cultural effect.  Within hours of the decision, a lesbian
attorney in Florida said the court had ruled that homosexuality
could not be taken into account in child custody cases.  The court
did no such thing, but such broad interpretations can now be expected
to be routinely advanced in homosexuality-related cases.

<p>

<center><h3>Pass DOMA Now</h3></center>

<p>

Citizens who believe in traditional morality and the rule
of law must now rally around the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA),
a federal bill that defines marriage as &quot;the union of one
man and one woman as husband and wife&quot; and allows states
to ignore out-of-state marriage licenses issued to homosexual
couples.

<p>

Liberal judges in Hawaii are expected to legalize homosexual
&quot;marriage&quot; as early as September, and homosexuals are
preparing to fly to Hawaii, get &quot;married,&quot; and claim
marital status in their home states.  Given the Supreme Court's
usurpation of power in Colorado, passage of DOMA (H.R. 3396) and
(S. 1740) is imperative.  DOMA will reassert the constitutional
authority of Congress, send the courts the message that America
will not surrender to homosexual activists, and secure marriage
against radical redefinition.  So far, 11 states have passed bills
protecting marriage, but DOMA is needed immediately to protect
the federal code and state marriage laws.

<p>

<center><h3>What You Can Do</h3></center>

<p>

Call or write your senators and congressman and urge them
to sponsor DOMA, not merely pledge to vote for it.  The Capitol
Hill switchboard is 202-225-3121.  Addresses:  U.S. Senate, Washington,
D.C.  20510; U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, D.C. 
20515.  Also, ask your state representatives to pass a marriage
protection law at the state level.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>

<p>

<b>Medicare Package.</b> The Medicare trustees issued a report
on June 5 indicating that Medicare Part A (payment for hospital
costs) may become insolvent by 2001.  The Part A trust fund lost
$2.6 billion in 1995.  The trustees recommended that an independent
commission develop a long-term strategy. Congress passed a budget
last year which limited projected increases in Medicare spending
to an annual average of 6.4 percent.  President Clinton vetoed
that plan and insists that Congress enact his more limited proposal.
An election year resolution of this issue is unlikely.

<p>

<b>No Relief in Sight.</b> Family tax relief continues to receive
consideration on Capitol Hill, even as the presidential candidates
float various tax cut plans.  Congressional leaders may include
the child credit in a package with welfare and Medicaid reform,
or include it as part of a separate tax package.  President Clinton
threatens to veto any bill that contains the Republicans' proposed
Medicaid reforms, but it does not appear that he will sign the
tax cuts without comparable cuts in spending.  Sounds like another
&quot;Catch-22&quot; situation.

<p><a name="privacy">

<b>Preventing Predators.</b> The Children's Privacy Protection
and Parental Empowerment Act of 1996 was introduced by Congressman
Bob Franks (R-N.J.) on May 22. The purpose of this bill is to
empower parents to further protect their children from child predators.
The bill would allow parents to learn what information commercial
vendors have obtained about their children, where the information
originated, and where it has been distributed.  People who prey
on children should not be able to purchase, receive, sell, or
in any way handle personal information about children.

<p>

<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>

<p>

<b>No Federal Cradle.</b> Many news stories on the Stand for
Children rally sponsored by the Children's Defense Fund asked
the same questions FRC raised at a press conference the day before
the event:  Is more spending on failed federal programs really
helping children?  Or are liberal advocacy groups just using children
as props to make one last stand for big government?  FRC argued
that strong parents are still the best advocates for children.
Society's role is to help rebuild healthy communities that strengthen
the hands of those who rock the cradles.

<p>

<b>Dues Under Duress.</b> A new House Republican task force on
labor policy has recommended legislation that would protect union
members from being forced to pay dues to fund partisan politics.
In the 1994 election, 40 percent of union members voted for conservative
candidates while union chiefs generally backed liberals.  Giving
workers an option to restrict their dues to collective bargaining
purposes is an obvious way to protect the integrity of representative
government while protecting workers' interests -- and putting
hard-earned dollars back in the pockets of American workers.

<p>

<b>Justice Denied.</b> Some black youngsters in a Washington,
D.C. suburb were almost denied the chance to see how faith and
hard work can pay off in America.  Supreme Court Justice Clarence
Thomas was publicly disinvited to speak at a student awards ceremony
in early June when a school official threatened to disrupt the
event.  Although the school board ultimately voted to reinvite
Thomas, the whole spectacle sent a troubling message to students,
who, fortunately, ultimately got to hear Thomas's powerful message
of personal virtue and equality before the law.

<b>Costly Habitat.</b> From June 3-14 in Istanbul, Turkey, Habitat
II, the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements, built
on the anti-family agendas of previous U.N. conferences, this
time focusing on the environmental and economic challenges of
rapid urbanization.  Urging more efforts to implement that agenda,
Clinton Secretary of State Warren Christopher called for a moratorium
on further U.N. world conferences.  And none too soon.  A recent
General Accounting Office study found that the U.S. Government
spent a whopping $5.9 million on the U.N. Conference on Women
held last September in Beijing, China.

<p>

<b>Rewarding Tyranny.</b> On June 3, President Clinton formally
announced his intention to extend &quot;most favored nation&quot;
(MFN) trade privileges to China.  Unless Congress quickly opposes
Clinton's stand, China will continue to enjoy low tariffs on exports
to the U.S.  FRC opposes extending China's MFN status not only
because the U.S. runs a trade deficit of $34 billion every year
with China, but especially because of China's myriad human rights
abuses, such as forced abortion and sterilization policies, exploitation
of prisoners as slave laborers, and systematic persecution of
Christians.

<p>

<b>Wirth Stumbles.</b> During a Senate Foreign Relations Committee
hearing June 4, chairman Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) put two questions
to witness Timothy Wirth, Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs.
Citing Hillary Clinton's speech during the U.N. Beijing conference,
where she strongly denounced sex selection abortion and mandatory
abortion, Helms asked Wirth if the Clinton administration would
support legislation outlawing sex selection abortion in the U.S.
and admitting refugees fleeing China's coercive abortion policies.
Wirth could not answer either question directly, saying there
were &quot;other implications&quot; which needed to be considered.

<h3>Parental Rights Vote Near</h3>

<p>

The recent pro-big-government &quot;Stand for Children&quot;
rally in Washington, D.C. had little in common with the growing
grass-roots parental rights movement, except for its focus on
children.  The Family Research Council's message to rally participants
was that government programs can never provide what children vitally
need -- parents raising them with love and direction.  Which is
to say, parents are irreplaceable.

<p>

With public school officials handing condoms to pre-teens,
it is no wonder that the parental rights movement has captured
the public's attention.  Parents across the country are finding
their voice against intrusive state and federal governments.
At the state level, parents are supporting constitutional amendments
which protect the right of parents to direct the upbringing and
education of their children without unwanted government infringement.
At the federal level, parents are supporting the Parental Rights
and Responsibilities Act of 1996 (PRRA), which simply codifies
Supreme Court rulings that parents have a fundamental right to
raise their children which the government must respect.

<p>

That parents, not government, should have the primary responsibility
and authority in raising their children seems beyond dispute.
Yet, the ubiquitous ACLU and their education counterpart, the
National Education Association, have weighed in with heavy protests.
They are fond of presenting hypothetical &quot;horror stories&quot;
of child abuse they claim the PRRA will permit, yet the bill specifically
excludes abusive parents from its protection.

<p>

In contrast to these theoretical concerns, real-life instances
of outrageous government violations of parents rights persist.
If the PRRA were law, parents in Pennsylvania would probably
not have had to file suit against the East Stroudsburg public
school for forcing their sixth-grade daughters to undergo vaginal
examinations without their knowledge or consent and over the tearful
protestations of the girls.  This flagrant usurpation of the right
of parents to make health care decisions for their children would
not be tolerated under the PRRA.  Without it, the Pennsylvania
parents have little certainty of success.

<p>

A vote on the PRRA is expected before August.  Call 202-225-3121
and urge your congressman and senators to vote for the PRRA (H.R.
1946; S. 984).  For information on state initiatives, contact
Of the People at 703-351-5051.

<h3>Indecent Opinion</h3>

<p>

The District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania
has ruled against provisions of the Communications Decency Act
(CDA), the first major anti-pornography legislation for cyberspace.
This is a sad defeat with ominous implications for the burgeoning,
new &quot;global community.&quot;  The Clinton Justice Department
will appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.

<p>

The CDA was passed as part of the Telecommunications Reform
bill in February 1996.  It seeks to protect children from sexually
explicit material on the Internet by prohibiting adults from knowingly
sending or displaying &quot;indecent material&quot; to kids.
It imposes criminal penalties for violation of the law.

<p>

The ACLU and a coalition of liberal groups and on-line service
providers filed the challenge to the CDA in Philadelphia.  A similar
challenge was filed in New York and is still pending.  The Family
Research Council and the National Law Center for Children and
Families submitted 400 pages of legal argument and exhibits on
behalf of anti-pornography groups defending the CDA.  Judge Delores
Sloviter, a Carter appointee, headed the Philadelphia three-judge
panel which heard testimony this spring from ACLU and government
witnesses.

<p>

The CDA uses the time-tested standard of &quot;indecency&quot;
to draw the line between material that is appropriate for adults
but not for children.  &quot;Indecent material&quot; is defined
as material depicting or describing sexual or excretory activities
or organs which, in context, is presented in a patently offensive
manner.  The Supreme Court has ruled that adults have a First
Amendment right to receive indecent material and share it with
other adults, but no right to foist it upon children.  The indecency
standard has protected children in the broadcast television, radio,
and telephone media.

<p>

At closing arguments in Philadelphia, it was clear that the
ACLU was not simply quarreling with this particular law, but was
advocating no restrictions whatsoever on the dissemination of
computer pornography to children.  The Philadelphia court was
openly hostile to the Justice Department and its defense of the
CDA, and its ruling absurdly implies that the advancement of Internet
technology depends upon unfettered exhibition of sexual material
to children.

<p>

<font size=+3>W</font>e got a postcard from Air Force Captain Dave Panzera 
the other day.  That's not so unusual, since we receive many calls
and letters from active duty military.  But Captain Panzera's
card came to us from <I>Antarctica.</I>

<p>

That's a dramatic example of how far and wide the
message of FRC is traveling these days.  It's not at all unusual
for us to host meetings with pastors from Southern Africa, champions
of religious liberty from Russia and pro-family leaders from Canada,
Australia and New Zealand.  The international interest in Family
Research Council is a reflection of the global nature of the threat
to the family.

<p>

I always try to give encouragement to our friends from abroad.
They often report feeling &quot;overwhelmed&quot; by a tide of
pornography, drugs, abortion and sexual misconduct.  I share with
our allies some of the expanding array of communications tools
we use to get our message out.  In trying to support them, I find
that <I>I</I> am uplifted. Let me share with you, a regular reader
of <I>Washington Watch,</I> the growing array of devices we have
used in the fight for faith, family and freedom.

<p>

As Americans reduce their reliance on the liberal talking
heads of TV network news, radio has filled the gap.  Sure, there
are the Howard Sterns and Don Imuses, but well-informed pro-family
callers to radio talk shows shatter the media myths about our
movement.  My nickname for conservative programs broadcast from
our nation's capital is &quot;Radio Free Washington.&quot;  I'm
proud that Focus on the Family's news and information feature,
<I>Family News in Focus</I> (FNIF), is broadcast to hundreds of
religious stations every day.  FNIF's Washington bureau, and its
veteran chief, Carl Ramsey, are good neighbors to FRC.

<p>

My daily radio commentary, which bears the same title as
this newsletter, keeps many of you informed of late-breaking
stories and my perspective on the issues.  You can call our FRC
toll-free line at 1-800-225-4008 to obtain a listing of 
participating stations in your community.

<p>

FRC's <I>Legislative Hotline</I> is easily reached by dialing
1-202-783-HOME.  It's available 24 hours a day and is put together
each week (or more frequently as events warrant) by our top-notch
government relations staff.  You can also receive the text of
the <I>Hotline</I> via FAX.  Just call our Government Relations

Our CAN mailing goes out once a month.  Intended for community

<p>

FRC's staff includes some intrepid &quot;cybernauts&quot;
who are using the latest technology to make sure we are represented
on the Internet.  Our site is located at: http://www.frc.org.
I confess I'm a bit &quot;low-tech.&quot; My word processor is
located under my hat, and I carry my printer around in my shirt
pocket.  But for those of you who find that the world begins with
a keyboard, our Internet site should please you.

<p>

When David Brinkley's producers called me recently to appear
on <I>This Week,</I> I was pleased (even if I did have to lock
horns with Rep. Barney Frank).  And CBS-TV's <I>Face the Nation</I> 
gave me yet another opportunity to tout the Defense of Marriage
Act (DOMA).  As gratifying as these major media appearances are,
it's good to know that FRC isn't dependent on others to spread
our message.  We have our own means of getting the word out.
And that word is clearly reaching the ends of the earth.

<a name="compact"><center><h1>An American Compact</h1></center>
<p>
<font size=+3>O</font>ne year after the Republican Contract with America, 
FRC President Gary Bauer has written a book in which he announces &quot;A 
Compact with Our Fellow Americans.&quot; Like the GOP Contract,
this Compact is an effort to put down on paper the goals of a movement. 
It follows in the long tradition of &quot;getting it in writing&quot; which 
has characterized our people's history, from Magna Carta to the U.S. 
Constitution.  Like the Contract, too, it contains 10 key items and invites 
supporters to sign on.
<p>
But the Compact differs in that it seeks to go beyond reforms to be enacted 
by Congress. Rather, it emphasizes actions which Americans can take in their 
homes, churches and communities, even if reform is thwarted in Congress. 
The Compact also differs in that any American, regardless of party ties, 
can freely subscribe to it.  The &quot;Compact with Our Fellow Americans&quot; 
touches on what Alexis de Tocqueville called the &quot;habits of the heart&quot;
which define and preserve us as a free people.
<p>
<center><h3>What We Want</h3></center>
<p>
The Compact is part of Gary Bauer's new book, <i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams:
A Vision for America</i>. The book is being published this month by Focus 
on the Family. <i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</i> is an effort to go directly to 
Americans, to appeal to their hearts, <i>without the reinterpretation and
distortion of the major media</i>. It seeks to answer the question so often 
asked by brusque reporters, but which is also asked with sincerity by many 
of our fellow citizens:  &quot;What do you people want?&quot;
<p>
Bauer states the case for a pro-family America.  He tackles head-on
not only the issues which shape our political choices, but, more importantly, 
those cultural questions, beliefs and actions which determine whether our 
American experiment in ordered liberty will survive at all.  Despite
the facts that we are not at war and that Wall Street's Dow Jones
Index has been daily reaching new highs, most people think our country is 
on the wrong track.
<p>
Bauer recently spoke to this anxiety when he told Dan Rather: &quot;I 
want to see an America where I don't have to worry about date rape when my 
daughter goes out for the first time at college. I want an America where, 
when a young man pledges to love and honor her for the rest of their lives, 
there is a good chance he means it.  I want a country where children come 
first again and where virtue is honored, a place where values matter and 
the American Dream is still real.&quot;
<p>
<i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</i> is not just a policy manual.  It goes behind
today's headlines and tomorrow's talk shows to explore the reasons why 
conservatives defend the family as the fundamental unit of society. It 
describes in detail what this nation would look like if the pro-family
cause were to triumph.  It seeks to summarize the aspirations of families 
and to quell the fears of citizens who have been urged by the polarizing 
media to view &quot;family values&quot; with grave suspicion.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>&quot;MOVE BEYOND<br>
BREAD-ALONE POLITICS...&quot;</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
Even though the book includes over 100 public policy recommendations,
it ultimately resists the temptation to put &quot;our trust in princes,&quot; 
as if the cure for America's ills could be found in Washington. It challenges 
our national leadership to move beyond &quot;bread-alone&quot; politics.  It
includes some thoughtful questions for citizens to ask all candidates
who seek power over us, giving pro-family Americans the chance to shape 
public debate.
<p>
<center><h3>Getting the Word Out</h3></center>
<p>
Look for <i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams: A Vision for America</i> at your local
Christian bookstore, or use the enclosed card to order from us.  Urge your 
neighborhood group, your church, your public library to obtain copies. 
Share them with family and friends who may be sympathetic but skeptical. 
This is a year of decision.  The decisions that are made will shape the world 
our children inherit.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>
<p>
<b>Kinsey's Pedo-File.</b>  U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman (R-Tex.) has introduced
a bill, with over 40 cosponsors, calling for federal investigation into the 
infamous Kinsey sex studies.  The &quot;Child Protection and Ethics in 
Education Act&quot; also calls for a cut-off of federal funds to programs 
that use the Kinsey research uncritically.  Media attention continues
to build regarding Kinsey Institute Director John Bancroft's admission that 
a key table on child sexuality was based on the records of a single pedophile. 
FRC has publicly called on the Institute to identify all of its pedophile 
sources.
<p>
<b>In the Dark.</b> What had originally been slated as a House hearing
to expose &quot;the homosexual agenda in schools&quot; turned into a 
mostly watered-down exercise on &quot;parents, schools and values.&quot; 
The Dec. 5 and 6 hearing drew little media coverage.  Virtually
ignored was shocking testimony by avowed lesbian Claire Connelly of 
Ventura County, California, who gave evidence that millions of taxpayer 
dollars' worth of AIDS programming is being hijacked by homosexual activist
groups. The hearing was held by the House Subcommittee on Oversight
and Investigations.
<p>
<b>Not with My Kid.</b>  A hearing was held in November on the Family
Privacy Protection Act (H.R. 1271), which requires researchers to get 
written parental permission before administering surveys to children. 
FRC's Robert Knight supported the bill in testimony before the Senate 
Committee on Governmental Affairs.  Knight said the law is needed because 
some researchers are prying into family matters and/or asking children 
graphic questions about sex. The FRC video about Alfred Kinsey, <i>The 
Children of Table 34</i>, was submitted to the committee to illustrate 
research run amok.
<p><a name="abortion">
<b>Life Gains.</b> On Dec. 7, the Senate passed the Partial-Birth Abortion
Ban Act, 54-44.  Since the Senate-passed version has been amended slightly, 
a final version still must be approved by the House, possibly by the end of 
January.  After final congressional approval, the bill will go to
President Clinton, who threatens to veto it.  While thousands of Americans 
are calling the White House about this legislation, it is also important to 
educate your neighbors by writing letters to the editor and calling talk 
radio programs.
<p>
<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>
<p>
<b>Slippery Summit.</b> Ever since the 1989 governors' education summit
in Charlottesville, Va., produced the National Education Goals and 
prompted Goals 2000, Americans are rightly suspicious of such gatherings. 
When word got out last summer about a follow-up meeting to recommit to 
the national goals, the ensuing uproar scuttled the meeting. Now a summit 
is scheduled for March 26-27 in Palisades, New York.  Business leaders
have been invited to join governors to discuss opportunities for participation 
in the Goals 2000 school restructuring. Unfortunately, a new partner in a bad 
venture won't improve it.
<p>
<b>Holiday Spirit.</b> On Dec. 19, Andrei Codrescu, a commentator on
National Public Radio's <i>All Things Considered</i>, said this about 
the Christian concept of Rapture: &quot;The evaporation of four
million who believe in this crap would leave the world a better
place.&quot;  The taxpayer-funded NPR issued an apology. The week 
before Christmas, NPR also devoted considerable air time to commentators 
who tried to debunk Christianity.  And it was business as usual over 
at PBS, which re-aired the sexually explicit homosexual series <i>Tales 
of the City</i>.

<p><a name="npr">
<b>New Allies?</b> While the fate of the GOP's $500 per child tax credit
remains tied up in the budget deadlock, the National Parenting Association 
(NPA), a liberal academic group, has begun to lobby for pro-family tax cuts. 
On Dec. 15, an NPA youth violence task force hosted testimony
from representatives of Promise Keepers, the Christian pro-fatherhood
group that reached 826,000 men in 1995.  Meanwhile, a new Heritage Foundation 
study shows that the Clinton family tax cut covers 23 million fewer children 
than the GOP proposal.
<p>
<b>Maine Rebounds.</b> Pro-family forces have won a big victory in the
Pine Tree State.  For the first time in 20 years, Maine legislators won't 
face homosexual rights legislation in 1996.  An openly lesbian state 
senator withdrew the bill, citing the need for &quot;healing&quot;
on the issue.  But the real reason was the bill's certain defeat.  In 
November, voters narrowly rejected a statewide referendum that would 
have struck down local gay rights laws.  Outspent 10 to one, pro-family 
forces still snagged 47 percent of the vote, sending lawmakers a message.
<p>
<b>Saving Marriages.</b> Divorce reform is gaining momentum in the new
year.  Michigan and Iowa are among states likely to consider bills that 
reintroduce the fault concept in contested cases where children are present. 
Randy Hekman, head of the Michigan Family Forum, a member of the Association 
of State Policy Councils, points out that under current law, &quot;I can 
divorce my wife of 26 years with less difficulty than I can fire a 
secretary I hired last week.&quot;

<h3>Cyberprogress</h3>
<p>
At the end of 1995, staff members for the House and Senate
conferees on the large telecommunications deregulation bill came to 
agreement on strong pornography restrictions, but only after a series 
of tough negotiations.  Leaving pornography unrestricted in cyberspace 
would be like leaving a loaded gun on a playground.  If the &quot;telecom
bill&quot; is passed, the anti-cyberporn language will help parents protect 
their children by making pornography inaccessible by children.
<p>
Highlights of the cyberporn provisions as negotiated include:
<p><ul>
<li>Use of a court-approved indecency standard, defined in
the bill as an <b>&quot;image or other communication that, in context, 
depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by 
contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities or 
organs&quot;</b>;
<p>
<li>Indecent communications are available to adults but <b>barred
to children</b>;
<p>
<li>People are liable only for <b>knowing violations</b> of the law;
<p>
<li>Online service providers are not liable for violations beyond areas 
they own or control;
<p>
<li>E-mail privacy laws are left unchanged;
<p>
<li>Those making good faith efforts to keep pornography away
from children have a defense against prosecution.
</ul><p>
Contrary to much of the current rhetoric from civil libertarians,
the anti-cyberporn provisions could not be used to find Shakespeare or 
any other serious work of literature or art to be indecent. Adults with 
common sense do not confuse art and literature with patently offensive
materials which degrade women, harm children, and corrupt men.
Under the indecency standard, the courts will be obliged to evaluate 
material in its proper context.
<p>
A few other provisions of the bill remained unresolved as <i>Watch</i> 
went to press. Congressional leaders should make every effort to conclude 
these matters as soon as possible, so that we do not risk losing the 
opportunity to protect our children from the cultural poison of cyberporn.
<p>
FRC's legal policy director took part in the negotiations leading to 
these provisions.  In the past, telecommunications reform has happened once 
a generation. FRC will continue to monitor this legislation in the days 
to come.

<h3>FRC: Ready and Abel</h3>
<p>
FRC's Military Readiness Project (MRP) is challenging the Clinton
administration's military personnel policies in the courts.  On Dec. 5, the 
MRP had the rare privilege to make oral arguments before the U.S. Circuit 
Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., in the case of <i>Thomasson v. Perry</i>. 
Thomasson is an avowed homosexual who wants the military's ban declared 
unconstitutional.  The MRP defended the law's intended meaning, while
the U.S. Justice Department hid behind the Clinton administration's faulty 
regulations.  A decision is expected in April.
<p>
Last summer, the MRP filed a brief in <i>Abel et al. v. U.S.A.</i>, which
involves six avowedly homosexual service members.  This case was scheduled 
for oral argument in the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan on Dec. 
19.  That hearing was delayed after a Clinton-appointed judge was reminded 
that he had made a biased comment about the issue.  The hearing was re-set 
for mid-January with a decision expected this spring.  This case will
compete with <i>Thomasson</i> for a high court hearing next year.
<p>
On other fronts, the MRP worked with key members of Congress
to close a loophole in President Clinton's regulations on homosexuals. 
In response to Hill queries, the Pentagon's general counsel wrote a 
memo to the services clarifying Clinton's &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; 
regulations which say that &quot;sexual orientation&quot; is not a bar to 
military service. The memo was necessary because last summer a Navy 
administrative board used the faulty regulations to retain an avowed lesbian 
who promised to avoid homosexual acts.
<p>
Meanwhile, on Dec. 15, the MRP filed a Supreme Court brief in
<i>U.S.A. v. Commonwealth of Virginia</i> (the Virginia Military Institute 
case).  The Clinton administration wants the high court to impose a 
&quot;strict scrutiny&quot; standard which would make all classifications 
by gender very hard to defend legally.  With high court approval, this would 
amount to back-door adoption of the Equal Rights Amendment, reviving old 
debates about everything from the Boy Scouts to unisex bathrooms. It would 
also remove most gender-based exemptions in the military, like women serving
in infantry units.  The FRC brief argues that gender classifications
should be subject to a less exacting standard.

<center><font size=+2><b><i>Hope Is a Hand-up</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer</center>
<p>
<font size=+3>J</font>ust before Christmas, Family Research Council hosted 
an important event in Washington.  It was a one-day conference, with 
distinguished speakers like authors Michael Novak and Dr. Marvin
Olasky.  The conference was devoted to the tragedy of poverty, with a 
close look at the tricky question of welfare reform.
<p>
I'm more convinced than ever that we must look with new eyes at
the scale of this tragedy.  It's really not enough to say that certain 
kinds of welfare reform will cause suffering.  We have to come to terms 
with the degree of suffering that is happening right now -- and not just 
suffering from material want, but from the sense of purposelessness that
saps the human spirit.
<p>
Those of us who believe most fiercely in the durability of traditional
values are precisely the ones to stand up now and say that every individual 
has qualities that no welfare system should be allowed to destroy. FRC 
recognizes that the best and most compassionate help comes from
private individuals who build personal relationships and offer
material support simultaneously. A hand-up not a handout. The premise is 
that needy individuals are not &quot;clients,&quot; but fellow human
beings.
<p>
America cannot implement neat, clean, top-down policies that will
jumpstart a network of caring in every community.  Instead, each of us must 
take direct action to heal the hurt -- not at the ballot box, but in our 
neighborhoods and communities as we minister daily to needy individuals.
<p>
One happy byproduct is that our own children, by watching our
example, will grow to appreciate what is great and good.  Even strong 
parents depend on the interplay of thoughtful neighbors to help pattern 
right habits of the heart.
<p>
FRC is taking the initiative to encourage a new ethic of caring
because, I believe, social conservatives are the very people who have the 
idealism and initiative to build up a new network of helping institutions. 
As we have begun to speak out, we have discovered that the scale of the
crisis is an unprecedented opportunity for us to demonstrate, in full 
technicolor action, a fundamental truth:  Traditional values are traditional 
because they are functional.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>TRADITIONAL VALUES<br>
ARE<br>
FUNCTIONAL VALUES</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
When nothing else moves the needle, God's ways work.  His love
binds up wounds.  Our service to those who are hurting is one of the most 
obvious means we have at our disposal to let earth know what heaven looks like. 
God's love looks most beautiful, in fact, against a backdrop of despair.
<p>
Dr. Virgil Gulker, founder of Kids Hope USA, tells a story about
one small step in a child's journey to God.  Kids Hope USA aims to link adult 
volunteers in one-to-one relationships with at-risk children. This Christmas 
season, one volunteer took &quot;her child&quot; to see a Christmas pageant
at her church that included a living nativity.  As Mary, Joseph,
and the baby Jesus took their places, the child Amanda turned to her new 
friend and asked with wide eyes, &quot;Is this real?&quot;  The volunteer 
replied, &quot;Oh yes, Amanda, it's very real.&quot;
<p>
That moment almost undoubtedly left a mark on Amanda's soul. In time, 
I suspect, she will be much more likely to regard that scene as real 
because one of God's loving servants was sitting by her side.

Freshmen members of the House of Representatives are in the media
glare as the budget dispute continues between Congress and the White House. 
The first-termers have been called both &quot;principled citizen 
legislators&quot; and &quot;inflexible extremists.&quot; What's the 
reality?
<p>
Nearly all of the freshmen have strongly endorsed term limits
and committed to do what they think is right, regardless of short-term 
political consequences. They want a balanced budget and tax relief for 
America's families.  Their insistence on these policies led to stronger 
agreements with the Senate than first seemed possible.  They have been 
just as tough in negotiations with the White House.
<p>
Moreover, despite President Clinton's opposition, the freshmen
have helped to restore two abortion limitations that were overturned 
during the last Congress: limits on abortion funding through federal 
health insurance programs and a ban on elective abortions in overseas 
military hospitals.
<p>
Freshmen House members also helped sidetrack a bill to fully fund
the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA).  Their efforts forced the House 
leadership to zero out NEA funding within two years.
<p>
The principles of this freshman class will be further demonstrated
in 1996 as they strive to move parental rights and religious liberties 
legislation through Congress. They are truly making a difference on issues 
vital to pro-family Americans.

<a name="budget"><center><h1>KEEPING BUDGET<br>
REFORM ON TRACK</h1></center>
<font size=+3>W</font>hite House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta and Senior Counselor
George Stephanopoulos know the drill well. They are using today
the same tactics they employed in 1990 when they successfully
maneuvered President George Bush into breaking his &quot;no new
taxes&quot; pledge. Today, they decry &quot;a train wreck&quot;
they say will occur if Congress makes spending cuts stick. 
<p>
First, some background. The U.S. Government will begin the 1996
Fiscal Year October 1.  Congress has spent the last nine months
paring down Clinton budget requests, eliminating billions in future
wasteful spending, and pushing for a balanced budget by 2002.
<p>
House Republicans earlier this year passed a FY 1996 budget resolution
that calls for a balanced budget by FY 2002.  They tried to cut
federal taxes by $354 billion over the same seven-year period,
but Senate liberals limited tax relief to  $245 billion. Clinton
and his  congressional supporters vigorously denounced both the
proposed tax cuts and the 2002 balanced budget target. 
<p>
<center><h3>Media's False Picture</h3></center>
<p>
Journalists describe the major difference between Congress and
the president as a dispute over whether to balance the budget
in a seven-year or ten-year period.  However, the Congressional
Budget Office's (CBO) analysis of Clinton's  proposed budget found
a $209 billion shortfall in the year 2005 -- the very year that
he claims to achieve a balanced budget.  His ten-year proposal
also produces <i>$2 trillion in new federal debt</i>.
<p>
Liberal critics of the GOP budget plan attack the tax cuts, claiming
that they favor the rich or that they will gouge Medicare.  They
claim the tax cuts will &quot;explode the deficit,.&quot;  But
more than half (55 percent) of the House-passed tax relief is
dedicated to the $500-per-child tax credit.  And approximately
three-quarters of this tax credit is slated to go to families
with incomes less than $75,000;  nearly five million families
at the lowest levels will be freed from federal income taxes.
Senate GOP leaders have strongly suggested that the final composition
of the tax package will be very &quot;family friendly.&quot;
<p>
Conservatives see savings in the cuts in discretionary spending
programs and welfare reform.  They also note that Medicare spending
is projected to <i>increase at twice the rate of inflation</i>
even as reforms are instituted to restrain the rate of growth.
 The argument that tax cuts &quot;explode the deficit&quot; is
answered by pointing out that <i>tax revenues</i> actually increased
by more than the rate of inflation during the 1980s.  If spending
increases had been held to the rate of inflation, we'd have a
budget surplus today. 
<p>
Not a penny can be spent unless both houses approve. This gives
the GOP tremendous leverage to set conditions on the use of taxpayers'
money. Funding battles are also battles over abortion, federal
subsidies for pornographic art, the gay agenda and liberal legal
activism. Congress has an obligation to use its &quot;power of
the purse&quot; to protect the legitimate interests of the American
family.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>BUDGET "TRAIN WRECK"<br>
WON'T HAMPER ESSENTIAL<br>
SERVICES</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><h3>A Contest of Wills</h3></center>
<p>
Who will blink first, Bill Clinton or Congress?  Both sides may get
through October by short-term "continuing resolutions," but by early November,
the Treasury's authority to borrow money will expire.
 Congress can then apply conditions to legislation to raise the debt ceiling. 
If the budget dispute is not resolved by then, a real clash will occur. But 
<i>essential services</i> like mail delivery, air traffic control and Social
Security checks will continue during this dispute. Doubtless there will
be a great hue and cry from the liberals who see their funds disappearing.
<p>
A government shutdown poses great risks for liberal interest
groups.  What happens if a few weeks go by and the public
doesn't miss the &quot;services?&quot;  That would provide a very
powerful argument for reducing spending even further. Our national
debt and much of our cultural decline have been the products of
several decades of reckless government spending. If it takes a
 liberal &quot;train wreck&quot; to get our country back on track,
that may be a small price to pay.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>
<p>
<a name="porn"><b>Calculating Moves.</b> The cyberporn debate has gone behind closed
doors during Congress' recess.  FRC has participated in several
meetings to work on a package to address this menacing aspect
of exciting new communication technology.  Later this month, Congress
will make final decisions about bill language.  Lawmakers should
stand firm in their commitment to enact strong laws against this
exploitative material, and not be swept in by the liberals' false
promise of &quot;parent-empowering&quot; software.  The software
might help, but it is no more a substitute for strong pornography
laws than bullet-proof vests are a substitute for laws against
homicide.
<p>
<b>Saving Health Care.</b> The Clinton health care plan is dead but the
issue of health care reform is still alive.  Escalating health
care costs are one of the biggest threats to the current system.
Congress is likely to consider  H.R. 1818, introduced by Reps.
William Archer (R-Texas) and Andrew Jacobs (D-Ind.), to allow
tax-free medical savings accounts in which families or individuals
set up a special account for lower-level health care expenses,
typically around $2,500.  The benefit is the account is tax free,
portable, and can carry over from year to year for future health
needs. HR 1818 has 90 cosponsors. In the Senate, Chuck Grassley
(R-Iowa) has taken the lead in pushing the medical savings account
concept.     
<p>
<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>
<p>
<b>Quarterback Kemp.</b> The 14-member commission on taxes headed by
former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp, is
expected to give its report to the congresssional Republicans
 in October.  The commission examined a flat tax plan (with no
deductions), a national sales tax, and other proposals to simplify
the tax code.  Pro-family advocates will be especially interested
in how the commission handles tax treatment of families, charitable
contributions, and home ownership.
<p>
<b>New Security Order.</b> President Bill Clinton Aug. 4 signed an Executive
Order barring the federal government from denying security clearances
to homosexuals.  The 13-page order &quot;establishes a uniform
Federal personnel security program&quot; for all federal employees
to include members of the military and commercial contractors.
 It states, &quot;No inference...may be raised solely on the basis
of the sexual orientation of the employee.&quot;  Homosexuality
has long been a red flag for national security officers performing
background investigations  because it is so often linked to known
security risks, such as drug and alcohol abuse, promiscuity and
violence.
<p>
<b>Gay Asylum, Yes. Moms, No.</b> While Mrs. Clinton talked about advancing
women's rights during the Beijing conference, 13 Chinese women
were being imprisoned by the United States and awaiting deportation
back to China. Their crime?  Fleeing China's forced abortion policies.
 Even though these Chinese women will face extreme punishment
in slave labor (Lao Dai) camps or even death if they are returned
to China, Bill Clinton has refused to grant them asylum.  In a
reversal of the Reagan-Bush immigration policy, Clinton declared
that forced abortion was no longer grounds for political asylum.
He has instead extended asylum to homosexuals fleeing &quot;persecution.&quot;
<p>
<a name="polls"><b>Polls Go South.</b> Recent public opinion polling suggests 
that Americans are not altogether pleased with Congress. A <i>Wall Street 
Journal/NBC News</i> poll found that 53 percent of respondents <i>disapprove
</i>of Congress' performance and only 36 percent approve, while
a <i>New York Times/CBS News</i> poll found a 56 percent disapproval
rating and a 31 percent approval rating for Congress.  Interestingly,
however, according to a <i>Times Mirror</i> poll, the Republican
party is ahead of the Democratic party by a greater margin than
when they swept Congress last November -- 50 percent to 43 percent.
 Taken together, these results suggest that Americans are less
satisfied with the pace of change than the direction of change.

<h3>Children's Defense?</h3>
<p>
<font size=+3>W</font>hile President Bill Clinton's anti-smoking campaign grabbed
headlines, his administration went to court against a South Carolina
university hospital's very successful mandatory drug testing/treatment
program for pregnant cocaine-addicted women. Mothers who refuse
treatment for themselves and their unborn children would face
arrest and jail time. The program works. Most women stayed drug-free
during their pregnancy. Still, Clinton's aides charged that South
Carolina's program was punitive and violated the addicted mother's
&quot;privacy rights.&quot;  Is the health and well-being of unborn
children less important than those who already born?
<p>
<a name="aids">Then there is the issue of 7,000 deliveries per year in U.S.
to HIV-infected women. About 2,000 of these infants are infected
with HIV. Rep.Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), who is a medical doctor, and
Rep. Gary Ackerman (D-N.Y.) plan to offer an &quot;infant testing&quot;
amendment to the Ryan White Care Act (H.R. 1872/S. 641) that would
require states -- in order to qualify for federal Ryan White Care
funding -- to pass laws requiring every newborn be tested for the
HIV virus if mother does not (voluntarily) undergo prenatal
testing.  The amendment would require the test results to be told
to mothers, and it also encourages HIV counseling, testing and
treatment of pregnant women.
<p>
According to Dr. Coburn, his amendment is an important step in
combating AIDS.  &quot;In fact, studies have shown that the rate
of transmission of the virus from mothers to children can be reduced
by two-thirds if the drug AZT is administered during pregnancy,
labor and the first six weeks after birth,&quot; Coburn explains,
&quot;Knowing the status of the baby right away would allow treatment
and counseling to begin immediately and prevent an uninformed
mother from transmitting HIV to her baby through breast feeding.&quot;
<p>
Presently, 45 states require up to <i>nine</i> mandatory generic
newborn tests, such as syphilis and hepatitis, but not HIV. As
a public health issue, the incidence of AIDS in infants requires
that common sense become public sense.

<h3>Defending our Defenders</h3>
<p>
<font size=+3>F</font>RC has filed an <i>amicus curiae</i> (&quot;friend of 
the court&quot;) brief with the U.S. Supreme Court in the &quot;Amendment 2&quot;
case.  Media reports contend that <i>Romer v. Evans</i> will decide
whether the Constitution allows Colorado to &quot;discriminate
against&quot; homosexuals. Wrong. The case is really about
whether the people of Colorado may decide not to grant special
protected legal status to this &quot;class&quot; of persons.
 The Supreme Court justices will hear oral argument in the case
 Oct. 2.    
<p>
<a name="gay">In the military, homosexual servicemen have begun filing lawsuits
to block their discharge.  FRC is working on the following cases:
<ul>
<li>In <i>Philips v. Perry</i>, FRC filed the winning brief calling
for the dismissal of a case filed by a homosexual sailor seeking
to block his discharge.  In the case, Philips admitted past sexual
misconduct and his intention to engage in future misconduct. 
The federal district court dismissed Philip's case, and FRC is
preparing another brief arguing against his appeal.  
<p><li>A federal district court June 9 upheld the military's policy
on homosexuality in <i>Thomasson v. Perry</i>.  The ruling was
based upon the pre-1993 exclusion policy, not on the Department
of Defense's  (DoD) new &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; regulations.
 This is significant.  The Clinton administration has argued that
its 1993 change in policy was necessary to avoid constitutional
problems, but the Thomasson ruling shows that the &quot;old
rules&quot; were constitutionally sound.  Thomasson has appealed
this ruling to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, and FRC has
filed a brief supporting the constitutionality of the old policy.
</ul><p>
The <i>new</i> DoD regulations were the subject of a challenge
in the case of <i>Able v. U.S..</I> The federal district court
judge in Able ruled that six service members' First and
Fifth Amendment rights were violated when the military sought
to discharge them solely based on their open admission they were
homosexuals, and ruled that the Pentagon was enjoined from discharging
them.  Attorney General Janet Reno has appealed the ruling, but,
given the Justice Department's  lackluster performance so far,
FRC does not anticipate a vigorous effort at the appeals court
level.  FRC has filed an <i>amicus</i> brief setting forth all
of the key arguments for prohibiting service by avowed homosexuals
which the Clinton administration has ignored. FRC's efforts have
been undertaken by the Military Readiness Project, a joint task
force of FRC and senior retired military leaders.

by Gary L. Bauer</center>
<p>
School's back. The bumper stickers on buses remind us to be careful
of the youngsters. Time was when accidents going to and from school
were the main worry of parents. No more. Today, we have concerns
about violence and drugs in schools. Many parents are troubled
by efforts in school to undermine the values and beliefs the kids
are taught at home. And, of course, there's OBE. Outcome-based
Education is the latest in a long line of educational fads that
have dumbed down American classrooms. 
<p>
<center><h3>&quot;Re-structuring&quot; SATs</h3></center>
<p>
Now, it seems, even the SATs have been affected. The Scholastic
Aptitude Tests have been  an important measure of how well our
young people are doing.  I remember during my service as President
Reagan's Undersecretary of Education how we pointed to the 85-point 
skid in SAT scores (1960-80) as indisputable proof of educational
decline. We even prodded a sluggish education establishment to
cough  up the extensive data we published as &quot;the Wall Chart.&quot;
That chart demonstrated that many of the states which spent the
least per pupil nonetheless produced students with the highest
scholastic aptitude. Was I unpopular with the bureaucrats!
<p>
Despite a 93 percent spending hike in the 1980s, the education
establishment continued to crank out under-prepared graduates.
So the SATs have been subjected to steady criticism from liberals.
Finally, the College Board has responded. With great fanfare,
education leaders announced that this year's scores were -- UP!
That <I>would</I> be great news except for some inconvenient truths.
First, this is a new and improved SAT test. They call it SAT I,
but its real name should be <i>SAT-lite.</i> It has fewer
questions, but it allows students 30 minutes more to finish. The
designers of SAT-lite have thrown overboard the more challenging
antonyms section, making it easier to score high on the the verbal
portion of the exam. Oh, and it's now OK to use a calculator.
No more unfair advantages to those grinds who memorized their
times tables! 
<p>
Test-makers say  they have changed the SATs in order to keep
up &quot;with what and how students are learning today.&quot;
What and how students learn today is increasingly determined by
President Bill Clinton and Education Secretary Dick Riley under
their ill-conceived &quot;Goals 2000&quot; legislation. Of course,
the College Board disclaims any attempt to dumb down the SATs.
But they are funded by the U.S. Department of Education. We could
hardly expect them to bite the hand that feeds them. With these
new SAT-lite test results, the Clinton administration will be
able to reassure concerned parents: &quot;See, our reforms are
working!&quot;  But this is the same team that called the State
of Ohio on the carpet last year for requiring high school graduates
to pass an eighth grade-level test. The Clinton administration
said those tests might be racially discriminatory.

<center><h3>Excellence the Goal</h3></center>
<p>
Make no mistake: pro-family Americans don't want kids
to fail in school. We believe that a stress on solid academic
basics, giving special needs children the extra help they may
require, is the best way to progress. We believe in competition
and a commitment to excellence. We know that parents are the key
to real education progress. And we think parents should be able
to choose the safe and challenging school that meets their childrens'
needs. We don't believe it helps anyone artificially to try to
build up a child's self-esteem by lowering the standards. Minority
children, as well as special needs kids and rural kids, can achieve.
The pursuit of excellence helps everyone.

Dear Cleta,

I am interested in helping organize a group of neighbors for a specific 
cause. Without too much detail, let me briefly explain the problem.
In a middle class neighborhood in which the residents are hard working,
honest citizens, an individual has recently purchased a house citizens,
an individual has recently purchased a house for the purpose of renting
it out. The individual is developing a pattern of renting to people 
who seem to be prone to criminal activity. The house has become a slum 
in the middle of the neighborhood. There has been constant traffic in 
and out of this house and subsequently the neighborhood. Some of these
individuals are known drug users. There have been people sleeping in 
junk cars on the property. There have been numerous residential 
breakins. Several neighbors have witnessed pot smoking in the front 
yard by some of the seven adults that live there. The response from 
the landlord, who lives in another part of town but whose ex-wife lives
next to the rental property, has been something like, "Well, they pay 
their rent on time."

Can we do anything not only to clean the situation up but to also 
prevent the landlord from repeating the act over and over?

A concerned citizen
</pre>
<p>
Dear Concerned:
<p>
<dd>Good for you for taking on illegal activities in your neighborhood!  Keep 
in mind the 3 things you must do to win this fight: 1) gain allies and friends 
2) document everything and 3) make as much noise as you can among decision 
makers. Big shots hate 
noisy constituents.
Some specific suggestions:
<ol>
<li>Document the incidents you wrote about, including the residential break-ins.  List dates and times; take photographs and keep taking them every couple of days.  Build a file.
<li>Check your zoning laws.  Do the laws for your neighborhood permit rental to other than single families?  If not, report (in writing) the violation of the law to your planning and zoning commission, with the documentation.  There are probably also zoning laws about "eyesores" and "public nuisances".  Talk to the city attorney's office in your community and find out what the law is and what the procedures are for getting city action.  You're paying the city attorney--use his/her services as much as possible.
<li>Circulate a petition in your neighborhood. Get signatures from as many of  your neighbors as possible on a petition calling on the landlord to evict the current tenants and supervise the property more carefully.  Rouse the rabble on your side.
<li>Send copies of the petitions and documentation to:
<dd>-- your local elected officials;
<dd>--your local newspapers.  Contact the "metro" section, not the editorial and major reporting side if it's a large paper.  If it's a small paper, it doesn't matter.  Call the managing editor and ask him/her to send out a reporter.  
<dd>-- local TV stations.  Many have developed programs such as "In your corner" where they help citizens take on city hall and that type of thing.  Call your TV stations, and send them copies of your documentation.  If there are good visuals, they might send out a camera crew and do a story.


<dd>-- your local police chief and/or supervising officer in your area.  Follow up with a call to the police and ask what they are doing about this situation.
<li>Organize a meeting of your neighbors in one of your homes to discuss legal action. Call your Mayor and city council member(s) and invite him/her to attend the neighborhood meeting, at which you should present the evidence (again) of the situation and ask what they intend to do about it. Put the officials on the spot. Invite the landlords to attend and explain what they plan to do about the situation.  Invite the press.
<li>Is there an attorney in your neighborhood?  Do any of the neighbors have a son or daughter who is an attorney?  That may become a necessity at some point -- although I'm always hesitant to tell people to hire/listen to an attorney.  They're not universally good and sometimes they are too afraid to lead your group in a fight.  But it wouldn't hurt to start assessing potential attorneys that might be available to help out if you need to file legal proceedings.
<li>Organize a group to appear at your city council meeting if the private meetings don't produce any results.
</ol>
<dd>If you try these things and nothing happens, write me back and we'll figure out what to do next.
<p>

Dear Cleta:

I am a College Professor who became active in local Republican 
politics in the late 80s, on the assumption that all political 
should begin locally. Now, I find myself on the Board of Directors 
of a group called United Conservatives of Ohio.  (I live and teach
in the Dayton, Ohio area.)  UCO does little now except to rate state
legislators (Senators and Assemblymen) and publish these ratings,
something like the American Conservative Union, with which we are 
loosely affiliated.  I would like them to do more than this.  What
do you think of the following, and is there anything you would add to
the list:
 
-a "Home Page" on the Web;
-a quarterly newsletter, focusing on state rather than national issues;
-broader solicitation for funds (at present, we are mostly supported by 
lobbyists and a biennial fund-raising dinner).

We already have a PAC, legally separate from UCO, which doles out tiny 
contributions (in the $100 to $500 range) to candidates for the Ohio 
Legislature.

Thank you in advance for any hints you may have.

Board Member, United Conservatives of Ohio

</pre>
<p>
Dear United Conservatives of Ohio:

<dd>Good for you!  Organizing a statewide entity, having a PAC and hosting a biennial dinner are great activities.  A Web site is another good idea.  Maybe your site should be hooked up with Town Hall somehow, the national conservative web site, so other Ohio folks can find you more easily on the web.
<p>
<dd>One suggestion is to have press conferences during this fall election season where you present your endorsement and contribution directly, in person to the state legislative candidates you've endorsed.  Have a prepared statement as to why this good candidate has garnered your endorsement, the issues that he/she has been particularly good on, and a paragraph about your organization and how to contact it. Have photographers and local reporters there -- or go the newspaper itself in the smaller towns and have your press conference at the newspaper offices. 
<p>
<dd>This is a way for your $100 contribution to be turned into several hundred dollars worth of free press, plus, you look a candidate/legislator in the eye and say thank you publicly at a time when it means something to them.  They will be even more committed to your issues thereafter!
<p>
<dd>Good luck!

<title>Clinton's New Budget: And the Winner Is..Big Government - Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center><h3>CLINTON'S NEW BUDGET: AND THE WINNER IS ... BIG GOVERNMENT</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/hodge.htm">Scott Hodge</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
March 21, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The new budget President Clinton released this week was supposed to attack big government. Big government won.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Over seven years, President Clinton's fiscal year 1997 budget proposes $358 billion in higher spending and $232 billion in higher federal tax revenues than the balanced budget submitted to him by Congress last fall, which he vetoed. That amounts to $3,580 in higher spending and $2,320 in higher tax revenue for every household in America. So much for "the end of big government."
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
And what about the deficit candidate Clinton vowed to slay within five years if elected? Compared to the 1995 Balanced Budget Act, the president's new budget adds $125 billion in new red ink through the year 2002.  That amounts to increasing the debt burden on every household by $1,250.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But give the president credit -- for some exceptionally brazen budget gimmickry. On paper, his fiscal year 1997 budget balances by 2002, but only by leaving the real work of deficit reduction to a future president and Congress.  Consider:  The White House budget purports to save nearly $600 billion over seven years, but only 40 percent of those savings would come during Clinton's second term in office, if he wins.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Simply put, it's a lot easier to balance the budget when some other president will bear the brunt of responsibility for deficit reduction. Under the 1997 Clinton budget, the first president and Congress of the next century would have to find 63 percent of the savings -- not just from political lemons like foreign aid, but from favored programs like Medicare and Medicaid.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Not only does the president leave the spending mess for someone else to clean up, he hogs popular tax cuts for himself. Under his budget, middle-class families would get a tax credit for each child, increasing in value from $300 in 1997 to $500 by 1999. But in 2002, the deadline for a balanced budget, Clinton's child tax credit vanishes.  The result in that year: an $18 billion tax increase on families with children. But this doesn't worry the White House either, since some future president will have to deliver the bad news.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	What's more, the president's budget offsets these tax cuts with big tax increases.  All told, the White House budget contains $99.7 billion in tax cuts and $62.4 billion in tax increases.  New taxes exceed the president's proposed seven-year Medicaid savings ($59 billion) and surpass by half his proposed welfare cuts ($40 billion).  In the end, the net tax cut is $37 billion, or just 3 cents of every $1,000 taxpayers will send to Washington over the next seven years. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	And let's not forget: This is the same president who said he would work with Congress to craft some kind of capital-gains tax cut.  But not only does his budget propose no such tax cut, it calls for $4 billion in higher capital-gains taxes over the next seven years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Meanwhile, the president's budget treats entitlement programs such as Medicaid and Medicare -- the real engines behind uncontrolled spending growth -- with kid gloves. In fact, spending on entitlements steams ahead by $370 billion, or 50 percent, over seven years.  For all "mandatory" programs, spending would grow from 49 cents of every federal dollar today to 59 cents of every federal dollar in 2002.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This threatens not only the country's solvency, but the future of entitlement programs themselves.  In less than 15 years, spending on entitlements and debt interest will consume nearly every dollar in the federal budget, according to the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement Reform headed by Sen. Robert Kerry, D-Neb., and retired Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The president's response? His budget proposes to slow the growth of Medicare spending by $124 billion over seven years -- not nearly enough to save the program from collapse.  For Medicaid, the situation is just as bad. If nothing is done to reform the program, runaway costs could force states to raise taxes or cut spending by $146 billion. And the president's proposed "reform" -- placing a cap on how much the federal government will spend per Medicaid beneficiary -- could slap $47 billion in new costs on already cash-strapped states.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There is one area of the budget, however, where the White House does propose real change: spending on presidential "pork" gets a big boost. Clinton's budget outlines a sweeping agenda of new spending initiatives on priorities important to politically influential special-interest groups: education (teachers' unions), high technology (corporations) and the environment ("green" activists). Compared to Congress' balanced budget, the president would shovel an extra $106 billion over seven years to programs supported by such groups.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Let's face it. The president's budget -- while claiming, technically, to eliminate the deficit by 2002 -- is just more obfuscation, smoke and mirrors. It is not the end of big government, it is the embodiment of it.

<title>Guess Who's Getting Your Campaign Contribution? -- Heritage</title>

<h3>GUESS WHO'S GETTING YOUR CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION?</h3>
By Corinne Coldwell<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
January 18, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%>
</center><p>
	You know that voluntary check-off box on your federal income-tax form for contributing 
to presidential campaigns? Who do you think is collecting all that money? President Clinton, 
maybe? Or Sen. Robert Dole, R-Kan., and the other GOP contenders for the nation's highest 
office? 
<p>	As a matter of fact, many legitimate presidential contenders have collected "presidential 
matching funds" this year. But so has a candidate whose platform includes a provision to 
colonize Mars.
<p>	Lyndon H. LaRouche Jr., who was released from prison two years ago after duping his 
supporters out of $34 million for a 1988 presidential bid, is among the many candidates who 
have applied for matching funds to finance his latest campaign.
<p>	LaRouche began his perennial bids for the presidency when public money became 
available 20 years ago. In fact, a Federal Election Commission (FEC) decision to deny LaRouche 
public funds in 1992  -- when he was running his presidential campaign out of prison -- was 
overturned in court last year, granting him $568,534 in taxpayer dollars. 
<P>	With such lavish funding, he is able to promote his paranoid suspicions, for example, that 
former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger has spied for the Russians, and that Queen Elizabeth II 
is involved in the international drug trade. 
<p>	Since 1976 millions of Americans have designated some of their tax dollars to fund 
presidential campaigns, unaware that this setup allows people like LaRouche to tap into the 
public trust fund. The money becomes available to "qualified" candidates through the FEC.  
<p>	But since the FEC is a government body, it is not allowed to make political judgments. 
And since the public funds are not guided by taxpayers' philosophical commitments to particular 
candidates, tax dollars inevitably wind up going to political extremists attracted by government 
subsidies.
<p>	For example, last November LaRouche submitted a request for matching funds to the 
tune of $261,235, outpacing legitimate presidential contenders Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, 
($240,524), Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., ($157,553), Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Penn.,  ($71,039), 
former Tennessee Governor and Education Secretary Lamar Alexander ($205,471) and 
California Governor Pete Wilson, ($71,571), who subsequently dropped out of the race.  
<p>	There's more. Take the case of Lenora Fulani, the New York City psychologist who 
inexplicably calls herself a "major-minor" candidate. Calling for free medicine, free housing, and 
free education, this perennial leftist candidate has never explained how she would pay for these 
services. But she's found a convenient way to pay for her campaigns: the taxpayer. From 1984 to 
1992, she received $3.5 million in taxpayer funds, even though her support never has reached 1 
percent. She is expected to run in 1996 as well.  Given her history, she will be certified to receive 
matching funds once again.
<p>	One would think Congress would be working to change the situation. Yet, a bipartisan 
campaign-finance measure currently making its way through the Senate (with a companion bill 
being drafted in the House) does not deal with public financing.  
<p>	Fewer and fewer Americans are checking the matching-funds box. While 28.7 percent of 
taxpayers designated $1 to campaigns in 1980, only 14.5 percent checked the box in 1993. In 
fact, participation has fallen off so dramatically that Congress increased the check-off to $3. By 
trebling the check-off in 1993, receipts rose by $43.7 million despite participation being halved. 
<p>	The public no longer supports taxpayer-subsidized political campaigns. While public 
financing supporters say it will help tomorrow's Lincoln shoot for the moon, in reality it is 
helping today's LaRouche reach for Mars.

<HTML><title>The Emerging International Mafia -- Heritage Commentary</title>

<h3>THE EMERGING INTERNATIONAL MAFIA</h3>

By <a href="http://www.senate.gov/senator/grassley.html">Sen. Charles Grassley</a><br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
February 23, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>

<p>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Even as America wages a fierce battle against organized 
criminal gangs here at home, the threat to U.S. interests from an emerging international crime cartel 
grows more serious every day. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Groups like the Colombian Cartels, the Asian Triads and the 
Italian Mafias -- long destabilizing factors in their host countries -- are becoming significant players 
on the international stage, carrying out their criminal activities across borders and threatening the 
stability and interests of numerous countries.  In short, they have become an international security 
threat.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Fresh evidence of this growing threat comes from Colombia, 
where President Ernesto Samper is under pressure to resign for allegedly taking massive campaign 
contributions for his 1994 presidential race from the Cali cocaine cartel. Whether these particular 
charges are true or not, groups like the Cali cartel -- which is already responsible for up to 80 
percent of the cocaine that reaches the United States -- are increasingly able to operate above the 
law, buying off or even killing the government officials who are supposed to work with U.S. law-
enforcement agencies to crack down on crime.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What's worse, the cartels, triads and Mafias are now forging 
alliances with criminal organizations in Russia, Mexico and Nigeria, giving these organized crime 
syndicates a truly international reach.  They are becoming an international crime corporation with 
illegal franchises spanning the globe.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The ability of these groups to operate with complete 
disregard for local or international law -- not to mention common decency -- now threatens to 
destabilize a number of countries, especially poor states that are trying to implement economic and 
democratic reforms.  By corrupting government officials and undermining legitimate business 
enterprises, these criminal cabals threaten to set back progress in developing nations by many years, 
and in the case of Russia, could forestall reform indefinitely.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The list of crimes the new international criminal 
organizations are involved in is long.  They traffic in drugs, people, and chemical, biological and 
nuclear material.  They perpetrate billions of dollars worth of fraud against banks, businesses and 
governments.  They destroy lives, undermine economies, diminish confidence in political and 
economic reform, and spread corruption and violence.  In short, they have become an international 
security threat. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What to do?  Clearly, we need to devise a new foreign policy 
to deal with these criminal groups -- to put them out of business and in jail.  In his recent speech to 
the United Nations, President Clinton acknowledged the growing threat posed by international 
criminal groups and called for stronger efforts to fight these organizations.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Such efforts must achieve several goals: dismantle the major 
criminal groups, stiffen the penalties for engaging in international crime, and foster international 
cooperation to counter the actions of criminal elements.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	At home, U.S. policy-makers can take concrete steps to help 
meet these goals.  We must beef up intelligence capabilities against key groups and their leaders.  
We must work with other countries to strengthen their legal systems and police forces.  We must 
enhance our ability to monitor the flow of money to prevent criminal organizations from abusing 
international financial and banking systems.  And we must increase international awareness of the 
threat these groups pose and forge a united front to bring them to justice.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	No country is immune from the debilitating influence of 
international organized crime. The political corruption scandals in Colombia and Italy, the 
challenge to democracy in Russia, the brazen ruthlessness of the Mexican Mafia, and U.S. streets 
awash in drugs -- all are the product of ruthless criminal organizations willing to trample human life 
and dignity in their rush for ill-gotten gain. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As the most powerful country on earth, the United States has 
an obligation to lead the world in crafting a tough, international response. Just as President Bush 
cobbled together a coalition to counter the threat posed by Saddam Hussein, so too must President 
Clinton start to work with any interested nation in challenging the threat posed by the new 
international crime cartels.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Unlike Colombia, the United States has not yet faced a 
political threat from international criminal activity.  But we see the impact of the international 
crime on our streets every day, in the wasted lives and drug violence tearing our cities apart.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Cold War may be over, but America still has enemies in 
the world. Emerging international crime cartels are simply the latest.  The United States cannot 
afford to ignore this problem, but must begin to fashion a foreign-policy response as tough as the 
stand we take against criminal groups here at home.
<p>

<title>The Recovery of American Citizenship -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h3> THE RECOVERY OF AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP </h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/meyerson.htm">Adam Meyerson</a><br>
Editor of <a href="/heritage/p_review">Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</a> <br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
June 20, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	When America's founding fathers talked about "citizenship," they meant people -- not political elites -- taking responsibility for themselves, their families, their communities. This Fourth of July, Americans should think about joining a movement that would restore the founders' vision of how Americans solve their problems.  
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I'm talking about the "citizenship" movement, which aims to rein in Washington so the energy and effectiveness of state and local government and private alternatives to government can be explored to the fullest. One of America's core objectives during the next 20 years should be to recover this tradition of American citizenship. We must restore the link between freedom and personal responsibility, the two great themes of modern conservatism, and an increasingly attractive idea to liberals beginning to see the futility of government solutions. Our hope is that we can overcome much of the divisiveness and incivility that has characterized political discourse over the past several decades.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Americans come from all races, all nationalities, all religions. We are united in citizenship not by common ancestry but by a common commitment to the principles of the United States: the rule of law, the decentralized government promised by our Constitution, the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Americans are united, too, by the common duties of citizenship: the obligation to protect our country from foreign enemies, to take care of our own families, to participate actively in civic life, to assist our neighbors and communities when they are needy, and, in turn, not to take advantage of others' generosity when we can take care of ourselves.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This distinctively American tradition of citizenship was best described by the Frenchman Alexis de Tocqueville in "Democracy in America," his classic book of 1832. Tocqueville described America as the most democratic, most egalitarian, most religious, most prosperous, most charitable country on earth -- with limited national government and active citizen involvement in local government. It was an America of strong families and entrepreneurial business leadership, an America where voluntary associations of citizens were more important -- and more powerful -- than politicians in addressing the problems of their own communities. 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This is not to say Tocqueville's America wasn't marred by some terrible evils -- most notably the scourge of slavery. But there also were many things of which Thomas Jefferson and James Madison could be proud. It was a republic of self-governing citizens, which is what the founding fathers envisioned when they declared independence from England and wrote our Constitution.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To revive the founders' dream, it is essential to reduce the size and scope of the national government. But just as liberals must learn to accept this fact, conservatives must understand that merely tearing down the Washington establishment will not be sufficient. It is also essential to strengthen the families, voluntary associations, churches and other religious organizations, local governments and other institutions of civil society that will remedy the ills left untreated by failed federal-government programs.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Revivals of private initiative have happened before. The second half of the 19th  and the early 20th century saw the creation of the Red Cross, the Boy Scouts, YMCAs and YWCAs, and countless other voluntary organizations that strengthened character and addressed the failings of their communities. A similar wave of social entrepreneurship will sweep America in the next generation. 	
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The recovery of American citizenship is the most important unifying principle for Americans in the post-Cold War era. It appeals to libertarians with their emphasis on a free society of voluntary, non-governmental institutions. It appeals to those with religious values who emphasize faith and family and responsibility for the needy. It appeals to growth-and-opportunity conservatives who emphasize economic freedom. With its attention to the common obligations of citizenship, this idea appeals to nationalists who want to restore a strong sense of American cultural identity. And it appeals to liberals and their love for community activism.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
"Without local institutions," wrote Tocqueville 160 years ago, "a nation may give itself a free government, but it does not have the spirit of liberty." It is time for all Americans to help rebuild the local institutions that will bring back our spirit of liberty.<p>

<title>Gary Bauer's June, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

June 7, 1996

<p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

June is fittingly called &quot;the month of weddings.&quot; 
As the first real warm days of summer finally arrive, skies are
blue, flowers are blooming, and brides and grooms are seemingly
everywhere.  Marriage is never out of season, but I can think
of no better time than the month of June for our nation to reaffirm
the value and meaning of marriage.

<p>

As this letter is written, a reaffirmation of marriage is taking
place all across our land.  You can hear it in the peal of church
bells and read about it in wedding announcements and church bulletins.
You can even see it in brightly decorated cars parading by on
dazzling June days.  But this reaffirmation is taking place in
another way, too.

<p>

In Washington, DC, and in over 30 states, legislators are stepping
forward to make sure that marriage is protected in American law.
My letter is brief this month because the Family Research Council
is in the thick of this essential effort.  The reaffirmation of
traditional marriage is coming <b>just in time</b>.  Even as I
write this, an organized assault is in progress to redefine marriage
to allow men to marry men and women to marry women.

<p>

Let me recap quickly what has happened.  In 1993, the highest
court in Hawaii handed down a shocking decision.  Liberal judges
there said that Hawaii's law limiting marriage to one man and
one woman (similar to laws in every other state) was a form of
sex discrimination -- unless the state could somehow show that it
had a &quot;compelling interest&quot; in reserving marriage to
couples of the opposite sex!  Hawaii is a very liberal state politically,
but this ruling sparked immediate outrage even there.

<p>

Nearly three quarters of Hawaii's citizens told pollsters they
<I>reject</I> making Hawaii a haven for homosexual couples to
&quot;marry.&quot;  In 1994 the Hawaii legislature responded and
passed a law reaffirming that marriage is intended for &quot;man-woman
units&quot; -- not two men or two women.

<p>

Despite the findings of this poll, and subsequent efforts to
convince the courts that Hawaii does have a &quot;compelling interest&quot;
here, most experts believe that traditional marriage in Hawaii
will be struck down -- perhaps as soon as this August.  If that happens,
homosexual couples from every state in the Union are ready to
fly to Hawaii and find &quot;chapels&quot;or Justices of the Peace
to marry them.  They will then return to their home states and
demand recognition of these marriages from their state and local
governments, from their employers, from the courts, from their
churches (and from you)!

<p>

The worst news is that these demands have a good chance of succeeding.
Under what is known as the &quot;Full Faith and Credit&quot;
clause of the U.S. Constitution, each state is required to recognize
the &quot;Public Acts, Records and Judicial Proceedings&quot;
of every other state (Article IV, Section 1).   States that refuse
to recognize these Hawaiian &quot;marriage&quot; licenses as valid
are likely to find themselves being sued in court, with the outcome
uncertain.  Unbelievably, the action of a single court -- or even
a single judge -- in Hawaii could lead to a revolution that undoes
the sanctity of the marriage bond in every corner of the United
States.

<p>

<b>We must not -- and cannot -- allow this to happen!</b> When Hawaii's
Supreme Court ruled in 1993, FRC responded with alerts and issue
papers pointing out the devastating impact that would follow.
We and other groups encouraged states to respond by reaffirming
the traditional definition of marriage to insulate it from attack.
The word has spread rapidly, and a wide coalition of religious
and family groups and legislators of all political persuasions
is currently pushing for marriage protection laws.

<p>

Such laws have now been enacted in at least eleven states, and
more may be signed into law by the time you read this.  In addition,
the Congress of the United States is set to respond to this challenge.
With FRC's help and through the dedicated efforts of legal experts
on Capitol Hill, legislation has been introduced to protect marriage
in federal law.  This legislation is called the Defense of Marriage
Act, or DOMA.  It was introduced in the House of Representatives
on May 7 by Reps. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) and Bob  Barr (R-Ga.).
Senate introduction of the legislation followed on May 8 with
Don Nickles (R-Okla.) and Bob Dole (R-Kans.) as co-sponsors.
The respective bill numbers are H.R.3396 and S.1740.

<p>

Make no mistake, this bill is vitally needed.  Sen. Dan Coats
(R-Ind.) issued a powerful statement endorsing the bill and explaining
the importance of marriage.  His quote is worth sharing at length:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Marriage is the institution that civilizes our society by 
humanizing our lives. It is the social, legal and spiritual 
relationship that prepares the next generation for its duties and 
opportunities.  An 1884 decision of the Supreme Court called it 
&quot;the sure foundation of all that is stable and noble
in our civilization.&quot;

<p>

The definition of marriage is not created by politicians and judges, 
and it cannot be changed by them.  It is rooted in our history,
in our laws, our deepest moral and religious convictions, and our 
nature as human beings.  It is the union of one man and one woman. 
This fact can be respected or resented, but it can't be altered.

<p>

The institution of marriage is our most valuable cultural inheritance. 
It is our duty -- perhaps our first duty -- to pass it intact to the 
future . . . It is amazing and disturbing that the debate should even 
be necessary.  It is a sign of the times, and an indication of a deep 
moral confusion.  But events have made the definition of traditional 
marriage essential.  The preservation of marriage has become an issue 
of self-preservation for our society.</i>

</blockquote><p>

With Senator Coats' words, the case for marriage rests.
Be assured that the Family Research Council will continue to
work with him and other like-minded legislators in both parties
to secure passage of this bill as soon as possible -- before a final
decision is reached by the Supreme Court in Hawaii.  Americans
need to be heard before our courts intervene and disturb yet another
legal ideal.  Our goal is that DOMA will swiftly reach President
Clinton's desk and that he will have no choice but to sign it
into law.

<p>

<b>The need for passage of this bill could not be more urgent.
On May 20, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the state of Colorado's
Amendment 2, which would have blocked special rights for homosexuals.
One leader of the homosexual movement bragged, &quot;This is
a joyous day for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Americans.&quot;</b>

<title>Gary Bauer's May, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

May 15, 1996

<p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

You probably read about the incredible speech Supreme Court Justice 
Antonin Scalia delivered at a prayer breakfast in early April at 
the Mississippi College School of Law in Jackson. Scalia delivered 
a stirring defense of the role of Christians in public life. The 
reaction was a prolonged standing ovation. But there was no ovation 
for the speech inside the Washington Beltway, where FRC fights 
every day on behalf of your family, or among America's cultural 
elite.

<p>

&quot;Justice Scalia: Defender of the Faith,&quot; sneered the
headline in the <I>International Herald Tribune.</I>[1]

<p>

The speech &quot;clearly undermines public confidence in [Scalia's]
objectivity regarding religious controversies,&quot;[2] said Barry
Lynn of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State.

<p>

&quot;This is a disturbing view for a Justice to have,&quot;[3] said
Elliott Mincberg, legal director of Norman Lear's group, People for
the American Way.

<p>

The speech should have set off &quot;alarm bells,&quot;[4] charged
political columnists Jack Germond and Jules Witcover.

<p>

In a few pockets of liberalism outside the beltway the reaction
was even harsher:

<p>

Humor columnist Art Buchwald fired away: &quot;When a Justice
is hearing a case, no secular person can feel comfortable with
a member of the court who is thinking, 'If this lawyer doesn't
believe in the &quot;burning bush,&quot; he has a serious constitutional
problem.'&quot;[5]

<p>

<I>Des Moines Register</I> writer Donald Kaul, suggested that
Scalia &quot;occupies the outermost reaches of the right of the
court (some days you can only reach him by dogsled).&quot;[6]

<p>

What words could have possibly sparked such -- there's no other word
but <I>scornful</I> -- reactions from so many elements of the working
press? Scalia spoke to the crowd of 650 fellow Americans about the 
difficulty of upholding Christian beliefs, especially a belief in miracles,
in our increasingly secular society. He pointed out that the word
&quot;cretin,&quot; or &quot;fool,&quot; is derived from the French
word for &quot;Christian,&quot; and added:

<p><blockquote>

<i>To be honest about it, that is the view of Christians taken
by modern society. Surely those who adhere to all or most of these 
traditional Christian beliefs are to be regarded as simple-minded.</i>[7]

<p>

The &quot;worldly wise,&quot; he went on:

<p>

<i>just will not have anything to do with miracles . . . [they
assume] that everything from Easter morning to the Ascension had to 
be made up by the groveling enthusiasts</i> (the disciples - ed.) 
<i>as part of their plan to get themselves martyred.</i>[8]

</blockquote><p>

In the midst of this cynicism, he concluded, &quot;We must pray
to endure the scorn of the sophisticated world.&quot;[9] Justice 
Scalia's prayers came not a moment too soon. Those
who immediately attacked the speech, calling it contrary
to American tradition and inconsistent with his role as a judge,
seemed blissfully unaware that they were only confirming the truth
of what he said.

<p>

One professor of constitutional law at American University in
Washington, D.C., blasted the speech and remarked, &quot;We expect
our Supreme Court justices to be the most secular of our public
servants.&quot;[10] <b><i>We</i></b>? Where in our
Declaration of Independence and Constitution is it written that
judges must be less endowed with a sense of religious conviction
than other officials? The professor could only have been speaking
for that group of Americans who agree with <I>his</I> own expectation.
Most Americans <i>still</i> believe that every citizen, regardless
of their religious belief, is equal before the law. It is that
very equality -- the right of Christians to bring their full convictions
into the public square -- that Justice Scalia, and we at FRC, believe is 
under attack.

<p>

Don't let me leave the impression here that Scalia was without
defenders. Among them was syndicated newspaper columnist Cal Thomas,
who eloquently reminded readers that it was a rather
well-known &quot;public servant,&quot; Abraham Lincoln, who said,
&quot;But for this Book [the Bible], we would not know right from
wrong.&quot;[11]

<p>

Is there a difference between Presidents and Supreme Court Justices
in this regard? Our history and tradition say otherwise. The
Supreme Court begins each day of oral argument with the bailiff
stating, &quot;God save this honorable court.&quot; As you enter
the Supreme Court building, there is, on the right side of
the portico, a statue of Moses holding aloft the tablet of the
Ten Commandments.

<p>

The critics say, &quot;Those are mere symbols, devoid of meaning.&quot;
They believe that Scalia crossed a line that Justices must never 
cross -- expressing his religious faith. But once again, they 
don't know our history! Justices of our Supreme Court have time 
and again pronounced themselves about religious faith in general 
and Christianity in particular.

<p>

John Jay, the first Chief Justice, said in 1777:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Providence has given to our people the choice of their rulers,
and it is the duty, as well as the privilege and the interest, of a 
Christian nation to select and prefer Christians for their rulers.</i>[12]

</blockquote><p>

Imagine any public official saying something similar today! No
Christian leader or politician would echo Jay's observation today,
but the point is, such beliefs were not extraordinary among the
men and women who founded this nation. Daniel Webster is esteemed
as one of the five greatest senators in U.S. history, by resolution
of the Senate.[13] At the bicentennial of the Pilgrims' landing at
Plymouth Rock in 1620, Webster's keynote address included these
words:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Our ancestors established their system of government on morality
and religious sentiment. Moral habits, they believed, cannot safely be 
trusted on any other foundation than religious principle, nor any 
government be secure which is not supported by moral habits. Whatever 
makes men Christians, makes them good citizens.</i>[14]

</blockquote><p>

In July 1835, when Chief Justice John Marshall died, the Liberty
Bell was rung, sustaining the crack that is one of the keys to
its fame.[15] Are American traditions affronted by the fact that the
Liberty Bell, one of a handful of supposedly secular American
&quot;shrines,&quot; bears the words of Leviticus 25:10: &quot;Proclaim
liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof&quot;?
In 1852, Justice John McLean wrote a letter asserting that &quot;Aside
from Revelation, darkness rests upon the world and upon the future.
The Bible has shed a glorious light upon the world.&quot;[16]

<p>

To all of these examples, dozens more could be added, from
Lincoln to McKinley to Coolidge, to TR and FDR, to John F. Kennedy,
to Jimmy Carter, to Ronald Reagan. Candid assertions of the importance
of religious beliefs to democratic institutions transcend partisan
divisions. It was Justice William O. Douglas, perhaps the Supreme
Court's leading liberal for nearly four decades, who wrote
that, &quot;We are a religious people whose institutions
presuppose a Supreme Being.&quot;[17]

<p>

In short, what Justice Scalia said is in keeping with
a long line of statements by American jurists and statesmen. But
what about the substance of what he said? Do Christians face any
special level of scorn in modern society? Sadly, I believe they
do. Among the Beltway publications, the liberal <I>Washington Post</I>
published the most hostile appraisal of Scalia's speech. Of course, 
just a few years ago, they printed a front-page story suggesting 
that Christian voters are &quot;poor, uneducated and easily led.&quot;

<p>

Just a few weeks ago, the <I>Los Angeles Times</I> printed a cartoon
showing a crucified Bob Dole. A crown of thorns was depicted lacing
his head, with the crown composed of letters spelling out, &quot;Christian
Coalition.&quot;[18] That same paper, on Easter Sunday, refused to
print the regular Johnny Hart comic strip called &quot;B.C.&quot;
because it referred positively to the Resurrection of Christ.
&quot;B.C.&quot; was out, and PC, political correctness, was in!

<p>

Perhaps the real scourges in our society today are reserved for
sincere religious believers <I>of any kind</I>. Consider what
happened to Marian P. MacDonald and Teen Challenge. Marian spent
32 years building an outstanding record as a public school teacher
in Greensboro, North Carolina. She was forced to resign her post
last month under pressure from the school system. The reason?
She invited members of Teen Challenge to one of her health and
physical education classes. Teen Challenge is an extremely effective
drug rehabilitation organization that incorporates religious principles
in its program.

<p>

The visiting teens told MacDonald's class they believed God had
helped them overcome drug abuse, but added, &quot;We are not here
to push our religion off on anybody.&quot; Apparently, that disclaimer
was not enough. The school principal sent a note home to parents
apologizing for the teens' &quot;insensitive comments.&quot; An
investigation followed, and MacDonald was essentially fired.[19] 
Stories like this are all too common.

<p>

I believe that Justice Scalia, whose sense of fairness and level
of scholarship are without match in the federal judiciary, has paid
religion the high compliment of taking it seriously. As I reported
to you last month, Christian convictions <I>are</I> cause for
persecution in many lands around the globe. Bigotry against
Christians in American, by comparison, seems mild; but that bigotry
is real nonetheless. Moreover, the aggressive, secularizing forces
in our nation today are committed to keeping you and me out of 
government, law, and the public debate on all the great issues.

<p>

True religious tolerance <i>is</i> the American way. But Justice
Scalia's critics would have you believe that the sanctity of human
life, traditional marriage, equal access of religious speakers
to the public square, and dozens of other ideas are merely a religious
creed and not the common code of civilization. In a healthy society,
Scalia's articulation of his private thoughts in the setting of
a private prayer breakfast would not have been news. That
they are news at all tells us a great deal about the crisis facing
America today.

<p>

I can assure you that, with your help, the Family Research Council
will continue to speak calmly, but passionately, in behalf of
moral values and true religious liberty. We hold with Daniel Webster
that good Christianity and good citizenship go hand in hand. And
we invite all Americans of goodwill to join with us in honoring
and preserving the values of family, faith and freedom.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S. We'd love to hear from you this month. Many of you are already
aware of the &quot;Compact with Our Fellow Americans&quot; included
in my book <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams.</I> The Compact is designed
to renew the spirit of cooperation among our citizens. Its final
provision states, &quot;In our personal lives, we promise to honor
the Creator, who made us and endowed us with such unalienable
rights as life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We will
practice our faith on a daily basis and will gather with others
to worship regularly. Without resorting to coercion or vilification,
we will encourage faith, and the fruits of faith, in others.&quot;

<p>

Just check the enclosed reply card if you would like a free copy
of the Compact, suitable for framing. Thank you for your support
of our efforts on behalf of America's families and for reading
my letter this month. God bless you.

<title>The March For Big Government -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>

<h3>
THE MARCH FOR BIG GOVERNMENT</h3>
By Kenneth Weinstein<br>
Director of the Government Reform Project<br>
 <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
May 23, 1996<br>
<hr width="50%"></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	On June 1, 1996, national attention will focus on the "Stand for Children" march on the Mall in Washington, D.C.  The theme of this march, ostensibly, is something that all Americans can support: "a day ... to celebrate children and those who struggle every day to raise them." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Organizers of the "Stand for Children" claim between 200,000 and 1 million people will gather at the Lincoln Memorial "in a non-partisan call to action."  Unfortunately, the principal "action" likely to be called for is an increase in federal spending. The reason: More than 100 of the sponsoring organizations are direct federal grant recipients receiving more than $392 million annually. The actual figure is assuredly higher, since that total excludes grants to many affiliate organization as well as all funds received from state or local governments. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	A slick public relations campaign has generated dozens of news stories hailing the Stand's call "to affirm our responsibility as families, individuals, communities, and as a national community for improving the quality of life of children."  But an examination of organizations endorsing the event makes it clear that the Stand for Children is not a non-partisan, pro-children march. It is a stand for government dependency and ought to be dubbed "The March For Big Government."  Consider:
<ul>
	<li>The event is being convened by the Children's Defense Fund (CDF) -- an organization once chaired by Hillary Rodham Clinton. The president of the CDF, Marian Wright Edelman, is a chief opponent of  the 104th Congress' efforts to reform welfare.  In 1973, Edelman admitted that because she no longer could stir up interest in government programs by speaking of "poor people," she would emphasize children.  "Children," after all, "might be a very effective way to broaden the base of change."
<p>	<li>Lobbyists appear to be a major constituency of the Stand for Children. Lobbying groups that push for greater spending on federal programs already costing more than $7 billion annually have endorsed the march. Among these are the National and Community Service Coalition (chief lobbyist for President Clinton's $400 million national service boondoggle, AmeriCorps), the National Head Start Center (lobbyist for the $2.2 billion Head Start program), and the National Association of WIC Directors (The Special Supplement Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children, a $3.6 billion federal program in fiscal year 1995). Families USA, a key lobbying organization for Bill Clinton's failed big-government health-care plan, is also a march endorser.
<p>	<li>At least 20 national organizations representing government employees, such as the U.S. Conference of City Human Services Officials and the National Association of School Psychologists, also will be participating in the march.
<p>	<li>The AFL-CIO, which is spending $35 million in mandatory union dues to defeat conservative members of Congress this year, is actively promoting the march. Thirty-three of its affiliated unions are serving as national endorsing organizations for the Stand for Children. At this past February's meeting of the AFL-CIO Executive Committee, when union leaders decided to launch their efforts to "take back the Congress" (take it back for whom?), two guests were invited to speak: one was Marian Wright Edelman, who spoke about the Stand for Children rally. Obviously, she got what she was after.
<p>	<li>At least 50 liberal organizations with no special focus on children, including the Americans for Democratic Action, the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund, Greenpeace, the National Rainbow Coalition, and Zero Population Growth, are co-sponsors of the march.
 <p>	<li>As if to remove all doubt about the government-oriented nature of this event, one federal agency has even gotten into the act directly.  The Agriculture Department's $932 million Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service has signed on as a national endorser of the Stand For Children under the guise of its outreach program, Families 4H and Nutrition. Also, the Freddie Mac Foundation, an arm of the federally chartered Freddie Mac Corp., has signed on to the march.
</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	In short, the Stand For Children is yet another a venue for groups that live off the taxpayer to lobby for more money. It is common practice for such organizations to use sympathetic symbols -- yes, even children -- as a "cloaking device" for efforts to expand big government and the welfare state. The fact that few Americans can believe anyone would be so cynical only makes the "cloaking" that much easier. In this case, they want to present their rally as a spontaneous, non-partisan, grassroots expression of altruism towards America's youth. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth.
<p>

<CENTER><FONT FACE="Times New Roman">By John Walters<BR>

<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
February 22, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></CENTER>
<P>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> The budget debate between President
Clinton and Congress is about a lot more than the current level
of federal spending and whether or not taxes should be raised.
It's about who should be responsible for addressing America's
social problems. For example, who should take care of America's
drug problems?</FONT>
<P>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> President Clinton wants Washington
-- Congress, federal bureaucrats, federal judges -- in charge.
The congressional leadership argues that big government has failed
to address America's human needs. They want to return responsibility
to where it has historically rested -- with families, neighborhoods,
communities, churches and synagogues, and state and local governments.
</FONT>
<P>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> The president's position was illustrated
when he threw down the gauntlet in his State of the Union address:
&quot;I challenge Congress not to cut out support for drug-free
schools.&quot; Clinton was referring to June 1995, when he vetoed
legislation to limit the Department of Education's &quot;Drug-Free
Schools and Communities&quot; program. With teenage drug use rising
rapidly since 1992, the president has calculated that Congress
can't successfully oppose anti-drug programs for America's youth.
But this completely ignores the question of who is responsible
for taking action.
<p>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;  Because the congressional leadership believes
the federal government should let communities tackle their own
problems, it voted last year to cut the $465-million budget for
Clinton's anti-drug program by 60 percent. With cameras rolling,
Clinton vetoed the bill in the Rose Garden and called Republicans
&quot;extremists&quot; opposed to drug education. In other words,
as far as the president is concerned, Congress' opposition to
federal anti-drug programs equals opposition to doing anything
about the teen drug problem. </FONT>
<P>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> Of course, no one doubts the importance
of reducing illegal drug use. And the federal government has important
responsibilities, including bringing international drug traffickers
to justice, stopping interstate commerce in illegal substances,
and cracking down on money-laundering schemes. </FONT>
<P>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> But teaching children that drug
use is wrong and harmful is primarily the responsibility of parents
and local communities -- youth organizations, religious institutions,
schools and police. Federal funding is neither necessary nor sufficient
for conveying this very personal message to children on a consistent
basis.</FONT>
<P>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman"> Moreover, the program in question
provides just $7.25 per pupil each year. By the time this money
makes its way through the various state and local bureaucracies,
many schools receive less than $3 per student. The president suggests
that all those parents and teachers who seek to dissuade young
people from using illegal drugs will cease to do so without a
federal subsidy of $3 a child.
<p>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The Drug-Free Schools program began
in 1987 during the Reagan administration's expansion of the war
on drugs. Our nation's leaders were particularly anxious to contain
the explosion in crack addiction. Later, it became clear that
crack use had peaked in 1985 and then declined rapidly -- proving
that efforts on the part of parents and communities were working
long before any federal program tried to help them.
<p>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Yet, the federal
government increased funding for Drug-Free Schools from $200 million
in 1987 to more than $624 million in 1992, paying little attention
to what was happening to the money. Meanwhile, according to former
Michigan drug czar Robert Peterson, &quot;The health-education
lobby misled educators into believing that drugs only pose another
personal health choice. In doing so, federal drug funds underwrote
controversial sex-education expansion and condom giveaways and
enriched health-education consultants.&quot;
<p>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;  Before Michigan
Gov. John Engler stopped it, $32 million in anti-drug funds was
diverted to the Michigan Model for Comprehensive School Health.
More than $81,000 was used to purchase giant plastic teeth and
toothbrushes. Kids who brush, said the &quot;experts,&quot; do
not use drugs. Another $1.5 million was spent on models of the
human torso used just one time. In Washington, D.C., a school
used federal anti-drug money to take its basketball team to a
restaurant. And according to congressional testimony, 400 students
at Dallas' Sunset High School received &quot;A&quot;s for a federally
funded course about substance abuse that never met and had no
teacher.
<p>


&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; However well-intentioned, the nationalization of efforts
to solve problems that should be dealt with on the local level
undermines local and national responsibility and accountability.
By claiming that effective anti-drug education can only come through
federal programs, President Clinton has done America's youth a
disservice.</FONT>

HOW TO AVOID THE NEXT BUDGET CRISIS</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/mason.htm">David Mason</a><br>
Vice President for Government Relations<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
May 23, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	For months now, Congress has been in retreat after being blamed for two partial government shutdowns, the result of its battle with President Clinton over the fiscal 1996 federal budget. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Lawmakers are now scurrying to accommodate the president's spending priorities to avoid an election-year bruising over the 1997 budget, even as they try to preserve enough of their own agenda to save face. But no matter how hard they try, they are going to find themselves in yet another battle royal.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Why?  Is America doomed to suffer government shutdowns year after year, depending only on how vociferously Congress and the White House disagree on budget priorities, tax and spending policy?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Not at all. As it turns out, there is a perfectly good reason why Congress and the president seem perpetually at loggerheads over the budget: Because the law is written in a way that makes this inevitable.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Under the 1974 Budget Act, a Watergate-era attempt by Congress to limit the power of the executive branch, the president is excluded from the budget process until it's almost over -- a recipe for the kind of 11th-hour budget showdowns that grabbed the headlines for so many months.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Here's how it works. Each January the president sends a budget to Capitol Hill, which Congress promptly ignores. In the spring, Congress adopts its own budget resolution based on its own priorities. During the summer, Congress crafts the 13 detailed spending bills needed to meet the budget targets outlined in the resolution, as well as a reconciliation bill making changes in tax and entitlement policy. Finally, in the fall, usually just before the Oct. 1 start of the new fiscal year, Congress sends the budget bills to the president, who now has only one way to try to restore his spending priorities: veto the bills and force an end-of-the-year budget fight. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The result: With insufficient time to negotiate the details, the government shuts down over a dispute about whether or not Medicare premiums should rise by $6 a month.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	To make matters worse, the Budget Act also forces spending to go up even if Congress doesn't want it to. When members of Congress sit down to figure out how much to spend on a program in the coming fiscal year, the Budget Act mandates that they take last year's spending level and automatically add in the cost of population growth, anticipated inflation and other factors. This becomes the new "baseline" for spending, which means that even if Congress does not vote to increase the budget for a program, spending increases will happen anyway.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Any member of Congress who proposes to increase spending on a program by less than the baseline projection is accused of "cutting" the program. That's how Congress' plan to boost spending on Medicare by $100 billion over seven years became a "cut."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A reform plan proposed by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., would fix the problems created by the Budget Act of 1974. For starters, the budget resolution adopted by Congress in the spring would be a legally binding law, signed by the president, and would set a limit on how much the government can spend in the coming fiscal year. In addition, the resolution would have to pass by an early date, April 15, in Cox's plan.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As a result, Congress and the president would know more than five months before the start of the new fiscal year exactly how much money they have to work with.  This would give the two sides a strong incentive to get the big, controversial budget issues (like tax cuts and entitlement reform) out of the way first, greatly lessening the chance of a last-minute deadlock forcing a government shutdown.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Cox plan also would purge the budget process of the pro-spending bias created by "baseline budgeting." Year-to-year spending totals would be compared in real dollars, not in the inflated dollars of the baseline. No longer would advocates of higher spending be able to call a spending increase a "cut." Spending hikes would be out in the open, rather than buried in the dark recesses of the budget process.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The United States has experienced numerous budget crises over the past decade -- in 1986, 1988, 1990, and again in 1995-96. Add to this the bias toward higher spending written into the Budget Act and it's clear the time has come for reform.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Why wait for the next budget crisis to expose (yet again) the flaws in the current system? If Congress wants to end the saga of government shutdowns and impose some real spending control, it should fix the system now.
<p>

<title>Gary Bauer's July, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

July 12, 1996

<p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

The Bauer family had a close call last month.  An unusually strong
summer thunderstorm ripped through the Washington area, bringing
with it 150-mile-per-hour winds.  To make matters worse, a tornado
touched down on our street, knocking down trees and sending limbs
flying through walls and onto rooftops.  Fortunately, our house
was largely spared, but a neighbor's home was badly damaged.

<p>

My daughter, Elyse, and I were driving home through the storm
when the tornado hit.  I'll never forget the sight as we turned
down our street and saw how the severe weather had rearranged
the familiar objects of our daily lives.  The storm was gone in
a little more than an hour, but it was incredible how quickly
so much raw destruction was wreaked on our community.  Human beings
are no match for the forces of God's Creation.  We were struck
with a sense of awe -- and our hearts were filled with thanks that
the destruction was not worse and that no one was injured or killed.

<p>

That twister wasn't the only storm I encountered last month.
Throughout the month of June, I found myself caught up in a whirlwind
over the Republican Party Platform and the sanctity of human life.
Debate over the GOP's pro-life plank has been going on for years,
but this new storm kicked up suddenly and unexpectedly.  It came
about when Sen. Robert Dole, the certain GOP presidential nominee,
called for the addition of  a &quot;declaration of tolerance&quot;
to the platform, and suggested that it be applied <I>only</I>
to the abortion language.  That current language in the existing
platform says that the unborn child has a fundamental right to
life that cannot be infringed, and calls for a human life amendment
to the Constitution.

<p>

Let me say right up front that Sen. Bob Dole and I have known
each other for years.  I consulted with him last fall, at his
request, before he delivered his speech in Hollywood calling on
the entertainment industry to reverse its tide of sex-and-violence
for profit.  We have collaborated over the years on many other
issues.  A few weeks ago, Jim Dobson and I prayed together with
Bob in his Capitol Hill office.  I consider him a friend, and
I believe he would say the same about me.

<p>

But, in my humble opinion, Bob Dole is wrong about the pro-life
plank. It cannot and should not be changed.  Talk about revising
the plank has been swirling, of course, for months in GOP circles.
Some prominent pro-abortion Republicans, like Govs. Christine
Todd Whitman and Pete Wilson, have insisted on removing it altogether.
To do so would repeat the discussion that took place in the Democratic
party some years ago. The 1992 Democratic Platform endorsed an
abortion on demand philosophy.  A previous statement tolerating
the presence of pro-life Democrats in the party was stripped from
the platform.  As a result, President Clinton has vetoed every
attempt to restrict abortion, including those in the 7th, 8th
and 9th months of pregnancy.

<p>

All during the early summer, I was among a number of pro-life
leaders who were kept abreast of negotiations taking place among
leading Republicans.  After weeks of discussion, an agreement
was reached to include &quot;open door&quot; language in the preamble
to the platform.  That language would only state the obvious:
that the GOP platform stands for a set of principles, and that
not every member of the party agrees with every one of those principles.
The sanctity of human life would not be singled out or in any
other way watered down.  The current pro-life plank, powerful
and unequivocal, would remain as written. No deletions.  No dilutions.

<p>

This solution was acceptable, but within 24 hours Bob Dole himself
overturned it. He used a television interview to declare his
intention to put the tolerance language right in the pro-life
plank. Talk about a twister out of the blue!  This so-called
solution was totally unacceptable, and I said so publicly.  The
sanctity-of-life plank is among a handful of essential statements
in the GOP platform.  To attach &quot;tolerance&quot; language
directly to that plank would signal to the world (and the media
immediately interpreted it this way) that the Republican Party
regards it as one of the least important issues facing the nation,
when in fact the issue goes to the heart of the fundamental purpose
of liberty.

<p>

Just consider the impact of including tolerance language on another
subject, say, taxes:  &quot;We favor tax relief for overworked
Americans, but we recognize that many people disagree with us.&quot;
You would instantly recognize that the party which said this
wasn't serious about cutting taxes.  The same holds true for the
profound question of whether unborn children and their mothers
should be protected from the exploitation of abortions.

<p>

What followed my public criticism of Sen. Dole's proposal was
uncomfortable for both of us.  The senator took me on by name,
and major newspapers were happy to splash the dispute across page
one.  I kept my comments focused on the issues at stake, but it
was an awkward moment for me anyway.  Disputes among friends will
always draw a crowd of spectators.  But this fight, gut-wrenching
as it was, has an upside.  First, I have high hopes that, by the
time you read this, the dispute over the pro-life plank will be
resolved with an agreement that makes it clear that our children
deserve the full protection of the laws of the United States.
Second, this public argument gave me a rare chance to address
the nation on why the sanctity of human life matters so much.

<p>

National Public Radio, as liberal a media outlet as there is,
interviewed me in drive-time, and my comments were carried fairly
and without censorship.  <I>The New York Times</I>, <I>Washington
Post</I> and other major papers accurately reported my defense
of our children.  The following weekend, I was invited to appear
on the prestigious CNN public policy show, <I>The Capital Gang.</I>
I was able to tell large segments of the American people what
our nation's abandonment of the sanctity of human life is doing
to the fabric of our society.  All of this came on the heels of
unprecedented media opportunities for the Family Research Council
(FRC), including appearances on <I>This Week with David Brinkley</I> 
and <I>Face the Nation</I> and a write-up in <I>Time</I> magazine
featuring our principled stands.

<p>

Since all of this happened, I have heard from many people who
say they don't necessarily agree with FRC on every issue, but
that we give them something to think about.  This is vital to
remember.  Where &quot;tolerance&quot; language goes in the Republican
platform -- whether it's there at all -- isn't just a matter of dotting
&quot;i's&quot; and crossing &quot;t's.&quot;  If an issue isn't
important enough to appear in any party's platform, then it's
not worth a national conversation.  How we address the sanctity
of human life will determine whether this nation endures, or whether
it is torn away forever from the ideals that motivated our Founders.

<p>

Let me take a moment here to thank you.  In the middle of this
hot debate, hundreds of you called, wrote and faxed me your support.
Countless friends prayed for my family and for FRC.  Believe
me, we felt that encouragement.

<p>

My relationship with Washington leaders in both parties, including
Bob Dole, matters very much to me.  But the Family Research Council
is committed to speaking the truth:  on the needs of families,
on neglected children, on coarseness in the culture, on the virtue
deficit, and on the violence corroding our common sense of neighborliness.
We will speak the truth in election years and non-election years.
We will speak up when it pleases our friends, and when it doesn't.
To do otherwise would be to convert this organization into just
one more nest of political hired guns in the nation's capital.
I won't have that.  The issues facing America are bigger and
more enduring than one presidential race.

<p>

You will be happy to know, for example, that we are working with
a courageous band of Democrats in Congress who are struggling
to add &quot;tolerance&quot; language to the 1996 Democratic Platform.
This is &quot;tolerance&quot; language we <b><i>can</i></b> support
because it moves in the opposite direction:  it would say that
there is room in the Democratic party for people who champion
the &quot;little guy&quot; in the womb.  Unfortunately, I am not
optimistic about a change in their platform even though 40 percent
of registered Democrats hold pro-life beliefs.  For nearly a decade
now, the party has turned a deaf ear to their pleas.  Instead,
they have allowed radical feminists, the ACLU and gay rights groups
to turn the party into a vehicle for radical social change.

<p>

As I've emphasized many times before, FRC does not endorse candidates,
but we do work diligently to keep the issues affecting America's
families at center stage.  Toward that end, we will work with
anyone, anywhere, who is genuinely willing to espouse family-friendly
public policy.

<p>

While I'm writing to you, let me give you an update on another
&quot;contest&quot; in which I've been involved.  This is the
competition I proposed last January between two visions:  the
big-government philosophy of Hillary Rodham Clinton's book, <I>It
Takes a Village</I>, and the family-centered ideals of my book,
<I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams.</I> This spring, Family Research Council
placed advertisements in newspapers and magazines challenging
the American people to compare the visions in these two books
and to choose the one that best represents their hopes for the
next generation of American children.

<p>

So here are the results to date.  The first lady's publisher
reports that 360,000 copies of <I>It Takes a Village</I> are in
print.  Those figures do not necessarily reflect actual sales.
A similar number of copies of <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> have
now been sold, enough to put this little paperback on the Top
Five list of Christian best-sellers for the past three months.
In short, my competition with Mrs. Clinton is neck-and-neck.

<p>

I realize that this has happened only because thousands of faithful
supporters like you have bought multiple copies of <I>Our Hopes,
Our Dreams</I> and shared them with neighbors, friends, and fellow
believers.  I can hardly ask you to do more.  But consider this:
<I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> was written as a straightforward,
easily understood summary of what has drawn pro-family Americans
into the public policy arena in record numbers.  Can you think
of anyone -- an acquaintance or business associate -- who would benefit
from the couple of hours it takes to read this statement of pro-family
principle?

<p>

If you can, it's easy to use our &quot;800&quot; number to order
<I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> directly from us.  Better still,
however, you can take a step that will aid a vital voice in your
community and help boost the ranking of <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I>
on the best-seller lists.  Visit your local Christian bookstore
and obtain or order a copy there.  Christian booksellers play
an irreplaceable role in spreading the Word, attracting new Christians
and encouraging &quot;old&quot; ones.  Many of these establishments
exist on a shoestring, and they struggle at this time of year.
Please take a moment to drop by and let them know you appreciate
their presence in your community.

<p>

Have a blessed and enjoyable summer (may it be as storm-free
as possible, too!).  From all of us at Family Research Council,
thank you for your support, and God bless you.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S. Summers are a great time for families, a time for vacations
and building memories for a lifetime.  The only problem is that
cagey Washington insiders know that grassroots Americans are distracted
from their handling of critical issues. <b><i>This summer, FRC especially
needs your help</i></b>. The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) <I>must</I>
be passed before a Hawaiian court acts in August.  The
Partial-Birth Abortion bill <I>must</I> get a powerful vote in
the House this month to override Bill Clinton's veto.  And we
<i>must</i> push for desperately-needed tax relief for families with
children before Congress adjourns for the fall election campaigns.
I hope you will prayerfully consider giving us your financial
support this month.  With your help, I am convinced that we can
stay in the fight and win. Thank you and God bless you.

<title>Drunk on Power - Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>

<h3>DRUNK ON POWER</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/thierer.htm">Adam D. Thierer</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
September 12, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	With the fall elections just weeks away, there's one issue far more important to many Americans than presidential debates, congressional mudslinging or the latest Gallup poll. It's beer.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Specifically, the beer tax. This may come as a shock, but every time one of America's 75 million beer drinkers picks up a six-pack of his favorite brew, 43 percent of the cost comes directly from taxes, according to a study by the economic consulting firm DRI/McGraw-Hill. To put this in perspective, a $5 six-pack actually costs only $2.85 -- until you factor in the tax.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The proper response of the American people to this punitive level of taxation should be clear: revolt. At least that's what another group of Americans did when the federal government levied an excessive tax on their liquor. It was the Summer of 1794. To protest an excise tax placed on their whiskey three years earlier, angry citizens in the Northeastern states rose up against their federal overlords, tarring and feathering government officials and burning down their homes. Before you try this at home, a word of caution: The feds had a pretty strong opinion about the "Whiskey Rebellion" protesters. They shot them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Alas, it's not likely that we'll see today's overtaxed beer drinkers take to the streets. The reason: Beer drinkers have at best a dim understanding that they're even being taxed. The sales and excise taxes that apply to beer are largely "hidden." Consumers see only the final sales price of beer that rings up on the cash register, never realizing that their $15 case costs only $8.50 before taxes. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But just because beer taxes are hidden doesn't mean their effect isn't real, both on beer drinkers' wallets and on the economy. Consider: Since 1990, when beer taxes were boosted as part of a larger tax package, the beer industry has lost 60,000 jobs, according to The Beer Institute. When American brewers pay seven times more in taxes than they earn in profits, it's difficult to retain their workers. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	To add insult to injury, the other taxes that were part of the 1990 package -- notably on yachts, private planes, jewelry and furs -- have all been repealed. This is great for people with disposable incomes of around, say, a million dollars, but it does nothing for the little guy who pays the beer tax (nearly two-thirds of all the beer sold in America each year is bought by households earning less than $45,000). 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Fortunately, relief may be at hand. Rep. Phil English, R-Pa., has introduced legislation that would cut the beer tax in half -- back to its pre-1990 level. "Because they are concealed," English says, "these taxes engender little opposition from the taxpayers. But they contribute tangibly to the cost of living for hard-working Americans." No kidding. If you buy just one $5 six-pack a week, by the end of the year you've forked over $112 in taxes to the government. That's more than a full day's work for the average wage earner.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Of course, English's proposal is sure to meet with opposition from those who think cutting the beer tax will lead to increased alcohol consumption. These folks -- let's call them liberals -- view the tax code as a powerful tool for bending human behavior to fit their preferences. And at the moment, beer drinking is one activity definitely frowned upon by the wine-and-cheese crowd.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The ironies are delicious. Not only do liberals, the traditional advocates of "progressive" taxation, wind up supporting a tax that falls disproportionately on lower- and middle-income Americans, but these self-styled champions of "the worker" also ignore the fact that the beer tax hurts an industry that employs 2.6 million people -- everything from assembly-line workers in bottling plants to delivery-truck drivers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Let's face it, the beer tax is a raw deal. But don't expect change anytime soon. Maybe it's their nature, but too many lawmakers are addicted to controlling people's lives through levies like the beer tax. In short, they're drunk on power.
<p>

<title>Wrong Way to Honor Reagan -- Heritage Commentary</title>

<h3><i>Wrong Way To Honor Reagan</i></h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
January 26, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>
	What's the best way to pay tribute to a former president?  
<p>
	Well, some have had their faces chiseled into the sides of a famous mountain. A few have 
earned -- pardon the pun -- a stamp of approval, with their likeness adorning stamps issued by the 
U.S. Postal Service. Others appear on our dollar bills and coins. And some even get buildings 
named after them. Usually this makes a good deal of sense. Usually -- but not always. 
<P>
	Consider what's happening in Washington. A soon-to-be-famous building -- or maybe I 
should say, infamous -- now called the Federal Triangle Project needs a name.  
<p>
 	Located two blocks from the White House, this half-a-billion dollar government colossus is 
millions and millions of dollars over budget, lavish beyond compare, and almost four years behind 
schedule.  
<p>
	The building has 3.1 million square feet of space -- second in size only to the huge 
Pentagon complex, which has 3.9 million square feet. It sprawls across 11 acres and rises 10 stories 
high, with five more levels underground. When the complex opens in December 1996, it will have 
85 elevators, eight escalators, a six-story atrium, 13,000 doors, limestone exteriors, a limestone 
rotunda, 904 windows, several live-performance theaters, a health club, an elaborate food court, 
storefront offices, and plans for a 620-seat auditorium and movie theater. Now the bureaucrats can 
enjoy a movie during their extended coffee breaks! 
<p>
	As the most grandiose government building ever erected, the Federal Triangle Project 
represents the ultimate monument to government waste. 
<p>
	So whose name do you think they want to put on this monstrosity? Lyndon Johnson, who 
launched the government's failed $5.4 trillion War on Poverty? Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., 
maybe? He's long been known as Mr. Pork Barrel on Capitol Hill.  
<p>
	Nope. Actually official Washington has proposed naming the building after the man who 
tried hardest to stop wasteful government spending, the anti-waste crusader himself: Ronald 
Reagan. 
<p>
	Incredible, but true. Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole, R-Kan. and Sen. Daniel P.  
Moynihan, D-N.Y., want to honor the former president by naming the structure the Ronald 
Reagan Building and International Trade Center. 
<p>
	They ought to know better. Reagan is the one president in recent memory most identified 
with fighting big government. In his eight years in the White House, he waged a relentless battle to 
bring big government to heel. Now they want to honor this valiant effort with a building costing 
$656 million: the most expensive government building ever.
<p>
	Someone needs to stop this travesty. Ronald Reagan wanted to reduce the size of 
government, not expand it. He wanted to get the bureaucracy off the backs of the American people, 
not house it in palatial splendor. Naming this bureaucratic Taj Mahal in his honor seems the least 
fitting tribute I can think of.
<p>
	Ironically, some of the agencies hand-picked by Clinton administration officials to move 
into the complex would have been eliminated during the Reagan era if Congress would have gone 
along.
<p>
	There are lots of  better ways to honor President Reagan than by putting his name on this 
government monstrosity. As his son, radio talk-show host Michael Reagan, said recently, Ronald 
Reagan should be on Mount Rushmore. Not Mount Wastemore.

<TITLE> Charles A. Donovan Article</TITLE>

<CENTER><H3> Written Testimony of Charles A. Donovan,<BR>
Senior Policy Adviser<BR>
Submitted on May 2, 1995 to the<BR>
Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee,<BR>
Senator Nancy Kassebaum, Chairman</H3>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
MADAM CHAIRMAN, DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE, I am pleased to have the opportunity to offer the testimony of the Family Research Council on the nomination of Dr. Henry W. Foster to be Surgeon General of the United States.  The Family Research Council is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization dedicated to analysis of the impact of public policy on the traditional family.  We place particular emphasis on the ways in which society can preserve and strengthen the two-parent family, and maximize the benefits that stable, intact family structure can confer on this nation's economic vitality, social well-being and spiritual strength.
<P>
     We believe that the position of Surgeon General of the United States now, more than ever, requires an individual who understands these dimensions of public policy.  Evolu- tion of the office of Surgeon General in the past two decades has diminished its direct policy-making and admini- strative role.  Evolution of the nature of many of the public health threats facing this nation today has magnified the importance of the Surgeon General's office in articulat-ing the essentials of healthy behavior.  The intersection of individual health and moral responsibility has never been more obvious.
<P>
     For this reason, it is critical that the office of Surgeon General be occupied by a person who has worked comfortably within that intersection.  That person must possess a clear, and consistently expressed, vision of public health.  He or she must be alive to the profound ethical dimensions of health issues in the late 20th century, and have a proven track record of responding cor-rectly to issues as they arise, not merely riding with the tide of public or professional opinion.  In short, he or she must be a leader, not a follower, intellectually and instinctively true to the highest standards of ethical behavior in medicine.  
<P>
     As a threshold matter, a Surgeon General must know and be able to articulate who he is and what he believes.  From the very beginning, when President Clinton announced his choice of Herny Foster on February 2, this nominee has been unable to articulate from one day to the next a consistent account even of his own career.  At every turn, members of this committee, of our own organization, and of the press have elicited from Dr. Foster and the administration new and revised accounts of various dimensions of his creed and his practice.  To this day, not one of these accounts fully squares with the other.  To this day, not one of these accounts amounts to a full disclosure by the nominee regard-ing his personal involvement in the most wrenching health policy questions of our time.
<P>
     The course of this nomination resembles a tent in spring rain.  Touch its soggy canvas anywhere and more revelations seep through.  It is hard to imagine an individual who has been implicared in more major public health controversies than Dr. Foster.  From the Tuskegee syphilis experiment, to involuntary sterilization of men-tally handicapped women, to the performance of abortions and advocacy of abortion on demand, to distribution of condoms and other birth control devices to children, to the school-based clinic debate, to involvement with radical sex education programs, Dr. Foster has been on the cutting edge -- and nearly always on its wrong side.
<P>
     As this testimony is written, it is impossible to say with assurance that he hasn't <B> always </B>been on the wrong side, because nothing of what is known about Dr. Foster's role in each of these controversies is the result of the nominee's frank and full disclosure.  Everything that is known about them is the result of examination of the nominee's record and repeated questioning of that record by others, our-selves included.  The Administration has been reluctant to take the first step to volunteer accurate information about any of the issues that have placed this nomination in jeopardy.
<P>
     Before discussing those issues in detail, I want to make one final point.  This nomination has not been, and is not being, "Borked."  No one has led an advertising campaign distorting the nominee's record, impugning his character, or implying dreaded, unnamed consequences for the nation if he takes office.  No one has scrolled through a list of his tastes in videos. The debate over this nomination is first and foremost about profoudnly important questions of public policy, and this nomination is in difficulty first and fore-most because the nominee himself has been unable to provide a consistent and accurate account of where he has stood and what he has done regarding these questions.  Even Robert Bork's most vociferous opponents will agree, I think, that he did not leave anyone in doubt about the authenticity of his beliefs.
<P>
     Doubt, on the other hand, is the essence of Dr. Foster's nomination.
<P>
<B> Biographical Omission</B>
<P>
     The difficulty with Dr. Foster's nomination began with the refusal of the White House to share with the public, and with this committee, his basic philosophy.  The biography of Dr. Foster released by the White House mentioned his chron-ological affiliations, but totally ignored his lifelong ties to Planned Parenthood.  That this would be the occasion for controversy can hardly be something the Administration would not recognize.  The <I> Chronicle of Philanthropy </I>has noted on several occasions that the Planned Parenthood Federation of America is among the top 10 most frequently objected to "charities" in the United States.  The <I> Chronicle </I>has reported that no nonprofit in the United States is more commonly eschewed through "restricted" gifts to the nation's United Way agencies.
<P>
     The reasons are simple, and to express them is to belie the White House's claim that Dr. Foster is a "mainstream" nominee.  The nominee claims that he is committed to absti- nence as the primary approach to sex education.  Planned Parenthood has led the ideological and legal assault on abstinence education programs in the United States.  The nominee claims that he desires to make abortion "safe, legal and rare."  But he has served as a "Public Policy Advocate" for the Planned Parenthood Federation during a time when its national leadership had dedicated itself to opening 75 abortion clinics across the United States<I> merely to meet a numerical goal consonant with the 75th anniversary of its founding</I>.
<P>
     Dr. Foster has sought to portray himself as an advocate for the family, and for parent-child communication.  But during his time as an official of Planned Parenthood of Nashville, that organization filed suit against a Tennessee law requiring parental consent for abortion.  Far from being a strict statute, that law provided for a judicial bypass procedure by which teenagers could seek abortions under court auspices without parental involvement.  Such an arrangement was not liberal enough for Planned Parenthood, which has led the national legal fight to exclude parents from involvement with their minor children's abortion decisions.  Again, this is not a mainstream position -- Americans support parental consent for abortion by margins of 2-1 or 3-1.  Parents themselves show an even higher rate of support for such laws.
<P>
     It is possible that Dr. Foster was and is ignorant of these positions taken by organizations with whom he has been associated for nearly two decades.  But it is not likely. Ignorance is a valid defense in some circumstances, but it is not a valid credential for someone who seeks to become the "nation's doctor," and the leader of a national crusade against teenage pregnancy.
<P>
     The American people had a right to know of Dr. Foster's association with this organization and its ideas.  The White House had no right to omit it from the biographical informa-tion it provided the Congress and the nation.
<P>
<B> Tuskegee Institute</B>
<P>
     "Ignorance" is also the nominee's defense against the circumstantial evidence, and the direct testimony of one individual, Dr. Luther McRae, that, as Vice President of the Macon County Medical Society in 1969, Dr. Foster partic-ipated in a Public Health Service briefing on the infamous Tuskegee syphilis experiments.  It is not in dispute that Dr, Foster spoke out against the experiments in 1972, when they were publicly revealed in media accounts.  It is pre-cisely that public expression of outrage that provoked the reaction of Dr. McRae, who has stated that he is willing to testify to this committee under oath that Dr. Foster was indeed present at the meeting on May 12, 1969 where PHS officials sought the "surrogate informed consent" of the MCMS for continuation of the Tuskegee Study.<P>
     McRae is categorical, and here is what he told Carl Ramsey of Family News in Focus:
<P>
<UL> The most striking thing about it, when
         the news broke . . . I saw on television
         and read in the papers that Dr. Foster 
         was involved in the public outrage about
         the study having been conducted.  And I
         was struck by that, in that I knew he was
         at the meeting . . . I asked myself why
         Henry didn't go ahead and say something at
         the meeting that night in 1969. Because he
         had every opportunity, nobody had a muzzle
         on him.i</UL><P>     McRae is also specific, recalling where Dr. Foster sat.  Moreover, he holds no animus against his colleague and believes -- in contrast to my view -- that he would make an excellent Surgeon General.  This fact lends added weight to his assertion regarding Dr. Foster's knowledge of the Tus-kegee experiment in 1969.
<P>
     Dr. McRae insists that Henry Foster did know about the existence of the experiment.  But it is equally important to recognize that he should have known, and that the May 12 meeting at a restaurant outside Tuskegee was not his only opportunity to inform himself about a PHS study that had been under way for nealry four decades.  First, the study had been described in the medical journals; as an obstetric-ical chief working in a county with one of the nation's highest rates of syphilis (indeed, this was one reason PHS originally chose Macon County as the site of the nontreat-ment study), at perhaps that county's most prominent ob-gy
center, Dr. Foster would have reason to be well read in the literature of venereal disease.
<P>
     Dr. McRae has noted, as does James Jones' account of the Tuskegee experiment, Bad Blood, that PHS officials supplied the Macon County Medical Society with a list of the individuals "participating" in the study, to assure that they would not obtain treatment, particularly antibiotics, by other means from local physicians.ii  Given the "zeal," as Jones puts it, with which PHS officials pursued the cooper- ation of Macon County physicians, it seems unlikely that distribution of this list to the Vice President of the Society's Vice President would be overlooked.<P>    Jones also points out that in 1970the PHS "also reestablished something of its former working relationship with medical personnel at John A. Andrew Hospital."  A representative of PHS, Dr. Joseph G. Caldwell, met with the hospital's administrator and medical director and contracted to have the surviving men's X-rays taken there in the hospital's new facility.  Again, it is possible that the presence of PHS officials, and the conduct of examinations of the syphilitic men, in the facility where he was chief of obstetrics would have entirely escaped the notice of Dr. Foster.  
<P>
     Assuming as much, however, it is hardly a flattering protrayal of Dr. Foster's engagement with public health issues when the most significant events of his time took place in his immediate vicinity, with the cooperation of the Medical Society of which he was Vice President, without his taking cognizance of them.  Such a lapse may not amount to much for a physician who simply desires to continue his work serving the general population; it is a fatal failure of responsibility in an individual who claims to have the ability to serve as the nation's top spokesman on public health.  Dr. Foster says that he did not know of the exper- iments.  The key is that nearly all his colleagues did, that at least one says that he himself did, and that, in any case, he should have known.
<P>
<B> Dr. Foster and Abortion</B>
<P>
     On the issue of abortion, Dr. Foster has taken the fifth.  That is to say, he has taken at least five posi- tions on the number of abortions he has performed or guided to completion.  He has misstated not merely his own involvement in abortion, but inaccurately described the guidelines on medical education under which, he claims, a study of prostaglandin suppositories was conducted during his tenure at Meharry Medical School.  Worse, he has used language in documents officially released by the Department of Health and Human Services that finesses the question of his involvement in abortion.  These finesses put his vera-city not merely in question, but in grave doubt.  
<P>
    Let me summmarize:<P>
<UL> <B> Late January.  </B>A White House official informs<BR>
      Chairman Kassebaum that Dr. Foster had per-<BR>
      formed one abortion during his medical career.<BR>
      ("Foster Says He Performed Abortions,"<I> The Wash-<BR>
      ington Post</I>, Feb. 4, 1995).
<P>
 <B> February 3, 1995.  </B>The Department of Health<BR>
       and Human Services releases a statement by<BR>
       Dr. Foster which states, " I believe that I<BR>
       performed fewer than a dozen pregnancy term-<BR>
       inations." (Statement by Dr. Henry Foster,<BR>
       Nominee for U.S. Surgeon General.)
<P>
 <B> February 6, 1995.  </B>The International Foundation<BR>
       for Genetic Research/Michael Fund releases a<BR>
       transcript, first disputed by the White House<BR>
       but then acknowledged to be genuine, in which<BR>
       Foster states, "I have done a lot of amniocen-<BR>
       tesis and therapeutic abortions, probably near<BR>
       700." (Department of Health, Education and Wel-<BR>
       fare, Office of the Secretary, Ethics Advisory<BR>
       Board, Meeting V, Friday, November 10, 1978<BR>
       Seattle, Washington, p. 180, 197).
<P>
       The Foundation also releases a story from the<BR>
       November 1980 <I> ObGyn News </I>describing an abortion-<BR>
       pill study conducted by Dr. Foster at Meharry on<BR>
       behalf of Upjohn Pharmaceuticals that resulted in<BR>
        59 completed abortions on patients in the trial.     <BR>
<P>
 <B> February 8, 1995.  </B>Appearing on ABC's<I> Nightline</I>,<BR>
        Dr. Foster acknowledges performing 39 abortions, but<BR>
       notes that this does not include any abortions he<BR>
       may have performed before 1973.  Foster tells Kop-<BR>
       pel that this total also does not include the 59<BR>
       abortions carried out under the trial he super-<BR>
       vised, because he did not personally perform them.</UL>
 <P>
     Thus, in little more than a week, Dr. Foster deployed five different versions of his record regarding abortions.<P>
Volatility like this makes the Mexican peso look stable by comparison.  It prompted even the spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, Avis LaVelle, to remark, "The next time we utter a number [of Foster's abortions], it won't be based on Dr. Foster's recollec-tions."iii  But if you take a closer look at the February 3 statement released over his name, it appears amply crafted to disguise the information that was released on February 6 by the International Foundation for Genetic Research.<P>     As <I> The Washington Times </I>pointed out on February 7, Dr. Foster's artful February 3 statement offered circumlocu- tions regarding his term as chief of service at Tuskegee and Meharry.  Of the "wide variety of medical procedures and research" performed at both, "all," he wrote, "were in accordance with the law and educational requirements."iv  As the <I> Times </I>observed, "Abortion . . . has been legal for many years, and thus had Dr. Foster performed hundreds of abortions as chief of service - as opposed to acting in his capacity as a private physician - that fact would not have been actually lied about, given the statement's careful wording."
<P>
     The same can be said about the prostaglandin supposi- tory trial, which Dr. Foster was compelled to elaborate upon the following night in his exchange with Ted Koppel.  There he launched the "educational requirements" explanation, citing alleged accreditation requirements as the justifi- cation for seeking grant money to test the abortion suppos- itory for Upjohn.  There are two issues here.  One is the intended evasion by Dr. Foster of a full accounting of his abortion activity in his February 3 statement.  The second is his misunderstanding -- or possible evasion -- regarding the rationale for the prostaglandin trial.
<P>
     As chief of obstetrics at two major medical instituti- tions, Dr. Foster surely should have known that nothing in the then-extant accreditation guidelines from the Accredi-tation Council for Graduate Medical Education required any medical school to offer training in performing abortions, much less to conduct trials of experimental abortion drugs.  In relevant part, the guidelines state that:
<P>
<UL> Resident education [in obstetrics and<BR>
         gynecology] must include, but not neces-<BR>
         sarily be limited to the following:<BR>
<P>
         1. Obstetrics<BR>
         a. The full range of obstetrics, includ-<BR>
            ing high-risk obstetrics and medical<BR>
            and surgical complications of pregnancy.</UL>
<P>
     Arguably this standard could be interpreted as requiring training in the management of complications resulting from botched abortions, although the term "abor-tion" (or any euphemism for it) is nowhere mentioned in the standards.  Even under this reading of the standard, however, it would clearly be unethical for a program to arrange for a botched abortion to give the residents a training opportunity.  Conducting a trial of a new drug (one that never did reach the market) would just as clearly be an unethical way to fulfill such an obligation.
<P>
     But the bottom line is that no such obligation existed in the late 1970s when the trial was conducted, nor does one exist now, when Dr. Foster cites it as justification for Meharry's participation in the Phase 2 trial and uses it as a mask for a major abortion activity he obviously did not want disclosed.  It is only an added insult to common knowl- edge when Foster continues to cite this erroneous account of accreditation requirements to justify a project that was clearly taken on because of Dr. Foster's lifelong commitment to abortion.
<P>
     Finally, it should be pointed out that as of the date of this testimony, March 24, 1995, a complete accounting of Dr. Foster's activity on behalf of abortion is still not in the public record.  He has specifically excluded revelations regarding any abortions he may have performed prior to 1973, when he began his association with Meharry.  His basis for the exclusion is the unavailability of records prior to that date.  Given how well Dr. Foster's "recollections" have served him and the administration on other issues, it's just as well.
<P>
<B> Involuntary Sterilization</B>
<P>
     Dr. Foster's involvement in the possily involuntary sterilization of four mentally handicapped women is the only controversial issue in his background that was placed before the public by action of the White House.  Its discovery, however, was inevitable, as Dr. Foster himself described the prcedures in an article entitled "Removal of the Normal Uterus" in the <I> Southern Medical Journal </I>in 1976.v  Dr. Foster states in the article only that he had "begun to use hysterectomy in patients with severe mental retardation.  Hysterectomy," he noted, "can be done <I>eithe</I>r [emphasis added] for sterilization or to eliminate the menses[.]"vi<P>     Whatever the presumed indication for the procedure, obviously hysterectomy eliminates both fertility and the menses.  This is important because hysterectomy carries significantly higher risks to the mother than the conven-tional means of sterilization (salpingectomy, i.e., removal of the Fallopian tubes).  As Stephen Trombley's valuable history of coercive sterilization makes clear, the United States in the early 1970s experienced a "sterilization explosion."vii  At least part of the impetus for the proce- dure (besides the desire of Planned Parenthood and other population control groups to promote permanent methods of sterilization, particularly on eugenic grounds) was the desire to provide medical students with the opportunity to perform hysterectomies.viii<P>
     This "sterilization explosion" did not go unnoticed or unopposed.  In fact, by 1973 the Health Research Group, affiliated with Ralph Nader's Public Citizen, Inc. had pub-lished a major report on sterilization abuse.  The report documented the sudden rise in sterilization, particularly targeting the indigent, the uneducated and the young, and called for federal regulation, especially to ensure informed consent.
<P>
     This report provided the statistical and anecdotal basis for federal interest in sterilization reform, but as Trombley writes, the report attained its full effect "only after the problem of sterilization abuse was heightened by the personal tragedy of the Relf family."ix<P>     Interestingly, the Relf case took place in Alabama in 1973.  Once again a major public health controversy brewed virtually under Dr. Henry Foster's nose, without his being aware of it, and at a time when had begun to perform hyster- ectomies.  The Relf case deserves a brief synopsis.  A poor balck family living in Montgomery, the Relfs had three daughters, ages 12 to 16.  At the behest of the local family planning service, the three girls were injected with the contraceptive drug Depo-Provera.  In March 1973, the oldest girl, Katie was taken, without her parents' consent, to a family planning clinic, where an IUD was inserted over her objections.
<P>
     A series of events then brought the remaining two girls, along with their mother, to a local hospital, where the mother, unable to read or write, was induced to place an "X" on a document authorizing them, without hr knowledge, to be sterilized.  A subsequent effort by the family planning service to sterilize Katie failed.  
<P>
     That summer, the Relf case came to the attention of Sen. Edward Kennedy, who on July 10, 1973 invited the Relfs to his office.  By happenstance, Sen. Kennedy's committee was at that same time engaged in the hearings on health care and human experimentation spawned by the Tuskegee incident.  The Relfs proceeded to file suit against the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, resulting in a judgment requiring the federal government to issue guidelines providing for the protection of minors from sterilization and for informed consent.
<P>
     Contemporaneous with <I> Relf </I>was the <I> Wyatt </I>case, in which a federal court declared unconstitutional an Alabama law that permitted the sterilization of mentally retarded inmates of state institutions.  Although compulsory steril-ization remained legal in many states during the 1970s, the issues raised by the Health Research Group and debated in the federal courts in Alabama had risen to national prominence two to three years before Dr. Foster's article appeared in<I> the Southern Medical Journal</I>.  Despite this fact, Foster's article makes no mention of these develop- ments, and betrays no awareness of any kind that, even in his own state, he was part of a rapidly dying consensus that such sterilizations as he had "begun" to perform were med- ically and morally unacceptable.
<P>
     As columnist Charles Krauthammer wrote on February 17, the circumstances surrounding these surgical sterilizations (why higher-risk hysterectomies were performed, whether informed consent was obtained, and from whom) involve serious questions.  The apologia that Foster performed only four such sterilizations does not answer these questions; in fact, as Krauthammer notes, "It breyas an obvious discomfort with what Foster did.  It reinforces the sense that the moral climate of the 1970s was not nearly as alien as some pretend and that even in that ancient time surgically sterilizing the retarded was a morally troubling act."x<P>    I only note in passing that Dr. Foster's first account of abortions he performed was one.  Once again, Foster failed to notice a major public health controversy that sprang up largely as a result of incidents just down the road from the institutions he helped to lead.<P><B> I Have a Future</B><P>     The plausibility of Dr. Foster's commitment to abstinence as his first priority in educating young people about sexuality was discussed above.  One example should suffice.
<P>
     In 1987 the Planned Parenthood Federation of America distributed a report written for it by Marie Haviland-James, apparently affiliated with Michigan Planned parenthood.  The report was an ideological assault on "Sex Respect," one of the most venerable abstinence education programs in the United States.  The following account of the Haviland-James report appears in an analysis of sex education programs written and published in 1991:
<P>
<UL> The Haviland-James report provided guidance<BR>
       to Planned parenthood sex educators opposing<BR>
 <I> Sex Respect </I>and seeking its removal from the<BR>
       schools.  The memo urged opponents of <I> Sex <BR>
       Respect </I>to argue that it "violates the separa-<BR>
       tion of church and state" and risks litigation<BR>
       from the American Civil Liberties Union {whose<BR>
       late counsel, Harriet Pilpel, once represented<BR>
       both organizations].  It charged that the pro-<BR>
       gram is faulty because it contained "many refer-<BR>
       ences . . . to a 'spiritual' dimension of sex-<BR>
       uality; contained use of the word 'baby' for<BR>
       fetus"; expressed "bias . . . against people<BR>
       who are sexually active and unmarried"; "com-<BR>
       pared stealing of money continually with con-<BR>
       tinued sexual activity'; contained " a descrip-<BR>
       tion of a woman haunted by guilt"; omitted <BR>
       "pro-choice material"; and, of greatest inter-<BR>
       est, included "unsubstantiated claims" such as<BR>
       "abstinence has future benefits for teens" and<BR>
       "because of the special nature of human sexual-<BR>
       ity, there's no way to have premarital sex <BR>
       without hurting someone."  The memo concluded<BR>
       that <I> Sex Respect </I>"appeals . . . to the lowest <BR>
       common denominator of mentality."xi</UL><P>     Once again, the most chartible interpretation that can be put on Dr. Foster's involvement with an organization that takes this aggressive a stance against abstinence education is that he is wholly unaware of it.  Fortunately, there is more direct evidence of Dr. Foster's approach, which is at best "abstinence-plus," with the abstinence part thrust with embarrassment up his sleeve.
<P>
     The Family Research Council has obtained a copy of the eight-page brochure produced by Foster's "I Have a Future" program to introduce the program.  Over a couple of thousand of words of text, the word "abstinence", or its equivalents is not mentioned once.  The phrase, "delaying the initiation of sexual activity," common in all true abstinence materials, is not mentioned once.  On the other hand, the brochure repeatedly stresses the objective of the program to enhance "contraceptive availability," to address the problem of "poor" "contraceptive practices," and to promote "distribution of contraceptives."xii<P>     Efforts by the Council and the media to obtain a full copy of the "I Have a Future" curriculum have been rebuffed.xiii  If the currciulum is as its sponsors say it is, this reaction to public curioisity is itself curious.  In fact, one would expect that, upon his elevation to Surgeon General, Dr. Foster would proudly promote the "I Have a Future" curriculum as a model abstinence program.  His pride should be just as great before this committee votes.<P><B> Conclusion</B><P>    These are but a few of the issues that attend the nomination of Dr. Herny Foster.  Ther common link is that in 1995, the United States deserves to have in this position of authority an individual with a clear vision of the public health consequences of personal behavior, an abiding commit- ment to marriage and the family, an alertness to the ethical dimensions of today's contemporary controversies in medicine and public policy, an unblemished record of candor and truth-telling to the American people, and a concern for every mother and child.  
<P>
     Henry Foster has shown that he is not that person.

<title> Women Don't Need Affirmative Action - Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>

<h3> Women Don't Need Affirmative Action </h3>

By Sally C. Pipes and Michael Lynch<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
July 25, 1996
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;


	A well-financed, pro-affirmative action propaganda campaign is underway to defeat the California Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI), an amendment to California's constitution that would prohibit the state from granting preference -- or discriminating -- on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion or sex. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Much of this pro-affirmative action, anti-CCRI campaign is focused on women.  The obvious reason: Women are a bigger voting bloc than minorities, the usual target of such campaigns. If most women can be convinced that race- and sex-based preferences are fair, that could decide the battle. And this is a battle whose outcome could easily affect the lives of both men and women across the nation.   
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	That's why it is important to understand why women should reject race- and sex-based "affirmative action." There are at least four reasons.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	First, like men, women believe in equality before the law. They believe racial, ethnic and gender preferences violate the proposition that all men and women are created equal. Women know their advances in the workplace and voting booth have come not by departing from this creed, but by upholding it -- by showing that America wasn't living up to its own principles of equality. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Second, women are mothers, wives, daughters and sisters. No one is better placed than a woman to see the double-edged nature of racial and gender preferences. It is clear to a mother that an institutional preference for her daughter is institutional discrimination against her son. Susan Constantine, a mother of three boys, made precisely this point in a letter to the San Francisco Chronicle. "I find affirmative action and the like racist and sexist ... Just as I am opposed to racism and sexism, I am opposed to this form of unequal opportunity toward our sons."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Third, women themselves often are treated unfairly under affirmative action plans. Consider the case of Lydia Cheryl McDonald. A Los Angeles resident, McDonald grew up in a broken home and lived on welfare after her father abandoned her family. Yet she accumulated a grade-point average in high school of 4.5 -- on a four point scale -- due to credit for advanced placement classes. In addition to working 15 hours a week, McDonald wracked up an impressive list of achievements and awards, including high honors on California's prestigious Golden State Exam for geometry. She is exactly the kind of candidate the University of California at Berkeley claims to be looking for: high-achieving, well rounded, but poor.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In March 1996, McDonald received a rejection letter informing her that "we sought an academically strong freshman class which includes students from a wide range of cultural, ethnic, geographic, racial and socio-economic backgrounds." In other words, "diversity" was more important than excellence. Had it not been for the intervention of a lawyer so outraged by McDonald's case that he offered his services pro bono and threatened the University with a lawsuit, Lydia would not be looking forward to spring admission.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Finally, women know that their most significant advances in the workplace have not resulted from affirmative action, but from equality of opportunity and hard work.  A modern political mantra has it that white women have been the greatest beneficiaries of quota-based affirmative action. But academic analysis finds little conclusive evidence that women, on the whole, have benefited from such preferences.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Women have made progress in all segments of the work force in the last 30 years. As Anita K. Blair, executive vice president of the Independent Women's Forum recently pointed out, the most important reason is that women went to college. In 1960, only 19 percent of bachelor's degrees went to women. By 1995, women claimed 55 percent of B.A.s. During the same period, women increased their share of lucrative professional degrees -- M.B.A.s, M.D.s and J.D.s -- by more than 500 percent. The increase in college enrollment is a result not of affirmative action, but of changing personal choices.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Today, half of all professionals are female, and women hold nearly half of all managerial and executive positions. Women are starting their own businesses in droves. In 1995, according to the National Foundation for Women Business Owners, women owned nearly 8 million businesses with more than $2.25 trillion in sales.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Those fighting the California Civil Rights Initiative are saying, in essence, that  women need the government's help in order to compete. But the facts do not support this view. Women should not fall for the sophistry and hypocrisy of organized interests who actually benefit from the perpetual racial and sexual strife caused by affirmative action. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	After all, a society where equal rights are protected by the full force of the law is as beneficial to women as it is to men. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<title>Gary Bauer's November, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

November 6, 1996

<p>

Dear Friend,

<p>

I know that your first reaction to yesterday's election returns 
is to be disheartened. I found myself recalling the words of Thomas 
Jefferson, who suggested that we should tremble for our country as 
we consider that God is just.

<p>

But, my friends, as people of faith devoted to the family, there must 
be no room in our hearts for demoralization.  It is not just that 
there were many bright spots on Election Day, including the 
strengthening of pro-family forces in Congress.  No, it's the fact 
that we are obliged in conscience to carry on our fight for the family, 
no matter what one day's election returns suggest. The worst thing we 
could do now is to retreat from the public square.  Instead we must 
advance the pro-family banner boldly and without shame.  I have hope 
for the future -- because the truth is on our side, 
the lessons of history are on our side, and, I believe, the will of 
the people is on our side.

<p>

I am not naive.  In the coming year, the principles that unite us -- 
traditional values, the sanctity of human life, smaller government, 
and lower taxes -- will be under political and cultural attack as 
never before. Regarding these threats, I can speak only for me and my 
"house" at the Family Research Council: "We will redouble our efforts to 
speak for your values and to bring the truth to the American people."

<p>

With that in mind, as election day approached, my staff and I put 
together a six-point plan of action.  Today, as the final vote is 
still being tallied we begin to implement this plan, with you at our side.

<p><ul>

<li>Pro-family Americans have been too passive -- not <i>too active</i>! -- 
in their approach to public life.  Too often we've waited for our party system 
to produce for us candidates who will subscribe to some portion of our 
world view, candidates who, by design and default, always seem to fail 
us at the finish line.  The truth is, our movement should be producing 
and promoting leaders of its own.  I want you to know that achieving 
this goal is at the top of my personal priorities for the coming year. 
In my capacity as a private citizen, I will be organizing a political 
action committee, which I believe you'll be hearing a lot about in 
the near future.

<p>

<li>Each month 250,000 American homes receive our monthly publication, 
<i>Washington Watch</i>.  With your help, <b>FRC will double the 
circulation of this publication within the next 12 months</b>. Early 
next year <b>FRC will unveil a new and expanded version of <i>Watch</i></b>. 
We must make it our goal <b>to reach every American home in which 
there still burns a spark of love for this land Lincoln called 
"the last, best hope of Earth."</b>

<p>

<li>FRC will launch a youth leadership program here in Washington, 
D.C.  If the family is to survive (my friends, it <i>will</i> survive), 
if religious values are not to be completely routed from the public 
square (my friends, they <i>will</i> not), <b>we must act now to foster a 
new generation of leaders with a profoundly Christian world view.</b> The 
darker this night of cultural amorality becomes, the more youthful 
flames we must light that will kindle hope for our country.

<p>

<li>Our very self-government is at stake when the acts of duly elected 
legislatures, or of the people themselves, to restrict abortion, protect 
parental rights, and safeguard the institution of marriage are trampled 
by our runaway judges.  Judicial tyranny must end.  I pledge to you 
today <b>a sweeping campaign to check and balance our out-of-control 
courts.</b> We must become again a people who insist that <b>no one govern 
us without our consent.</b>

<p>

<li>The power to tax is the power to destroy.  How many of our 
government's destructive schemes would be possible if it did not 
seize nearly 45 cents of every dollar that hardworking families 
earn? There will be no freedom without tax freedom. <b>Today I am 
launching, in partnership with key economic conservative organizations, 
a massive push for across-the-board tax relief.</b> We will begin with 
tax credits for families with children and end the double taxation 
that occurs when government taxes the estates our families have 
shored up over a lifetime of sweat and sacrifice. <b>Our families 
built this capital; the meddling Washington establishment must be 
stopped from hauling it away.</b>

<p>

<li>Early in the new year, FRC will convene a summit of leaders of 
major pro-family groups and religious leaders who share our profound 
concern for the cultural decay now gripping the Western world. We will 
pool ideas and, where possible, resources to provide an effective 
counter to the forces of cultural disintegration.  Our response will be 
as global as the threat we face.  In the coming months and years, it is 
imperative that pro-family groups work together. <b>I pledge my total 
effort to help achieve this goal.</b>

</ul><p>

One final word. I do not view these steps as an ambitious plan. This 
is the <b>minimum</b> we must do to give this generation, and the next 
generation, of American families a fighting chance.  I cannot promise 
you we will succeed at everything we do, but I can promise you that we 
will try as never before. FRC has been positioned -- I pray by 
God's grace -- in the nation's capital to be here for the family at 
such a time as this.

<p>

In the coming days, please consider this plan and let me know if I have 
your support.  Your prayers and encouragement mean so much, and your 
financial support is FRC's very lifeblood.  I know that you are counting 
on the Family Research Council.  We will do everything we can to be worthy 
of the trust you place in us. God bless you.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<title>Whistling In The Dark -- Heritage </title>
<center><h2> Whistling In The Dark</h2><br>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>September 28, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>

<p>Congress is crashing head-on into the devastating problem of illegitimacy, and balking. 
<p>Decades after liberal ideology declared marriage obsolete and liberal welfare policy discouraged it, America has reaped a bitter harvest: Millions of children growing up without dads, and moms struggling through life without much hope for the future.
<p>Congress is now trying to hash out the differences between House and Senate versions of a comprehensive welfare-reform bill. Unfortunately, liberals of both parties seem determined to join with President Clinton and block reforms that could help avert further social catastrophe. They are on the verge of shooting down a plan to deny welfare increases to unwed mothers who have more children while they're on welfare. That means: Taxpayers will continue to subsidize out-of-wedlock births.
<p>Yet, the numbers are stark and incontrovertible. We are becoming a nation of fatherless children. And fatherless children grow up to commit more violent crime, take more illegal drugs and become statistics in more social pathologies than any other group.
<p>Unmarried mothers gave birth to 80 percent of all black children born in the inner city in 1994. But the problem goes far beyond the inner city. In 1965, when a worried young strategist in the Johnson administration's War on Poverty warned of  the end of the black family, 25 percent of all black births were to unmarried mothers. Today, nearly 30 percent of all births in America -- regardless of color  -- are to unmarried mothers.
<p>In other words, the country as a whole has now gone further down the road of family disintegration than the black family had in 1965. Sadly, Sen. Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y. -- who first warned of this problem -- is now among the senators blocking genuine welfare reform.
<p>America must stop providing a financial incentive for women on welfare to have children out of wedlock. The only way to do that is to cut off additional payments to those who have more babies while on public assistance, and to deny benefits to girls under 18 who give birth to illegitimate children.
<p>This is not as heartless as it sounds -- after all, does your boss give you an automatic raise if you have more children? If you were contemplating a new addition to the family and your boss said, sure, we'll give you a raise to take care of it, wouldn't you be more likely to go ahead? 
<p>Meaningful welfare reform also must require mothers to name the fathers of their children as a condition of receiving welfare payments -- to make dads pay child support.
<p>The alternative is to just keep whistling in the dark. If Congress can't muster the courage to take these measures, here's what's in store for America:
<p><ul>
<li>Crime -- A state-by-state analysis by The Heritage Foundation found a 17 percent increase in juvenile crime for every 10 percent hike in the number of children living in single-parent homes. Get ready to pay higher taxes for more policemen, more judges, more prisons and more dangerous neighborhoods.
<li>Health -- Babies born to unmarried mothers face a "substantially higher risk" of  serious infant health problems, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. More money, therefore, will be needed for Medicaid.
<li>Education -- Children from single-parent homes do more poorly in school, and are more likely to be truant or have disciplinary problems, according to the National Association of Elementary School Principals. Schools will become more dangerous and kids will learn even less.
<li>Economy -- Problems in school mean problems in the workplace. Look for lower productivity and higher unemployment.</ul>
<p>When are liberal politicians in Washington going to get it? The brand of "compassion" they've been dealing out is killing us. It's time to do something about it.

<title>United Nations Day: No Cause for Celebration  - Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">

<h3>UNITED NATIONS DAY:  NO CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION</h3>
By Brett Schaefer<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
October 24, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	
	On Oct. 24, we all were expected to bear witness to the great achievements of the United Nations. The organization and its supporters scrambled to hide its misdeeds and dust off its few accomplishments. But they failed to conceal the truth. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The United Nations, despite the claims of reform by Secretary General Boutros-Boutros Ghali and the Clinton administration, remains rife with abuse, waste, fraud and ineffectiveness. Topping the list is wasteful spending on both materials and personnel. In a 1995 article, <i>Money</i> magazine revealed that U.N. employees commonly earn more than twice the pay of comparable positions in New York-based private-sector jobs. In addition to their salaries, the roughly 10,000 U.N. bureaucrats in New York receive an array of special perks including rent allowances and education grants for their children. To top it off, it's all tax free. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	These lucrative positions are, for the most part, not even being filled with competent individuals. Vested interests regard U.N. jobs as opportunities for nepotism and high pay for little work. U.N. employees are not held to any realistic standards of employee evaluation. The U.N. bureaucracy is populated by individuals who fail to meet the basic requirements of an effective civil service. The evaluation system is so abysmal that the U.N. leadership has tried to reform it at least five times. Yet the current system, under which 90 percent of U.N. employees received "excellent" ratings in the recent past, continues with only cosmetic changes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Of course, such employees aren't anxious to have their work habits exposed. In 1995 the United Nations bought a $1 million turnstile security system for its New York headquarters, but never used it. The reason: The turnstile clocks would have recorded the arrival and departure times of U.N. employees. Heaven forbid: They would have had to work an entire day.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Unfortunately, the full range of problems remains hidden because, until 1995, the world body refused to establish an inspector general's office to root out waste, corruption and inefficiency. When it finally did appoint an inspector general, it did so reluctantly, under threat from the U.S. Congress to withhold funding. Moreover, U.N. officials weakened the office by having the inspector general serve under the authority of the secretary general and by failing to grant the office an independent budget.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This incredible commitment to waste and inefficiency has spurred the United States -- which provides 25 percent of U.N. funding -- to periodically withhold some of its dues. This has resulted in arrears of approximately $1.2 billion. Congress has refused to pay these arrears until the United Nations pledges to undertake reform.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The United States has chosen the proper course. The world body is in a perpetual state of financial crisis and is cash strapped. Withholding funding is the most effective way to get the U.N. bureaucracy's attention and encourage reform. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The first step toward reform must be an independent audit. The problems can't be fixed until we know in detail what they are. This can best be accomplished by an independent inspector general with a competent staff and budget immune to U.N. pressure. The U.N. system has resisted past reform efforts and will not refrain from using budget blackmail to manipulate the inspector general's office. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It is also imperative that the inspector general have complete access to all U.N. and related agency records. A primary goal of this audit should be  not only to identify corruption, waste, fraud and abuse, but also to identify which of the United Nation's 70-plus programs are worth continuing, which should be eliminated, and which should be transferred to other organizations that can perform them better.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Only when such an audit is completed and management and organizational reforms have been implemented should U.S. back dues be paid. For the United States to pay in full before reform is implemented would be like giving a child his allowance before he completes his chores. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Only after an independent audit has been performed and U.N. operations reformed  can Americans sincerely say "Happy United Nations Day."

<title>Gary Bauer's February, 1996 Letter</title>
<body>
<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>
<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>
February 7, 1996
<p>
Dear Friend:
<p>
Hillary Rodham Clinton has written a new book.  It isn't supposed
to be about herself, but in one disturbing sense it is a biography.
Mrs. Clinton's book -- <i>It Takes a Village and Other Lessons Children
Teach Us</i> -- attempts to write the biography of the next generation
of America's children.  I disagree with her message, and I want
to tell you why.
<p>
The book's title comes from an African proverb, &quot;It takes
a village to raise a child.&quot;  An article about the book in
<I>Newsweek</I> magazine helps make the proverb's meaning perfectly
clear.  One of  Mrs. Clinton's favorite expressions, the article
says, is, &quot;There is no such thing as other people's children.&quot;
After reading just a few chapters of <I>It Takes a Village</I>,
it becomes obvious that what she means by &quot;village&quot;
is really <b>more</b> Big Government.  What she means by &quot;family
values&quot; is the mush that's left over after the time-honored
traditions of men and women of faith have been driven from the
public square.
<p>
I believe that our problem today is that too many parents are
looking to the so-called village to care for their children, instead
of meeting this precious responsibility themselves.  Many other
parents are struggling to meet this responsibility themselves,
but they are overwhelmed by crushing taxes, stagnating incomes,
the relentless encroachment on parental rights by government,
and the destruction of values by an amoral culture.  From Calvin
Klein ads to the studios of Hollywood, there is indeed a &quot;village&quot;
seeking to raise our children -- a Greenwich Village of sexual license
and crass materialism.  I don't want my children raised this way,
and I am confident you don't want it for your children or grandchildren
either.
<p>
Kay Coles James, a former Vice President at the Family Research
Council, knows this African proverb well.  Kay, a black American who was 
born in the slums of Portsmouth, Virginia, has risen to prominence
in our national political life.  She has written how Mrs. Clinton's
slogan has made the rounds and how deeply wrong it is:
<p><blockquote>
<i>It is really quite simple, we are told, if only we would cede parental 
control to the village, all would be well.  Children would no longer grow 
up insecure or worried; they would be well-adjusted, well-developed,
and full of healthy self-esteem.  What a wonderful world it would be .
. . .</i>
<p>
<i>But the village cannot raise a child.  Children don't belong to the 
community. Children belong to the parents who tuck them in at
night, wipe away their tears, feed them their meals, and answer their 
questions. If the past thirty years have taught us anything, it is that 
stable, intact, two-parent families are the foundation of a healthy 
village.</i>[1]
</blockquote><p>
Kay is right.  The village <b>cannot</b> raise a child.  Increasingly,
the &quot;village&quot; is taking our children away from us.  And as I told you 
last month, that is why I have written a new book of my own, <I>Our Hopes, 
Our Dreams:  A Vision for America</I>. Like Mrs. Clinton's, my book is about 
families and children -- but there the similarity ends.
<p>
In fact, it would be difficult to imagine two books more diametrically
opposed on the major issues facing our families and our nation.  Mrs. 
Clinton writes with admiration of Western Europe's &quot;openness about 
sexuality&quot;[2] and wishes we were similarly enlightened.  <I>Our Hopes, 
Our Dreams</I> ponders how our sex-saturated society can restore the virtues 
of fidelity and chastity. (I wonder if Mrs. Clinton has watched any cable t.v. 
lately or checked the tabloids as she walked through a grocery check-out lane?)
<I>It Takes a Village</I> deplores abortions <b>only</b> if they
are &quot;unsafe&quot;[3] and argues that the &quot;village&quot;
should promote contraception to young people to &quot;help them
deal responsibly with the consequences of their actions.&quot;[4]
My book questions the future for a nation that has abandoned
the sanctity of human life and lost the meaning of holy matrimony.
<p>
Hillary Clinton, <I>Newsweek</I> says, champions a government
&quot;program for every problem&quot;[5] and accuses conservatives
of opposing Big Government because we desire &quot;to advance
narrow religious, political and economic agendas.&quot;[6] My book
yearns for a rebirth of family and community that restores the
federal government to its limited constitutional role.  Mrs. Clinton
believes that &quot;everyone should wait until the age of 21 before
having sex.&quot;[7] Not only should sex be within the bonds of
marriage, but I believe that the virtue of an action does not
depend on one's age.
<p>
Hillary Clinton believes that out-of-home child care is controversial
because, she says, &quot;Americans have never sufficiently valued
the work of caring for children&quot; and have long been ambivalent
&quot;about whether surrogate child care is acceptable.&quot;[8]
<I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> argues, instead, that America's
families place the highest value on caring for children.  Families
have told pollsters time and again that they not only favor parental
care of children, but also want public policies that support that
choice.
<p>
The first lady's book is receiving tremendous attention in the
national liberal media.  She has also been interviewed by the
major news magazines.  The best-seller lists will no doubt track
her book's sales with enthusiasm.  As you know, however, those
lists completely ignore books like mine which come from Christian
publishers such as Focus on the Family.  The media will try to
ignore our pro-family message, too.  In some ways the outcome
of the family policy debate in 1996 will be determined by whether
more Americans support Hillary Clinton's message of Big Government
and liberal values or whether they accept and embrace the message
of renewal and faith contained in <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I>.
With your help, we can win this first &quot;debate&quot; of 1996
by making sure <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> reaches as many Americans
as possible.  I hope you will choose to read this pocket-size
paperback and then help distribute it to your friends, neighbors,
co-workers, sunday school class and anyone else interested in
America's future.
<p>
Hillary Clinton, however, is not the only public figure tossing
around adjectives like &quot;extreme&quot; these days.  If you've
watched the long-running budget battle between the Congress and the 
White House, you've heard some of the nastiest descriptions ever
applied to elected legislators by the sitting president and his
staff.  Specifically, they've described the congressional freshman
class as everything from &quot;the far right&quot; to &quot;inflexible
extremists.&quot;
<p>
Listening to the president, you would think that these first-term
legislators hate the elderly, intend to starve the poor, abandon
children, trash the environment, and close schoolhouse doors.
The budget deadlock that gripped this city was even blamed on
these newcomers.  Last  March, I wrote to you that these very
same members of Congress &quot;bring to Washington a spirit of
service that is truly rare.&quot;  In the aftermath of the recent
government shutdown, has my opinion changed?
<p>
Not at all!  If anything, I hold the congressional freshman class
in even higher regard now than I did a year ago.  The reason is simple: 
they have kept their word. The vast majority of these members came to 
Washington as citizen-legislators. That is, they did not see themselves 
as part of a permanent governing class. They supported term limits. They 
promised to rein in runaway government.  They promised to cut taxes
on families with children.  They pledged to balance the budget
and eliminate useless bureaucracies.
<p>
I have often prayed with these deeply faithful new members, and
I wince as I see them daily attacked in the liberal press.  The
media have been an echo chamber for the White House, unfairly
charging the freshmen with denying funds for everything from Meals
on Wheels to school lunch programs.  Medicare is the primary example.
Throughout the budget battle, Bill Clinton accused these men
and women of seeking &quot;to strip our government and our country&quot;[9]
of its rightful role.  Clinton huffed that the Congress has held
some 40+ hearings on the Whitewater scandal, but only one on the
Medicare bill he was asked to sign.
<p>
Actually, Congress held over 50 hearings on Medicare, but
Bill Clinton &quot;counted&quot; only the one hearing
held on the actual bill.  Where was our adversary press on this
one?  Furthermore, Medicare spending under the GOP seven-year
balanced budget plan will increase by 89%.  Per-person spending
will also increase from just over $4,800 per year now to over
$7,000 in the year 2002.  To keep Medicare from going bankrupt,
seniors would pay an additional $7 per month, an &quot;increase&quot;
that happens only because the GOP plan keeps the beneficiaries'
share of the premium right where it is now at 31.5%.  The President's
alternative was to shift more of the costs of the program to taxpayers
who do not receive any of the benefits.  Moreover, the House-backed
plan provided the elderly with a new freedom, medical savings
accounts, to help them take charge of their own coverage and avoid
the threat of rationing posed by the Clintons' health reform model.
<p>
Watching the president's January press conference, this thought
occurred to me, too.  He pointed out that he has halved the budget
deficit in three years.  That's true -- even if you believe, as I
do, that the administration's policies are not the primary cause
of the decline.   Much of the additional revenue necessary to
reduce the deficit came as a result of Clinton's tax increase,
$280 billion over five years[10], the largest in our nation's history!
My question is this:  If Bill Clinton could cut the deficit in
half in three years, how can it be &quot;extremist&quot; for congressmen
to advocate wiping out the <i>other</i> half of the deficit in
seven years?
<p>
Let me share with you just a few of the House conservatives'
other extraordinary accomplishments for the family:
<p><ul>
<li>Passed a $500 per child tax credit for all families with
dependent children under the age of 18.  Insisted on the full amount
of this credit in tough negotiations with the Senate, and held their
ground during the federal shutdown when Clinton vetoed the budget bill.
<p>
<li>Passed a $5,000 credit for adoption expenses to facilitate
the placement of children in permanent homes.
<p>
<li>Restored the ability of the states to deny taxpayer funds
for abortions; denied federal funds for human embryo research;
adopted language to deny foreign aid funds to agencies like International
Planned Parenthood that promote and perform abortion overseas;
protected the accreditation of teaching hospitals that refuse
to participate in abortion training; restored the ban on use of
taxpayer funds to subsidize abortions under federal employee health plans; 
reimposed limits, lifted in 1993 by President Clinton, on the performance of 
abortions in U.S. military hospitals; passed a ban on partial-birth abortions. 
The first four items have been bottled up in the Senate, but none of these 
actions would have been possible without the pro-life members added to the House 
in 1994.
<p>
<li>Passed the first major welfare reform in a generation, designed to curb 
illegitimacy, encourage work and discourage the formation of single-parent 
households headed by teenagers.
<p>
<li>Forced a sharp reduction in funding for the National Endowment
for the Arts, leading to its elimination in two years, thereby putting
out of business this elitist agency that has been unable to distinguish art
from obscenity.
</ul><p>
In the coming year, these members are likely to endure even more
media abuse as they strive to deliver on their promises to protect
religious liberty and parental rights.  Rep. Steve Largent's (R-Okla.) 
Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act and religious liberty protections 
championed by Reps. Ernest Istook (R-Okla.) and Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) will 
be FRC priorities in 1996.  These are just some of the many ideas
we advocate to ensure that when it comes to our children, Mom
and Dad are village chiefs!
<p>
In closing, let me thank you for the support you have provided
to FRC during the past year.  Your encouragement and financial
gifts will keep us fighting hard for the values we share.  <b>I
hope you'll take a moment to review the enclosed reply card and
that you will choose to help us distribute <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I>
to every American home.  Also, please ask your local Christian
Book Store to carry this important book.</b>
<p>
Sincerely,
<p><br>
Gary L. Bauer<br>
President
<p>
P.S.  I am thankful for your faithful friendship and support.
My family joins me in praying that God will richly bless you
and yours during this tumultuous time.

<title>How Much Is $1.6 Trillion - Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center><h3>HOW MUCH IS $1.6 TRILLION?</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/mason.htm">David Mason</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
April 25, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	With six kids and a single income, I am probably more aware than most where my paycheck goes. One thing I know for sure is that too much goes to government.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The federal government this year -- despite the much-ballyhooed "cuts" the Washington establishment has been bemoaning -- will spend some $1.6 trillion. The House of Representatives will begin debating spending targets for fiscal year 1997 during the first week of May. Make no mistake: Overall spending will go up, not down.  
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Even though I have worked in the nation's capital for more than a dozen years, eight of them on Capitol Hill, two at the Pentagon, and six at The Heritage Foundation, where we routinely analyze programs costing tens of billions of dollars, I don't have the faintest idea how much $1.6 trillion really is. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	For most of us, even a million is incomprehensible. Have you ever tried to count to a million? Think about it: If you counted non-stop without eating or sleeping it would take approximately 23 days to count to a million. To count to a billion literally would take a lifetime: 95 years. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Counting to a trillion, assuming we get started right away and don't waste any time, would take about 2,000 centuries -- 200,000 years.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Most of us can at least imagine counting for 23 days. A period of 2,000 centuries, on the other hand, is beyond human understanding. As is a trillion dollars.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Of course, government doesn't just count money, it spends it -- and it does so at a phenomenal rate: $4.5 billion a day. Enough to support my family and quite a few others for a very long time.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A lot of the money government spends is borrowed, more than half-a-million dollars per minute, $32 million an hour, or $768 million a day. This borrowed money gets added to the national debt.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Despite two very costly world wars, it took from the beginning of the American Republic until 1982 -- more than 200 years -- to amass the first $1 trillion in debt. By February 1996, however, the debt exceeded $5 trillion. On April 19, when I last checked, the "national debt clock" on the Internet stood at $5,147,684,202,607.46. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	That's five trillion, 147 billion, 684 million, 202 thousand, 607 dollars and 46 cents: More than $19,450 for every man, woman and child in the United States, a whopping $155,000 for the Mason family -- enough to purchase a new house and pay a year's worth of college tuition, with money left over.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The story doesn't end here, however. Unless something drastic happens, government spending and borrowing will get worse. Under the current budget, annual government spending will increase to $2 trillion by the year 2002 -- just six years down the road. The debt also will increase: by approximately $150 billion per year.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Moreover, this spending spree is now largely on autopilot. The cost of mandatory "entitlement" programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, already the largest portion of the budget, will increase 63 percent by the year 2002, while interest payments on the national debt will increase 16 percent. The remainder of the budget, meanwhile --  for national defense, law enforcement, environmental cleanup, maintenance of U.S. ports and parks and everything else -- will grow a relatively modest 14 percent.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unchecked, this crowding-out effect would reach its destructive conclusion in 2010 -- the year my seven-year-old reaches the age of 21 -- when entitlement spending and interest on the national debt will consume 100 percent of the federal budget.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The next time somebody says government spending needs to be brought under control you'll know why. If you forget, just start counting. I'm sure you'll remember long before you reach 5 trillion, 147 billion.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<title>How Republicans Can Win the Environmental Debate - Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>HOW REPUBLICANS CAN WIN THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEBATE</h3>
By John Shanahan<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
April 25, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Earth Day (April 22) was painful for Republicans. Unless they develop a new strategy on the environment, they will continue getting "gored" on the issue. Not because they failed to communicate their vision, but because they don't have one.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton administration sent its troops to the congressional districts of vulnerable Republican freshman in Congress to blast them on their environmental record. "Green" activists similarly conducted a media blitz attacking the "anti-environment" GOP.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Liberals have been successful at portraying the new Republican Congress as "planet pavers" who want to "roll back" environmental protection laws, all to satisfy polluting industrialists who contributed to the GOP's political coffers.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Republicans, meanwhile, have been waging the environmental debate almost exclusively with  regulatory "horror stories"-- tales of real Americans suffering under oppressive environmental laws.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	These anecdotes work, but only to a point.  For example, most Americans would react with anger to the story of Earl Miller, my own dry cleaner in Arlington, Va., who lost his family business after 30 years because he could not afford a new (and largely unnecessary) $40,000 machine required by the Environmental Protection Agency.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But Republicans have relied too heavily on such stories. As much as Americans  want the government to stop harassing people, they fear (understandably) that if the "regulatory safety net" disappears, we would return to the days of billowing black smokestacks and burning rivers. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This is why the Republican message so far -- that we need to balance environmental protection with the demands of economic growth -- has fallen like a lead balloon. Many people are convinced the argument is just shorthand for rolling back environmental protections.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Even though environmental regulations cost the U.S. economy an incredible $171 billion annually, balancing this cost against a child's life is a losing proposition. Unless  Republicans can show that their policies protect jobs, eliminate unfairness, and do a better job protecting the environment and public health than the big-government approach, environmental issues will continue to be their Achilles' heel.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The fact is, well intentioned liberal environmental policies can kill. For example, according to a Harvard University study, current regulatory policies cost 60,000 lives per year. Why? Because the government squanders huge sums of money guarding against minuscule risks -- the theoretical loss of life due to trace amounts of chemicals on fruits and vegetables, for example -- while it ignores much greater risks. Dr. John Graham of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis calls this "statistical murder." 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Superfund and property rights reforms before Congress provide excellent opportunities to improve the environment and save more lives. Under the hazardous waste "Superfund" cleanup program, created in 1980, only about 20 percent of the 1,374 sites on the list have been cleaned up. Lawmakers should let people know they want to accelerate cleanups that are now delayed because trial lawyers -- big allies of the White House -- soak up 21 percent of Superfund's money. More lives would be saved because of faster cleanups of the worst sites posing the most risk to Americans.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Similarly, Republicans should explain that protecting the rights of property owners can actually benefit threatened species. Right now, under the Endangered Species Act, regulators can financially ruin families by taking away their ability to use their land, without compensation. This is unfair and counterproductive. It creates an incentive for property owners to make sure no one finds out about endangered species that may live on their land. The bumper sticker "shoot, shovel, and shut up" tells the whole story.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Republicans must recognize that the American people legitimately expect freedom from harmful pollution. That doesn't mean they should embrace the  environmentalist agenda, which opposes letting businesses find the best way to comply with environmental safeguards, and is hostile to free-market solutions. It does mean, however, that they must publicly acknowledge that polluting a neighborhood is not a conservative value. They should stress the need to prioritize risks and explain why market approaches often work better than regulations -- not only for preserving liberty and economic growth, but for the environment as well. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Most people want more freedom, a stronger economy and a clean and healthy environment. Republicans can win the environmental debate if they meet this challenge, and give people all three. With a positive vision, they can do just that.

<title>Gary Bauer's October, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

October 16, 1996

<p>

Dear Friend,

<p>

<i>Last month, just before the Congress adjourned, the Senate held its 
historic debate on partial-birth abortion.  At the end of an incredible 
day on Capitol Hill, I sat down at 1:00 o'clock in the morning to write 
you this "eyewitness account"</i>:

<p>

It's nearly 1:00 o'clock in the morning as I write this month's letter to 
you. I have just finished an unbelievable 20-hour day in which my emotions 
have run the gamut from exhilaration to deep despair.  The focus of 
today's events was the vote in the United States Senate to overturn 
President Clinton's veto of the partial-birth abortion bill. We lost that 
vote, but in the process we may have taken a giant step toward stopping the 
ongoing tragedy of abortion on demand.  Let me share with you a few excerpts 
from the roller coaster ride I was on today as we spoke the truth about the 
sanctity of human life to the powerful elites here in Washington, D.C.

<p>

My day began on the <i>CBS Morning News</i>, where I debated Kate Michelman 
of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League.  As is 
usually the case, the morning talk shows only give us four or five minutes 
to present our views on an issue -- this morning was no exception.  I knew 
I had to have my arguments down pat, for there is little time to hesitate 
or reflect when you're sitting in a TV studio under a bank of hot 
lights.  I also knew a sharp debater like Michelman would be sure to 
quickly fill any time I didn't use.

<p>

I often feel frustrated after such a debate because I don't usually get 
enough time to fully express my views or because I don't think of the 
best way to articulate some arguments until the debate is over.  But 
this morning was a "home run."  The CBS anchorwoman was fair, and she 
gave me equal time.  I was able to establish for the millions of people 
watching that partial-birth abortions <i>do</i> occur thousands of times a 
year -- most of them for purely elective reasons rather than because of 
health problems of the mother or her baby.  Kate Michelman presented few 
relevant arguments and seemed unusually low-key.  It had to be tough for 
her to defend the position that it could ever be okay to abort a baby in the 
eighth or ninth month of pregnancy by stabbing it in the back of the head.

<p>

But there was no time to relish the debate victory. I was immediately 
rushed from the CBS studio to attend an extraordinary prayer breakfast 
on Capitol Hill.  Pro-life senators led by Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania 
hosted the gathering to pray that senators' hearts would be touched 
before they voted.  The solemn gathering in that small room included 
some of the real "stars" of the pro-family/pro-life movement -- proven 
crusaders like Chuck Colson and my good friend and colleague Jim Dobson 
of Focus on the Family. We took turns asking God for His wisdom and 
strength for the tough hours of lobbying ahead.  More importantly, we 
prayed that God would have mercy on our country as it slips further 
and further into the culture of death.

<p>

A few minutes after breakfast, the ecumenical group gathered again -- 
this time in the office of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.  There 
we participated in a press conference on the upcoming vote.  Fourteen 
pro-life leaders made individual statements before a bank of TV cameras 
and a forest of microphones.  The room was jammed from one wall to the 
other, and the hot TV lights glared down on us all.  We were expecting 
the usual hostility of the liberal Washington media.  But again, 
strangely, there were no real arguments -- no hardball questions. Only 
one reporter even asked a question, and I was given the opportunity to 
answer.  He asked whether I was satisfied with the attention Bob Dole 
had paid to the issue. My response was clear: I told the reporter 
that Bob Dole was not responsible for partial-birth abortions.  I said 
we were here because Bill Clinton had vetoed a bill passed overwhelmingly 
by the Congress to stop these horrible procedures.  I then urged Senator 
Dole in the remaining days of the campaign to emphasize the issue and to 
draw the stark comparison between himself and his opponent so the 
American people could clearly understand their choice.

<p>

After the press conference, we all fanned out on Capitol Hill to buttonhole 
lawmakers.  We met Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania as he got off the 
Capitol subway, and, even though he is usually pro-abortion, we ultimately 
won his vote. A few minutes later, we encountered Senator Joe Biden of 
Delaware, and he ended up voting with us too.  Unfortunately, other senators 
were harder to convince.  Senator Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas refused to hear 
us out when we appealed to her in the Senate dining room.  She said she 
didn't even think the Senate should be discussing the issue.  My good 
friend Kay James, who is a black American, told Mrs. Kassebaum that she was 
glad that her attitude didn't prevail in our country when slavery was 
being debated over 100 years ago!

<p>

As we walked the halls of the Capitol, the abortion debate was raging on 
the floor of the Senate.  Good friends, senators like Dan Coats of Indiana, 
John Ashcroft of Missouri and Don Nickles of Oklahoma, led the floor debate 
while a hushed gallery of visitors looked on.  The pro-abortion side was 
led by Barbara Boxer of California.

<p>

We sat in the Senate gallery together to watch the proceedings -- myself, 
Dr. Dobson, Kay, Beverly LaHaye of Concerned Women for America, Anthony 
Cardinal Bevilacqua of Philadelphia, Rabbi Daniel Lapin and a dozen other 
allies.  As I looked around, I couldn't help but wonder what was going on 
in the minds of tourists from all over America who had brought their 
children there with them.  They seemed subdued, almost shocked, as they 
heard senators describe this terrible procedure.  At one emotional moment, 
one pro-life senator pointed to a picture of a baby and shouted in 
exasperation, "This is not an appendix; this is not a lump of tissue; this 
is a baby!"  Here's what happened next as reported by <i>The Washington 
Post</i>:

<p><blockquote>

<i>And then, impossibly, in an already hushed gallery, in one of 
those moments when the floor of the Senate looks like a stage set, with its 
rich wooden desks somehow too small for the matters at hand, the cry of a 
baby pierced the room, echoing across the chamber from an outside hallway.

<p>

No one mentioned the cry, but for a few seconds no one spoke at all.</i>

</blockquote><p>

No one knows whose baby it was that brought the Senate to silence that day, 
but I can't help but believe that God chose that moment for this child to 
cry and, by so doing, to remind the Senate that "choice" in this case means 
the death of <b>real</b> human beings.

<p>

Soon the voting began.  As I am sure you know by now, our efforts helped 
win a clear majority, but we still fell short of the 66 votes needed to 
overturn Clinton's veto.  It was a tragic day, but even in the midst of 
our disappointment and heartbreak, there were some encouraging developments. 
I am convinced that something is stirring among God's people.  The 
cooperation of a large number of religious leaders from different 
denominations and from all parts of the country was unprecedented.  I'm 
convinced, too, that a new level of coalition building has been achieved 
and that the groundwork has been laid for better communication and 
cooperation in the future.

<p>

As the day wore on, my message was the same in every press interview. I 
told reporter after reporter that America is better than the vote that just 
took place.  I also told them that our nation was founded as a "shining 
city on a hill", that we are a unique experiment in liberty under God 
with rights and responsibilities that come only from Him. And this vote 
to allow the outright killing of nearly-born children through the promotion 
of abortion-on-demand sticks in our throats.  It will never go down easy 
with Americans because it violates every tenet of our founding.  Our 
conscience will not rest easy as long as we continue to allow the sacrifice 
of these children.

<p>

More than ever, I believe our beloved nation is at a crossroads, with the 
question Lincoln posed at Gettysburg still before us. As he stood on 
hallowed ground, he said we were conceived in liberty and asked whether 
"this nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure?"

<p>

This is the great question facing our nation as we go into the next century. 
How we resolve the issues of life, family and marriage will determine whether 
America during the next century can still be that "shining city on a hill".

<p>

Even though the hour is late for our country, we must never cease our efforts 
to protect our spiritual heritage.  As God told Solomon, "if my people, who 
are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and 
turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and will forgive 
their sin and will heal their land." (II Chronicles 7:14 NIV) We must 
redouble our prayers seeking God's mercy as the elites of our nation look 
farther away from Him. I want you to know that my staff and I are committed 
to do everything in our power to defend the values that have made our 
country great.

<p>

The Family Research Council is here to represent and serve you.  But I have 
to be honest. In recent weeks we haven't been hearing from enough of you. 
We need your encouragement, and your prayers, and we need to know if you 
stand with us in the battle for family, faith and freedom.  We also pray 
that, if you are able, you will choose to help FRC financially, <b>after</b> 
you have met the needs of your family and your church.

<p>

In closing, it's my prayer that God will richly bless you and your family. 
I look forward to hearing from you soon.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S. FRC is preparing a special analysis of the upcoming elections 
focusing on how the results will impact you and your family.  To receive

you and may God bless America.

<title>Really Stand for Children: Fix Welfare -- Heritage</title>

<h3>
REALLY STAND FOR CHILDREN: FIX WELFARE</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm">Robert Rector</a><br>
Senior Analyst for Welfare and Family Issues <br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
June 6, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Recently, the nation's capitol was the  scene of  the "Stand for Children" rally organized by the liberal Children's Defense Fund. The rally's proclaimed goal was to call attention to the plight of the nation's children; its unstated goal was to defend the continuing growth of the welfare system and to criticize those in Congress who have sought reform. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	While the rally was correct to call attention to the plight of many of  America's children, the irony is that children are suffering because of the governmental policies supported by the rally's organizers. Children are suffering because the liberal welfare state has carpet-bombed the moral foundations of  the inner city, toppling marriage, gutting the work ethic, and leaving a rubble of social pathology in its wake.  
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The failure of the War on Poverty stems from its flawed premise: a core belief  that "material poverty" is critically harmful to children. According to this view, welfare, by reducing material poverty, can  increase children's well-being and lifetime attainment.  Similarly, since poverty "causes" such problems as crime, school failure, low cognitive ability, illegitimacy, an eroded work ethic, and drug use -- greater welfare spending can readily reduce poverty and most social problems at the same time. From this simplistic logic has sprung a relentless 30-year effort to raise welfare benefits, expand welfare eligibility, create new welfare programs, and increase welfare spending. The "Stand for Children" rally repeated this tired theme.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But history refutes this naive belief in welfare. In 1950, nearly a third of the U.S. population was poor (twice the current rate). In the 1920s, roughly half of the population was poor by today's standard. If it were true that "material poverty" causes social problems, we should have had far more social problems in those earlier periods than we do today. On the contrary: Crime, family breakup and most other social problems were nowhere near the levels they are today.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	History and common sense both show that values and abilities within families -- not family income -- are what determine children's achievement. Successful families tend to have sound values concerning self-control, deferred gratification, work, education and marriage, which they pass on to their children. Attempting to raise family income artificially through welfare does little to benefit a child, but does a lot to destroy the very values that are key to a child's success.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The point many liberals refuse to recognize is that welfare has behavioral side effects. It engenders dependence and illegitimacy, both highly injurious to children's development. For example, among the nearly 5 million families currently receiving AFDC benefits, the total time spent on welfare will average nearly 13 years. A 1994 report by June O'Neill, currently Congressional Budget Office director, shows that increasing the length of time a child spends on welfare may reduce the child's IQ by as much as 20 percent. O'Neill makes clear that welfare dependence, rather than poverty, is what truly hurts children. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
          	By paying women more money when they have children out of wedlock, welfare also plays a powerful role in promoting illegitimacy, a fact acknowledged by President Clinton but ignored by the "Stand for Children" organizers. Being born outside of marriage and raised in a single-parent home triples the level of behavioral and emotional problems among children; nearly triples the level of teen sexual activity; doubles the probability a young woman will have children out of wedlock; and doubles the probability a boy will engage in criminal activity and wind up in jail. 	
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We can't help America's children by continuing past mistaken policies. The current welfare system must be replaced; the automatic and rapid growth of welfare spending must be curtailed. In the future, welfare no longer should be a one-way hand out; adult recipients should be required to work for the benefits they receive. And steps must be taken to reduce future illegitimacy, beginning with restricting cash welfare to unmarried teen moms. 
 <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We must begin to focus on institutions with a record of success, not failure.  Religious institutions have been dramatically successful in reducing teen sexual activity, crime, drug use, and other problems among young people. One way to give the poor access to this fountain of hope would be to give poor parents education vouchers they could  freely use to send their children to private schools, including religious schools. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But Americans should remember that well-meaning, big-government liberals who call welfare reformers "anti-child" are the unwitting advocates of precisely what is hurting America's children: welfare.<p>

<h3>LABOR PAINS</h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/wilson.htm">Mark Wilson</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
August 22, 1996</center>
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	This Labor Day the country will kick back, fire up the barbecue, and take a moment to celebrate the accomplishments of America's working men and women. But will those workers themselves have anything to celebrate?

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The answer is, sadly, not much. Despite a seemingly rosy employment picture -- more than 11 million new jobs since 1991 and an unemployment rate down to 5.4 percent -- the real outlook for U.S. workers remains rather grim. Scratch below the surface of these numbers, and the much-discussed economic anxiety felt by America's workers becomes perfectly understandable.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For starters, job layoffs are continuing at a blistering pace. In the first six months of 1996, 271,000 Americans lost their jobs, the second-highest number this decade. Layoffs were 28 percent higher than during the first six months of 1995, and 6 percent higher than in 1993, the largest "downsizing" year of the decade.  So far this year, thousands of jobs have vanished in important industries such as telecommunications (43,000), computers (22,000), and automobiles (18,000). 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What's more, even those workers able to find new jobs are taking it on the chin: Weekly earnings in their new positions are averaging 8.2 percent less than in their old jobs. For workers aged 45 to 55 -- those with home mortgages and kids in college to support -- the pay cuts are averaging an even higher 14 percent. And to add insult to injury, nearly one of every five displaced workers lands in a new job that doesn't even offer health-insurance coverage.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But even these folks are better off than the large number of workers who can't find new jobs at all. The fact is, the long-term unemployment rate -- which measures the number of jobless Americans out of work for six months or more -- remains at a stubbornly high 18.5 percent. Compare this with the average of 10.3 percent during the three previous U.S. economic expansions.  Even out-of-work white-collar managers and other professionals have been having a rough time; nearly one in five is still unemployed after six months of searching.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What about those workers lucky enough to hold onto their jobs? Here, too, the news is less than upbeat. Adjusted for inflation, full-time workers' paychecks haven't increased for five years. For men, real weekly earnings have actually dropped by 5.1 percent, and for black and Hispanic men the drop has been even worse, 5.4 percent and 8.2 percent respectively.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The decline in weekly earnings can be partly explained by the disappearance of high-paying manufacturing jobs. Since March of 1995, the economy has shed more than 280,000 such jobs. In fact, fewer manufacturing jobs exist today than when the economic recovery began five years ago. In addition, the number of Americans working in high-skilled technician and related jobs has dropped by 478,000 since 1992, the number working in administrative support and clerical positions has fallen by 298,000, and the number working in precision production, craft and repair occupations has declined by 13,000 (and remains 519,000 below the peak of 14 million reached in March of 1990). 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What all this adds up to, predictably, is anxiety on the part of the American worker. Nearly 50 percent of Americans believe jobs are not very plentiful, according to the Conference Board's most recent survey of consumer confidence, and 46 percent believe the economy is getting worse, according to a recent CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Let's face it: For many American workers President Clinton's declaration that the economy is "the healthiest it has been in 30 years" rings hollow. They seem to understand instinctively what many economists have been saying -- that the Clinton economy's growth rate of slightly more than 2 percent a year is not sufficient to produce a large number of good, stable, high-paying jobs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The fact is, the economy can grow much faster than it has these past four years. We experienced growth rates of 3.5 percent for most of the 1980s, and the economy produced 19 million new jobs. But that was during a period of lower taxation and fewer regulations on business.  In the current era of high taxes and heavy regulation, 2 percent growth and sluggish job creation may be the best we can hope for.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	And that's nothing to celebrate.

<h3>RAISING THE BAR</h3>
By Nina Shokraii<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
February 29, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the debate over affirmative action about to begin in Congress, opponents of racial quotas and preferences should be ready to offer a better way of creating opportunity for racial groups that have been victims of discrimination.  The answer is high academic standards for everyone.
<p> 
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The greatest tragedy of public education today is the low expectations it sets for poor children, especially blacks and Hispanics.  Racial quotas and preferences reinforce this defeatism by sending a message that blacks and Hispanics can succeed academically and economically only if they are held to a lower standard than Asians and whites.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But the experience of countless schools and teachers shows that when there are high expectations, black and Hispanic children can meet them.  Test scores for racial minorities can rise by quantum jumps without the ugly practice of "race-norming," where test scores are artificially raised to compensate for racial status.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Take, for instance, the experience of Rafe Esquith, a fifth- and sixth-grade teacher at Hobart Elementary School, located near the site of the 1992 riots in Los Angeles.  Most children at Hobart are poor immigrants from families that don't speak English; 80 percent are Hispanic, 16 percent Asian, 2 percent African-American.  But by the end of the sixth grade, Esquith's students have finished a year of algebra and classical literature -- including eight Shakespeare plays.  His junior thespian crew, the "Hobart Shakespeareans," have performed with Britain's Royal Shakespeare Company.  Their performance of "Measure for Measure" will open the World Shakespeare Congress in Los Angeles this June.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;How does Esquith bring out the best in his class?  The same way outstanding teachers always do.  He sets high standards and gives his students the help they need to meet them.  Esquith begins teaching his class at 6:30 a.m. and teaches straight until 5 p.m. (They even eat lunch in the classroom.)  By teaching his youngsters to solve difficult math equations and to read and perform Shakespeare early on, Esquith trains his kids to take on challenges that at first seem impossible.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The result: Last year, in the mathematics portion of the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills (a test administered to the Los Angeles Unified School District), his fifth-graders achieved average scores in the 98th percentile while the school itself scored in the 64th percentile and the district in the 47th percentile.  On the English test, they produced similar results -- even though all of Esquith's students speak English as a second language. If not for his devotion, most would be written off as "slow" or "troubled."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;No one can attest to the success of a teacher like Rafe Esquith better than Barbara Lerner. A lawyer and psychologist, she was an outspoken advocate of the "minimum competence testing" movement in the late 1970s -- a grassroots movement demanding that no student be allowed to graduate from high school without first passing a test proving he or she had mastered basic skills in reading and math.  Lerner's 1983 testimony in <I>Debra vs. Turlington</I> (the case challenging Florida's minimum competence test) convinced the courts that minimum competence testing provided just the push these kids needed, pointing out that by the fifth attempt, more than 90 percent of them passed.  Lerner believes schools should make the minimum competence exam the standard for grade-school graduation and also should require children to pass an advanced competence test like the Scholastic Aptitude Test to graduate from high school.  
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But lawsuits and policies challenging advanced competency abound, and efforts to make earning a high-school diploma contingent upon passing a stringent exam bear a heavy political risk -- because, at first, many students are likely to fail the tests.  According to a 1995 report by the North Central Regional Education Laboratory, only 17 states require all their high school students to pass some form of graduation test.  And of these 17 states, only New York  has made significant strides. Thanks to Ramon Cortines, former chancellor of New York City's public schools, standards and accountability were reinstalled as the centerpiece of education in New York City.  Although the results of the first year reveal a rise in course-failure rates among African-Americans and Hispanics, the number of minorities taking and passing the more rigorous courses increased greatly.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Opponents of affirmative action present myriad empowerment ideas, such as school-choice vouchers, when challenged to offer alternatives. But as the experiences of teachers like Esquith demonstrate, promoting high standards has proven to boost achievement in a way affirmative action never has and never will.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The best kind of affirmative action is that which will teach children the discipline they need to advance in the educational and professional arena.

<title>The Truth About Free Trade and Protectionism - Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center><h3>THE TRUTH ABOUT FREE TRADE AND PROTECTIONISM</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/johnson.htm">Bryan T. Johnson</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
April 25, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	There's a notion afoot that free trade is hurting the U.S. worker, that it is causing corporations to downsize and lay off their employees, and that the answer is for the U.S. government to impose economic sanctions against foreign countries like Japan. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In reality, this would be very unwise. History and economic common sense show that the "trade wars" approach to the world marketplace simply doesn't work. Consider the following myths: 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	<b>Myth #1</b>: Free trade has allowed manufacturers to go overseas to obtain cheap labor, destroying America's manufacturing infrastructure and losing American jobs. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Reality</b>: If U.S. manufacturing companies were moving overseas in droves, manufacturing as a percentage of the total U.S. economy would have suffered a steep decline. Instead, it has maintained a constant level of about 21 percent of the total economy for three decades. And if cheap labor were the big draw people like Pat Buchanan and H. Ross Perot say it is, U.S. companies would be invested up to their eyeballs in countries like Haiti, Somalia and the Dominican Republic. Obviously they're not, or these countries wouldn't be destitute. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Myth #2</b>: We must protect high-paying manufacturing jobs from foreign competition.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Reality</b>: Not if such protection costs an even greater number of jobs in other industries and causes consumer prices to rise. Consider for example, U.S. import quotas on automobiles, which caused the price of new American autos to increase by 41 percent from 1981 to 1984. The auto industry claims these price hikes saved up to 22,000 jobs. But they also reduced sales -- by about 1 million cars. This drop forced some 50,000 layoffs by the late 1980s. In other words, even though protectionism saved some 22,000 jobs, it caused a net job loss of 30,000.  Some "protection."
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Myth #3</b>: Free trade is causing America to lose its technological edge.  
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Reality</b>: America by far is the world's leader in technological innovation and is the world's largest manufacturer of computer microprocessors, semiconductors, advanced consumer electronics, health equipment, telecommunications equipment, computers and computer software, and host of other information technologies and high-tech products. Over time, competition from other nations like Japan is making us do better, not worse.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Myth #4</b>: U.S. trade deficits -- especially with Japan -- mean America is becoming poorer while others become richer.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Reality</b>: If this were true, the United States wouldn't be the economic powerhouse it is today. The real reason the United States has a trade deficit with Japan is because there are twice as many Americans as there are Japanese. In order for America to have a trade "balance" with Japan, each and every Japanese would need to buy twice as much from America as Americans buy from Japan.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Myth #5</b>: Trade deficits cost jobs.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Reality</b>: History shows that as the U.S. trade deficit increases, unemployment actually decreases. For example, as the U.S. trade deficit leaped in 1983-84 and peaked in 1987, the U.S. unemployment rate plummeted. Conversely, when the trade deficit shrank, from 1989 to 1991, unemployment began to increase. The reason some major companies lay off large numbers of workers has nothing to do with trade deficits and everything to do with burdensome regulatory policies here at home.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #6</b>: U.S. companies will go under unless the government limits competition from foreign imports and forces foreign governments to purchase more U.S. goods. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Reality</b>: U.S. companies who use this scare tactic to stampede lawmakers into passing protectionist policies are trying to protect themselves from competition, both foreign and domestic. If American companies are so beset by closed markets overseas, why is America the world's largest exporter? The U.S. auto industry -- so beat up by the Japanese years ago -- is now winning. It racked up $14 billion in profits last year and is making cars that are better built, have fewer flaws and are bigger sellers than many of their Japanese and European counterparts. They have free trade to thank, not government meddling. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In short, while it may be tempting to blame other countries when U.S. companies downsize or lay off  workers, there is no evidence that free trade is hurting us, or that "trade wars" are the answer. Rather, it shows that free trade is the road to prosperity.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<title>Gary Bauer's August, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

August 13, 1996

<p><br><br>

<ul><ul>

<i>He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might
he giveth strength. Even the youths shall faint, and be weary; and 
the young men shall utterly fall. But they that wait upon the Lord 
shall renew their strength; they shall mount with wings as eagles; 
they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not 
faint.</i>

</ul></ul>

<p><center>

<i>- Isaiah 40:29-31</i>

</center><p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

While watching the Olympic games last month, I couldn't help
but recall these poignant words from the prophet Isaiah.  These
verses play a pivotal role in the classic film <I>Chariots of
Fire,</I> the true story of Scottsman, Eric Liddell, an Olympic
runner.  Liddell recites this passage from Scripture at a church
service held on a day he was supposed to run a race in the Paris
Games. <I>Chariots of Fire</I> tells how Liddell, a dedicated
Christian, refused to run on the Sabbath, standing by his personal
conviction in the face of intense pressure from the future King
of England and others.

<p>

Even though my athletic ability won't get me into the Olympics,
I must tell you that these hectic summer months have all of us
at Family Research Council (FRC) running hard.  Time and again,
we are led back to God's promise that He will renew our strength,
that he will enable us to effectively run the race and that His
strength will never fail.  FRC's staff has truly been pressed
to the limit in recent days, and just like Olympic athletes, we
have experienced the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
Let me share with you, some of the many hills and hurdles FRC
has encountered.

<p>

This month, the major events requiring our attention are the
conventions of national political parties.  The Republicans met
first in San Diego, followed by the National Taxpayer's Party,
Ross Perot's Reform Party, and finally the Democrats.  The Libertarian
Party has already nominated its presidential candidate.  As a
non-partisan organization, FRC continues to focus its energies
on providing each of these parties with a detailed agenda for
families. As I reported to you last month, FRC has advocated
the pro-family agenda in a wide variety of public forums and we
will continue to do so regardless of  the response we receive
from party leaders and the media elite.

<p>

As you read this, chances are I'll be returning to Washington
after having taken the pro-family message to the GOP Convention
in San Diego.  We have urged each of the nation's political parties
to make America's families a priority.  We want Democrats, Republicans,
and the smaller &quot;third parties&quot; alike, to see &quot;family&quot;
<b><i>not</i></b> in terms of election cycles, but in terms of daily
responsibilities and everyday needs.  We have urged them all to
adopt platforms that strengthen marriage, recognize the sanctity
of human life, cut taxes for families, and to pay increased attention
to the cultural decay undermining our society.

<p>

In San Diego, I addressed a rally at Sea World designed to urge
the GOP to uphold its commitment to the sanctity of life, to lower
taxes on families and to work for economic opportunitiy and growth.
I made our case to convention delegates and to the national media,
who always crowd these events.  In the weeks before the conventions,
my schedule was crammed with appearances on network and cable
talk shows to discuss the issues at stake during this election
year.  Incredibly, FRC was cited more than 1,500 times in the
print media nationwide in June.  Needless to say,  FRC Press Secretary,
Kristi Hamrick and her quality staff are incredibly busy.

<p>

For my part, there was CNN's &quot;Inside Politics&quot; to discuss
the GOP platform plank on abortion, an appearance on &quot;Crossfire&quot;
with former Gov. Carroll Campbell to discuss the presidential
campaign, another visit to the weekly commentary show, &quot;The
Capital Gang,&quot; an interview with Ollie North on his daily
radio show and numerous other media opportunities.

<p>

Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, FRC has provided in-depth research
and related resource materials to lawmakers who are concerned
about the attack on traditional marriage. Our recent full page ad in
<I>USA Today</I>, which I described in my June letter, was just 
the opening move in our effort to inform citizens
about the potential impact of an expected court decision in Hawaii.
This decision would recognize same-sex marriages and potentially
impose similar recognition on other states.

<p>

To most Americans, I suspect, the reason that one man/one woman
marriage is so vital to the survival of our society almost goes
without saying.  But in these times, people need regular, convincing
reminders about the fundamentals.  That's why FRC recently hosted
a briefing on Capitol Hill, which gathered together a group of
distinguished scholars, physicians, and public policy experts
to discuss the far reaching implications of  &quot;same sex&quot;
marriage.  The briefing was carried live on C-Span, and was re-aired
several times during the next 24 hours.  As a result, millions
of Americans had the opportunity to join with legislators and
congressional aides to see and hear the powerful testimony that
was presented.

<p>

The arguments against homosexual marriage are convincing and
familiar -- so familiar, in fact, that many of us have forgotten
how to effectively articulate them.  FRC's briefing brought together
people like adoption expert Mary Beth Style, former homosexual
Anthony Falzarano (who now leads Transformation Ex-Gay Ministries
in Washington, D.C.), Amherst Professor of Jurisprudence Hadley
Arkes, psychiatrist and former Yale University Fellow, Jeffrey
Satinover, and FRC's own Bob Knight, each of whom drove home the
essential values that are at stake in this debate. <i>(To help
you understand and articulate the arguments, FRC has condensed
this briefing into an hour-long video -- see the enclosed
reply card for information on how to obtain a copy for your church
or action group.)</i>

<p>

One week after the briefing, I found myself in the thick
of things again as I testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee
in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA).  Disappointingly,
most of the senators who attended are very liberal and they are
also in favor of allowing same-sex marriages.  Before I testified,
Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.), a primary opponent of DOMA, used the
hearing to attack the bill.  His central point was that marriage
laws traditionally have been made by the states, and that DOMA
would violate the principle of &quot;federalism,&quot; which says
that Congress will not interfere with the powers of state government.
Unbelievable! Ted Kennedy, quoting &quot;states rights,&quot;
while he has been the major proponent of bigger and bigger government
here in Washington. Maybe cows really can fly!

<p>

Kennedy left before I testified, but as I was finishing my remarks
he returned to the hearing room, so I couldn't resist a jab.
&quot;Senator Kennedy,&quot; I said, &quot;this is the first
time in your career you've made such an outstanding defense of
federalism.&quot;  The usually somber hearing room broke into
raucous laughter, and the liberal senator from Massachusetts sank
back into his chair speechless.  The irony is, DOMA makes a powerful
statement in support of the right of each state to ignore the
radical judicial inventions of other states.  It's true federalism
all the way.

<p>

On the day after my testimony, the full House of Representatives
voted for DOMA 342-67.  This 5-1 margin of victory makes it clear
that DOMA <b><i>is</i></b> mainstream and that the aggressive ambitions
of the homosexual lobby <b><i>are not</i></b>.  In the coming days, FRC
will continue scrambling to help ensure that DOMA passes the Congress
without amendments and goes to the president for signature.  We
intend to do everything we can to send the Hawaii courts -- and liberal
judges everywhere -- a powerful message.

<p>

Here are several other fronts on which FRC has been fighting
for America's families:

<p><ul>

<li>FRC Director of Legal Policy, Cathleen Cleaver, has been in
the thick of the raging debates over computer pornography, cable
porn, and social issues from assisted suicide to religious liberty.
Cathleen played a key role in the recent adoption of the Communications
Decency Act, a bill passed by Congress earlier this year that
will help keep distributors of computer porn away from our children.
A federal court in Philadelphia struck down this law, but Cathleen
has begun work on FRC's legal brief to the Supreme Court, which
is likely to hear the case this fall.

<p>

FRC is also fighting for the right of citizens to offer sidewalk
counseling to women seeking abortions.  Cathleen prepared a brief
to the Supreme Court in the <I>Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network</I>
case and she is working with other lawyers to prepare oral arguments
to be made before the Court. Two major assisted suicide cases
are also getting our attention.  Either one could lead to a landmark
Supreme Court ruling which would protect human life, or put millions
of elderly and handicapped Americans at risk.

<p>

Finally, Cathleen is taking her effective debating skills before
some very tough audiences, and more than holding her own.  This
summer she has debated cable porn with Elliott Mincberg of People
for the American Way. She also locked horns over computer porn
with the government relations director of America On-line (a
longtime lawyer for the porn industry.) The computer porn debate
was shown on C-Span to a national audience.

<p>

<li>Robert Maginnis, FRC Policy Analyst has continued to spearhead
our Military Readiness Project. Bob came to FRC from the U.S. Army,
following his retirement, with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.
Together with Melissa Wells-Petry, the Armed Forces' acknowledged
expert on the policy banning service in the military by homosexuals,
Bob has guided FRC's work this summer on three major court cases
regarding the ban. One of these cases, <I>Thomasson v. Perry</I>,
may soon be considered by the U.S. Supreme Court.

<p>

Bob has been working diligently on the drug issue as well, and
one glance at the trends will tell you how urgent this is.  In
the past three years, drug abuse has spiraled, especially -- and
most disturbingly -- among elementary school-age children using
gateway drugs like marijuana.  Bob recently attended a major
international drug conference in Sweden, and in early August he
met with Gen. Barry McCaffrey, President Clinton's drug czar,
to lay out FRC's specific concerns.

<p>

<li>Then there's Marty Dannenfelser, FRC Director of Government
Relations, and his excellent staff who have worked long and hard
on the effort to override the Clinton veto of the partial-birth
abortion ban. A vote in Congress, on this issue, is expected
soon after Labor Day. Marty's experienced team also played a
major role in the passage of a new bill which creates a national
commission on gambling, working in conjunction with our friend,
Congressman Frank Wolf (R- Va.).

<p>

<li>FRC has also been blessed to have the talents of Bob Morrison
and Jennifer <i>A</i>. Marshall on education issues, Jennifer
<i>E</i>. Marshall (that middle initial is not a misprint -- the
mail-sorting staff at FRC has its hands full!) on welfare reform
and voluntarism, Ryan Dobson (Jim Dobson's son) on youth issues,
and Steve Knudsen, our new director of state and local affairs,
who helped put together our recent press conference with state
family policy councils to endorse laws barring same-sex marriage.

</ul><p>

These are just a few of the activities that have kept FRC moving
at a sprinter's pace this summer. I wish I could tell you more
about the work of each and every member of our dedicated staff
members in Washington, D.C. and in Holland, Michigan, where our
constituent services and information systems teams are located.
FRC's team is top-notch, and it includes you, our beloved supporters.
Working together, we can make a significant difference in the
future of our country... in the way our families, our children,
and our grandchildren will spend their lives.

<p>

Thank you for all you do to help keep FRC moving forward. Your
involvement in our work is essential to our success.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S. While we've been busy running the race, financial support
for our work has fallen into the typical summer doldrums.  Your
help would give FRC a special boost right now, so please consider
making a contribution if you possibly can. Again, thank you -- and
God bless you.

<title>Why We Should Be Worried About Russia - Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h3>WHY WE SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT RUSSIA </h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/cohen.htm">Ariel Cohen</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
 February 29, 1996<br>

<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Russia has the potential to become a far more dangerous and unstable adversary than the Soviet Union ever was. Yet, as the April summit between President Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin approaches, U.S. and international policy-makers seem oblivious to developments that daily make a future belligerent regime in Russia more likely.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Board of Directors of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is considering granting Russia a $10.2 billion loan, and the U.S.- run Export-Import Bank may provide an additional $1 billion to boost Russia's flagging civilian aircraft industry. President Clinton strongly endorses the IMF loan, hoping it will bolster Yeltsin's faltering presidency. But giving Russia a handout will only encourage Russia on its destructive course. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If a hard-line communist like Gennady Zyuganov were to carry the presidential election this June, which looks increasingly likely, IMF credits would be going to precisely the kind of regime that could resume threatening the United States and Europe with nuclear weapons. There is a chance that these loans would never be repaid since, under a communist government, Russia could sever relations with the IMF and the World Bank.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Economic reforms in Russia are grinding to a halt. First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais, the last remaining radical reformer in Yeltsin's cabinet, was forced to resign to appease Yeltsin's nationalist and communist critics, whose power and influence are gaining strength. Vladimir Kadannikov, Chubais' replacement, directed Russia's inefficient auto-making giant VAZ, whose low-quality products have long been the laughingstock of Europe.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Meanwhile, in 1995 Russia's inflation rate raged between 120 and 130 percent, budget deficits remain very high, and privatization has failed to raise the revenues to reduce them. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Leading Yeltsin administration officials such as Interior Minister General Anatoly Kulikov, along with communist deputies in the Duma, are seriously considering reversing privatization and stopping economic reforms in their tracks. Communists and their allies control the majority of the Duma's committees and the powerful Duma Executive Council.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Moreover, election pressures have forced Yeltsin to break budgetary constraints and promise billions of dollars in credits and payments to powerful industry groups.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For example, about $4 billion was earmarked for the defense industry and $2.2 billion in back wages has been promised to public-sector workers. The notoriously inefficient Russian miners, who went on strike in December 1995, were promised another $2 billion; $3.3 billion has been pledged to the agricultural sector; half a billion dollars went to pensioners, and more than $1 billion will be paid to officers and soldiers in the armed forces. All of these are panic-driven political payoffs by a frightened regime fighting for its survival.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Instead of offering a handout to the Russian government, the IMF and the World Bank ought to be providing policy advice to Russian leaders on decreasing tax rates to boost private enterprise and encouraging investment to make the Russian economy more attractive for domestic and foreign entrepreneurs. Only when investment, both foreign and domestic, is able to create prosperity for the Russian people will the tensions tearing the country apart be eased.   
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Russia has become such an investment risk that more than $12 billion a year is leaving the country  to be deposited in foreign banks. Such capital flight -- the result of incoherent economic policies -- is starving the Russian economy of investment and taxable income and creating political unrest. Even as it asks the IMF for loans, Moscow is forgiving sizable debts owed to it: $8 billion owed by Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi; $3 billion owed by the Sandinista regime of Nicaragua; and $250 million owed by Ethiopia. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Meanwhile, Russia continues to prosecute the war against Chechnya. According to estimates by Russian economists, this war is costing more than $4.5 billion a year. The IMF should not subsidize such a war, or any other military ventures into which a future Russian hard-line president might drag the country.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Most ominous of all, the country may be on the brink of a takeover by Gennady Zyuganov, the leader of the unreformed communists who has promised to restore the U.S.S.R. "by voluntary means."  Leading in opinion polls, he is followed by ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who has declared he will restore the Russian empire and possibly expand it even further into the Middle East.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton administration should not lobby the IMF on behalf of Russia. More money  is not what Russia needs. At best the money will be wasted; at worst, it could be abused by a future anti-Western leadership. Instead, President Clinton should take the lead in ensuring that all aid to Russia is conditioned on the adoption of free-market and democratic reforms. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Otherwise, the foundation for a Russia more dangerous than the Soviet Union will continue to be laid.

<h3>
JERRY-RIGGED FOREIGN POLICY</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/holmes.htm">Kim Holmes</a><br>
Vice President and Director of Foreign Policy and Defense Studies <br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
June 6, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
.

	The Clinton administration is about to make the same mistake in Bosnia it made in Somalia, where 18 U.S. Marines died unnecessarily. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The White House recently announced it would expand the role of the U.S.-led peacekeeping force in Bosnia to include scouring the countryside for war criminals. This is something the administration specifically promised not to do, a role that was purposefully left out of the Dayton Peace Accords because of its divisiveness and its potential for indefinitely expanding the Bosnia mission and producing casualties.   
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Why is the administration taking this step? It wants to apprehend Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his military chief Ratko Mladic, both still exercising control over Serb-held territory. And no wonder: If these two are not apprehended, it will be difficult for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to sanction elections scheduled for September, as called for in the peace accords. 	
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Without elections, no stable government will be established in Bosnia. With no government, withdrawing U.S. troops, as President Clinton promised, may not happen. In other words, the house of cards the president set up in Bosnia could come crashing down. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Of course, if by November election time it doesn't look like U.S. troops will come home soon, the president's Bosnia policy will be revealed for what it is: a jerry-rigged, politically tuned deal that puts U.S. forces at the mercy of events that can spin out of control at any time. To avoid this perception, the White House apparently is willing to risk substantial U.S. casualties -- both Karadzic and Mladic travel with 50 to 60 heavily armed escorts. But if Americans die, a la Somalia, the backlash could be even worse. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The whole mess is typical of the foreign policy ineptitude shown by this administration from the beginning. The Clinton team, influenced by its opposition to the Vietnam War, came into office confused about which situations warrant U.S. military intervention, and which do not. It became clear that the president believed  multinational peacekeeping was the wave of the future for U.S. foreign policy. The administration appeared more comfortable with the idea of "foreign policy as social work." This global utopianism led the president to commit America to dubious peacekeeping efforts in Somalia, Haiti and Bosnia, with sometimes tragic, never satisfactory results. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Few Americans realize how many gross errors and misjudgments have been made in foreign policy. Consider:<ul>
	<li>The White House has wasted precious years during which America could have erected global anti-missile defenses. For less than $3 billion it could have upgraded the Navy's Aegis fleet air-defense system as many experts have proposed, spending another $5 billion later on space-based sensors. Instead, the administration has done nothing in the face of CIA estimates that at least 20 countries already have or may be developing weapons of mass destruction and the ballistic missile systems to deliver them.	
	<p><li>The Clinton Pentagon determined that America needed to be able to fight two regional conflicts "nearly simultaneously." Yet the president has neglected to provide the funding needed to sustain this capability. 
	<p><li>The administration has zig-zagged on China policy, at times threatening, at other times appeasing, sending confused signals throughout Asia that have undermined U.S. credibility in the region and heightened tensions between China and Taiwan. 
	<p><li>The administration secretly tried to make a deal with Fidel Castro whereby Cuban boat people would be sent back forcibly to Cuba instead of being allowed into the United States. This betrayal of the Cuban people -- overturning 30 years of principled U.S. policy -- was only abandoned after Cuba shot down two U.S. civilian aircraft.   
	<p><li>The White House has organized a multi-billion-dollar deal that will give North Korea two nuclear reactors -- and still we don't know for sure whether Pyongyang has discontinued its budding nuclear-weapons program. 
	<p><li>In Haiti, America spent $2 billion to put in office an avowed Marxist  known for his hostility to the United States, all in the name of "restoring democracy." Whatever it is, the regime now in place is no democracy. 
<p>	<li>Finally, with no U.S. interests at stake, the White House sent U.S. forces to Bosnia, when it could have simply lifted the arms embargo on the Bosnian Muslims and allowed them to defend themselves. Now, worried that failure in Bosnia could threaten its standing in the polls, the White House is playing with the possibility of expanding and lengthening the mission, thus unnecessarily placing U.S. forces in even greater danger.</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	This is no way to conduct foreign policy.<p>

After much talk and fanfare, the "<a href="/townhall/spotlights/9-18-95/welcome.html.cgi">train wreck</a>" is upon us and the Federal government has closed  (has anyone noticed?).  What that really means is that as of noon today (11/14/95), all nonessential services were stopped .  Which makes us ask, if some services are nonessential, why are taxpayers paying for them?<p> 

Never wanting to miss an opportunity to give away T-shirts to our users, weve' come up with a little contest.  When do you think the government will be reopened?  The rules are simple.  If you correctly guess the day and time at which the President signs the reconciliation bill, you will be eligible to win one of our fine shirts. 
<p>
The person who guesses correctly, or comes the closest, will be the winner.  If two or more get the day and time right, the recipient will be randomly selected from a pool made up of those who guessed correctly.  All submissions sent after the announcement of an agreement between the Congress and the President will not be eligible.  Remember, only one guess per person.
<p>
Let us know what you think about the closing of the Federal government.  Depending on ones political outlook, this is 
 either a disaster or a godsend.  One thing is sure, commuting into our Capitol Hill offices will be much easier as
long as this situation continues.

<title>The Unfinished Agenda on Unfunded Mandates - Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h2>THE UNFINISHED AGENDA ON UNFUNDED MANDATES</h2>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/antonel.htm">Angela Antonelli</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
March 21, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	One year after Congress passed a law to deal with the problem of "unfunded mandates," the results are not encouraging.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Few Americans have any idea that Washington forces all sorts of laws and regulations on state and local governments -- concerning everything from storm-water drainage to health care for illegal immigrants -- without giving states and localities so much as a penny to pay for them.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	State and local government officials and business leaders met recently in Washington to examine the preliminary recommendations of the Advisory Council on Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR). This is the body Congress assigned last year to examine how "unfunded mandates" are hurting state and local governments, as part of its <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/1?r104:./temp/~r104uCqz::+@1(S.+1)++">Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</a> of 1995. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As the ACIR's recommendations show, unfunded mandates are still busting state and local budgets, diverting much-needed money from law enforcement, fire fighting, education and other activities people really need. In short, Congress accomplished little with last year's reforms. This should come as no surprise. After all, the <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/11?r104:./temp/~r104YVpC::unfunded+mandates+reform+act+">
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</a> of 1995  did absolutely nothing to address existing mandates -- except to have the ACIR study them. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But the study is proving useful. Based on information from the National Governors' Association and dozens of other state and local governments and organizations, ACIR identified 14 mandates it sees as the biggest problems. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The report recommends that seven federal laws, including the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and the Fair Labor Standards Act, no longer apply to state and local governments. Another seven laws, including the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean Air Act, should be made more flexible or be funded more by the federal government instead of forcing state and local governments to pay.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Of course, the report has its shortcomings. It doesn't say anything about how unfunded mandates affect the private sector and whether reforms should extend that far. There also are countless environmental, health and education mandates the report doesn't address. And while the ACIR acknowledges that laws like the Occupational Safety and Health Act may not have a legitimate scientific basis, the ACIR's report doesn't reach into whether the laws themselves should be changed. Asking Congress to exempt states and localities from laws that are ill-conceived in the first place sets a bad precedent and creates a double standard for treatment of the private sector.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In short, the ACIR report just scratches the surface of a huge problem. Costly requirements imposed by Washington are undermining the fiscal health of state and local governments. For example, every three years the Safe Drinking Water Act requires the Environmental Protection Agency to identify 25 new substances localities must test for in their water supplies -- forcing cities across America to bear the cost of testing for substances that literally have been banned for decades. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Another example: A <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/cb22.html">study</a> by The Heritage Foundation showed that state spending on Medicaid will increase from $32 billion in 1990 to $104 billion in 2002, a 325 percent boost, if there is no reform of the current program. States like California and New York will have to raise additional billions just to pay for their share of this program.  
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Unfunded mandates can force states to raise taxes; reduce spending on education, infrastructure, law enforcement or some other service; or both. For example, in September 1995, Fairfax County, Va. reported that half its non-school budget is being consumed by programs and mandates issued by Congress and the Virginia General Assembly, for which the county receives no funds. In February, the county executive was forced to propose one of the largest tax increases in the county's history, as well as dramatic reductions in education and social service programs.. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Despite their limitations, the ACIR recommendations should give states and localities hope. They confirm that the burden of unfunded mandates is real and significant. The ACIR's final report could create the foundation for a new round of legislative initiatives. These could range from full federal funding of mandates to outright repeal.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	However, if state and local communities expect change, they will have to continue badgering Washington through legislation and the courts. Unless states and localities are vigilant in keeping Congress and the president focused on addressing the problem of unfunded mandates, there will be no reform at all. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Washington will be all too happy to keep passing the buck.  
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<title>Welfare Reform and the Death of Marriage  Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>


<h3>WELFARE REFORM AND THE DEATH OF MARRIAGE</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm">Robert Rector</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
February 22, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Congress is considering adopting a welfare reform plan 
recently put forward by the nation's governors. Unfortunately, the governors plan blithely ignores 
Americas No. 1 social problem: the catastrophic rise of illegitimacy. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Nearly a third of  American children born last year were 
born out of wedlock. The illegitimate birthrate is now rising one percentage point every year. In the 
black community the out-of-wedlock birthrate is now 69 percent. This figure astounds even Sen. 
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., who first issued his prophetic warnings about the erosion of  
marriage among blacks in the early 1960s. Moynihans warning was dismissed at the time, but the 
breakup of the black family and the accompanying social calamities have far outstripped his worst 
nightmares. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Ominously, the illegitimate birthrate among whites is 
now edging toward 25 percent, almost exactly equaling the black rate when Moynihan first raised 
his alarm. The white family is now teetering on the same precipice, heading rapidly toward the 
same lethal decomposition that devastated black communities in the late 1960s and 1970s.
<p>	
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Family collapse is the root cause of other social problems: 
poverty, crime, drug abuse, and school failure. Children born out of wedlock are seven times more 
likely to be poor than are those born to couples who stay married. Girls raised in single-parent 
homes on welfare are five times more likely to give birth out of wedlock when compared to girls 
from intact non-welfare families. And a boy from a single-parent home in the inner city is twice as 
likely to engage in crime when compared to a similar boy who is poor, but living with a father and 
a mother.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The nations governors have responded to this grim 
reality by ignoring it. In unveiling their welfare reform plan they have declared that there are three 
key elements to real welfare reform:  1.) providing more government-funded day-care;  2.) 
increasing child-support payments from absent fathers; and 3.) imposing time limits and work 
requirements (with lots of loopholes) on welfare recipients. The rise in illegitimacy and collapse of 
marriage do not merit even a token comment, let alone aggressive policies, from the governors. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Thus, over the last year, the welfare debate has 
undergone a radical metamorphosis from a focus on combating illegitimacy to a focus on providing 
public support services to an ever-expanding population of single mothers. Eschewing the issue of 
illegitimacy entirely, the governors plan instead appears as preparation for a future in which 
marriage plays a sharply diminished role, and the government is heavily involved in meeting the 
needs of an burgeoning population of single-parent families.  The triumph of the left on this aspect 
of the debate has been complete: Fighting illegitimacy is out and funding government day-care is 
in.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Some would argue that federal action on illegitimacy is 
unneeded: If left alone, the governors will, on their own, tackle the problem. But the governors 
silence speaks volumes. Few, if any, governors have made reducing illegitimacy a central theme of 
reform; most are reluctant even to mention the topic. But by refusing to acknowledge or mention 
the collapse of marriage and the rise of illegitimacy in their plan, the governors are implicitly 
condoning and (through paralysis) ultimately promoting the skyrocketing rise in illegitimacy. They 
are clearly embarked on a path that will lead, in the near future, to half of all children being born 
out of wedlock and raised in government day-care centers. This is not reform. It is a national 
disaster.
<p>
	&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The governors plan, borrowing heavily from the 
reform schemes of President Clinton and other liberal proposals, dovetails with the interests of 
Americas huge welfare bureaucracy -- an industry that thrives on social decay. While the plan will 
trim the growth rate of welfare spending slightly in the near term, by failing to deal with ballooning 
rates of illegitimacy it sets the stage for an explosive rise in welfare and social-service spending in 
the future.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Nor are the governors alone. Under its recently passed 
legislation, Congress is committed to spending nearly a half trillion dollars over seven years to 
subsidize and support illegitimacy and single parenthood through multiple welfare benefits, day-
care, job training and other services. Under the congressional plan, government will spend $1,000 
to subsidize single parenthood and illegitimacy for each dollar spent to reduce illegitimacy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The governors welfare reform plan would distort 
priorities even further. When the dust settles on welfare reform, even token efforts to fight 
illegitimacy will have fallen by the wayside.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This is a tragedy. Marriage in America is dying. The 
governors have prepared not a rescue plan but a coffin. Many in Congress now seem resigned to 
assuming roles as undertakers. The simple fact is that welfare reform is nonsense as long as the 
illegitimate birth rate continues to rise. The silence of the governors on the issue is deafening. The 
welfare debate has become like a tea party on the Titanic in which the participants politely refrain 
from mentioning that the deck is tilting 40 degrees.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Vision and leadership are sorely needed -- and are sorely 
lacking.

<h3>DON'T BRAKE FOR BIG GOVERNMENT</h3>
By Tyce Palmaffy<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
August 29, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;


	Americans have always looked on the Labor Day weekend as one last fling with summer. For most drivers, that once meant a lot of high-anxiety mileage, as they worried about keeping up with traffic while avoiding ticket-happy state troopers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But no longer. Last year Congress repealed  the National Maximum Speed Limit of 55 mph (65 mph on rural interstates and freeways designed for high speeds).  Now states can set their own speed limits based on local driving conditions. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For more than 20 years, the Democratic leadership in Congress blocked all efforts to overturn this anachronism. In 1995, though, the tide changed. With their robust commitment to limited government, conservative House and Senate freshmen strongly pushed for a repeal -- and were finally successful when President Clinton reluctantly signed their bold legislation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Since the repeal, more than 20 states have raised their limits, including seven within a week of the repeal's effective date. Four of those states -- Oklahoma, Wyoming, Nevada and Arizona -- posted a top speed of 75 mph, while Montana eliminated its daytime speed limit for passenger vehicles, reverting to its pre-1974 law requiring drivers to maintain a "reasonable and prudent speed."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The results? Highway patrolmen and state traffic engineers in Montana and in every other state I spoke with -- 11 in all -- report that average speeds have only increased one to two mph. Fatalities have actually decreased in some states. So much for safety advocates' apocalyptic predictions. 	Patrolmen and traffic engineers -- whose reputations depend on drivers' safety --resoundingly supported the repeal because it permits states to set more reasonable speed limits. According to engineers, the proper method of determining limits is to measure the speed of traffic under ideal conditions. The posted speed limit should be the speed that 85 percent of traffic is traveling. In effect, drivers set the speed limit.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	On many highways, the federally mandated 55 and 65 mph speed limits were unreasonably low -- often five or 10, and sometimes 15 mph below this driver-imposed maximum. The feds, of course, set the low limits in the name of safety. Yet, when people drive at the 85th percentile speed, they "are least likely to be in motor vehicle crashes," according to engineer Tom Hicks of the Maryland State Highway Administration. "It's the people who drive much slower or faster who are most at risk."	Unreasonably low speed limits exacerbate the risk posed by these slower and faster drivers. Alan Soltani, the chief traffic engineer at the Oklahoma Department of Transportation, says when the driver-set maximum was 75 and the speed limit was set at 55, "drivers weren't comfortable -- some drove 55, some 65, some 75. There was so much variance that accidents increased." When the limit is raised to its proper level, the evidence shows, these dangerous variances in speed start to disappear. 	
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Efforts to enforce unreasonably low speed limits also undermine police effectiveness. In 1978, Congress started requiring the states to certify drivers' compliance with the 55 mph limit or face cuts in their federal highway funds. So highway patrolmen were told to enforce a law that the majority of motorists were breaking -- a law that threatened rather than improved safety. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Indeed, in a 1984 study of the effects of the 55 mph speed limit, the National Research Council found that 29 percent of highway patrol hours were devoted to rural interstates, where only 9 percent of traffic fatalities occurred. This means more dangerous roads -- such as undivided country highways, high-speed two-lane roads and highways running through congested commercial areas -- received less attention. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	By requiring states to prove they were enforcing the 55 mph speed limit, the federal legislation effectively reduced patrol presence on non-interstates while increasing the traffic on these roadways. This substantially endangered safety.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"People move off and onto interstates depending on the speed," says Bill Jackman, a representative of the American Automobile Association. "If the speed limit is only 55 or 65, they will move onto a country road that will get them there just as fast. The problem there is that the fatality rate is three times higher when you get off the interstates. Interstates are the safest highways we have." With repeal of the federal limit, states can post more realistic limits that will attract drivers to the safer interstates.	The repeal of the national speed limit may even signal new attitudes in Washington. Restoring the states' authority on this issue means trusting them to form safe and responsible policies. And if we can trust the states in this area, why not others?

<title>Family Tax Credit Could Pay for College -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>

<h3><i>TAX CREDIT COULD PAY FOR COLLEGE</i></h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">Robert E. Moffit</a><br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
December 20, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>	
<p>
	One of the reasons Washington has failed to pass a budget for 1996 is that President Clinton believes Congress has been too zealous in cutting government education programs.  
<p>What the president did not say -- and may not even know -- is that by opposing Congress's plan to give families a $500-per-child tax credit, he effectively denies millions of American families a greater financial opportunity to send their children to college.
<p>	That's right. The fact of the matter is that Congress's balanced budget plan is one of the most education-friendly bills in quite some time. And since the budget wrangling between Congress and the White House isn't over yet, there's still a good chance to save its most important benefits. Consider the following:
<p>	1.)  My colleagues at <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a> have calculated that if an average American family saved the entire $500-per-child tax credit for a period of 18 years, that family would be able to accumulate an amount of money equal to what $14,000 buys today. That's more than enough to pay the average cost of an education at a public university.  
<p>
	2.)  Heritage analysts also have shown that the $500-per-child tax credit would provide families that can't afford private education with enough money to pay nearly 25 percent of the tuition at a typical private elementary school. This would increase the number of parents able to send their children to private schools, just like so many members of Congress do today.  
<p> 3.) Congress's seven-year balanced budget plan would cause interest rates to drop by at least 0.5 percent below what they will be if current federal budget and tax policies are kept in place. This reduction in rates would save a student more than $400 on the cost of an average student loan. Four hundred dollars is enough to pay for a year's worth of books, two additional classes, or even a third of the cost of a personal computer.
<p>	These are all benefits President Clinton will deny American families and students if  he  forces Congress to abandon the $500-per-child tax credit. Why then does he continue to lambaste Congress for cutting spending on education? After all, Congress's balanced budget plan would cut less than 2 percent per year during the next seven years from a federal education budget that represents only a tiny fraction of the total spent on education across the country. In other words, President Clinton would deny 28 million American families the ability to pay tuition for their 51 million children to go to college -- rather than cut a tiny portion of a budget that itself is a tiny fraction of America's educational effort.
<p>	From the president's point of view, such cuts are "anti-education." But from the vantage point of the average American family, the picture is quite different. After all, which do you think eventually will have a greater positive impact on your child's education: Four years of college, or programs run by the U.S. Department of Education?
<p>
Think of what you could do for your children's education with an extra $500 per year. You could save more than enough to send each child to a solid public university for four years. You could afford to purchase an encyclopedia set, a personal computer, the services of a tutor or any number of other educational values. Congress is offering these to the American people, and President Clinton doesn't like it. Why? Because the choice would be left in your hands. Like his ill-fated health-care plan, he wants the key decisions to be made by the bureaucrats.
<p>	The question Washington faces is this: Is a good education policy one that expands the reach and control of federal programs, as President Clinton apparently believes? Or is it a policy that expands the choices available to American families so they can afford the cost of a private elementary school and send their children to college?
<p>	I submit two more points to consider before this choice is made:
<ul><p>
	<li>The money spent on public elementary and secondary education has increased more 
than 200 percent since 1960. Spending by the U.S. Department of Education has increased 634 percent since 1962. What has all this money done for our kids? Over the same period, average SAT scores have declined 73 points.
<p>
	<li> It is not surprising why more families are choosing private schools for their children. A private-school graduate is 52 percent more likely to apply to college than a public-school graduate. And an average college graduate earns a salary nearly 80 percent higher than that of the average high-school graduate. 
</ul><p>
	So, next time President Clinton claims Congress is trying to deny education to children, ask yourself: Who is more concerned about my child's education? The bureaucrats who get my money if the president has his way -- or the private school or college that gets it if I make the decisions myself? Can we, as a nation afford another three decades, or even seven years, of declining test scores, bureaucracy as usual, and an increasingly undereducated workforce? 
<p>	The time to return control of our children's education to American families is now. One way to do it is to stand by a budget plan that does just that.

<title>What Would George Washington Say? -- Heritage Commentary</title><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>

<h3>WHAT WOULD GEORGE WASHINGTON SAY?</h3>
By Matthew Spalding<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
September 12, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Imagine picking up your morning newspaper and reading the headline: "President To Resign; Issues Solemn Warnings To Nation." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	This startling news greeted readers of Philadelphia's largest newspaper on the morning of Sept. 19, 1796, when George Washington unexpectedly announced his retirement from the presidency of the United States. The nation would have been happy to see him continue.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	But our first president wanted to set an example for his successors, and as he left public life he offered the nation a document that is one of the greatest in American history. On its 200th anniversary, Washington's Farewell Address -- although remembered primarily for its advice on foreign affairs -- gives us much insight into how he might view America in the 1990s. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	In it, Washington warned us of the dangers of Big Government. He told us to watch out for the tendency of government to encroach on individual freedoms and consolidate its power. What American can say this warning has not been justified by subsequent events? "A just estimate of that love of power, and proneness to abuse it, which predominates in the human heart is sufficient to satisfy us of the truth of this position," Washington said. We could add: Any doubt that might be left can be put to rest by assessing the size and reach of the U.S. government in 1996. 	
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Our only defense against an over-reaching, tyrannical government, Washington insisted, is the Constitution's strict limits on government power. Washington said that unless these limits were carefully adhered to -- that is, unless the federal government exercised only those functions specifically delegated to it by the Constitution and by the authority of the people, and no more -- the nation would become vulnerable to "cunning, ambitious and unprincipled men."  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Could Americans' distrust of their elected representatives, their sense that government has overextended its proper authority, and that average citizens no longer have enough say in matters that affect them, be the result of disregarding Washington's warning? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Washington warned of "the baneful effects of the Spirit of Party" and the notorious problem of faction. By this he didn't mean what me mean by "parties," but instead what we call "special-interest groups" pushing their own single-issue agendas at the expense of wider, more serious concerns having to do with the common good. He called partisan spirit "a fire not to be quenched; it demands a uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into a flame, lest instead of warming it should consume."  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	How many times in recent decades have Americans watched in despair as partisanship overshadowed principle in the nation's capital; as one special interest in Congress prevented another from passing a good law? Washington believed fundamental change in a free government comes about not through clever strategies, "hot button" issues or attack ads but by honest deliberation, patient persuasion, and a willingness to put principle above self-interest.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	In his Farewell Address, Washington also told Americans that while their Constitution creates a framework for good government, it could only work if the people govern themselves rightly. In the absence of governmental restraints, the people would have to restrain their own passions and prejudices. Washington meant to encourage religion and morality as "indispensable supports" for political prosperity. He cautioned Americans never to expect virtue from their elected representatives if they were not moral, virtuous people themselves.   
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Two centuries later social scientists are just discovering what Washington always knew: that religious belief and moral education are the surest social inoculation against crime, drug abuse,  illegitimacy and practically every other social ill one can name. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	By ignoring much of Washington's advice, America has moved far down the path he said had "hitherto marked the Destiny of Nations." Today our government is virtually unlimited and out of control; politics is dominated by base factionalism and personal invective; our culture is adrift from the breakup of community and the family; we increasingly question our national purpose and role in the world.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Amidst these seemingly intractable problems, Americans would do well to look to the father of their country -- and the Farewell Address -- for guidance. His "counsels of an old and affectionate friend," as he called them, are as true in 1996 as they were in 1796.

<title>Gary Bauer's April, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

April 15, 1996

<p><center>

<i>

&quot;We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed;<br>
we are perplexed, but not in despair;<br>
Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed.&quot;

<p>

-2 Corinthians 4: 8-9

</i>

</center><p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

I write to you this month on a subject that weighs heavily on
my heart.  That subject is the persecution of believers around
the world, including here in the United States.  As I've learned
more about the nature and extent of this persecution, it has become
increasingly clear to me that as Christians, we must do more for
our suffering brothers and sisters both here and abroad.  From
China to Saudi Arabia to Sudan, one's profession of faith in Jesus
Christ is becoming an ever more dangerous act in the eyes of the
state.  It is time for men and women of faith to speak up!

<p>

Michael Horowitz is one man who has courageously raised his voice
on this issue.  Mike and I go back many years, to the days when
we both served in the Reagan administration.  My primary responsibilities
were education and the family.  Mike's were economic and regulatory
matters in the Office of Management and Budget.  We worked together
on several issues, and I observed the character of this man up
close.  For that reason, it didn't surprise me at all last summer
when Mike Horowitz, who is Jewish, wrote a heart-rending article
on anti-Christian persecution for <I>The Wall Street Journal.</I>

<p>

Mike was appalled by the harassment, physical abuse and
even death being routinely inflicted on Christians overseas.
But he was even more appalled by the continued refusal of our
government to focus on and do anything about this persecution.
And I have been deeply disappointed by the timidity and silence
that unfortunately have reigned among so many Christians in America,
who, myself included, needed to hear the eloquence of Mike Horowitz
to be shaken with the conviction that we must act.

<p>

This past January, I attended a meeting of evangelical leaders
in Washington, DC that Mike cosponsored with Freedom House.  Freedom
House is a widely respected human rights organization, founded
at the outbreak of World War II.  The information they shared
regarding systematic persecution of Christians was overwhelming:

<p><ul>

<li>Incidents of intimidation, arrest, and torture are growing
under various regimes around the world.  The worst offenders are 
Islamic fundamentalist governments and communist regimes. Millions 
of Christians worldwide are routinely subjected to this persecution, 
most of which goes unreported in the United States.

<p>

<li>In Sudan, 1.5 million people have died as a result of the Islamic
north's <i>jihad</i>, or &quot;holy war,&quot; against the largely 
Christian south.[1] The war has displaced another 5 million. Children 
of Christian parents are being conscripted for service in the
Islamic government army.  One mother, of boys eight and nine,
was imprisoned and savagely beaten when she went to retrieve them 
from a <i>mujahadeen</i> training camp.[2] She was pregnant at the 
time. Thousands of children of Christian parents, as young as six, 
have been taken and sold as slaves in Sudan, Libya and elsewhere.[3]

<p>

<li>Three of the most prominent evangelical leaders in Iran were
abducted and murdered in 1994.  The law there effectively prohibits
Christians from attending any kind of religious service, and those 
who dare to evangelize have been arrested, brutally tortured, and 
forced to renounce their faith.[4]

<p>

<li>Christians who flee Iran through Turkey are forced by the American
Embassy there to undergo interviews by Turkish security police who are
sympathetic toward Iran's laws against &quot;blasphemy.&quot;  Many of 
these refugees fail these interviews and face forcible return to Iran. 
American Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) field offices 
commonly treat refugees the same way.[5] In other words, the only things 
we are &quot;exporting&quot; to Iran are Christians!

<p>

<li>The government of Egypt, which has received billions of dollars
in U.S. assistance (our tax money!), has attempted to appease 
domestic Islamic fundamentalists by imprisoning and torturing Christian 
converts and evangelists.

<p>

<li>In China, persecution of the country's estimated 30 million
Christians is a matter of official public policy.  Catholics in the 
People's Republic are permitted to join only the official state church, 
whose bishops are appointed by Beijing and not by the pope. If they 
refuse to &quot;register,&quot; they are routinely imprisoned and
tortured or, in the classic communist style, &quot;re-educated
through labor&quot; -- the official euphemism for doing hard time in 
the labor camps.

</ul><p>

Recently, FRC's chief of government relations, Marty Dannenfelser,
testified before a House International Relations subcommittee
on this plague of persecution.  He made it clear that our government
has not done enough to highlight and to halt these disgraceful
abuses.  We reject the idea that these problems will go away through
quiet diplomacy, or that abuses will only increase if our government
openly criticizes the perpetrators.  History shows that speaking
out is the only way to deter tyrants.

<p>

Our own government must cease its tolerance of the mistreatment
of religious minorities around the world.  Saudi Arabia is a prime
example.  Recently the Saudis pressured the United States about
&quot;objectionable&quot; activities by American nationals stationed
there.  One complaint involved the operation of a U.S.-sponsored
nightclub frequented by American servicemen.  Our government dug
in its heels and refused to bow to Saudi requests to close it.
At the same time, the Saudis demanded that we stop holding Sunday
worship services at our embassy in Riyadh -- that is, on U.S. soil!
To this, the Clinton Administration buckled under.

<p>

I mentioned at the beginning of this letter that the United States
is also troubled by anti-Christian persecution.  The major difference,
of course, is that the examples I am about to cite are not sponsored
or tolerated by our government.  Nevertheless, their impact on
the religious liberties we hold so dear can be just as devastating.
In the past few years, the United States has experienced a wave
of violent attacks on Christian churches.  According to an investigative
report compiled by <I>USA Today</I>, some 25 black churches, primarily
in the South, have been the targets of arson.  The pace of these
attacks is clearly accelerating.

<p>

The wave seems to have begun on April 4, 1993, the 25th anniversary
of the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 
Twelve churches were burned last year, and so far this year at
least seven more have been torched.  In roughly two thirds of
these incidents, no arrests have been made.  This month, of course,
brings another anniversary of Dr. King's death, and many fear
that the attacks on churches will worsen.  Again, the only way
to prevent this tragedy from happening is for each of us to speak
out against these crimes and for the government to bring the 
perpetrators to justice.

<p>

In February, FRC joined with several evangelical, Jewish, Catholic
and civil rights groups in calling for congressional hearings
into these incidents.  The Federal Bureau of Investigation has
also begun to investigate them, but the added visibility of Congressional
hearings can serve a number of useful purposes.  After our call
for hearings, the Congressional Family Caucus, whose roster includes
several dozen freshman members of Congress, also issued a plea
for hearings.  As I'm writing this, FRC has received assurances
from House Judiciary Committee staff that in-depth hearings will
occur later this spring.

<p>

FRC is also calling upon the Clinton administration to speak
out forcefully on these events.  Attorney General Janet Reno shoulders
a special responsibility to ensure that potential arsonists know
that the full weight of federal law enforcement will be brought
to bear to end these attacks.  We have publicly urged her to show
the same zeal in pursuing the perpetrators of these incidents
as she has shown in pursuing her theories of conspiracy among
peaceful protestors outside abortion clinics!

<p>

It's too early to know for certain, but these attacks on churches
are most likely motivated by both religious <b>and</b> racial
bigotry.  Anti-Christian bigotry is the American &quot;exception&quot; 
-- the only acceptable form of intolerance in modern America.  Just 
consider how muffled the response was to the invasion of St. Patrick's
Cathedral in New York by members of the homosexual group Act-Up.
The Montrose Baptist Church, in suburban Washington, DC, has
also been the target of two suspicious fires in recent years.
It is probably no coincidence that the church was heavily involved
on the pro-life side of Maryland's recent abortion referendum.

<p>

Racial prejudice is obviously at work, too.  The damage it wreaks
on America's social fabric is astonishing.  It makes me wonder
if Americans will ever judge one another by the content of our
character, and not the color of our skin.  Can this hatred that
affronts the gospel of Christ continue to divide our house and
drag this nation down?  Our greatest hope is for spiritual revival
to again sweep our land and to bring about healing through reconciliation
within families and between races.  Then and only then will we
know our country is well on the road to recovery.

<p>

The seeds of ethnic hatred should find no fertile soil in this
land we love. That is why I included the following statement
in the Compact with Our Fellow Americans that appears in my new
book, <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I>:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

In our work and community life, we promise to elevate a public
ethic of individual merit, regardless of ethnic or national origin, 
or political or religious belief. We will not tolerate the expression, 
public or private, of bigotry on any such basis.  We will judge 
all persons we meet by the content of their character, not the color 
of their skin.

</i>

</blockquote><p>

As this statement suggests, the task of combating religious and
racial hatred is not, first of all, the task of government.  It
is every citizen's task, a battle within the heart that, won there,
cannot be lost in the public square.

<p>

In closing, let me ask that you take up your pen right away and
urge your representatives in Congress to act decisively on these
twin issues.  With a united America behind them, they will be
empowered to act boldly.  In the meantime, let us heed the words
of the apostle Paul and cast off all distress and despair.  Where
we have Christ, we have hope.

<p>

We at FRC feel greatly blessed to be in the heart of our nation's
capital, with the daily chance to address our political leaders
on these vital concerns.  Your friendship and financial support
are part of that blessing, and you have my deepest thanks for
remembering us.  If your circumstances permit, your gift to us
this month will mean so much to our campaign on behalf of family,
faith, and freedom.  Your continued involvement and support are
essential to our success.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S. It's always difficult to end a letter like this with a
little house-keeping, but the enclosures this month require some
explanation.  As you know, FRC communicates with you on a regular
basis. You most likely receive both my monthly letter and <I>Washington
Watch,</I> and perhaps other mailings as well. Our goal
is to ensure that every item we send you is useful to your family.
At the same time, we are keenly aware of our responsibility to
exercise stewardship over the resources you entrust to us.  If
you are receiving any mail from FRC that is not meeting your needs,
this is your chance to let us know.  We look forward to continuing
to send you the timeliest pro-family reports available today.

<p>

Please return the enclosed card at your earliest opportunity and note, 
that while we do hope you will respond, <b>no financial gift is 
necessary</b>. Your reply will aid us in serving you -- and many more 
families besides -- to the best of our ability. God bless you.

<i>It was a great comfort to feel, all during the
last days when affairs looked doubtful, that no matter how things
came out the really important thing was the lovely life I have
with mother and with you children and that compared to this home
life everything else was of small importance from the stand point

Theodore Roosevelt<br>
from a letter to his son Kermit<br>
1904</i>

</ul></ul></ul></ul>

<p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

Christmas comes to Washington, D.C., much the
same way it comes to your hometown.  Street lights come on earlier,
stores stay open later, there are smiles on more faces, and bell-ringing
members of the Salvation Army brave the cold and take up their
posts.  Around the city seasonal decorations are hung from every
pillar and post, multi-colored bulbs burn in windows and on trees.
Fervent prayers for safe travel go forth, as we remember Christmases
past and eagerly anticipate the arrival of family members, including
sons and daughters from college or military assignments around
the globe.

<p>

Yes, Christmas comes to Washington as it does
to every other city, but it comes here with a rather peculiar
force.  Partly it's because of the history of our nation's capital,
but even more significantly, I think, it's because of the political
nature of this city.  Throughout most of the year, an air of aggressive
secularity reigns in Washington.  Faith is not absent here, but
it too often takes a backseat to the public business being conducted.
Not so at Christmas-time, however.  As an anonymous writer once
noted about Christmas in Washington, &quot;Officially, the government
of the United States does not celebrate religious holidays.  Unofficially,
of course, it does.&quot;

<p>

That &quot;unofficial&quot; celebration of the
birth of Christ has irresistible power.  The white columns of
government buildings are festooned with wreaths and ribbons.
Christmas trees are lit at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.
On the open Ellipse just south of the White House the National
Christmas Tree stands proudly, established by President Calvin
Coolidge and lit every year since 1923.  Each year, thousands
of visitors come to visit the tree and to see the life-sized Nativity
scene that even the Scrooges at the ACLU have been unable to dislodge.

<p>

On one occasion our National Christmas Tree
was nearly darkened -- not by church-and-state lawyers, but by
the nightmare of a nation at war.  On December 7, 1941, Japanese
forces attacked Pearl Harbor.  America entered the war and Nazi
Germany and Fascist Italy declared war upon us.  In those first
days of the conflict blackouts were declared along the East Coast
as American leaders feared the worst.

<p>

In Washington, too, a blackout was ordered.
Our military and the Secret Service compiled a list of actions
they wanted taken to protect the Executive Mansion and the Congress,
including even the repainting of the White House in standard Army
Air Corps camouflage.  President Franklin Roosevelt resisted many
of their recommendations, rightly sensing that they would seriously
depress the indomitable American spirit.  But one security demand
made him bristle the most:  <I>no Christmas Tree on the Ellipse</I>,
the agencies said, <I>it would be too obvious a target</I>.

<p>

But Roosevelt refused to give in, and on Christmas
Eve, 1941, President and Mrs. Roosevelt stood on the south portico
of the White House and threw a switch to light the National Christmas
Tree, as a national radio audience tuned their receivers.  In
the midst of the blackout, the tree provided the only light for
miles around.  Beside the Roosevelts on the portico stood Winston
Churchill, who had traveled secretly to Washington and arrived
only that morning to encourage his American partners.  That night,
the British leader delivered a message that captured the essence
of the symbol Roosevelt was defending in lighting the tree.  Churchill
spoke to (and for) all Americans when he said:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Let the children have their night of laughter . . . Let us
grown-ups share . . . in their unstinted pleasures
before we turn again to the stern tasks and the formidable
years that lie before us, resolved that by our sacrifice
and daring these same children shall not be robbed
of their inheritance or denied their right to live in
a free and decent world.</i>

</blockquote><p>

Today, of course, the clouds of war are not
gathered on every side.  But Churchill's words, and the meaning
of Christmas, retain all of their urgency.  Sacrifice and daring
are still needed in this fight, fought with words of persuasion
and prayers of petition, for the right of our children and our
grandchildren to live in a free and decent world.  If I have any
goal at the Family Research Council, it is to continue to frustrate
the Scrooges and the nay-sayers by keeping the lights burning
brightly on the Christmas trees of family, faith and freedom all
throughout this great land.

<p>

Christmas truly is the feast of childhood.
On this holy day, we mark the event where our God in heaven came
to us as a child, with a message that we must come to Him as children
if we want to see His face.  The words of Teddy Roosevelt that
I quoted at the beginning of this letter offer us another reminder
of the meaning of our work in this life.  Teddy was a remarkable
president, but an excellent book about him called <I>A Bully Father</I>
reminds us of the priorities that ruled his life even in the midst
of political turmoil. Teddy Roosevelt placed his family first,
no matter what the season.

<p>

His ardent devotion to conservation led him
to refuse to place a freshly cut Christmas tree in the White House.
But during his White House years he turned a blind eye when his
sons carried a tree up into the residence and hid it in their
closet.  On Christmas morning, his letters to his children reveal,
he rejoiced in the family custom of gathering in his and Edith's
bedroom as the six children romped and peered into their stockings
and opened their presents.  These events recalled for TR &quot;just
such a Christmas&quot; as he had known in his youth, and it was
&quot;just such a Christmas&quot; he endeavored to reproduce exactly
for his own family.

<p>

This Christmas season, I'm sure your family
has its own traditions to relive, customs you seek to renew time
and time again.  It doesn't really seem to matter what they are:
large or small, children remember and treasure each one.  My prayer
is that you will enjoy each and every moment that you have together.

<p>

For my family, Christmas will be particularly
special this year.  For a short while, life once again will be
exactly as it was ... Carol and me coming down the stairs each
morning to find all of our children under our roof.  Our daughter
Elyse will be home from college after a long semester.  She hasn't
chosen a major yet, but increasingly she feels drawn toward political
science and law.  On campus, she really enjoys her involvement
in the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.  Our high school sophomore,
Sarah, is learning to drive.  In addition to that excitement,
every Tuesday she and a dozen classmates gather at our house at
6:30 in the morning to pray and share their love for God and His
Son Jesus Christ.  Our son, Zachary, just celebrated his 10th
birthday.  He continues to grow in his faith, while he uses his
God-given talents and abilities to play every sport possible.
His soccer season just ended and basketball practice has already
begun.

<p>

Now that I have filled you in on my family,
it occurs to me that we would like to have an update from you, too. 
A few years ago, I asked readers of my monthly letter to send us
a family picture and tell us about their family.  We still treasure
the pictures and letters we received.  With permission, many of
those letters and the incidents they relate have found a place
in one of our publications, like <I>Reunion</I> or <I>Let Freedom
Ring</I>, or in the military exhibit at our new location in 
Washington.

<p>

If you have a moment -- perhaps while you're
sending out your Christmas cards or in the quieter days after
Christmas -- could you send us an updated photograph and tell
us how your family is doing?  If you haven't written before or
are new to my letters, we're all the more anxious to learn something
about you and your family.  Your photos and letters mean a lot
to all of us at FRC.  They remind us, just as Teddy Roosevelt's
letter to Kermit does, why we're here and whom we represent. They
also remind us that our happiness rests on a foundation that no
one can take away.

<p>

Thank you for all you do in partnership with
us to help build and preserve that &quot;free and decent world&quot;
of which Churchill spoke.  Next month, I'll be writing to share
with you the specific policy steps we will be pursuing with the
105th Congress to help achieve that &quot;world&quot; -- steps
to protect the sanctity of human life, to clean up our polluted
culture, to ease the economic pressures on families, and to promote
education reforms that help ensure that every child hears the
kind of historical truths that are recounted in this letter.

<p>

From all of us at FRC to all of yours, both near
and far, we wish you a peaceful and blessed Christmas.  May God
be with you this holiday season and throughout the coming year.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S.  End-of-year gifts represent a major portion
of the funds the Family Research Council receives from our supporters.
As you consider the gifts you intend to make this Christmas,
I sincerely hope you will consider FRC worthy of your continued
support.

<title>Restoring Religious Freedom to Public Schools -- Heritage</title>

<h3> RESTORING RELIGIOUS FREEDOM TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS</h3>
By Joe Loconte<br>
Deputy editor of  <a href="/heritage/p_review">Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</a> <br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
June 20, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;





	Parades, fireworks, barbecues -- it's that time of year when Americans celebrate their bold, 220 year-old experiment in democracy and political freedom. When it comes to religious freedom, however, many people will not be in a celebratory mood.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Consider: An Illinois school district recently banned any reference to God in student presentations at a commencement program. A California high school prevented students from distributing invitations to a Bible study group. A school principal in Virginia barred a student from reading her Bible on a school bus.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While some Americans accept such bans as enforcement of the principle of separation of church and state, others are up in arms over what they consider outright religious persecution. Due to efforts by religious conservatives, Congress may soon unveil an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to prevent educators from muzzling permissible forms of religious speech. 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But Charles Haynes, an authority on religion and education issues -- and a religious conservative -- isn't sanguine about adding a postscript to the First Amendment. Although he laments a widespread failure to take religion seriously in the classroom, Haynes says a constitutional amendment isn't needed to protect religious expression. Despite some mistaken judicial rulings, he says, court interpretations of the First Amendment still permit private religious speech by students as well as classroom instruction about religion. "Let's try the Amendment we have before we add another one," he says. "We still really haven't tried to make the First Amendment work." 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Making it "work" means educating parents and teachers about the forms of religious expression still permissible under state and federal court rulings. Haynes, a scholar at Vanderbilt University, and Oliver Thomas, an expert on church-state law who has taught at Georgetown University Law Center, work district by district, getting educators and community leaders of different faiths to agree on three basic rules: (1) Schools must protect the religious freedoms of students of all faiths, or of no faith; (2) parents have primary responsibility for the education of their children; and (3) public debates must always be conducted with respect.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
School districts around the nation are signing up. Called the "Three Rs Project" (for Rights, Responsibilities and Respect), the program has been introduced in all of California's 58 counties. It has been endorsed by groups as diverse as the Anti-Defamation League, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Christian Educators Association International, and the California Teachers Association. And a growing number of states -- including Georgia, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, New York, Texas and Utah -- are moving ahead with the initiative.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Of course, if the program can work in California, it can work anywhere. The student bodies in some California districts speak 90 different languages -- and almost as many ways to talk about faith in the classroom.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Haynes and Thomas have met with school officials and community leaders throughout the state. Their <I>modus operandi</I>: Encourage local school boards to approve the Three Rs Project, organize teams of parents and educators to attend seminars on the First Amendment, send teachers to curriculum workshops, and build community support. If  this sounds like an old-fashioned civics lesson, it is -- and it seems to be working.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the Snowline School District in Southern California a few years ago, the stage was set for a church-state debacle: A teacher prevented a third-grade student from writing a report on Jonah and the whale; officials hesitated when a school board member donated books espousing creationism to the school library; a parent objected when a high-school student group wanted to start every meeting with prayer.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But the community, trained in the Three Rs program, was ready. The district peacefully reached agreements on each flash point: The Jonah report was approved, books on creationism now sit on library shelves, and the student group agreed to begin meetings with a moment of silence, not prayer. 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
"It's very clear that the student expression of religious values is almost never inhibited by the First Amendment," says Jan Vondra, assistant superintendent of curricula and education services at Snowline. Rather, it is the government's -- and hence, the public schools' -- religious speech that is restricted. "As long as their expressions are not disruptive, student freedoms are very, very broad," Vondra says.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Now there's a lesson in liberty: that neither pluralism nor separation of church and state need hush freedom of speech -- even religious speech -- in our public schools. <p>

<title>Chernobyl Times Two -- Heritage </title>

<center><h2>Chernobyl Times Two</h2><br>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>9/28/95<br>
<hr width=50%>
</center><p>
If you think the closest the United States ever came to nuclear disaster was at Three Mile Island, you probably aren't aware of communist dictator Fidel Castro's latest little construction project.
<p>Just 250 miles from Miami, the United States is facing what could be its greatest nuclear threat, in the form of a couple of Russian-designed nuclear reactors under construction in Juragua, near Cienfuegos. The Cubans are building not one, but two, nuclear accidents waiting to happen.
<p>What is so dangerous about these reactors? Here are just a few -- by no means all -- of the problems:
<p><ul>
<li>The reactors are of the same defective design as the nuclear reactor at Chernobyl that literally melted down, spreading radioactive fallout over thousands of square miles of Russia and Eastern Europe. 
<li>Sixty percent of the Soviet-supplied materials used in these reactors are defective, according to Cubans who have left the project.
<li>The containment dome of the first reactor is designed to withstand pressures of only seven pounds-per-square-inch (PSI), when U.S. reactors are only considered safe -- indeed are only allowed to be built -- if their domes can withstand 50 PSI.
<p></ul>
Castro had mothballed the project in the early 1990s because of U.S. objections. But work has resumed. Roger W. Robinson Jr., who worked at the National Security Council under President Reagan, recently told a House committee Castro may be resuming construction hoping to "shake down the U.S. and international communities for some kind of substantial compensatory alternative," as the North Koreans were able to do with their reactor project at Yongbyon. U.S. acquiescence in the recent Russian-Iranian nuclear deal also encourages Castro to pursue his goals.
<p>So the tale of two Chernobyls continues.
<p>With the completion of Castro's nuclear reactors, Cuba will gain a "menacing and even devastating new policy lever" in its relations with the United States, according to Robinson. He says a Cuban nuclear accident would have a similar effect as "the detonation of a nuclear weapon near the United States." Depending on the winds and other weather conditions, nuclear fallout could spread west as far as Texas and race up the eastern seaboard to Washington, D.C., within possibly four days.
<p>Oddly, the environmental community, usually foaming at the mouth over this type of scenario, is silent. Apparently, if the nuclear violator is one of their political heroes, Greenpeace, Worldwatch and other like-minded organizations are not nearly as anxious to chain themselves to construction equipment and halt progress on a nuclear project. 
<p>So what can be done?
<p>The fact is that short of a military strike -- which no one is seriously contemplating -- there's not much America can do. The Cienfuegos reactor project is just one more reminder of how vital it is that the United States do everything in its power -- continuing the economic embargo, intensifying it by bringing in other nations, keeping funding for Radio and TV Marti -- to oust Castro and his cronies from power in Cuba once and for all. 
<p>In the meantime, Congress also should call on Russian President Boris Yeltsin to remove all technical and financial assistance from the project. If Russia refuses, it should face a cutoff of U.S. economic aid.
<p>Of course, whether the Clinton administration is willing to take these steps depends on how worried it is. I think we should be more than a little concerned about two Chernobyl-style reactors being built -- not all the way across the Pacific Ocean like the North Korean reactors -- but only 250 miles from U.S. shores.

<title>Not Just a Rich Man's Issue -- Heritage Commentary</title>

<h3><i>NOT JUST A RICH MAN'S ISSUE</i></h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William W. Beach</a><br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
December 20, 1995<br>

<p>
	For decades, lawmakers who really know what makes the economy grow have been trying to cut America's capital gains tax. After all, every other industrialized nation has recognized the economic folly of penalizing thrift, responsibility and success, and has cut their capital gains tax or eliminated it entirely. 
<p>	Congress's balanced-budget plan contains the most recent effort to cut the tax on capital gains. During the back-and-forth debate, President Clinton accused Congress of trying to "give a tax break to the rich." 
<p>	But this simply isn't true. Based on my analysis of 1991 tax returns -- the most recent, detailed data available from the Internal Revenue Service -- more than 50 percent of the benefits of cutting capital gains taxes would go not to the wealthy, but to lower- and middle-income taxpayers. They could keep more of what they save and use their capital gains to pay educational, medical and other expenses. 
<p>	Sure, cutting the capital gains tax will benefit manufacturers, retailers and other employers -- those who provide Americans with jobs, and who also may be wealthy as a result of their success. This is all to the good, because the money these people don't pay in taxes will be invested in the economy and create more jobs instead of collecting mold in the pockets of federal bureaucrats. Businesses and households spend their money better than government: When was the last time you bought a $700 hammer?  
<p>	But the capital gains tax isn't just something corporate executives have to deal with. It's what gets slapped on your Uncle Joe when he sells his family business; on your retired grandparents when they sell that nest egg of General Motors stock they've been holding for 40 years; and on your parents when they sell their empty-nest home to live in an apartment. All these legitimate economic gains by middle-class American taxpayers -- many of them elderly -- shouldn't be accompanied by a huge tax bill from Uncle Sam. But they are. And it's not fair. 
<p>	Especially when those who argue against a capital gains tax cut fudge on the number of "rich" people who would benefit. Politicians -- including President Clinton -- commonly distort the numbers by counting the one-time capital gain your grandparents realize on the sale of their old house as if this indicated their normal income level. In other words, if they were collecting $30,000 a year from Social Security and made a one-time $30,000 capital gain from selling their house, they would be counted as a $60,000 a year household for purposes of arguing against cutting the capital gains tax!
<p> 	That's ludicrous. And it gives you an idea of the lengths some people will go to keep America from understanding what will happen when the government stops penalizing success. 
<p>	The truth is that each of America's leading private economic consulting firms -- including DRI/McGraw-Hill, Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates, and Laurence H. Meyer & Associates -- has concluded that balancing the federal budget and cutting taxes at the same time, including the capital gains tax, would result in a stronger, more productive economy. This is precisely the plan President Clinton is opposing.
<p>	For example, one of the most widely respected models of the U.S. economy -- the University of Michigan Quarterly Model -- found that combining a balanced federal budget with tax cuts would produce immediate reductions in interest rates and inflation and an upswing in long-term economic activity. When my colleagues and I at The Heritage Foundation conducted a similar study, we found not only that the economy would surge, but that most of the economic benefits hinged precisely on a cut in the capital gains tax. Without that cut, most of the benefits vanish.
<p>	 The Balanced Budget Act of 1995 would cut in half the amount of money your parents are forced to pay the government when they try to collect their retirement nest egg. It would eliminate the tax liability of 3.5 million poor American families through a $500-per-child tax credit, so they wouldn't have to pay federal taxes at all, directly affecting the well-being of 8 million American children. And it would encourage a booming economy. Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve Board chairman, recently testified before Congress that just the "expectation" of a balanced budget had caused interest rates to drop two percentage points. 
<p>	But instead of admitting that Congress may have something here, and giving middle-class Americans a windfall of economic well-being, President Clinton wants to harp on the tired, class-warfare and envy rhetoric. He continues to present Congress's plan as "tax cuts for the rich." 
<p>	The facts do not support this view.

<title>BEIJING'S AFTERMATH: A CLOSER LOOK AT THE U.N. CONFERENCE</title>

<body>

<center>

<img src="/townhall/FRC/fampol/fampolgn.gif">

<h1>Beijing's Aftermath</h1>
<h2><i>A Closer Look at the U.N. Conference</i></h2>

</center>

<font size=+3>A</font>fter much heated debate prior to and during the 
United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China, the 
final Platform for Action was adopted on September 15, 1995.

<p>

What does the final document say?  And what are the implications of the
document for families, both in America and abroad?  This report
seeks to answer these questions as well as to shed light on the
inner processes surrounding the adoption of the Beijing Platform.

<p>

<center><h3>General Assessment</h3></center>

<p>

The United Nations spent $2.5 million to sponsor the Beijing
conference -- $1.8 million for conference services and $700,000
for public information.  Moreover, China incurred additional expenses
to host the event.  It took 12 days and a half-dozen committees
for the 4,969 delegates representing 189 countries to hammer out
the Beijing Platform for Action -- all the time under constant
pressure from 4,020 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and
the watchful eyes of 3,235 members of the media.

<p>

The Beijing document, written over the course of two years, primarily
by NGOs from the old-line radical women's movement in collaboration
with several U.N. staff, arrived in Beijing with one third of
its text in brackets to show it was under challenge by various
government delegates.  (Brackets denoted areas of the text which
were disputed by government delegates.  No brackets could remain
in the final document.)

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
What the feminists wanted<br>
from the Beijing conference<br>
was a redefinition of 'woman'<br>
in the radical feminist mold.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The document that emerged from Beijing was an unwieldy mixture
of ideas, reflecting, in part, the many different factions represented.
But by far, this &quot;agenda for women's empowerment&quot; was
most heavily influenced by radical feminists advocating a &quot;gender
perspective.&quot;  In fact, several prominent national delegations
were led by radical feminists -- notably those from the United States,
Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Caribbean and the European
Union.  These delegations demonstrated their determination to
extend international recognition of women's reproductive &quot;rights&quot;
beyond the Cairo Conference of 1994.

<p>

What the feminists wanted from the Beijing conference was a redefinition
of &quot;woman&quot; in the radical feminist mold.  They wanted
the U.N. to declare that women had a universal right to abortion
and that abortion was an acceptable means of family planning.
They wanted to enshrine the &quot;rights&quot; of adolescents
to information and medical services where sex and AIDS were concerned,
without the &quot;interference&quot; of parents.  They wanted
an endorsement of &quot;sexual orientation&quot; as an entree
for lesbian &quot;rights&quot; and, short of that, they wanted
the phrase &quot;in all its various forms&quot; appended to all
mentions of &quot;the family&quot; in the document, so as to make
way for non-traditional unions.

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

What the feminists ended up with was something in between.  Abortion
was not declared a universal right nor accepted as a means of
family planning in the Platform.  However, controlling one's sexual 
and reproductive activity was declared
a &quot;human right.&quot;  Parents' rights were not completely
overruled, but they were subordinated to &quot;the best interests
of the child.&quot; Lesbian &quot;rights&quot; language was finally excluded 
at 4:45 a.m. the day scheduled for the adoption of the document, as weary
delegates looking for a few hours of sleep simply deleted all
references to sexual orientation from the document.  Nonetheless,
as Main Committee Chair Patricia Licuanan pointed out, this did
not change the fact that the day before, for the first time, a
lesbian had addressed a U.N. plenary on behalf of lesbian &quot;rights.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>Issues in the Beijing Document</h3></center>

<p>

It must be acknowledged that the Beijing document contains some
positive aspects in that it denounces many terrible injustices
still suffered by women -- especially women in the Third World.
For example, the Platform denounces societies where son-preference
is practiced.  It spotlights poverty as a cause of women's suffering.
It condemns domestic battering and harassment in the workplace
and denounces forced prostitution, pornography, female genital
mutilation, bride-burning, sexual slavery and forced sterilization.
It condemns rape, especially as a weapon of war.

<p>

Still, as critics have pointed out, the document cultivates a
terrible moral and philosophic blindness to the human dignity
of women.  In many ways, the document is a monument to the &quot;exaggerated
individualism&quot; which characterizes the radical feminist movement.
It sees the role of wife and mother as impediments to a woman's
self-realization while refusing to recognize the harms, such as
disease and poverty, that are caused by irresponsible sexual behavior.

<p>

To take the issues in the Beijing document one by one:

<p>

<h4>1. Women's Roles</h4>

<p>

Despite the fact that 70 percent of the world's women are wives
and mothers, the Beijing document barely considers them in this
capacity.  Positive comments on women in connection with the family
are stuffed into a single paragraph (number 30), which reads:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

&quot;Women play a critical role in the family.  The family is
the basic unit of society and as such should be strengthened.
It is entitled to receive comprehensive protection and support.
In different cultural, political and social systems, various
forms of the family exist.  The rights, capabilities and responsibilities
of family members must be respected.  Women make a great contribution
to the welfare of the family and to the development of society,
which is still not recognized or considered in its full importance.
The social significance of maternity, motherhood, and the role
of parents in the family and in the upbringing of children should
be acknowledged.  Maternity, motherhood, parenting and the role
of women in procreation must not be a basis for discrimination
nor restrict the full participation of women in society.  Recognition
should also be given to the important role often played by women in many 
countries in caring for other members of their family.&quot;

</i>

</blockquote><p>

This paragraph is one of the few passages in the document which
speaks of women in connection with the family.  Another mention
(barely a nod) is paragraph 245b which urges that women's life
experiences, &quot;including, but not limited to their experiences
of balancing work and family responsibilities as mothers, as professionals,
as managers and entrepreneurs,&quot; be included in media depictions.

<p>

Elsewhere in the document, marriage is mentioned in a negative
way as, for example, in the context of dowry problems.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<font size=+1><b><i>
Parents' rights were not<br>
completely overruled, but<br>
they were subordinated to<br>
'the best interests of the<br>
child.'
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<h4>2. The Family</h4>

<p>

While the March, 1995 Copenhagen Programme devoted an entire
section to &quot;the family,&quot; and the September, 1994 Cairo
Plan of Action included a chapter on &quot;the family,&quot; the
Beijing Platform for Action, the U.N.'s longest document discussing
women, almost completely ignores the subject. The only mention
of &quot;the family&quot; of any length in the Beijing Platform
of Action is in the same paragraph 30, mentioned above.

<p>

Before it begins discussing &quot;motherhood,&quot; that paragraph
says: &quot;The family is the basic unit of society and as such
should be strengthened.  It is entitled to receive comprehensive
protection and support.  In different cultural, political and
social systems, various forms of the family exist. The rights,
capabilities and responsibilities of family members must be respected....
The upbringing of children requires shared responsibility of parents,
women and men and society as a whole.&quot;

<p>

Paragraph 30 was one of the most hotly debated sections in the
document.  From the first preparatory committee meeting in Jakarta,
pro-life delegates struggled to guarantee language acknowledging
the importance of the family (in its traditional sense) both in
the lives of women and to society at large, as stated in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights (1948).  Feminists, on the other hand,
insisted on using the phrase &quot;the family in all its forms&quot;
to allow for homosexual unions.  A compromise sentence -- &quot;In
different cultural, political and social systems, various forms
of the family exist&quot; -- was added in Beijing to take into
account the existence of single-parent families and extended families.
Even this compromise sentence, however, could be misinterpreted
to condone homosexual unions.  It could also leave the door open
for &quot;the whole village&quot; (or more precisely, the state)
to direct the upbringing of children.

<p>

&quot;Family&quot; is mentioned again (cursorily) in the Beijing
document (paragraph 93) as one responsibility among many in a
woman's life.  It is mentioned in paragraph 285, where the document
speaks of the family's role in promoting the equality of the 
&quot;girl-child&quot; and in paragraph 108c, where men are encouraged 
&quot;to share equally in childcare and household work and to provide 
financial support for their families even if they do not live with 
them.&quot; The few other mentions of &quot;family&quot; in the document
are very negative.  In paragraph 114a, for example, the family
is mentioned as the venue for battering, sexual abuse, marital
rape, female genital mutilation, and other acts of violence against
women.

<p>

<h4>3. Women's Health</h4>

<p>

The women's health section is the longest and one of the most
troubling.  It begins rhapsodically, with the statement, &quot;Women
have the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard
of physical and mental health... Health is a state of complete
physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence
of disease or infirmity&quot; (paragraph 91).  To this it adds
(repeating Cairo) in paragraph 96: &quot;Reproductive health is
a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and
not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, in all matters
relating to the reproductive system and to its functions and 
processes.&quot;

<p>

To the point of neglecting most health problems, the document
concentrates on sexual or reproductive health.  AIDS alone gets
roughly 20 paragraphs, whereas cardiac disease and cancer are
mentioned only once or twice.  The document almost completely
ignores the problem of tropical disease which decimates female
populations in the Third World.

<p>

<h4>4. Reproductive Rights</h4>

<p>

The Beijing Declaration (paragraph 17) asserts that &quot;[t]he
explicit recognition and reaffirmation of the right of all women
to control all aspects of their health, in particular their own
fertility, is basic to their empowerment.&quot;

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Lesbian 'rights' language<br>
was finally excluded as<br>
weary delegates looking<br>
for a few hours of sleep<br>
deleted all references<br>
to sexual orientation<br>
from the document.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

But the most stunning part of the Platform is its pronouncement
that women have a &quot;human right&quot; to control their own
sexuality and reproduction.  Paragraph 97 of the health section
declares that: &quot;The human rights of women include their right
to have control over and decide freely and responsibly on matters
related to their sexuality, including sexual and reproductive 
health.&quot;

<p>

Raising a woman's right to control her own sexuality and reproduction
to a &quot;human right&quot; is a considerable step beyond the
1993 Vienna Programme of Action's statement that &quot;reproductive
rights rest on the recognition of the basic right of all couples
and individuals to decide freely and responsibly the number, spacing
and timing of their children and to have the information and means
to do so.&quot;  It is also a considerable step beyond Cairo's
similar statement on the subject.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
The Beijing document<br>
contains some positive<br>
aspects: it denounces<br>
forced prostitution,<br>
pornography, genital<br>
mutilation, bride-burning,<br>
sexual slavery and forced<br>
sterilization. It condemns<br>
rape, expecially as a<br>
weapon of war.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The 1994 Cairo document had asserted that &quot;reproductive
rights embrace certain human rights that are already recognized
in national laws, international human rights documents and other
relevant U.N. consensus documents.&quot;  Moreover, the Beijing
Plan of Action had originally labelled controlling one's own fertility
&quot;a sexual right,&quot; but not &quot;a human right.&quot;
A woman's &quot;human right&quot; to control her sexual and reproductive
health could be understood to mean that she has a &quot;human
right&quot; to promiscuity, homosexuality and to abortion.

<p>

When this language was adopted in committee on September 10,
the Holy See was very concerned by what it saw as the invention
of a new &quot;human right.&quot;  At the conference and, more
recently, in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> (September 21, 1995),
the Holy See delegation chief Mary Ann Glendon, an American and
professor of law at Harvard University, protested the Conference's
tampering with the Universal Declaration. &quot;All this is 
evidence,&quot; she said, &quot;of the increasing colonization of the 
great Universal Human Rights tradition by an impoverished U.S.-style 
libertarian rights dialectic whose features are (1) rights envisioned without 
corresponding individual or social responsibilities; (2) one's favorite 
rights (i.e., speech, property, etc.) touted as absolute while other
rights are ignored; (3) the rights-bearer is imagined as radically
autonomous and self-sufficient; and (4) the creation of new rights
which are often in conflict with one another (e.g., the right
to smoke versus a clean environment).&quot;

<p>

<h4>5. Abortion</h4>

<p>

Besides the disturbing paragraph 97, the Beijing document makes
no new inroads in promoting the legality of abortion.  Repeating
Cairo, the document says (paragraph 107k), &quot;In no case should
abortion be promoted as a means of family planning.&quot;  But
due to the precedent set at the 1994 Cairo conference, the term
&quot;reproductive rights&quot; in U.N. documents must now always
be understood to imply abortion in those countries where abortion
has been legalized.  Indeed, paragraph 107k continues by saying,
&quot;In circumstances where abortion is not against the law,
such abortions should be safe.&quot;

<p>

Despite the protests of pro-life delegates at both Cairo and
Beijing that abortion is never &quot;safe&quot; for the baby in
question, the Beijing document repeatedly condemns &quot;unsafe
abortions&quot; (which it defines as &quot;a procedure for terminating
an unwanted pregnancy either by persons lacking necessary skills
or in an environment lacking minimum medical standards&quot;).
For example, paragraph 95 lists &quot;unsafe abortion&quot; among
the consequences of early sexual experience, and paragraph 98
says that &quot;[u]nsafe abortions threaten the lives of a number
of women, presenting a serious public health problem.&quot; 
Paragraph 107k asks governments &quot;to deal with the health impact
of unsafe abortions as a major public health concern and to reduce
the recourse to abortions by increasing and improving family planning
services.&quot;

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
The document is a monument<br>
to the 'exaggerated<br>
individualism' which<br>
characterizes the radical<br>
feminist movement.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

During the negotiations in Beijing, the draft document's several
mentions of unborn life were either struck down or severely weakened.
In each instance where the document formerly mentioned &quot;female
foeticide&quot; (paragraphs 40 ,41, 115bis, etc.), the term was
replaced by &quot;prenatal sex selection.&quot;  But paragraph
276c which condemns son preference and unethical practices such
as prenatal sex selection and female infanticide, still adds,
&quot;This is often compounded by the increasing use of technologies
to determine fetal sex resulting in the abortion of female fetuses.&quot;

<p>

Also notable is paragraph 107k which calls on states to &quot;consider
reviewing laws containing punitive measures against women who
have undergone illegal abortions.&quot;  This paragraph also states,
&quot;Prevention of unwanted pregnancies must always be given
the highest priority, and every attempt should be made to eliminate
the need for abortion.  Any measures or changes related to abortion
within the health system can only be determined at the national
or local level according to the national legislative process.&quot;
(Given the restrictions on pro-life legislation in this country,
one has to wonder whether the U.S. is in compliance with this
language.)

<p>

Paragraph 107k also states, &quot;In all cases, women should
have access to quality services for the management of complications 
arising from abortion.  Post-abortion counseling, education and 
family-planning services should be offered promptly, which will also 
help to avoid repeat abortions.&quot;

<p>

<h4>6. Parents' Responsibility for Children</h4>

<p>

Despite the fact that Article 26 of the United Nations' Universal
Declaration of Human Rights states, &quot;Parents have a prior
right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their
children,&quot; the Beijing document hardly acknowledges parental
authority over children.  Indeed, at least 17 references to parental
responsibility for children were deleted from the draft document.

<p>

For example, there is no longer any reference to parents' rights
in paragraph 107m, which asks governments to &quot;[e]nsure that
girls have continuing access to necessary health and nutrition
information and services, as they mature, to facilitate a healthy
transition from childhood to adulthood.&quot;

<p>

Parental rights language was also removed from paragraph 109(1),
which approves condom use for male adolescents.  (Moreover, despite
strong objections voiced by Catholic and Muslim delegates, a paragraph
asking governments to &quot;encourage abstinence as responsible
behavior until marriage&quot; was swiftly discarded at the Beijing
conference, at the urging of the Canadian delegation.)

<font size=+1><b><i>
Despite the fact that 70<br>

women are wives and mothers,<br>
the Beijing document barely<br>
considers them in this capacity.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The only vestige of parental responsibility which remains in
the document relates to the &quot;direction and guidance&quot;
of children.  But this weak language still disregards parents,
leaving most decision-making responsibilities to the child, including
(possibly) the decision of abortion.

<p>

In the end, the key paragraph relating to parents' rights and
children's rights turned out to be paragraph 267.  This  paragraph
reads:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

&quot;The International Conference on Population and Development
recognized, in paragraph 7.3 of the Programme of Action, that
'full attention should be given to the promotion of mutually respectful
and equitable gender relations and particularly to meeting the
educational and service needs of adolescents to enable them to
deal in a positive and responsible way with their sexuality,'
taking into account the rights of the child to access to information,
privacy, confidentiality, respect and informed consent, as well
as the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents and legal
guardians to provide, in a manner consistent with the evolving
capacities of the child, appropriate direction and guidance in
the exercise by the child of the rights recognized in the Convention
on the Rights of the Child, and in conformity with the Convention
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.
In all actions concerning children, the best interests of the
child shall be a primary consideration.  Support should be given
to integral sexual education for young people with parental support
and guidance that stress the responsibility of males for their
own sexuality and fertility and that help them exercise their
responsibilities.&quot;

</i>

</blockquote><p>

Paragraph 108e  (about public health campaigns) takes the same
position, asking governments to:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

&quot;Prepare and disseminate accessible information...to ensure
that men and women, especially young people, can acquire knowledge about 
their health and especially information about sexuality and reproduction, 
taking into account the rights of the child to access to information,
privacy, confidentiality, respect and informed consent, as well
as the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents and legal
guardians to provide, in a manner consistent with the evolving
capacities of the child, appropriate direction and guidance in
the exercise by the child of the rights recognized in the Convention
on the Rights of the Child, and in conformity with the Convention
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.
In all actions concerning children, the best interests of the
child shall be a primary concern.&quot;

</i>

</blockquote><p>

<p>

<h4>7. Religion</h4>

<p>

There is only one paragraph in the Platform for Action dedicated
to the role of religion in women's lives. This paragraph (25bis),
which in its original form cast religion as oppressive to women
(i.e., associating it with extremism and violence), was reworked
to acknowledge that freedom of conscience and religion are recognized
by the Universal Declaration.

<p>

Paragraph 25bis now reads:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

&quot;Religion, spirituality and belief play a central role in the 
lives of millions of women and men -- in the way they live, in the 
aspirations that they have for the future. The right to freedom of 
thought, conscience and religion is unalienable
and must be universally enjoyed.  This right includes the freedom
to have or to adopt the religion or belief of their choice, either
individually or in community with others, in public or in private,
and to manifest their religion or belief in worship, observance,
practice and teaching, in order to realize equality, development
and peace there is a need to fully respect these rights and freedoms.
Religion, thought, conscience and belief may, and can, contribute
to fulfilling women's and men's moral, ethical and spiritual needs,
and to realizing their full potential in society.  However, it
is acknowledged that any form of extremism may have a negative
impact on women and can lead to violence and discrimination.&quot;

</i>

</blockquote>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
The most stunning part<br>
of the Platform is its<br>
pronouncement that women<br>
have a 'human right' to<br>
control their own reproduction.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Within the Beijing Declaration, paragraph 12 includes &quot;the
right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion and belief,
thus contributing to the moral, ethical, spiritual and intellectual
needs of women and men&quot; among rights to be protected.  And
on occasion, the document also appends a phrase such as &quot;consistent
with religious and cultural values&quot; (paragraphs 74, 82f)
to qualify injunctions to action.
<p>

<center><h3>Concluding the Conference</h3></center>

<p>

The Platform for Action was hotly argued for twelve days, sometimes
long into the night.  Negotiations about sexual and reproductive
rights as human rights went on sporadically for three days. Canada's 
Ruth Archibald led the five-day drive to remove the document's 17 
references to parental rights.

<p>

But by far the most important and moving proceeding for pro-family
advocates came during the four-hour marathon following the formal
adoption of the Platform on September 15th in which 42 U.N. member
states registered reservations to the Platform.  (These 42 comprised
a full fifth of the organization's membership, not what critics
had at one time called &quot;a handful of Latin American and Moslem
states.&quot;)

<p>

These reservations were especially important because they countered
the claims made by members of the U.S. delegation -- Tim Wirth,
Geraldine Ferraro, Donna Shalala, and health negotiators Nils
Daulaire and Dottie Lamm -- who, throughout the conference, kept
insisting that things were going smoothly.  The reservations also
served to refute the networks, the <I>New York Times</I> and Ford
Foundation representative Frances Kissling (Catholics for a Free
Choice), who, in a consistent stream of disinformation, claimed
that the Vatican was caving in on contraceptives and condoms.

<p>

Announcing its reservations at the conference, the Holy See opted
out of the health section in its entirety, on the grounds that
it concentrated on sexual and reproductive health to the point
of almost failing to address other women's health needs, including
maternal mortality and morbidity. It objected to ambiguous terms
concerning unqualified control over sexuality and fertility which
might be interpreted as an endorsement of abortion and homosexuality.
With regard to the whole human rights section, the Holy See associated
itself with very little besides the quotations from existing human 
rights documents.  It asked that its definition of the word 
&quot;gender&quot;(biological sexual identity: male or female) be affixed 
to the document when it was printed.

<p>

Islamic states clarified that, for them, sexual rights apply
only within marriage, and that they had not agreed to anything
condoning abortion.  Several stressed that the Platform for Action
would be interpreted in their countries according to Sharia (Islamic)
law, especially in regard to inheritance for girls.  The Philippines
objected to treating reproductive rights as human rights.

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Malaysia said it would interpret &quot;family&quot; in the document
as the traditional family, and Ecuador said that the family is
the fundamental unit of society.  When the delegate from Niger
prepared to enter her reservation, she said publicly what many
developing country delegates had said earlier in private, &quot;We
hope that joining in the consensus will not be a pre-condition
for [donors'] financing of health programs.&quot;

<p>

In its final statement to the conference, the U.S. stressed its
commitment to the cause of women's empowerment and declared that
the Beijing Platform for Action would serve as a detailed map
for achieving women's equality, development and peace.  However,
neither the United States nor any of the other donor countries who so 
strongly backed the document have promised any new money for women's 
programs. They insisted that no new resources could be provided, turning
down the African and Latin American delegates who contended that
new and additional resources were needed to provide basic health
care to women, which was, for them, the overriding concern of
the conference.

<p>

<center><h3>Beijing's Implications</h3></center>

<p>

There is no doubt that the Beijing document will have consequences
for the family.  A year after Cairo, the first global survey made
by the U.N. examining its membership's progress to fulfill the
promises made in that conference's Plan of Action showed that
out of 53 nations surveyed, 46 have undertaken new policies to
implement the Cairo document.  The other seven nations were recorded
either as having lost ground in implementing the document or stayed
the same.  The U.N. Population Fund has also recently announced
that it increased its budget almost 21 percent in 1994 and another
17.6 percent in 1995, to a total of $312 million.  And plans are
already being considered for another U.N. women's meeting in 2000
and for a declaration of &quot;The Century of Women.&quot;

<p>

While the Beijing conference yielded few high points, one positive
result is that it drew together pro-family, conservative women
who for so long had resisted dealing with the U.N. due to their
general distaste for the organization.  In 1994, there were perhaps
two openly pro-life organizations among the NGOs at the U.N.,
but as recently as last April's PrepCom, there were 50.  The conference
in Beijing -- a long and very expensive journey from the US without
government or U.N. assistance -- drew over 200 women from close
to 150 conservative NGO organizations from 20 countries, including
Protestants, Catholics, Muslims and others.

<p>

Despite their late entrance and the fact that the feminists had
written most of the document, pro-family women became an important
part of the proceedings and undid a good deal of the damage that
preceded their arrival.  They supported pro-family delegates,
long-used to jeering and mockery.  They made the case for family
values on talk radio shows at home, telephoning from Beijing.
They even assisted delegates confused by inadequate U.N. translations,
patiently explaining code words like &quot;orientation&quot; and
&quot;gender&quot; to Third World delegates.  (Many Africans thought
that &quot;reproductive rights&quot; meant the right to have a
family.)

<p>

Most of all, these pro-family women were able to challenge U.S.
delegates on their partisanship, their lack of responsiveness
to the public, and their dearth of fidelity to traditional human
rights.  When the U.S. unfurled a banner demonstrating how closely
its commitments matched those of WEDO (a radical feminist NGO
led by Bella Abzug), conservative women raised another banner
made from a hotel bedsheet, pointing out where the U.S. had covered
its ears to conservative women.  So uncomfortable did the U.S.
delegation finally become with these new lobbyists that they called
in U.N. security guards to confiscate the conservatives' passes.

<title>Chic Prejudice -- Heritage Commentary</title>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">

<center>
<h3>Chic Prejudice</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
January 26, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
	Each year in homes across America anxious parents and high school students undergo the 
familiar ritual of trying to decide which college or university to attend. In recent years, several 
widely-respected national magazines have helped spawn a small cottage industry that rates the 
best of the nation's institutions of higher learning.
<P>	One of the most widely-read of these surveys is the one compiled by the <i>U.S. News & 
World Report</i>. Another is a survey offered by <i>Money Magazine</i>. While <i>U.S. 
News</i> offers what I think is a rather objective analysis, the same cannot be said for 
<i>Money Magazine</i>'s recently published 9th annual college survey. 
<p>	I suppose I shouldn't be surprised to find explicit anti-religious bias in the Money survey. 
 After all, the magazine is owned by Time Warner, Inc., whose corporate leaders take a long time 
to learn why they shouldn't publish murderous song lyrics by hoodlum "artists." And the U.S. 
media in general have been under fire for years for religious bias they apparently consider 
permissible, even chic.
<p>	But I was outraged when I heard <i>Money</i>'s response to a complaint from Thomas 
J. Savage, president of Jesuit-run Rockhurst College in Kansas City, Mo., which was 
purposefully excluded from the 1996 <i>Money</i> survey, having been included in 1995. As 
Jillian Kasky, <i>Money</i>'s associate editor for statistics, wrote back to Savage: "We exclude 
colleges whose primary purpose is to turn out members of the clergy, colleges that require an 
affirmation of faith from students, colleges where the curriculum or extracurricular activities 
significantly reflect the ideology of a specific faith, and colleges where religious study of any 
nature is a significant academic requirement."
<p>	On its face, this is a perplexing standard. Why should a college -- any college -- that 
seeks to produce people of high moral character and fortified personal religious beliefs be  left 
out of such an important survey? How is it that other Catholic schools such as Georgetown 
University -- also run by the Jesuits -- and the University of Notre Dame made the survey while 
Rockhurst and other lesser-known schools did not? 
<p>	This begins to look like prejudice of the worst kind: the kind that falsely bows and 
scrapes before the high and mighty while sticking it to the little guy. 
<p>	Such prejudice is also ignorant, both of the place of religion in education and of its 
history in the United States. After all, all education used to be religious education -- run by 
clergy, the most highly educated class in any Western society. Many of America's best-known 
colleges, Harvard University among them, began with the sole purpose of educating men for the 
clergy. None of this was seen as inconsistent with the highest intellectual standards. Why? 
Because it wasn't. 
<P>	A fact unknown in the chic salons of Time Warner and the high and mighty media 
newsrooms is that today many scientists see a lot more room for belief in a Creator -- as a result 
of 20th-century discoveries in quantum physics, astrophysics, molecular biology and many other 
disciplines -- than did their 19th-century counterparts.  As Henry Margenau, retired Yale 
professor of  physics and natural philosophy and a colleague of Albert Einstein, told a friend of 
mine a few years ago, "High school science teachers, Carl Sagan, people like that -- they still 
carry around the old bias against religion. But to the real scientists -- the ones making the 
discoveries -- religion no longer poses a problem for them."  
<p>	There are still a few parents and students in this country who choose a college for reasons 
other than its proximity to pubs, beaches, malls or nightclubs. With the frightening decline in 
standards, values and civility ripping at America's moral and social fabric, colleges that offer 
students moral, as well as practical instruction still rank high on many families' lists.
<p>
	Too bad they don't even show up on <i>Money Magazine</i>'s list.

<h3>SPECIAL INTERESTS STILL GET YOUR MONEY</h3>
<a href="/heritage/staff/wittmann.htm">Marshall Wittmann</a> and Charles P. Griffin<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
January 18, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%>

	Washington loves to wring its hands over a complex problem few people understand, 
enact reforms that don't really solve it, and then crow about having made the world a better place 
when election time rolls around. This is exactly what will happen as a result of a "reform" 
enacted last year ostensibly to end taxpayer-subsidized lobbying and political activity.
<p>	The problem, in a nutshell, is this: There are many special-interest lobbying groups that 
get much of their funding from you, the taxpayer. Instead of finding out whether you agree with 
their cause and asking for a contribution, these groups take the lucrative shortcut of going to 
Congress. They convince lawmakers to grant large sums to certain programs and then sign up to 
receive funding through those same programs. In effect, they've found a way to get your money 
whether you agree with their cause or not.
<p>	It's easy to muddy debate over such a problem with dire predictions of suffering and 
mayhem if this or that group is no longer able to raid the public trough. So, the public is rarely 
permitted to see the real issue clearly. But this time around, the debate became clear enough that 
even lawmakers -- and lobbyists -- worried about a backlash. They enacted a reform that seemed 
to do something about taxpayer-funded lobbying. Only problem is, they left open a loophole 
wide enough to drive a busful of lobbyists through. 
<p>	Under the new law, big lobbying groups like the National Council of Senior Citizens 
(NCSC) and the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), known by their tax-code 
designation of 501(c)4, may no longer receive federal grants or contracts, since the Internal 
Revenue Code states that these groups may engage in an unlimited amount of lobbying. Both the 
NCSC and AARP currently benefit from $70 million to $80 million in taxpayers' money each 
year, amounting to 96 percent and 20 percent of their budgets, respectively.
<p>	But the measure doesn't prevent these groups from simply forming 501(c)3 charitable 
organizations which can accept federal money. In fact, both the AARP and NCSC already have 
such affiliated groups. No wonder the defenders of welfare for lobbyists launched no opposition 
to the new lobbying reform provision. They understood it was not a threat. 
<p>	Unfortunately, this isn't the only problem with the new law. For example, the reform 
focused solely on 501(c)4 lobbying groups, while ignoring labor unions and other big taxpayer-
funded groups such as Planned Parenthood, which represent a significant share of the existing 
abuse. The simple fact is that no special-interest group that engages in lobbying or political 
activity should be subsidized by the taxpayers. The question isn't whether or not the causes these 
groups espouse are just, or whether or not you agree with them. The question is whether all 
Americans should be forced to pay for them, whether they want to or not.
<p>	This isn't a liberal vs. conservative issue. The American people are a diverse population 
with differing political views. To force hard-working taxpayers to contribute to political causes 
they may abhor is wrong. It is just as bad to fund the NCSC, the AFL-CIO, or Planned 
Parenthood -- three major offenders --  as it would be to send grants to the National Rifle 
Association or Christian Coalition.	
<p>	The new year brings new opportunities for Congress to end these abuses. For example, 
the appropriations committees should examine programs like the Labor Department's Senior 
Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP) that serve as slush funds for lobbyists. The 
SCSEP provides $320 million (out of a $400 million allotment) to just nine lobbying groups like 
NCSC and AARP to subsidize their operations.
<p>	Congress should compel witnesses testifying before congressional committees to divulge 
any federal funding they receive. In addition, Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind., has suggested a "Let 
America Know Amendment" that would force taxpayer-subsidized groups to disclose the extent 
of their political advocacy. Both of these reforms would go a long way toward increasing 
awareness of this vitally important issue.
<p>	But most important, Congress should close off any and all avenues and loopholes by 
which lobbying groups can receive taxpayer funding. This should be high on the list of 
unfinished business this year.

<HR>
06-November-1995

<P> 
 
 
<P> I CONFESS that I love a guy in uniform, but the appeal of the military man of the moment is wearing thin. 
Colin Powell is flirting with the nation and the GOP. But will he respect them after the election?
<P> Powell will announce his political intentions next month, and Washington prognosticators are evenly 
divided over whether or not he'll toss his helmet into the ring. Some Powell watchers are convinced that his 
innate caution will dictate enjoyment of his new prosperity and privacy rather than entry into the mean 
world of presidential politics. Others believe the rumor that Powell has hired a Republican polling firm and 
intends to announce his candidacy on Veterans' Day, in time to make a big splash in the November 18 straw 
poll in Florida.
<P> If General Powell does decide to enter the Republican race, what kind of Republican will he be? His 
popular image is of someone who had to do it all himself, overcoming the obstacles of poverty and a racist 
society through intelligence and gumption. Powell did work hard, and deserves respect. But as
<i>My 
American Journey </i>candidly reveals, his childhood was far more secure and comfortable than, say, Phil 
Gramm's. Powell was raised by loving, middle-class parents in the South Bronx of the Forties, a far cry 
from the living hell that is the South Bronx in the Nineties. He grew up in a racially mixed, harmonious 
neighborhood, and went to City College in New York at a time when academic standards were high and 
racial separatism was not preached. Powell's justifiable pride owes no debt to an Afrocentric curriculum.
<p> Politically, however, Powell has shown little appreciation for the lessons to be drawn from the differences 
between life in pre-Balkanized New York and life in the racially tense city of today. Indeed, in the wake of 
the O.J. verdict, he has shown an uncharacteristic clumsiness in handling racial issues. 
The O.J. verdict 
itself, Powell says, ``shows that the judicial system works.'' And though the sense of self-preservation he 
developed in the Army prevented him from joining Louis Farrakhan's march in Washington, he at first 
pleaded a schedule conflict rather than refusing straightforwardly to attend  -- an evasion that was all too 
transparent. Willing to offend conservatives (he is ``disturbed by the class and racial undertones beneath the 
surface of [their] rhetoric''), he seemed wary of taking on the outspokenly bigoted Farrakhan.
More generally, Powell has tacked left and right as his political interests have dictated. Until a week or two 
ago, he was expressing liberal social views; he stated his opposition to a Balanced Budget Amendment, and 
declared the Contract with America ``a little too hard, a little too harsh, a little too unkind.'' He called 
conservatives ``Neanderthals.'' His few genuflections in a conservative direction were vague tributes to the 
family and fiscal restraint, without any particular policy agenda, rather as if Bill Clinton had stepped up to 
the Republican mike. Indeed, he frankly said that ``neither of the two major parties fits me comfortably in 
its present state.'' 
<P> How did he choose which party to flirt with? He explained that the Democratic Party ``is not alive and well 
like the Republican Party is.'' Instead of rescutitating the Democrats, however, he seems more interested in 
tailoring the GOP to his own measure. But first he has to capture it. He duly tacked rightwards in an 
interview with Le Figaro. Suddenly the Contract with America was marked by ``energy, life, and a will to 
change.'' Even Newt Gingrich came in for a compliment. As for Powell himself, he pronounced himself 
``slightly to the right of center.''
<p> Initially, this may well work. As several polls have demonstrated, there is probably a larger popular 
audience for Powell than there is for his establishment opinions, including among GOP primary voters. But 
this popularity makes Powell a very valuable resource to those who do agree with his views. And who might 
they be? Over the past few months, says Powell, he has become aware of plenty of Rockefeller Republicans 
who have been ``somewhat silent.'' 
<p> Now, liberal Republican committee chairmen on Capitol Hill may not have had time to talk to Colin Powell, 
but their ``voice'' is being heard loud and clear. They have been working feverishly to derail the 
conservative revolution. Is it, then, the rank-and-file Rockefeller Republicans to whom Powell intends to 
give a voice? If he has met large numbers of them, he must have spent the summer in Connecticut or Rhode 
Island. And any impression that they represent the country's Republican voters is unlikely to be dislodged 
by his book tour, where he reportedly signs a thousand books an hour with barely a glance at the grateful 
purchaser, before he's off to his next star-struck press interview.
<p> SO, IF he were to enter the Republican primaries, Colin Powell would be undertaking the political mission 
of transforming a vibrant, conservative GOP into a pre-1964-style progressive GOP. Since Clinton's 
election, 142 Democratic officeholders have switched to the Republican Party. There are a record number 
of Democratic retirements from the Senate, and when the Republicans succeed in delivering on their 
agenda, there will be a boatload of Democrats retiring from the House. The current state of the GOP should 
suggest another maxim for Powell to add to his famous list of rules: ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it.''
<p> But Colin Powell seems to believe that a fix is needed. He ignores the success of the conservative coalition. 
Having operated for years in official Washington, he appears to have internalized liberal orthodoxy on the 
permissible limits of political discourse. 
<p> But the Republican Party might not be the only casualty if Powell runs. He is currently enjoying the 
admiration of the nation. But would the Powell legend survive a run for the Presidency that pitted him not 
only against Bill Clinton, but also against the dominant conservative wing of the GOP? And all on behalf of 
the country-clubbers, of whom there were few in the Bronx, the Army, or even the Reagan White House.  --

<title>ON DRUGS: THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S CURIOUS SURRENDER</title>

<h1>On Drugs</h1>
<h2><i>The Clinton Administration's Curious Surrender</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>D</font>rug abuse among teenagers has risen significantly 
in recent years.  A nationwide survey by the National Institute on Drug 
Abuse (NIDA) found that between 1991 and 1994 annual marijuana use rose
from 6.2 percent to 13.0 percent among 8th graders, from 16.5 percent to 
30.4 percent among 10th	graders, and from 36.7 percent to 38.2 percent 
among 12th graders. Moreover, cocaine, crack, heroin, and LSD use among 
teenagers is also rising and may soon rival the high rates of the 1970s.[1]

<p>

Despite these trends, the Clinton Administration is leading an all-out 
retreat in the drug war. During the past two years, President Clinton 
has overseen the wholesale dismantling of government agencies that are at 
least partly responsible for the successes of the 1980s. The Clinton 
Administration has:

<p><ul>

<li>Dropped the drug war as one of the National Security Council's top 
priorities. It is now number 29 of 29.[2]

<p>

<li>Cut the drug czar's office by 80 percent from 146 to 25 personnel. 
It was partially restored by Congressional mandate.[3]

<p>

<li>Folded the State Department's Office of International Narcotics 
Matters into a potpourri organization that handles issues like labor, 
environment and population concerns.[4]

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<ul>

<li>Left two key anti-drug positions vacant for at least six months: the 
drug czar and the position of Assistant Secretary of Defense for Drug 
Enforcement Policy and Support.[5]

<p>

<li>Cut military anti-drug efforts by signing an executive order 
drastically reducing the Pentagon's interdiction efforts. These cuts 
included 1,000 military positions devoted to anti-drug activities,[6] a 
move Rep. Charles Schumer (D-NY) called "a terrible mistake."[7]

<p>
	
<li>Cut drug interdiction funds for the Customs Service and the DEA. 
Today,	even though 70 percent of all cocaine comes to the U.S. via Mexico, 
the Customs Service does not routinely search for drugs inside semi-trailers 
crossing the border.[8]

<p>

<li>Reduced mandatory minimum sentences for drug traffickers.[9]

<p>

<li>Recommended, during his first-year budget, cuts in drug education 
(26 percent) and enforcement (15 percent).[10] Drug Czar Lee Brown learned 
of the proposed	cuts from an article in a newspaper.[11]

<p>

<li>Recommended merging the DEA with the FBI as part of the National 
Performance Review.[12]

<p>

<li>Cut 355 DEA agents and 102 personnel from the Justice Department's 
organized crime drug enforcement task force.[13]

<p>

<li>Cut the Coast Guard's drug interdiction budget by $14.6 million.[14]

<p>

<li>Terminated the DEA's drug kingpin program, which tracks international 
drug lords with the intent of bringing them to justice.

<p>

<li>Published a	report endorsing needle exchange programs intended to 
reduce the spread of AIDS and encouraged local governments to begin needle 
exchange programs.

not abated.[15]

<p>

<li>Cut drug treatment and prevention budgets by $100 and $130 million 
respectively.[16]

<p>

<li>Disbanded Operation Snow-Cap, which assigned DEA agents to assist 
anti-drug police in cocaine-producing nations.

</ul><p>

<center><h3>Bearing Responsibility</h3></center>

<p>

While it is certainly appropriate for policymakers to make changes that 
will improve the effectiveness of legitimate government programs (and these 
changes	will sometimes take the form of budget cuts, departmental 
consolidation and new priorities) a growing number of experts believe the 
Clinton Administration's drug policy changes are at least partly responsible 
for the recent increase in youth drug use and addiction.  For example, former 
First Lady Nancy Reagan told a Congressional committee in March 1995, "Why is 
it we no longer hear the drumbeat of condemnation against drugs coming from 
our leaders and our culture?  Is it any	wonder drug use has started climbing 
and dramatically so?"[17]

<p>

Former drug czar William Bennett stated, there is "no viable effort by the 
Clinton Administration to prevent the complete disintegration of foreign 
supply control.  This is an unconscionable abdication.  We face the real 
prospect of foreign nations permitting the unchallenged production and 
shipment of illegal drugs to the U.S."[18]

<p>

Former Drug Enforcement Administration director Robert Bonner stated, "I 
believe	that there has been a near total absence of presidential leadership 
by President Clinton in the fight to turn back illegal drug use in this 
country...It [the Administration] clearly fails to promote an increased 
awareness of the dangers of drug abuse, arguably encourages it...The 
Clinton	Administration's national drug strategy has failed miserably, and 
indeed it is a tragedy. The President must reverse this trend and start 
leading our nation's anti-drug efforts."[19]

<p>

Rep. Charles Rangel (D-NY) said, "I've been in Congress for over two 
decades, and I have never, never, never seen a president who cares 
less about this issue."[20]

<p>

Rep. John Conyers (D-MI) told Lee Brown during the drug czar's 
confirmation hearings, "Either the president is with you, or he has just 
given you a chair at the cabinet level...If it is the latter, you are 
getting ready to be the biggest fall guy in the Clinton Administration...We 
might as well close [the drug office] down and stop the pretense."[21]

<p>

Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) spokesman Wayne Roques, a 25-year 
veteran of the drug war, states: "The drug culture, sensing a weakening 
in our national resolve, has reared its ugly head and embarked on a 
well-financed, unconscionable campaign to legalize drugs."[22]

<p>

Attorney General Janet Reno has heard enough of the criticism of the 
Clinton anti-drug efforts.  She stated, "I would just suggest that it 
has come time to stop the political labeling of this fight and all of us 
join together in one common-sense, concentrated	effort that goes after 
the traffickers, that goes after the violence spawned by the drugs but 
provides education, prevention and treatment in a way that can truly make 
a difference."[23]

<p>

The nation's chief law enforcement officer makes a good point, but the 
Clinton Administration's actions send a very different message.  They 
represent a major philosophical shift from the Reagan/Bush years.

<p>

Presidential candidate Bill Clinton told the Democratic National 
Convention in July 1992, "[President Bush] hasn't fought a real war on 
crime and drugs, I will."[24] He promised to combine tough law 
enforcement with expanded treatment and prevention programs.  He also 
pledged to appoint a strong drug czar.[25]

<p>

Clinton's longstanding commitment to drug treatment is evidenced in his 
1995 National Drug Strategy.  He states: "The National Drug Control 
Strategy...confirms...my priorities for addressing this nation's 
continuing drug problem...This strategy gives those who	have fallen 
prey to drugs the opportunity to change their behavior."  His strategy 
focuses on treatment.[26]

<p>
	
The President told <I>Rolling Stone</I> reporters that drug treatment 
is "a big issue."[27] He explained his intent to "change the focus of 
interdiction to work on the roots of the exports to the United States" 
and "we decided to go ahead and put drug treatment into the 
health-care bill."[28]

<p>

Former drug czar Bennett points out that a successful war on drugs must	
balance treatment with prevention and interdiction.  The Clinton strategy 
is unbalanced.

<p>

<center><h3>Some Curious Appointees</h3></center>

<p>

Clinton appointees have orchestrated a campaign to liberalize the 
government's war on drugs.

<p>

For example, Clinton's first Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders created a 
firestorm when she responded to a question at a National Press Club 
luncheon by stating, "I do feel	that we would markedly reduce our crime 
rate if drugs were legalized."[29]

<p>

Her comments evoked reactions from many sectors. Senator Bob Dole 
(R-KS) said, "Americans must be wondering if the Surgeon General 
is hazardous to our health."[30] But Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke 
applauded Elders: "I think what the Surgeon General said was 
absolutely courageous and correct; there should be a study."[31]

<p>

While President Clinton sought to distance himself from Elders' 
comments, the Clinton Justice Department issued a study recommending 
reduction in mandatory minimum drug sentences.[32]

<p>

The DOJ's report, "An Analysis of Non-Violent Drug Offenders with 
Minimal	Criminal Histories,"[33] found that low-level drug law 
violators are much less likely to commit another crime than high-level 
defendants and that sentence length had no effect on recidivism	rates. 
The study recommends that the money spent on jailing low-level drug 
offenders could be better spent on other criminal justice needs such as 
more police.  

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
The Clinton Justice Department<br>
issued a study recommending<br>
reduction in mandatory minimum<br>
sentences.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

But the study has a number of problems. A "significant number" (43 
percent) of the 16,316 federal inmates in this study were non-citizens 
with unknown criminal histories.  This fact should have eliminated these 
inmates from the study.[34] In addition, the study failed to consider 
the impact that incarcerating low-level	drug sellers has on the illicit 
drug market.  Incarcerating convicted drug dealers sends a clear message 
-- drug trafficking has a price.  No one knows how many potential 
traffickers consider the price and turn to alternative employment.

<p>

Not only did the Clinton Administration call for drug legalization, 
but it also issued a 1993 report advocating needle-exchange programs 
even though these programs fail.  Before joining the Clinton 
Administration, Dr. Philip Lee was the principal investigator for a 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study released in September 
1993 which analyzed 37 needle-exchange programs.[35] The report, "The 
Public Health Impact of Needle Exchange Programs in the United States 
and Abroad," concluded[36] that "needle exchanges neither increase 
nor decrease levels of inject[able] drug use,"[37] and stated that 
"studies of the effect of needle exchange programs on HIV infection 
rates do not...and probably cannot provide clear evidence that 
needle exchange programs decrease HIV infection rates."[38]

<p>

Despite these findings, the report recommends:

<p><ul>

<li>"[T]he U.S. government should repeal the ban on federal funding 
of needle exchanges."

<p>

<li>States should repeal their prescription and/or paraphernalia laws 
banning possession of needles.

<p>

<li>Local communities should encourage the wider availability of 
sterile needles by allowing pharmacists to sell or exchange them.

</ul><p>

The Clinton Administration has encouraged needle-exchange programs, 
alleging that they will slow the advance of the virus that causes AIDS. 
Such programs, however, are not effective.

<p>

The much-publicized "Needle Park" (Platzspitz) experiment in Zurich, 
Switzerland was canceled after Swiss authorities concluded that	
needle exchanges promote crime, AIDS, drug abuse, and prostitution. 
After authorities closed the park, drug dealers and addicts moved the 
drug market to a formerly scenic bridge (named Lettensteg). The 
bridge was soon littered with thousands of discarded and probably 
contaminated needles and syringes. In February 1995, Swiss police 
fought a series of fierce gun battles to terminate Lettensteg's drug 
culture operation.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<font size=+1><b><i>
Incarcerating convicted drug<br>

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

A government-sponsored needle exchange program in New York City has 
met a similar fate. "Ever since the lower east side Harm Reduction 
Center, a needle exchange program, began operating in a storefront 
in a residential population of working poor, our community has 
witnessed drug abuse not seen since Operation Pressure Point cleared 
the area of drugs in the 1980s," one resident observed. "You can 
receive your government-sponsored clean needles (there is no limit 
to the number), rob and steal to get money for drugs (or sell your 
clean needles), buy cocaine in storefronts or heroin on any corner, 
then leave behind a pool of blood, dirty syringes, glassine bags, 
alcohol swabs and bottle caps....Statistics on the spread of AIDS 
cannot be the only criteria for measuring the success of the 
program."[39]

<p>

<center><h3>Interdiction Failures</h3></center>

<p>

The Clinton Administration has also failed to sustain an effective 
international drug suppression effort.

<p>

Brian Sheridan, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Drug 
Enforcement Policy and Support, told a House Committee in October 
1994 that the Pentagon recommended $135 million in counterdrug 
budget cuts.[40] The Pentagon has also cut at least 1,000 military 
personnel from drug interdiction programs and has terminated 24 
programs because of "insufficient utility."[41] Sheridan explained, 
"We must recognize that illicit drug use is a deep-seated social 
problem which, like the problems of crime and inner-city poverty, 
will have to be addressed by all Americans over the long-term."[42]
	
<p>

An equal threat is posed by drug lords in South America. The 
Colombia-based Cali cartel is a cocaine distribution network which 
includes a corporate headquarters and franchises throughout the United 
States.  It has effectively overwhelmed the Customs Service, Coast 
Guard and the DEA. It employs sophisticated production,	transportation 
and marketing efforts.  Some laboratories are the size of industrial 
factories, operating with the unofficial endorsement of host 
governments. There are ten entry point/distribution hubs in the U.S. 
The Cali kingpins or their operations chiefs oversee regional directors, 
who in turn supervise regional "cells."  And the cocaine comes to 
American shores	through contract carriers via air, land and sea.  They 
employ cargo jets, large tractor trailers which are seldom inspected 
at the Mexican border, and ships filled to the brim with tons of 
cocaine.  For example, a 14-ton shipment of cocaine was found hidden 
inside concrete fence posts and bound for Longview, Texas via Miami.[43]

<p>

DEA director Thomas Constantine told the House Judiciary Subcommittee 
on Crime, "[O]ur crime situation is controlled by foreign criminals. 
Marketing decisions made in Cali, Colombia or the highlands of the 
Golden Triangle have a direct impact on the drug trade in the 
streets of New York or the waterfront of Miami.  Highly organized, 
technologically-advanced criminal groups have come to dominate the 
production and distribution of heroin and cocaine destined for the 
U.S."[44]

<p>

Although Clinton's DEA chief, Thomas Constantine, pledged at his 
confirmation hearing to promote "the most effective [anti-drug] 
enforcement possible under the rule of law,"  Senator Orrin Hatch 
(R-UT) cautioned, "Some people are concerned there's a different 
attitude down there [at the White House] to legalize drugs."[45]
	
<p>

During Constantine's watch, the DEA has experienced serious personnel 
and budget cuts. He shut down operations for three weeks in early 
1995 to reorganize.  Constantine has also canceled Operation Snow-Cap, 
which had slowed the production and shipment of cocaine in the source 
countries. He has discontinued the TKO kingpin operation, which 
tracked drug lords and brought them to justice.  And now he has 
directed DEA agents to turn away from overseas and focus on the 
grass-roots level, helping police departments with street-level 
suppression.  The mobile enforcement team (MET)	program places teams 
of DEA agents in communities to assist police departments.[46]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
The Clinton Administration<br>
issued a report advocating<br>
needle-exchange programs even<br>
though these programs fail.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

These radical changes jeopardize the U.S.'s international interdiction 
effort and severely threaten the morale of an organization that has 
long defended our borders.  FBI director Louis Freeh told a House 
Committee on March 30, 1995, "If law enforcement is to stem or even 
slow the flood of drugs into this country, we must have a strong and 
effective presence overseas."[47]

<p>

To add insult to injury, DEA agents are subjected to Justice 
Department briefings that show how to properly use syringes to 
inject illicit drugs.  This training is part of the Clinton 
Administration's mandatory AIDS awareness training for federal 
employees.

<p>

Mr. Clinton promised to hire a strong drug czar. In April 1993, 
Clinton elevated the drug czar to the cabinet level, explaining, "I 
believe drug abuse is as serious a problem as we have in America."[48] 
Then he slashed the czar's staff 80 percent.

<p>

Clinton spokeswoman Alice Rivlin, deputy director of OMB, told a 
Congressional budget hearing, "It is not that drug policy is less 
important...On the contrary it is more important...The problem has 
been a lack of leadership, not the size of the staff."[49]

<p>

Selecting Brown does not match the President's promise to hire "a 
strong drug czar" or seek the right "leader."  Brown, a former New 
York police commissioner, left that post under the shadow of the 
Crown Heights riot.

<p>

After becoming drug czar, Brown was excluded from the White House 
communication loop.  In July 1993, White House budget officials 
accepted a major cut in anti-drug programs without consulting Brown. 
He didn't know about the arrangement until he read it in <i>The 
Washington Post</i>.[50]

<p>

<center><h3>Bad Company</h3></center>

<p>

President Clinton has surrounded himself with many counselors, but 
their wisdom with regard to drug issues deserves scrutiny.

<p>

Consider some Clinton advisors and their views on drugs:

<p><ul>

<li><b><i>Clinton's Minister.</i></b> On Sunday, April 10, 1994	the 
Clintons were at church like millions of other Americans.  That morning 
their regular pastor, the Reverend Walter Shropshire of the Foundry 
United Methodist Church, said he believed the government could create 
"a safer environment for all of us" if now-illegal drugs were legalized. 
He later explained, "I happen to have the belief that one of the things 
that we need to re-examine in our current society is the...legalization 
of some drugs.  And my belief is that if the economic portions could be 
cut out of the cocaine and heroin traffic, it might be possible to make 
a safer	environment for all of us."[51]

<p>

<li><b><i>Clinton's College Mentor.</i></b> Not only are some of Mr. 
Clinton's spiritual advisors sympathetic to legalization but so are 
some of his former academic mentors.  His former Yale law professor, 
Steven Duke, co-author of a 1993 book <i>America's Longest War: 
Rethinking Our Tragic Crusade Against Drugs</i>, advocates legalizing 
cocaine, including crack, marijuana and heroin.[52]

<p>

<li><b><i>Clinton's Campaign Advisor.</i></b> Mathea Falco was 
recruited by the Clinton/Gore campaign to advise on drug policy 
issues. She is the president of Drug Strategy, a non-profit 
organization funded by pro-legalization billionaire George Soros, who 
gave Falco's organization a reported $2 million in 1994.[53] Drug 
Strategy is a drug policy think-tank that supports the legalization 
of marijuana.

<p>

During the mid-1970's, Falco was a special assistant to the president 
of the Drug Abuse Council, Inc. and testified in Congress on narcotics 
abuse favoring a "broad" reassessment of drug policy and the review 
of the feasibility of decriminalizing marijuana	and "possibly" cocaine. 
She subsequently served as an Assistant Secretary of State for 
international narcotics under President Carter.[54]

<p>

According to the pro-drug periodical <i>High Times</i>, Falco worked 
closely with Peter Bourne, President Carter's drug policy chief who 
fell from power after he was found to have snorted cocaine at a 
National Organization for the Reform of	Marijuana Laws (NORML) 
party.[55] The magazine told its March 1993 audience that Falco believes 
drug interdiction does not work and that she would support medical use 
of marijuana and needle	exchange.  She was thought to be a candidate 
for the drug czar's job.[56]

</ul>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<ul>

<li><b><i>Clinton's Advisors Reviewing DEA's Performance.</i></b> 
The Clinton Administration hired Mark Kleiman and Peter	Reuter to 
review the performance of the DEA.[57]

<p>

Kleiman is an associate professor at Harvard University's Kennedy 
School of Government and author of <i>Against Excess</i>, which includes 
an endorsement of marijuana legalization.[58] He was once a drug 
policy analyst for the Department of Justice and says that the 
primary goal of drug policy should be to limit the harms drug users 
do to themselves and the resulting harms to others.

<p>

According to <i>High Times</i>, Kleiman advocates user licenses 
for alcohol and pot and served as a graduate advisor for psychedelic 
researcher Rick	Doblin.[59] He spoke at a 1990 conference entitled 
"Regulation or Prohibition: Psychedelics in the	1990s."  In April 
1993, Kleiman spoke at a conference sponsored by NORML stating, "The 
hardest, intellectually, the hardest problem, I think, facing American 
Drug Policy is how to make the psychedelics available for their 
beneficial uses to people who can get benefit from them without	
increasing use under dangerous conditions, and abuse."[60]

<p>

In October 1994, John Carnevale, director of Office of Planning and 
Budget, Executive Office of the President, Office of National Drug 
Control Policy, defended the drug czar's decision to employ Kleiman's 
services. His organization, BOTEC, Inc., Carnevale said "has conducted 
a number of important studies over the past few years for ONDCP, 
especially in the area of monitoring the emerging heroin situation...At	
the current time, BOTEC's work, for whose timeliness and quality we have 
very high regard, continues to be the analysis of heroin use trends."[61] 
Kleiman is listed by Lee Brown as one of the many "expert individuals" 
to the drug czar for the 1995 National Drug Control Strategy.[62]

<p>

<li><b><i>Clinton's White House Staff.</i></b> All White House staff 
members require security clearances. Use of illegal drugs has long 
been a disqualification for a security clearance.

<p>

One of the first indications that drugs would be viewed differently 
by the Clinton Administration was the conduct of drug-testing for 
incoming presidential staff members.  The Clinton White House waived 
drug-testing until February 15, 1993 -- almost four weeks into the 
new administration.[63] By comparison, the Bush Administration 
required all new presidential aides to obtain negative test results 
before they could start work at the White House.[64]

<p>

The problem with staff drug testing continued for more than a year. 
In July 1994, then-press secretary Dee Dee Myers confirmed that one 
third of the White House staff still did not have "permanent 
passes."[65] This indicated a possible problem with drug-testing 
compliance. She admitted to being one of those without a pass, explaining 
she didn't have time to complete the paperwork.[66]

<p>

Director of White House Administration Patsy Thomasson oversees the 
security passes.  She once served at the right hand of an Arkansas 
investor, Dan Lasater, who pleaded guilty to federal drug charges. Her 
past association with a drug felon compelled the Senate to vote 98-0 
in June 1994 to require the president to certify that Thomasson	has 
no history of drug abuse.[67]

The suspicions about the White House staff linger. For example, the 
<i>Washington Times</i> reported in January 1995 that White House 
staffers have been seen	using drugs at parties around Washington. 
The paper quoted an unnamed source, "There's this private little 
social scene and everybody just assumes that no one's going to 
tattletale." Allegedly, one of the drug-using staff members works on 
the White House's National Security Council.[68]

<p>

Newt Gingrich ignited a firestorm on December 4, 1994 when he said, "I 
had a senior law enforcement official tell me that, in his judgment, 
up to a quarter of the White House Staff, when they first came in, 
had used drugs in the last four or five years...it's very clear that 
they had huge problems getting people through security clearances 
because they kept bringing people in who had a lot of things that 
weren't very easy to clear."[69]

<p>

White House Chief of Staff Leon	Panetta rebutted the allegation. "There 
is no one in the White House who uses drugs."  But according to 
the <i>Washington Times</i>, White House staffers who frequent the 
Oval Office were seen "passing around joints [marijuana cigarettes]" 
at a local party.[70]

<p>

An unnamed senior administration official said that Gingrich got 
the number right but the time period wrong.  He said that a quarter 
of the White House staff admitted to using illegal drugs at some point 
in the past, however, that's well below the national average of almost 
40 percent.  Miss Myers noted, "Only one employee has failed a random 
drug test and that employee was a career person in a non-policy	
role."[71]

<p>

As recently as March 27, 1995, Miss Thomasson told a Senate subcommittee 
that 11	White House staffers are in a special random drug-testing 
program because of concerns about "recent drug use."  She also 
acknowledged that volunteers without adequate security clearances have 
been given access to sensitive areas in the White House and added that 
92.2 percent of eligible staff members had received permanent entrance 
passes.[72]

<center><h3>Other Pro-Legalization Allies</h3></center>

<p>

The Clinton Administration's retreat in the drug war has encouraged 
a wide range of pro-legalization advocates, including:

<p><ul>

<li><b><i>Ethan Nadelmann.</i></b> He heads a pro-drug organization, 
the Lindesmith Center, which is heavily funded by billionaire George 
Soros.[73] Soros is pushing the "harm reduction" agenda, which is 
widely viewed as a first step toward legalization.  Soros's goal "is 
to invigorate and support a broader debate on drug policy" and to shift 
from drug war to "drug peace."[74]

<p>

Nadelmann advances the notion that illegal drug use is a private issue 
and predicts that "in another five or ten years maybe the right over 
one's consciousness, the right to possess and consume drugs, may be 
as powerfully and as widely understood as the other rights of Americans	
are."[75]

<p>

Nadelmann told <i>Reason</i> magazine, "The replacement of the 
Bush Administration with the Clinton Administration was generally a 
good thing.  It brought in a lot of new blood, new thinking. Lee 
Brown is not what I would call a desirable drug czar, but he's no 
William Bennett, either. There's more room for consideration of 
alternatives."[76]

<p>

<li><b><i>Rep. Barney Frank (D-MA).</i></b> Congressman Frank told 
a 1994 NORML conference, "I think we ought to make smoking marijuana 
legal."[77] He also told a Harvard Law School conference titled, 
"Crime, Drugs, Health and Prohibition," that the government spends 
too much money to stop drug trafficking.[78] He told a radio 
audience, "We should give the money to drug treatment and local 
cops."[79]

<p>

<li><b><i>Eric Sterling.</i></b> He serves as president of the 
nonprofit Criminal Justice Policy Foundation and is a former counsel 
to the U.S. House Subcommittee on Crime and principal aide in 
developing parts of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984 and 
the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986.

<p>

He currently works with the Centers for Disease Control and the 
D.C. Commission on Public Health and has been honored by the U.S. 
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the U.S. Postal 
Inspection Service. Sterling told a 1991 NORML conference, "Hi,	
I'm Eric Sterling and I'm a 15-year member of NORML and I'm really 
glad to be here to talk to so many of you...How many of you are 
stoned now?  Show of hands.  Honestly, how many of you are stoned 
now...about a quarter.  And I ask that question because I used to 
get stoned at NORML conferences	and it was my favorite, favorite 
times [sic] to get stoned."[80]

</ul>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<ul>

Mr. Sterling was a guest speaker at the 6th Annual Conference on 
Drug-Free Schools and Communities.  Some attendees called for his 
removal based on his open advocacy of drug use.

<p>

He continues to speak out for drug legalization. For example, he 
was a guest speaker at the 1993 Fifth Annual Hemp Freedom Rally in 
Massachusetts and spoke at a pro-pot rally in front of the White House 
on January 21, 1993.  He led the crowd in chanting "Inhale to the 
Chief."

<p>

<li><b><i>Organizations like the Drug Policy Foundation.</i></b> 
Michigan drug czar Robert Peterson observed, "Groups like [the] 
Drug Policy Foundation are run by three-piece-suited guys, not dope 
smokers, and they say they don't support legalization, that they're 
just studying alternatives...But I think that's just to put a 
respectable front on what they are really doing, lobbying for 
legalization...I got hold of the agenda for one of their meetings, 
and it included discussions of money laundering and bank secrecy."[81]

<p>

The DPF	will award more than $1 million in grants to promote drug 
legalization programs. For example, in February 1995, DPF awarded 
$25,000 to Cannabis Action Network, which advocates marijuana use; 
$15,000 to NORML for National Medical Marijuana Day; and $3,000 to 
the National AIDS Brigade which	promotes needle exchange programs.[82]

</ul><p>

<center><h3>Conclusion</h3></center>

<p>

The Clinton Administration's actions and its advisors' reputations 
suggest a general lack of commitment to the drug war.  With drug abuse 
on the rise, the President must lead the nation in an all-out effort 
to turn the tide of drugs away from our shores and especially away from 
our children.

<h3>COMPULSORY UNION DUES PAY FOR POLITICS </h3>
<a href="/heritage/staff/wittmann.htm">Marshall Wittmann</a> and Charles P. Griffin<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
February 1, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; While Democrat Ron Wyden's victory in the Oregon special election is sure to spark speculation about which party will win big this November, it also shows how the money of average Americans can be used against their wishes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; After all, the AFL-CIO and other labor unions provided tremendous support for Wyden's candidacy. And all too often labor union officials rely on compulsory dues to finance political activism. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The pro-Wyden effort provides a glimpse at organized labor's plans for the 1996 elections. The AFL-CIO recently announced a plan to spend more than $35 million this year -- seven times the usual amount -- on electioneering. Unfortunately, many of these activities will be financed involuntarily by rank-and-file union members who may disagree with the agendas of union officials. Republican and Democratic unionists alike are compelled to pay dues to the labor officials; these dues are then used to pay for many political activities.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Congress may soon debate campaign finance reform legislation. Ending this unjust abuse of hard-working men and women should be a part of any true reform.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; In the past few months, a sleeping giant awoke when the AFL-CIO elected a new  leadership dedicated to advancing a far-left political agenda.  When John Sweeney took over the union's leadership late last year he pledged greater political involvement by the organization.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;After his installation as AFL-CIO president, Sweeney swiftly moved to put a new face in charge of election activities by naming former Clinton administration Labor Department official Steve Rosenthal as the union's political director. Secretary of Labor Robert Reich declared, "Steve Rosenthal will be a valuable asset in the new leadership's mission to revitalize the nation's union movement." Sweeney said Rosenthal's task would be "building a powerful, progressive national movement of working people."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The just-completed special election in Oregon to fill the seat of former Sen. Robert Packwood provided the new leaders a chance to flex their partisan muscles. According to AFL-CIO documents, there were more than 25 union activists (12 from the AFL-CIO alone) devoted full-time to the efforts to elect a Democratic senator. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Political director Rosenthal bragged, "We're mailing endorsement pieces to 75,000 union members and persuasion pieces to an estimated 40,000." The AFL-CIO newsletter noted that "another 100,000 fliers comparing the candidates' records are being produced, and phone banks have been set up across the state."
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; The AFL-CIO did not act alone, however. By joining forces with at least 11 other unions, organized labor was able to mount a considerable presence in this one race. Among the other participants were the American Federation of Teachers, the American Federation of Government Employees, the National Association of Letter Carriers, and the Teamsters. The considerable firepower these organizations mustered resulted in more than $183,000 in political action committee (PAC) donations to the democratic candidate. Not a single dollar of union donations went to the GOP nominee. Are all union members Democrats? We doubt it.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Of course, these direct donations were only a small part of the picture. No doubt many of the organizers, mailings and phone banks were financed directly by the unions at substantially more than the cost of the PAC donations.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Union tactics came under scrutiny by the media and the voters. The Teamsters were heavily criticized for ads they ran blaming the death of a teenage worker on the Republican candidate's business. Even the beneficiary of the Teamsters efforts, Ron Wyden, was forced to issue a public statement disavowing the ad and encouraging the union to pull it off the air. Fair-minded union members of either party could strongly object to such tactics. Yet, their dues more than likely paid for them. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Union politicking is nothing new. There is no question that labor unions have a right to participate in the electoral process. But as the clamor for campaign finance reform continues, it behooves members of Congress to consider whether it is just to force union members to pay for political activities whether they agree with those activities or not. Corporations may not provide this sort of direct candidate support and neither should their organized labor counterparts.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Meaningful reform must level the playing field and ensure that only voluntary contributions are used for politics.  Aggressive political activities by labor unions must not be funded by coercion. Congress should end these corrupt practices.

<title>STATUTORY RAPE: THE DIRTY SECRET BEHIND TEEN SEX NUMBERS</title>

<body>

<center>

<img src="/townhall/FRC/fampol/fampolrd.gif">

<h1>Statutory Rape:</h1>
<h2><i>The Dirty Secret Behind Teen Sex Numbers</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>C</font>ontrary to the common perception that teenage sex 
and pregnancy typically stem from two teenagers getting caught up in the 
heat of the moment, new research reveals that many teenage girls are
being sexually exploited and impregnated by adult men.

<p>

In fact, a recent study published in the <I>American Journal of
Public Health</I> found that adult men fathered two-thirds of
the infants born to school-aged mothers in California in 1993.
On average, these men were 4.2 years older than the senior-high
mothers and 6.7 years older than the junior-high mothers.[1]

<p>

Likewise, a review of California's 1990 vital statistics found
that men older than high school age sired 77 percent of all births
to high school-aged girls (ages 16-18) and 51 percent of births
to junior high school-aged girls (15 and younger). Men over age
25 fathered twice as many teenage births as did boys under age
18, and men over age 20 fathered five times more births to junior
high school-aged girls than did junior high school-aged boys.[2]

<p>

Unfortunately, this phenomenon is not limited to the state of
California. A recent study by the Population Reference Bureau
found that about two-thirds of births to teenage girls nationwide
are fathered by adult men age 20 or older.[3] Additionally, the Alan
Guttmacher Institute's 1994 report, &quot;Sex and America's Teenagers,&quot;
found that six of 10 girls who had sex before age 15 were coerced
by males an average of six years their senior.[4] The Urban Institute
cites a study showing that &quot;three quarters of females who
had sexual intercourse before age 14 reported having had sex 
involuntarily.&quot;[5]

That our culture at large has been slow to recognize this phenomenon
is not surprising. At one time, the picture of teenage pregnancy
did look vastly different than it does today. In 1970, seven of
10 teen births were within marriage. Today, the opposite is true
-- seven of 10 teen births are out-of-wedlock[6] . . . and many are
the results of statutory rape and victimization.

<p>

In many respects, the rise in statutory rape is the tragic and
predictable consequence of the larger moral free-for-all that
began during the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 1970s. As
sex was severed from the context of marriage and perceived barriers
to personal &quot;freedom&quot; were torn down, the door was opened
to a &quot;liberation&quot; in which predators were given easier
access to the most vulnerable in our society.

<center><h3>Family Breakdown: Fatherlessness and Child Abuse</h3></center>

<p>

At the heart of this problem, as with most social pathologies,
is the breakdown of the intact two-parent family unit.

<p>

Over the last 25 years, the change in family patterns has been
dramatic. It used to be that the man in every girl's life was
her father. He was her protector and provider, shielding her honor
and ensuring her safety. But between 1970 and 1995, the share
of married-couple families with dependent children dropped by
one-third, while the proportion of single-parent families nearly
doubled. In 1995, 18.9 million children lived with only one parent,
compared with 8.2 million in 1970. Today, the large number of
single-parent families are increasingly due to illegitimacy rather
than divorce.[7]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Fatherlessness is associated<br>
with increased risk of child<br>
sexual abuse.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Consequently, fewer fathers are around to protect and defend their
daughters' safety. And with more girls lacking the love and attention
that only a father can give, more of them are vulnerable to abuse,
and that abuse leaves them willing to settle for perverse alternatives,
namely, seeking intimacy with predatory adult men.

<p>

The research is clear: fatherlessness is associated with increased
risk of child sexual abuse.

<p>

For example, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services'
<I>National Health Interview Survey</I> (1988) found that children
from disrupted families are at a much higher risk for physical
or sexual abuse than children from intact, two-parent families.[8]

<p>

A 1993 study in the <I>British Journal of Psychiatry</I> found
that childhood sexual abuse occurred more frequently in women
from disadvantaged and difficult family backgrounds, and that
their risks of becoming a victim were increased if they came from
a broken home.[9]

<p>

Furthermore, children whose parents separate are significantly
more likely to engage in early sexual activity than their peers
from intact, two-parent families, according to a 1994 study in
<I>Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent 
Psychiatry</I>.[10]

<p>

Dr. George Rekers of the University of South Carolina School of
Medicine found that compared with girls in intact nuclear families,
girls who lost their fathers through divorce were overly responsive
to males, more likely to be sexually involved with males in adolescence,
and more often pregnant before marriage.[11]

<p>

David Murray, a social anthropologist, explains the effects of
illegitimacy on girls this way: &quot;For the girls, at earliest
nubility comes predation by older males, undeterred by a resident
father who would protect her honor and her safety.&quot;[12]

<p>

One might mistakenly presume that the presence of a male figure,
besides the father, would help alleviate the situation. But in
fact, when illegitimacy or divorce results in a subsequent marriage,
remarriage, or cohabiting relationship, the likelihood of child
abuse increases.

<p>

According to a study by the Canadian researchers Martin Daly and
Margo Wilson, preschool children in stepfamilies are 40 times
as likely as children in intact families to suffer physical or
sexual abuse.[13]

<p>

Additionally, a 1994 study in the <i>Journal of Comparative Family
Studies</i> found that, out of 52,000 child abuse cases, 72 percent
involved children living in a household without one or both biological
parents, even though such households comprise roughly a third
of all households with children.[14]

<p>

Not only is fatherlessness associated with child abuse, but abused
children are also more vulnerable to further exploitation, particularly
further sexual exploitation. Kathy Szafran, residential program
director for the Florence Crittenton Homes and Services in West
Virginia, was quoted in <I>The Washington Times</I> as saying,
&quot;It shouldn't be hard to see 'why a child who's been molested
since age 7 is acting out sexually at age 14.'&quot;

<p>

Indeed, research shows that teenage mothers whose babies were
fathered by adult men are disproportionately the childhood victims
of sexual assault by adult men.[15]

<p>

A 1992 Washington state study of 535 adolescent mothers found
that 62 percent of the teenage mothers had had a history of rape
or sexual molestation by men whose ages averaged 27 years.[16] This
study found that, compared with nonabused mothers, abused adolescent
mothers initiated sex earlier, had sex with much older partners,
and engaged in riskier, more frequent, and promiscuous sex.[17]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

In a recent edition of <I>Newsweek</I>, Joe Klein poignantly described
the connection between fatherlessness, child abuse, and subsequent
sexual victimization when he recounted the personal testimony
of a girl whom he called Charlette. &quot;The guy's name was Mickey.
He was older, in his mid-20s. Charlette was going through a bad
time: her stepfather had come home from prison, was beating her
mother, was beating on her. 'I lived in the streets for a while,
starting when I was 14,' she said. 'I was young and vulnerable.
I had problems. He was going to protect me, teach me things, discipline
my mind. But when I told him I was pregnant, he was gone. I began
to ask around.... I found he had six other children, mostly with
younger girls. I was naive, and he took advantage of me.&quot;
Joe Klein later remarked, &quot;As for the girls, who are inevitably
fatherless, Charlette's yearning for protection -- for a <I>father</I>
-- seems entirely comprehensible.&quot;[18]

<p>

Fatherlessness, however, not only creates the environment for
more vulnerable girls, it also helps create more predatory males.
Research shows that boys who grow up without fathers are far more
likely to engage in violent behavior and promiscuity than those
who grow up in two-parent homes.

<p>

According to a 1990 article by Nicholas Davidson in <I>Policy
Review</I>, 60 percent of America's rapists grew up in homes without
fathers.[19] Furthermore, a research review by Dr. George Rekers of
the University of South Carolina School of Medicine found that
the fatherless boys exhibit greater aggressiveness or exaggerated
masculine behavior.[20]

<p>

It is also important to note that many of these predatory adult
men may have originated from fatherless families in which they,
too, had been abused.

<p>

<center><h3>Family Breakdown: The Lack of Parental Supervision</h3></center>

<p>

Ensuring that children receive adequate parental supervision is
already a difficult task in today's two-parent homes because the
financial constraints of modern-day life make it increasingly
difficult for one parent to stay at home full-time. But when parents
face single-parenthood because of divorce or illegitimacy, the
difficulties of supervising their children are compounded.

<p>

Research shows that teenagers who are subject to less adult supervision
are more likely to engage in sexual activity. This association
applies not only to homes which lack parental supervision during
the day, but also to neighborhoods in which a high percentage
of the adult labor force works full-time. This effect suggests
that teenagers who are less closely supervised have more opportunity
to engage in sexual behavior.

<p>

While the amount of parental and/or adult supervision that a teenager
receives during the day is difficult to measure, researchers have
often used maternal employment as a proxy for adult supervision
since much teen sexual activity today takes place after school
in the homes of &quot;latchkey&quot; children.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<font size=+1><b><i>

intercourse is greater<br>

for adolescents with<br>
mothers employed part-<br>
time.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

For example, a 1993 study published in <I>Public Health Reports</I>
found that young males who have mothers that work full-time are
significantly more likely (by 89 percent in blacks and 26 percent
in nonblacks) to have initiated intercourse than are boys with
non-employed mothers. Young black males who have mothers that
work for pay part-time are 56 percent more likely to have started
having intercourse than are those whose mothers are not employed.[21]

<p>

The same study also found that the effect of maternal employment
on early intercourse is greater for teens with mothers employed
full-time than for adolescents with mothers employed part-time.
Compared with non-employed mothers, part-time work is associated
with a 26 percent increase in early intercourse and full-time
work is associated with a 45 percent increase.[22]

<p>

Furthermore, a 1994 study in the <I>Journal of Marriage and the
Family</I> reported that white females whose mothers are employed
outside the home are more likely to have had intercourse than
females whose mothers are not employed.[23]

<p>

This same study also found that the percentage of female labor
force participants who are employed full-time in a given neighborhood
is associated with an increased likelihood of premarital sexual
activity among young women in the neighborhood. This effect, which
is consistent in both black and white female teenagers,[24] suggests
that the deterrent effect of having a parent in the home may be
undermined somewhat if the girl's boyfriend goes home to an empty
house after school.

<p>

Additionally, a 1994 study published in the <I>Journal of Adolescent
Health</I> found that white teenage girls whose mothers work for
pay full-time outside the home are more likely to lead promiscuous
lives as adults (have multiple partners) than girls whose mothers
do not work for pay full-time.[25]

<p>

<center><h3>Erosion of Cultural Protections</h3></center>

<p>

While absent fathers figure prominently in this new phenomenon
of child abuse, they are not solely to blame for the devastation.
Cultural influences such as the media and schools have also failed
to protect children.

<p>

Television and movies regularly expose children to sexually explicit
images, glamorizing sex and violence. While the instances of this
type of cultural pollution are too numerous to count, one particular
example should be noted here. A recent (March 1996) episode of
the television prime time drama,<I> Chicago Hope</I>, featured
a storyline in which a 14-year-old girl was having sex with an
adult man. The drama explored both viewpoints about why it was
either permissible or impermissible for the young girl to be having
sex with an adult man, but in the end, the show condoned their
sexual relations because they were &quot;in love.&quot;

<p>

In addition to the media, schools have now taken up the mantle
of exposing children to sexually explicit information -- this
time, in the guise of &quot;sex education.&quot; Many school administrators
have mistakenly concluded that the way to &quot;prevent&quot;
the problem of teen pregnancy is to expose children at progressively
younger and younger ages to more explicit sex education in the
school, so that children can learn how to protect themselves with
condoms, etc. But this scenario is a textbook case in which the
&quot;cure&quot; is far worse than the disease.

<p>

The results of the National Survey of Adolescent Males published
in the November 1993 issue of <I>Public Health Reports</I> show
that young males who were taught about birth control were more
likely to experiment with sex at an earlier age than if they had
received no (formal) instruction.[26]

<p>

Furthermore, explicit sex education can tear down the natural
inhibitions and defenses of both young boys and girls, leaving
them vulnerable to sexual predators. Indeed, pedophiles often
use pornography to lure their young victims.[27]

<p>

In spite of this, the Sex Information and Education Council of
the United States (SIECUS), a federally-funded, nationally-recognized
organization, has issued national sex education guidelines which
promote teaching kindergartners about masturbation and junior
and senior high school students about the &quot;benefits&quot;
of pornography, among other topics.[28]

<p>

<center><h3>Erosion of Legal Protections</h3></center>

<p>

Declining cultural norms and values also have a detrimental effect
on laws intended to protect children. When the culture condones
particular kinds of illegal behavior, the law loses its authority
to prosecute. This has clearly been the case with statutory rape
laws.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Laws against statutory rape were originally designed to protect
adolescent girls -- typically aged 16 and under -- from sex under
any circumstance, regardless of whether there was &quot;consent.&quot;
These laws were premised on the belief that young girls were too
immature to be having sex and that they could no more give meaningful
consent to sexual activity than they &quot;could consent to work
nights as a stripper in a bar.&quot;[29] But during the sexual revolution
of the 1960s and 1970s, states began to change their laws to reflect
more permissive cultural attitudes.

<p>

First, the age of consent for sexual activity was lowered or altered.
In two states, Hawaii and Pennsylvania, 14 years is the age of
consent. Many other laws were changed to say that having sex with
a young teenage girl was statutory rape, but sex with a girl in
her mid-teens was only considered statutory rape if the male was
three or four years older than she was. In other words, a 15-year-old
girl could have sex with a 15-year-old boy, but not with a 19-year-old
man.[30]

<p>

For example, in Virginia, 18 is the age of consent. However, a
person can only be prosecuted for rape if the victim is under
13 years old. A lesser felony offense can be charged if a person
three or more years older has consensual intercourse with a 13-
or 14-year old, but it is only a misdemeanor if the offender is
less than three years older. It is also considered only a misdemeanor
if a person over 18 has consensual intercourse with a child aged
15 or older.[31]

<p>

In Indiana, where the age of consent is 16, there is no longer
a crime of statutory rape. Instead, the state can charge an adult
with child molestation if the child is under age 14, or with sexual
misconduct if the minor is 14 or 15 years old. However, the sexual
misconduct charge can only be leveled at people 18 years and older.
Thus, a 17-year-old who has sex with a 14-year-old could not be
charged with sexual misconduct.[32]

<p>

Although it may seem absurd that the United States allowed the
age of sexual consent to be lowered at all, the example of Britain's
current exploration on lowering their own age of sexual consent
laws is revealing. Indeed, the arguments being currently used
by British proponents of lowering the age of consent mirror the
arguments that led the United States down this slippery slope.
Consider the comments of Alison Hadley of The Brook Advisory Centres,
which runs 27 National Health Service-funded birth control clinics
for teenagers and young adults in England, Scotland, and Ulster:
&quot;Teenagers under 16 don't automatically put a brake on their
raging hormones and postpone having sex just because it is decreed
in law. The age of consent also presupposes that we all mature
at the same time. We don't. We often see mature girls of 14 as
well as 16-year-olds with plenty of growing still to do. Like
it or not, many 14- and 15-year-olds are having sex.&quot;[33]

<p>

Unfortunately, the United States knows all too well about the
devastating consequences of that perverse logic.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Second, lax law enforcement of statutory rape crimes have added
fuel to the fire. Few courts have given priority to the prosecution
of adults who have sex with minors, especially because they are
pressed with many other cases of violent delinquency and child
abuse. But prosecutors say that the biggest stumbling block against
bringing a case to court is the girls themselves. Many girls are
reluctant, if not hostile witnesses who either recant or refuse
to testify against their adult &quot;lovers,&quot; the fathers
of their children.[34] The girls may also decline to name the father
if they fear retaliation.[35]

<p>

In addition, parents have not usually understood that they can
seek legal protection through the courts. Parents may ask a juvenile
court judge to declare the girl &quot;ungovernable&quot; and order
her not to see the man. But such cases are low in priorities for
courts, and a court order may not stop stubborn lovers anyway.
If juvenile court sanctions fail, parents can take the next step
and press criminal charges. But police and prosecutors say they're
often hamstrung in these cases, by parents afraid that if the
law gets involved, their daughters will run away, and by lack
of evidence when lovestruck girls refuse to testify.[36]

<p>

Third, the law has not always upheld the rights of parents to
protect their children's innocence. For example, the federal family
planning program -- Title X of the Public Health Service Act --
undermines parental authority in their children's reproductive
health decision-making. Title X is a categorical grant program
which gives federal funds to family planning clinics all around
the country. Title X clinics offer contraceptives, pelvic exams,
pregnancy tests, screening for sexually-transmitted diseases,
and sexual health counseling to minors without parental notification
or consent.[37] However, even though the actual law specifies that
family participation is to be encouraged, the federal policy guidelines
state that clinics receiving Title X support must guarantee patient
confidentiality, and this mandate that has been upheld by the
courts.[38]

<p>

Furthermore, Title X clinics have no provisions regarding the
reporting of suspected cases of statutory rape. In fact, these
clinics may be indirectly aiding and abetting the problem in at
least four ways: (1) the clinic does not involve parents, even
in cases where the child is very young and is admittedly &quot;sexually
active,&quot; (2) the clinic's dispensation of contraceptives
can mask a problem that might otherwise be brought to light, (3)
clinics will see and treat &quot;any woman, regardless of age,&quot;
even when that &quot;woman&quot; is 11 or 12 years old,[39] and (4)
counselors are not trained to look for cases of statutory rape
nor are they required to report any suspected cases of statutory
rape to local law enforcement. That omission is especially horrendous
in light of the current data which show that two-thirds of all
teenage births are fathered by adult men.

<p>

<center><h3>Renew Efforts to Prosecute Statutory Rape</h3></center>

<p>

The most direct way to address the problem of statutory rape is
through the law enforcement system. California Governor Pete Wilson
has cracked down on statutory rapists as part of his state's campaign
against teenage pregnancy. Last summer he allocated $2.4 million
to a pilot program for 16 counties to begin prosecuting men who
engage in sex with underage girls, and in January 1996, he pledged
$6 million more for a statewide crackdown.[40]

<p>

The California State Assembly also recently passed a bill which
would add penalties of up to five years in jail for statutory
rape when a minor becomes pregnant. This penalty can be sought
in addition to civil and/or criminal suits for statutory rape.[41]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Few courts have given<br>
priority to the prosecution<br>
of adults who have sex<br>
with minors.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

In Florida, state legislators will soon consider a &quot;Teen
Predators Act&quot; which would create a new child abuse felony
in cases where a man older than 21 impregnates a girl under 16.
A conviction would result in mandatory prison time.[42] Another bill
seeking consideration in Florida is nicknamed MAMA, which stands
for &quot;Make Adult Males Accountable.&quot; This bill would
allow some statutory rapists to be prosecuted under child-abuse
laws, which would have the beneficial effect of requiring medical
facilities, day-care centers, and schools to report statutory
rape as they would any other incident of suspected child abuse.[43]

<p>

Efforts must also be made to change the rhetoric and perception
under which minors are viewed as mature decision-makers. For example,
in the Alan Guttmacher Institute's 1994 report, &quot;Sex and
America's Teenagers,&quot; adolescents girls who have been exploited
by adult men are repeatedly referred to as &quot;sexually-experienced
women.&quot;[44] The Alan Guttmacher Institute, Planned Parenthood,
and other proponents of aggressive marketing of contraceptives
and abortions to minor children have consistently refused to use
language that reinforces the need for special protection for teenage
girls and boys -- especially that provided by their families.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Title X clinics have<br>
no provisions regarding<br>
the reporting of suspected<br>
cases of statutory rape.<br>

may be indirectly aiding<br>
and abetting the problem.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The use of &quot;women&quot; in this context serves the purpose
of fostering an egalitarian drive to repeal parental rights statutes,
but masks the emotional and psychological immaturity that makes
sexual activity at this stage of life especially risky.[45]

<p>

Finally, states should seriously consider raising the age of sexual
consent laws to mirror the age of marriage laws. Currently, 16
is the age of sexual consent in most states, but the minimum legal
age of marriage in most states is 18.[46] (A few states have higher
ages for marriage, but no state's marriage law is below the age
of 18, except with parental consent.) This action would not only
allow states to legally prosecute the statutory rape cases which
occur during the later teen years (ages 16-17), but it would also
help to relink sex to its proper context within marriage.

<p>

<center><h3>Strengthen the Family</h3></center>

<p>

While public policy can directly address the problem of statutory
rape through legislative means, its ability to impact the root
cause of statutory rape -- family breakdown -- is only indirect
at best. After all, the law cannot -- and should not -- dictate
to families how to raise their children, but the law can and should
encourage behaviors which help strengthen the family through the
use of incentives and disincentives.

<p>

For example, in order to discourage illegitimacy, public policy
makers have sought to implement a &quot;family cap,&quot; a measure
which would halt additional welfare payments to mothers who bear
further illegitimate children while on welfare. Public policy
makers have also sought to overturn no-fault divorce laws and/or
elevate marriage from a &quot;contract&quot; to a &quot;covenant&quot;
relationship in order to support the permanency of marriage. Furthermore,
laws which provide tax relief for families as well as policies
which provide employees with more flexible work hours and/or work-at-home
arrangements may help to increase parental supervision of children.

<p>

While the aforementioned policies are sound and can be very helpful,
they alone cannot break the cycle of illegitimacy and divorce,
especially because the scourges of illegitimacy and divorce are
transferred through generations. That is, children whose parents
are unmarried or divorced are more likely to also one day bear
illegitimate children or have their own marriages end in divorce.[47]
Thus, other non-public policy means of prevention must be encouraged
as well.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
States should seriously<br>
consider raising the age<br>
of sexual consent laws<br>
to mirror the age of<br>
marriage laws.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

One effective method of prevention which should not be overlooked
is the impact of religion. Indeed, a large body of research shows
that religiously committed individuals are less likely to divorce
or separate from one's spouse.[48] Teenagers with high personal religiosity
are also less likely to engage in premarital sex or cohabit.[49] Another
study found that adolescent males who went to church more often
at age 14 were less likely to have early intercourse.[50]

<p>

<center><h3>Conclusion</h3></center>

<p>

The current trend of adult men impregnating teenage girls is a
natural consequence of family breakdown and its subsequent effects
on culture and the law. But what children need now is what they
have always needed -- for adults to protect their innocence. They
need fathers and mothers who will love and supervise them, laws
that punish statutory rapists, and a culture which values and
upholds the sacredness of marital sex, the permanency of marriage,
and the authority of parents.

<title>Remember the Victims of Communism -- Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">


<center>

<h3>Remember the Victims of Communism</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>

January 25, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
	In America we have memorials commemorating those who died in the Civil War, both 
World Wars, the Vietnam and Korean Wars, the holocaust, and the civil rights movement.  But 
we have no memorial to the 100 million casualties of the most brutal genocide ever visited upon 
the human race:  communism.
<p>	Fortunately, this glaring oversight is about to be rectified.  In 1993 -- more than 75 years 
after the Bolsheviks first embarked on their glorious revolution -- Congress approved and 
President Clinton signed legislation authorizing a memorial to the victims of communism.
<p>	It's long overdue.  In all of world history, no political ideology has sent more people to 
the slaughterhouse than Karl Marx's utopian pipe-dream.  Even Hitler, certainly one of history's 
most demented butchers, killed only one-tenth the number of people that Marx's disciples killed. 
Yet, most Americans have no idea just how bloody communism's legacy is. 
<P>	How many Americans, for example, know that between 1917 and 1987 the communist 
dictators in the former Soviet Union murdered 62 million people? How many know that China, 
has killed more than 38 million people?  These two communist regimes alone have stamped out 
100 million human lives -- 25 million more than died in the Black Plague, formerly the world's 
deadliest disaster.
<p>	And this doesn't even include the body count from the smaller communist regimes:  
Cambodia, 2 million dead at the hands of Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge; Vietnam, 850,000 sacrificed 
to the greater glory of Ho Chi Minh; Ethiopia, tens of thousands slaughtered during Mengistu 
Haile Mariam's "Red Terror"; and Cuba, whose death toll, while certainly in the tens of 
thousands, only Fidel Castro knows for sure. 
<p>	As much as some would like to downplay the horrors of communism (frequently because 
they viewed the United States as a threat to mankind equal to the regimes committing these 
horrors), communism's signature has never changed: death.
<p>	Those who forget the past are condemned to repeat it, the philosopher George Santayana 
said.  That's why a memorial to the victims of communism in the nation's capital is necessary 
and proper.  
<p>	Future generations must know that when you impose a ruthless ideology by force -- no 
matter how "well-intentioned" -- the result is human carnage.  So it is with a deep sense of honor 
that I've accepted an invitation to serve on the memorial's advisory board.  
<P>	Fittingly, the memorial also will celebrate those heroes who made possible the West's 
victory over tyranny. As observed by my colleague and long-time Cold Warrior Hugh Newton -- 
to whom credit goes for the idea of an anti-communist Hall of Heroes -- without the likes of 
Ronald Reagan, Margaret Thatcher, Pope John Paul II, Lech Walesa and Alexander 
Solzhenitsyn, among others, we'd still be worried about trading missiles with Russia, rather than 
trading goods.
<p>	As befits a memorial to the victims of government-sponsored violence, the project will be 
funded entirely with private money.  The goal is to raise $100 million -- one dollar for each of 
the 100 million victims of Marx and Mao.  
<p>	In addition to a roll call of every victim of communism that can be identified and the Hall 
of Heroes, the memorial also will feature a Hall of Infamy -- artifacts of communism's 
inhumanity to man, including a section of the Berlin Wall, a re-creation of a barracks from the 
Soviet Gulag, a "room" at the Hanoi Hilton and a cell at Castro's infamous Isle of Pines.
<p>	If you would like to join many of us and contribute to the creation of this memorial, I 
encourage you to do so.  Just write to the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation, P.O. 
Box 1997, Washington, DC 20013-1997.  Marx, Lenin, Stalin and Mao will never be forgotten, 
and neither should their victims.

<title>THE ONE-HOUSE SCHOOLROOM</title>

<body>

<center>

<img src="/townhall/FRC/fampol/fampolbl.gif">

<h1>The One-House Schoolroom</h1>
<h2><i>The Extraordinary Influence of<br>
Family Life on Student Learning</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>S</font>he grew up during the depression in a small mill 
town in the South.  Her father was a textile worker.  Her mother, a 
homemaker. She not only became the first member of her family to go to 
college, but she also went on to get a graduate degree, to teach high 
school chemistry, and to be named Teacher of the Year.

<p>

So, when Lydia Lowie was asked several years ago to give a
speech describing the most influential teacher in her life, most
expected the retired schoolteacher to wax eloquent about an inspiring
high school science instructor or a brilliant college chemistry
professor.

<p>

Instead, Lowie talked about her mother.  That's right, this
highly-accomplished schoolteacher who had for years paid dues
to a teacher's union that boasts, &quot;If you can read this,
thank a teacher,&quot; identified as her most influential instructor
a poor, simple woman with a high school education.[1]

<p>

While some might be tempted to dismiss Lowie's comments as
sweetly sentimental, the truth is mothers -- and fathers -- exert
far more influence over their children's intellectual development
than is commonly realized.  In fact, more than three decades of
research shows that families have greater influence over a child's
academic performance than any other factor -- including schools.

<font size=+1><b><i>
Families have greater influence<br>
over a child's academic performance<br>
than any other factor -- including<br>
schools.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Yet, curiously, almost all public discussion about improving
education in this country centers around school-based reforms
of one kind or another.  Unless and until our education debate
begins to focus on the family, significantly improving student
performance in America is likely to remain an elusive goal.

<p>

<center><h3>Family Matters</h3></center>

<p>

Just as Jed Clampett once discovered &quot;buffalo crude&quot;
while shooting for some food, much of the early research measuring
the extraordinary influence of family life on student achievement
was uncovered somewhat by accident.

<p>

In the mid-1960s, University of Chicago sociologist James
Coleman led a major research study designed to explain why students
in certain schools or in certain classes within a school perform
better, on average, than students attending other schools or other
classes.  Coleman's pioneering research weighed the relative influence
on student achievement of different school factors (such as per-pupil
spending and school size) as well as the influence of different
teacher variables (such as teacher experience and levels of education
completed).

<p>

While several school factors proved to have a modest effect
on student performance, they paled in comparison to the influence
of family background.  According to Coleman, there is a &quot;powerful
relation of the child's own family background characteristics
to his achievement, a relation stronger than that of any school
factors.&quot;[2]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
What families</i> do <i>really matters.<br>
Differences in student learning<br>
are not determined simply by the<br>
quality of one's gene pool or by<br>
which side of the tracks one lives<br>

learning stem significantly from the<br>
values, habits, and relational<br>
dynamics at work within the household.

Coleman's research spawned a number of studies replicating
his work and building upon it.  These studies consistently confirmed
Coleman's chief finding that families exert considerable influence
over student achievement.  For example, a 1984 research review
by the National Institute of Education concluded, &quot;Extensive,
substantial, and convincing evidence suggests that parents play
a crucial role in both the home and school environments with respect
to facilitating the development of intelligence, achievement,
and competence in children.&quot;[3] A 1993 survey of the research
literature by Benjamin Bloom and his colleagues reported, &quot;The
home environment is a most powerful factor in determining the
school learning of students -- their level of school achievement,
their interest in school learning, and the number of years of
schooling they will receive.[4] And a 1994 report issued by the
U.S. Department of Education noted, &quot;Thirty years of research
show that greater family involvement in children's learning is
a critical link to achieving a high-quality education ... controllable
home factors account for almost all the differences in average
student achievement.[5]

<p>

What is especially important about this body of research is
that it consistently shows that what families <I>do</I> really
matters.  That is, the research shows that differences in student
learning are not determined simply by the quality of one's gene
pool or by which side of the tracks one lives on.  Instead, differences
in child learning stem significantly from the values, habits and
relational dynamics at work within the household.

<p>

Indeed, a research review published in the <I>Phi Delta Kappan</I>
found that the home learning environment has an effect on achievement
that is at least twice as great as family social-economic status
(SES).[6] A Study commissioned by the Toronto Board of Education
found that parental encouragement at home and participation in
school activities have a more significant effect on children's
achievement than either SES or student ability.[7] And Bloom and
his colleagues summarize their findings by observing, &quot;Parents
from a variety of cultural backgrounds and with different levels
of education, income or occupational status can and do provide
stimulating home environments that support and encourage the learning
of their children.  It is what parents do in the home rather than
their status that is important.[8]

<p>

<center><h3>A Stimulating Home Environment</h3></center>

<p>

What characterizes the home learning environment in which children
are most likely to succeed?  In a 1994 review of the research
literature,[9] Anne Henderson and Nancy Berla of the National Committee
for Citizens in Education reported that children fare best when
their parents:

<p><ul>

<li>establish a daily family routine (including regular bedtimes
and times to study);

<p>

<li>monitor out-of-school activities (particularly television
viewing);

<p>

<li>model the value of learning, self-discipline and hard work
(especially through use of newspapers, encyclopedias, and other
home educational tools);

<p>

<li>express high but realistic expectations for achievement (and
reward success with special recognition);

<p>

<li>encourage children's development and progress in school (by
helping with homework, maintaining dialogue with teachers, and
the like);

<p>

<li>stimulate reading, writing, and discussions among family members
(including mealtime discussions, bedtime stories, and letters
to relatives); and

<p>

<li>facilitate use of community resources (such as libraries,
museums, sports programs, music lessons, and cultural events).

</ul><p>

That these &quot;home&quot; variables contribute to children's
learning should not surprise anyone.  What may surprise many,
however, is just how much difference &quot;home&quot; factors
can make.

<p>

Take, for example, family meals together.  While some might
consider this a rather trivial family ritual, several studies
have found the frequency of family meals together to be a strong
predictor of student test scores.[10] In explaining this high positive
correlation,  Chester Finn of the Hudson Institute says that consistent
mealtimes give parents regular opportunities to ask questions
about what kids are doing in school.  Mealtimes also give parents
regular opportunities to broaden children's educational horizons.
For example, Theodore Roosevelt's interest in public affairs
is said to have been cultivated by the rich dinnertime discussions 
his family regularly enjoyed when he was a boy.

<p>

Just as family interactions around the dinner table pay surprising
dividends, the number and variety of learning tools (books, tapes,
puzzles, encyclopedias, computers, and the like) in the home have
a far more profound effect on student achievement than is commonly 
realized. In his groundbreaking book, <I>School's Out</I>, Lewis 
Perelman of the Discovery Institute reports that data from the High 
School and Beyond Survey show that the number of learning tools 
available in the home is a much stronger predictor of academic 
achievement than factors such as whether parents expect 
children to attend college.[11] Moreover, Perelman argues that 
a much-publicized 1990 book by Terry Moe and John Chubb of 
the Brookings Institute underestimates the influence
of family factors on student achievement because it overlooks
data showing an extremely high correlation between schools with
high achievers and students who have an above average number of
learning tools in the home.[12]

<p>

Other studies also have found a high correlation between home
learning tools and student achievement.  For example, a report
issued by the Appalachia Educational Laboratory shows that apart
from fixed characteristics like family size and SES, student achievement
is influenced by variables like having books available, reading
to children, taking trips, and guiding TV watching.[13] A study of
third graders in southern California indicates that high achievers
are more likely than other students to spend time on homework,
to use the dictionary, and to take part in learning activities
with their parents.[14] And education analyst Ann Milne concludes
from her review of more than 100 studies, &quot;What is important
is the ability of the parent(s) to provide pro-educational resources
for their children -- be they financial, material, or experiential.&quot;[15]

<p>

Not surprisingly, the positive impact of home learning tools
is especially high when these materials are used in direct parent-child
interaction.  For example, a 1985 report from the National Academy
of Education found that the single most important activity for
building the knowledge required for eventual success in reading
is reading aloud to children.[16] Moreover, a 1992 study at the City
University of New York found that average IQ scores of low-income
preschoolers are boosted by nearly seven percentage points for
each day of the week that a mother reads to her child.[17]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The benefits of parent-child verbal interaction can also
be seen in recent research showing preschoolers placed in full-time
day care settings often lag behind their home-reared peers in
language development.  What is the primary reason for the difference?
Young children at home spend much of their day interacting verbally
with people (particularly Mom) whose language skills are more
advanced, whereas kids in day care spend most of their day interacting
verbally with peers whose language skills are no more developed
than their own.[18]

<p>

<center><h3>Structure Counts, Too</h3></center>

<p>

To say that family practices and processes make a significant
contribution to child learning does not imply that &quot;non-process&quot;
family factors (such as family income, size, structure, genetic
make-up, and parents' education) are somehow unimportant.  Indeed,
Milne reports that research consistently shows &quot;that both
males and females from single-parent families performed less well
than those from two-parent families.&quot;[19] A University of California
study shows that &quot;parent inputs do reduce the proportion
of low achievers, but they do not overcome the disadvantages of
low income.&quot;[20] Studies of twins suggest that genetic factors
account for at least one-third to one-half of the differences
in IQ scores.[21] And a study of Los Angeles elementary school students
finds that &quot;home process variables, parental responsibility
variables, and family background circumstances <I>worked together</I>
to shape student achievement patterns (emphasis added).&quot;[22]

<p>

These and other studies indicate that certain family structures
and backgrounds facilitate child learning more than others.  And
they suggest that the combined effect on student achievement of
&quot;process&quot; and &quot;non-process&quot; variables is most
apparent when either both sets of factors naturally pull in the
same direction (when, for example, highly-educated parents make
time to teach their children things at home) or when family roles
are adapted to facilitate home learning.

<p>

Consider, for example, the effect of family size on child learning.
For many years, researchers have reported that a child's learning
potential is threatened by the addition of new siblings to a household.
This notion that &quot;smaller families are better&quot; springs
from the fact that, in most American households, children are
primarily educational &quot;consumers&quot; taking from their
parents' learning resources, rather than significant &quot;producers&quot;
contributing to the family's overall learning environment.  When
children are given opportunities to contribute meaningfully to
the home learning environment, however, the negative effect of
increased family size can be eliminated  -- if not turned into
a positive.

<p>

That, at least, is one of the most important findings of a
fascinating 1992 University of Michigan study about the children
of Southeast Asian &quot;boat people&quot; who came to America
during the late 1970s and early 1980s.[23] This study found that
the refugee children's remarkable educational achievement (their
average scores were well above average in math and science, and
only slightly below average in reading and English) was due in
no small part to an effect similar to that found in the old one-room
schoolhouse.  Here's how the study's authors describe a typical
evening in a refugee home:  &quot;After dinner, the table is cleared,
and homework begins.  The older children, both male and female,
help their younger siblings.  Indeed, they seem to learn as much
from teaching as from being taught . . . [A] great amount of learning
goes on at these times -- in terms of skills, habits, attitudes,
and expectations as well as the content of a subject . . . Such
sibling involvement demonstrates how a large family can encourage
and enhance academic success.&quot;

<p>

Not only does this study of Indochinese refugee families challenge
prevailing assumptions about the educational impact of larger
family size, but it also challenges prevailing assumptions about
whether poorly-educated parents can contribute significantly to
their children's cognitive development.  Even though the refugee
parents had very limited English skills, they still enhanced their
children's literacy by reading to them.  In fact, &quot;the effects
of being read to held up statistically whether the children were
read to in English or in their native language,&quot; the University
of Michigan research team report.  &quot;This finding suggests
that parental English literacy skills may not play a vital role
in determining school performance.  Rather, other aspects of the
experience -- emotional ties between parent and child, cultural
validation and wisdom shared in stories read in the child's native
language, or value placed on reading and learning -- extend to
schoolwork.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>Policy Implications</h3></center>

<p>

Just as it is important for families to appreciate the magnitude
of their influence over child learning, it is also important for
education officials to design policies and programs that envision
parents playing a major role in their children's cognitive and
moral development.

<p>

Unfortunately, this occurs far too infrequently -- in part
because education officials have far less control over family
structures and processes (thankfully!) than over school policies
and procedures.

<p>

Yet, if hopes for reversing America's education decline are
to be realized, serious attention must be given to the role of
families in improving student performance.  As Bloom and his colleagues
acknowledge, &quot;It seems most unlikely that a significant improvement
in the quality of education for all students can be achieved without
active support from other quarters . . . particularly families.&quot;[24]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<font size=+1><b><i>

puzzles, encyclopedias, computers<br>

a far more profound effect on<br>
student achievement than is<br>
commonly realized.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

To that end, three reforms are especially needed:

<p>

<b><i>1. Redefine &quot;parental involvement&quot; to give emphasis
to the role parents play as their children's first and most important
teachers.</i></b> While virtually everyone these days supports greater
&quot;parental involvement&quot; in education, few Americans --
including many parents themselves -- really believe it is critical.
If educating children is a pot luck dinner, then most Americans
perceive that schools provide the &quot;meat and potatoes,&quot;
while families contribute the dessert.

<p>

This analogy can almost be taken literally.  In many places
today, &quot;parental involvement&quot; is defined to include
little more than making brownies for school bake sales, being
room mothers for class parties, volunteering to chaperone school
field trips, serving on school advisory committees, and attending
open houses, PTA meetings, sporting events, plays, and musical
performances.

<p>

While no one would dispute the legitimacy of some -- if not
all -- of these functions, it is instructive that most of these
traditional parental functions do not center around learning.
Indeed, traditional definitions of &quot;parental involvement&quot;
do not fully appreciate the instructional contribution parents
can and should make to their children's cognitive development.

<p>

This is unfortunate, for the instructional role of parents
is not only very important, but is often more appealing to families
than other forms of involvement.  &quot;What appears to be a crucial
role for black parents is their role as teachers in the home,&quot;
notes Jacqueline Jordan Irvine in her book, <I>Black Students
and School Failure</I>.  &quot;It is the role that parents prefer
and the one directly related to the achievement of their children.&quot;[25]

<p>

In fact, Irvine believes part of the reason many parents are
apathetic about serving on advisory boards and in other traditional
capacities is because they perceive that their roles on such committees
are &quot;marginal&quot; and that their participation has little
or no direct impact on the achievement of their children.

<p>

These observations are echoed in a study of nearly 5,000 elementary 
school parents by researchers Steven Melnick and Richard Fiene.
In a paper presented to the American Education Research Association,
Melnick and Fiene report that &quot;parents did not want to be
part of a 'professional-client' relationship with the school or
to be patronized in any way.&quot;[26]

<p>

&quot;Parents belong at the center of a young child's education,&quot;
says former U.S. Secretary of Education William Bennett.  &quot;The
single best way to improve elementary education is to strengthen
parents' role in it.&quot;[27]

<p>

<b><i>2. Refocus &quot;educational choice&quot; to give emphasis
to the way in which it increases parental involvement in education.</i></b>
Currently, the case for giving parents &quot;school choice&quot;
often emphasizes ways schools would improve in a competitive free
market environment.  If parents easily could move their children
from one school to another, the argument goes, then schools would
work harder to educate students, thereby raising the quality of
all schools.

<p>

There is nothing wrong with this argument.  Competition would
improve schools.  That is a bedrock free market principle.

<p>

But this is not the only (or even the most) compelling argument
for adopting an educational choice plan.  Just as a break-up of
the government school monopoly is apt to affect supply-side behavior
and give us better schools, it is also apt to affect demand-side
behavior and give us better families. If genuine &quot;educational
choice&quot; existed, parents would be active, discriminating
consumers of various educational options rather than passive recipients
of schooling chosen by government planners using proximity-is-destiny
guidelines.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
This research argues for<br>
policies which facilitate<br>
greater parental involvement<br>
in children's lives -- not<br>
year-round, all-day, cradle-<br>
to-college school programs<br>
that leave little time for<br>
families to learn together.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Indeed, no longer would parents enjoy the privilege of blaming
the government for supplying bad schools.  With parental choice
comes parental responsibility.  Ultimately, parents would be responsible
for the decisions they make -- whether those decisions produced
positive outcomes or negative ones.

<p>

In such an environment, parents undoubtedly would devote greater
time and attention to considering ways to improve their children's
academic outcomes.  They would carefully weigh the advantages
and disadvantages of different educational options -- and carefully
monitor the outcomes of various educational decisions.

<p>

And so long as the resources with which they have to work are
fungible, parents would be empowered to consider and pursue all
sorts of learning strategies that might benefit their children
-- including some that lie outside the realm of conventional schooling.

<p>

<b><i>3. Replace the existing model of education, which is heavily
based upon late-19th Century norms, with a new model designed
to seize 21st Century opportunities.</i></b> Several months before
issuing its much-publicized 1994 report on parental involvement,
the U.S. Department of Education issued a separate report that
said America's schoolchildren are &quot;prisoners&quot; of an
outmoded school schedule.[28] Specifically, the report said that
the typical nine-month school calendar (which was originally built
around the annual agricultural schedule) hinders learning continuity
and requires teachers to do considerable review after summer breaks.
The report also said the average school day ends before teachers
have adequate opportunity to cover all the subjects contemporary
schools seek to address -- and before many employed parents arrive
home from work.

<p>

Based on these observations, the report called for lengthening
the school day and the school year.  It also called for expanding
early childhood programs directed at preschoolers, in the name
of improving school readiness.

<p>

While at first blush these ideas may appear eminently reasonable,
their collective thrust towards more schooling fails to appreciate
the fact that data from the National Center for Education Statistics
show that U.S. students already rack up more &quot;seat&quot;
time in school each year than their counterparts in Japan, Germany,
England, Italy, Canada, and Korea. (Compared to others, however,
time in U.S. schools is more likely to be devoted to non-academic
pursuits like gym, driver's education, counseling, and assemblies.)[29]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
The result would be customized<br>
learning programs tailored to<br>
the unique needs of each child,<br>
with many part-time schooling<br>
options between the current<br>
polar opposites of 100 percent<br>
home schooling and 100 percent<br>
conventional schooling.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

More importantly, the drive for more schooling seems to be
at odds with the growing volume of research data showing how critically
important parental involvement is to children's learning.   Indeed,
this research argues for policies which facilitate greater parental
involvement in children's lives -- not year-round, all-day, cradle-to-college
school programs that leave little time for families to learn together.

<p>

Moreover, the most interesting educational trend in America
today -- the growth in home schooling -- is being driven both
by a frustration with rationalized, factory-style, morally-neutral
schooling and by a desire on the part of many parents to be highly
involved in the moral and cognitive development of their children.
What is especially interesting about this trend is the degree
to which some public school teachers have embraced it.

<p>

&quot;Family is the main engine of education,&quot; observed
junior high teacher John Taylor Gatto in a speech commemorating
his selection as New York City's Teacher of the Year. &quot;If
we use schooling to break children away from parents -- and make
no mistake, that has been the central function of schools since
John Cotton announced it as the purpose of the Bay Colony schools
in 1650 and Horace Mann announced it as the purpose of Massachusetts
schools in 1850 -- we're going to continue to have the horror
show we have right now.&quot;[30]

<p>

Gatto finds it &quot;curious&quot; that the literacy rate in
Massachusetts prior to compulsory attendance laws was 98 percent
-- seven percentage points higher than it has been at any point
since.  And he finds it &quot;curious&quot; that home-schooled
students score significantly better than their conventionally-schooled
peers on achievement tests.  Indeed, a 1990 study of more than
1,500 randomly-selected home-schooling families found that home-educated
students score, on average, at or above the 80th percentile in
all areas of standardized achievement tests.[31]

<p>

While conceding that we won't &quot;get rid of schools anytime
soon,&quot; Gatto says greater attention needs to be given to
facilitating learning opportunities that bring parents and children
together.  &quot;The curriculum of family is at the heart of any
good life,&quot; says Gatto.  &quot;The way to sanity in education
is for our schools to take the lead in releasing the stranglehold
of institutions on family life.&quot;[32]

<p>

Similarly, Seattle public school teacher David Guterson says
&quot;the notion of parents as educators of their children is,
in the broad sense, neither extreme nor outlandish.&quot;  Indeed,
Guterson points out that &quot;homeschooled children learn under
the ideal conditions that schoolteachers persistently cry out
for.&quot;[33]

<p>

In a compelling essay for <I>Harper's</I> magazine, Guterson
writes, &quot;Today it is considered natural for parents to leave
their children's education entirely in the hands of institutions.
In a better world, we [parents] would see <I>ourselves</I> as
responsible and our schools primarily as resources.  Schools would
cease to be <I>places</I> in the sense that prisons and hospitals
are places; instead education would be embedded in the life of
the community . . . Parents would measure their inclinations and
abilities and immerse themselves, to varying degrees and in varying
ways, in a larger educational system designed to <i>assist</i> them.
Schools -- educational resource centers -- would provide materials,
technology, and expertise instead of classrooms, babysitters,
and bureaucrats.&quot;

<p>

Guterson's vision of schools as interactive &quot;educational
resource centers&quot; is shared by Lewis Perelman, a former high
school physics teacher in New York state.  Indeed, Perelman believes
the era of conventional classroom-style schooling is coming to
a close, giving way to a variety of &quot;hyperlearning&quot;
strategies better suited to the computer-driven, information age
in which we now live.[34]

<p>

For families to be able to take full advantage of emerging
learning opportunities, Perelman believes school choice -- a one
time decision at the beginning of the school year -- will not
be enough.  Instead, he says parents will want and need to make
educational &quot;choices&quot; on an ongoing basis, much as they
do currently in other realms of economic activity.

<p>

Obviously, different families would answer education questions
differently, just as different families currently answer transportation
questions differently.  Some would lean heavily on do-it-yourself
strategies (driving oneself, teaching one's own), others would
depend heavily on outside services (taking the bus, enrolling
in classes).  But this model of education would be highly flexible
and adaptable.  Rather than offering a one-size-fits-all public
school monopoly, this new model would accommodate the different
needs and interests of different families.
<p>

The result would be &quot;customized&quot; learning programs
tailored to the unique needs of each child, with many &quot;part-time&quot;
schooling options between the current polar opposites of 100 percent
homeschooling and 100 percent conventional schooling.

<p>

<center><h3>Reviving Tuition Tax Credits</h3></center>

<p>

Quite appropriately, this new model would make parents the
principal educational decision-makers.  This doesn't mean that
parents would be experts in every educational subject any more
than consumers of microwave ovens are experts in microwave technology.
It simply means parents would be primarily responsible for the
moral and cognitive development of their 6-18 year-olds, just
as they currently are primarily responsible for the moral and
cognitive development of their children under the age of six.

<p>

And it means education policy-makers increasingly would need
to replace direct funding of schools with tax credits that empower
parents.  Tax credits are superior to vouchers as a means of empowering
families for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that
tax credits are more fungible.  Indeed, one of the reasons college
tuition expenses have increased at such a rapid rate in recent
years is because so many students partially or completely pay
for their higher education with non-fungible grants, loans, or
scholarships. Since college officials know that student aid
cannot be used for any other purpose, they have an easier time
increasing tuition expenses than would be the case if a larger
share of tuition expenses were being paid with cash that could
be used for other purposes.

<p>

How might a fungible educational tax credit initially be structured?
Perhaps the best plan would be modeled after the federal tax
code's current treatment of tax deductions. That is, the federal 
government could offer a &quot;standard&quot; educational tax credit 
of say, $400 per-child to all parents who have school-aged children, 
and an &quot;itemized&quot; educational tax credit option of up to
say, $1,600 per child would be available to families that
incur significant educational expenses for which they have receipts.
This would give all parents a hassle-free means of investing
in their children's education by doing things like purchasing
home learning tools (books, puzzles, computer equipment, art supplies,
etc.), and paying tuition expenses (for conventional classroom
instruction and/or for special learning opportunities like dance
lessons or summer camp).

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Funding such a plan could come from the existing expenditures
made by the federal government for education-related programs.

<p>

State governments could offer similar programs, drawing upon
resources saved from lower enrollment in all-day public schools
and from other sources.

<p>

To be sure, these ideas would not be popular with teachers'
union leaders, federal education bureaucrats, and other parts
of the &quot;education blob&quot; as Bennett is fond of calling
it.  But folks like Keith Geiger (head of the National Education
Association) can't have it both ways.  If, as Gieger has argued,
&quot;the most effective and cost efficient place for children
to acquire the foundation for learning and moral values is in
the home,&quot;  then it stands to reason that solutions to America's
education problems ought to be primarily home-based, not school-based.[35]

<p>

Certainly, parental empowerment strategies would benefit children
coming from strong families.

<p>

But these strategies would also benefit children coming from
disadvantaged environments whose educational experiences would
become more &quot;customized&quot; as learning opportunities become
more varied and tailored to the individual.

<p>

To be sure, some children would still fall through the cracks.
But the grim reality of education in America today is that many,
many children are already falling through the cracks.  And many,
many more will do so in the future if we continue to focus our
education debate on schools instead of families.

<p>

&quot;We should think clearly about the problems of schools
[and] ask ourselves why every attempt to correct them seems doomed
to fail,&quot;  Guterson writes.  &quot;We should recognize that
schools will never solve the bedrock problems of education.&quot;[36]

<p>

Only families can. Only families will.

<p>

That is the lesson Guterson believes Americans need to learn.
If indeed we learn it, this time we really should thank a teacher.

This unassuming doorway is the entrance to the New Conservative World.  Town Hall was created in 1991 to serve as the meeting place for conservatives.  It began as a small BBS network and grew to become a CompuServe forum and the premier conservative site on the internet.  Launched on June 29th, 1995, Town Hall had 12 citizen organizations at a kickoff party attended by Speaker Newt Gingrich and then Majority Leader Bob Dole.

<p>

Heading into 1997, Town Hall has over 30 citizen organizations, over 30 columnists, and a new feature "<a href="http://www.townhall.com/thcc/"><i>The Conservative Current</i></a>" which is a subscriber service featuring 18 syndicated columnists such as Bob Novak, Tony Snow and Dan Quayle.<p>

Town Hall builds and maintains conservative organization's web sites and Town Hall's own orginal and syndicated content as a service to the conservative movement.
<p>
Located on the third
floor of <a href="http://www.heritage.org">The Heritage Foundation</a>, in Washington, DC, these offices house the nerve center of
Town Hall, including the most sophisticated computer equipment available...and some really
cool people.  Don't bother knocking, just come right in!  <p>

<title>THE GREATEST OF THESE IS LOVE</title>

<body>

<center>

<h1>The Greatest of These is Love</h1>
<h2><i>A Faith-Based Alternative to the Welfare State</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>I</font>n an 1844 essay entitled &quot;True and False 
Philanthropy,&quot; American preacher William H. McGuffey unwittingly 
diagnosed the ills of the modern welfare state.  McGuffey draws a 
contrast between a &quot;Mr. Fantom&quot; and a &quot;Mr. Goodman.&quot; 
Mr. Fantom begins: &quot;I despise a narrow field.  O for the reign of 
universal benevolence!  I want to make all mankind good and happy.&quot;
Mr. Goodman responds that &quot;one must begin to love somewhere;
and I think it is natural to love one's own family, and to do
good in one's own neighborhood, as to anybody else.&quot;  Mr.
Goodman laments of Mr. Fantom, &quot;And so, between the great
thing he cannot do, and the little one that he will not do, life
passes, and nothing will be done.&quot;

<p>

Today, the onset of moral relativism has driven a wedge between
those reformers who hope to promote moral uplift and those who
aim only to relieve material needs.  But in 1844, Mr. Fantom and
Mr. Goodman did at least agree that the object of benevolence
was &quot;goodness&quot; and &quot;happiness&quot; -- or, in more
sophisticated parlance, virtue and individual fulfillment.  Mr.
Fantom and Mr. Goodman parted ways in defining the means to achieve
those ends, and their differences frame the central questions
confronting contemporary reformers.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

First, should the locus of our action be the individual or
the collectivity?  And are we intent upon &quot;making all mankind
good&quot; by coercion, as Mr. Fantom aspired, or in &quot;doing
good&quot; in the context of freedom, along with Mr. Goodman?

<p>

Simply limiting the size of the welfare state will not yield
a sparkling rebirth in the nation's naked cities.  Limiting government
will be necessary, but not sufficient, to repair cultural rot.
The insufficiency of libertarian means, however, does not imply
the existence of some proactive political means that will be adequate
to the task.  Restoring our society will require embracing a vision
of moral autonomy and inherent dignity for every individual.

<p>

<center><h3>Individual or Collectivity?</h3></center>

<p>

Nature has revealed two fundamental truths about man.  He
is perpetually weak and flawed, but also rife with potential for
love and renewal.  Personal failing, in fact, often contains the
seeds of renewal because it discredits an exalted sense of the
self.  By reflecting on the dynamics of human weakness, reason
itself can apprehend a higher law rooted in God, to whom man must
hold himself accountable.

<p>

Conservative theorist Frank Meyer argues that the cornerstone
of civic morality in the West is the Great Commandment &quot;to
love the Lord thy God with all thy heart . . . and thy neighbor
as thyself.&quot;  In reflecting on this mandate, Meyer introduces
a paradox.  By ignoring utterly everything but God and individual
persons, the world's most famous invocation to selflessness has
established the individual squarely at the center of the Western
tradition.  The individual must be &quot;the central moral entity,
and society as but a set of relations between persons -- not as
an organism morally superior to persons,&quot;[1] Meyer writes, because
&quot;no community, no state, no association -- only persons,
individual human beings -- can receive the beatific vision or
be redeemed by the divine sacrifice of love.&quot;[2] The words
are radical in implication.  They ask those who believe in the
divine sacrifice of love to acknowledge that healing the culture
will depend on the interaction of individuals, not the clash of
abstract political entities.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Should the locus of our action<br>
be the individual or the collectivity?<br>
And are we intent upon 'making<br>
all mankind good' by coercion,<br>
or in 'doing good' in the context<br>
of freedom?
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The concept of &quot;interaction,&quot; of course, is a necessary
corollary to the emphasis on the individual.  Meyer's vision of
social harmony, after all, rests on a vision of the individual
redeemed, and man is redeemed only by acquiring a sense of something
larger than himself.  Through a rich and vast array of daily interactions
with each other, individuals mature into complete human beings
with a sense of self-control, but also a sense of connectedness
and mutual obligation.  The state's role in fostering man's nobler
impulses depends ultimately on nurturing, not individuals directly,
but all the small groupings into which human beings organize themselves
-- outside of and distinct from government.

<p>

The moral superiority of individuals meeting each other face
to face, in the space we call &quot;civil society,&quot; emerges
with particular force in the story of a woman named Clara Hale.
A poor woman in her mid-sixties, living in a poor neighborhood,
Clara Hale took in a baby born with a drug addiction and went
on to found Hale House, a group home for addicted children in
Harlem.  &quot;It was Clara Hale who did this,&quot; Michael Joyce
writes, &quot;not an expert, not a bureaucracy.  Had she exercised
her citizenship in the modern, tragically devalued sense of that
term, Clara Hale would merely have advocated through voting and
political activism, more programs for state-funded professionals
to care for these children of God.&quot;  But she did not turn
away from them and speak to society, in the abstract.  She held
each child, one by one, and spoke their names to them.  &quot;Clara
Hale's sense of citizenship, her active and direct participation
in service to her fellow man, displays the vibrancy and proves
the superiority of civil society,&quot;[3] Joyce concludes.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<font size=+1><b><i>
Virtue depends on individual<br>
freedom of choice and can<br>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The proliferation of need is a cry for a new generation of
Clara Hale's, with an acutely personal sense of moral responsibility.

<p>

<center><h3>Freedom or coercion?</h3></center>

<p>

If the moral development of the individual is the central
concern, then liberty and virtue must be the twin ordering principles
of political and social life.  The pursuit of virtue is the highest
moral good, but it cannot be a political question.  Virtue depends
on individual freedom of choice and can be neither exercised by
collectivities nor achieved by political coercion.  F. A. Hayek
once wrote:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

Freedom is the matrix required for the growth of moral values
-- indeed not merely one value among many but the source of all
values.  It is only where the individual has choice, and its inherent
responsibility, that he has occasion to affirm existing values,
to contribute to their further growth, and to earn moral merit.[4]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

The only political means to promote virtue, then, is to establish
and maintain freedom for the individual.

<p>

If virtue depends on the preservation of liberty, however,
it is also true that the maintenance of liberty depends on the
status of virtue.  The meaning of freedom encompasses much more
than the absence of coercion or an abundance of options.  Because
a democratic society requires citizens to be capable of governing
themselves, freedom cannot be an end in itself.  As Lord Acton
put it, &quot;Liberty is not the freedom to do what you wish;
it is the freedom to do what you ought.&quot;  Libertarian means,
in short, must serve traditionalist ends, while traditionalism
must resist the temptation to use coercion to promote its own
ends.

<p>

The only satisfactory balance between virtue and freedom
is a vibrant civil society, that sphere of life that includes
all the institutions and interactions that stand between the individual
and the total state.  While the elemental building blocks are
the family and the church, civil society also encompasses the
Boy Scout troop that builds hiking trails for the community, the
school that teaches young ones how to read, and the homeless shelter
that keeps its doors open thanks to dedicated volunteers.  Civil
society may be as formal as the Red Cross chapter that has secured
its 501 (c)(3) tax status or as informal as an afternoon gathering
of young mothers at a neighborhood park.  It is both Hale House
and your house.  Sharing stories around the dinner table, holding
hands with a new widow, or looking men directly in the eye at
the local soup kitchen -- this is the stuff that softens hearts
and melts social barriers.  By maximizing opportunities for service
to one another, civil society promotes the strength of character
that safeguards against freedom's atomistic tendencies.

<p>

The freedom that allows civil society to thrive is, in fact,
much more likely to engender strong communities than the isolated
individuals of liberal myth-making, for human nature predisposes
man to live life in communal settings.  Alexis de Tocqueville
wrote in <i>Democracy in America</i>:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

The township is . . . so well rooted in nature that wherever men
assemble it forms itself.  Communal society therefore exists among
all peoples, whatever be their customs and laws.  Man creates
kingdoms and republics, but townships seem to spring directly
from the hand of God.[5]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

The prospects for civil society do depend critically, however,
on the preservation of the nuclear family as the basic unit of
society.

<p>

<center><h3>A Revival of Family</h3></center>

<p>

While his name is almost synonymous with self-interest, Adam
Smith also observed a near-universal human attribute of sympathy
that he identified as the source of human moral sentiments.  Although
distinct from altruism, Smith's notion of &quot;sympathy&quot;
inspired man to seek the approval of his fellow citizens by functioning
in ways that sustained healthy communities.  Endorsing Smith's
hypothesis, John Adams wrote in 1790 that &quot;as Nature intended
men for society, she has endowed them with passions, appetites
and propensities calculated . . . to render them useful to each
other in their social connections&quot;[6] -- if only to win the
love and esteem that gratify the self.

<font size=+1><b><i>

between virtue and freedom is<br>
a vibrant civil society, that<br>

state.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Along with the right of man to be free and independent, the
Founders asserted a strong belief that man was most magnanimous
when functioning as a free individual.  Jefferson for his part
argued that men have an instinctive moral sense that compels them
to respond with assistance when their neighbors are in distress.[7]
In examining the scientific evidence to test Jefferson's contention,
James Q. Wilson found ample evidence that individuals do have
a &quot;moral sense&quot; and that it is formed out of their earliest
interactions in the family.  Scholarly studies of altruism, for
example, demonstrate that &quot;the general pattern of warm familial
relationships is striking.&quot;  In a study of Christians who
rescued Jews during the Holocaust, the long-term rescuers were
very close to their parents, one or both of whom held strong moral
convictions.  And the same pattern reappears in a study of people
who were active for long periods in the civil rights movement
during the 1960s.  Compared to those who were only briefly involved,
the fully committed activists had a warm and close relationship
with one or both parents.[8]

<p>

By fostering human relationships of a type that are not always
found in the wider society, the family fulfills an indispensable
social function.  As the Pope wrote in <I>Familiaris Consortio</I>:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

The relationships between members of the family community are
inspired and guided by the law of &quot;free giving.&quot;  By
respecting and fostering personal dignity in each and every one
as the only basis for value, this free giving takes the form of
heartfelt acceptance, encounter and dialogue, disinterested availability,
generous service and deep solidarity.[9]

</i>

</blockquote>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

In reviewing a wide variety of studies in developmental psychology,
Wilson found that generous children were indeed raised by parents
who offered nurturing love and consistent discipline and who themselves
engaged in helping others.  Rather than caring intensely only
for members of the immediate family, children and adults who experienced
love at home were precisely the people who were most likely to
aid perfect strangers, often at risk to themselves.[10]

<p>

The empirical evidence, then, provides a powerful rebuttal
to the conception of the moral agent as an abstract force, stripped
of the intimacy and particularity of the family ties that undergird
moral experience in everyday life.  Michael Novak argues that
moral realism itself is the one habit learned in the family that
is most essential for successful self-government:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

[F]amily life is no utopia.  It isn't meant to be.  Its purpose
is to instruct us in the painful but also mind-enlarging angularities
of human nature.  Such realism, vital to any free republic, arises
from having your own self-images punctured, from learning to endure
tragedies together, from penetrating one another's weaknesses,
and from learning to forgive, to love, to be tolerant, and to
support.  Without such learning how could any civil society survive?[11]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

In order to have meaningful content, love for humanity, for the
stranger on the street corner, must evolve from the privilege
of basic human affections -- the experience of one heart knowing
another.

<p>

While grounded in moral realism, acts of personal kindness
elevate and ennoble the doer from within; and in learning the
unique worth of love, theologian Walter Rauschenbusch observed,
we learn to feel the worth of those we ought to love.[12] Thus, love
undergirds both moral autonomy and a sense of the dignity that
belongs to every individual.  Political coercion, by contrast,
is a flimsy tool for social cohesion.  &quot;The frequency with
which our communities have to fall back on . . . coercion is a
symptom of the failure of love, for love can usually dispense
with force.  The more love, the less force; the more force, the
less love,&quot;[13] Rauschenbusch wrote.

<p>

To the extent that centralized government usurps the space
in which families and neighbors thrive -- and thereby politicizes
all relationships -- it trumpets reductionist individualism and
denies the power of love.  Collectivism makes its mistake in assuming
that virtues like selflessness and generosity are a part of human
nature.  Asserting that man has a moral sense (or a variation
on self-interest that mimics a moral sense) is not to say that
man is inherently virtuous or altruistic.  If men were angels,
the loss of family would exact no price.

<p>

<center><h3>A Revival of Community</h3></center>

<p>

It is also true, however, that strong families require strong
communities.  Charles Murray explains that &quot;[a]ffiliation
is a means whereby people of common values are enabled to enact
those values.&quot;[14] A functioning community that promotes a wide
array of affiliations provides an extremely important venue both
for practicing virtue and for passing down to the next generation
the habit of virtue.  The passing of values from parent to child,
in fact, presupposes outlets for practice because it involves
-- as Murray puts it -- a &quot;reality test.&quot;

<p><blockquote>

<i>

How does one bequeath a habit of helping others, of giving, of
generosity, if this has not been a part of one's own life? . . . 
Watching parents support compassionate politicians just isn't
the same. . . .  If parents are engaged in directly paying other
people in the community -- supporting local institutions -- they
at least must do such things as choose whom they will pay and
how much.  And even these actions provide a richer basis for instruction
than signing a 1040 Form and then trying to explain compassion
to the child in the abstract.[15]

Wilson's empirical findings concur: generous children are
in fact the sons and daughters of generous parents.  He also discovers,
however, that human sympathy is fragile.  Behavior depends, not
only on the development of right instinct, but on the extent to
which the circumstances create a sense of personal responsibility.
Adam Smith devised a famous thought experiment to demonstrate
the point:  If a man were to learn of the destruction of 100 million
Chinese, he might lament their passing, but in a moment would
return placidly to his business or leisure.  But we would recoil
at the thought of a man who in order to save the loss of his little
finger would will the death of the very same number of distant
Chinese. &quot;If our sentiments were directed simply by our
love of humanity,&quot; Wilson observes, &quot;we might feel equal
anguish at both tragedies, but we do not.&quot;[16] Adam Smith provides
the explanation:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

When the happiness or misery of others depends in any respect
upon our conduct, we dare not, as self-love might suggest to us,
prefer the interest of one to that of many.  The man within 
immediately calls.[17]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

Conversely, when the happiness or misery of others bears no relation
to our conduct, the man within remains silent.

<p>

Given the evidence that there is a &quot;man within,&quot;
the more appropriate question is -- not whether human beings are
capable of strong community -- but why do we not see more evidence
of community already in play.[18] The answer reflects Adam Smith's
insight about human nature, for civil institutions by definition
are groupings of flesh-and-blood men.  To the extent that the
welfare state has eliminated the necessity of a father who provides,
it has reduced the sense of personal responsibility that kept
him at home through good times and bad.  To the extent that Washington
hires social workers to do the job instead, Sioux City will almost
certainly experience a decline in the numbers of men and women
who feel compelled to volunteer their time at the end of a long
day.  In the words of Nathan Glazer, the reason social policy
weakens civil institutions is

<p><blockquote>

<i>

the simple reality that every piece of social policy substitutes
for some traditional arrangement, whether good or bad, a new arrangement
in which public authorities take over, at least in part, the role
of the family, of the ethnic and neighborhood group, of the voluntary
associations.[19]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

In Marvin Olasky's turn of phrase, bad charity drives out good.

<center><h3>A Revival of Faith</h3></center>

<p>

When families no longer have the benefit of strong communities
-- and many children no longer even have the benefit of family
-- reviving civil society is admittedly more complex than merely
relimiting the size of the welfare state.  Pulling out the knife,
as Professor DiIulio says, is unlikely to resuscitate the dying
man.[20] But neither will a fresh stab wound do the trick.  Civil
society must derive its strength from non-political sources, and
in all probability those sources must spring from a revival of
religious faith.  Relimiting government is essential precisely
because government can stultify, but never revivify, religion.

When public order is lost and the center does not hold, fidelity
to truth demands at least weighing the evidence that faith-based
drug addiction programs save more lives than their secular counterparts.[21]
Short of rigorous empirical calculations, fidelity to the truth
demands engaging in a simple thought experiment:  &quot;If you
are walking down the street in urban America and see four formidable-looking
young males approaching, would you relax a little if you knew
they had just emerged from a Bible study?&quot;  Probably, yes.
The federal government's own surveys of the professional literature
confirm that attachment to church is inversely related to violence.[22]
Given the scale of the current crisis and the clarity of the
evidence in defense of faith, many secular authorities are willing
to give religion its due.  The danger is not simply that government
will soften its bias against faith-based programs too late, but
that government dollars will disarm the very emphasis on faith
that made those programs a success in the first place.

<p>

Government contracting with community-based institutions,
including religious institutions, will almost certainly result
in a more efficient and effective delivery of services.  The issue
at hand, however, is neither efficiency nor material quality.
The issue is transforming lives ravaged, not by a lack of material
resources, but by a lack of the spiritual and moral fiber necessary
to sustain independence.  In a comprehensive study of religious
charities, Amy Sherman concludes:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

The most effective groups challenge those who embrace faith to
live out its moral implications in every significant area of their
lives, from breaking drug addictions and repairing family relationships
to recommitting themselves to the value of honest work.  But state
social-service contracts aren't necessarily concerned with such
outcomes; they focus on meals served, beds available, and checks
cashed.[23]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

Faith-based programs, like men, cannot serve both God and mammon
too.

<p>

Even programs that retain their original vision are likely
to face burdensome regulations that dilute the emphasis on faith.
In explaining why faith-based programs succeed when state-licensed
versions fail, Ed MacClellan, executive director of the Florida
Association of Christian Child Caring Agencies (FACCCA) summarizes
his experience in plain, unvarnished English:  &quot;'In the licensed
homes you'll find Jesus, but you'll have to look for him.  He's
put away in the chapel or in a closet. . . .   Go to one of our
homes, and Jesus is gonna open the front door. That's the 
difference.'&quot;[24] Regardless of right or wrong, the fact is that 
Jesus is unlikely to be opening the door at a public housing project any 
time soon. Faith-minded policymakers must accept that limitation for the
present, and plan accordingly.

<p>

While the loss of a programmatic emphasis on religion is
the most obvious compromise, government funding also changes the
quality of personal relationships in subtle ways that can undercut
any remaining vestiges of faith.  Government paperwork diverts
time from the face-to-face ministry that is the single most important
corrective to the bureaucratic model -- and the most likely avenue
to spiritual renewal.  Quite often the very thing needed, says
Virgil Gulker, founder of Kids/Hope/USA, is simply &quot;a person
who cares, befriending another person who is lonely.&quot;[25] Star
Parker, former welfare recipient, says from personal experience
that the question posed to welfare recipients must be: &quot;God
or government?&quot;[26] But government money damages the credibility
of the personal example individual volunteers can set for the
beneficiaries of their programs.  Reverend Eddie Edwards, who
oversees a community-development organization in east Detroit
called Joy of Jesus, explains: &quot;When we are working with
people in the community, helping them become self-sufficient,
helping them get off welfare, it would be extremely difficult
to tell them to get off welfare if we were on some kind of public
assistance.&quot;[27] Indeed, the most powerful witness men and women
of faith can offer is that dependence on God obviates the need
for dependence on the state.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

As long as state funding remains a part of the landscape,
the church may do good works, but it will fail to realize its
full potential as the vital center of community life.  The heart
of Charles Murray's argument about the prospects for a rebirth
of civil society must be applied with particular urgency to the
institution that is charged with remoralizing civil society.
&quot;The church will be a satisfying institution of community
life (not just religious life) to the extent that the members
have something important to do&quot; -- that will not otherwise
be done.  But &quot;that institutional role will atrophy to the
extent that it does not.&quot;[28] Just as it will be impossible
to secure the benefits of community on the cheap, it will prove
impossible to restore the influence of faith in America without
churchgoers paying a rather steep price to vindicate that faith
in their own lives, day by day.

<p>

Lest the burden seem too overwhelming, Virgil Gulker places
the problem in perspective:  &quot;Somehow the statistics cover
up the fact that behind every number is a name and a face -- a
real person with a real need.  Categories and percentages seem
beyond our grasp, but individuals can be helped.&quot;[29] Faith
believes that the power of just one changed life is in fact more
powerful than an activist state.

<p>

Ultimately, collectivism itself is at war with faith; for,
it is a vision not of individuals finding love and renewal in
the presence of God, but of godlike individuals contriving the
salvation of the masses.  To vindicate the exaltation of an elite
-- often in the face of demonstrated failures to deliver the promised
goods -- collectivism insists upon an abstraction called &quot;society&quot;
to which all moral problems finally refer.  By absolving individuals
of personal responsibility, collectivism enervates the faith that
springs from man's reckoning with his own inadequacy.  But it
also leaves real, flesh-and-blood individuals hurting, by decreasing
the likelihood that men will stir themselves to serve each other
at the deepest point of need.  As Mr. Goodman lamented of Mr.
Fantom, &quot;Between the great thing [man] cannot do, and the
little one that he will not do, life passes, and nothing will
be done.&quot;

<center><h3>What Can Be Done?</h3></center>

<p>

In short, a myriad of the &quot;little things&quot; that
together will equal more than the sum of the parts.  In 1976,
Dr. Virgil Gulker founded an organization called Love, Inc. that
seeks to bridge the gap between needy individuals and suburban
church members.  Someone once observed that Love, Inc. is distinctive
because it has no heroes.  Its sole purpose is to mobilize ordinary
individuals to serve the poor, by making the needs both specific
and manageable and by providing the appropriate training for volunteers.
Today, some 4,000 churches nationwide are involved in Love, Inc.,
while other individuals like Reverend Ronald Moore in Jackson,
Mississippi are developing their own training curriculum to help
mobilize a critical mass of churches.

<p>

Dr. Gulker, for his part, has launched a new venture called
Kids/Hope/USA that links adult volunteers in one-to-one relationships
with at-risk children.  Echoing Wilson's empirical findings, Dr.
Gulker speaks from experience: &quot;[When] suffering people remain
nameless and faceless, a mass 'out there' who do not activate
our sense of personal responsibility, . . . [w]hen we lack direct
contact with people's pain, their needs become merely one item
on our agenda -- and not necessarily an important item. . . .
Thus ministry shaped by distance . . . is fatal to those in need.&quot;[30]
Ministry to individuals one by one, on the other hand, is life-giving.
Americans have grown too accustomed to sweeping government action,
aimed at amorphous collective masses.  We must learn to see social
problems as individual responsibilities, but first we must affix
names and faces to the need.

<p>

Secondly, we must find ways to divert economic resources
from failed government programs to successful private-sector initiatives.
But a word of caution at the outset.

<p>

Welfare state advocates often defend bureaucratic programs
by arguing that the private sector cannot possibly replicate existing
levels of government spending.  &quot;Based on the current welfare
model,&quot; Father Robert Sirico replies, &quot;they are right.
All levels of government spend $950 billion a year on welfare
programs.  Charities, excluding churches, spend less than half
this sum (about $360 billion).  Private efforts clearly cannot
assume the functions of the present welfare state.  But why should
they?  An annual welfare budget of $300 billion is roughly three
times the amount of money it would take to raise the incomes of
all poor people above the poverty line.&quot;[31]

The welfare delivery system, like any other bureaucracy-laden
government monopoly, is woefully inefficient.  One study found
that less than 35 cents out of every welfare dollar was paid in
cash directly to the needy.[32] And every year, welfare consumes
more tax dollars without any incentives to cut costs or monitor
results.  In the words of Indianapolis Mayor Steve Goldsmith,
&quot;The federal government offers the best deal in town:  The
more you spend, the more you get. Don't worry about results.&quot;[33]
The national average spending for government-subsidized homeless
shelters is $22 per person per day.  By contrast, Sister Connie
Driscoll operates St. Martin de Porres House of Hope, a homeless
shelter in Chicago, at an average cost of $6.73 per person per
day.  Sister Connie receives no government funding.  But she does
get results.  The House of Hope has the most impressive success
rate in Chicago.  Only 6 percent of its residents find themselves
on the street again.

<p>

The key to success, of course, is that Sister Connie sets
behavioral standards for the receipt of assistance.  The changes
in behavior pose savings over and above the dollars saved by a
more efficient delivery of goods and services.  In a monograph
entitled &quot;The Market Foundations of Philanthropy,&quot; Richard
McKenzie explains:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

The donors' demands for reforms on the part of recipients carry
weight for a simple reason:  the recipients understand that the
private aid can be withdrawn (without an act of Congress), which
means that private aid is much more likely to be performance-based
and cost-effective.[34]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

Just as government bureaucrats treat the agency budget as
a proxy goal to be maximized, recipients of open-ended checks
face their own perverse incentives to perpetuate the very behavior
that drains the tax dollars of millions of hard-working Americans
year after year.  The tax burden in turn undermines the economic
expansiveness that could create jobs -- and fund additional philanthropic
giving.[35]

<p>

Just as the private sector need not replace the welfare state
dollar for dollar, efforts to build private sector capacity do
not depend on an increase in charitable giving by every American.
Only a reasonable percentage of the population must participate.
And voluntary giving is certainly an attractive alternative to
taxation.  Far from serving as an efficient way to raise money
for public purposes, taxation hurts the economy by creating a
disincentive effect for production as well as a new layer of compliance
costs.  Both costs disappear under a voluntary system.  Until
the twentieth-century love affair with government, James Payne
notes in <I>The Public Interest</I>, logic dictated that voluntarism
was the &quot;principal way money was raised for social purposes.&quot;[36]

<p>

Despite the growing bite of government taxation, recent levels
of charitable giving remain impressive.  If the value of volunteer
labor is included, the current value of private charity exceeds
all government welfare spending combined.[37] Payne concludes:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

[Academic preoccupation with the free-rider problem] overlooks
the complexity of human behavior.  Human beings can be generous
as well as selfish, and this generosity makes possible the hundreds
of thousands of voluntary giving arrangements that we see all
across the country. . . . The moral power of this kind of voluntary
transaction can never be achieved with a tax system based on force.
. . .  It is worth speculating how such giving might thrive in
a society that decided to emphasize it, in a society where children
were taught, from their earliest days, that voluntary giving is
needed to sustain civilization.[38]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

Charitable activity does appear to correlate closely with
a coherent system of beliefs.  <I>The American Enterprise</I>
reports that government-shrinking conservatives are more than
twice as likely to volunteer time and likely to give more than
twice as big a percentage of their annual incomes to charity.
The most generous subgroup within the population is religious
conservatives.[39]

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Research shows, moreover, that giving patterns among individual
Americans have changed along with changes in the role of government.
From the early 1940s through 1964, as the U.S. grew wealthier,
an increasing portion of wealth was given to charities.  In the
mid-1960s, however, the trend was reversed -- despite the fact
that total wealth continued to increase.  A rise in charitable
giving did not reappear until 1981 (during a period of hard times,
incidentally) when the Reagan Administration proposed cuts in
social welfare spending and urged a return to voluntarism.[40] Richard
McKenzie has demonstrated that, as a result, charitable giving
by Americans in the 1980s increased by all possible measures,[41]
while voluntarism made a resurgence among both college students
and professionals.  In 1979, about 300 companies had programs
to encourage workers to participate in community service projects.
By the late 1980s, the number had increased to 600, and at least
200 companies were sending workers into the community on company
time.  Between 1984 and 1989, the number of Americans reporting
charitable volunteer work in Gallup polls rose from 34 percent
to 50 percent.[42]

<p>

Anecdotal evidence from more recent experiments also indicates
that private giving increases in response to cuts in public funding.
In reaction to a Wisconsin Supreme Court injunction against Milwaukee's
newly-expanded school-choice program, which allows parents to
use vouchers at private sectarian schools, residents throughout
the state donated more than $1.2 million to help children stay
in the schools of their choice.[43] And the Public Broadcasting Service
reports a 12 percent increase in private giving over last year.
Federal funds for PBS are scheduled to decrease 6 percent in
1996 and more in 1997.  According to Stu Kantor, PBS associate
director of corporate information, &quot;I think people have been
responding to reports in the news about budgetary pressures facing
PBS.&quot;[44]

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

A number of technical analyses confirm, conversely, that
government spending crowds out private philanthropy.  Russell
Roberts, for example, concluded succinctly in the <I>Journal of
Political Economy</I>:  &quot;Current data and evidence from the
Depression yield support for the crowding-out result.  The huge
growth in public transfers in the 1930s crowded out private antipoverty
efforts and fundamentally changed the nature of private charity.
Current data also support this conclusion.&quot;[45] The explanation
rests on a simple truth about human nature:  People tend to defer
responsibility when someone else will answer the bell.  Charles
Murray captures the problem with characteristic genius:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

At the microlevel, the dialogue between the government and the
citizen goes roughly like this:

<p>

Do you want to go out and feed the hungry or are you going to
sit here and watch television?

<p>

I'm tired.  What'll happen if I don't go?

<p>

Well, if you don't go I guess I'll just have to do it myself.

<p>

In that case, you go.[46]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

By rewriting the dialogue between citizen and government,
cuts in government spending alone are likely to trigger increases
in voluntary giving.  At the very least, taxpayers should be allowed
to shift a percentage of their personal income tax payments from
public programs to private charities.  Several legislators have
already proposed a dollar-for-dollar tax credit for contributions
to charities engaged in poverty-fighting efforts (defined by the
income level of the service recipients).  Ideally, taxpayers would
be allowed to divert up to 41 percent of their personal income
tax payments -- that is, the share of total individual income
taxes that currently goes to federal means-tested welfare programs.[47]
For each tax dollar allocated to private sector charity, public
sector charity would be reduced by a dollar.  Thus, with the credit,
private organizations would at last be able to compete on a level
playing field for welfare tax dollars.  And taxpayers would have
the opportunity to indicate their preference: more government
bureaucracy or individuals helping individuals down the street?

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The dollars sent to poverty-fighting organizations would
not undermine giving to museums and symphony orchestras because
money donated to cultural institutions would still be tax deductible.
At present, the tax code permits charitable deductions from taxable
income -- not from the check owed the I.R.S.  Thus, under the
current system, donors in higher tax brackets benefit more from
charitable giving.  Congress should consider elevating the charitable
deduction to 120 percent, but also restoring the deduction to
non-itemizers.

<p>

Approximately seven out of 10 taxpayers opt for the standard
deduction -- even when they have donated a substantial amount
-- usually because they have no mortgage interest deduction.
An above-the-line deduction for charitable contributions for non-itemizing
taxpayers would not only benefit many middle-to-low-income people,
but is also likely to increase charitable giving to an array of
neighborhood organizations involved in poverty prevention efforts.
During 1985-1986, when a charitable deduction for non-itemizers
was last in place, charitable giving among non-itemizers did in
fact rise dramatically.  And tax provisions that empower <I>everyone</I>, 
not just people of means, are precisely the reforms most likely
to benefit the health clinics and mentoring programs in low-and
middle-income neighborhoods.  Surveys show that people who make
the least are inclined to give the highest percentage of their
income to help neighbors in need.[48]

<p>

While block grants simply reallocate power among public bureaucracies,
tax breaks for giving restore power to individual citizens and
communities -- power that in turn will fuel the ethic of caring
that is the true hallmark of freedom.  In <I>Prospects for Conservatives</I>, 
Russell Kirk wrote:  &quot;The enlightened conservative .
. . knows that the just and ordered society is that in which Love
governs us, so far as Love ever can reign in this world of sorrows;
and he knows that the anarchical or the tyrannical society is
that in which Love lies corrupt.&quot;[49]

is correct that men are &quot;put into this world . . . to aspire

end of a system that thrusts our benevolence out to the remotest
periphery, to people whose names and faces we do not know and
whose hands we cannot hold.  Life for them will not be whole again
until we learn to love, one heart at a time.

<h2>THE LAST WORD</h2>

<p><hr width=60% noshade><p>

<h2>My Favorite Volunteer</h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>I</font>n all the years of working with church members, 
my favorite volunteer is a woman in her mid-sixties.  For a long time, 
whenever I would speak with her, she would talk about friends who had 
died and about her arthritis.

<p>

She also talked wistfully about a great disappointment in
her life.  As a girl she had set her goal to become a teacher.
But she came from a poor family, and after the eighth grade she
was required to go out to work to help support her family.  Later
she married, and then she sometimes had to work outside the home
to supplement her husband's earnings and sometimes stayed at home
and cared for her four children.  She never regretted any of this,
but she wondered what might have been.

<p>

I approached this woman one day and said that we needed tutors
for Hispanic and Oriental children.  &quot;Will you tutor?&quot;
I asked.  In effect, I was asking, Will you become the teacher
you always wanted to be?

<p>

&quot;I can't,&quot; she replied.  &quot;I'm too old.&quot;

<p>

&quot;You're not too old,&quot;  I replied.

<p>

&quot;I don't have the skills,&quot; she objected.

<p>

&quot;I'll train you,&quot; I said.

<p>

She finally agreed to go through the training program --
probably to get me off her back.  But she told me she wasn't planning
to tutor; she would just help in other ways.  &quot;Fine,&quot;
I said.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
It is hard to imagine<br>
that anyone anywhere<br>
was happier that night.<br>
She had become the teacher<br>
she had wanted to be.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

At the end of the training, I asked her to tutor two Hispanic
boys. She gave in.

<p>

In subsequent months, when I saw her, I would ask, &quot;How
is your arthritis?&quot;

<p>

&quot;What?&quot; she would say.  Instead, she would tell
me about the boys.

<p>

&quot;Have you been reading the obituaries lately?&quot;
I would ask.

<p>

&quot;No,&quot; she would answer, and then tell me about
the problems the boys were having.  The boys became her life.

<p>

A week before Christmas she was sitting in her living room,
and she heard a terrible commotion outside.  When she opened the
front door, there stood the two boys in the snow.  They had brought
all their classmates to sing Christmas carols to their &quot;favorite
teacher.&quot;

<p>

It is hard to imagine that anyone anywhere was happier that
night.  She had become the teacher she had wanted to be.

<p>

I often think that this woman, who is my mother, is like
many other people:  all reticence and excuses, but when they get
the right opportunity, the training and the encouragement, they
succeed.

<CENTER><H2>A Lesson for Allison</H2>

<P>
	I am not the kind of guy who normally takes part in feminist "consciousness-raising" efforts.  But I am participating in Take Your Daughter to Work Day today because I have an eight-year-old daughter whose self-esteem matters a great deal to me.
<P>
	For the uninitiated, Take Your Daughter To Work Day is an annual event dreamed up by the Ms. Foundation in response to research showing that girls' self-esteem often plummets during the fragile pre-teen and early adolescent years.  By exposing young girls to successful women in the workplace, organizers hope that girls will learn to think more highly of females in general and of themselves in particular.
<P>
	I have a great day planned for my daughter, Allison.  This morning, I plan to take her by the offices of two women whose job it is to meet regularly with members of Congress and other public officials.  Then, I plan to have her talk with a young woman who just finished graduate school at Johns Hopkins University and is now serving as a health policy analyst.  At lunch, she'll chat with a woman who does some public speaking, and another who crunches numbers in our accounting department.  Finally, in the late afternoon, Allison is scheduled to meet with a woman who used to practice law and now manages a bevy of staff writers.
<P>
	I am sure all of this will be interesting to Allison.  But the time I am most looking forward to is the ride home.  For it is then that I plan to point out to my daughter that some of the exciting tasks carried out by my female colleagues in the workplace are tasks my wife performed in jobs she held prior to motherhood.  She used to meet regularly with congressmen and senators.  She used to do some writing and public speaking.  And she has a Phi Beta Kappa key from hr college days.
<P>
	After I remind my daughter of these things, I plan to turn to her and look her in the eye and say, "Allison, you must be a very special young girl.  Your mother could be using her talents and skills in all sorts of jobs in the workplace, but she has chosen instead to use them at home teaching you.  She must love you very, very much and think you are very, very important."
<P>
	Somehow, I think that at that moment my daughter' self-esteem will rise to a level heretofore unimagined by the organizers of Take Your Daughter to Work Day.  And for that I owe debt of gratitude to my wife, whose esteem-building job as a mother at home rarely receives the public esteem it deserves.
<P>

<title> Lobbyists Bring Scare Tactics To Your Hometown -- Heritage </title>

<h2>LOBBYISTS BRING SCARE TACTICS 
TO YOUR HOMETOWN</h2>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/wittmann.htm">Marshall Wittmann</a> and Charles P. Griffin<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
September 21, 1995<br>

<hr width=50%>
</center><p>
	Washington lobbyists may be in your state -- and they are trying to scare you.
<p>	They believe that once you hear what the House of Representatives is up to -- it voted recently to end welfare for lobbyists -- you'll be as scared as they are. 
<p>	If the proposed reform legislation passes, these "beltway bandits" no longer will be able to use government grants -- your hard-earned tax dollars -- to subsidize their political advocacy. Never mind that they didn't ask you whether you agree with their causes or not. They just want your tax dollars. And they won't rest until they are sure they can continue to feed at the public trough.
	<p>Unknown to most Americans, these lobbyists have relied on 40 years of political patronage in Congress to obtain billions of taxpayer dollars that routinely are used to lobby for even more government money. It works like this: A non-profit advocacy group searches through the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance -- a guide to more than $40 billion in annual government giveaways -- to find some program related to its activities. The organization then applies to federal bureaucrats in Washington for a "grant" and receives a fat check from the U.S. Treasury.
<p>	Unfortunately, each federal dollar these advocacy groups receive from Washington frees up other money, which can then be spent on lobbying and other political activities you may or may not agree with. In addition, federal grantees are allowed to "skim" a certain percentage of each grant to apply toward "overhead" or "administrative" expenses. This percentage can range anywhere from 10 to 30 percent or more.  
<p>	A perfect example is the National Council of Senior Citizens (NCSC). Although this organization has actively lobbied Congress against a balanced-budget amendment and other policies, and operates a political action committee that contributes thousands of dollars each year to political candidates, NCSC is 96 percent taxpayer funded. According to its 1993 IRS filing, $72,910,930 of $75,956,825 in revenue came from the government. The bulk of this money came from one of the giveaways in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance called the "Senior Community Service Employment Program." 
<p>	Did the NCSC ever ask you whether you wanted a balanced budget or if you support their slate of political candidates? It didn't ask us either. But it didn't hesitate to take our money -- and yours.
<p>	Of course, your local non-profit couldn't get money from this program. The NCSC is one of only nine national groups allowed to receive the $320 million available from this grant. Why? Because they have the clout and the lobbyists -- bought, in large part, with your money.
<p>	Needless to say, these folks aren't going to take Congress's effort to end such practices lying down. One of their "watchdog" groups, OMB Watch, has been sent out to scare small local non-profits. They want these local groups to call Washington and express concern that the proposed reforms will prevent them from pursuing their activities. In fact, local non-profits that take money from the government usually spend the money wisely -- by directly helping people, not by paying high-priced lobbyists in Washington.
<p>	Believe it or not, OMB Watch is now financing a 27 state "road show" to stir up local non-profits. Given the number of states being visited, the costs are likely to be substantial.
<p>	Who is financing this little circus? After a little digging, we found out that OMB Watch is linked to an organization called the Unison Institute, which receives a taxpayer subsidy. In fact, the two organizations jointly run the "Right-to-Know" computer network (RTK Net) on the Internet, which is being used as a primary tool for the campaign to protect welfare for lobbyists. The credits on RTK Net proudly proclaim that it is paid for by "multiple philanthropic and government agencies," including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
<p>	In other words, the same shell game these groups use to obtain your tax dollars for lobbying is being used to preserve the shell game itself!
<p>	So, when the "road show" arrives in your town, and you hear horror stories about babies crying and old folks dying because of what the new meanies in Congress want to do to non-profit organizations that lobby, don't be fooled. 
<p>	Just ask if the people making the claims receive any government funding. Then ask why they didn't check with you before they used your money to lobby for their cause.

<title>PRO-FAMILY TAX RELIEF</title>

<body>

<center>

<img src="/townhall/FRC/fampol/fampolgn.gif">

<h1>Pro-Family Tax Relief</h1>
<h2><i>A Look at Per-Child Credits ... and the Flat Tax</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>N</font>ine years ago, President Reagan's White House 
Working Group on the Family issued a report entitled, <I>The Family: 
Preserving America's Future</I>, which had as its central recommendation
a dramatic expansion in per-child tax benefits.[1] Five years later,
the bipartisan National Commission on Children (on which then-Governor
Bill Clinton served) issued a report entitled <I>Beyond Rhetoric:
A New American Agenda for Children and Families</I>, which also
had as its central recommendation a dramatic increase in per-child
tax benefits.[2]

<p>

Given that leading officials from both parties have been talking
about pro-family tax relief for nearly a decade, the current debate
over per-child tax benefits should center around this question:
does the House GOP's proposed $500 children's tax credit offer
adequate relief to America's families or should Congress instead
move in the direction of the National Commission on Children's
call for a $1,000 per-child tax credit.

<p>

Sadly, that is not the debate taking place in Washington today.
In recent months, a noisy chorus of critics and naysayers have
been raising all sorts of objections to pro-family tax relief.
Their criticisms - which are at times contradictory - advance
a number of myths.

<p>

<center><h3>The Pander Bear Myth</h3></center>

<p>

Some argue that pro-family tax relief is an extravagant political
giveaway at odds with the larger public interest.  This idea is
advanced frequently by members of the media, who realize just
how popular pro-family tax relief is.  Rather than thoughtfully
considering the merits of various tax-cutting proposals, these
reporters and pundits smugly sneer at public officials, accusing
them of &quot;pandering&quot; to middle Americans.

<p>

One does not often find himself in the position of defending
politicians, but this sort of activity must be recognized for
what it is -- an attempt by members of the liberal media elite
to make Members of Congress feel guilty about doing what the people
elected them to do.  It is the flipside to the liberal media's
reaction to politicians who advance unpopular tax increases, who
are routinely hailed as &quot;profiles in courage.&quot;

<p>

Voters see nothing courageous about broken campaign promises.
Indeed, few things have contributed more to voter cynicism than
President Bush's failure to keep his &quot;no new taxes&quot;
pledge and President Clinton's decision to abandon his promised
&quot;middle-income tax cut&quot; soon after the 1992 election.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
It is important that policy-makers<br>
view this as a debate over 'pro-family<br>
tax cuts,' not simply 'middle-income<br>
tax relief.'
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The American people strongly support pro-family tax relief.
They want to keep more of the money they earn.  They sense that
the well-being of their families -- and the well-being of the nation
-- would improve if they had greater control over their lives.

<p>

On this point, they are right. To acknowledge as much is not
pandering.

<p>

<center><h3>The Bigger Deficit Myth</h3></center>

<p>

Some say pro-family tax relief will increase the deficit and
cause interest rates to rise.  It is quite true that the deficit
would rise if a pro-family tax cut were adopted <I>by itself</I>.
It is also quite true that an increase in government borrowing
would contract the supply of funds available for private lending,
thereby putting upward pressure on interest rates.

<p>

But it is important to point out that no one is talking about
adopting a pro-family tax cut <I>by itself</I>.  All of the sponsors
of major legislation have pledged to offset pro-family tax cuts
with dollar-for-dollar reductions in government spending.

<p>

Pro-family tax cuts &quot;paid for&quot;  by spending cuts cancel
each other out on the balance sheet.  They should have no effect
on the deficit or on interest rates.

<p>

<center><h3>The No-Growth Myth</h3></center>

<p>

Another argument often raised is that pro-family tax relief won't
spur economic growth.  This concern comes from those who believe
that tax policy should serve only economic ends, that it should
steer clear of social considerations and focus exclusively on
promoting economic growth.

<p>

There are two problems with this viewpoint.  First, much of what
is called  &quot;economic growth&quot; isn't growth at all.[3]
It is a movement of economic activity from the non-market home
economy to the quantifiable market economy.  For example, when
a family that once cared for its own child enrolls the child in
a paid day care program, there is no increase in the amount of
economic activity.  There is simply a shift from the non-market
economy to the market economy.  Yet this shift is counted as 
&quot;positive&quot; economic growth even though it often has a 
&quot;negative&quot; effect on the child's well-being.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
True economic growth involves an<br>
increase in productivity, not simply<br>
in market activity. Until our nation's<br>
economic debate is built around this<br>
fact, much of what is advanced in the<br>
name of 'growth' ought not to be adopted.
</i></b></font>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

True economic growth involves an increase in <I>productivity</I>,
not simply in market activity.  Until our nation's economic debate
is built around this fact, much of what is advanced in the name
of &quot;growth&quot; ought not to be adopted.

<p>

The second problem with the &quot;pro-family tax cuts don't spur
growth&quot; myth is that it pretends that economic policy can
be separated from social policy, that the size of a family's tax
burden simply affects its economic well-being and decision-making.
The truth, of course, is that tax policy not only affects people's
economic decision-making (about working, saving, spending, investing,
etc.) but also their &quot;non-economic&quot; decision-making
(about marrying, childbearing, childrearing, etc.).

<p>

While it is true that economic policy should strive to exert
as little influence as possible over &quot;non-economic&quot;
decisions (so that, for example, people who otherwise would not
marry won't get married just for the tax breaks), it is also true
that our nation's current economic policies exert considerable
influence over &quot;non-economic&quot; decision-making and that
this influence is almost always in an <I>anti-family</I> direction.

<p>

For example, Allan Carlson of the Rockford Institute has shown
that the Social Security system has a pernicious anti-child bias
because it robs parents of the social insurance value of their
children, thereby creating a disincentive for young couples to
invest in childrearing.[4] Indeed, if Congress were to seek to
offset this bias via the tax code (which is the only apparent
option given Social Security's sacrosanct status), it would have
to raise actual per-child savings to roughly $2,100 per child.[5]
When one considers that the net value of the current child tax
exemption is less than $400 per child (for the average family)
and that the high-water mark in the current debate is an additional
$500 per-child tax credit, it is easy to see why many people are
disappointed that the proposals currently being considered aren't
even bolder -- or to use the media's phrase, more courageous.

<p>

Of course, some are reluctant to adopt even a $500 credit because
they are intimidated by the economic &quot;cost&quot; in lost
revenue to the government.  While anti-family policies that took
more than 50 years to develop cannot be wiped out in 50 (or even
100) days, it is important to recognize that there is a social
&quot;cost&quot; to inaction or compromise.  The social &quot;cost&quot;
of weak families is measured in things like divorce rates and
crime statistics.  And these social problems impose enormous economic
costs on our society and our government.  Indeed, the best way
to reduce the demand for government services is to free families
to care for themselves.  Conversely, the best way to hinder the
dismantling of the welfare state is to leave the tax burden on
families with children at or near their current levels so that
families have a difficult time taking back responsibilities from
the state.

<center><h3>The Middle-Class Only Myth</h3></center>

<p>

Should pro-family tax relief go only to middle-class taxpayers?
Some say so.

<p>

This concern makes the mistake of viewing tax issues through
the prism of class rather than through the prism of family.  It
is true that middle-class Americans often get short shrift in
current tax policy.  (For example, when combined employer-employee
payroll taxes are added to income taxes, some lower-middle-income
couples actually have a marginal tax rate comparable to 
upper-middle-income individuals in the 28 percent bracket.)

<p>

But it is even more true that families with children are shortchanged
in current tax policy.  For example, during the first four decades
after the end of WWII, the income tax burden on singles and childless
couples increased only slightly, while it increased more than
200 percent for families with two children.[6] Reagan-era reforms
helped to reverse this trend moderately, but the dramatic shift
in tax burden from non-parents to parents still dwarfs any shift
in tax burden along income lines.

<p>

Thus, it is important that policymakers view this as a debate
over &quot;pro-family tax cuts,&quot; not simply &quot;middle-income
tax relief.&quot;  This is the way both the 1986 Working Group
and the 1991 National Commission on Children saw the issue.  Indeed,
neither of these reports advocated any type of means-testing on
per-child benefits.  Both recognized that the principle being
advanced was tax relief for families of all incomes to use in
raising children, not tax relief to people who happen to fall
into an income category that everyone considers middle-class (a
category that invariably shrinks as public debate progresses).

<p>

The fact that tax relief should be first and foremost pro-family
does not mean that policymakers should be unconcerned about the
distributional impact of these cuts.  To its credit, the House
GOP plan extends relief in the form of a per-child credit rather
than an increased per-child exemption.  In actual dollar terms,
a credit provides equal relief to all taxpayers; but in 
percentage-of-tax-burden terms, it offers greater relief to working-class 
and middle-income taxpayers than to wealthier taxpayers. (Tax exemptions, 
conversely, skew savings up the income scale, offering greater per-child 
savings to those in higher brackets.)

<p>

This is not to say that tax exemptions are always inferior to
tax credits; for example, one of the virtues of the current exemption
is that its value rises if tax rates rise, thereby guaranteeing
continued horizontal tax equity between parents and non-parents
at any income level.

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Still, given the tax code's current problems, a non-means-tested
tax credit is the best mechanism for helping families with children.
Indeed, if Congress wanted to maximize its distributional bang
for buck, it might want to consider a non-refundable version of
the 1991 National Commission on Children's $1,000 credit (which
replaced the existing exemption, thereby offering $600+ in net
per-child relief to those in the 15 percent tax bracket, but less
than $300 in net per-child tax relief to those in higher tax brackets).
Moving in this direction would make it easier for Congress to
lift the existing (and newly-proposed) income caps on per-child
benefits -- a problem that definitely needs addressing since income
caps at any level produce marriage penalties.

<p>

Speaking of marriage penalties, the income caps on the Earned
Income Tax Credit have created such a serious anti-marriage effect
that Congress should use all of the monies set aside in the marriage
penalty section of the American Dream Restoration Act to address
the marriage bias facing families earning below the median income.
The Talent-Faircloth welfare reform initiative from 1994 called
for a $1,000 pro-marriage tax credit.  This would be a constructive,
problem-solving first step.  It ought to be adopted.

<p>

<center><h3>The Can't Trust Parents Myth</h3></center>

<p>

Some believe pro-family tax relief should tie benefits to family
expenses (like education) that the government should promote.
This concern springs from the notion that the government knows
more about what families should spend their money for than parents
do.

<p>

Not only is this a false premise, but it leads to all sorts of
unproductive economic distortions.  Indeed, one of the chief reasons
college tuition costs have been rising at a pace exceeding the
general inflation rate is that many students have been given grants
and loans that could be used only for educational purposes.  Knowing
this to be the case, college administrators have raised the cost
of higher education beyond what it would be if students' economic
resources were completely fungible and available for multiple
uses.

<p>

While no one wants to discourage bright young people from pursuing
a higher education, the sad truth is that tax cuts earmarked for
this or any other family expense will have the effect of increasing
the cost of that good or service, thereby exacerbating current
problems and putting a college education out of the reach of some
interested students.  In addition, tax deductions keyed to college
tuition expenses benefit students attending higher-priced schools
more than other students.

<p>

While it would be counter-productive for Congress to provide
tax cuts for specific expenses, it would be helpful for Congress
to modify existing Individual Retirement Account (IRA) rules to
permit taxpayers to enjoy tax-favored savings for a wider variety
of purposes (college tuition, first-time home-buying, etc.). 
In the first case, Congress would be limiting families' economic
freedom, in the second, it would be expanding it.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Few things have contributed more to<br>
voter cynicism than President Bush's<br>
failure to keep his no new taxes pledge<br>
and President Clinton's decision to<br>
abandon his promised middle-income tax<br>
cut soon after the 1992 election.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

This is not to say, however, that the Super IRA included in the
House GOP Contract should be adopted in its current form.  The
&quot;back-loaded&quot; nature of its design obligates future
generations to an economic promise made today.  Given the size
of the federal debt, and the pernicious anti-family influence
of intergenerational entitlement programs, Congress should steer
clear of repeating past mistakes.  If tax-favored savings are
to be expanded, they should be expanded within the context of
a &quot;front-loaded&quot; savings mechanism.

<p>

<center><h3>Armey's Flat Tax Appeal</h3></center>

<p>

While the proposed increase in per-child tax benefits is commanding
center stage in the current debate, there is growing interest
in a flat tax proposal sponsored by House GOP Minority Leader
Dick Armey.  The Armey proposal, which some Republicans want to
make a central plank in the 1996 GOP campaign platform, would
reduce the federal income tax form to the size of a post card
by eliminating all existing deductions, exemptions, and credits.
Thus, after claiming &quot;personal allowances&quot; (which allow
taxpayers to adjust their tax liability for family size), all
taxpayers would pay income taxes at a 17 percent marginal rate.

<p>

As such, the Armey plan has a number of appealing features.
These include:

<ul><p>

<li><b><i>Simplicity</i></b>.  Despite periodic attempts to make
tax filing easier, America's tax code is
littered with so many cumbersome rules, regulations, and stipulations
that many ordinary taxpayers feel justifiably overwhelmed.  Eliminating
the tax code's complexity would reduce errors and encourage respect
for and compliance with the code.  It would also free people to
make more productive use of the time they now devote to income
tax compliance.  According to economist Walter Williams of George
Mason University, Americans spend more than six billion hours
each year on record keeping, tax planning, and tax return preparation.
If those same hours were spent producing useful things, Williams
says they would be equal to the combined output of our auto, truck,
and aircraft industries.[7]

<p>

<li><b><i>No Withholding</i></b>.  Rather than continuing the
current system of having employers
withhold income taxes from employees' wages, the Armey plan would
permit taxpayers to take home their entire gross earnings and
then make a monthly tax payment to the government (much as they
currently make a monthly mortgage payment to their lending company).
Eliminating wage withholding would free employers from burdensome
administrative paperwork -- and would help taxpayers see just how
large their tax bite is.  Nothing fosters high taxes more than
the fact that they are currently &quot;hidden&quot; from full
view by wage withholding.  Were all earnings to &quot;pass through&quot;
taxpayers' wallets, Americans would undoubtedly become more aware
of their current tax burden -- and of any changes to it in the
future.

<p>

<li><b><i>Reduced Marriage Penalty</i></b>.  The Armey plan eliminates
most existing marriage penalties in the current income tax code by 
offering marrieds a personal allowance twice that of singles and by 
eliminating all tax rate progressivity. (By retaining the &quot;head of 
household&quot; filing category for single parents, the marriage penalty 
is not eliminated altogether.)  Given the size of the current penalty
(particularly among the working poor) and the larger cultural
need to strengthen the institution of marriage, the Armey plan's
improved treatment of marriage compares well to current law.

<p>

<li><b><i>No Junk</i></b>.  While there is a case to be made for
tax simplification for simplification's
sake, the Armey plan's eradication of existing deductions and
credits has the added virtue of eliminating many ill-conceived
tax write-offs.  For example, the deductibility of state and local
taxes has the effect of redistributing income from people living
in low-tax areas to people living in high-tax states.  Similarly,
the dependant care tax credit has the effect of redistributing
income from families that care for their own children to families
that enroll their children in day care.  Eliminating such write-offs
would eliminate economic distortions and perverse social incentives.

<p>

<li><b><i>Generous Family Benefits</i></b>.  The Armey plan proposes
personal allowances of $13,100
for singles, $26,200 for marrieds, and $5,300 for each dependent
child.  As such, a typical family of four would not begin paying
income taxes until it has earned $36,800 in income.  Although
these family benefits are less generous than those which existed
in the late 1940s and early 1950s, they are considerably higher
than current thresholds (which shield a family of four's first
$16,150 from income taxation).

</ul><p>

<center><h3>Challenges for The Armey Approach</h3></center>

<p>

While the Armey plan has many appealing features, it also faces
a number of challenges -- challenges that will need to be addressed
before the Armey plan (or any variation of it) can be adopted.
These include:

<p><ul>

<li><b><i>Doesn't The Federal Government Already Have An Effective
Flat Tax?</i></b> Most &quot;flat
tax&quot; proponents think only in terms of leveling federal
income taxes.  But America's taxpayers not only pay federal income
taxes but also federal payroll taxes.  The combined employer-employee
share of payroll taxes is just over 15 percent for taxpayers earning
up to $60,600.  This means that most working-class and middle-income
families have a combined marginal tax rate of roughly 30 percent
(divided almost equally between payroll and income taxes).  This
amount is comparable to the marginal tax rate of upper-middle-income
taxpayers in the 28 and 31 percent income tax brackets.

<p>

If Congress were to adopt the Armey plan, and to leave in place
the existing payroll tax, taxpayers in the current 15 percent
income tax bracket would see their combined marginal tax rate
rise to over 32 percent (because Armey replaces the 15 percent
rate with a 17 percent rate).  Meanwhile, upper-middle-income
taxpayers (whose incomes exceed the current cap on payroll taxes)
would experience a dramatic reduction in marginal tax rates from
28 and 31 percent to 17 percent.

</ul>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Nothing fosters high taxes more<br>
than the fact that they are<br>
currently hidden from full<br>
view by wage witholding.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<ul>

Armey proponents choose not to address the payroll tax question,
arguing that social security &quot;contributions&quot; should
be viewed as mandatory payments to a pension plan rather than
taxes to support a cash transfer program.  Given that taxpayers
have no control of these &quot;mandatory payments,&quot; Congress
should alter the construct of the Armey plan so that it takes
payroll taxes into consideration.  This would ensure that taxpayers
earning below $60,600 would not have higher marginal tax rates
than those making above $60,600.

<p>

<li><b><i>Doesn't Rate Progressivity Offset The Anti-Family Aspects
Of The Social Security System?</i></b> Allan Carlson of the Rockford 
Institute argues that &quot;the effect of a flat income tax rate at levels
above 10 percent is to weaken the family as an economic unit.&quot;[8]
Carlson believes a progressive income tax is preferable because
rate progressivity encourages non-market home production over
market production.  Given that the long-term health of our society
(and, for that matter, the long-term health of our economy) would
be threatened by the shift of certain responsibilities from families
and volunteer associations to the market economy, Carlson believes
taxwriters should attempt to make the tax code more progressive
rather than less.  (He would take the revenues generated by greater
progressivity and devote them to a $1,500 per-child credit and
a revival of income-splitting to solve the marriage penalty problem.)

<p>

While Carlson's call for greater progressivity is unlikely to
find an audience with most GOP policymakers, it is important to
point out that the case for a flat tax is seriously weakened by
the social security system's anti-child bias.  If there were no
social security system, parents would have a natural economic
incentive to invest in childrearing because their economic security
in old age would be directly linked to their children's future
productivity.  In other words, in a world without social security,
the workaholic who neglects his childrearing responsibilities
puts himself at risk in old age because his children may turn
out to be dolts or sloths incapable of offering him support if
needed.

</ul>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<ul>

In a world with social security, however, the workaholic who
neglects his childrearing responsibilities puts himself at no
such risk.  If his kids turn out to be unproductive, he does not
suffer -- so long as there are plenty of well-reared children from
other families capable of keeping the system afloat.

<p>

Thankfully, economic incentives are not the only factors -- or
even the primary factors -- influencing parental investments in
children.  Moral imperatives still carry much sway.

<p>

But lest anyone think economic factors are irrelevant, consider
how often one hears talk today from families that say they &quot;can't
afford another child&quot; or &quot;can't afford to have one parent
stay home with young children because they have to have two paychecks.&quot;

<p>

In the abstract, one can easily make a case that an ideal economic
system would have neither a progressive income tax nor an old-age
social insurance scheme.

<p>

Given that no modification in social security is being proposed,
proponents of the Armey flat tax must explain how they would propose
to counteract policy-based incentives for parents to neglect their
non-market childrearing duties.

<p>

<li><b><i>How Does Eliminating Charitable Contributions Square
With A Larger Social Vision That Wants To Replace Government Welfare 
With Private Charity?</i></b> 
To their credit, most proponents of the Armey flat tax are also
advocates of limited government who would like to see the welfare
state dismantled and replaced by private charity.  While this
philosophy does not obligate one to support the continuation
of tax write-offs for charitable contributions, it may be asking
too much to expect the American people simultaneously to support
an elimination of charitable tax deductions and a dismantling
of government welfare programs.  Given the serious social problems
associated with government welfare programs, Congress should do
nothing that might have the effect of undermining public support
for dismantling the welfare state.  Not only does this argue for
the retention of charitable contributions, it actually argues
for an expansion of them.

<p>

Here again, the question is not necessarily one of what is best
in the abstract.  The question, instead, is whether the goal of
a deduction-free tax code should supersede all other goals -- including
the goal of shifting welfare responsibilities from the state to
the charitable sector.

<p>

<li><b><i>How Will Eliminating The Deductibility Of Mortgage Interest
Affect Property Values And The Real Net Worth Of Families?</i></b> Just 
as charitable contributions present a dilemma to Armey flat tax 
proponents, so too do home mortgage interest payments.

<p>

While the intellectual case for mortgage interest deductions
is far weaker than for charitable contributions -- in fact, Carlson
argues that mortgage interest deductions have had an anti-family
effect by encouraging smaller households and spurring artificial
growth in housing prices[9] -- the problem is that eliminating the
mortgage interest deduction that is now in place could have an
even more serious anti-family effect.  Many families have a considerable
share of their entire net worth tied up in their homes.  If a
proposal eliminating the mortgage interest deduction were to pass,
and thereby to pull the rug out from under property owners, the
social and economic effects could be quite serious.  Indeed, the
recession that occurred during the Bush Administration was caused
in part by a decline in home values.  As families saw their net
worth falling, they understandably felt less freedom to make new
purchases.

<p>

It is possible, as Armey proponents maintain, that the negative
effect on property values of eliminating home mortgage deductibility
will be offset by the positive effect of greater economic growth
in other parts of the economy.  But it is also quite possible
that consumers will respond to the elimination of home mortgage
deductibility in the same manner they responded to the housing
recession of the late 1980s.

<p>

Given that those who have the most to lose from instability in
the housing market are young families who have recently purchased
first homes, Congress must proceed very cautiously in this area.

<p>

<li><b><i>Won't The Value Of Pro-Family Benefits Decline As The
Legislative Process Unfolds?</i></b> As noted earlier, the Armey tax 
plan includes
adjustments for family size that exceed current law.  While this
is one of the plan's most laudable features, there is reason to
believe that the benefit levels leaving the starting gate of the
legislative process would never survive the marathon to the finish
line.  The reason is simple:  if any change is made in the Armey
plan that would have the effect of reducing revenues (such as
reinserting certain tax write-offs) the only options Armey would
have would be:

<p><ul>

(1)  to increase the deficit;<br>
(2)  to raise the tax rate above 17 percent; or<br>
(3)  to reduce family benefits.

</ul><p>

The first option would be unlikely in any scenario, but is especially
so given that Armey's proposal, by his own estimates, would raise
$40 billion less than current law (and some claim the shortfall
would be as much as four times this amount).  Indeed, given the
level of concern that has already arisen about revenue shortfalls,
it is quite possible that family tax benefits could be raided
even if no other changes were made to the Armey plan.

<p>

The second option -- raising the tax rate above 17 percent -- is
also unlikely because the political support for the flat tax largely
hangs or falls on the size of this number.  Tax policy is mysterious
to most Americans.  Average citizens are far more likely to follow
fluctuations in the flat rate structure than fluctuations in the
family benefits -- especially since the premise of the debate is
that we need a flat <I>rate</I>.

</ul>

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<ul>

Thus, those who believe the most serious problem in the current
tax code is the absence of significant pro-family benefits are
poorly served by a debate that emphasizes rates rather than the
size of pro-family benefits.

<p>

Indeed, one of the virtues of the existing debate surrounding
the House GOP's Contract proposal is that it has centered around
the $500 per-child figure.  While this amount should be higher,
it will be difficult for Members of Congress to pass something
less than this amount without having to do an awful lot of explaining
to their constituents. Hopefully, Armey proponents can find
a way to offer this level of protection to pro-family benefits
during the legislative process.

</ul><p>

<center><h3>Family First</h3></center>

<p>

After years of talk but no action on the pro-family tax front,
Congress appears poised to finally adopt some significant per-child
relief.  This is long overdue.  In 1948, a median income family
of four sent two percent of its annual income to the federal government
in federal income and payroll taxes.  Today, that same family
sends 24.5 percent of its income to the Federal Treasury.[10] The
erosion in the value of per-child benefits is the primary reason
for this dramatic increase in the income tax burden of America's
families.  According to Eugene Steuerle of the Urban Institute,
the current child exemption would need to be quadrupled in size
in order to offset the same percentage of income that the exemption
shielded from taxation in 1948.[11]

<p>

Given the magnitude of this historic shift, nothing -- including
the possibility of making even more dramatic tax changes in the
near future -- should deter Congress from adopting at least $500
in per-child tax savings.

<h2>A CLOSER LOOK</h2>

<p><hr width=60% noshade><p>

<h2>The Limits of Tax Relief</h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>W</font>hile it is important for Members of Congress to 
recognize the virtues of pro-family tax relief, it is also important 
for them to recognize the limitations of pro-family relief.

<p>

Pro-family tax relief will not make husbands love their wives
or children respect their parents.  It will not clear up filthy
TV or remove child predators from our streets.  In short, pro-family
tax relief, by itself, will not magically solve the myriad social
problems facing America's families, neighborhoods, and communities.

<p>

But pro-family tax relief will make it easier for families to
thrive by reducing economic stress.  It will make it easier for
parent
them from other harms by freeing them to spend more of their time
with their children and less of their time frantically chasing
the almighty, overtaxed dollar.

<p>

In short, pro-family tax relief will empower parents to address
many family needs that only they can meet.

<p>

America needs parents who want to raise their children well.
But we also need policies that empower them to act upon these
sentiments.

<p>

The 104th Congress should adopt nothing less than $500 in per-child
tax relief for all taxpaying families.

<h1>With Liberty and Justice for All</h1>
<h2><i>Redefining the Educational Choice Debate</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>E</font>ducation is a so-called mixed good. It offers both 
public and private benefits. Thus, the debate over education policy in 
America is often cast as a clash between public and private interests,
a conflict between equity and liberty. In the words of social
scientist James Coleman:

<p><blockquote>

<i>[C]ontradictions . . . arise out of two simultaneously-held values
that are very relevant to most Americans. The first is the autonomy
and choice of parents to do all they can to raise their children
to adulthood. The second is the value we place on having a society
that is not fragmented by divisions imposed by segregated or exclusive
upbringing.</i>[1]

</blockquote><p>

Liberty and equity are not mutually-exclusive concepts. But if
their proper relationship is to be achieved, policymakers must
develop a new understanding of equal opportunity based on liberty.
Education policy in America today often fails to pay respect to
the need for parents to direct their children's upbringing. Indeed,
calls for parental choice in education typically run headlong
into the myth of the &quot;common school&quot; and the rhetoric
of &quot;equal opportunity&quot; -- outmoded ideas which the education
establishment successfully employs to protect its vested interest.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<font size=+1><b><i>
Paine believed that most poor<br>
parents were well aware of the<br>
benefits of education and that<br>
heavy taxation was the chief<br>
cause of their under-investment<br>
in education.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Thus, a gradual &quot;demythologizing&quot; of the common school
as the bulwark of democracy and the ultimate expression of equal
opportunity will be necessary to sustain any hope of expanding
private liberty (and improving student performance) through parental
choice in education. Otherwise, the political power of the teacher
unions and the philosophical tensions inherent in education will
continue to render choice an elusive goal.

<p>

<center><h3>No Paine, No Gain</h3></center>

<p>

Political theorists have long debated whether government should
be involved in education in any capacity. More than two centuries
ago, Thomas Jefferson made an eloquent case for a state role in
education in a letter to George Wythe:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Preach, my dear Sir, a crusade against ignorance, establish and
improve the law for educating the common people. Let our countrymen
know that the people alone can protect us against these evils,
and that the tax which will be paid for this purpose is not more
than the thousandth part of what will be paid to kings, priests
and nobles who will rise up among us if we leave the people in
ignorance.</i>[2]

</blockquote><p>

Interestingly, many of the classical economists who were busy
ardently defending laissez-faire economic policies in Jefferson's
day were also forceful advocates of a state role in education.
Adam Smith argued in <I>The Wealth of Nations</I> that the market
would fail to capture the social benefits of education because
of the divergence between public and private interests.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Mill's sympathy for government<br>
paternalism did not extend to<br>
justifying inefficient and<br>
inferior education in the name<br>
of broad public purposes.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

But Smith stopped short of issuing an unqualified endorsement
of state-sponsored education. Contrasting the quality of education
under public and private arrangement, Smith argued that private
schools were more successful in cultivating skills in reading,
writing and arithmetic.[3] While eager to promote the education of
all students, Smith did not share the conviction of Jeremy Bentham
and other utilitarians that government could successfully administer
education. Instead, he argued for a wide dispersal of educational
expenditure and decision-making to prevent teacher compensation
from being made independent of effort.

<p>

Similarly, Thomas Paine believed that most poor parents were well
aware of the benefits of education and that heavy taxation was
the chief cause of their underinvestment in education. Paine proposed
a much more far-reaching decentralization of authority that would
further increase parental freedom of choice and competition among
schools. In <I>The Rights of Man</I>, he proposed &quot;to make
a remission of taxes to every poor family out of the surplus taxes
. . . enjoining the parents of such children to send them to 
school.&quot;[4]

<p>

John Stuart Mill's writings on the question of state education
are ambiguous and at times self-contradictory because he, too,
was acutely aware of the tension between personal liberty and
the public purposes of education. On the one hand, Mill differed
from Paine. Mill believed that government must control education
because parents were incompetent to judge their children's best
interests. But in a moment of supreme doubt, he wrote: &quot;A
general State education is a mere contrivance for moulding [sic]
people to be exactly like one another. . . it establishes a despotism
over the mind.&quot;[5] Mill's enthusiasm for state schools, moreover,
depended on the assumption that the public schools would always
be superior to private institutions. He wrote in <I>On Liberty</I>
that a state school should exist, &quot;if it exist at all, as
one among many competing experiments, carried on for the purpose
of example and stimulus, to keep the others up to a certain standard
of excellence.&quot;[6] Mill's sympathy for government paternalism
did not extend to justifying inefficient and inferior education
in the name of broad public purposes.

<p>

In the earliest years of the Republic, parental fees provided
the majority of funding for schools, as Adam Smith and Thomas
Paine had recommended. As parents exercised their freedom to determine
the shape of their children's education, the great heterogeneity
of the nation expressed itself in the diversity and autonomy of
its local schools.

<p>

Nineteenth century reformers, however, launched a campaign to
redefine education as the means to restore morality, justice and
social conformity. A public-purpose rationale began to triumph
over respect for the private benefits afforded parents by the
freedom and genuine diversity in the schools. Under Horace Mann's
leadership, reformers succeeded in creating a system that was
&quot;bureaucratic and professional, designed to ensure, so the
story goes, that education would be taken out of politics and
placed in the hands of impartial experts devoted to the public
interest.&quot; It was the &quot;one best system,&quot; also referred
to as the &quot;common school.&quot;[7]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Over the last three decades,<br>
it has become increasingly<br>
evident that the public school<br>
is failing to fulfill its high-<br>
minded egalitarian purpose.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Egalitarian democracy was now operationally-defined as centrally-planned
uniformity, secured through bureaucratic arrangements. According
to education historian E.G. West, however, it was teachers and
government officials, not discontented parents, who brought about
the change.[8] And, as economist Milton Friedman has observed, it
was hardly an apolitical enterprise: &quot;Though the arguments
were all pitched in terms of the public interest, much of the
support of teachers and administrators for the public school movement
derived from a narrow self-interest,&quot; including greater control
over the schools and almost guaranteed salaries now that government
was the paymaster.[9] Friedman notes that reformers simply capitalized
on public sympathy for the concept of equal opportunity to succeed
in establishing universal, &quot;free&quot; and compulsory education.[10]
That same egalitarian impulse had already found private expression
in the form of charity schools and the adjustment of school fees
according to means, as West and other historians report.[11]

<p>

<center><h3>From Equity to Liberty</h3></center>

<p>

Over the last three decades, it has become increasingly evident
that the public school is failing to fulfill its high-minded egalitarian
purpose. Equity &quot;based on homogeneity has occurred only by
discriminating against some, segregating others, and denying the
possibilities of alternative ways of life.&quot;[12] Historian David
Cohen explains:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Education has long been seen as both the chief antidote to
poverty and the principal means for assimilating ethnic and racial
minorities. . . . Since [the late 1960s], however, events have
cast serious doubt on these two venerable articles of faith .
. . that education is the high road to equality or social 
integration.</i>[13]

</blockquote><p>

In 1966, Coleman released his now-famous Equality of Educational
Opportunity report, concluding that differences in the quality
of the nation's schools bear only a trivial relationship to differences
in the educational achievement of the nation's students. Coleman's
report posed a fundamental question: If schools have little effect
on differences in children's achievement, is state-controlled
public education the key to social justice?

<p>

At about the same time, empirical evidence of low academic performance
in the public schools caused Friedman to start repopularizing
criticisms of the &quot;common school&quot; first made by Smith,
Paine, and Mill. As an alternative, Friedman began calling for
educational vouchers that would give parents freedom of choice,
thereby increasing competitive supply. Given the ineffectiveness
of the present education system, he asked rhetorically, &quot;Wherein
are the 'neighborhood effects' that justify such use of tax 
money?&quot;[14]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<font size=+1><b><i>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

To broaden the base of potential support for vouchers, Friedman
took pains to argue that his proposal would actually enhance equality
of opportunity. Under the current system, he noted, wealthy families
have significantly more freedom of choice than low-income families.
Poor families are trapped in poor school districts. They lack
the resources to move or to choose private schools. &quot;Under
present arrangements, stratification of residential areas effectively
restricts the intermingling of children from decidedly different
backgrounds. . . . Our present system, far from equalizing opportunity,
very likely does the opposite.&quot;[15]

<p>

While Friedman questioned the practical interpretation of the
public purposes of education, he appealed primarily to a philosophical
commitment to individual liberty. &quot;Persuasive as [the] argument
[for achieving a common core of values] is, . . . [o]n grounds
of principle, it conflicts with the preservation of freedom itself,&quot;
he wrote.[16] Friedman suggested that the circumstances that justified
the definition of education as a predominantly public good in
the Progressive Era were eclipsed by circumstances that now favor
the definition of education as a private good.

<p>

While vouchers appealed to Friedman as a means to introduce the
efficiency of the market into education, liberal social analyst
Christopher Jencks embraced vouchers as a means to equalize opportunity
by improving the education of low-income and minority children.
Favoring egalitarian over libertarian goals, he designed a voucher
experiment for the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO) in the
1960s that included heavy regulatory burdens governing admissions
policies, fiscal incentives for schools to accept poor students,
and the creation of an educational voucher agency to oversee the
program. The OEO voucher experiment demonstrated the problems
of policy design and political opposition that would hamper implementation
of educational choice even after changing philosophical definitions
had begun to broaden its appeal.

<p>

In most of the prospective test sites, local educators and grass-roots
organizations blocked Jencks' proposal. &quot;In effect, there
was no constituency for a plan that threatened the job security
of teachers [and] compromised the independence of private schools.&quot;[17]
Finally, the Alum Rock school district in California agreed to
the voucher demonstration; but, &quot;the process of negotiation
between federal sponsors and local interest groups resulted in
a dramatic alteration of the voucher plan. Ultimately, no private
schools participated . . . [and] [n]o teachers in unpopular programs
lost their jobs. In fact, none of the incentives usually thought
to spur initiative in the private sector were present in Alum
Rock.&quot;[18] Interestingly, Jencks and his associates concluded
that, &quot;if restrictions are too rigid, a voucher system is
likely to be indistinguishable from the present public school
system.&quot;[19] Conservatives argued that the regulations Jencks
himself proposed to satisfy equity requirements emasculated the
voucher concept, precluding an adequate test of educational choice.

<p>

The unregulated character of Friedman's proposals, however, still
posed too great a risk to liberal policymakers to win passage.
Writing at the time, education analyst Dennis Doyle observed:

<p><blockquote>

<i>The basic reason that policymakers will not support either
Jencks or Friedman vouchers is that the dimension of vouchers
that makes them interesting -- choice -- still threatens an egalitarian
society. At the present time only one important interest group
might change this, and that group is minorities in general, especially
[black Americans]. . . . [T]here is a growing body of minority
and black opinion which holds that choice itself is the key to
equality -- and that without choice, equal educational opportunity
will remain unfulfilled.</i>[20]

</blockquote><p>

Alum Rock proved to be an early sign of increasing national interest
in the concept of educational choice -- coupled with persistently
dubious prospects for political passage of any far-reaching voucher
proposal.

<p>

<center><h3>Toward a Philosophical Redefinition</h3></center>

<p>

As the limitations of the common school have grown increasingly
obvious and the case for educational choice more plausible, choice
opponents have clung more desperately to the &quot;myth of the
common school&quot; as a pluralist and apolitical institution.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

From the outset, a primary objective of the common school was
the socialization of all children in an overtly religious, yet
non-sectarian environment. Educator Charles Glenn's book <I>The
Myth of the Common School</I> portrays the movement toward state
education as a mission to acculturate immigrants into the predominantly
Protestant culture of 19th-century America. The religion of the
early common school was a least-common-denominator Christianity
tending toward the Unitarianism of the schools' founding fathers.
Central Protestant doctrines like sin, and salvation by faith
in Christ were expunged as committee review of curriculum and
teaching took hold, implanting a more muted religion of good and
evil, along with a hefty dose of strictly civic morality. Catholics,
Jews, and Lutherans, often the alien target of the common school
movement, found their beliefs discouraged and discounted as 
&quot;sectarian&quot; in the new schools. So began the tradition of 
&quot;publicly-sponsored orthodoxy,&quot; as long-time education observer 
Stephen Arons calls it, in which the government defines through the 
public schools a set of &quot;normative&quot; values and beliefs.[21]

<p>

But even genuine efforts to find common ground are of little avail,
for education is the very enterprise of discovering and defending
first principles. It cannot be replaced by some &quot;value-neutral&quot;
process. As Aristotle said, education is about teaching the young
to lead the good life. Since men disagree about what the good
life is, men disagree about education. Glenn muses that &quot;we
may have set ourselves an impossible task in seeking to provide
a single model of education that is to be at once capable of nurturing
character and civic virtue and yet inoffensive to the conviction
of any parent.&quot;[22] Reformers eager to employ the common school
as an agent of social change offend parents' beliefs all the more.

<p>

The socialization mission is a flat violation of families' First
Amendment freedoms of belief and expression, argues Arons. The
First Amendment, he believes, not only protects parents' freedom
to express their beliefs, but also to pass on those beliefs to
their children.[23] Yet, compulsory public education forces parents
to surrender these tender matters of conscience to the political
majority. Aron continues, &quot;The level of coercion required
to resolve these value conflicts would be inconsistent with personal
liberty and political democracy.&quot;[24] While some argue that private
schools provide an adequate escape hatch from the public schools,
Arons argues that requiring parents to purchase their First Amendment
freedoms is as crass as taxing voters to enter the polls.

<p>

Thus, he concludes: &quot;[T]he present structure of public education
is unconstitutional because the primary victims of the unequal
distribution of liberty are the poor, working people and racial
minorities.&quot;[25] The comment reflects a subtle but critically
important reframing of the equity debate. By defining equity as
more nearly an &quot;equality of liberty,&quot; Arons offers a
fledgling strategy to help temper sharp oscillations between liberty
and equity, or private and public purposes, in education.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<font size=+1><b><i>

education as a predominantly<br>
private good.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

But Arons also casts specific doubt on the priority of the public
benefits of education: &quot;The legitimacy of the political consensus,
however weak, may be eliminated by government interference in
the process of belief and value formation.&quot;[26] Arons' searching
concern echoes the early 20th-century cautions of Princeton theologian
J. Gresham Machen that monopolistic state education would be &quot;the
most effective engine of tyranny and intellectual stagnation that
has yet been devised.&quot;[27] Machen argued that only competition
with private schools would keep the state schools healthy and
thus admonished a group of Christian school educators, &quot;May
the distinctiveness of your Christian schools never be lost; may
it never give place, by a false 'Americanization,' to a drab uniformity
which is the most un-American thing that could possibly be 
conceived!&quot;[28]

<p>

If coercion on matters of conscience results in further splintering
of communities, Arons seems to suggest government monopoly of
education may negate its public benefits altogether.

<p>

<center><h3>Are Vouchers the Right Mechanism?</h3></center>

<p>

If the argument for parental choice in education is based on the
philosophy of freedom from coercion, then the mechanism for choice
cannot be permitted to increase state coercion of parents or the
private sector.

<p>

Funding and regulation are the two defining characteristics of
public agencies, nearly always appearing hand in hand. The unhappy
results are dramatically evident in Canada, where some provinces'
religious and private schools are a part of the public school
system and receive state funding. Today many religious schools
depend heavily on subsidies from the Canadian government and have
subsequently lost their defining character.[29]

<p>

While voucher proponents originally made little distinction, today
they are careful to specify that voucher payments must flow directly
to parents or students -- not to private institutions. First Amendment
attorney William Bentley Ball argues that such precision is necessary
to sidestep potential entanglement problems.[30]

<p>

Nevertheless, many perceive the difference between aid to religious
institutions and aid to individuals to be only semantic and believe
vouchers do pose a threat to religious schools.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<font size=+1><b><i>

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The threat of future tinkering with the language of such laws
should not be dismissed, according to education researcher Chester
Finn. &quot;Some [private schools] to be sure, like to think they...can
obtain aid without saddling themselves with unacceptable forms
of regulation. But most...are more or less resigned to amalgamating
or choosing between assistance and autonomy.&quot;[31]

<p>

In the current federal political landscape, the compromises necessary
to achieve a winning voucher proposal come at too dear a price
for many would-be supporters. In the recent debate over vouchers
for the District of Columbia, the political payoff for the key
support of centrist Sen. Jim Jeffords (R-Vt.) was the surrender
of the basic principle for which every true religious school exists:
the fusion of faith and learning. Jeffords demanded and won the
addition of two provisions regarding religion. The first established
a religious opt-in provision requiring written consent from parents
for students to participate in religious courses or activities.
The second was even more worrisome to friends of religious liberty,
mandating that no school could use the voucher money to pay for
its religious courses or activities. Given such provisions, James
Cardinal Hickey made it clear that schools of the Archiocese of
Washington, D.C. would not participate in the voucher program.
With Catholic schools totalling some 80 percent of the private
schools in the city, the D.C. voucher scenario was nearly a re-run
of Alum Rock.

<p>

<center><h3>Concerns Specific to Means-Tested Vouchers</h3></center>

<p>

Means-tested vouchers, in particular, suffer from several potentially
fatal flaws. Assessing social reforms in the 1970s, Irving Kristol
comments that &quot;[p]ractically all social reforms 'work' in
that they do distribute some benefits to the people whom they
aim to help.&quot;[32] Means-tested vouchers would very likely 
&quot;work&quot; to improve the educational prospects of a few low-income 
children -- perhaps even helping to mold the next Clarence Thomas. Kristol
quickly notes, however, that there are two problems inherent in
giving money only to the poor.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Today many religious schools in<br>
Canada have come to depend heavily<br>
on subsidies from the government<br>
and have subsequently lost their<br>
defining character.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The primary difficulty is that means-tested benefits always establish
a huge disincentive for families on the margin to escape the poverty
trap.

<p>

Moreover, Kristol argues that means-tested benefits do a
grave disservice to a society by establishing an arbitrary definition
of &quot;poor.&quot;

<p>

Social reform, in other words, should actively seek to minimize
class conflict by advancing low- and middle-income interests in
tandem. A recent column by William Raspberry of <I>The Washington
Post</I> confirms the perspicacity of Kristol's insight. &quot;The
recent political trend,&quot; Raspberry observes, &quot;is to
legislate luck for entire classes of people. Some get the breaks,
and some get suckered. . . .It isn't that Americans no longer
care about the common good, but that they have lost faith in mutuality.
They're afraid of being played for suckers.&quot;[33]

<p>

Both survey and anecdotal evidence suggest that school voucher
proposals may indeed be falling prey to class resentment over
policies that tax Reagan voters to bestow benefits on Clinton
backers. In the wake of the school choice defeat in California,
pollster Frank Luntz found that seven out of 10 Californians said
they do not favor exclusive targeting of lower-income students.
On the other hand, two-thirds of all California voters said that
they would be willing to support choice in education in the future
if it did not cost any additional tax money.[34]

<p>

Gene Piccolo of the Choice in Education League in Minnesota reports
voter concern over the potential of the pending voucher initiative
in his state to create a new entitlement. He also reports a subtle
but distinctive undertone of middle-class suburbanite resentment
among voucher opponents -- perhaps, he believes, because Minnesota
already boasts one of the highest levels of public welfare spending
in the country.

<p>

&quot;Publicly-funded compassion fatigue&quot; may render means-tested
vouchers a political non-starter in other parts of the country
as well. The success of the privately- funded voucher (or scholarship)
movement, by contrast, suggests that Americans are beginning to
draw a sharp distinction between &quot;compassion&quot; and government
solutions -- and between &quot;compassion&quot; and equality in
the egalitarian sense.

<p>

<center><h3>A New Look at Tax Credits</h3></center>

<p>

Given the failure to establish a full educational choice program
anywhere in the U.S. after nearly a quarter century, choice proponents
must challenge themselves to develop a new scheme. The proposal
should place a premium on liberty and on the private benefits
of education while reformulating the public-purpose rhetoric employed
by the education establishment. A new proposal should also avoid
the weaknesses associated with vouchers, including the menace
of government regulation, consistent challenges to their constitutionality,
dim prospects for political passage, the danger of expanding an
entitlement mentality and a narrow coalition of beneficiaries
to support passage. A refundable tax credit scheme is more likely
to overleap these hurdles than means-tested voucher demonstration
projects.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The more universal the private benefits, the more likely the U.S.
Supreme Court will be to uphold the proposal. In the 1983 case
<I>Mueller v. Allen</I>, the court held that a program &quot;that
neutrally provides state assistance to a broad spectrum of citizens
is not readily subject to challenge under the Establishment 
Clause.&quot;[35] The program in question was a Minnesota tax deduction 
for tuition, transportation and textbooks, which had been broadly defined 
to include extra educational benefits for even public school students.

<p>

However, by defining &quot;allowable uses&quot; or &quot;eligible
institutions,&quot; tax benefits linked to tuition may carry the
same threat of regulation as vouchers. Or they might exclude religious
institutions altogether. But a refundable tax credit for the &quot;non-use
of the public school&quot; would avoid such meddling, eliminating
the need to define allowable uses of the tax credit. Since 
&quot;non-users&quot; of the public schools already exist, there would be 
no further need to define or regulate recipients. Recently proposed in 
Idaho, the tax credit for the non-use of the public school received a
favorable review from the state attorney general, who cited it
as fundamentally different from both the tuition tax credits and
the vouchers which the state's strict definition of separation
of church and state would prohibit. &quot;[T]he proposed initiative's
grant of the tax credit to parents of all non-public school students
-- home-schooled, private non-sectarian, and private parochial
-- coupled with the absence of a direct financial benefit to parochial
schools, makes it probable this proposal will be upheld under
the U.S. Constitution.&quot;[36]

<p>

A two-tiered mediating proposal might offer a small, &quot;standard&quot;
educational tax credit of perhaps $500 to all parents of school-aged
children, and a larger tax credit of up to $3,000 for &quot;itemized&quot;
educational expenditures, broadly defined to include everything
from enrichment experiences for the public school student to private
school tuition to home school expenses. (As a general rule, tax
credits should be no higher than the average cost of local private
school tuition -- which is generally $2,500 to $3,000.[37] If keyed
to the average public school per-pupil expenditure -- as some
voucher plans propose -- the efficiency of the marketplace is
undermined by artificial inflation.)

<p>

This would limit the threat of regulation while expanding the
coalition of beneficiaries.[38]

Any proposal, however, must be considered in light of state constitutions.
Given the variance among state constitutions, as exemplified by
Idaho and Minnesota, educational choice proposals are probably
best handled at the state level. State action will be increasingly
viable as grass-roots sentiment mounts to eliminate the federal
role in education.

<p>

<center><h3>Conclusion</h3></center>

<p>

In <I>Perspectives on the Reagan Years</I>, political analyst
John Palmer argues that the Reagan Administration heightened public
awareness of an inevitable tension among political values that
decades of economic prosperity had obscured. Palmer refers to
the tensions among efficiency, social equity, and individual liberty
-- the reconciliation of which John Maynard Keynes identified
as &quot;the political problem of mankind.&quot; Just as education
was one component of the Great Society poverty programs, educational
choice was a key component of the Reagan Administration's efforts
to remake the welfare state in the image of its own philosophy.
The Reagan Administration argued that the American version of
the welfare state unduly sacrificed both individual liberty and
efficiency in the pursuit of social justice and that more diligent
concern for the former would inevitably promote the latter.

<p>

Reagan officials trumpeted educational choice as a means to mediate
between the competing values of liberty and equality -- a role
that could not have been claimed for choice without a substantial
redefinition of equality in the wake of Great Society failures.
In the words of former Secretary of Education Lauro Cavazos, appointed
by Reagan, &quot;[e]vidence shows that the growing demand for
parental choice in the United States derives not simply from a
desire for improved test scores, but from changing perspectives
on liberty and equity. It flows from an urgent reconsideration
of the role of the family and of other institutions and associations
that mediate between the individual and the State.&quot;[39]

<p>

Conservative advocates of choice must move quickly to popularize
a definition of social justice that reserves respect for individual
liberty and the primacy of the family. A more thorough attempt
at reconciling &quot;equality&quot; with &quot;liberty&quot; is
beyond the scope of the present paper. Suffice it to say that
the central issue is human dignity; that the phrase &quot;all
men are created equal&quot; promises no more -- and no less --
than equal moral worth, and that freedom is the air that true
equality must breathe to survive.

<title>SPARE THE ROD? NEW RESEARCH CHALLENGES SPANKING CRITICS</title>

<h1>Spare the Rod?</h1>
<h2><i>New Research Challenges Spanking Critics</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>O</font>pposition to parents spanking their children has been 
growing significantly in elite circles over the past 15 years.[1] No doubt
much of this opposition springs from a sincere concern for the
well-being of children. Child abuse is a reality, and stories
of child abuse are horrifying. But while loving and effective
discipline is quite definitely <I>not</I> harsh and abusive, neither
is it weak and ineffectual. Indeed, disciplinary spanking can
fall well within the boundaries of loving discipline and need
not be labeled abusive violence.[2]

<p>

Or so most Americans seem to think.  According to a recent
Voter/Consumer Research poll commissioned by the Family Research
Council, 76 percent of the more than 1,000 Americans surveyed
said that spanking was an effective form of discipline in their
home when they were children.[3] These results are made all the
more impressive by the fact that nearly half of those who answered
otherwise grew up in homes in which they were never spanked.
Taken together, more than four out of five Americans who were
actually spanked by their parents as children say that it was
an effective form of discipline.

<p>

In addition, Americans perceive lack of discipline to be
the biggest problem in public education today, according to a
recent Gallup poll.[4] Several studies show strong public support
for corporal punishment by parents.[5]

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Critics claim that spanking a child is abusive and contributes
to adult dysfunction.  These allegations arise from studies that
fail to distinguish appropriate spanking from other forms of punishment.
Abusive forms of physical punishment such as kicking, punching,
and beating are commonly grouped with mild spanking.  Furthermore,
the studies usually include, and even emphasize, corporal punishment
of adolescents, rather than focusing on preschool children, where
spanking is more effective.  This blurring of distinctions between
spanking and physical abuse, and between children of different
ages, gives critics the illusion of having data condemning all
disciplinary spanking.

<p>

There are several arguments commonly leveled against disciplinary
spanking.  Interestingly, most of these arguments can be used
against other forms of discipline.  Any form of discipline (time-out,
restriction, etc.), when used inappropriately and in anger, can
result in distorting a child's perception of justice and harming
his emotional development.  In light of this, let us examine
some of the unfounded arguments promoted by spanking opponents.

<p>

<b>Argument #1:</b> <i>Many psychological studies show that spanking
is an improper form of discipline.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> Researchers John Lyons, Rachel Anderson
and David Larson of the National Institute of Healthcare Research
recently conducted a systematic review of the research literature
on corporal punishment.[6] They found that 83 percent of the 132
identified articles published in clinical and psychosocial journals
were merely opinion-driven editorials, reviews or commentaries,
devoid of new empirical findings.  Moreover, most of the empirical
studies were methodologically flawed by grouping the impact of
abuse with spanking.  The best studies demonstrated beneficial,
not detrimental, effects of spanking in certain situations.  Clearly,
there is insufficient evidence to condemn parental spanking and
adequate evidence to justify its proper use.

<p>

<b>Argument #2:</b> <i>Physical punishment establishes the moral
righteousness of hitting other persons who do something which
is regarded as wrong.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> The &quot;spanking teaches hitting&quot;
belief has gained in popularity over the past decade, but is not
supported by objective evidence.  A distinction must be made between
abusive hitting and nonabusive spanking.  A child's ability to
discriminate hitting from disciplinary spanking depends largely
upon the parents' attitude with spanking and the parents' procedure
for spanking.  There is no evidence in the medical literature
that a mild spank to the buttocks of a disobedient child by a
loving parent teaches the child aggressive behavior.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
The critical issue is<br>
how spanking is used<br>
more than whether it<br>
is used.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The critical issue is <I>how</I> spanking (or, in fact, any
punishment) is used more so than <I>whether</I> it is used.  Physical
abuse by an angry, uncontrolled parent will leave lasting emotional
wounds and cultivate bitterness and resentment within a child.
The balanced, prudent use of disciplinary spanking, however,
is an effective deterrent to aggressive behavior with some children.

<p>

Researchers at the Center for Family Research at Iowa State
University studied 332 families to examine both the impact of
corporal punishment and the quality of parental involvement on
three adolescent outcomes -- aggressiveness, delinquency, and
psychological well-being.  The researchers found a strong association
between the quality of parenting and each of these three outcomes.
Corporal  punishment, however, was <I>not</I> adversely related
to any of these outcomes.  This study proves the point that quality
of parenting is the chief determinant of favorable or unfavorable
outcomes.[7] Remarkably, childhood aggressiveness has been more
closely linked to maternal permissiveness and negative criticism
than to even abusive physical discipline.[8]

<p>

It is unrealistic to expect that children would never hit
others if their parents would only exclude spanking from their
discipline options.  Most children in their toddler years (long
before they are ever spanked) naturally attempt to hit others
when conflict or frustration arises.  The continuation of this
behavior is largely determined by how the parent or caregiver
responds. If correctly disciplined, the hitting will become less
frequent. If ignored or ineffectively disciplined, the hitting
will likely persist and even escalate.  Thus, instead of contributing
to greater violence, spanking can be a useful component in an
overall plan to effectively teach a child to stop aggressive hitting.

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<b>Argument #3:</b> <i>Since parents often refrain from hitting
until the anger or frustration reaches a certain point, the child
learns that anger and frustration justify the use of physical
force.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> A study published in <I>Pediatrics</I> indicates
that most parents who spank do not spank on impulse, but purposefully
spank their children with a belief in its effectiveness.[9] Furthermore,
the study revealed no significant correlation between the frequency
of spanking and the anger reported by mothers.  Actually, the
mothers who reported being angry were not the same parents who
spanked.

<p>

Reactive, impulsive hitting after losing control due to anger
is unquestionably the wrong way for a parent to use corporal punishment.
Eliminating all physical punishment in the home, however, would
not remedy such explosive scenarios.  It could even increase the
problem.  When effective spanking is removed from a parent's disciplinary
repertoire, he or she is left with nagging, begging, belittling,
and yelling, once the primary disciplinary measures -- such as time-out
and logical consequences -- have failed.  By contrast, if proper
spanking is proactively used in conjunction with other disciplinary
measures, better control of the particularly defiant child can
be achieved, and moments of exasperation are less likely to occur.

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<b>Argument #4:</b> <i>Physical punishment is harmful to a child.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> Any disciplinary measure, physical, verbal
or emotional, carried to an extreme can harm a child.  Excessive
scolding and berating of a child by a parent is emotionally harmful.
Excessive use of isolation (time-out) for unreasonable periods
of time can humiliate a child and ruin the measure's effectiveness.
Obviously, excessive or indiscriminate physical punishment is
harmful and abusive.  However, an appropriately-administered spanking
of a forewarned disobedient child is not harmful when administered
in a loving controlled manner.

<p>

Without the prudent use of spanking for the particularly
defiant child, a parent runs the risk of being inconsistent and
rationalizing the child's behavior.  This inconsistent manner
of  parenting is confusing and harmful to the child and is damaging
to the parent-child relationship.  There is no evidence that proper
disciplinary spanking is harmful to the child.

<p>

<b>Argument #5:</b> <i>Physical punishment makes the child angry
at the parent.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> All forms of punishment initially elicit
a frustrated, angry response from a child.  Progression of this
anger is dependent primarily upon the parent's attitude during
and after the disciplinary event, and the manner of its application.
Any form of punishment administered angrily for purposes of retribution,
rather than calmly for purposes of correction, can create anger
and resentment in a child.  Actually, a spanking can break the
escalating rage of a rebellious child and more quickly restore
the relationship between parent and child.

<font size=+1><b><i>
The use of the term<br>
'violence' in the<br>
spanking debate only<br>
serves to deepen the<br>
confusion.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<b>Argument #6:</b> <i>Spanking teaches a child that &quot;might
makes right,&quot; that power and strength are most important
and that the biggest can force their will upon the smallest.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> Parental power is commonly exerted in routine
child rearing and spanking is only one example.  Other situations
where power and restraint are exercised by the average parent
include:

<p><ul>

<li>The young child who insists on running from his parent in
a busy mall or parking lot.

<p>

<li>The toddler who refuses to sit in his car seat.

<p>

<li>The young patient who refuses to hold still as a vaccination
is administered, or as a laceration is repaired.

</ul><p>

Power and control over the child are necessary at times to
ensure safety, health and proper behavior. Classic child rearing
studies have shown that some degree of power, assertion,[10] and firm
control[11] is essential for optimal child rearing. When power is
exerted in the context of love and for the child's benefit, the
child will not perceive it as bullying or demeaning.

<h2>A CLOSER LOOK</h2>

<p><hr width=60% noshade><p>

<h2>Distinguishing Spanking from Abuse</h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>C</font>orporal punishment is often defined broadly as 
<i>bodily punishment of any kind.</i> Since this definition includes 
spanking as well as obviously abusive acts such as kicking, punching, 
beating, face slapping, and even starvation, more specific definitions
must be used to separate appropriate versus inappropriate corporal
punishment.

<p>

Spanking is one of many disciplinary responses available
to parents intended to shape appropriate behavior in the developing
toddler and child.  It is an adjunctive corrective measure, to
be used in combination with primary responses such as restraint,
natural and logical consequences, time-out, and restriction of
privileges.

<p>

Child development experts believe spanking should be used
mainly as a back-up to primary measures, and then independently
to correct deliberate and persistent problem behavior that is
not remedied with milder measures.  It is most useful with toddlers
and preschoolers from 18 months to 6 years of age, when reasoning
is less persuasive.

<p>

Moreover, child development experts say that spanking should
always be a planned action by a parent, not an impulsive reaction
to misbehavior.  The child should be forewarned of the spanking
consequence for each of the designated problem behaviors.  Spanking
should always be administered in private. It should consist of
one or two spanks to the child's buttocks, followed by a calm
review of the offense and the desired behavior.

<i>The Act</i>         Spanking: One or two        Beating: To strike repeatedly

<i>The Effects</i>     Behavioral correction       Emotional and physical injury 
</pre>

</center>

<p><hr><p>

<b>Argument #7:</b> <i>Spanking is violence.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> Spanking, as recommended by most primary
care physicians,[12] is not violence by definition (&quot;exertion
of physical force so as to injure or abuse&quot;).[13] Parents who
properly spank do not injure or abuse their child.

<p>

The use of this term &quot;violence&quot; in the spanking
debate only serves to deepen the confusion.  Why do anti-spanking
authors repeatedly fail to distinguish between abusive violence
and mild spanking?  The distinction is so fundamental and obvious
that its omission suggests that these authors use such terminology
for its propaganda value, not to clarify issues.

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<b>Argument #8:</b> <i>Spanking is an ineffective solution to
misbehavior.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> Though the specific use of appropriate spanking
has rarely been studied, there is evidence of its short-term and
long-term effectiveness. When combined with reasoning, the use
of negative consequences (including spanking) does effectively
decrease the frequency of misbehavior recurrences with preschool
children.[14] In clinical field trials where parental spanking has
been studied, it has consistently been found to reduce the subsequent
frequency of noncompliance with time-out.[15] Spanking, as a effective
enforcer of time-out, is a component of several well-researched
parent training programs[16] and popular parenting texts.[17]

<p>

Dr. Diana Baumrind of the Institute for Human Development
at the University of California-Berkeley, conducted a decade-long
study of families with children 3 to 9 years old.[18]
Baumrind found that parents employing a balanced disciplinary
style of firm control (including spanking) and positive encouragement
experienced the most favorable outcome in their children. Parents
taking extreme approaches to discipline (authoritarian-types using
excessive punishment with less encouragement or permissive-types
using little punishment and no spanking) were less successful.

<p>

Baumrind concluded that evidence from this study &quot;did
not indicate that negative reinforcement or corporal punishment
per se were harmful or ineffective procedures, but rather the
total patterns of parental control determined the effects on the
child of these procedures.&quot;

<p>

This approach of balanced parenting, employing the occasional
use of spanking, is advocated by several child rearing experts.[19]
In the hands of loving parents, a spanking to the buttocks of
a defiant toddler in appropriate settings is a powerful motivator
to correct behavior and an effective deterrent to disobedience.

<p>

<b>Argument #9:</b> <i>Adults who were spanked as children are
at risk for using violence as a means of resolving conflicts as
adults.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> This theory comes from work done by Murray
Straus of the Family Research Lab at the University of New Hampshire.
Straus' conclusions are based upon theoretical models and survey
results of adults recalling spankings as teenagers. His work
is not clinical research, and many experts believe that his conclusions
go far beyond his data.  As with most of Straus' survey research,
teenage spanking is the focus, not the selective use of spanking
of young children by reasonable parents. The evidence for his
conclusion disappears when parental spanking is measured between
the ages of 2 and 8 years, and when childhood aggression is measured
at a later age.

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

In a 1994 review article on corporal punishment, Dr. Robert
E. Larzelere, a director of research at Boys Town, Nebraska, presents
evidence supporting a parent's selective use of spanking of children,
particularly those 2 to 6 years old.[20] After thoroughly reviewing
the literature, Larzelere concludes that any association between
spanking and antisocial aggressiveness in children is insignificant
and artifactual.

<p>

After a decade of longitudinal study of children beginning
in third grade, Dr. Leonard Eron found no association between
punishment (including spanking) and later aggression.  Eron, a
clinical psychologist at the Univeristy of Michigan's Institute
for Social Research, concluded, &quot;Upon follow-up 10 years
after the original data collection, we found that punishment of
aggressive acts at the earlier age was no longer related to current
aggression, and instead, other variables like parental nurturance
and children's identification with their parents were more important
in predicting later aggression.&quot;[21]

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Again, it is the total pattern of parenting that determines the
outcome of a parent's efforts.

<p>

<b>Argument #10:</b> <i>Spanking leads a parent to use harmful
forms of corporal punishment which lead to physical child abuse.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> The abuse potential when loving parents
use appropriate disciplinary spanking is very low.  Since parents
have a natural affection for their children, they are more prone
to underutilize spanking than to overutilize it.  Both empirical
data and professional opinion oppose the concept of a causal relationship
between spanking and child abuse.

<p>

Surveys indicate that 70 to 90 percent of parents of preschoolers
use spanking,[22] yet the incidence of physical child abuse in
America is only about 5 percent. Statistically, the two practices
are far apart. Furthermore, over the past decade reports of child
abuse have steadily risen while approval for parental spanking
has steadily declined.[23]

<p>

More than 70 percent of primary care pediatricians reject
the idea that spanking sets the stage for parents to engage in
forms of physical abuse.[24]

<p>

Teaching parents appropriate spanking may actually reduce
child abuse, according to Larzelere, in his 1994 review article
on corporal punishment.[25] Parents who are ill-equipped to control
their child's behavior, or who take a more permissive approach
(refusing to use spanking), may be more prone to anger[26] and explosive
attacks on their child.[27]

<p>

Parental child abuse is an interactive process involving
parental competence, parental and child temperaments, and situational
demands.[28] Abusive parents are more angry, depressed and impulsive,
and emphasize punishment as the predominant means of discipline.
Abused children are more aggressive and less compliant than children
from nonabusive families. There is less interaction between family
members in abusive families and abusive mothers display more negative
than positive behavior. The etiology of abusive parenting is
multifactorial with emphasis on the personalities involved, and
cannot be simply explained by a parent's use of spanking.

<p>

In a letter to the editor in a 1995 issue of <I>Pediatrics</I>,
Drs. Lawrence S. Wissow and Debra Roter of Johns Hopkins University's
pediatrics department acknowledge that a definitive link between
spanking and child abuse has yet to be established.[29]

<p>

Finally, the Swedish experiment to reduce child abuse by
banning spanking seems to be failing.  In 1980, one year after
this ban was adopted, the rate of child beatings was twice that
of the United States.[30] According to a 1995 report from the government
organization Statistics Sweden, police reports of child abuse
by family members rose four-fold from 1984 to 1994, while reports
of teen violence increased nearly six-fold.[31]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Most experts agree that spanking and child abuse are not
on the same continuum, but are very different entities.  With
parenting, it is the &quot;user&quot; and <I>how</I> a measure
is used much more than the measure used that determines the outcome
of the disciplinary effort.  Clearly, spanking can be safely used
in the discipline of young children with an excellent outcome.
The proper use of spanking may actually reduce a parent's risk
of abusing the child.

<p>

<b>Argument #11:</b> <i>Spanking is never necessary.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> All children need a combination of encouragement
and correction as they are disciplined to become socially responsible
individuals. In order for correction to deter disobedient behavior,
the consequence imposed upon the child must outweigh the pleasure
of the disobedient act. For very compliant children, milder forms
of correction will suffice and spanking may never be necessary.
For more defiant children who refuse to comply with or be persuaded
by milder consequences such as time-out, spanking is useful, effective,
and appropriate.

<center><h3>Conclusion</h3></center>

<p>

The subject of disciplinary spanking should be evaluated
from a factual and philosophical perspective. It must be distinguished
from abusive, harmful forms of corporal punishment. Appropriate
disciplinary spanking can play an important role in optimal child
development, and has been found in prospective studies to be a
part of the parenting style associated with the best outcomes.
There is no evidence that mild spanking is harmful. Indeed,
spanking is supported by history, research, and a majority of
primary care physicians.

<h2>Guidelines for Disciplinary Spanking</h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>T</font>he following are guidelines that Dr. Den Trumball 
has used to advise the parents he serves in disciplining children. 
These guidelines should help policymakers appreciate the legitimacy
of disciplinary spanking.

<p>

1. Spanking should be used selectively for clear, deliberate
misbehavior, particularly that which arises from a child's persistent
defiance of a parent's instruction.  It should be used only when
the child receives at least as much encouragement and praise for
good behavior as correction for problem behavior.

<p>

2. Milder forms of discipline, such as verbal correction,
time-out, and logical consequences, should be used initially,
followed by spanking when noncompliance persists.  Spanking has
shown to be an effective method of enforcing time-out with the
child who refuses to comply.

<p>

3. Only a parent (or in exceptional situations, someone else
who has an intimate relationship of authority with the child)
should administer a spanking.

<p>

4. Spanking should not be administered on impulse or when a parent
is out of control.  A spanking should always be motivated by love
for the purpose of teaching and correcting, never for revenge.

<p>

5. Spanking is inappropriate before 15 months of age and is usually
not necessary until after 18 months.  It should be less necessary
after 6 years, and rarely, if ever, used after 10 years of age.

<p>

6. After 10 months of age, one slap to the hand of a stubborn
crawler or toddler may be necessary to stop serious misbehavior
when distraction and removal have failed.  This is particularly
the case when the forbidden object is immovable and dangerous,
such as a hot oven door or an electrical outlet.

<p>

7. Spanking should always be a planned action, not a reaction,
by the parent and should follow a deliberate procedure.

<p><ul>

<li>The child should be forewarned of the spanking consequence
for designated problem behaviors.

<p>

<li>Spanking should always be administered in private (bedroom
or restroom) to avoid public humiliation or embarassment.

<p>

<li>One or two spanks should be administered to the buttocks.
This is followed by embracing the child and calmly reviewing
the offense and the desired behavior in an effort to reestablish
a warm relationship.

</ul><p>

8. Spanking should leave only transient redness of the skin and
should never cause physical injury.

<p>

9. If properly administered spankings are ineffective, other
appropriate disciplinary responses should be tried, or the parent
should seek professional help. Parents should never increase
the intensity of spankings.

<title>FREEING AMERICA'S SCHOOLS</title>

<body>

<h1>Freeing America's Schools</h1>
<h2><i>The Case Against the U.S. Education Department</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>A</font> century and a half ago, Alexis de 
Tocqueville recognized that increased centralization and 
bureaucratization saps civic and individual responsibility. 
"[A] centralized administration is fit only to enervate the 
nations in which it exists, by incessantly diminishing their 
local spirit",[1] wrote Tocqueville.

<p>

Cathy Duffy, in a new book titled <i>Government Nannies</i>, 
echoes Tocqueville's observation: "History and common sense 
tell us that people are more likely to assume responsibility 
when they know that no one else will.  If I knew that no one 
else was going to watch my car's gas gauge and remind me to 
fill the tank before it hits empty, I would do it myself.  
But my husband watches it closely and puts gas in the car for 
me.  As a result of his kindness, I rarely look at the gas gauge."[2]

<p>

Unfortunately, many Americans seem to have forgotten this principle 
and have yielded responsibility for certain domestic functions to 
central planners working in the federal government.  Nowhere is 
this more apparent than in the area of education, where increased 
bureaucratic control has bred local apathy which, in turn, has bred 
greater bureaucratic control.  Indeed, many contemporary Americans 
resemble the 19th century European described by Tocqueville:

<p>

<blockquote><i>

The condition of his village, the police of his street, the 
repairs of the church or the parsonage, do not concern him; 
for he looks upon all these things as unconnected with himself 
and as the property of a powerful stranger whom he calls the 
government....  This want of interest in his own affairs goes 
so far that if his own safety or that of his children is at last 
endangered, instead of trying to avert the peril, he will fold 
his arms and wait till the whole nation comes to his aid....</i>[3]

</blockquote>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Tocqueville warns that, when a nation reaches this point, 
"it must either change its customs and its laws, or perish; 
for the source of public virtues is dried up; and though it 
may contain subjects, it has no citizens."[4]

<p>

<center><h3>Ending the Federal Role in Education</h3></center>

<p>

The United States Constitution is a document of enumerated powers. 
That is, the Federal government is permitted to do only what the 
Constitution specifically lists.  This is expressed clearly and 
succinctly in the 10th amendment:   "The powers not delegated to 
the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved 
to the States respectively, or to the people."

<p>

Since education is not listed as a Federal responsibility, it was 
exclusively under the jurisdiction of states and localities through 
most of our history.  Things began to change in the 1930s when the 
New Deal brought increasing Federal involvement.  Later, under 
Eisenhower, a cabinet-level department was created:  Health, 
Education and Welfare.  And under the Johnson Administration, 
passage of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act expanded 
federal involvement further.

<p>

Then, in 1976, Democratic presidential nominee Jimmy Carter 
promised the creation of a separate education department if 
elected and received the backing of the National Education 
Association (NEA) as a result.  In 1979, President Carter set 
about to make good on his promise.  But there was strong opposition 
from the American Federation of Teachers (the second-largest teacher 
union), from much of higher education, and from the general public. 
The AFL-CIO attacked the idea[5] and even the liberal <i>Washington 
Post</i> argued that "shifting federal education programs to a 
separate department increases bureaucratic costs."[6]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Hawaiians could manage these<br>
programs more efficiently and<br>
less expensively than the federal<br>
government. And if Hawaiians, then<br>
why not Carolinians, Vermonters,<br>
and Texans, as well?
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Many Americans feared that a cabinet-level department would 
lead to an expanded federal role in education.  Marvin Stone, 
in an editorial in <i>U.S. News & World Report</i>, put it 
this way:   Would the Education Department have the power to 
tamper with America's traditional local control of education? 
Of course it would.  Where there is money to be given, there 
is the implicit responsibility to make sure that it is spent 
according to the purposes of the donors  -- or else.[7]

<p>

While the bill establishing the department stated emphatically 
that the Department would not undermine state and local control, 
Stone noted:

<p>

<blockquote><i>

...a subtle schizophrenia, meandering through the legislation and 
the committee appraisal, suggests that the authors' inward dream 
for the department runs at odds with the stated restrictions. One 
keeps encountering such phrases as  "implement...at the local level" 
...  "assesses the achievement of federal objectives" ... and 
"monitoring parental and public participation."</i>[8]

</blockquote>

<p>

Today, Stone's essay seems prophetic.  The <i>Guide to U.S. 
Department of Education Programs</i> lists 241 separate programs, 
many of which have usurped the prerogatives of the states.  For 
example, the index identifies six programs exclusively for Native 
Hawaiians.  It is instructive to imagine tax monies garnered in 
Oahu, transferred to a federal bureaucracy 6,000 miles away, 
filtered expensively through Washington's education blob, and the 
remainder returned to the island state for Native Hawaiian 
education.  It is not difficult to believe that Hawaiians could 
manage these programs more efficiently and less expensively than 
the federal government.  And if Hawaiians, then why not Carolinians, 
Vermonters, and Texans as well?

<p>

The U.S. Education Department, then, is an entity with a dubious 
past.  Its conception was of doubtful legitimacy, given the 
strictures of Constitution and tradition.  The circumstances 
of its birth were suspect -- more or less a political payoff 
to the NEA.  Furthermore, the U.S. Education Department has 
not improved American education.

<p>

Before its creation, President Carter could point to  "[o]ur 
Nation's pluralistic education system" as "the most competent 
and open in the world...."[9] No longer so.  According to 
former Secretary of Education William Bennett, more than 90 
percent of the students entering U.S. colleges would not be 
admitted to post-secondary education anywhere else in the world.[10] 
The 1990 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) declared 
that as many as half of elementary and secondary students do not 
demonstrate  "competency in challenging subject matter in English, 
mathematics, science, history, and geography.  Further, even fewer 
are able to use their minds well."[11]

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Meanwhile, the U.S. Education Department has grown into a huge 
bureaucratic blob.  It has elbowed its way into places it does 
not belong, not the least of which are local schools and family 
life.

<p>

<center><h3>Goals 2000</h3></center>

<p>

On March 31, 1994, federal intrusiveness reached a new height with 
passage of Goals 2000.  Groundwork for the program was being laid 
as early as 1987 when Richard Riley and Hillary Rodham Clinton 
served on the Southern Regional Education Board's (SREB) Commission 
on Educational Quality.  Bill Clinton also participated in SREB 
meetings.  The commission developed a set of goals and published 
<i>Goals for Education:  Challenge 2000</i> in 1988.[12] In 1989, 
President Bush summoned the nation's governors to an educational 
summit meeting in Charlottesville, Virginia.  At this gathering, 
then-Governor Clinton played a major role in leading the governors 
to adopt six ambitious national goals for education.  These goals 
formed the basis of America 2000, President Bush's plan for 
education reform.

<p>

The America 2000 plan represented a dramatic departure from 
the American political tradition in education, as explained 
by John F. Jennings, director of the Center on National 
Education Policy:

<p>

<blockquote><i>

Democratic Presidents Kennedy and Johnson had proposed a major 
expansion of federal aid to education in the 1960s and had 
achieved the enactment of historic legislation that created 
the current array of federal programs.  But they were dogged 
along the way by criticism from conservatives who asserted that 
the liberals were really trying to nationalize education.  Now, 
25 years later, it was a self-proclaimed conservative Republican, 
not a liberal Democrat, who was advocating <b>a monumental 
movement away from local control of education</b>.</i>[13] 
<i>(emphasis added)

</i></blockquote>

<p>

While Bush failed to get both Houses of Congress to adopt his 
plan, President Clinton was quick to seize the initiative on 
this issue soon after his election in 1992.  Clinton expanded 
Bush's plan, renamed it Goals 2000, and made it the cornerstone 
of his Education Department's agenda.

<p>

The reach of Goals 2000 as educational innovation can hardly be 
overstated.  Albert Shanker of the American Federation of 
Teachers called it  "the most important piece of education 
legislation we've ever had."[14] And Secretary of Education 
Richard Riley wrote,  "For the first time in the nation's 
history, a statutory framework defining an appropriate role 
for the federal government has been enacted."[15]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Goals 2000 includes national<br>
education goals and standards<br>
that override local priorities<br>
and ignore the fact that many<br>
private entities have developed<br>
standards for student learning.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Goals 2000 provides a framework for restructuring the American 
system of education, creating tighter and more definite links 
between the federal, state and local levels.  This makes it 
even easier for the Education Department to tamper with local 
schools than Marvin Stone once envisioned.

<p>

Indeed, Goals 2000 includes national education goals and standards 
that override local priorities and ignore the fact that many 
private entities have developed standards for student learning. 
E.D. Hirsch, for example, has written a series of books on cultural 
literacy, describing fundamentals of education at each grade level. 
The Family Research Council has published an outline of U.S. history 
entitled <i>Let Freedom Ring</i>. William Bennett's best-selling 
<i>Book of Virtues</i> is a wonderful source of America's literary 
heritage.  All of these examples meet the need for high academic 
standards.

<p>

What is revolutionary about Goals 2000 is the idea that the federal 
government should be involved in creating and certifying standards 
for education and in determining  "official knowledge."

<p>

The goals, themselves, are highly problematic.  First, they smack 
of Utopianism.  They illustrate the 
"with-a-stroke-of-this-pen-I-change-the-world" kind of thought that 
sometimes afflicts high-level bureaucrats and politicians. For 
example,[16] Goal Six says that every adult American will be 
literate.  Since some estimates put the number of adult illiterates 
at nearly four million and the number of functional illiterates at 
30 million, their re-education would require a national mobilization 
akin to fighting World War I.  And these are <b>adults</b> -- 
outside the scope of compulsory education.  Goals like this with 
a timetable like this (all problems solved in six years!) are so 
unrealistic as to undermine public confidence in the politicians 
and the educational establishment.

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The goals also have coercive implications.  Goal One says "all 
children in America will start school ready to learn."  Assuming 
the statement is not mere rhetoric, how will the government meet 
this goal?  Or consider Goal Eight:   "Every school will promote 
partnerships that will increase parental involvement and 
participation in promoting the social, emotional, and academic 
growth of children."  Note the peremptory  "will": these 
"partnerships" are not optional.  They instruct school officials 
to direct parents rather than stating that parents are to be 
primarily responsible for their children's education. Moreover, 
Goals 2000 defines parental involvement in mostly peripheral 
terms: parent-teacher conferences, PTA meetings, etc.

<p>

Goal Three says that "American students will leave grade four, 
eight, and twelve having demonstrated competency in challenging 
subject matter...."  Who decides what  "challenging subject matter" 
is, and what is  "demonstrated competency" over it?  The Goals 2000 
law created a new federal agency, the National Educational Standards 
and Improvement Council (NESIC).  Under the law, states may draw up 
state educational standards or use the national standards that will 
also be made available.  All of this was declared, in the Goals 2000 
law itself, to be entirely voluntary.  Indeed, among its supporters, 
Goals 2000 is hardly mentioned without the assuring  "voluntary" 
prefix.  Calling it  "voluntary" is actually highly misleading, 
especially in light of other legislation.  As Secretary of Education 
Richard Riley said of the Goals 2000 law,  "We were determined that 
Goals 2000 become the prism through which amendments to every other 
program in elementary and secondary education would be considered."[17]

<p>

One such program is the Elementary and Secondary Education Act 
(ESEA), under which 90 percent of the schools in the nation 
receive funding.  Under <i>this</i> law states cannot receive federal 
funding for elementary and secondary education unless they follow 
an application process nearly identical to that contained in Goals 
2000.  In fact the ESEA declares that  "[i]f a State has State 
content standards or State student performance standards developed 
under title III of the Goals 2000:  Educate America Act and an 
aligned set of assessments...the State shall use such standards 
and assessments"[18] as its plan to be submitted for application 
purposes.

<p>

Some argue that Goals 2000 is voluntary because states are free to 
write standards of their own.  The catch is that even these state 
standards must be approved by the U.S. Department of Education in 
order for the state to receive Goals 2000 funds.  What kind of 
standards are the feds likely to approve?  Since there will be 
federal standards and curriculum for each discipline, no state 
will be left guessing.  And no one who understands human nature 
will be left guessing about what all the states' materials will 
tend to look like. "National standards" sounds challenging: 
they aren't. The U.S. Education Department, for example, recently 
sued Ohio for imposing an eighth grade reading requirement as a 
condition of high school graduation. The standard was too 
restrictive, too discriminatory. Thus, "national standards" 
could actually work to  "dumb down" educational expectations, 
rather than to raise them.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center><h3>Faulty Standards</h3></center>

<p>

Consider the U.S. history standards, written by the Center for 
History in the Schools at UCLA under a $2 million grant from the 
U.S. Education Department and the National Endowment for the 
Humanities.  They contain many historical facts and interesting 
teaching strategies.  But nothing could better demonstrate the 
dangers of a national curriculum.  The standards are replete 
with political correctness.  Paul Revere, Thomas Edison, J.P. 
Morgan, the Wright Brothers, Alexander Graham Bell, Robert E. 
Lee, and Albert Einstein are all omitted; yet, Madonna, Speckled 
Snake and The Simpsons are included.

<p>

The standards not only trivialize American history, but also 
present an exceedingly gloomy view of America.  Nobody wants 
a history written through rose-colored glasses --  but the 
standards go beyond an honest appraisal of national failures, 
replacing  "America: land of opportunity," with  "America: land 
of oppression."  As Albert Shanker pointed out, no other 
government has tried to teach its children to have negative 
feelings about their own country.[19]

<p>

Political correctness also colors many of the questions and 
assignments in the history standards.  For example, students 
are asked to  "explain how feminism was compelling in its 
analysis of women's problems and solutions offered."  To the 
ideologically charged individuals who wrote the standards, 
feminist ideology could only be  "compelling."  But for many 
Americans, this premise is highly debatable.  That there is 
such a disagreement should not be a problem.  Histories should 
acknowledge diversity of opinion, instead of pretending that all 
people hold the same views.  It is highly ironic that those whose 
very creed is  "diversity" should seek to ignore and marginalize 
opinion when it differs from their own.

<p>

Another weakness of the standards has been little noted in the 
national discussion:  they contain virtually no explanation of 
what communism is and what it did.  It is difficult to see how 
any student could make sense of the 20th century without 
understanding what Marx and Lenin taught and how Stalin acted 
on those teachings.  The Cold War for example -- nearly half a 
century of American history -- becomes inexplicable.  During this 
century, Soviet Communism was responsible for at least 60 million 
deaths.  Adding Communist China brings the toll to many millions 
more.  Without an understanding of this, the student could only 
consider the collision of democracy and Communism to be like some 
pointless dynastic or boundary-marker squabble of the distant past.

<p>

Indeed, the history standards implicitly subscribe to the doctrine 
of moral equivalence, describing the Cold War merely as "swordplay 
of the Soviet Union and the United States," and making no mention of 
Soviet invasions of Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan.  They 
describe  "Soviet advances in space" and the <i>Challenger</i> 
disaster, while omitting any reference to John Glenn or the successful 
U.S. moon landing.  Columnist George Will says they show a "cranky 
anti-Americanism."[20]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

How is it possible that a program like Goals 2000 -- quite inimical 
to American tradition -- has become the manual for running local 
schools?  Partly, as we have seen, through subterfuge: the 
insistent repetition that it is entirely voluntary.  Partly because 
the profound crisis of American education has convinced many that 
only an enormous federal initiative can cope with it.  But this 
conviction is based on the fallacy that the federal government has 
money of its own.  In reality, the only money the U.S. Education 
Department has is money that citizens once earned.  Think back to 
the example of the federal programs for Native Hawaiians.  They 
typify every federal education program:  the money localities give 
up to Washington is returned to them -- much diminished.  The 
total U.S. Education Department budget has reached a level of $30 
billion dollars.  What if this money were simply routed to the local 
schools instead of being routed through the federal bureaucracy? It 
tickles the imagination to think of the textbooks and desks and 
computers and art classes and chemistry labs and gymnasiums and 
field trips and new teachers that could be financed with the savings.

<p>

There would be another great advantage for localities if the 
federal government got out of the education business.  There 
is a misperception that Washington provides the lion's share 
of education funding in this nation.  In reality, federal 
spending accounts for only about 6.5 percent[21] of the funding 
that goes into local education. Yet, "Uncle Sam's leverage 
over U.S. education is greater than his six or seven percent of 
the school budget would indicate," notes Chester Finn, former 
assistant secretary of education under President Reagan.[22] 
Overbearing federal regulations hinder local school freedom. 
Getting the federal education bureaucracy out of our pockets 
and off our backs should liberate local leaders and infuse 
communities with a new sense of local spirit.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

President Carter, arguing in 1979 for the establishment of a U.S. 
Education Department, boasted: "Under the proposal I am submitting 
today, the Department of Education will include more than 150 programs 
and 16,200 employees.  With a budget of more than $13 billion, this 
Department will be larger than five other Departments including Energy, 
Commerce, Justice, Interior and State."[23] Such was the sentiment with 
which the U.S. Education Department was formed.  Few politicians would 
dare to highlight these facts today.  In its 15 years of existence the 
U.S. Education Department has added 100 programs, more than doubled its 
annual expenditures, and doubled its outlays as a percentage of total 
federal spending, from one percent to two percent.[24] In hindsight, 
it is clear that enlarging the federal role in education was a mistake. 
As early as 1981, policy analysts recognized that "the creation of this 
Department was a mistake, that its enactment is analogous to an inversion 
of the proverbial miller's tale, spinning something fine back into 
something coarse."[25] The federal government should no longer have a 
role in American education.

<p>

<center><h3>Common Objections</h3></center>

<p>

Some argue that the U.S. Education Department must be preserved 
because of four seemingly critical functions of the federal department: 
helping the disabled, protecting civil rights, providing college loans, 
and conducting national educational research.  But there is reason to 
believe that these functions can be handled by state and local 
governments and by private entities.  Indeed, one-size-fits-all 
administrative policies handed down by the federal government have 
often proved counter-productive.  Consider, for example, special 
education.

<p>

The federal government's spending on special education accounts for 
a very small percentage of the cost of educating each student with 
disabilities -- only eight percent.  Yet, its regulations define the 
special education policies which local schools must follow.

<p>

The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) began two 
decades ago with the purpose of providing all children with handicaps 
a "free and appropriate public education."  After many reauthorizations 
and amendments, the federal special education requirements are now 
numerous, detailed and cumbersome.  Schools are instructed to place 
students in the  "least restrictive environment."  Today this policy 
is defined as full inclusion.  That means that the regular classroom 
must be the first option for all children with handicaps, and many in 
the education establishment, ignoring the fact that diverse needs require 
diverse solutions, are determined to make the regular classroom the "best 
option" by bringing in aides, special materials, equipment, etc.[26] As 
Albert Shanker has said,  "The argument on the part of inclusionists 
rests on the social benefits of education.  Some have even stated that 
they don't care if other children don't learn to read and write, if 
they have learned to 'get along.'"[27]

<p>

The federally mandated policy of inclusion presents an excellent 
example of why a federal Education Department is ineffective and 
inappropriate.  A single national policy cannot meet the needs of 
all students.  Nowhere is this more true than in special education, 
where a student's learning depends largely on how closely teaching 
methods meet his or her needs.  Those closest to the student with 
special needs -- parents and teachers -- should have authority to 
shape policy so it will be appropriate for that student.

<p>

Just as the U.S. Department of Education is poorly suited to the 
task of setting special education policies, it is poorly suited 
to the task of protecting the civil rights of students.

<p>

Civil rights issues in schools today are not significantly different 
from those in any other arena of American life.  To guarantee 
students equal protection under the law, the function of preserving 
civil rights in schools should be moved to the U.S. Justice Department. 
Schools have broken the chains of discrimination, and minority students 
have made considerable progress as a result.  Indeed, one of the few 
success stories in American education in the last three decades is the 
reduced disparity in the relative achievement and graduation rates of 
white and minority students.[28]

<p>

In dealing with schools, the Justice Department must heed the advice 
given in 1981 to the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) in the Education 
Department:

<p>

<blockquote><i>

The civil rights of individuals are fundamental, and should not be 
abridged.  But the role of the OCR...needs to be narrowed so as to 
allow state and local education officials to develop programs which 
will take into consideration the unique situations of particular 
schools and school districts.  Guidance and assistance, not broad, 
heavy-handed mandates and regulations, should be the role of this 
division.</i>[29]

</blockquote>

<p>

<center><h3>Private Solutions</h3></center>

<p>

The federal lending program for post-secondary education should be 
privatized.  Government should concentrate its limited funds on 
"inherently governmental functions," insists Robert Poole, president 
of the Reason Foundation.   "It should separate policymaking and 
regulation from actual service delivery."[30]

<p>

The federal government entered the educational lending business in 
1972 when it chartered the Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie 
Mae) to ensure access to student loans for post-secondary education. 
Many argue that Sallie Mae has accomplished that mission and should 
now be privatized.[31] The Clinton Administration appears eager to 
let the quasi-private Sallie Mae do just that so that it may conduct 
a lending program with the exact opposite character: direct lending 
by the federal government.

<p>

Instituted in 1993, the Federal Direct Student Loan Program "has done 
nothing to 'reduce the complexity of administering student loans, 
eliminate unnecessary costs, and provide better service to students 
and schools'" as it claimed it would, according to Allyson Tucker of 
the Heritage Foundation.[32]

<p>

Robert Poole calls privatization "a major worldwide trend,"[33] yet our 
government has chosen to espouse the failed economic philosophy that 
government industries are preferable to private ones.  Bankers are 
doubtful that direct lending will succeed.[34] With the Education 
Department's history of students defaulting on loans, their pessimism 
is not unfounded.  The federal government should get out of the lending 
business; it should also get out of the educational research business.[35]

<p>

The federal government need not be involved for national educational 
research to take place.  Indeed, the most commonly cited measurement 
of student performance -- the Standard Achievement Test (SAT) -- comes 
not from the federal government but from the Educational Testing Service 
(ETS) in Princeton, NJ.

<p>

<center><h3>Conclusion</h3></center>

<p>

Bureaucracies are what bureaucracies do. Goals 2000 and the Elementary 
and Secondary Education Act clearly show the intent of the federal 
Education Department to intrude further into local schools and usurp 
community responsibility. The history standards that the Department 
financed are so biased that the United States Senate renounced them 
in a 99 to 1 vote.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

If there is one lesson of our times it is that centralization and huge 
bureaucracies don't work very well.  That truth swept away the 
governments of the Soviet Union and half a dozen other countries. 
People in all corners of the globe are moving to take control of their 
own lives back from distant bureaucracies.  Our own nation needs a 
renewal of the local spirit that Alexis de Tocqueville praised so 
highly in 1835:

<p>

<blockquote><i>

I know of no people who have established schools so numerous and 
efficacious, places of public worship better suited to the wants 
of the inhabitants, or roads kept in better repair.  Uniformity 
or permanence of design, the minute arrangement of details, and 
the perfection of administrative system must not be sought for in 
the United States; what we find there is the presence of a power 
which, if it is somewhat wild, is at least robust, and an existence 
checkered with accidents, indeed, but full of animation and effort.</i>[36]

</blockquote>

<p>

It's time to disestablish the U.S. Education Department and end 
the federal intrusion into America's schools.

<h3><i>Revolution Makers</i></h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
December 22, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<P>
Washington's big-government establishment was stunned in November 1994 when 
conservatives took over Congress. Their surprise, I think, is testimony not 
only to their arrogance -- but to their ignorance as well.
<p>
For years, liberals have dismissed conservatives as kooks, cranks and crazies. 
Rather than debate our ideas -- and defend their own -- they have preferred to 
rest on their (rapidly decaying) laurels. And while they were busy calling us 
names and ramming their costly utopian schemes down our throats -- schemes that 
didn't work, of course -- we were organizing, networking, writing, thinking, 
debating and refining our ideas and institutions.
<p>
A good example of the conservative movement's commitment to grassroots 
mobilization is the nation's oldest conservative lobbying organization, the <a 
href="/conservative/">American Conservative Union</a> (ACU) -- which recently 
celebrated its 30th anniversary.
<p>
The ACU started when Sen. Barry Goldwater lost to Lyndon Johnson in the 1964 
presidential race. Instead of knuckling under to what looked like a liberal 
tidal wave, a small group of concerned conservatives met to rally and 
re-energize. That core group formed the ACU, which now boasts a membership 
topping 1 million. The ACU was one of the first groups to encourage Ronald 
Reagan to seek the presidency in 1976. After Reagan announced he would run, the 
ACU began one of the first independent, non-party-affiliated campaigns on 
behalf of a presidential candidate. Since then, other grassroots organizations 
like the Christian Coalition and the Traditional Values Coalition have launched 
similar campaigns that have established indispensable networks of support for 
conservative ideas and candidates.
<p>
The ACU has kept busy, year in and year out, drumming up support for 
conservative causes such as a balanced budget, the creation of a national 
missile-defense system, curbing the growth of the federal bureaucracy, a 
free-market economy, a belief in limited government, a confidence in 
traditional moral values and a commitment to a strong national defense.
<p>
Today, the ACU is best known for its annual ranking of congressmen based on how 
they vote on a representative sample of key political issues. A good 
conservative ranking with the ACU is often touted in campaigns and worn as a 
badge of merit among members of Congress. Of course, a negative ACU ranking 
also has its uses ...
<p>
Groups like the ACU and <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a> have 
always stood up for the ideals that led the way to victory in 1994 and are 
still transforming Washington -- ideals the liberal left  still treats as "new" 
and unpalatable. And we are not alone in the struggle against the liberal 
establishment.
<p>
In 1995, a number of conservative organizations celebrated significant 
anniversaries, providing further evidence that the 1994 elections were no 
accident. <a href="/nationalreview/">National Review</a>, that lively "bible" 
of conservative opinion, reached a milestone: its 40th anniversary. With 
profound insight and humor, National Review and its founder and editor-at-large 
William F. Buckley Jr. have introduced several generations to an intellectual 
tradition based upon prudence, respect for the past, religious belief and 
common sense.
<p>
Commentary magazine, the important "neoconservative" monthly edited for 35 
years by Norman Podhoretz, observed its 50th anniversary just recenly. It 
remains an intellectual joy, hosting on its pages the incisive observations of 
America's best minds under Podhoretz's hand-chosen successor, Neal Kozodoy. 
Looking slightly ahead, Heritage will celebrate its 25th anniversary in 1998 -- 
just a neophyte in comparison to our colleagues. 
<p>
Prior to the 1994 elections, the left underestimated the intellectual vigor and 
tenacity of the conservative movement, and its ability to mobilize support. Not 
anymore. Liberals now realize we can win Washington back; or, if we have to, 
dig in for the long war and fight in the trenches until we get our next chance. 
Groups like the ACU have built this legacy.

<title>GAY 'MARRIAGE': HAWAII'S ASSAULT ON MATRIMONY</title>

<body>

<center>

<img src="/townhall/FRC/fampol/fampolbl.gif">

<h1>Gay 'Marriage'</h1>
<h2><i>Hawaii's Assault on Matrimony</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>T</font>he Hawaii Commission on Sexual Orientation 
recently voted 5-2 to recommend that same-sex couples be granted 
identical legal status now conferred on married couples.  The majority 
report declared that the denial of the &quot;benefits&quot; of marriage
&quot;purely on the basis of gender&quot; is a violation of &quot;basic
human rights&quot; enshrined in Hawaii's constitution.[1]

<p>

While the Commission's recommendation is non-binding, it
coincides with other pro-homosexual activity in the judicial and
executive branches of Hawaii's state government.  If these efforts
succeed, the institution of marriage will not only be affected
in America's 50th state, but in the other 49 as well.

<p>

In making its recommendation, a majority of the Hawaii Commission
on Sexual Orientation concluded that denial of marriage licenses
to same-sex couples deprived applicants of legal and economic
benefits, including:

<p><ol>

<li>joint parental custody;<br>
<li>insurance and health benefits;<br>
<li>the ability to file joint tax returns;<br>
<li>alimony and child support; and<br>
<li>inheritance of property and visitation of a partner or child in 
the hospital.

</ol><p>

The majority also concluded that legalization of same-sex
&quot;marriage&quot; would be an economic boon to Hawaii, as homosexuals
would flock there to get married.  (Apparently, they ignored the
possibility that traditional honeymooners may choose another destination,
and that more than 97 percent of the population is heterosexual.)

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Making gay 'marriage' legal would<br>
impose it on all the citizens of<br>
Hawaii, and perhaps even on people<br>
in the rest of the United States.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The Commission's minority report took issue with virtually
every assertion made by the majority, and cited medical, social,
historical and legal authorities to make the case that same-sex
&quot;marriage&quot; would encourage homosexuality and therefore
aggravate health problems associated with homosexual behavior,
hurt the island state economically because of possible boycotts,
and undermine the moral fabric of Hawaiian society.  The report
charged the majority with bullying witnesses, altering the official
record of meetings, rudely interrupting minority members and
generally suppressing information.

<p>

The minority concluded that granting marital status to homosexuals
would imperil marriage itself and bring Hawaii into conflict with
the other 49 states.  Its recommendations:

<p><ul><i>

<li>The Legislature should adopt a Constitutional Amendment
preserving marriage and the marital partnership as between one
man and one woman as husband and wife.

<p>

<li>The legal and economic benefits conferred on married couples
in the state of Hawaii should not be extended to homosexual and/or
&quot;common law marriage&quot; couples because the cost is too
great.

<p>

<li>The legal and economic benefits conferred on married couples
in the state of Hawaii should not be extended to homosexual couples
for all the same reasons these benefits are not extended to unmarried
heterosexual couples engaged in &quot;common law marriage&quot;
in Hawaii.

</ul>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b>
Other relationships have not been<br>
accorded the same status as marriage<br>
because they do not contribute in the<br>
same way to a community. No society<br>
can survive without marriages and<br>
families.
</b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<ul>

<li>Rather than extend marital benefits to homosexual couples,
the legislature should modify statutes defining family to include
all those who share a household, which would include homosexual
couples as families.  However, the cost of doing so must be analyzed.

<p>

<li>The legislature must create a very broad religious freedom
exemption covering religious institutions and individuals who
have religiously motivated objections to treating same-sex partnerships
as marriage-equivalents.

</i></ul><p>

The latter recommendations seem to be fall-back positions
in case the state goes ahead with some sort of change in family
status.  Recommendation &quot;D&quot; is an unwise move toward
redefinition of family, and is surprising in light of the minority's
conclusion that &quot;homosexuality is a psychological pathology
and should not be encouraged.&quot;[2]

<p>

Commissioner Lloyd James Hochberg, Jr., who voted in the
minority, told <i>The New York Times</i>, &quot;Why would we want
to take a pathological condition and make it the equivalent of
heterosexual marriage as a goal that society is teaching children?
Once homosexual marriage or domestic partnership is permitted,
the schools are going to have to teach that it's equivalent.&quot;[3]

<p>

<center><h3>Background</h3></center>

<p>

In May 1993, the Hawaiian Supreme Court ruled 3-1 in <i>Baehr
v. Lewin</i>[4] that the state's exclusion of same-sex couples from
marital status may be unconstitutional because it amounts to discrimination.
Two homosexual men had applied for a marriage license, were denied,
and then sued the state.  The case eventually made its way to
the state Supreme Court, which remanded it to a lower court with
instructions to the state to prove &quot;compelling state interests&quot;
for limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples.

<p>

The lower court is expected to rule on the case in July 1996.
If the State of Hawaii loses the case, and the court thereby
legalizes same-sex marriage, it can appeal to the state Supreme
Court. But that is unlikely because the governor and the lieutenant
governor are on record as favoring same-sex marriage and/or domestic
partnerships (legal equivalency of marriage without the term 
&quot;marriage&quot;).

<p>

In April 1994, the Hawaiian legislature overwhelmingly passed
a bill (21-4 in the Senate and 36-12 in the House) reaffirming
the traditional one-man, one-woman definition of marriage.  If
the lower court rules for same-sex marriage, it would strike down
this state law.  A likely reaction would be a voters' drive for
a constitutional amendment to replace the stricken statute.  Meanwhile,
other states are already moving to protect the traditional definition
of marriage.

<p>

<center><h3>Majority v. Minority Reports</h3></center>

<p>

The minority report begins with a wry observation:  &quot;The
irony of this 'minority' report is that its conclusions actually
reflect the view of a majority of Hawaii's residents.&quot;[5]
Indeed, a series of polls revealed that two-thirds of Hawaiians
disapprove of same-sex &quot;marriage.&quot;[6] Even so, many observers
expect the liberal Hawaiian courts to mandate gay &quot;marriage.&quot;

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Gay 'marriage' is an oxymoron, an<br>
ideological invention designed to<br>
appropriate the moral capital of<br>
marriage and family toward the goal<br>
of government-enforced acceptance of<br>
homosexuality. As such, the term is<br>
a counterfeit and a fraud.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Hawaii has earned a reputation for being on &quot;the cutting
edge&quot; of social experimentation.  It was the first state
to legalize abortion (1970), the first to ratify the Equal Rights
Amendment (1972) and the fifth to offer special employment protections
to homosexuals (1991).

<p>

The majority report, mimicking arguments used by homosexual
activists, compares the same-sex quest for marital status with
the civil rights struggle by black Americans.  Most prominently
cited is an interracial couple's victory in <i>Loving v. Virginia</i>.[7]
In that historic case, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down laws
preventing marriage between people of different races as violating
the equal protection and due process clauses of the Fourteenth
Amendment to the Constitution.

<p>

But the court never came close to redefining the institution
of marriage itself, which is what would have to occur for same-sex
relationships to be accorded marital status.  The false equation
of a benign, nonbehavioral characteristic such as skin color with
an orientation based precisely on behavior finds no support within
the law.  Perhaps it is no wonder that the majority equates all
sexual behavior.  At the very first meeting of the commission
the majority voted to ban all discussion of homosexuality because
some members might find it offensive or inflammatory.[8] Thus, the
truth about homosexual behavior was deliberately kept out of 
the proceedings.

<p>

The majority report also cites a number of flawed studies
to give the impression that homosexuality and heterosexuality
are essentially no different and have no implications for health
or for the well-being of children.  The report provides no medical
data to sustain its assertion that &quot;testimonies stating [that]
the extension of benefits to same-gender couples would threaten
public health are inaccurate.&quot;  The report also states that
&quot;there is no evidence that children of gay and lesbian parents
develop any differently than [sic] the children of opposite-sex
parents.&quot;[9] In making this point, the report ignores considerable
evidence that children are more likely to experiment with homosexuality
or identify as homosexuals when raised in a homosexual household.[10]

<p>

The majority expresses an odd understanding of the role of
morality and the law when it states, &quot;[W]hile each person
has the right to practice their individual religious and moral
beliefs, they do not have the right to impose those on others.&quot;[11]
Making gay &quot;marriage&quot; legal would impose it on all
the citizens of Hawaii, and perhaps even on people in the rest
of the United States.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Same-sex 'marriage' threatens not<br>
only the integrity of the marital<br>
definition but also religious freedom.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The majority goes on to state, &quot;Under our constitutional
government the fact that some religious [sic] or churches condemn
same-sex marriages does not mean that those religious beliefs
can be imposed on others.&quot;[12] In the very next paragraph, the
report notes, &quot;The Buddhists asked the Commission to support
stable relationships between loving people regardless of whether
those people are the same gender.&quot;[13] So, while saying that
no religion can impose its beliefs on others,  the report openly
and unselfconsciously adopts the Buddhist position.  Incidentally,
the commission itself was formed, then regrouped, only after two
representatives from the Catholic Church and two Mormons were expelled 
on grounds of &quot;separation of church and state.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>Societal Implications</h3></center>

<p>

In the 1970s, homosexuals unsuccessfully challenged marriage
laws in Minnesota, Kentucky and Washington state.  In the Minnesota
case, the state Supreme Court noted, &quot;The institution of
marriage as a union of man and woman, uniquely involving the procreating
and rearing of children within a family, is as old as the book
of Genesis....This historic institution is more deeply founded
than the asserted contemporary concept of marriage and societal
interests for which petitioners contend.&quot;[14]

<p>

Other relationships have not been accorded the same status
as marriage because they do not contribute in the same way to
a community. To put it bluntly, societies can get along quite
well -- in fact, better -- without same-sex sexual relationships,
but no society can survive without marriages and families.  In
fact, because the term &quot;heterosexual marriage&quot; is redundant,
the term &quot;marriage&quot; will mean in this essay what it
has always meant:  the social, legal and spiritual union of a
man and a woman.  &quot;Gay marriage&quot; is an oxymoron, an
ideological invention designed to appropriate the moral capital
of marriage and family toward the goal of government-enforced
acceptance of homosexuality. As such, the term &quot;gay marriage&quot;
is a counterfeit and a fraud.  It would undermine support for
marriage by ending marriage's unique legal and cultural status.
It would also undermine support for natural families, whose
foundation is marriage.

<p>

Same-sex &quot;marriage&quot; threatens not only the integrity
of the marital definition but also religious freedom.  Although
the majority report recommends that religious institutions not
be forced to perform same-sex ceremonies, it offers no defense
for the conscientious Christian, Jew or Muslim (or Hindu or atheist,
for that matter) who will not legally recognize same-sex 
&quot;marriage.&quot; Law carries the potential use of force against 
those who will not abide by it.  If a businessman declines to extend 
marital benefits to same-sex couples, the law would open him to lawsuits
and state coercion.  Schools would be forced to teach the acceptability
of gay &quot;marriage&quot; in family life courses.  Homosexuals'
efforts to adopt children would be made easier if marriage is
stripped of its unique status.

<p>

All institutions except specifically religious ones would
be subjected to state enforcement.  That would include Christian
bookstores, radio and TV stations, and other nondenominational
businesses owned by religious people.  And religious institutions
themselves may enjoy immunity only for a short time.  &quot;Religious
exemption&quot; implies that the policy itself is at odds with
the moral order, but when push comes to shove, the state often
prevails.  For example, the Supreme Court swept away Bob Jones
University's tax-exempt status because the college, citing religious
reasons,  prohibited interracial dating.  The justices said that
the state's compelling interest in ensuring equality overrode
the college's religious views.  Almost all Christians would view
the university's stance as unbiblical, but the point is that religious
freedom is at the sufferance of the courts, which are acting increasingly
like lawmakers instead of law interpreters.  Religious freedom
can be curtailed anytime a court decides the state wants to do
so for &quot;compelling&quot; reasons.  Religious exemptions,
therefore, are most likely a temporary step on the way to total
acceptance of homosexuality.

<p>

<center><h3>Other States Fight Back</h3></center>

<p>

A constitutional conflict looms should the Hawaii court legalize
gay &quot;marriage,&quot; because under the U.S. Constitution's
full faith and credit clause, states must accord reciprocity to
other states in such matters as marriage and drivers' licenses.
So, theoretically, a homosexual couple could marry in Honolulu,
move to California and demand that the Golden State recognize
their &quot;marriage.&quot;  Because states do vary in their marital
requirements (such as minimum age), the general rule has been
to apply the law of the state where the marriage was performed
to determine a marriage's validity,  unless it &quot;violates
the strong public policy&quot; of the state in which the couple
reside.[15]

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Observers in some states have already moved to bolster this
common law protection by making the point more explicitly.

<p><ul>

<li>In March, 1995, Utah's legislators voted to deny recognition
of any out-of-state marriages that do not conform to Utah law.

<p>

<li>In South Dakota, a similar bill (H1184) passed the House
of Representatives but failed by one vote to get on the Senate
calendar.

<p>

<li>In Alaska, a bill was introduced in early 1995 to make clear
that &quot;marriage is a civil contract entered into by one man
and one woman.&quot;

<p>

<li>In Minnesota in 1993, a bill (H3016) which specified that
&quot;a marriage contracted between persons of the same gender
and recognized as valid in another state is not valid in this
state&quot; failed in a House committee.

<p>

<li>In New Hampshire in 1994, a bill (SB557) failed in a Senate
committee that would have barred recognition of  marriage &quot;between
persons of the same gender.&quot;  Even this might have proved
ineffective given the ongoing drive by feminists at United Nations-sponsored
conferences on women to redefine gender into no less than five
categories (male heterosexual, female heterosexual, male homosexual,
female homosexual and transsexual/bisexual).

<p>

<li>In early 1996, marriage protection bills were introduced in several 
state legislatures, including California, Idaho and Washington. 
Legislators in other states, such as Alabama, Virginia and Georgia, 
were preparing bills.

</ul><p>

<center><h3>The Importance of Definition</h3></center>

<p>

In all cultural struggles, a primary battleground is the
use of language.  Compromising the integrity of a term or phrase
can advance a particular agenda, or, at least, sow confusion
and uncertainty.  A term such as &quot;marriage&quot; can either
lose the power of its original meaning or be commandeered to mean
something entirely different.  In 1828, Noah Webster defined 
&quot;marriage&quot; as:

<p><blockquote>

<i>The act of uniting a man and woman for life; wedlock;  the
legal union of a man and woman for life.  Marriage is a contract
both civil and religious, by which the parties engage to live
together in mutual affection and fidelity, till death shall separate
them.  Marriage was instituted by God himself for the purpose
of preventing the promiscuous intercourse of the sexes, for domestic
felicity, and for securing the maintenance and education of children.
&quot;Marriage is honorable in all and the bed undefiled.
Heb. xiii.&quot;</i>[16]

</blockquote>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
One can no more 'expand' a definition<br>
or moral principle than one can<br>
continually expand a yardstick and<br>
still use it as a reliable measure.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

A more recent (1981) <i>Webster's</i> definition retains
the essential elements of the earlier version:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Marriage\ a: the state of being united to a person of the opposite
sex as husband or wife b: the mutual relation of husband and wife:
wedlock c: the institution whereby men and women are joined in
a special kind of social and legal dependence for the purpose
of founding and maintaining a family.</i>[17]

</blockquote><p>

No jurisdictional unit in the United States -- town, city,
or state -- recognizes same-sex couples as &quot;married.&quot;
In 1975, Boulder, Colorado granted a marriage license to a same-sex
couple, but it was struck down by a federal court in 1982. Protections
favoring marriage are built into the law and the culture because
of the central importance of the family unit as the building block
of civilization.  In 1888, the U.S. Supreme Court described marriage
&quot;as creating the most important relation in life, as having
more to do with the morals and civilization of a people than any
other institution.&quot;[18]

<p>

However, some jurisdictions are moving toward redefining
the family to include same-sex relationships, and there is a movement
within the legal community to overhaul the definitions of marriage
and family.  A note in the <I>Harvard Law Review</I> in 1991 advocated
replacing the formal definition of family with an elastic standard
based &quot;mainly on the strength or duration of emotional bonds,&quot;
regardless of sexual orientation.  The note recommends redefining
the family through &quot;domestic partner&quot; or family 
&quot;registration&quot; statutes that go beyond the limited benefits now 
conferred by existing domestic partnership laws so as to &quot;achieve 
parity&quot; between marriage and other relationships.[19]

<p>

In 1990, San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos appointed lesbian
activist Roberta Achtenberg (later Assistant Secretary of the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development under President
Clinton) to chair the Mayor's Task Force on Family Policy.  The
final report of the task force defines the family this way:

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;A unit of interdependent and interacting persons, related
together over time by strong social and emotional bonds and/or
by ties of marriage, birth, and adoption, whose central purpose
is to create, maintain, and promote the social, mental, physical
and emotional development and well being of each of its 
members.&quot;</i>[20]

</blockquote>

excluded, nor any imaginable<br>

point is to demote marriage to a<br>
level with all other relationships.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

In this definition, which could reasonably be described as
a formulation by homosexual activists, marriage is no longer the
foundation for families but secondary to &quot;strong social and
emotional bonds.&quot;  This definition is so vague that multiple-partner
unions are not excluded, nor any imaginable combination of persons,
including a fishing boat crew.  The whole point is to demote marriage
to a level with all other relationships.

<p>

To place same-sex relationships on a par with marriage destroys
the definition of marriage altogether.  When the meaning of a
word becomes nonspecific, the exclusivity that it previously defined
is lost.  For instance, if the state of Hawaii decided to extend
the famous -- and exclusive -- &quot;Maui onion&quot; appellation
to all onions grown in Hawaii -- even on, say, Oahu --, the term
&quot;Maui onion&quot; would lose its original meaning.  Consumers
would lack confidence in buying a bag of &quot;Maui onions&quot;
if all onions could be labeled as such.  The same goes for any
brand name. Wine from California could be falsely labeled as wine
from Bordeaux, France, thus destroying the uniqueness of both
appellations.  If &quot;marriage&quot; in Hawaii ceases to be
the term used solely for the social, legal, economic and spiritual
bonding of a man and a woman, the term &quot;marriage&quot; becomes
useless.

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

A key point to remember is that no one of marriageable age
is prevented from marrying in Hawaii provided they don't marry
blood relatives, underage persons, nonhumans or more than one
person.  Homosexuals are not denied the right to marry; but they
have to fulfill the requirements like anyone else.  They cannot
call a same-sex relationship &quot;marriage,&quot; since it lacks
a basic ingredient -- an entire sex.  The joining of the two opposite
sexes in permanence is the very essence of marriage.  Once the
&quot;one man, one woman&quot; definition is abandoned, there
is no logical reason for limiting &quot;marriage&quot; to two
people or even to people.  Why not have three partners?  Or why
not a man and his daughter?  Or a man and his dog?  The logical
reason to extend &quot;marriage&quot; to homosexual couples has
nothing to do with marital integrity, but only reflects the fact
that homosexuals want the same status regardless of its real meaning.
Anything less, they say, is a denial of human rights.  If so,
then a threesome or a foursome seeking marital status can similarly
claim that their sexual proclivities must be recognized by society
and the law as the equal of marriage or they are facing discrimination.

<p>

<center><h3>The Real Agenda</h3></center>

<p>

Homosexual activist Tom Stoddard acknowledges that &quot;enlarging
the concept to embrace same-sex couples would necessarily transform
it into something new....Extending the right to marry to gay people
-- that is, abolishing the traditional gender requirements of
marriage -- can be one of the means, perhaps the principal one,
through which the institution divests itself of the sexist trappings
of the past.&quot;[21] In other words, while many homosexual spokesmen
say they want only to be left alone to enjoy the benefits of marriage,
Stoddard rightly sees the expanded definition as a way of attacking
the institution itself.

<p>

In 1992, organizers of the homosexuals' 1993 March on Washington
met in Texas to draft a platform of demands.  Known as &quot;the
Texas platform,&quot; it was later toned down to make it more
palatable to a mass audience.  The original section on &quot;family,&quot;
however, is revealing as to the intentions of the movement.  In
addition to Demand No. 40, &quot;the recognition and legal protection
of all forms of family structures,&quot; the writers make Demand
No. 45, &quot;legalization of same-sex marriages,&quot; and Demand
No. 46, &quot;legalization of multiple partner unions.&quot;[22]

An English study also published<br>
in the journal</i> AIDS <i>found that<br>
most 'unsafe' sex acts occur in<br>
steady relationships.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

An enormous body of research indicates that monogamy is not the
norm for the average homosexual.[23] But even when it is, the result
is not necessarily healthier behavior.  A study published in the
journal <I>AIDS</I> found that men in steady relationships practiced
more anal intercourse and oral-anal intercourse than those without
a steady partner.[24] In other words, the exclusivity of the relationship
did not diminish the incidence of unhealthy behavior that is the
essence of homosexual sexual activity.  Curbing promiscuity would
help curb the spread of AIDS and the many other sexually transmitted
diseases that are found disproportionately among homosexuals,
but there is little evidence that &quot;monogamous&quot; homosexual
relationships function that way.  An English study also published
in the journal <I>AIDS</I> found that most &quot;unsafe&quot;
sex acts occur in steady relationships.[25]

<p>

Former homosexual William Aaron explains why &quot;monogamy&quot;
has a different meaning among homosexuals:  &quot;In the gay life,
fidelity is almost impossible.  Since part of the compulsion of
homosexuality seems to be a need on the part of the homophile
to 'absorb' masculinity from his sexual partners, he must be constantly
on the lookout for [new partners].  Consequently the most successful
homophile 'marriages' are those where there is an arrangement
between the two to have affairs on the side while maintaining
the semblance of permanence in their living arrangement.&quot;[26]

<p>

<center><h3>Sexual Revolution: A War on Families</h3></center>

<p>

As the research of the late Harvard sociologist Pitirim Sorokin
reveals, no society has loosened sexual morality outside of marriage
and survived.  Analyzing studies of cultures spanning several
thousand years on several continents, Sorokin found that virtually
all political revolutions that brought about societal collapse
were preceded by sexual revolutions in which marriage and family
were no longer accorded premiere status.[27] To put it another way,
as marriage and family ties disintegrated, the social restraints
learned in families also disintegrated. Societal chaos ushers
in tyrants who promise to restore order by any means.

<p>

Self-governing people require a robust culture founded on
marriage and family, which nurture the qualities that permit self-rule:
deferred gratification, self-sacrifice, respect for kinship and
law, and property rights.  These qualities are founded upon sexual
restraint, which permits people to pursue long-term interests,
such as procreating and raising the next generation, and securing
benefits for one's children.

<p>

In the 1981 Apostolic Exhortation <I>Familiaris Consortio</I>,
John Paul II summarized the importance of marriage-based families
this way:

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;The family has vital and organic links with society since
it is its foundation and nourishes it continually through its
role of service to life:  It is from the family that citizens
come to birth and it is within the family that they find the first
school of the social virtues that are the animating principle
of the existence and development of society itself.&quot;</i>[28]

</blockquote><p>

According sex outside marriage the same protections and status
as the marital bond would destroy traditional sexual morality,
not expand it.  One can no more &quot;expand&quot; a definition
or moral principle than one can continually expand a yardstick
and still use it as a reliable measure.[29]

<p>

Marriage-based kinship is essential to stability and continuity.
A man is more apt to sacrifice himself to help a son-in-law than
some unrelated man (or woman) living with his daughter. Kinship
entails mutual obligations and a commitment to the future of the
community. Homosexual relationships are a negation of the ties
that bind -- the continuation of kinship through procreation of
children.  To accord same-sex relationships the same status as
a marriage is to accord them a value that they cannot possibly
have.  Marriages benefit more than the two people involved, or
even the children that are created.  Their influence reaches children
living nearby, as young minds seek out role models. The stability
they bring to a community benefits all.

<center><h3>Conclusion</h3></center>

<p>

Some people in Hawaii are beginning the process of fashioning
a constitutional amendment to protect their state's law on marriage,
should the courts radically redefine it.  Other states are taking
action to defend their laws regarding marriage.   If more states
strengthen their laws, they would also strengthen the marriage
defenders in Hawaii, who can cite the &quot;compelling state interest&quot;
of heading off a constitutional crisis. At the federal level,
Congress may well consider legislation mandating the one-man,
one-woman definition of marriage for all federal purposes, including
the military, federal benefits, federal agency employment policies,
and the law in federal territories such as Puerto Rico and Guam.

<title>PARENTAL RIGHTS: WHO DECIDES HOW CHILDREN ARE RAISED?</title>

<body>

<center>

<img src="/townhall/FRC/fampol/fampolbl.gif">

<h1>Parental Rights:</h1>
<h2><i>Who Decides How Children Are Raised?</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>F</font>rom ancient times to modernity, political philosophy 
has grappled with the sensitive relationship between the child, family, 
and state.  In <I>The Republic</I>, Plato wrote:

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;The wives of our guardians are to be common, and their
children are to be common, and no parent is to know his own child,
nor any child his parent. . . .  The proper officers will take
the offspring of the good parents to the pen or fold, and there
they will deposit them with certain nurses who dwell in a separate
quarter.&quot;</i>

</blockquote><p>

In <I>Orthodoxy</I>, G.K. Chesterton observed:

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;In short, the democratic faith is this:  that the
most terribly important things must be left to ordinary men themselves
-- the mating of the sexes, the rearing of the young, the laws
of the state.&quot;</i>

</blockquote><p>

Like Plato, modern-day utopian thinkers and totalitarian
states have always looked upon the parent-child relationship with
suspicion at best, and more often as the crucial obstacle to ultimate
state power over the individual.  For even if the state is successful
in dissolving all other institutions which mediate between the
individual and state, such as local government, the church, and
private associations, it must still contend with the family unit
as the last bastion of organic relationships from which spring
an individual's prior loyalties.  Because a totalitarian regime
can admit of no prior loyalties, ultimately the natural bonds
between husband and wife, and parent and child must also be dissolved,
reducing even children to the status of atomized individuals,
helpless before the Leviathan.

<font size=+1><b><i>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Conversely, as Chesterton so eloquently expressed, respect
for the autonomy of the family is as central to the democratic
ideal as popular sovereignty.  The democratic experiment is founded
on an optimism in the ability of the people to manage their own
affairs, in their capacity as citizens with authority over &quot;the
laws of the state,&quot; and in their capacity as parents with
authority over &quot;the rearing of the young.&quot;  Therefore,
restoring parental rights to its original firm foundation in U.S.
constitutional law is crucial to our overall efforts to reinvigorate
the democratic ideal of citizenship.

<p>

<center><h3>The Constitutional Roots of Parental Rights</h3></center>

<p>

Parental liberty as a fundamental right found a secure place
in U.S. constitutional jurisprudence beginning with two Supreme
Court cases from the 1920s.  The 1923 decision in <I>Meyer v.
Nebraska</I>[1] involved a challenge to a Nebraska state law which
prohibited the teaching of foreign languages in any school --
public or private -- prior to the eighth grade.  In determining
whether or not the foreign-language prohibition unreasonably infringed
upon family rights,[2] the Supreme Court declared that the 14th Amendment
liberty interest &quot;[w]ithout doubt, [] denotes not merely
freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual
to contract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life,
to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, establish a home and bring
up children.&quot;[3] The Court held that the Nebraska statute interfered
with the parents' fundamental right to raise their children, including
the right to have their children learn a foreign language.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<font size=+1><b><i>
With the parental<br>
responsibility to protect<br>
their children from harm<br>
comes the parental right<br>
to direct their children's<br>
upbringing and education.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Two years later, in <I>Pierce v. Society of Sisters,</I>[4] the
Court examined an Oregon state statute compelling parents to send
their children to public schools from ages 8 to 16 -- essentially
banning private education.[5]  While acknowledging that the State
has the authority to enact reasonable regulations to ensure the
basic education of the citizenry,[6] the Court held that in this
instance state authority must yield to the rights of parents.
&quot;Under the doctrine of <I>Meyer v. Nebraska</I>, we think
it entirely plain that the [Oregon state] Act of 1922 unreasonably
interferes with the liberty of parents and guardians to direct
the upbringing and education of children under their control&quot;[7]
(citations omitted). The Court stated:

<p><blockquote>

<i>The fundamental theory of liberty upon which all governments
in this Union repose excludes any general power of the State to
standardize its children by forcing them to accept instruction
from public teachers only.  The child is not the mere creature
of the State; those who nurture him and direct his destiny have
the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare
him for additional obligations.</i>[8]

</blockquote><p>

A generation passed before the high court issued another landmark
parental rights decision, <I>Prince v. Massachusetts</I>.[9] The
Court ruled in favor of state authority over the asserted parental
right of Sarah Prince, a Jehovah's Witness.  Prince was the guardian
of a 9-year-old girl whom she took with her to sell religious
pamphlets on the street.  When charged with violating state child
labor laws, Prince claimed that the law violated her religious
freedom and parental rights.  The Court, citing <I>Pierce</I>,
acknowledged parental rights in the strongest terms:

<p><blockquote>

<i>It is cardinal with us that the custody, care and nurture
of the child reside first in the parents, whose primary function
and freedom include preparation for obligations the state can
neither supply nor hinder.  And it is in recognition of this that
these decisions have respected the private realm of family life
which the state cannot enter&quot; (citations omitted).</i>[10]

</blockquote><p>

Despite this reaffirmation, the Court recognized that the state
may act to protect children by &quot;limiting parental freedom
and authority in things affecting the child's welfare&quot;[11] 
including protecting the child from &quot;the crippling effects of 
child employment,&quot; especially in public places.[12]

<p>

In 1972, the Supreme Court again considered a case involving
overlapping issues of parental rights and religious freedom.
In <I>Wisconsin v. Yoder</I>,[13] Amish families desired to remove
their children from school after the eighth grade, violating Wisconsin's
compulsory education law.[14] The Court declared:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Indeed it seems clear that if the State is empowered, as</I> 
parens patriae, <I>to &quot;save&quot; a child from himself
or his Amish parents by requiring an additional two years of compulsory
formal high school education, the State will in large measure
influence, if not determine, the religious future of the child.
Even more markedly than in Prince, therefore, this case involves
the fundamental interest of parents, as contrasted with that of
the State, to guide the religious future and education of their
children.</i>[15]

</blockquote><p>

While recognizing the State's &quot;high responsibility for
education of its citizens,&quot;[16] the Court concluded that this
interest did not outweigh the Amish parents' religious beliefs
and parent liberty interest in directing the education of their
children.[17]

<p>

<center><h3>The Modern Assault on Parental Rights</h3></center>

<p>

The state laws overturned by the high court in <I>Meyer</I>
and <I>Pierce</I> were generated by racial and religious tensions
typical of the 1920s (<I>Meyer</I> dealt with anti-German sentiment
following World War I, and <I>Pierce</I>, the anti-Catholicism
of the age).  Recent conflicts between parents and the state involve
a broad range of matters at the very heart of the parent-child
relationship.  The growing parental backlash against schools and
other government bureaucracies is best understood as part of the
overall struggle parents face as they attempt to transmit their
most cherished beliefs to their children in the midst of an anti-family
culture.

<p>

Many social commentators have focused attention on our degraded
popular culture, and it is widely recognized that parents face
an increasingly difficult task in monitoring their children's
exposure to the barrage of harmful images produced by Hollywood,
pop music, and the Internet.  But while a national debate rages
over the proper response to the polluted commercial marketplace,
relatively little attention has been focused on the fact that
too often parents have discovered that their own <I>government</I>
is part of the problem.  Increasingly, parents are demanding that
government policies support, rather than undermine, their authority.

<p>

The past generation has witnessed the growth of  two overlapping
trends in public policy which have significantly undermined parental
authority and family autonomy.  The first is exemplified by laws
giving minors access to abortion and birth control without parental
approval, and in looming threats like the U.N. Convention on the
Rights of the Child.[18] Implicit in these policies is an assumption
that children should be treated as &quot;short adults,&quot; i.e.,
as autonomous individuals, fully capable of making crucial decisions
about their upbringing, and legally entitled to make these decisions
outside the context of their family.  The second trend involves
the state's increasing propensity to substitute its judgment for
that of parents in matters relating to the upbringing and education
of children.

<p>

These trends run counter to the longstanding philosophical
and legal understanding  that with the parental responsibility
to <I>protect</I> their children from harm comes the parental
right to <I>direct</I> their children's upbringing and education.
But in cases where the state allows minors access to the full
range of choices formerly reserved for adults, parents are effectively
prevented from fulfilling their role as protector.  When the state
substitutes its judgment for that of parents by actually making
the choice for the minor, parental responsibility to guide their
children's choices is usurped.

<p>

<center><h3>'Short Adults'</h3></center>

<p>

Historically, the majority of our laws regulating minors' choices
have been of a protective nature.  For example, adults many not
enter into binding contracts with unemancipated minors, on the
assumption that a child should not be legally bound to fulfill
a contract between parties of such unequal bargaining power and
capacity.  Adults are also prohibited from selling alcohol, tobacco,
and pornography to children.  Abuse laws protect children if the
threat comes from within the family.  The law steps in to protect
the child from being harmed by a more powerful agent.

<p>

While it is indisputable that children have rights, parents
traditionally have been considered the proper custodians of these
rights until their children reach adulthood.  &quot;The presumptions
arising from the limited capacities of children account, in large
part, for their general limitation on the exercise of 'choice'
rights.  The law, and traditionally the culture, has assumed that
a basic capacity to make responsible choices is a prerequisite
to meaningful exercise of such rights.&quot;[19]

The so-called 'children's<br>
rights' movement threatens<br>
to destroy a child's most<br>
precious right: the right<br>
to childhood innocence.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The 1967 case of <I>In re Gault</I>[20] marked the Supreme Court's
first unequivocal ruling that children have constitutional rights.
While <I>Gault</I> involved juvenile court delinquency proceedings,
the Court's reasoning has far broader implications for the general
liberty of children.  Courts have begun to grant children &quot;choice&quot;
rights like adults in select areas, most notably, by guaranteeing
access to birth control and abortion.[21] This has served as a compelling
precedent for other state policies which prevent parents from
controlling minor's choice rights.

<p>

The movement to grant minors full access to the full range
of choices available to adults naturally leads to liberation of
children from their parents, who serve as an obstacle to the free
exercise of these new rights.  But in a tragic irony, the so-called
&quot;children's rights&quot; movement threatens to destroy a
child's most precious right:  the right to childhood innocence.
A startling example of this phenomenon can be found in local
public libraries.  The American Library Association is formally
opposed to any restrictions on a child's ability to check out
any item, no matter how pornographic or inappropriate for children,
regardless of parental objections.[22] The ALA has gone so far as
to refuse to let parents view the check-out records of their minor
children on grounds that such action would violate the child's
privacy rights.[23] The emotional and moral health of children is
thus sacrificed on the altar of &quot;intellectual freedom,&quot;
and parents are again prevented from fulfilling their responsibility
to protect the child.

<p>

The &quot;children's rights&quot; agenda perhaps is best embodied
in the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child,[24] an international
treaty adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in 1989.  According
to the United Nation's Children's Fund (UNICEF), the Convention
&quot;defines the minimum standards for civil, economic, social,
cultural, and political rights of children.&quot;[25] Ratifying nations
are called to guarantee a host of rights to children, including
&quot;the right to freedom of expression; . . . regardless of
frontiers,&quot; and the right &quot;to freedom of thought, conscience
and religion.&quot;[26]

<p>

More than 170 countries have ratified the Convention.  In February
1995, President Bill Clinton sent the treaty to the U.S. Senate
for possible ratification, where it is currently pending.  The
U.S. Constitution declares that international treaties ratified
by the U.S. become the &quot;supreme Law of the Land.&quot;[27] Therefore,
the U.N. Convention raises serious questions as to its implications
for parental rights in the U.S.  Are these &quot;children's rights&quot;
intended to be legally enforceable over and against the rights
and responsibilities of parents? What might be the scope of a
child's right, for example, to &quot;freedom of expression?&quot;[28]

<p>

<center><h3>Substituted Judgment</h3></center>

<p>

Competing interests of the family and state most frequently
meet in the public school arena.  Schools traditionally have functioned
<I>in loco parentis, i.e.,</I> in place of parents. This
implies that parents have delegated partial authority to the school.
But when school officials contradict the will or values of parents,
they exceed their delegated authority and substitute their judgment
for that of the parents.  Several recent examples from around
the country highlight the increasingly brazen tendency toward
substituted judgment in the public schools.

<p>

On March 19, 1996, 59 sixth-grade girls from the J.T. Lambert
Intermediate School in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, were taken
to the school nurse's office where they were required to remove
their clothes and submit to a genital examination as part of a
&quot;routine&quot; physical.  While Pennsylvania state law allows
for physical examinations at elementary schools, the East Stroudsburg
parents quite naturally did not expect such an examination to
include intrusive vaginal exams.

<p>

One family was horrified to learn that their daughter had been
forced to undergo the exam despite the fact that they had already
taken the option of submitting an exam report from their own doctor.
Their daughter reported that she had told the school official
in charge that her report was on file, but the official said
that the school had lost the report and that the girl had no choice
but to have the exam.  The girl began to cry and plead with the
school officials to use the phone to call her mother.  But she
was prohibited from calling her mother, and the school nurse stood
in front of the door, blocking the exit.  After submitting to
the exam, she came home in tears, physically and emotionally hurt.[29]

<p>

When questioned, the school initially denied that the girls
had been touched at all.  The school then abruptly changed its
position and admitted that gynecological exams had been conducted
on these 11-year-olds to check for sexually-transmitted diseases
and sexual abuse, even though no incident of disease or abuse
had been indicated.  At the time of this writing, several families
had filed suit against the school, which continues to defend its
action.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Unfortunately, the outrage of East Stroudsburg is not an isolated
case.  In Stephens County, Georgia, Sharon and Waymon Earls were
shocked to discover that their 14- and 15-year-old daughters had
been driven to a birth control clinic by a public school staffer
without their knowledge.  The county clinic dispensed birth control
pills and condoms to the girls and administered Pap smears and
AIDS tests.  Mr. and Mrs. Earls were then denied access to the
test results by the school, which defended its actions on the
grounds that the counselor believed she was doing what was best
for the girls.  The counselor's husband, Stephens County School
Superintendent Ed Mills, admitted that his wife had driven many
other girls to the clinic over the years.[30]

<p>

Public schools are also increasingly adopting policies whereby
an entire class is subjected to mandatory psychological testing
or explicit sex education which contradicts the values taught
at home.  Psychological testing of children is often performed
under the guise of standardized tests which include intrusive
questions about the child's emotional state and sexual experiences,
the child's relationship with his or her parents, and values and
habits within the home.

<p>

For example, a 149-question survey used in Minnesota public
schools without parental approval contains questions such as:

<p><ul>

<li><i>Have you ever tried to kill yourself?

<br>

<li>How often have you run away from home?

<br>

<li>Have you felt so discouraged or hopeless that you wondered
if anything was worthwhile?</i>[31]

</ul><p>

In California, in 1994, a statewide controversy erupted over
one such test known as the California Learning Assessment System
(CLAS), a mandatory, standardized test administered to over a
million public school students.  After rumors began circulating
among parents regarding the intrusive nature of some of the questions,
the public school bureaucracy added insult to injury by refusing
to let parents even see the CLAS test their children would be
required to take.[32]

<p>

Parents who have challenged intrusive government policies in
court have met with decidedly mixed results.  Three high-profile
cases recently rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court serve as a disheartening
barometer of the status of parental rights.

<p>

<i><b>Newkirk v. Lansing:</b></i>[33]

<p>

During the 1989-1990 school
year, Daniel and Nancy Newkirk from East Lansing, Michigan, discovered
that their 8-year-old son Jason was being psychologically counseled
by an unlicensed, untrained guidance counselor against their express
wishes.  The case began when Jason's teacher told the Newkirks
that their son wasn't &quot;interacting&quot; with classmates
as she thought he should.  The parents agreed to let their son
&quot;play games&quot; (like checkers) with the guidance counselor,
but flatly refused to allow any psychological counseling.

<p>

Despite this apparent understanding, the counselor began subjecting
Jason to &quot;The Talking, Feeling, and Doing Game, a Psychotherapeutic
Game for Children.&quot;  While the manufacturer of this game
warns that it is intended for use &quot;only by mental health
professionals,&quot; the counselor had no such training.

<p>

Questions posed to young Jason from the game included:

<p><ul>

<li><i>Tell something about your mother that gets you angry.

<br>

<li>What do you think about a boy who sometimes wished that
his brother were dead?

<br>

<li>What is the worst thing you can say about your family?</i>[34]

</ul><p>

After the counseling began, the Newkirks noticed changes in
their son's attitude, and he began complaining to his parents
about his sessions with the counselor.  The Newkirks' confronted
the school, but were told that the relationship between the boy
and the counselor was &quot;confidential.&quot;  They then had
a psychiatrist examine Jason, who diagnosed the boy as having
suffered emotional damage from the sessions, including separation
anxiety disorder and panic attacks.

<p>

The Newkirks filed suit in July 1991 in U.S. District Court
against the school district and some of the school staff involved.
In March 1993, the U.S. District Court ruled against the parents.
On appeal, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this ruling,
and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to review the case,
leaving the Newkirks with no further remedy.

<p>

<i><b>Brown v. Hot, Sexy and Safer Productions:</b></i>[35]

<p>

In 1992, students in a Chelmsford, Massachusetts public high
school were compelled to attend a sex education seminar by Suzi
Landolph entitled &quot;Hot, Sexy, and Safer.&quot;  A transcript
of Ms. Landolph's performance in Chelmsford reveals that it included
simulated masturbation, crude language, and condom licking.  Chelmsford
parents were given neither advance notice nor a chance to remove
their children from the seminar.

<p>

Ronald and Suzanne Brown and other Chelmsford parents filed
suit, alleging that the school's &quot;opt-out&quot; policy was
not followed.  The parents lost their case before the First Circuit
Court of Appeals in Massachusetts, and in March 1996 the U.S.
Supreme Court declined to review another major parental rights
case, allowing the lower court decision against the parents to
stand.

<p>

<i><b>Curtis v. School Comm. of Falmouth:</b></i>[36]

<p>

Elizabeth Curtis and other parents from Falmouth, Massachusetts, filed 
suit in 1992 against their school board's installation of condom vending
machines in their high schools.  Moreover, according to school
board policy, school nurses were to give condoms upon request
to children as young as 11 in the junior high schools, notwithstanding
the written objections of their parents.  The County Superior
Court refused to grant a parental &quot;opt-out&quot; of the condom
program, and an appeal was rejected by the Massachusetts Supreme
Court in July 1995.  In January 1996, Bay State parents suffered
another loss when the U.S. Supreme Court refused without comment
to hear their appeal, further undermining parental rights in the
state of Massachusetts.[37]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The Massachusetts Supreme Court maintained that because the
condom program was not &quot;coercive,&quot; the school was not
usurping parental rights:

<p><blockquote>

<i>[T]he students are free to decline to participate in the
program. . . . For their part, the plaintiffs are free to instruct
their children not to participate. . . . Although exposure to
condom vending machines and to the program itself may offend the
moral and religious sensibilities of the plaintiffs, mere exposure
to programs offered at school does not amount to unconstitutional
interference with parental liberties without the existence of
some compulsory aspects to the program.</i>[38]

</blockquote><p>

This passage from <I>Curtis</I> reveals how treating minors
as &quot;short adults&quot; works in tandem with state-substituted
judgment to undermine parental authority.  First, we are told
that the condom program is &quot;voluntary&quot; because the <I>students</I>
&quot;are free to decline to participate,&quot; <I>i.e.</I>, they
are autonomous actors capable of making their own decisions about
choices presented to them at school.  The school maintains a facade
of neutrality with regard to the choice presented, but by presenting
to the child extra-curricular options that starkly contradict
the values of the parent, the state is assisting the child in
circumventing the parent's will.

<p>

<center><h3>Reaffirming Parental Rights</h3></center>

<p>

Until recently, the primary battleground in the struggle to
preserve parental rights has been the state and federal court
system.  While individual families continue to press their case
in courts around the country, it has become increasingly clear
that parents need legislative remedies.  As a result, the parental
rights movement has become proactive, inspiring the introduction
of legislation designed to guarantee parental rights at the state
and federal levels.

<p>

In its most common form, the Parental Rights Amendment reads:
<I>&quot;The right of parents to direct the upbringing and education
of their children shall not be infringed.&quot;</I> By codifying
language taken directly from the 1925 <I>Pierce</I> case, the
Amendment would provide parents with an explicit right grounded
in their state constitution.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
The federal parental<br>
rights legislation is<br>
a negative mandate on<br>
government. It checks<br>
power, not enhances it.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

A statute designed to protect parental rights has also been
introduced in Congress.  In the fall of 1995, Sen. Charles Grassley
(R-Iowa) and Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) introduced the &quot;Parental
Rights and Responsibilities Act&quot; (PRRA).  The PRRA would
protect parental rights, including directing or providing for
the education of the child; making a health or mental health care
decision for the child; disciplining the child, including reasonable
corporal discipline; and directing or providing for the religious
teaching of the child. The PRRA would clarify the fundamental
nature of parental rights, thus providing much-needed direction
to federal and lower courts.

<p>

The high court in <I>Meyer</I> and <I>Pierce</I> established
that parental rights are fundamental under the liberty interest
of the Fifth and 14th Amendments to the Constitution.  The state
may not infringe a fundamental right without having a compelling
reason to do so.

<p>

In several important cases, however, lower courts have begun
to consider parental rights as less than fundamental, allowing
the state to demonstrate merely a &quot;rational basis&quot; for
infringing the right -- a much lower hurdle to clear.[39] By declining
to review lower court decisions in cases such as <I>Newkirk v.
Lansing, Brown v. Hot, Sexy, and Safer,</I> and <I>Curtis v. Falmouth</I>
-- each of which treated parental rights as less than fundamental
-- the Supreme Court has allowed the rights it enunciated long
ago in <I>Meyer</I> and <I>Pierce</I> to die the proverbial &quot;death
of a thousand cuts.&quot; 

<p>

The PRRA would codify the Supreme Court's longstanding interpretation
of parental rights as a fundamental liberty interest, and would
instruct federal and lower courts to employ the &quot;compelling
interest&quot; test when considering parental rights cases.

<p>

Some have claimed that the Parental Rights and Responsibilities
Act raises federalism concerns.  But by virtue of the rulings
in <I>Meyer, Pierce, Yoder</I> and others, the federal government,
through the Supreme Court, has already acted to protect parental
rights under the due process clause of the 14th Amendment. Congress
is given express authority to enact legislation to protect due
process rights of citizens by Section Five of the 14th Amendment.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The clash over parental rights<br>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

It is important to remember that federal parental rights legislation
would not give Congress substantive authority over areas which
are properly a matter of state jurisdiction, such as education.
But when state regulation of education results in the violation
of  parents' constitutional rights, the federal government may
intervene to protect these rights.[40]

<p>

The federal parental rights legislation would not expand government
by creating a new federal &quot;program.&quot;  The PRRA would
not increase federal spending or require a new federal administrative
agency. Rather, the PRRA is a <I>negative</I> mandate on government.
It checks power, not enhances it.

<p>

<center><h3>The Fundamental Question: Who Decides?</h3></center>

<p>

Critics of both the federal parental rights bill and the state
constitutional amendments typically claim that parental rights
laws would make it tougher for the state to protect children from
abuse, and would give one parent the right to dictate school curriculum
for everyone else's child, leading to education gridlock.

<p>

These and most other criticisms are grounded in the mistaken
notion that these proposals would provide an <I>absolute</I> right
for parents, which would override any state interest in the welfare
and education of children.  But as both proposals seek to codify
the Meyer-Pierce doctrine, the well-established limits to parental
rights under this doctrine would continue to apply.

<p>

For example, in <I>Prince</I>, the high court made it clear
that &quot;neither the right of religion <I>nor the rights of
parents are beyond limitation</I>&quot; (Emphasis added).
<I>Prince</I> identified numerous areas in which the state may set
limits on parental rights, such as compulsory school attendance,
mandatory vaccination policies, and child labor laws.  And in
<I>Runyon v. McCrary,</I>[41] the Supreme Court held that parents
&quot;have no constitutional right to provide their children with
. . . education unfettered by reasonable government regulation.&quot;
All constitutional rights have their limits, and parental rights
are no exception.

<p>

The clash over parental rights proposals begs the fundamental
question: <I>Who decides what's in the best interests of childen?
Parents? Or the government?</I>  Are ordinary parents generally
competent to raise their children or should parents defer to elite
authorities backed by state power?

<p>

Unable to attack the underlying constitutional doctrine of
parent's rights, yet adamantly opposed to the people acting to
codify this doctrine through the democratic process, opponents
sometimes find themselves in the awkward position best expressed
by Elliot Mincberg, Executive Director of People for the American
Way, in criticizing the state Parental Rights Amendment: &quot;Our
view is that the Amendment is either unnecessary or it would seriously
conflict with the current legal notion of parental rights and
responsibilities.&quot;[42] Presumably, parental rights laws are
&quot;unnecessary&quot; in light of Supreme Court cases, which,
if codified, would be somehow radical and dangerous.

<p>

Other opponents go a step further in making explicit the fact
that parental rights laws are incompatible with the &quot;children's
rights&quot; agenda.  Professor Barbara Bennett Woodhouse of 
the University of Pennsylvania has written that the child should
be seen as &quot;having a direct relationship with government
. . . as public resource and public ward, entitled both to make
claims upon the community and to be claimed by the community.&quot;[43]
Prof. Woodhouse believes that focusing on parents' individual
rights &quot;objectifies&quot; children, and that the law should
concentrate on whether parents have &quot;earned&quot; the authority
they exercise over the child.[44]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

How might parents &quot;earn&quot; their authority? Perhaps
through government-mandated licensing of parents, as proposed
by Dr. Jack C. Westman, professor of psychiatry at the University
of Wisconsin. &quot;Just as individual responsibility for driving
a car is certified by a driver's license, the individual responsibility
of a parent for child rearing would be certified by a parenting
license.&quot;[45] Requiring parents to obtain a government license
before being allowed to conceive and bear children would complete
the shift from the state acting <I>in loco parentis</I> to the
state <I>as</I> parent. Primary authority over children would
inhere in the state, which would then delegate its authority to
the biological parents of the child -- assuming they pass the
exam.[46]

<p>

<center><h3>Linking Rights and Responsibilities</h3></center>

<p>

If successful, the parental rights movement will provide parents
with greater legal standing to ensure that government respects
their rights through its policies, and, when necessary, in the
courts.  But beyond this immediate, practical benefit, a national
debate on parental rights also has great potential to foster more
parental responsibility.

<p>

The key to encouraging greater parental responsibility is to
explicitly recognize the link between rights and duties upon which
this nation was founded, and to renew our optimism in the ability
of the people to manage their own affairs, as citizens and as
parents.  Indeed, &quot;the most terribly important things must
be left to ordinary men themselves,&quot; including the right
of parents to protect their children from harmful influences and
to direct their children's upbringing.  Recognizing the irreplaceable
role of parents is essential to keeping the power of the state
in check, revitalizing citizenship, and ensuring that children
receive the love, protection and guidance only a parent can provide.

because it places Amish children in an environment hostile to
Amish beliefs with increasing emphasis on competition in class
work and sports and with pressure to conform to the styles, manners,
and ways of the peer group, but also because it takes them away
from their community, physically and emotionally, during the crucial

<title>Gary Bauer's September, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

September 13, 1996

<p><br><br>

<ul><ul>

<i>Restoring parental rights to their original firm foundation
in U.S. constitutional law is crucial to our overall efforts to
reinvigorate the democratic ideal of citizenship.</i>

</ul></ul>

<p><center>

-- from <i><b>FRC's Moms' and Dads' School Survival Guide</b></i>

</center><p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

A few weeks ago Carol and I drove our oldest daughter, Elyse,
back to college for her second year of studies.  It was wonderful
to have her home for the summer, and saying good-bye was really
hard.  The summer months flew by, reminding us once more how precious
is the time that we have together as a family.  Even though Elyse
attends college only a few hours' drive from our home outside
Washington, D.C. -- close enough for us to see her on some weekends -- 
she's still much farther away than we would prefer.

<p>

Millions of families go through this emotional ritual each September,
and it doesn't really matter that much whether your child is heading
off to college, high school, or to a nearby elementary school
classroom.  Each fall mothers and fathers face the same anxieties
and pressures:  how will my children fare in school?  Will their
teachers recognize their special qualities?  Will teachers honor
and respect their talents and beliefs or will they try to convince
them to &quot;question authority&quot; and reject the values they
have been taught?  What about their classmates?  Will they make
friends?  Will those friends help uphold their faith?  Or will
their faith be weakened?  Or worse, will our children be lead
into trouble?  Is there anyone out there besides us who really
understands the worth of our beloved children?

<p>

Today, questions like these are being asked by every parent and
they unfortunately have a special sharpness to them.  Many of
our nation's schools are no longer the &quot;common ground&quot;
of shared values and aspirations that generations of families
counted on them to be in the past. All too often, today's classrooms
are laboratories for radical ideological experimentation. The
teaching profession has been politicized as never before. Textbooks
and lesson plans routinely foster a liberal world view. Attempts
to isolate, intimidate and confuse religiously inclined students
continue. Violence and illegal drugs are found even in elementary
schools. The &quot;safe sex&quot; philosophy still dominates
sex education.

<p>

I'm sure you're familiar with the statistics on educational decline,
so I won't repeat them here.  The public education establishment
routinely goes out of its way to question the depth of the problem,
but, in the same breath, rushes to endorse the latest reform plan,
a tacit admission that our schools are falling short.  Let me
be especially clear here:  many, if not most, of our teachers
are dedicated educators who are motivated by a love of learning
and of children.  Many, if not most, are disturbed by the same
education fads that distress parents.  Like parents, these teachers
are ill-served by education leaders who are constantly reinventing
the wheel and interfering with what works in real classrooms.

<p>

In fact, the education policy debate of the last few years has
been dominated by the <I>illusion</I> of reform. With every fiber
of their being, the leadership of the nation's massive teachers'
unions, the National Education Association (2.2 million members)
and the American Federation of Teachers (900,000), have opposed
nearly every change in the way our schools are financed and operated.

<p>

Bogus education reform schemes come and go.  Many of them have
impressive-sounding names and a stellar line-up of sponsors.
Desperate for signs of improvement that will give their children
hope, parents are sold various reform packages under such brand
names as Outcome-Based Education, Goals 2000, character education,
mandatory voluntarism, New American Schools and restructuring.
These schemes have different details, but they have at least
two omissions in common:  they leave the basic method of funding
public education untouched, and they leave parents at the margin
of education decision-making.

<p>

The Family Research Council (FRC) is keenly aware of the concerns
expressed by America's families about education, and we are dedicated
to reversing these omissions.  We want parents to control their
education dollars.  We believe that the same hands that rock the
cradle, smooth the fevered brow, set the table, and clothe the
child should direct the funds that educate the child.  The centerpiece
of our campaign for education reform is massive tax relief for
families with children, coupled with genuine parental choice policies
that enable parents to select the school their children will attend.

<p>

Today, more than ever before, I am optimistic about our chances
for success.  School choice plans are gaining momentum and making
headway.  A new study by Harvard's Paul Peterson and Jay P. Greene
at the University of Houston shows that the City of Milwaukee's
parental choice plan has resulted in real academic gains for the
children enrolled in the program.  In August, state courts in
Ohio upheld the constitutionality of a school choice program that
includes religious schools.  Tax credits for families with children
will now be a centerpiece of this year's election debate.

<p>

Most importantly, I'm encouraged that, in the true spirit of
America, parents are not waiting for politicians to respond to
their needs.  They are moving in pioneering numbers to options
like homeschooling, classical education and parent-based education,
which are not so much novelties as rediscoveries of the art of
family-centered teaching and learning.  At the center of all of
this is spiritual renewal, the faith that moves mountains.

<p>

With all of the forces at work in today's education debate, FRC
has developed the <I>Moms' and Dads' School Survival Guide</I>.
This 64-page booklet is packed with resources to help you through
the coming school year.  Between its covers you'll find:

<p><ul>

<li>A glossary of education jargon -- what do the fancy terms 
<I>really</I> mean?

<p>

<li>Feature articles on major topics like Outcome-Based Education,
the religious rights of students, and parental rights in today's
schools.

<p>

<li>Addresses and phone numbers of key resources for homeschooling
and classical education.

<p>

<li>A reference section containing everything from newsletter sources
to web sites dealing with education issues.

</ul><p>

Our <I>Survival Guide</I> is designed to put a wealth of helpful
information at your fingertips.  It's yours for a donation of
any amount -- please use the enclosed reply card to order your copy
today.

<p>

I had intended this letter to deal solely with education issues,
but drug abuse and educational failure feed off one another.
There is no way to dismiss the disturbing statistics: in the
war against teenage drug abuse, America is in full retreat. A
new federal survey shows that teen drug use has risen 105 percent
since 1992.  The sharp increases span every form of illegal drug.
Use of LSD and other hallucinogens is up 183 percent; cocaine
use, 166 percent (from 1994 to 1995 alone); marijuana, 105 percent.
One of every 10 teenagers has used an illegal drug in the past
month.

<p>

The tragedy here is that these numbers come after a decade of
progress.  By 1992, teen drug use had been driven to its lowest
point in decades.  The reason for that progress was and is easy
to understand. Our nation's policy was direct -- and repeated over
and over again in every forum where young people gather.  It said:
&quot;Drug abuse is wrong, dangerous, and stupid.&quot;  But
then, following a change in the Oval Office, we changed course.

<p>

The flow of anti-drug messages from our nation's capital dried
up.  The Clinton administration cut the office of National Drug
Control Policy some 83 percent.  MTV, and even the networks, began
to produce material that winked at the drug threat, or openly
declared the war on drugs a failure. Leaders in Congress turned
their attention to other issues. Treatment funds were reduced,
and &quot;civil libertarians&quot; ratcheted up their pressure
on highly effective social agencies like Teen Challenge that use
faith-based messages to help teenagers and young adults kick the
habit.

<p>

Let me say something here about the liberal versus conservative
debate about the treatment versus law enforcement approaches to
drug abuse.  In fact, let me say one word about it -- it is a 
<I>fallacy.</I> Both approaches are needed.  Drug abusers need treatment
if they are to re-enter society as productive citizens.  But the
truth is that even the best treatment programs are only partially
successful. Preventing the abuser from taking that first hit,
snort, or injection is crucial.

<p>

Who would propose that we eliminate hospital emergency rooms
to treat automobile accident victims?  No one, of course.  Then
again, who would argue that we eliminate speed limits, safety
belts, guard rails, and the like because, after all, we have emergency
rooms? But that's precisely what advocates of drug legalization
argue! Remember when then-Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders suggested
that problems like crime would be reduced if America legalized
drug use, saying it was time to study this option and rely on
treatment rather than law enforcement?

<p>

Elders, thankfully, is gone, but the legacy of permissiveness
she represented is reflected in what is happening now to our youth.
Last month, my senior adviser for drug issues, retired Army Lieutenant
Colonel Bob Maginnis, met with General Barry McCaffrey, President
Clinton's drug czar.  Gen. McCaffrey is a dedicated man, but he
has his work cut out for him.  FRC offered the general our heartfelt
support and suggested various ways to recapture the initiative.
New efforts to control the flow of drugs through Mexico and out
of Colombia are especially needed.

<p>

Again, we must not settle for illusion.  Attempting to treat
an ever-rising wave of drug-abusing youth will destroy our economy
and bankrupt this nation -- and, worst of all, waste the potential
of thousands of our children. Attempting to reform education
without putting parents back at the center of school decision-making
is doomed to fail as well. As always, on both of these issues,
FRC will continue to fight for the home truths that really matter:
we will work with legislators, government officials -- anyone of
goodwill, regardless of party -- who recognizes the need to strengthen
our education system and to gird our children against the sex-and-drug
culture.

<p>

We would really like to hear from you this month.  Your financial
gifts to FRC provide the lifeblood that enables us to advance
the pro-family cause.  Your prayers and involvement are essential,
too.  The cards and letters we receive provide a tremendous lift
to me and the entire FRC staff.  Because the work we do is both
draining and difficult, being able to associate names and faces
with the cause we are advancing makes our efforts all the more
meaningful.

<p>

Once again, thank you for your faithfulness.  As we continue
to work together, we can move closer to our hope and dream of
family renewal in our beloved nation.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S. As our <I>Survival Guide</I> illustrates, FRC is constantly
developing new materials that make the case for family values.
Let me close by mentioning another resource that you've helped
to make a household word: <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams.</I> This
companion book to the family values debate of 1996 has now reached
a total distribution of nearly 400,000 copies.

<p>

I conceived <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> as a vision for a pro-family
future -- a book that would make the case for our cause to a cross-section
of the American public. Earlier this year, FRC took out paid
advertising posing a challenge to Hillary Rodham Clinton, who
had just released her book, <I>It Takes a Village.</I> We asked
the American people to choose between the alternative visions
represented by these books.  I'm pleased to report that, thanks
to support like yours, <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> has held its
own in this contest of visions.

<p>

Our original goal was to distribute 1,000,000 copies of <I>Our
Hopes, Our Dreams,</I> and to get them into the hands of people
who may not know just how much today's cultural clash over the
family means to them. If you can help us make one last push to
reach this goal and to spread the pro-family message, please take
this opportunity to do so. The enclosed card has all the information
you need.

<p>
As members of Congress consider legislative proposals that will lead us into the next century, it is important that we understand the demographic composition of the districts they represent. This book does just that. We have used 1990 Long Form Census information, and ranked the Congressional Districts in numerous key categories, including the total amount of public assistance districts get, the total amount of farm income, the number of people who have a mortgage, just to name a few. In all we have 97 different categories to look at.<p>The layout of these reports is straightforward. <p>



<pre>
              People Over 65 -- Percent
       Congressional District Average:	12.5%

		State	CD	%	Deviation

	1.	FL	22	31.1%	5.49
	2.	FL	13	30.9%	5.44
	3.	FL	19	28.1%	4.62
	4.	FL	10	26.2%	4.03
	5.	FL	05	25.7%	3.88
	6.	FL	14	25.6%	3.87
	7.	FL	16	23.9%	3.36
	8.	FL	09	21.7%	2.70
	9.	AZ	03	19.7%	2.13

</pre>





<ul><li>The ranking is simply where the Congressional District is in relation to the other 434 and the District of Columbia.<p><li>The CD identifies each district with the two letter state abbreviation, and the Congressional District number within the state. 
<p>
<li>The # or % is the actual information. For example, the % of Asians in a district.
<p>
<li>The deviation is a little more complex. This is to show how far from the average a particular district is. It answers the question of whether the district is just slightly different from the national average, or significantly different. It also allows you to see the difference between two districts more clearly as well. 
<p>
<li>For more information on the U.S. Census Bureau, visit their web page, at <a href="http://www.census.gov/">http://www.census.gov/</a>

</ul><p>
We hope this book will give readers a better understanding of all the Congressional Districts and what issues members might be concerned about.

<title>THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON EDUCATION OF HOMOSEXUAL 'MARRIAGE'</title>

<body>

<h2>THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON<br>
EDUCATION CURRICULA AND<br>
POLICY OF HOMOSEXUAL<br>
'MARRIAGE'</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by<br>
Linda Page</center>

<p>

This speech was presented at a July 2, 1996 Capitol Hill briefing
regarding the Defense of Marriage Act.  The briefing was sponsored
by the Family Research Council.</i>

<p>

The legal recognition of same-sex &quot;marriage&quot; has the
potential to wreak havoc on an already failing public education
system.  Without a doubt, it can fundamentally affect every aspect
of schooling for children.  It will only further erode the moral
base on which our society depends and which our young people so
desperately need.  How ironic that teachers are prohibited by
law from sharing their Christian faith, or school from even posting
a copy of the Ten Commandments at the same time that homosexuals
are radically attacking our bedrock institutions.  What message
are we giving to highly impressionable students regarding our
society's most crucial values?

<p>

Doesn't it signify that legally equating same-sex &quot;marriage&quot;
with our most important social institution is in direct contradiction
to the most deeply held beliefs and values of the overwhelming
majority of Americans?  When was democracy also redefined to mean
that the beliefs and standards of the majority must succumb to
the whims of a special interest group -- even when those whims
are devastatingly destructive to the common good?

<p>

I've been a classroom teacher, reading specialist, an early childhood
education coordinator, and principal in the public schools.  I've
taught first-graders as well as older students.  I've worked the
suburbs and in the inner cities.  I've seen countless programs
implemented throughout the years based on whatever the policymakers
decided schools should teach or on the latest government- or 
university-sponsored ideas. Whatever the latest education craze 
happened to be, educators have been pressured to jump on the bandwagon.

<p>

Phonics was displaced by whole language. &quot;Modern math&quot;
replaced an emphasis on mastery of computation and problem solving
skills.  Explicit sexual training replaced &quot;family life 
education.&quot;  Consider the recent
classic example of William Spady's Outcome Based Education developed
as Far West Regional Lab.  Hundreds of millions of dollars have
been spent using our children as guinea pigs and our classrooms
as labs for unproved educational notions.  Programs which are
in direct contradictions to the values of mainstream America have
been created using taxpayers' money and implemented wholesale
in the schools time and time again.

<p>

As we have progressively made our schools <I><B>less</B></I> about
academics -- only 41 percent of the time secondary students spend
in schools is on academic subjects -- we have virtually expunged
traditional core values from our curricula and textbooks.  The
most far-reaching and damaging method for accomplishing this ignominious
feat has been through the implementation of values clarifications
programs.  According to William Kilpatrick, &quot;For students
it has meant learning to question values they have scarcely acquired,
unlearning values taught at home, and concluding that questions
of right and wrong are always merely subjective.&quot;

<p>

Theodore Roosevelt once said, &quot;To educate a person in mind
and not in morals is to educate a menace to society.&quot;  When
combined whit the unrestrained pursuit of self-interest, the values
clarification approach, also known as the decision-making model,
is reaping results of violence, mayhem, and devastating of the
worst kind among our students.  Why would we even consider further
denigration of values which have stood the test of time and opt
instead for the ill-conceived supposition that all values are
equal?

<p>

<center><h3>POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON SCHOOL CURRICULA AND EDUCATION 
POLICY</h3></center>

<p>

Same-sex &quot;marriage&quot; recognized by law has the mind's
numbing potential to bring with it untold quantities of new and
ravaging educational mandates.  It is possible that classroom
teachers all over the country will be required to implement any
or all of a range of potential changes in our schools.  They might
include:

<ul><p>

<li>Providing new and more intensified self-esteem programs, with
a special homosexual emphasis.  Project 10 was founded by Dr.
Virginia Uribe in 1984 in LAUSD as the first openly homosexual
counseling program.  It also includes sensitivity training for
faculty and tactics to prevent &quot;homophobia&quot; within the
classroom.

<p>

<li>Teaching students that homosexuality is a positive choice.
Three key strategies in Project 10 materials &quot;for managing
heterosexism and homophobia in schooling&quot; are:  1) Include
lesbian and gay issues in curriculum; 2) Include readings which
address homosexual issues on required reading lists; and 3) Encourage
students to write about and discuss &quot;the ways in which homophobia
has impacted their lives.&quot; (Project 10 Handbook)

<p>

<li>An increased emphasis on teaching critical thinking skills
based on students' <I><B>feelings</B></I> about issues instead
of the facts.

<p>

<li>Orwellian &quot;doublespeak&quot; of many new vocabulary words
to accompany the new definition of family.

<p>

<li>Using newly-revised tests and textbooks which are politically-correct.
A 15-page segment in the 443-page <I>Children of the Rainbow</I>
curriculum titled, &quot;Fostering Positive Attitudes Toward Sexuality&quot;
was authored by lesbian Elissa Weindling at the request of the
Gay and Lesbian Teacher's Association.  As a lesbian herself,
she states that, &quot;Teachers of first-graders will have an
opportunity to give children a healthy sense of identity at an
early age.  Classes should include references to lesbian/gay people
in all curricular areas. . . .&quot;

<p>

<li>Teaching &quot;tolerance&quot; of homosexuality in the context
of school to work preparedness.

<p>

<li>Teaching state and national standards which support the value
of homosexual &quot;marriage&quot; while undermining traditional
values.

<p>

<li>Stronger moral relativism in all school programs.

<p>

<li>Teaching increasingly liberal, permissive sex education.

<p>

<li>Supporting students in the scorn of virtue and self-restraint
while promoting increased narcissism and self-gratification.

<p>

<li>Teaching the complete redefinition of the family in every
grade level and in every curricular area, beginning with kindergarten
and preschool students (since their social studies curriculum
is about the family).

<p>

<li>Teaching literature to which parents object.  (Selections
which could be included and required with the societal sanction
of same-sex &quot;marriage&quot; and the lifestyle which spawned
it should cause every parent to be alarmed.)

<p>

<li>Using more of the already-diminished academic time on social
engineering.

<p>

<li>Teaching new revisions in history which could encompass a
scope far more vast and revisionist than those in the original
proposed national history standards.

<p>

<li>Supporting the politically-correct reinvention of society
even while &quot;research has documented that children without
fathers more often have lower academic performance, more cognitive
and intellectual deficits, increased adjustment problems, and
higher risks for psychosexual development problems.&quot; (George
Rekers)

<p>

<li>Teaching students that whatever they <I><B>think</B></I> is
right or <I><B>feel</B></I> is right <I><B>is</B></I> right, instead
of teaching students genuine critical thinking which necessitates
learning to discern and express what is true -- to submit to truth
and to a set of absolutes.

<p>

<li>Teaching students circular reasoning where they start with
the desired premise and make statements to support it which &quot;prove&quot;
the issue as fact.

<p>

<li>Teaching segments of the <I>Children of the Rainbow</I> curriculum
which promote homosexuality beginning at the earliest levels of
schooling.  (The implementation of this &quot;experiment&quot;
caused a furor in New York City not many years ago with its use
of primary-level reading books such as <I>Heather Has Two Mommies</I>
and <I>Daddy's Roommate</I> which states that &quot;gay is just
another kind of love.&quot;  These books blatantly and frankly
promote same-sex parenting.)  What will happen to educators who
refuse to teach the new curricula endorsing same-sex &quot;marriage&quot;?

<p>

<li>Teaching major revisions in curricula for literature, reading,
health, sex education. P.E. and drama.

<p>

<li>Supporting extracurricular activities which accommodate gay
and lesbian dating. In May 1994, LAUSD authorized the first gay and 
lesbian prom in the country. (Michael Quintinella)

<p>

<li>Further undermining of parental values and beliefs with more
intensive erosion of the traditional rights of parents.  Same
sex marriage with the force of law will take the rights of parents
away to decide what their children are taught about homosexuality.

<p>

<li>Diluting character education programs to accommodate the new
value system.

<p>

<li>Implementing new state and national standards which present
homosexual marriage as equal to traditional family values.

</ul><p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

At precisely the time when schools and society are recognizing
the serious need for character education -- for personal responsibility,
self-discipline and other core virtues -- the most important social
institution on our society is receiving the most serious threat
it has faced in recorded history.

<p>

When doing what <I>feels</I> good matters more than doing what
is right, character education based on absolutes and traditional
moral standards will become a complete misnomer.  Self-control
and responsibility for the greater good will be a contradiction
to the same-sex &quot;marriage&quot; value system.  Since absolutes
of right and wrong will be negated, cheating in schools and students
stealing from each other will also have to be &quot;tolerated,&quot;
among other &quot;values.&quot;

<p>

As Thomas Sowell has stated so well, &quot;To teach issues instead
of intellectual principles to school children is like teaching
calculus to people who have not yet learned arithmetic, or surgery
to people lacking the rudiments of anatomy or hygiene.  Worse,
it is teaching them to go ahead and perform surgery, without worrying
about boring details.&quot;

<p>

Our schools reverberate with violence, declining achievement,
and disrespect for authority.  Legalization of same sex marriage
will only further erode the morel underpinnings and the culture
of the family which has been a primary source of strength throughout
the history of this country and of western civilization.

<p>

At one time in the history of our country, education was virtually
synonymous with moral training.  The traditional virtues and cultural
mores were passed down from generation to generation because they
work.

<p>

Our students have been guinea pigs in Russian roulette with their
futures long enough.  Same-sex &quot;marriage&quot; is a result
of a destructive, narcissistic way of thinking and of 
&quot;value-neutral&quot; curriculums.  One can only shudder to 
consider the horrific possibilities which may occur on the sexuality 
continuum with the perpetuation of such policies.

<p>

Instead of &quot;tolerance and diversity&quot; training for teachers,
we need to implement training programs where educators learn the
noble facts about our country's history and how to teach them
to our students.  They need to become well-versed in the legal
parameters for teaching about religion and the values and virtues
which strengthen our society.

<p>

Amitai Etzioni in <I>The Spirit of Community</I> states, &quot;To
shore up the moral foundations of our society, we start with the
family.  Second in line are the schools.  They are more than places
in which people acquire skills and knowledge....Education includes
the reinforcement of values gained at home and the introduction
of values to those children whose parents neglected their character
formation and moral upbringing.  Third are the social webs that
communities provide in neighborhoods, at work, and in ethnic clubs
and associations....Fourth, the national society must ensure that
local communities will not lock in values that we ars a more encompassing
and overriding community, abhor...&quot;

<p>

He states further, &quot;In the 50s we had a well-established
society, but it was unfair to women and minorities and a bit authoritarian.
In the 60s we undermined the established society and its values.
In the 80s we were told that the unbridled pursuit of self-interest
was virtuous.  By the 90s we have seen the cumulative results.&quot;

<p>

Where do we go from here?  The destruction of one of our most
vital institutions is threatened.  We must protect our children
now.

<title>CARING FOR OUR CHILDREN</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">

<p>

<h2>CARING FOR OUR CHILDREN</h2></center>

<p>

A recent Census Bureau report states that the majority of preschool
children are cared for in a home environment while their mother
works, while school-aged children are typically in school during
their mother's working hours.

<p>

Sixty-three percent of preschool children of employed women spend
their mother's working hours in a home environment,[1] 51.8 percent
of whom are spending time with either their father or grandparent.
Of all preschool children, 15.9 percent are cared for by their
fathers while their mother works;  16.5 percent are cared for
by a grandparent.  Another relative cares for 8.8 percent of preschool
children.  Seventeen percent are cared for by a non-relative at
the provider's home.[2] Only 29.9 percent of all children under
the age of 5 rely upon an organized day care facility for care.[3]

<p>

This data also supports the finding that mothers of school-aged
children work part-time -- 74 percent of children between 5 and
14 years of age are at school while their mother works.  Six percent
of preschool children are with their mothers while they work.
A 1993 Roper poll conducted on behalf of Family Circle magazine
found that in 55 percent of households the child's parent or guardian
usually cared for children under 14 when they were not in school.
Twelve percent were cared for by a grandparent.  Comparatively,
13 percent were in a day care, preschool, or after school program
during non-school hours.[4]

<p>

Few statistics indicate how many children are in the care of an
at-home mother, even though it has been documented that children
reared at home by a parent fare far better in life-long cognitive
ability.[5] There are, however, some demonstrative statistics: 
40.2 percent of divorced, separated and widowed mothers of children
under 6 years old don't work, and 40.1 percent of married mothers
of children under 6 years old don't work.[6]

<title>PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTIONS: DISPELLING THE MYTHS</title>

<body>

<p>

<h2>PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTIONS:<br>
DISPELLING THE MYTHS</h2></center>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

Pro-abortion forces, with the help of a sympathetic media, have
succeeded in spreading many myths and much misinformation regarding
partial-birth abortions and H.R. 1833, the Partial-Birth Abortion
Ban Act.  The following information is intended to dispel the
myths and present &quot;just the facts&quot; regarding the practice
of partial-birth abortion.

<p>

<B>FACT</B>:  Partial-birth abortions involve aborting partially-delivered
babies from four and a half months into pregnancy up to even the
ninth month.  The procedure consists of partially delivering the
live baby feet first so that all but the head is outside the mother's
womb.  If the abortionist made a &quot;mistake&quot; and the baby's
head slipped out of the mother, the child would be considered
legally a person.  The head remains in the uterus while the abortionist
kills the baby by stabbing surgical scissors into the base of
its head to create an opening.  The abortionist then suctions
out the brain by a small tube (which collapses the scull), then
completes the delivery of the now-dead baby.  The legislation
would make it a crime to perform this procedure except to save
the mother's life.

<p>

<B>FACT</B>:  Although both Houses of Congress passed H.R. 1833,
the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, President Bill Clinton vetoed
the legislation on April 10, 1996.  On April 15, the bill was
referred back to the House Judiciary Committee.  President Clinton
defended his veto of this legislation by saying that he wanted
to protect the &quot;health&quot; of the mothers involved.  However,
&quot;health&quot; is so broadly defined in the context of U.S.
abortion law as to include &quot;all factors -- physical, emotional,
psychological, familial, and the woman's age -- relevant to the
well-being of the patient&quot; (1973 Supreme Court decision in
<I>Doe v. Bolton</I>).  Thus, President Clinton's position to
protect the health of the mother would not stop one partial-birth
abortion from occurring, and would render the entire bill meaningless.
In fact, the &quot;health&quot; position Clinton has taken makes
every abortion legal for whatever reason.

<p>

<center><h3>DISPELLING THE MYTHS: A TRUE OR FALSE TEST</h3></center>

<p>

1.  True or False:  Partial-birth abortions are performed only
in extremely dire circumstances, i.e., to save the life of the
mother.

<p>

FALSE -- According to Dr. Martin Haskell, an abortionist who has
performed more than 1,000 partial-birth abortions, about 80 percent
are done for &quot;purely elective&quot; reasons.  The other 20 percent
are done for &quot;genetic reasons,&quot; which includes such
non-life-threatening conditions as having a cleft palate or Down's
Syndrome. <B>(&quot;Shock-tactic ads target late-term abortion
procedure,&quot; <I>American Medical News</I>, July 5, 1993.)</B>

<p>

2. True or False:  &quot;Elective abortion&quot; means electing
an abortion in a tough circumstance rather than risking death.

<p>

FALSE -- &quot;Elective&quot; means that there is no medically
necessary reason for the patient to undergo a certain procedure.
 For example, cosmetic surgery such as a face lift or a tummy
tuck are considered &quot;elective&quot; procedures.  Thus, an
elective partial-birth abortion means that the mother could have
given birth to a healthy baby, but chose to abort her child.

<p>

3. True or False: Partial-birth abortions must remain legal
because it is the only safe procedure available to women at that
late stage in pregnancy if a problem arises.

<p>

FALSE -- According to Dr. Pamela Smith, the Director of Medical
Education in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Mt.
Sinai Hospital in Chicago, &quot;There are absolutely no obstetrical
situations encountered in this country which require a partially-
delivered human fetus to be destroyed to preserve the health of
the mother.&quot;  For example, performing a Caesarean section
could produce a healthy mother and living child.  But even when
abortion (producing a dead baby) is the aim, Dr. Warren Hern,
an abortionist who specializes in late-term abortions, says that
even he would not perform a partial-birth abortion because it
is unsafe for the mother.  In an interview with the <I>American
Medical News</I>, he notes that turning the fetus to a breech
position is &quot;potentially dangerous&quot; and that &quot;you
have to be concerned about causing amniotic fluid embolism or
placental abruption if you do that.&quot; <B>(&quot;Outlawing
Abortion Method,&quot; <I>American Medical News</I>, November
20, 1995.)</B>

<p>

4. True or False: Although grotesque, the procedure of suctioning
out the brains of the fetus is necessary, otherwise the fetus'
head would be too large to pass through the birth canal.

<p>

FALSE -- In an October 28, 1995 letter to Congressman Charles
Canady (R-Fla.), Dr. Smith said that &quot;cephalocentesis (drainage
of fluid from the head of a hydrocephalic fetus) frequently results
in the birth of a living child.&quot;  She adds that &quot;relaxing
the uterus with anesthesia, cutting the cervix (Duhrssen's incision)
and Caesarean section are the standard of care for a normal, head-entrapped
breech fetus.&quot;

<p>

5. True or False: In a partial-birth abortion, the anesthesia
the woman receives for pain actually kills the baby so that he
or she feels no pain.

<p>

FALSE -- During testimony before the House Judiciary Committee
in November 1995, Dr. Norig Ellison, president of the 32,000-member
American Society of Anesthesiologists, said, &quot;I believe this
statement to be entirely inaccurate.  I am deeply concerned, moreover,
that the widespread publicity given to Dr. McMahon's [a deceased
California physician who performed partial-birth abortions and
previously testified before Congress -- ed.] testimony may cause
pregnant women to delay necessary and perhaps life-saving medical
procedures, totally unrelated to the birthing process, due to
misinformation regarding the effects of anesthetics on the fetus.&quot;
Dr. David Birnbach, Director of Obstetric Anesthesiology at St.
Luke's Hospital in New York, said, &quot;Every day we have pregnant
patients who get anesthesia -- women who break their ankles, need
knee surgery, have appendectomies, gallbladder removals, breast
biopsies, and so on. Anesthetics done safely by an anesthesiologist
do not do harm to either the mother or the baby.&quot;

<p>

6. True or False: The under-developed fetus does not feel pain
from the partial-birth abortion.

<p>

FALSE -- Professor Robert White, director of the Division of Neurosurgery
and Brain Research Laboratory at Case Western Reserve School of
Medicine, Cleveland, told the House Constitution Subcommittee,
&quot;The fetus within this time frame of gestation, 20 weeks
and beyond, is fully capable of experiencing pain. Without a doubt,
this is a <I>dreadfully painful experience</I> for any such infant
subjected to such a surgical procedure.&quot; (Emphasis added.)
Paul Ranalli, M.D., a neurologist at the Faculty of Medicine
at the University of Toronto, wrote, &quot;Intriguingly, far from
being less able to detect pain, such premature newborns <I>may
be more sensitive to painful stimulation</I>.&quot; (Emphasis
added.)  He said that one study, regarding babies born under 30
weeks, indicates that it may be that &quot;the newly-established
pain system is 'raw' and unmodified at such a tender age.&quot;

<p>

7. True or False: Only pro-lifers supported the Partial-Birth
Abortion Ban Act.

<p>

FALSE -- On March 27, 1996, the U.S. House of Representatives
passed the bill by a vote of 286 to 129.  The U.S. Senate, on
December 7, 1995, passed the bill by a vote of 54 to 44.  Many
Congressmen and Senators who are admittedly &quot;pro-choice&quot;
voted in favor of the ban, such as House Minority Leader Dick
Gephardt (D-Mo.), Rep. Susan Molinari (R-N.Y.), and Rep. Patrick
Kennedy (D-R.I.).

<p>

8. True or False: The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act would force
women whose children had died in their wombs to keep carrying
them.

<p>

FALSE -- The word &quot;abort&quot; means &quot;to stop,&quot;
and an &quot;abortion&quot; is only an abortion if it stops a
progressing pregnancy.  If the child has already died in the womb,
removing the corpse would not ever be considered an abortion,
especially not a partial-birth abortion.  The Partial-Birth Abortion
Ban Act specifically defines a &quot;partial-birth abortion&quot;
as &quot;an abortion in which the person performing the abortion
partially vaginally delivers a <I>living</I> fetus before killing
the fetus and completing the delivery.&quot;  (Emphasis added.)

<p>

9. True or False: Partial-birth abortions are not a big problem
because so few are done each year.

<p>

FALSE -- Because abortion has been treated like a civil liberties
issue, rather than a medical one, abortion is not regulated with
the same kinds of laws governing medical care.  The numbers of
abortions performed, and the circumstances surrounding those abortions,
are made publicly available on the word of the abortion clinic
owners themselves, at their discretion.  We cannot verify the
number of late-term abortions done to children fully capable of
living outside the womb.  The public policy organization set up
by Planned Parenthood, the Allan Guttmacher Institute, is the
source often cited by the media.  What we know about the late-term,
partial-birth abortion, we have learned from the abortionists
themselves, describing their work to other medical practitioners
in publications like <I>American Medical News.</I>

<p>

10. True or False: It is illegal to perform abortions after
the first trimester (the first three months of pregnancy).  It
is also illegal to perform abortions for reasons like sex selection.

<p>

FALSE -- The 1973 Supreme Court decisions on abortion (<I>Roe
v. Wade</I> and <I>Doe v. Bolton</I>) <B>struck down</B> state
laws which protected the lives of unborn children.  The Court
did <B>not</B> provide any protection for the unborn, at any point
in pregnancy. Because of the &quot;health&quot; exception which
came from the <I>Doe v. Bolton</I> ruling, any abortion, at any
time, using any method, is effectively legal.  (Poll numbers show
that more than 70 percent of American adults do not know that
abortion is legal past the first trimester.)

<p>

11. True or False: If a woman experiences trouble late in her
pregnancy, she has to have an abortion or she may not be able
to have future children because her uterus may rupture.

<p>

FALSE -- The primary cause of sterility is blockage in the fallopian
tubes. According to Dr. David Stevens, a physician in Bristol,
Tennessee, sterility in a late-term pregnancy situation rarely
happens and is most likely to be caused by a ruptured uterus.
If the uterus is in danger of rupture, physicians usually drain
some fluid or proceed with a C-section. The normal course of action
would not be a partial-birth abortion.  A woman who experiences
late-term problems in her pregnancy does not need to fear blockage
in her fallopian tubes or interruption in her egg cycle, Stevens
said.

<title>TALKING POINTS: DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT (DOMA)</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">

<p>

<h2>TALKING POINTS:<br>
DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT<br>
(DOMA)</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Robert H. Knight</i></center>

<p><ul>

<li>Marriage is universal.  All cultures and all major religions
honor marriage.  Even though customs vary, it is always the bringing
together of the two sexes to form families.

<p>

<li>Homosexual couples are not the same as a husband and wife.
To say they are is to claim that men and women are the same,
with no appreciable differences, which is absurd.

<p>

<li>Marriage has already been so cheapened and undervalued that
homosexual activists now feel emboldened to deal the final indignity
-- separating the two sexes from each other.  No-fault divorce,
out-of-wedlock pregnancies and sexual promiscuity have weakened
support for marriage in the law and culture, with dire social
and economic consequences.  The answer is not to stretch the institution
further out of shape but to reassert support for the only model
that really works.

<p>

<li>Homosexuals are free to hold their own ceremonies, but when
they bring the law into it, they force everyone into it.  Under
the law, businesspeople would be forced to subsidize homosexual
relationships; children would have to be taught that homosexuality
is the moral equivalent of marital love, and anyone disagreeing
with the policy would be denounced as a &quot;bigot.&quot;

</ul><p>

<center><h3>A SAMPLE DIALOGUE</h3></center>

<p>

HOMOSEXUAL ACTIVISTS:  We just want the same things as you --
commitment, love, etc. You say you believe in &quot;family values.&quot;
Why not encourage us to form committed relationships?

<p>

ANSWER: You already can.  What you are asking us to do is to
pretend that two men or two women are the same as a marriage,
which they are not.  If you base these relationships on all the
qualities you just mentioned, why not demand that three men and
a woman be considered &quot;married?&quot;  Or how about a man
and a boy? Or two cousins?

<p>

ACTIVISTS:  You know as well as we do that that is not what we're
asking.  We just want to let two people who love each other have
the same rights as others.

<p>

ANSWER: You, like all citizens, already have the right to enter
into marriage by meeting that unique institution's central requirement
-- joining the opposite sex.  Once you break the one-man, one-woman
definition of marriage, there is no stopping point.  Several homosexual
activists have admitted that they want to redefine marriage so
they can enact the rest of the gay agenda.  Andrew Sullivan says
in his book <I>Virtually Normal</I> that gay male relationships
may be superior to marriage because gays understand the need for
outside sex.  So we are not even talking about monogamy here.

<p>

ACTIVISTS:  Right now, gay people can't visit their lovers in
hospitals.  They can't leave their property to their lover.  They
are denied a whole range of protections given to married couples.
We need marriage to be equal.

<p>

ANSWER: That is extremely misleading.  Like other citizens, homosexuals
can draft any type of will that they want and leave their property
to anyone they want.  Family members do retain a higher standing
in challenges to wills, but that is the case whenever a will is
contested by anyone.  The same goes for the powers of attorney.
A homosexual can designate his lover or anyone else as the executor
of his estate or as guardian of his health in the event of an
untimely, debilitating illness.  As far as hospital visitation,
that is not a federal issue, nor should it be.  Families have
been given preference in visitation because family ties transcend
other types of relationships -- as well they should. Homosexuals
are free to lobby individual hospitals as well as local authorities
to change their rules regarding visitation.  But they do not need
to overturn the institution of marriage to do so.

<p>

ACTIVISTS: What about married couples who don't have children?
Would you take away their licenses?

<p>

ANSWER: Marriage is a social good even without children, but
it overwhelmingly is about forming families, preserving kinship
and providing for future generations.  Exceptions do not disprove
the rule.  Besides, those couples who are childless can either
choose to conceive or to adopt to give a child a mother and a
father.  A homosexual couple by definition is motherless or fatherless,
and it is not in the best interests of children or society to
deliberately create motherless or fatherless families.

<p>

ACTIVISTS: Years ago, some groups supported laws preventing blacks
and whites from marrying and also keeping blacks out of the military.
They used all the same arguments then.   But we overcame their
prejudice and moved ahead.

<p>

ANSWER:  The Family Research Council and other pro-family groups
have always supported the civil rights movement, which is about
eliminating discrimination.  Second,  skin color and sexual behavior
are entirely different.  We don't know any former African-Americans,
but we do know some former homosexuals.   Jim Crow laws were invented
to keep blacks down, but marriage was not invented to keep homosexuals
down.  Equating the two is inaccurate and is merely a politically
expedient tactic.

<p>

ACTIVISTS: The lives of lesbian and gay people are under attack
all over the country by extremist groups.  They are trying to
shut down debate on gay marriage by passing unnecessary and mean-spirited
laws.

<p>

ANSWER: Pro-family Americans are not radically trying to change
marriage or force homosexuals to recognize a radical new institution.
It is extremist to pretend that two homosexual men are the equivalent
of a man and a woman, biologically, psychologically and socially.
Two men cannot provide the same experience as a mother in a child's
life, and a father cannot be replaced by two lesbians.  No culture
has sanctioned the homosexual relationship as &quot;marriage,&quot;
because it is not marriage.

<p>

ACTIVISTS: DOMA and these state laws are not necessary.  Full
faith and credit has worked fine for many years.  Extremist groups
are reacting to something that hasn't even happened yet.  This
is an attempt to shut off debate.

<p>

ANSWER:  Why should we wait until unelected judges in Hawaii impose
their views on the rest of the American people?  What's to stop
some other radical judge somewhere else from trying this?

<p>

ACTIVISTS: These are nothing but ugly attempts to use the federal
government to discriminate against gay people.  Are you telling
us that big government should be telling the states what to do?

<p>

ANSWER: DOMA allows the states the freedom NOT to have another
state's radical redefinition of marriage imposed on them.  In
no way does the federal government tell the states what to do.

<p>

ACTIVISTS:  This is just an attempt to stop debate on the topic.
It's an attempt to shut down the public dialogue on this issue.

<p>

ANSWER: Who was trying to keep the issue off the ballot in Hawaii
and elsewhere?  Homosexual lawyers with the American Civil Liberties
Union and the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund have tried
to squash ballot measures in Maine, Colorado, Washington State
and elsewhere.  They are trying to force their agenda on America
by judicial fiat.

<p>

ACTIVISTS: This is extremist!

<p>

ANSWER:  Do you really think that name-calling can substitute
for a sound argument?  Polls show that about 70 percent of the
American people oppose same-sex &quot;marriage,&quot; and in Hawaii
it is rising.  At last count it was 74 percent.  The more people
know about it, the more people oppose it.  Are all these people
extremists?

<title>WHY SO MANY AMERICANS OPPOSE THE CAREERS BILL</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">

<p>

<h2>WHY SO MANY AMERICANS OPPOSE<br>
THE CAREERS BILL</h2></center>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) recently circulated a &quot;Dear Colleague&quot;
letter expressing his concerns about the education agenda embodied
in Goals 2000, School-to-Work, and most recently, CAREERS.  In
defense of their CAREERS legislation, Rep. Bill Goodling (R-Pa.)
and Rep. Buck McKeon (R-Calif.) sent a &quot;Dear Colleague&quot;
letter which attempted to address Mr. Hyde's concerns.

<p>

Regrettably, neither the Goodling/McKeon responses nor the changes
made to the CAREERS bill since its introduction have resolved
the central issues that trouble Mr. Hyde, pro-family groups, conservative
economic groups, and thousands of families across the country.
The following central provisions are unacceptable:

<p>

<b>The creation of a workforce development infrastructure.</b>
The CAREERS bill requires the creation of state and local workforce
development boards that will oversee all aspects of the &quot;seamless
system&quot; of workforce development.  These boards will be appointed,
not elected.  The system has more resemblance to centrally planned
industrial policy than to the American free market tradition.
The jurisdiction of the workforce development boards will include
programs for in-school youth, thereby infringing on the authority
of locally elected school boards.

<p>

<b>The Labor Market Information System (LMIS).</b> This system
would include &quot;<B>comprehensive</B> information on the socioeconomic
characteristics, and current employment status of the population,
including self-employed, part-time, and seasonal workers&quot;
(Title II, Sec. 21-22).  The Senate bill even requires the collection
of social security numbers so that wage data may be maintained
on individuals.  Furthermore, this national LMIS would be controlled
at the federal level by the U.S. Secretary of Labor.  LMIS thus
poses an ominous threat to personal privacy and should be rejected
on that basis.  But even if LMIS did not invade personal privacy,
it would still be an underfunded mandate to states and an inefficient
mechanism for helping people get jobs.  Why should the government
duplicate the labor market trend speculation already provided

<b>The inclusion of youth in a seamless system of workforce development.</b>
The needs of youth are much different from those of an unemployed
adult.  Vocational education should be a matter left to the local
control of elected school boards, not merged into a complex new
workforce development infrastructure.

<p>

We would welcome true block grant reform that would give states
authority to run job training according to their needs.  CAREERS,
however, <B>creates</B> a new system and more red tape by establishing
the workforce development infrastructure and expanding the Labor
Market Information System.

<p>

Following are some reactions to the responses made by Mr. Goodling
and Mr. McKeon to Mr. Hyde's letter.  The statements in italics
are taken directly from the Goodling-McKeon letter, including
their paraphrases of Mr. Hyde's concerns.

<p>

<i><b>CONCERN</b>: Is the CAREERS bill &quot;designed to advance
the School-to-Work phase of Goals 2000?&quot;  Are the roots of
this legislation tied to the work of the Clinton Administration?</i>

<p>

<i><b>RESPONSE</b>: No.  CAREERS is the product of Republican
efforts going back to the Reagan and Bush Administrations.  It
incorporates suggestions by a bipartisan coalition of reform-minded
colleagues, including many leading Republican Governors.</i>

<p><ul>

<b>I.</b> Don't forget the liberal ideas embodied in CAREERS.
Soon after Mr. Goodling introduced his National Workforce Preparation
and Development Reform Act (H.R. 2943), predecessor to CAREERS
in the 103d Congress, Sen. Ted Kennedy introduced a similar measure
in the Senate, the Job Training Consolidation and Reform Act (S. 2516).

<p>

According to <I>Congressional Quarterly</I> &quot;key components
of H.R. 2943 [Mr. Goodling's bill] were similar to language in
H.R. 2884 (<B>School-To-Work Opportunities Act</B> of 1993),&quot;
which the House passed on Nov. 15, 1993.  School-to-Work was President
Bill Clinton's second major education initiative.  Goals 2000
was the first.  CAREERS carries on the national system of workforce
development in School-to-Work and Title V of Goals 2000 (the National
Skill Standards Act of 1994).

</ul><p>

<i><b>CONCERN</b>: Does CAREERS reference Goals 2000?</i>

<p>

<i><b>RESPONSE</b>: No.  Nothing in this bill requires any State
to participate in Goals 2000, or to adopt education standards
or related education programs.</i>

<p><ul>

<b>II.</b> CAREERS would require a state to participate in a
program much like that of Title V of Goals 2000 (the National
Skill Standards Act of 1994).  Under this title, the National
Skill Standards Board is charged with developing a national system
of skill standards, skill certificates and skill assessments.

<p>

These elements are undeniably present in the CAREERS bill.  CAREERS
cites the National Skill Standards Board [Sec. 108(c)(3)], supports
government involvement with industry-approved standards [Sec.
110(f)(1)(D)] and supports the creation of skill certificates
[Sec 5(41)].

<p>

Of course there is no overt reference to Goals 2000, but the philosophy
of Goals 2000 is present in CAREERS:  &quot;experts&quot; and
government join together to recognize national standards which
are to be emulated by state and local participants as they fulfill
the requirements of the act.

</ul><p>

<i><b>CONCERN</b>: Does CAREERS require funds be used to implement
tech-prep, career counseling, or other career-related programs
at the earliest possible age?</i>

<p>

<i><b>RESPONSE</b>: No. Prior to House floor consideration,
all references to elementary education and to serving youth &quot;at
the earliest age possible&quot; were deleted from the bill.</i>

<p><ul>

<b>III.</b> Actually, Mr. Hyde's letter expressed this
concern about the <I><B>Senate bill</B></I> (S. 143), where career
guidance and counseling at the earliest possible age are still
<I><B>mandated</B></I> [Sec. 106(b)(3)].

</ul><p>

<i><b>CONCERN</b>: Does CAREERS require youth to pass &quot;performance
outcome assessments determined by the National Skill Standards
Board,&quot; that would replace high school diplomas?  Or require
that students at age 16 (10th grade) be placed in either vocational
training classes or apprenticeships?  Does CAREERS require that
students who are not prepared to enter vocational classes by age
16, be &quot;placed in youth centers&quot;?</i>

<p>

<i><b>RESPONSE</b>:  Absolutely not. Neither the House CAREERS
Act, nor the Senate workforce legislation contain any such requirements.
Neither bill mentions &quot;10th grade assessments,&quot; &quot;certificates
of initial mastery,&quot; or &quot;outcome-based education.&quot;
There is no requirement that students be tracked in vocational
or apprenticeship programs, or placed in &quot;youth centers.&quot;</i>

<p><ul>

<b>IV.</b> While CAREERS does not itself include these elements,
how does it guard against them?  This bill <B>will</B> advance
the work of the National Skill Standards Board, promote skill
certificates and certificates of initial mastery and shift American
public education toward a new model -- the <B>German</B> model,
as cited by staff last year.  Proponents of CAREERS have forgotten
that the bill is not entering a void and that implications beyond
its exact language must be considered.

</ul><p>

<i><b>CONCERN</b>: Why are industry-recognized skill standards
referenced in the bill?</i>

<p>

<i><b>RESPONSE</b>: Because the youth title of CAREERS is not
broad education reform -- but is the consolidation and reform
of vocational education and job training programs for drop-outs
and disadvantaged youth -- we found it appropriate to ask that
these programs reflect the skill needs of local employers, so
that such education and training is relevant.  These are young
people who decide they want to get a good job at the end of their
school years (that may very well include postsecondary education
and training)....</i>

<p><ul>

<b>V.(a)</b> To the contrary, it has not been made clear that
the CAREERS bill will not bring broad change to education as a
whole because the term &quot;in-school youth&quot; is not defined
in the bill.  Also, a &quot;comprehensive system of workforce
development and literacy&quot; [Sec. 101, purpose] implies that
it could involve everyone -- in school and out.  State plans must
tell how the academic and occupational skills of youth will be
developed [Sec. 221(1)].  No qualification is made to the term
&quot;youth&quot; in this context, so whether its authors intended
it or not, it is likely that regulation could require the inclusion
of <I><B>all</B></I> youth.

<p>

FRC and other groups have expressed concerns that students not
be steered into vocational fields.  <B>If the rationale for including
youth in this seamless system is to ensure that in-school &quot;programs
reflect the skill needs of local employers,&quot; how will the
steering of students according to employers' needs be avoided?</B>

</ul><p>

<i><b>RESPONSE (cont.):</b> Nothing however, requires States
or localities to use &quot;national&quot; skill standards, established
by the National Skill Standards Board.  There are two references
in the bill to skill standards adopted by the National Skill Standards
Board, and both are <b>voluntary</b>.  Such standards <b>may</b>
be used by States, in determining the performance of adult training
providers.</i>

<p><ul>

<b>V.(b)</b> The point is that CAREERS endorses the federally
funded work of the National Skill Standards Board (that is, creating
a national skill standard system) instead of repealing it.

</ul><p>

<i><b>CONCERN</b>: Will CAREERS require the award of skill certificates?
Can skill certificates be used to replace high school diplomas?
What are skill certificates -- are they same as certificates
of initial mastery?</i>

<p>

<i><b>RESPONSE</b>: Certificates of initial mastery are <b>not</b>
referenced in CAREERS.  Skill certificates are <b>not</b> certificates
of initial mastery.  They do <b>not</b> take the place of a high
school diploma.  Skill certificates are <b>not</b> mandatory in
CAREERS.  Skill certificates are a portable credential that <b>may</b>
be awarded to individuals once they have attained occupational
skills at levels that industry has recognized as necessary to
do a specific job/occupation.  As previously cited, there is language
in the bill that specifically says that nothing in the Act can
be used to require any individual to acquire a skill certificate
or to meet industry-recognized skill standards.  Further, language
was added to the bill clarifying that skill certificates may only
be awarded to youth, <b>in addition to or in combination with
a high school diploma</b> or a G.E.D.  Further, skill certificates
are not imposed upon employers.  In other words, an employers'
use or recognition of skill certificates for purposes of hiring,
is <b>totally voluntary.</b></i>

<p><ul>

<b>VI.</b> In School-to-Work jargon, &quot;certificate of initial
mastery&quot; and &quot;skill certificate&quot; <I><B>are</B></I>
used interchangeably.  State applications for federal School-to-Work
grants alternate between the two terms.

<p>

When government gets involved in the creation of skill standards
and certificates to be considered in hiring, government has the
potential to become gatekeeper to the workforce.  Also, consider
the logic of the national skill standards system, written in law
(Title V of Goals 2000).  Skill certificates are useful only if
they give preference to the people who have them.  There is little
use in having a skill certificate system if it is not universal,
so it is highly unlikely that the system will stay voluntary for
long.  That is why many Americans were looking to this Congress
to <B>uproot</B> the national skill standards system begun under
Goals 2000 and the School-to-Work Opportunities Act of 1994 and
are highly disappointed to see the same elements retrenching in
the form of CAREERS.

</ul><p>

<i><b>CONCERN</b>: Does CAREERS move us toward &quot;dumbing-down&quot;
education in the U.S.?</i>

<p>

<i><b>RESPONSE</b>: No.  One of the few requirements under the
youth component of CAREERS is for the integration of academic,
vocational, and work-based learning.  This is to ensure that vocational
education and training for disadvantaged youth is not &quot;dumbed-down&quot;
-- to ensure that these programs stress academics as well as occupational
learning.  CAREERS also requires that secondary and postsecondary
institutions develop articulation agreements, so that students
in vocational education have access and are encouraged to go on
to postsecondary education.  Nothing in CAREERS discourages independent
achievement.</i>

<p><ul>

<b>VII.</b> Proponents of CAREERS have forgotten that the bill
is not entering a void, but an educational atmosphere of dumbed-down
academics and controversial values.  Mr. Hyde is right to communicate
the concerns of many parents that CAREERS could contribute to
such problems because the school-to-work agenda already in place
has detracted from the academic purpose of schooling.  Again,
it has not been sufficiently proven that CAREERS will be any different,
because its reach into education remains unclear and potentially
extensive.

</ul><p>

<i><b>CONCERN</b>: Does the CAREERS bill result in a &quot;managed
economy&quot; where federal, state, and local workforce boards
will control all job programs through one-stop or integrated career
centers?</i>

<p>

<i><b>RESPONSE</b>: No.  The whole point of the CAREERS bill is
to empower individuals (through vouchers and a competitive system)
to make their own informed career choices, and to assist States
and local communities in making reforms in job training and vocational
education programs to meet individual needs.</i>

<p>

<i>In exchange for billions of dollars in federal funding for
job training and employment assistance, CAREERS does ask States
and localities to establish integrated career center systems --
easily accessible, single points of entry into local employment
and training  programs -- for adults in need of employment assistance
or job training, and for employers who are in need of workers.
The actual design for such systems is left entirely to the
State and local community.  co-located Career centers (some call
them one-stops) are encouraged, not required.  And they are locally-designed,
appointed, and managed -- <b>not federally-run or controlled</b>.</i>

<p><ul>

<b>VIII.</b> The state and local workforce development boards
mentioned in the concern above will not be elected and will therefore
not have to answer to voters.  The boards are charged with developing
a comprehensive education and workforce development system for
their communities.  Since it has not yet been clarified that CAREERS
will not affect all in-school youth, it may be assumed that these
boards will have significant authority over not only labor and
economic issues in their regions, but also over education.  Like
Goals 2000's establishment of appointed school improvement councils
at the state and local levels, such <B>workforce development boards
will take authority away from locally elected bodies such as city
councils and school boards.</B>

</ul><p>

<i><b>CONCERN</b>: Does CAREERS establish &quot;a computer-based
system that will track teachers' training and performance, school
performance, and ...students from pre-kindergarten through technical
training and into the workforce&quot;? Will CAREERS require that
&quot;all information will be made available to interested government
officials and prospective employers&quot;?</i>

<p>

<i><b>RESPONSE</b>: No. The CAREERS bill does <b>not</b> allow
for the collection of private information on any individual --
especially youth.  Protections are included in the bill to address
this concern as follows...

<p><ul>

<li>Specific language restating Title 13 of the Census Act relating
to confidentiality of information was added to the bill prior
to its floor consideration.

<p>

<li>Specific language that states:  &quot;Nothing in this Act
shall violate the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act under
section 249 of the General Education Provisions Act and the privacy
and confidentiality provisions under section 22(b) of Title II
of the Wagner Peyser Act as amended by this Act,&quot; was also
added.

<p>

<li>Language was added requiring that all data collected as part
of the labor market information system be aggregate data from
the census and other public sources -- not personal information.

</ul><p>

<b>Adult Training Performance-based Program Information.</b>
There is language in the bill requiring States to collect performance
data on adult job training providers that want to participate
in the voucher program.  Such performance-based information is
necessary to allow individuals to make their own, informed career
choices.  Submission of such information is voluntary however,
required only if training providers want to receive federally-funded
training vouchers.</i>

<p><ul>

<b>IX.</b> The Labor Market Information System (LMIS)
database of workforce information is to be &quot;<B>comprehensive</B>,&quot;
supplying information on &quot;the socioeconomic characteristics,
and current employment status of the population, including self-employed,
part-time, and seasonal workers, and individuals with severe disabilities&quot;
and &quot;job vacancies&quot; and so on [Title II, Sec. 21-22].

<p>

Combine such an idea with the Smart Cards Gov. Miller boasts of
in Nevada and the Worklink electronic resume in other states --
both of which gather data on school children -- and Americans
are right to be alarmed about the potential for invasion of their
privacy and that of their children.

<p>

Though CAREERS' version of LMIS may not include data that invade
personal privacy, setting up this vast new database system to
be uniform throughout the nation is worrisome.  At any time in
the future, if government should decide to require <b>additional</b>
data on individuals, the LMIS will be at their fingertips.

<p>

LMIS is really a Catch-22.  On the one hand, to provide unique,
powerful data, LMIS would have to threaten personal privacy. 
On the other hand, if it is sufficiently watered down to protect
individuals, LMIS will largely duplicate the type of data already
provided by a number of trade and business sources in the private
sector.  Either way, LMIS should not be a government endeavor.
It's a waste of money.

</ul><p>

<i><b>CONCERN</b>: Will CAREERS require individuals to receive
a government chosen job, or require individuals to receive a government
card in order to obtain and to hold a job?  Would the bill require
employers to list jobs with the labor market information system,
or require employers to hire individuals who have received skill
certificates as a result of job training programs?</i>

<p>

<i><b>RESPONSE</b>: No. The CAREERS bill does not tell individuals
what jobs or careers they must hold.  The bill has no references
to government cards or requirements for employment.  Individuals
have the freedom to select any job or career they want.  In fact,
CAREERS increases this liberty, empowering individuals through
the use of vouchers, to obtain the job training of their choice.
Further, the CAREERS bill does not place any requirements on
employers, for purposes of job listings, or hiring practices.</i>

<p><ul>

<b>X.</b> It bears repeating:  the Labor Market Information
System (LMIS) database of workforce information is to be &quot;comprehensive,&quot;
supplying information on &quot;the socioeconomic characteristics,
and current employment status of the population, including self-employed,
part-time, and seasonal workers, and individuals with severe disabilities&quot;
and &quot;job vacancies&quot; and so on [Title II, Sec. 21-22].
If those aren't requirements of employers, what is?

<p>

If it truly will be voluntary for employers to submit data to
LMIS, why should the government be doing this when the private
sector already provides sufficient labor market information supplied
on a voluntary basis by employers?

<title>CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT: QUESTIONS AND CAVEATS</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">

<p>

<h2>CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT:<br>
QUESTIONS AND CAVEATS</h2></center>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<li><b>Can we expect child support enforcement legislation to
increase child support payments substantially?</b>

<p>

A 1992 General Accounting Office report found that 14 percent
of fathers who owe child support are dead and that 66 percent
&quot;cannot afford to pay the amount ordered&quot; because they
are not employed by legal activity.  Many of these delinquent
fathers are addicts, alcoholics, mental patients, or prison inmates.

<p>

On the other hand, Bill Harrington of the American Fathers' Coalition
reports that only between 5 percent and 10 percent of fathers
are &quot;deadbeats&quot; in the conventional sense, meaning that
they &quot;don't give one penny of support or one minute of their
time.&quot;

<p>

<li><b>Will draconian child support enforcement serve the best
interest of mothers and children?</b>

<p>

In 1989, after passage of the Family Support Act of 1988, about
20 percent of unwed mothers without support awards said that they
did not want awards and another 21 percent did not pursue an award.

<p>

A group of former welfare mothers explained to a reporter (<I>The
New York Times</I>, February 17, 1995) that &quot;they know better
than anybody what will happen if . . . the Government makes fugitives
of men who the women say do not have jobs or money to pay the
child support.  They say it is the children who will suffer for
this, that the men will come after the women and blame or beat
them for the punitive actions of the state.&quot;

<p>

The women in the interview concluded, &quot;The whole [welfare]
system is anti-family, first by keeping the father from the home
and then by pitting mother against father over child support poor
men usually cannot pay. . . .  'My son needs a relationship with
his father,' [one mother] said.  'That has no cash value.'&quot;

<p>

Restoring the fathers' physical presence in children's lives is
in fact the most reliable means of guaranteeing child support.
When fathers do receive visitation, almost 80 percent pay full
child support, on time.  When fathers receive joint custody, the
child support compliance rate exceeds 90 percent.  In studying
the National Longitudinal Surveys of Labor Market Experience, Youth
Cohort (NLSY) data set, economist Robert Lerman found that unwed
fathers who rarely or never visited their children were also the ones 
least likely to pay child support.  Those who later married were 
suddenly motivated to increase their earnings dramatically, even 
without additional job training, according to Lerman.

<p>

<li><b>What is the proper balance between fathers' rights and
responsibilities?</b>

<p>

Under current law, a father's legal rights may be heavily circumscribed
or completely thwarted by the mother's noncooperation.  One study
found that almost half of all mothers interfere even when the
father has won visitation rights.

<p>

Economist and social critic George Gilder describes both the danger
and the futility of increasing welfare mothers' independence at
the expense of fathers' rights.  &quot;Nothing is so futile,&quot;
he writes, &quot;as efforts to force men to support for life a
child they 'father' out of wedlock while abortion laws deny them
any power to determine whether the child is born and while the
welfare regime denies them any economic power to marry the mother.&quot;
The attendant frustration, Gilder warns, increases men's propensity
for violence.

<p>

If unwed fathers are to be legally obligated to pay child support
to women who are on welfare, it seems neither sensible nor equitable
to deny fathers access to the same job training and employment
opportunity programs to which mothers are entitled.

<p>

<li><b>Should the IRS be responsible for enforcing payment of
child support?</b>

<p>

Shifting the responsibility for child support enforcement to the
IRS raises the danger that failure to collect checks from delinquent
fathers will very easily evolve into remitting government checks
instead -- a proposal which has been floated in Congress in the
past.  Enforcement by the IRS is only one small step removed from
exchanging &quot;personal responsibility&quot; for new social
responsibility and from exalting government in place of family.

<p>

<li><b>What principles should be embodied in a positive alternative?</b>

<p>

The problem inherent in child support enforcement is, as social
scientist Charles Murray has said, that &quot;it is next to impossible
for anyone, including the state, to force a man to take on the
responsibilities of fatherhood.&quot;  The best child support
is an intact marriage, and policymakers should seriously consider
restoring the distinctiveness of marriage by making it once again
the sole legal institution through which parental rights and responsibilities
are defined and exercised.

<p>

Experts estimate that 30 to 40 percent of low-income men living
apart from their families still maintain a relationship with them
and that a large percentage of delinquent fathers fail to contribute
child support simply because they have no income.  We should consider
allowing fathers to satisfy the welfare reform work requirements
while mothers care for the children -- a measure that could increase
&quot;child support&quot; by rebuilding spousal interdependence.

<title>HOSPITAL VISITATION: A NON-ISSUE</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">

<p>

<h2>HOSPITAL VISITATION:<br>
A NON-ISSUE</h2></center>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

Homosexual activists often say that a key reason they need same-sex
&quot;marriage&quot; is because they are denied hospital visitation
rights to see their lovers.[1]

<p>

Yet an informal survey of hospitals in the Washington, D.C. area[2]
and elsewhere reveals that no institution bars any visitor that
the patient cares to see.  When asked if a patient had been denied
the right to a visit by a homosexual lover, hospital administrators
responded with incredulity that it was even considered an issue.
None recalled anyone being barred from seeing a patient because
of the visitor's homosexuality.

<p>

Homosexual activists cite a single case in which a lesbian lover
was barred from seeing a disabled patient at a mental hospital
and then at home with the patient's parents because of the wishes
of the patient's family.[3] A Nexis search on July 1, 1996 revealed
no other cases in which a homosexual was barred from visitation
by a family.  Yet homosexual activists give the impression that
the problem is widespread and that the only way to overcome this
barrier is to allow homosexuals to &quot;marry,&quot; thus elevating
them to &quot;family status.&quot;

<p>

The activists also often claim that the patient's family has final
authority in all instances of hospital visitation.  But final
authority most often is the patient, who is permitted to define
the &quot;intimate circle&quot; of visitors.  In fact, patients
routinely see anyone they want.

<p>

Typically, the choice falls to the family only when the patient
is unable to make the decision.  Families rightfully have this
authority, since ties of blood, adoption and genuine marriage
outweigh other types of relationships.  This would apply in cases
where the patient is sedated or unconscious and has not made previous
arrangements (such as a &quot;living will&quot;).  The homosexual
&quot;hospital visitation myth&quot; is derived from such a scenario.

<p>

According to hospital administrators, an unmarried couple, heterosexual
or homosexual, can define their &quot;intimate circle&quot; in
writing in what is called a &quot;proxy.&quot;  That request will
be honored regardless of whether the patient's family agrees.
Patients can also grant power of attorney to homosexual lovers,
giving them legal authority and access equal to that of family.
As far as HIV-infected patients are concerned, courts routinely
have confirmed the visitation rights of  children to see an HIV-infected
parent (in or out of the hospital).[4]

<p>

The only person with higher authority than the patient is the
doctor.  If the doctor believes the presence of a certain person
will adversely affect the patient, then the doctor has the authority
to revoke that person's visitation rights, even if that person
is a family member.

<p>

These policies are not newly instituted concepts but have been
in existence for years.  In rare cases where patients feel they
have been inconvenienced by current policy,  redress is available
through appeal to hospital authorities, local law or through professional
medical associations.

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

The homosexual movement's &quot;hospital visitation hardship&quot;
is an emotional smokescreen without foundation that is being used
to distract from the more serious implications of radically redefining
marriage.

<title>Observations About America's Welfare Crisis</title>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">
<h2>OBSERVATIONS ABOUT<br>
AMERICA'S WELFARE CRISIS</h2>
<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Jennifer E. Marshall</i></center>
<p>
<li><b>On Responsibility.</b> For a man to enjoy freedom,
he must accept responsibility for his own acts.  The failure to
accept responsibility denies man basic human dignity.
<p>
The problem with the welfare system is that it suppresses a sense
of personal responsibility and negates freedom and dignity in
the bargain.
<p>
The system neither demands nor rewards responsible behavior. 
Instead, it pays benefits to those who spurn virtue and, in so
doing, makes a mockery of responsible citizens.
<p>
Franklin D. Roosevelt said that &quot;welfare is a narcotic, a
subtle destroyer of the human spirit,&quot; and Alexander Hamilton
observed that &quot;a power over a man's subsistence amounts to
a power over his will.&quot;
<p>
By creating a culture of dependency, we have reduced a potentially
proud and independent people to passive clients.  We have told
them, not that they are equal to the inevitable challenges of
life, but that they are helpless -- a different, less human kind
of breed than the rest of us who can and do live by the rules.
<p>
Welfare bureaucrats say, &quot;You can't do this.  Let us do it
for you.  And pay us to do it with your vote, year after year.&quot;
 And so we are empowering the bureaucracy at the same time we
are destroying individuals, and children are inheriting not only
material poverty but their parents' poverty of the spirit.
<p>
<li><b>On Compassion.</b> The problem of the 1990s is no
longer &quot;poverty,&quot; but, rather, &quot;dependency.&quot;
 And the problem of dependency is primarily a moral problem.
<p>
Government policy that provides money to the poor, while encouraging
them to act in ways that ensure dependency, is not compassionate.
 That's &quot;compassion&quot; that kills, and even liberals have
begun to see the light.
<p>
In a December 15, 1986 article in <i>The New Republic</i>, liberal
social critic Mickey Kaus admitted that &quot;compassion . . .
is a miserable basis for liberal politics.  It carries the unmistakable
implication of dependence and piteousness on the part of those
on the receiving end of the sentiment. . . .  [I]t provides no
principle to tell us when our abstract compassionate impulses
should stop . . . which is why a politics based on mass-produced
compassion leads naturally to the indiscriminate dispensing of
cash.&quot;
<p>
Compassion instead must be defined as the potential to effect
change in the current system -- because the current system is
synonymous with misery.
<p>
And the principle behind that change must be a new sense of limits,
based on the discrimination between good and bad behavior.
<p>
In her book <i>Poverty and Compassion</i>, Gertrude Himmelfarb
suggested that we must be determined, not just to feel good about
ourselves, but to do good to others.  And sometimes it is necessary
to feel bad ourselves and to curb our run-away compassion, in
order to serve the best interests of others.
<p>
<li><b>On Illegitimacy.</b> Can we doubt that a system
that subsidizes illegitimacy perpetuates illegitimacy -- and creates
social chaos?  Listen to the testimony of one woman on welfare,
quoted in the March 1995 <i>Reader's Digest</i>:  &quot;Welfare
is an enabler.  It's not that you want to be in that situation.
 But it's there.  We always know.&quot;  
<p>
In other words, welfare enables unmitigated disaster -- by making
it increasingly difficult for the poor to make the right choices
which they otherwise are fully capable of making.  
<p>
Welfare destroys individuals first, and then the destruction moves
outward in concentric circles to consume the entire community.
 When illegitimacy reaches a critical mass -- as it already has
in many communities, both black and white -- the neighborhood
effects create problems that extend far beyond the recipients
of welfare.
<p>
Community values and the norms for male
behavior are changed, and with them the behavior of young men
and women who never touch an AFDC check.  Thus, the effect
of those checks springs not only from discrete changes in economic
incentives but from a larger, more pervasive effect on the formation
of character among poor young people.
<p>
Great Society programs shared a common assumption:  that the poor
are victims in the grip of larger forces.  We are all victims
now, of large destructive forces of our own making -- and no one
is more victimized than the poor themselves.
<p>
<li><b>On Family Formation.</b> By subsidizing illegitimacy,
we have turned our inner cities into a wasteland.  And we can't
expect to roll back the tide until we discover some means to ensure
that more children grow up with a father in the home.
<p>
Families socialize children, and persons of a utopian bent of
mind are wrong in thinking that we can replace the family by some
kind of government construct that will accomplish the same ends.
 We have tried that, and we have failed miserably.
<p>
Liberals made their mistake in assuming that virtues like selflessness
and generosity are a part of human nature.  To the contrary, any
right impulse that man possesses must take shape and form within
the family -- or else it will not form at all.
<p>
Even <i>Newsweek</i> has announced that &quot;the name of the
game is shame,&quot; but shame springs up spontaneously only when
children experience loving family relationships that make them
care about how their actions will impact those around them.  Children
who don't feel the love of family can't feel remorse.  They just
feel the pain that inevitably results from violating the laws
of society and of &quot;Nature's God.&quot;
<p>
And so, for the sake of the children, we are justified in taking
whatever means are available to a free people to ensure that intact
families are once again the norm.
<p>
If we don't take action, one of every 2 babies will be born to
a single mother within the next 20 years.  That's a fact we can't
live with.
<P>
<li><b>On Cultural Decline.</b> Peggy Noonan has said that
we have all had a moment when we suddenly realized that the world
was changing before our very eyes -- and not for the better. 
For her, the moment came at a graduation ceremony when the audience
stood up and applauded a senior who would soon give birth to a
baby minus a father.
<p>
Noonan wrote in the September 14, 1992 issue of <i>Forbes</i>:
 &quot;In the sound of that applause I heard a wall falling, a
thousand-year wall, a wall of sanctions that said: We as a society
do not approve of teenaged unwed motherhood because it is not
good for the child, not good for the mother, and not good for
us.&quot;
<p>
What we applaud, we encourage; and we do a grave disservice to
young women and their children when we refuse to draw lines between
right and wrong.
<p>
We can disapprove and yet still provide help -- but we cannot
make that critical distinction by guaranteeing a right to cash
benefits independent of the obligation to good conduct.
<p>
The only real help comes from private individuals and organizations
that sponsor moral renewal at the same time they offer material
support.  Since it's far easier to receive a check in the mail,
no questions asked, welfare denies its dependents the chance to
get real help -- the kind of help that changes lives.
<p>
<li><b>On The Needs of Our Children.</b> James Q. Wilson
said in the 1994 Wriston Lecture at the Manhattan Institute that,
rather than focusing on how to reduce poverty or dependency, we
must set our sights on saving the children.
<p>
We must focus on the dictum that, for a child to thrive, he needs
the &quot;irrational involvement&quot; of two parents who love
him fiercely.
<p>
The problem is that a teenage mother is still a child herself,
with all the distractions and conflicting emotions of adolescence
at play.
<p>
She must contend not only with earaches and two-year-old tantrums,
but with her own broken dreams of any realistic chance at a better
life.
<p>
Three-fourths of illegitimate births among whites alone are to
women with a high school education or less; and, the younger the
single mother, the less likely she is to finish high school.
<p>
The kindest policy we could adopt is one that ensures that young
unwed mothers will have to live either at home with their families
or in group homes.  Not only would the young mother have the help
and supervision of adults on a daily basis, but her child would
be far less likely to suffer abuse or neglect.
<p>
Children born out of wedlock are statistically much more likely
to be abused.  And it is alone at night in an empty apartment
that a tired young mother is most likely to react with anger at
the sound of a crying baby.
<p>
Studies show that the high rate of out-of-wedlock births to young
mothers is the primary explanation for America's low international
standing on measures of infant mortality.
<p>
If we really want to end the suffering of children, we should
end the government subsidies that enable children to bear children.
<P>
<li><b>On Fatherlessness.</b> More than 70% of all juveniles
in state reform institutions come from fatherless homes.  The
likelihood that a young male will engage in criminal activities
doubles if he is raised without a father and triples if he lives
in a neighborhood with a high concentration of single-parent families.
<p>
While shocking, the statistics should not take us completely by
surprise.  Young males are a problematic sex, and they require
socialization that only fathers can provide.
<p>
If not socialized into responsible adult behavior and, as it turns
out, into responsible sexual behavior, young men are dangerous.
 Social scientists are just now beginning to say, in their bloodless
way, what policemen have known for years -- in a <i>not</i> so
bloodless way.
<p>
It is not enough to say that certain kinds of welfare reforms
will cause suffering.  We have to come to terms with the degree
of suffering that's occurring right now.
<p>
And we have to include in the body count the number of children
who fall prey to the violent crime that results from, as James
Q. Wilson put it, &quot;neglecting the processes by which the
underclass reproduces itself.&quot;
<p>
We can maintain our broad legal freedoms -- and our lives -- <i>only</i>
if we manage to instill in our children a degree of self-restraint.
 And we can cultivate that restraint only by turning the hearts
of the fathers to the children.
<p>
<li><b>On Building Community.</b> The welfare system does
not represent the intended relation of free and equal citizens.
 In fact, welfare practically precludes <i>any</i> relationship
between rich and poor.
<p>
Benefit checks amount to essentially tribute money.  In exchange
for our money, we ask that the poor simply leave us alone.
<p>
We hope that the state will make them comfortable, but the paying
of checks by an impersonal bureaucracy requires no personal
involvement on our part.
<p>
Do we realize the implications?
<p>
We have reinstituted segregation -- though not along lines of
race -- because the underclass culture fosters alienation.  Already
we are divided by the distance between &quot;middle-class&quot;
values and the moral anarchy of the inner city, and we will find
it increasingly appealing to create a modern analogue of the Indian
reservation to house the people we fear.
<p>
Our hope lies in the private transactions in which we meet individuals
in need of help, not as clients, but as fellow human beings. 
Tocqueville explained: &quot;Private charity establishes valuable
ties between the rich and the poor by involving the giver in the
fate of the one whose poverty he has undertaken to alleviate.
 Although divided by circumstance, they are willingly reconciled.&quot;
<p>
This is a country badly in need of healing, not of new and deeper
divisions.  But we will have to change welfare if we want to stymie
the secession of the poor from middle-class life -- and from the
common experience of freedom, as the Founders meant it.

<title>THE LEGACY OF THE NEW JERSEY FAMILY CAP</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">
<h2>THE LEGACY OF THE NEW JERSEY<br>
FAMILY CAP:</h2>
<h4>A BLUEPRINT FOR THE STATES</h4></center>
<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<center><i>by<br>
Jennifer E. Marshall</i></center>
<p>
When the states begin to reassess welfare policy in the wake of
new federal legislation, the defining issue will be the family
cap.  A well-rounded debate over the family cap will ask and answer
fundamental questions about the future of social policy in a post-entitlement
world -- and few questions beg right answers quite so urgently.
<p>
A modest first step, the family cap would simply deny an increase
in the AFDC cash benefits to mothers who bear additional children
while on welfare.  The &quot;restriction&quot; is scant in proportion
to the scale of devastation wrought by open-ended checks.
<p>
In many instances, those checks have reduced the birth father
to no more than a passing stranger, and marriage is teetering
on the brink of anachronism in communities with a high concentration
of welfare recipients.  To the extent that the state provides
ready alternatives, marriage, work, and self-sufficiency will
inevitably seem a little less hallowed, a little less than necessary.
<p>
The purpose of the family cap is, not to reduce births per se,
but to restore a sense of personal responsibility by insisting
that families on welfare live by the same values and confront
exactly the same choices as the general population.  The working
poor, for example, receive no increase in salary when another
child is added to the family.  Lowering our expectations of a
woman on welfare and the father of her child is no different from
lowering our estimation of their capability -- implying that they
are a different, less human kind of breed than the rest of us
who can and do live by the rules.
<p>
In his 1988 book <I>In Pursuit of Happiness and Good Government</I>,
Charles Murray argues that self-respect is an essential human
need and that the threshold condition for self-respect is accepting
responsibility for one's own life.  Self-determination must be
authentic, however.  An &quot;as if&quot; condition does not suffice.
Thus, Murray concludes, &quot;self-respect is not within the gift of any 
government or any policy. . . .  The only thing that government can do is
provide an environment within which people can earn their self-respect&quot;[1]
by earning their own way in the world.  If children are suffering
because parents are irresponsible, no amount of government money
can allay the suffering -- because the parents will still be irresponsible.
<p>
But Murray also defines self-respect as &quot;measuring up to
internalized standards of what it means to be a full-fledged member
of the community.&quot;[2] Government policy that dumbs down the
standards for welfare recipients so that &quot;measuring up&quot;
no longer has any content, or makes any economic sense, does violence
to the human spirit.  It's also singularly unjust.  Women on welfare
should have equal opportunity to follow the playbook that for
centuries has been the surest guarantor of human happiness.  What
Edmund Burke wrote long ago is even more true today: &quot;We
know that we have made no discoveries, and we think that no discoveries
are to be made, in morality.&quot;  Yet, we perpetuate a welfare
system that makes it harder for men and women to pursue virtuous
living.
<p>
Arguments against the current system rest not on value premises
exclusively but on empirical fact, confirmed by social science
data, that adult satisfaction depends on earning one's own way
and that children's well-being depends critically on a stable
family life.[3]  A proper concept of justice places a premium, not
on securing any particular material result, but on upholding the
social agreement that men and women work for their bread and wait
to bear children until they are emotionally and financially able
to provide for their support.  Certainly, we should question the
justice of requiring working men and women to uphold the rules
while spending their hard-earned tax dollars to subsidize the
systematic violation of those rules.
<p>
The central problem with the welfare system is that it deranges
social expectations regarding work and marriage by turning nature's
rewards and penalties on end.  Asserting that everyone possesses
moral autonomy is not the same as asserting that everyone possesses
equal capacity to sort through the mixed signals of a policy that
obliterates natural consequences and denies virtue its full reward
by making crimes against the social compact pay.
<p>
Again, however, the argument for the family cap rests, not on
value premises alone, but on certain assumptions about human nature
and social causation that are empirically verifiable.  And the
most recent data from New Jersey's experiment with the family
cap provide powerful evidence that proponents of the cap are indeed
correct in their assumptions.
<p>
In the sixteen months after the family cap took effect in August
of 1993, the average monthly birth rate for women on AFDC in New
Jersey declined by 10 percent or more -- a durable, sizable, and
real reduction in the birth rate.[4] When the denominator is restricted
to women of childbearing age (15-45 years old), whose youngest
child is at least 10 months old and who have been on AFDC for
at least 12 months, the reported birth rate decreased by 17.6
percent over the 12-month period immediately following implementation
of the Family Development Program (FDP).[5]
<p>
While the time series data is significant, the most interesting
piece of evidence to date surfaced in a memo leaked to the press
from the formal evaluation study at Rutgers University.  According
to the memo, the Rutgers study has found no significant difference
in the rate of births to women in the &quot;experimental&quot;
group, who are subject to the restriction on additional cash benefits,
and women in the &quot;control&quot; group, who are exempt from
the cash limitation.
<p>
<b>Contrary to press reports, the null difference between the
experimental and control birth rates does NOT imply that the cap
has had no impact on births to AFDC women.  The correct explanation
for the null difference is that births dropped within both groups
after the new policy took effect.  The family cap, in other words,
has had an even larger and more dramatic impact on births than
expected.[6]</b>
<p>
Explaining the scope of that effect is an exercise in charting
a much broader agenda for political and cultural reform.  While
the family cap is no panacea, it is a critical first step that
logically implies both the destination desired and the reforms
that will be required -- to renew the ethic of individual responsibility
and personal compassion that will restore moral authority to the
Founders' notion of liberty.  The logic of the family cap insists
that relimiting government is itself a moral imperative.
<p>
The most plausible explanation for the success of the New Jersey
cap is that the change in policy sent a clear moral signal that
was at least as important an aspect of the &quot;treatment&quot;
as the restriction on cash benefits.  Dr. Rudy Myers of the New
Jersey Department of Human Services explains:
<p><blockquote>
[T]he treatment in FDP [New Jersey's Family Development Program]
is <I>not </I>a matter of whether or not the AFDC grant is increased
with the birth of the additional child, but is, rather, a matter
of whether or not the individual is exposed to the public publicity
itself -- e.g., newspapers, conversations at the Laundromat, talk
radio, etc.  Suffice it to say that it is extremely implausible
that anyone living in New Jersey for the past several years has
<I>not </I>been exposed to the &quot;family cap&quot; policy.
 &quot;Policy&quot; here cannot be restricted to meaning simply
the law about the family cap; it is the entire line of reasoning
about issues of personal and family responsibility, fairness to
working taxpayers, [and] the rational approach to self-sufficiency.[7]
</blockquote><p>
Because the public discussion of the ideas and values motivating
the law reached women in both the &quot;treatment&quot; and &quot;control&quot;
groups, Dr. Myers concludes that the control group condition cannot
be considered a reasonable proxy for eliminating the effect of
the cap altogether.
<p>
Contrary to liberal rhetoric about the &quot;punitive&quot; nature
of the cap, the success of the New Jersey policy rests on the
power of social persuasion.  The $44 benefit increase eliminated
by the family cap constituted only 4 percent of the total monthly
welfare benefits received by the average AFDC mother in New Jersey.[8]
Those who cry &quot;social engineering&quot; should bear in mind
that the cash limitation itself merely restores government neutrality
after a long interlude of active government favoritism to out-of-wedlock births. 
Women are free to bear as many children as they wish, at their own expense. 
A law with as modest an economic disincentive as the New Jersey
cap almost certainly derives its force from new moral sanctions
against illegitimate childbearing and other personal failings.
<p>
Critics of the cap now question whether a public relations campaign
promoting personal responsibility could be sufficiently forceful
to obviate the need for changes in current welfare policy.  Those
critics forget that laws are indeed moral signaling devices, that
policies cannot belie principles, and that governments cannot
instill a sense of responsibility <I>and </I>provide material
support at the same time.  A public relations campaign is not
sufficient precisely because welfare obviates the need for personal
responsibility and because the &quot;as if&quot; condition, Charles
Murray discovers, does not hold.
<p>
The family cap may be less important than the shift in social
norms that it reflects, but it is a prerequisite for real reform
because it reconciles the current tension between moral knowledge
and the perverse economic incentives of welfare.  The family cap
is an indictment, not of welfare recipients, but of the welfare
system itself.  Illegitimacy, for example, used to be controlled
in large part by the natural economic consequences, until the
economics of welfare intervened to blunt the effect.  Policymakers
will find it impossible to reaffirm a family's ability to meet
their own needs, or even to insist that parenting is a fundamental
and enduring responsibility, without reversing the economic signals
that have sent the opposite message for the last 30 years.  Economic
disincentives to virtue ultimately derange social expectations
so that morality itself no longer has meaning.
<p>
While the family cap will be a necessary first step, by no means
will it prove sufficient to reverse the damage.  Policymakers
should move quickly to terminate cash benefits to unwed minor
mothers and to provide a refundable tax credit to married couples
with children when at least one spouse is employed.  Both policy
recommendations address powerful economic disincentives to marriage
left intact by an exclusive focus on the family cap.  Proactive
measures to encourage family formation, like a tax credit for
adoption expenses, are strongly advisable as well.
<p>
Yet, New Jersey's experiment with the cap demonstrates that the
solution cannot rest entirely with the welfare system or with
new legislation.  Even with the family cap in place, yielding
surprisingly strong results, roughly 10 percent of the state's
unwed welfare mothers continue to bear children each year.[9] If
the family cap derives its power from a larger cultural context,
publicizing the moral reasoning behind the change in law, clearly
all institutions in the community must redouble their efforts
to send strong, unequivocal messages advocating personal and parental
responsibility.
<p>
Perhaps the most compelling argument for the cap is that it is
a symbolic first attempt to begin scaling back the government
programs that have eroded the strength of character-forming institutions
-- the family, the church, the school -- by negating their function.
 An astute Frenchman by the name of Tocqueville identified the
fatal error in policies that seek to take the trouble out of living by 
supplanting voluntary arrangements. &quot;The power of the state,&quot; 
he wrote, &quot;would resemble parental authority if, fatherlike, it tried to 
prepare its charges for a man's life, but on the contrary, it only tries to keep 
them in perpetual childhood.&quot;
<p>
It is time to acknowledge that public policy can undermine, but
never instill, virtue and that restoring the concept of responsibility
implies new obligations, not only for welfare recipients, 
but for members of the middle and upper classes too.  Unless neighbors
are once again moved to trouble over each other, the behavioral
poverty of the underclass will only continue to grow more acute,
jeopardizing personal freedoms and ultimately the survival of
the republic itself.  Children must grow to appreciate what is
great and good in order to make good use of liberty; and even
parents depend on the interplay of thoughtful neighbors to help
pattern right habits of the heart.
<p>
Politicians, for their part, can create the enabling conditions
that foster strong families and communities.  And in addition
to cutting government programs, policymakers should revise the
tax code to encourage charitable giving.  States should also consider
designing executive measures like the Faith and Families program
Governor Fordice has implemented in Mississippi to help speed
the replacement of state solutions by strong civil institutions.[10]
<p>
Ultimately, however, politicians will be dependent on the quiet
saints who man soup kitchens and staff maternity homes to inspire
moral renewal in our land -- to teach man to defend liberty more
for the love of virtue and charity than as a claim of  right or
an end in itself.
<p>
The fate of our experiment with self-government will depend upon
our ability to renew a sense of responsibility across all income
classes, along with a renewed commitment to our Founding Fathers'
faith that all men are created equal to live up to those responsibilities.
<p>
At stake is the future of freedom, but also morality, community,
and family -- all of which depend critically on the preservation
of liberty.  Living in the afterglow of new federal welfare legislation
that has ended the entitlement status of welfare, we would do
well to remember that freedom itself <i>is</i> an entitlement
owed every man by virtue of his birth.

<title>THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT: A SOCIAL WORKER'S VIEW</title>

<h2>THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT:<br>
A SOCIAL WORKER'S VIEW</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by<br>
Brenda Destro, D.S.W.</center>

<p>

This speech was presented at a July 2, 1996 Capitol Hill briefing
regarding the Defense of Marriage Act.  The briefing was sponsored
by the Family Research Council.</i>

<p>

Good morning.  Today, I would like to discuss the following points:

<p><ul>

<li>Those who advance an agenda of homosexual rights and same-sex
relationships have shown little regard for the developmental needs
of preteens and teens.

<p>

<li>It is most evident in the design of sex education curricula
offered to 10- to 18-year-olds in most public schools throughout
our country.

<p>

<li>The subject of homosexuality, along with other topics, is
included in most sex education curricula more as the &quot;politically
correct&quot; thing to do, and not balanced with the cognitive,
emotional, social, and moral, needs of the children who participate
with harmful results.

<p>

<li>As homosexuality and same-sex relationships are further sanctioned,
then these topics will be given even greater recognition and a
higher profile in sex ed curricula.  This will result in more
harm, unless more recognition is given to teenage developmental
issues.

</ul><p>

Sex education contains many delicate and controversial topics,
such as homosexuality and same-sex relationships, which are not
presented with a lot of consideration to the developmental needs
of preteens/teens.  This puts these children at risk of problems
ranging from developmental delay to more serious emotional problems
or even physical harm.

<p>

Developmental theorists, such as Piaget, Erikson, Kohlberg, and
even Freud believe that there are distinct differences in personality,
in thinking, in socialization, and in morality among children
and adults of different ages.  The pattern by which each of us
goes through these stages is an individual, interrelated, and
interdependent process.  For the most part, each of us acquires
skills in a sequential manner.  Moving into one stage requires
the completion of the previous stage.  And, the absence of certain
skills, makes the learning of new 
behaviors much harder.  Most school curricula is designed around
the theories of Piaget, and to a lesser degree Erikson and Kohlberg.

<p>

Before I discuss the issue of homosexuality, let me give another
example of a less controversial topic in sex ed that is usually
presented in a manner that is not consistent with cognitive development
or the learning capabilities of preteens and teens:  decision-making.
Many sex ed curricula teach decision-making to children, ages
10-18, so that they make appropriate choices regarding their sexual
behavior.  They learn a model that helps them identify a problem,
develop options, assess options, and then make a decision.  Although
my first reaction, along with many parents, was that this is a
good thing for preteens and teens to learn, there is a problem.
Many preteens and teens are not able to think ahead, assess risk,
or fully consider the feelings of others.  Instead, they are more
likely to be self-centered, idealistic, present-oriented, and
impulsive.  The result is that these kids may be able to memorize
or learn the elements of a d-m model, but they are not likely
to use it.

<p>

But the problem is more serious than a teen or preteen not using
a d-m model.  It is a problem of expecting preteens and teens
to act like adults, when they should be acting like teens.  As
much as none of us like it, teens are supposed to be self-centered,
idealistic, and grounded in the present.  These characteristics
provide protection for the teen who is in the process of experimenting
with new ideas and behaviors.  Ultimately, they make mistakes,
but hopefully they learn from these mistakes.  It is much easier
to brush off mistakes when you are self-centered, present-oriented,
and oblivious to consequences.  The role of parents and adults
is to provide a structure that allows the teen to experiment consistent
with their capabilites, and then to be available to help them
learn from the experience.  What is taught in sex ed asks a child
to skip an important stage and try to make critical decisions
without the skills and guidance needed.  This expectation can
and does lure preteens and teens into high risk situation that
are beyond their current capabilities, placing them at risk of
an unwanted pregnancy or even AIDS.  What is needed is for the
child to experiment on a more gradual basis that does not overwhelm
them.  They should experiment, first, with safer tasks and gradually
learn to handle more risk, and always with the guidance of a parent
or other caring adult.

<p>

In the case of learning about homosexuality and same-sex relationships,
the potential for harm also exists.  These are topics that are
now commonly found in sex ed curricula offered through most junior
high and high schools as a result of the growing debate about
homosexuality.  But, as it's being taught, many of these teens
and preteens are entering a phase in their psychosocial development
where it is characteristic for a girls to have one close girlfriend
and boys to have one close boyfriend.  This is an important phase
in learning emotional intimacy that is critical to forming healthy
relationships.  Yet, there is no distinction made between the
two events in the sex ed curricula.

<p>

All of us, as children first learn emotional intimacy or closeness
in the family as we bond with mother, father, siblings, etc. 
As we reach puberty, we begin to reach outside the family to form
similar bonds with friends of the same sex, and then with groups
of friends of both sexes.  A healthy level of intimacy beomes
an important element of romantic relationships and sexual relationships
in marriage.  This process for the most part occurs in a sequential
fashion.  At each stage the child learns a new level of emotional
intimacy or closeness, if the child has acquired the necessary
skills in a non-threatening and non-sexual environment.  If they
skip a stage or experience a crisis in a stage, the negative aspects
of the stage will predominate making it difficult to handle the
tasks of the next stage.  One way to alleviate the problems is
to go back to that stage and complete the tasks.

<p>

So what happens to the preteens and teens who receive information
about homosexuality and same sex marriages at the same time that
they are bonding with their friends, around the ages of 11 to
14.  Probably for most preteens and teens, they is no harm because
of the support they have from family and friends who can help
them distinguish between the two events.  But for many children
with family or personal problems and no one to turn to for help,
there may be confusion.  That confusion can turn to a fear that
they may be homosexual, when they are not.  They may then turn
away from their friends and interrupt an important developmental
process.  In some cases, because of the confusion about this topic,
well-meaning but misguided counselors would even have these children
believe that they are homosexual, when they are not even sexually
mature.

<p>

As the debate continues and homosexuality and same-sex marriages
gain legitimacy, I foresee these topics gaining greater visibility
in sex ed curricula.  If it is not presented in the best interests
of children, but rather in the best interest of the homosexual
rights movement, there is potential for more harm.

<p>

Thank you.

<title>WELFARE REFORM AND ILLEGITIMACY</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">

<h2>WELFARE REFORM AND<br>
ILLEGITIMACY</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<h4>Written Testimony submitted by Gary L. Bauer<br>
to the<br>
United States House of Representatives<br>
Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources<br>
March 12, 1996</h4></center>

<p>

In the welfare debate last year, President Clinton himself stated
that &quot;the real source of [the] problem is the inordinate
number of out-of-wedlock births in this country.&quot;[1] He also
conceded that &quot;there's no question that [ending welfare for
unwed mothers] would work. The question is... 'Is it morally
right?'&quot;[2]

<p>

While the President's proposed policies leave much to be desired,
he has formulated precisely the right question to frame the current
debate over welfare reform in general and illegitimacy in particular.
There can be no more important policy objective than the preservation
-- or more properly in this day and age, the revitalization --
of our nation's moral capital.  As James Q. Wilson wrote in his
oft-cited article, &quot;The Rediscovery of Character: Private
Virtue and Public Policy&quot;:

<p><blockquote>

<i>The essential first step is to acknowledge that at root, in
almost  every area of  important public concern, we are seeking
to induce  persons to act virtuously....Not only is such conduct
desirable in  its own right, it appears now to be necessary if
large improvements  are to be made in those matters we consider
problems.</i>[3]

</blockquote><p>

There exists a striking public consensus that the welfare state's
practice of subsidizing illegitimacy is not only a massive problem,
but a moral problem at root.

<p>

Even so unlikely a source as Bruce Reed, President Clinton's leading
aide on welfare reform, once acknowledged that the essential purpose
of reform must be to reverse the alarming rise in out-of-wedlock
births.[4] If not driven exclusively by AFDC &quot;benefits,&quot;
the increase has at least been sustained and perpetuated by the
expansion of a system that pays recipients to bear illegitimate
children.  Current trends indicate that by the year 2015 -- some
studies project as early as 2000 -- one of every two American
babies will be born to a single mother, and illegitimacy will
surpass divorce as the main cause of fatherlessness.

<p>

Already, according to the Census Bureau, approximately one of
every three babies born in the United States is born to a single
mother.  In the black inner city, more than 80 percent of children
are born without fathers.  In many poor white communities, the
figure is nearing 50 percent -- and illegitimacy is increasing
more rapidly among whites than any other racial group.  Illegitimacy
ratios for the country's white population have now climbed higher
than the illegitimacy ratios in the black community that compelled
Senator Moynihan to issue his famous warning about the breakdown
of the black family.

<p>

Even if a job program can succeed in putting more unmarried welfare
mothers to work (which is unlikely),[5] we will still be left with
roughly the same number of fatherless children.  While Great Britain
has already succeeded in implementing reforms that make work economically
more attractive than welfare, the reforms of the 1980s have only
served to underscore in both Britain and America the fact that
little progress can be made without addressing the collapse of
the family.[6]

<p>

When the Moynihan Report appeared over thirty years ago, liberal
intellectuals excoriated the author for &quot;defending middle-class
values.&quot;  &quot;What may seem to be a disease to the white
middle class may be a healthy adaptation to the Negro lower class,&quot;
Bayard Rustin intoned.[7] Today, however, overwhelming empirical
evidence demonstrates that there is nothing at all &quot;healthy&quot;
about the decay of families and that not all personal choices
are equal in terms of their impact on children, families, and
communities.  The evidence itself has propelled illegitimacy to
the forefront of the current national debate over welfare reform
-- or at least, <I>had</I> propelled illegitimacy to the forefront
before President Clinton and the Governors signaled their retreat.

<p>

Retreat is inexcusable, for the fact remains that intact families
bestow upon individuals and communities advantages that simply
come no other way.  We cannot repeat too often, in a climate rife
with attempts to seize the moral high ground, that no moral judgment
even need be adduced.  The empirical evidence amassed by social
scientists in the last 10 years (and chronicled by Barbara Dafoe
Whitehead in her April 1993 <I>Atlantic</I> article, &quot;Dan
Quayle Was Right&quot;) has confirmed in exquisite detail what
those who have lived in broken families already know.  A single
woman with children is not a viable economic unit for the vast
majority, but children need biological fathers for much more than
the extra dollars they add to the family budget.  As social scientist
Charles Murray has written, single parenthood is &quot;damaging
to children in so many ways that to list them individually would
be to trivialize them.&quot;[8]

<p>

<I>Children born to single mothers are more likely to experience
abuse or neglect; and they have higher infant mortality rates
and lower birth weights regardless of the age or race of the mother</I>.
The proportion of low birth-weight babies, for example, increases
by 50 percent if the mother is not married.  Dr. Nicholas Eberstadt,
author of &quot;Why Babies Die in D.C.&quot; (<I>The Public Interest,
</I> Spring 1994), observes that &quot;so substantial are the differentials
associated with illegitimacy that an American baby born to a teenage
mother is less likely to register low birth weight if the
mother is married and black than if she is unmarried but white.&quot;[9]
In the early 1980s, black and white babies alike were less likely
to survive the first year of life born to an unmarried college
graduate than to a married high school dropout.[10]

<p>

For those children born out-of-wedlock who do survive, long-term
life prospects are equally discouraging.  According to data from
the National Fatherhood Initiative, only 4.4 percent of children
who live with both parents are expelled or suspended from school.
By contrast, 15.5 percent of fatherless children will be dismissed
or suspended.  Among children living with a never-married mother,
29.7 percent repeat a grade in school as opposed to 11.6 percent
of children overall.  And a 1988 University of Illinois study
of adults born outside of marriage found that the longer the time
spent in a single-parent family, the less education the child
ultimately attained -- regardless of the parent's income level.

<p>

Children born out-of-wedlock also have greater problems with behavioral
development.  The National Survey of Children found that children
from single-parent families are two to three times more likely
to have emotional problems -- three times as likely to find themselves
in psychotherapy.  Lack of self-control is a common failing.

<p>

Not surprisingly, Charles Murray has concluded that &quot;illegitimacy
is the single most important social problem of our time...because
it drives everything else.&quot;[11] According to the Bureau of
Justice Statistics, more than 70 percent of all juveniles in state
reform institutions come from fatherless homes.  Raymond A. Knight
and Robert A. Prentky have reported in the journal <I>Criminal
Justice Behavior</I> that 60 percent of all violent rapists who
were repeat offenders came from single-parent households.  And
a Michigan State University study reported in 1987 in <I>Behavioral
Sciences and the Law</I> found that 75 percent of the adolescent
murderers surveyed had come from homes where the parents were
divorced or never married. <I>The relationship between crime
and one-parent families is so powerful, in fact, that controlling
for family structure erases the relationship between crime and
race and between crime and low income</I>.

<p>

Compounding the cycle of despair, illegitimacy feeds itself too.
Young white women who grow up without a father in the home are
more than twice as likely to bear children out-of-wedlock and
to do so during their teenage years when they are most likely
to form long-term attachments to AFDC.[12] Research by the Heritage
Foundation, based on the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth,
found that young girls raised in single-parent homes in public
housing are roughly five times more likely to bear children out-of-wedlock
themselves than girls raised in two-parent homes.[13]

<p>

If those on the welfare rolls have suffered most conspicuously,
it is also true that the welfare system has corrupted the ideals
and narrowed the vision of many who live well beyond the bounds
of the inner city -- even as it is now threatening our most cherished
civic institutions.  One obvious casualty is the weakening of
our conviction that the so-called &quot;bourgeois virtues&quot;
are available to all, regardless of race or class.  Early American
social workers, like Mary Ellen Richmond, understood the importance
of middle-class norm-setting.  &quot;The way to reintegrate the
deviant into society,&quot; she argued, &quot;is to educate and
indeed direct them toward the shared values of the mainstream
culture.&quot;[14]

<p>

The role of the traditional two-parent family is essential in
sustaining the institutions of a free society precisely because
it is the vehicle by which values are transmitted from generation
to generation.  If the family fails to impart virtues that temper
and restrain behavior, broad legal freedoms must give way.  So,
too, human dignity and equality, as the Founders understood them.
Virtue, historian Gertrude Himmelfarb has said, is the only true
basis of equality and the only requisite for citizenship.[15] As
Charles Murray made clear in his now famous op-ed, &quot;The Coming
White Underclass,&quot; either we act now to reduce illegitimacy
and to reinfuse our public policy with a commitment to higher
and nobler things -- or we run the risk of sabotaging the entire
experiment in democratic self-government.

<p>

Or, as Michael Novak put it:

<p><blockquote>

<i>[T]he project of self-government depends on the capacity of
citizens to govern their own  passions, urges, habits, and expectations.
If they cannot govern their own lives  individually, how can
they be successful in self-government as a republic?  The project
of self-government is moral -- or not at all.</i>[16]

</blockquote><p>

The Founding Fathers and many succeeding generations understood
that only a virtuous people can be free.  Do we?

<p>

Given the consequences for the individual child, the surrounding
community, and the national polity, bringing a baby into this
world without a sense of sacred responsibility cannot long be
regarded as a morally neutral act.  In a report issued in December
1994, the Progressive Policy Institute, policy arm of the Democratic
Leadership Council, joined others in acknowledging that &quot;it
is wrong -- not simply foolish or impractical -- for women and
men to make babies they cannot support emotionally and financially.&quot;[17]
Donna Shalala made the same concession a year earlier, however
reluctantly, when she said in an interview, &quot;I don't like
to put this in moral terms, but I do believe that having children
out-of-wedlock is wrong.&quot;[18]

<p>

Congress should now recognize that it is also wrong to sanction
such activity by subsidizing it.  Republican strategist Bill Kristol
has said that &quot;neither our politics nor our sociology can
ultimately be neutral as to the content of the laws of Nature
and Nature's God,&quot;[19] chief among which is the fact that we
were made to live in families.  Charles Murray asks rhetorically,
&quot;If a social policy that induces people to believe that they
are not responsible for their lives is one that
inhibits the pursuit of happiness and is to that extent immoral[,]
[c]an then a policy that <b>fails</b> to stigmatize be a moral
one?&quot;[20]

<p>

Historical experience, related by Marvin Olasky and others, does
indeed demonstrate that the most effective social services have
been offered by private community groups, without any illusion
of moral neutrality.  In her seminal historical study <I>Poverty
and Compassion</I>, Gertrude Himmelfarb writes that:

<p><blockquote>

<i>[a]fter making the most arduous attempt to objectify the problem
of poverty, to divorce  poverty from any moral assumptions and
conditions, we are learning how inseparable the  moral and material
dimensions of that problem are.  And after trying to devise social
policies that are scrupulously neutral and value-free, we are
finding these policies fraught  with moral implications that have
grave material and social consequences.</i>[21]

</blockquote><p>

George Liebmann says, more simply, in a recent issue of <I>The
American Enterprise</I>, &quot;Rescuing an underclass is by definition
a highly moralistic undertaking.&quot;[22] While controlling welfare
spending is a happy byproduct of terminating benefits to teen
mothers, even more promising is the opportunity to begin reversing
the message of the counterculture that has so eroded the character
of our people, in part by assaulting the family.

<p>

Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan has used the phrase &quot;defining
deviancy down&quot; to describe Americans' tendency to ignore
excess levels of deviancy by normalizing what used to be considered
pathology.  Only by &quot;defining deviancy down&quot; have we
been able to ignore until now all the signs of impending disaster
that attend a burgeoning illegitimacy rate.  Barbara Whitehead's
1993 <I>Atlantic</I> article heralded a real and significant change
in the public mood, however; and the near-mythic ascendancy of
Charles Murray's &quot;Coming White Underclass&quot; piece the
same year seemed to confirm a general convergence of public opinion.
In a recent Family Research Council survey of 1,000 Americans,
a substantial majority (81 percent) of respondents indicated that
&quot;women having babies out of wedlock that they can't support
financially&quot; is a serious problem.  The mounting public consensus
presents a unique opportunity to implement more than symbolic
change in the 104th Congress and to make sanctions against illegitimacy
the focus of that change.

<p>

In sending his welfare package to Congress more than 30 years
ago, President Kennedy articulated contemporary liberals' fundamental
misunderstanding of the causal role welfare plays in boosting
illegitimacy rates.  He said:

<p><blockquote>

<i>[W]elfare programs must contribute to the attack on . . . family
breakdown [and]  illegitimacy. . . . Unless such problems are
dealt with effectively, they fester, and grow, sapping the strength
of society as a whole and extending their consequences in troubled
families from one generation to the next.</i>[23]

</blockquote><p>

Kennedy's insight about the consequences has proven historically
accurate, but his &quot;service&quot; approach to curbing illegitimacy
worked no better than the current President's will -- a fact which
an unnamed aide on the Clinton welfare task force acknowledged
last year.

<p>

While the President advocates a massive and expensive public relations
campaign against teen pregnancy, the anonymous aide confided to
<I>Newsweek</I> reporter Joe Klein: &quot;We looked at a hundred
different programs around the country that were trying to deal
with this problem, and not one of them moved the needle.  There
just weren't any results.&quot;[24] Likewise, a formal study of
the Teenage Parent Demonstration, sponsored by the Department
of Health and Human Services in response to &quot;persistently
high rates of teenage pregnancies and births,&quot; found that
&quot;[t]he program had an unusual and disappointing pattern of
impacts on pregnancy and birth rates . . . despite . . . the substantial
efforts of the programs to empower [the] young mothers to take
control of their fertility.&quot;[25]

<p>

Out-of-wedlock births, moreover, remain a strong predictor of
poverty.  A recent U.S. Census Bureau report on poverty found
that the median household income for women householders with no
husband present is only $19,872.  For black Americans, the median
single-parent household -- which now represents the family structure
of 48 percent of all black families -- is less than $12,000 per
year.  Married black families, by contrast, receive a median income
of $45,041.  Both Republican William Bennett and Democrat William
Galston have noted that, according to the Census Bureau, the family
income of black, two-parent families is almost two-and-a-half
times the family income of white single-parent families.  Children
of white, single parents are two-and-a-half times likelier to
be living in poverty than children in black, two-parent families.
Today's major economic indicator, in other words, is family stability
-- not race.

<p>

In a meticulously researched article in the January 6, 1996 issue
of <I>World</I> magazine, Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation
demonstrates that it is neither easy to raise family income through
welfare transfers nor historically true that higher welfare benefits
and broadened eligibility have improved children's life prospects.
It <I>is</I> true, however, that unwed mothers are not only more
likely to rely on government to support their children, but are
also more likely to spend years dependent upon welfare.  Because
illegitimacy feeds both poverty and itself, we cannot reasonably
expect to address welfare dependency until we address illegitimacy.

<p>

Charles Murray anticipated the problem in his 1988 book <I>In
Pursuit of Happiness and Good Government.</I>  &quot;The task,&quot;
he concludes, &quot;is not to devise a public relations campaign
to discourage single teenage girls from having babies, but to
neutralize whatever is impeding the age-old impulse of human beings
to form families.&quot;[26] Eliminating grants to unwed teenage
mothers will be necessary, but not sufficient, to restore the
integrity of the family unit.

<p>

The primary argument is <I>not</I> that women have babies just
to get the dollars -- although anecdotal evidence does exist to
suggest that welfare checks can drive fertility directly.  There
is the story of a five-month-old girl named Ariel Hill who was born 
on Christmas Eve 1992 and died a brutal death in May of 1993. She lived 
with her 22-year-old mother and four other siblings in a squalid unit
of public housing.  The family's chief source of income was welfare.
One day, her mother grew tired of her screaming and dumped her
in a sink of scalding water as punishment.  She died, weighing
less than seven pounds.  She had not been fed in days.  When investigators
examined the apartment, they found a scrap of paper with the name
of each child and the dollar amount of welfare that child earned
for the mother.

<p>

In all probability, however, Ariel Hill's mother is an aberration.
The chief concern is simply that welfare <I>enables</I> men and
women to indulge in irresponsible behavior by shielding them from
the natural economic consequences of their actions -- actions
that often do issue in tragic results for the children who are
born of their thoughtlessness.  &quot;By lessening the costs attached
to unwed reproduction,&quot; anthropologist David Murray argues,
&quot;welfare subsidizes choices that interfere with future opportunity.
. . .  A monthly increase in cash is usually not enough to 'cause'
someone to bear a child.  But by increasing the benefits and reducing
the burdens of a choice that is desirable on other grounds, welfare
becomes a catalyst in the timing and frequency of the decision.
How could it be otherwise?&quot;[27] Unless, of course, one assumes
that welfare recipients are less likely to be rational judges
of their own self-interest.

<p>

Fealty to the premise that all individuals are morally autonomous
creatures argues against such a premise.  And the migration of
welfare recipients to states with higher welfare benefits provides
empirical corroboration that welfare mothers are indeed capable
of making rational decisions to govern their own lives.  Welfare
mothers are dependent, we believe, not because they are incompetent
or morally lacking but because they have made rational decisions
in an irrational system.

<p>

Moral concern, informed by empirical evidence, demands admission
that the service approach to both family breakdown and welfare
dependency has failed.  Welfare reform that fails to curb the
cash that subsidizes illegitimacy is not a vision of reducing
dependency, but a vision of administering &quot;benefits&quot;
to an ever-expanding population that will always be mired in dependency.
It is an abandonment of the conviction that people on welfare
are fully human and fully capable of achieving self-sufficiency.
And it is an insidious guarantee that welfare spending will continue
to crawl steadily upward while illegitimacy continues to increase
as well.

<p>

If the amount of money we are spending on welfare were buying
healthy families and stable communities, we would raise no objection.
Our concern is not that we are spending too much, but that we
are killing off marriage and all the blessings and safeguards
marriage buys for women and children.

<p>

Admitting the failure of the service approach will require tough
political choices.  Those choices will undoubtedly offend both
the welfare industry and feminist ideology.  But politicians should
take heart from polling data that demonstrates broad-based public
support for modest but real steps to reduce illegitimacy.

<p>

According to a poll conducted by Voter/Consumer Research for Family
Research Council in mid-October 1995, three out of four Americans
believe welfare encourages illegitimacy.  By a ratio of two to
one, Americans feel that reducing illegitimacy is a more important
-- and more realistic -- goal than &quot;getting single mothers
with few job skills into jobs that will pay them enough to support
themselves and their children.&quot;  Voters favor a preventative,
anti-illegitimacy strategy, in other words, rather than a remedial
workfare strategy.  And by an overwhelming margin of 84 percent
to 13 percent, they favor the family cap provision as a modest
first step toward reversing the trend in illegitimacy.

<p>

Only by historical accident were unwed mothers -- of any age --
ever included in the AFDC program.  Frances Perkins, President
Roosevelt's Secretary of Labor and chief architect of welfare
policy, opposed extending federal entitlements to unmarried mothers
because she foresaw that subsidizing illegitimacy would escalate
family breakdown.  And, tragically, she was right.  While less
than 3 percent of the young beneficiaries of the program in the
late 1930s were the children of unwed mothers, today the tables
have completely turned.  In the year between October 1991 and
September 1992, only 1.6 percent of the children on AFDC qualified
because a parent was deceased.

<p>

It would be ironic at best if the current majority in Congress
were to find themselves to the left of the most liberal member
of the Roosevelt Administration because they rejected her intuition,
now confirmed by years of sad experience.  It is the potential
to reverse that sad experience that must define &quot;compassion&quot;
in the present debate.  As the one policy option that promises
to effect change in the current system, restrictions on benefits
by definition constitute the compassionate alternative.

<p>

Gertrude Himmelfarb notes that the word &quot;compassion&quot;
once described &quot;a moral sentiment, not a political principle,
a sentiment evoked by misery or sorrow, not by poverty as such.&quot;[28]
As political salvationism sought to preempt traditional morals
in the last 30 years, it was only natural that moral sentiments
should be confused with political principles.  Likewise, that
misery and sorrow should be equated with material poverty; for
the redefinition of compassion required a highly artificial view
of man as no more than a material being.

<p>

If compassion is once again properly understood, perhaps then
it will become more obvious that the object of our concern must
be &quot;misery&quot; and &quot;sorrow,&quot; not economic poverty,
and that the &quot;misery&quot; most evident today is the spiritual 
and moral deprivation visited upon dependents of the welfare system. 
It is time that we stop suppressing the moral responsibilities that 
make life precious for a resident of the inner city just the same as 
for a middle-class suburbanite.  It is time, in short, to secure equal
access to the central satisfactions of family, virtue, and freedom.

<p>

In the end, we will adopt answers by default only because there
is no alternative strategy.  There are two competing alternatives
currently at play to define the future of the welfare state. 
Either we will treat welfare dependents as wards of a custodial
state, and we will spend lavishly to keep them comfortable while
we ask them simply to leave us alone.  Or we can begin relimiting
government and restoring social functions to neighborhoods, communities,
and churches.

<p>

The family cap is a symbolic first attempt to begin reversing
the big-government policies that have proven so obviously destructive
to children and families -- and an important opportunity to begin
dissolving the wall that separates welfare families from middle-class
society.

<p>

We can't afford to wait any longer to act.  Senator Moynihan,
who led the charge against illegitimacy thirty years ago, has
already fallen victim to despair.  While candid about the human
cost of the current system, he argues for the status quo simply
because he believes there is no longer any alternative.  Young
males in the inner city &quot;can be horrid to themselves, horrid
to one another, horrid to the rest of us,&quot; he says.  Dismantle
the current system, and they will be unleashed on the rest of us.

<p>

It seems appropriate to us to subject Moynihan's &quot;containment
policy&quot; to the test President Clinton formulated in the early
days of the welfare debate -- &quot;Is this morally correct?&quot;
We would have to answer &quot;no.&quot;  Surely the underclass
is no less human and no further beyond reclamation than the rest
of us flawed individuals.

<p>

Moynihan also bases his opposition to reform on projections about
the number of children who will be thrown into the streets.  Social
scientist Charles Murray responds that, &quot;like all policy
projections, this analysis reflects a set of assumptions&quot;[29]
-- namely, that limiting welfare will do nothing to change behavior.

<p>

But Father Robert Sirico has noted an interesting demographic
trend that suggests otherwise.  Food stamp rolls have fallen dramatically
-- without any change in underlying economic data.  And the bulk
of the drop occurred since January 1995, when Congress convened
to announce new limits on entitlements.  During the previous four
years, the rolls had steadily swelled, sometimes expanding by
40,000 recipients per week.  Sirico concludes that food stamp
recipients factored in expectations of what the new Congress would
do and acted accordingly.  &quot;Poor people are a lot smarter
than social scientists give them credit for being.  Like everyone
else, they plan ahead, with a view toward a certain amount of
future financial stability, which sometimes leads them to the
want ads and to churches and community organizations,&quot;[30]
he says.

<p>

Political opponents cannot merely claim that Republican reforms
will cause suffering and expect to maintain their credibility.
In addition to thinking creatively about the ways policy affects
human behavior, we also have to come to terms with the degree
of suffering that is occurring now.  Proponents of the status
quo say that only the federal government has the resources to
maintain existing welfare programs.  But perhaps existing welfare
programs should <I>not</I> be maintained precisely because they
have caused so much duress for the children and adults mired in
dependency.  The degree of Senator Moynihan's despair is an argument
that we can do no less than search for a radically different approach
to welfare.  The time to begin is now.

<h2>STATEMENT ON HOMOSEXUALITY</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by<br>
Jeffrey B. Satinover, M.D.</center>

<p>

This speech was presented at a July 2, 1996 Capitol Hill briefing
regarding the Defense of Marriage Act. The briefing was sponsored
by the Family Research Council.</i>

<br><br><br><p><center>

<i>In this age, in this country, public sentiment is everything. With it,<br>
nothing can fail; against it, nothing can succeed. Whoever molds<br>
public sentiment goes deeper than he who enacts statutes, or<br>
pronounces judicial decisions.</i>

<p>

-- Abraham Lincoln

</center><p>

On July 15, 1993, National Public Radio made a dramatic announcement
on stations across the country -- a team of scientists at the
National Institutes of Health had perhaps found the gene that
causes homosexuality. Their report would be published the next
day in <I>Science,</I> the most prestigious scientific research
journal in the world.[1]

<p>

The discussion that followed explained for the listening public
the implications of these findings for social attitudes toward
homosexuality and for public policy concerning it. Science had
proven what many had long argued -- that homosexuality is innate,
genetic and therefore unchangeable; a normal and commonplace variant
of human nature. In the light of these findings, only the bigoted
or ignorant could condemn it in any way.

<p>

Shortly after the announcement, amidst a blizzard of press discussions,
the study was highlighted in the watershed legal battle over &quot;Amendment
2.&quot; This popularly-enacted legislation precluded making sexual
orientation the basis of &quot;privileged class&quot; minority
status. Recently, Amendment 2 was overturned by the U. S. Supreme
largely because opposition to homosexuality was argued by the
court to have no substantive basis -- it was but an &quot;irrational
animus.&quot; The Court's argument was quite consistent with the
way that studies such as this were now being understood.

<p>

Among the many crucial issues raised by the legislation was the
question of whether homosexuality was indeed normal, innate and
unchangeable. Certainly, the message promulgated by NPR's report
on this research, and by all the discussions that followed, was
that it was indeed innate and unchangeable. In a few weeks, 
<I>Newsweek</I> would emblazon across its cover the
phrase that would stick in the public mind as the final truth
about homosexuality: &quot;Gay Gene?&quot;

<p>

Of course, just near the end of the NPR discussion, certain necessary
caveats were fleetingly added. But only an expert knew what they
meant -- that the research actually showed nothing whatever in
the way of what was being discussed. The vast majority of listeners
would think that homosexuality had been proven nearly conclusively
to be &quot;genetic.&quot; But is there such a &quot;gay gene&quot;?
In fact, the researchers responsible for this and other studies
being put forth as supporting such a claim, clearly acknowledge
that it does not -- but you need to be a scientist to understand
why and what <I>is</I> meant by the studies. Here is the nub of
the matter: <I>Almost every human behavioral trait -- homosexuality
included -- is &quot;heritable.&quot; Almost none are &quot;genetic&quot;
or are &quot;inherited.&quot;</I> Is this a contradiction?

<p>

In fact, it isn't, but most people will assume that the two statements
mean the same thing when they actually mean very different things.
All the touted studies to date confirm that, like everything else
in human personality, homosexuality is &quot;at least somewhat
heritable.&quot; None come even close to suggesting that it is
genetic (or inherited).

<p>

When it comes to questions of the genetics of any behavior, homosexuality
included, all of the following statements are likely to be at
least roughly true:

<p><ol>

<li>&quot;Such-and-such&quot; a behavior is &quot;genetic&quot;
<li>There are no genes that produce the behavior
<li>The genes associated with the behavior are found on such and
such a chromosome
<li>The behavior is significantly heritable
<li>The behavior is not inherited

</ol><p>

The scientific distinctions that make these seeming-contradictions
perfectly reasonable and consistent are at best completely misunderstood
by the media who reports on them.

<p>

In response to the &quot;gay gene&quot; research, <I>The Wall
Street Journal</I> headlined their report (which appeared the
next day), &quot;Research Points Toward a Gay Gene.&quot;[2] A subheading
of the <I>Journal</I> article stated, &quot;Normal Variation,&quot;
leaving the casual reader with the impression that the research
led to this conclusion. It did not, nor could it have. The subhead
alluded to nothing more than one researcher's personal, unsubstantiated
<I>opinion</I> that homosexuality, as he put it, &quot;is a normal
variant of human behavior.&quot; Even <I>The New York Times</I>,
in its more moderate front-page article, &quot;Report Suggests
Homosexuality is Linked to Genes&quot; noted that researchers
warned against overinterpreting the work, &quot;or in taking it
to mean anything as simplistic as that the 'gay gene' had been
found.&quot; (In October of 1995, the whole process repeated itself
when the same author published a follow-up study.)

<p>

At end of the <I>Journal</I> article, at the bottom of the last
paragraph on the last page deep within the paper, a prominent
geneticist was quoted for his reactions to the research. He observed
that &quot;the gene . . . may be involved in something other than
sexual behavior. <I>For example, it may be that the supposed gene
is only 'associated' with homosexuality, rather than a 'cause'
of it</I>.&quot;

<p>

This rather cryptic comment would be most difficult to understand
without the needed background. Yet it is the most critical distinction
in the entire article <I>and is the central issue in the entire
question</I>. Why bury and fail to explain what it means? Perhaps
the motives were innocent, but in fact, the belief that homosexuality
is &quot;biological&quot; or &quot;genetic&quot; causes people
to develop more positive attitudes toward it. They need not have
the foggiest understanding of what &quot;biological&quot; or 
&quot;genetic&quot; really mean:

<p><blockquote>

<i>105 volunteer[s]... were exposed to one of three... conditions....
[T]he experimental group read a summary... emphasizing a biological
component of homosexual orientation.... [O]ne control group
read a summary... focusing on the absence of hormonal differences
between homosexual and heterosexual men. [A]nother control group
w[as] not exposed to either article.... As predicted, subjects
in the experimental group had significantly lower[3] scores [more
positive attitudes toward homosexuals] than subjects in the control
groups.</i>[4]

</blockquote><p>

And:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Analysis indicated that subjects who believed that homosexuals
are &quot;born that way&quot; held significantly more positive
attitudes toward homosexuals than subjects who believed that homosexuals
&quot;choose to be that way&quot; and/or &quot;learn to be that
way.&quot;</i>[5]

</blockquote><p>

What was actually going in the study the media was trumpeting?
The research in question was a variety of behavioral genetics
study now becoming widespread -- the so-called &quot;linkage study.&quot;
Researchers identify a behavioral trait that runs in a family
and then look to see whether there is a chromosomal variant in
the genetic material of that family, and if that variant is more
frequent in the family members who have the trait.

<p>

To the uninitiated, a positive finding (&quot;correlation&quot;
or &quot;association&quot; of a genetic structure with a behavioral
trait) is taken to mean that the trait &quot;is genetic.&quot;
<I>In fact, it means absolutely nothing of the sort, and there
is virtually no human trait without innumerable such correlations.</I>
We will see shortly just how this is can be so. The most important
take-home messages will be these:

<p>

(1) All the research that has been done on homosexuality seems
as though selectively trumpeted through the press in order to
shape public opinion -- hence public policy -- in predictable
ways. The research itself means almost nothing.

<p>

(2) The research projects that would <I>truly</I> mean something
are scarcely being done because they would all explicitly or tacitly
lead to two currently unpopular ends: a) the uncovering of factors
<I>having nothing to do with homosexuality per se</I> (whether
environmental or temperamental) that place an individual at greater
risk for homosexuality; and b) once these factors are known, are
even suspected, the development of better methods than already
exist to reverse and prevent homosexuality.

<p>

(3) The quality of some of the research has been severely criticized
-- but this point is a distraction. Even were it superb, the findings
would still mean almost nothing. Higher-quality studies will without
question produce comparable results that mean equally little.

<p>

(4) To whatever extent this research has been good enough to generate
valid conclusions at all, these conclusions are precisely the
opposite of what is claimed in the press.

<p>

Before we talk about specifics, here is what serious scientists
think about the recent behavior-caused-by-genes research.

<p>

From <I>Science,</I> 1994:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Time and time again, scientists have claimed that particular genes
or chromosomal regions are associated with behavioral traits,
only to withdraw their findings when they were not replicated.
&quot;Unfortunately,&quot; says Yale's [Dr. Joel] Gelernter, &quot;it's
hard to come up with many findings linking specific genes
to complex human behaviors that have been replicated.&quot;...
All were announced with great fanfare; all were greeted unskeptically
in the popular press; all are now in disrepute.</i>[6]

</blockquote><p>

A scientist at Washington University School of Medicine calculated
what would be required for a confirmatory replication. He:

<p><blockquote>

<i>...projected that if the trait [in question] was 50 percent heritable...
detecting [just] one of [its] genes would require studying 175
families -- that is, almost 2000 people.[7] Replicati[on] would require
studying 781 families -- another 8000 people.... [E]ach additional
gene (for a polygenic trait), researchers would need... the
whole business again. &quot;Suddenly you're talking about tens
of thousands of people and years of work and millions of 
dollars.&quot;</i>[8]

</blockquote><p>

Using arguable-at-best methods, two American activists recently
published studies showing that if one of a pair of identical twins
is homosexual, the odds that the other one is, too, are more than
50 percent. On this basis, they argue that &quot;homosexuality
is genetic.&quot; British researchers generated comparable results
in a similar study. Their conclusion? The surprisingly low odds
that both twins were homosexual:

<p><blockquote>

<i>confirmed that genetic factors are insufficient explanation for
the development of sexual orientation.</i>[9]

</blockquote><p>

Two Columbia University researchers (who have published the most
comprehensive research summary on the subject to date) note the
unexpectedly:

<p><blockquote>

<i>... large proportion of monozygotic twins who [did not share]
homosexuality despite sharing not only their genes but also their
prenatal and familial environments.[10] The... [50 percent odds]...
for homosexuality among the identical twins could be entirely
accounted for by the increased similarity of their developmental
experiences. In my opinion, the major finding of that study is
that 48 percent of identical twins who were reared together [and
where at least one was homosexual] were discordant for sexual
orientation.</i>[11]

</blockquote><p>

Two other genetics researchers (one heads one of the largest genetics
departments in the country, the other is at Harvard) comment:

<p><blockquote>

<i>... recent studies seeking a genetic basis for homosexuality
suggests that... we may be in for a new molecular phrenology,
rather than true scientific progress and insight into behavior.

<p>

While the authors interpreted their findings as evidence for a
genetic basis for homosexuality, we think that the data in fact
provide strong evidence for the influence of the environment.</i>[12]

</blockquote><p>

The author of the lead article on genes and behavior in a special
issue of <I>Science</I> notes:

<p><blockquote>

<i>... the growing understanding that the interaction of genes and
environment is much more complicated than the simple &quot;violence
genes&quot; and &quot;intelligence genes&quot; touted in the popular
press. Indeed, <I>renewed appreciation of environmental factors
is one of the chief effects of the increased belief in genetics'
effects on behavior</I> [My emphasis]. The same data that show
the effects of genes also point to the enormous influence of non-genetic
factors.</i>[13]

</blockquote><p>

The director of the Center for Developmental and Health Genetics
at Pennsylvania State University comments:

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;Research into heritability is the best demonstration I know
of the importance of the environment.&quot;</i>

</blockquote><p>

(Note the term &quot;heritability.&quot; We will be returning
to it in detail as it lies at the heart of much confusion).

<p>

With regard to Hamer's work on what the press calls &quot;the
gay gene,&quot; genetics researchers from Yale, Columbia and Louisiana
State Universities noted that:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Much of the discussion of [Hamer's et al.] finding [of a purported
gene locus for homosexuality] has focused on its social and political
ramifications. [But] inconsistencies... suggest that this finding
should be interpreted cautiously....

<p>

[Hamer's et al.] results are not consistent with any genetic model....neither
of these differences [between homosexuality in maternal versus
paternal uncles or cousins] is statistically significant....small
sample sizes make these data compatible with a range of hypotheses.

<p>

[T]he... data... present no consistent support for the results.</i>[14]

</blockquote><p>

It does not seem to have been widely reported that Hamer responded
carefully, and accurately, to his fellow scientists, as follows:

<p><blockquote>

<i>We did not say that [the chromosome segment under study] 
&quot;underlies&quot; sexuality, only that it contributes to it in 
some families. Nor have we said that [it] represents a &quot;major&quot; 
gene, only that its influence is statistically detectable in the 
population that we studied.</i>[15]

</blockquote><p>

Setting aside possible flaws in the research, would the findings
actually point to this more modest claim with any degree of certainty?
In fact, they don't -- as Hamer himself acknowledges, but in language
that will surely evade general understanding -- and that is likely
(because of its complexity) to be avoided by the press:

<p><blockquote>

<i>the question of the appropriate significance level to apply to
a non-Mendelian trait such as sexual orientation is problematic.</i>[16]

</blockquote><p>

English translation: &quot;It is not possible to know what the
findings mean, if anything, since sexual orientation can't be
inherited the way eye-color is.&quot; The bottom line, in his
words, is what serious researchers know, but the public doesn't:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Complex behavioral traits are the product of multiple genetic
and environmental antecedents, with 'environment' meaning not
only the social environment but also such factors as the 'flux
of hormones during development, whether you were lying on your
right or left side in the womb and a whole parade of other things'...the
relationships among genes and environment probably have a somewhat
different effect on someone in Salt Lake City than if that person
were growing up in New York City.</i>[17]

</blockquote><p>

English translation: You're more likely to become gay growing
up in Manhattan than in Utah among Mormons and Christian fundamentalists,
even if everything else is the same, including genes.

<p>

Activists are readily able to feed the public what they wish only
in part because of an easily-led or poorly-educated press. The
major reason is really that the ideas being distorted beyond recognition
once they leave the labs are inherently complex, even when presented
properly. There are no &quot;lite,&quot; sound-bite versions that
aren't fundamentally in error in one way or another.

<p>

Nonetheless, if one grasps at least some of the basics, in simple
form, it will be possible to see exactly why the current research
into homosexuality means so little -- and will continue to mean
little even should the quality of the research methods improve
-- so long as it remains driven by politics.

<p>

<center><h3>TWO BASIC PRINCIPLES</h3></center>

<p>

There are really only two major principles that need to be carefully
assimilated in order to see through public relations distortions
to the actual meaning of recent research. They are as follows:

<p><ol>

<li><I>Heritable</I> does not mean <I>inherited</I>.

<p>

<li>Meaningful genetics research identifies and then focuses on
traits that <I>are</I> directly inherited.

</ol><p>

Let's begin with the first point -- that <I>heritable</I> does
not mean <I>inherited</I>.

<p>

<I>Heritability</I> studies can be done on almost any human trait
-- physical, behavioral, emotional, etc. -- and will show positive
results. That is, almost every human characteristic you can think
of is in some measure <I>heritable</I>. But few human behavioral
traits are directly <I>inherited</I> the way simple physiological
traits are (e.g., eye color).

<p>

&quot;Inherited&quot; means &quot;determined directly by genes,&quot;
with little or no way of changing the trait by choice, or by preventing
it, or by modifying the environment in which the trait has emerged
(or is more likely to emerge).

<p>

Here is a hypothetical example, but it is 100 percent plausible.
It tracks the kinds of studies that have been done with innumerable
other traits, including homosexuality. (But only in the area of
homosexuality has the meaning of such studies been so badly distorted.)

<p>

Suppose that for political reasons you want to demonstrate that
there is a &quot;basketball gene&quot; that &quot;makes&quot;
people become basketball players -- BBPs. (Suspend your intuitive
sense that the idea is absurd.) To make your case, you would use
the same research methods as with homosexuality. These methods
fall into three categories, and represent important preliminary
research when investigating any trait:

<p><ul>

(a) twin studies

<p>

(b) brain dissections

<p>

(c) gene &quot;linkage&quot; studies

</ul><p>

<b>(a) Twin Studies</b>

<p>

The basic idea in twin studies is to show that the more genetically
similar are two people, the more likely it is that they will share
the trait you're studying. So, you create a study set of pairs
of people, divided into categories according to how genetically
similar they are, as follows.

<p><hr><p>

<center><pre>
<b>Pair Type                   Degree of Genetic Similarity</b>
<b>                            (% same genes)              </b>

<i><b>Identical Twins</b></i>                    100%                 
<i><b>Fraternal (Non-identical) Twins</b></i>     50%                 
<i><b>Non-Twin Brothers or Sisters</b></i>        50%                 
<i><b>Unrelated People</b></i>                    &lt;5%                 

</pre></center>

<p><hr><p>

The most similar are identical twins, the next most similar are
fraternal twins (who are on average as different as non-twin brothers
or sisters, but no more so), the least similar are unrelated people.

<p>

Then you identify those pairs of twins in which at least one is
a BBP. It will not be difficult to show that if one such identical
twin is a BBP, his brother (or her sister) more frequently will
be, too, than would a non-identical twin or a non-twin sibling
or a non-sibling. You would create groups of such different kinds
of pairs to make the comparison in a large number of cases. (One
set of identical twin pairs, one set of non-identical twin pairs,
one set of non-twin siblings, and so on.) From the &quot;concordance
rate&quot; in each set (the percentage of pairs in each set in
which either both are BBPs or both aren't. Pairs in which one
was and the other wasn't would be called &quot;discordant for
BBP&quot;) you would calculate a &quot;heritability&quot; rate.
(Perhaps you have an armchair guess as to how many identical twin-pairs
either <I>both</I> play or <I>both</I> don't play basketball.
Probably a good deal more than half, the concordance rate for
homosexuality in such twin-pairs.)

<p>

You respond to the reporter from <I>Sports Illustrator</I> that
&quot;our research demonstrates that BBP is very strongly heritable,&quot;
and you'd be right. But the article that comes out that month
reads something slightly different, but completely wrong. &quot;&#133;
recent research shows that basketball playing is probably inherited.
A number of outside researchers examined the work and found it
substantially accurate and well-performed. They cautioned against
arriving at hasty conclusions, however.&quot; No one notices the
difference.

<p>

Thus, the authors of a widely-reported set of twin studies describe
their intent to alter &quot;public sentiment&quot; as follows:

<p><blockquote>

<i>These studies were designed to detect heritable variation, and
if it was present, to counter the prevalent belief that sexual
orientation is largely the product of family interactions and
the social environment.</i>[18]

</blockquote><p>

But they themselves acknowledge in their own paper that:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Although male and female homosexuality appear to be at least somewhat
heritable, environment must also be of considerable importance
in their origins.</i>[19]

</blockquote><p>

<b>(b) Brain Dissections</b>

<p>

Second, your colleagues perform a series of autopsies on the brains
of some dead people who appear to have been BBPs. (Old jerseys,
high-top sneakers and Knick's ticket-stubs were found among their
possessions, for example.) They do the same with a group of dead
non-players (no sneakers, jerseys or tickets.) They report that,
on average, &quot;certain parts of the brain long thought to be
involved with BBP are much larger in the group of BBPs than in
the controls.&quot; Certain nationally-renowned newspapers in
the Northeast pick up on the story and editorialize, &quot;It
will be very difficult for anyone except poorly-educated yokels
who believe in Santa Claus, the Tooth-Fairy and God to argue that
basketball playing isn't inborn. For not only has it been proven
to run in families, even the <I>brains</I> of basketball players
are different.&quot;

<p>

In a pretense of balance, some of these papers interview die-hard
believers in the old view -- yokels who still think that one must
decide to play basketball, and play it for a long time, before
you really can be considered &quot;a BBP.&quot; One of them is
quoted as claiming that &quot;maybe if you do something long enough
your brain changes as you get better at it, and that part of the
brain gets bigger.&quot; (Remarkably enough, this surmise seems
obvious to the old-time believer.) The reporter doesn't merely
report the comment, however, he also hints that it's especially
idiotic -- typical of die-hards and yokels -- since everyone knows
the brain doesn't change. For example, with regard to homosexuality,
<I>The Wall Street Journal</I> chided:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Some religious fundamentalists even suggested that homosexual
activity somehow could have caused the structural differences
[in the brain].</i>[20]

</blockquote><p>

Of course, you yourself are well-aware that among neuroscientists
it is extremely old news that the brain indeed changes, quite
dramatically, in just the way the old die-hard guessed: those
parts responsible for an activity get much, much bigger over time
(and there are definitely parts that are more utilized in BBP.
Similarly:

<p><blockquote>

<i>... in individuals who became blind as adults and then learned
Braille, the part of the brain governing the right index finger
became progressively enlarged.)</i>[21]

</blockquote><p>

Thus, the editor of <I>Nature,</I> the world's most eminent scientific
journal (the British counterpart to <I>Science</I>) remarked on
this research that:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Plainly, the neural correlates of genetically determined gender
are plastic at a sufficiently early stage. . . . Plastic structures
in the hypothalamus allowing the consequences of early sexual
arousal to be made permanent might suit [those who claim an environmental
origin to homosexuality] well.</i>[22]

</blockquote><p>

<b>(c) Gene &quot;Linkage&quot; Studies</b>

<p>

Now for the <I>coup de grace</I>. You find a couple of families
of BBPs and compare them to some families of non-BBPs. You have
a hunch that of innumerable genes of every imaginable sort likely
to be &quot;associated&quot; or &quot;linked&quot; to BBP (you
never use the word &quot;causing&quot; because you don't need
to -- no one knows the difference), there are some genes on, say,
the X-Chromosome. After a few false starts, sure enough, you find
what you're looking for: among the BBP families is more commonly
found (though not always) one particular chromosomal variant (cluster
of genes) than among the non-players.

<p>

Now, sympathizers in the press were long-ago quietly informed
of your research, since they want people to come around to certain
beliefs, too. So, as soon as your work hits the press, they're
on the air: &quot;Researchers are hot on the trail of the 'Basketball
Gene!' In an article to be published tomorrow in <I>Sports Science</I>....
&quot; Learned-sounding commentators muse about the enormous public
policy implications of this superb piece of 
science-in-the-service-of-humankind. Two weeks later, there it is 
again, at a jaunty angle across the cover of the major national 
newsweekly: &quot;Basketball Gene.&quot;

<p>

Now what's wrong with this scenario? It's simple: of course BBP
is <I>heritable</I> (&quot;has a non-zero <I>heritability</I>&quot;
to use the words of genetics researchers). That's because many
physiological traits, such as muscle strength, speed, agility,
reflex speed, height, etc., are themselves directly <I>inherited</I>,
and they make it more or less likely that one can, and will want
to, and will successfully, and will therefore continue to want
to, and will, in fact, continue to, play basketball. In short,
because of intermediate <I>inherited</I> traits <I>associated</I>
with BBP (none of which <I>are</I> BBP), it shows significant
<I>heritability</I>. (The genetic <I>association</I>, of course,
is in no way necessary or predetermined, and is highly 
culturally-conditioned: there were no BBPs at all in, say, ancient 
Greece, yet the same genes were there.)

<p>

BBP also shows a strong <I>biological representation in
the brain,</I> both at birth (e.g., nervous system factors contributing
to reflex speed) and especially later (e.g., the parts of the
cortex that are cultivated and become responsible for the movements
of basketball).

<p>

And the specific genes that run in families that are responsible
for height, athleticism, etc. can surely be found and they will
be statistically <I>linked</I> to BBP. If one identical twin decides
to play basketball, the unusually strong emotional bond between
such siblings will make it even more likely that his twin will,
too. (The fact of their genetic <I>identity</I>, not their specific
genes, is here influencing an outcome above and beyond the indirect
contributions from any specific genes.)

<p>

The basic problem is this: BBP is &quot;influenced&quot; (made
more or less an easy and enjoyable thing to do) by the presence
or absence of other associated traits. For BBP we can readily
guess what they are and so immediately see that the &quot;genetic&quot;
component of BBP has nothing to do with the game itself but with
these associated (facilitating) traits. What are these traits?
Height, athleticism, bone structure, reflexes, muscle refresh
rate, and so on. So obvious are the specifics of this association
that no one will waste his time looking into the genetics of BBP
proper. They willconcentrate on the obvious intermediate traits
-- height, athleticism, and so on.

<p>

The same is true for homosexuality, except (a) the more important,
intermediate traits with which it is associated are mostly unknown
and suspected ones are harder to confirm and (b) the research
agenda seems diverted by the political requirement that no such
associated traits be discovered and that homosexuality be presented
as directly inherited.

<p>

Good genetics research must identify and then focus on traits
that are directly inherited. Research into merely <I>heritable</I>
traits is useful only in generating hypotheses about what the
directly inherited traits might be. Here's what this means:

<p>

Let's imagine that it wasn't immediately evident to us that the
heritable aspects of BBP were intermediate traits such as height.
A good researcher would not be at all tempted to conclude from
the studies we described that BBP itself was inherited. He would
conclude however that, indeed, there must be some inherited traits
that facilitate BBP, and it would be these as-yet-unknown traits
that were producing the &quot;non-zero heritability&quot; results.
If he could identify the traits correctly, <I>he would find that
the heritability results, when he redirected his genetics research,
would increase dramatically.</I> 

<p>

In other words, studying the genetics of BBP is really a crude
way of unwittingly studying the genetics of height and athleticism.
If he selects his population on the basis of the indirect trait
(BBP), when it is other traits that are really inherited, his
results will be &quot;fuzzed up&quot; by the inevitable proportion
of BBP's who lack these traits, or have them in lesser degree.
But if he correctly identifies the traits in question, his next
round of studies will &quot;divide the herd&quot; more efficiently,
corralling his subjects not by BBP (or &quot;sexual orientation&quot;),
but by height. Of course, there will be more BBPs among the tall
subjects than among the short, but that's incidental. He will
seek out other tall people who aren't BBPs, and in his new study,
the heritability factor (height) will be even more concentrated.

<p>

How might he guess at what the most important traits are, and
then try to confirm his guess, so he could investigate the genetics
of these traits? Very simply. He looks, does the best he can to
name what he sees, and tries not to run afoul of any currently-fashionable
taboos. He'll probably have no trouble studying height, but he
might run into difficulties if he thinks that athleticism (or
even height) has a racial association. (More people of Nordic
stock, being taller, are likely to become basketball players than
do people of Appenzeller Swiss stock, being short. Perhaps other
such groupings might occur to a researcher.)

<p>

In the case of homosexuality, the <I>inherited</I> traits that
are more common among homosexuals (and that produce &quot;non-zero
<I>heritability</I>&quot; in studies) might include such qualities
as greater than average tendency to anxiety, shyness, sensitivity,
intelligence, aesthetic abilities and so on. (Of course, these
traits may themselves be further reducible to a variety of 
mutually-influencing, associated genetic and non-genetic factors.) 
The brain changes that are more prevalent among homosexuals, the 
increased tendency of homosexuality to run in families (and to vary 
with degree of genetic similarity within families) and the presence 
of associated chromosomal markings are all certainly due to as yet 
unresearched and therefore not-yet-identified intermediate traits. 
There is <I>no</I> evidence that homosexuality itself is inherited.

<p>

Like height and BBP, these traits -- intelligence, say, or anxiety
-- are surely widely distributed in the population at large and
densely present therefore in groups that are properly selected
to have them. If researchers had divided their population by shyness
or aesthetic sensibility, and ignored the homosexual-non-homosexual
division they might well have found even stronger chromosomal
linkages and heritability.

<p>

<center><h3>CHANGE</h3></center>

<p>

The effect on &quot;public sentiment&quot; of the widely-believed
but unsubstantiated claim that &quot;homosexuality is inherited&quot;
is to convince people that it is unchangeable. That people wrestling
with homosexuality sincerely and accurately have detected homosexual
impulses in themselves since childhood lends credence to the 
&quot;innate&quot; argument. But if, as the evidence strongly 
suggests, homosexuality is not inherited (even if deeply embedded, and 
far from a simple choice), the converse should be true -- it should be 
changeable.

<p>

Indeed, a dispassionate examination of more than 50 years of research
in homosexual change confirms that it is changeable in just the
way that deeply embedded impulses are: with difficulty, and in
the absence of a consistent long-term program of unbiased research,
with less than 100 percent but very significant success. As the
following studies suggest, many including long-term follow-up,
success rates above 50 percent are already achievable. There is
every reason to expect that a purposeful, well-supported program
of research could achieve considerably more.

<center><h3>Conclusions</h3></center>

<p>

Two profoundly mistaken ideas have sunk deeply into public sentiment
where they exert a powerful influence in the shaping of public
policy as it relates to family, sexuality and marriage. These
are:

<p><ol>

<li>That homosexuality &quot;is genetic,&quot; and that, consequently;
<li>Homosexuality is unchangeable.

</ol><p>

Neither idea is true, and in fact there is substantial scientific
evidence to the contrary. There are two groups of Americans being
severely harmed by the propagation of these untruths:

<ol><p>

<li>The very large number of homosexuals who wish nothing more
than to rid themselves of these unwanted impulses and establish
quiet marriages and families. The gay and lesbian activism that
claims to speak for all homosexuals speaks for these many struggling
fellow citizens in no way whatsoever. Even more completely ignored
are the very large number of people who have already successfully
negotiated this difficult, but extraordinarily rewarding, passage.

<p>

<li>The rising generation of youngsters, an ever-growing proportion
of whom -- because of the rapidly deteriorating family -- are
at risk for profound identity confusion of every sort, sexual
as well. If our children are not correctly instructed as to the
true possibilities for homosexual change, as well as of its nature,
many will be misguided into accepting a way of life which, in
they end, they do no want, and which is in conflict with their
most cherished private beliefs.

</ol><p>

Perhaps even more troubling is this: Epidemiologists around the
country have confirmed that among young gay men there is a significant
return to the unsafest of sexual practices in spite of more than
15 years of massively-funded education programs. Multiple studies
at centers around the country suggest that a shocking 30 percent
of all currently 20-year-old young men who identify themselves
as &quot;gay&quot; will be either HIV-positive or dead of AIDS
by the time they are 30 years of age.[32]

<p>

Yet, as is indicated by recent research, many of these young men
will spontaneously leave homosexuality behind, and formal outcome
studies in homosexual change from before the political chill show
average success rates from a variety of psychotherapeutic (talk
only) treatment modalities (including long term follow-up) of
more than 50 percent. Even were the change rate but 10 percent,
that alone would save the lives of 30 out of every 1000 such young
men.

<title>Hearing on the Administration's Aids Training Program</title>
<body>

<h2>HEARING ON THE<br>
ADMINISTRATION'S AIDS<br>
TRAINING PROGRAM</h2>
<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<h4>Testimony of Robert L. Maginnis, Policy Analyst<br>
Family Research Council<br>
for House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight<br>
Subcommittee on Civil Service<br>
Representative John L. Mica, Chairman<br>
June 22, 1995</h4></center>
<p>
Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, it is a pleasure
to address you today concerning the Administration's AIDS training
program.
<p>
President Clinton announced on September 30, 1993 to all heads
of executive departments his HIV/AIDS policy.  The policy requires
each departmental secretary to designate a senior staff member
to implement HIV/AIDS training programs and to develop workplace
policies for employees with HIV/AIDS.
<p>
The training has received a mixed review.  Some federal employees
have called the Family Research Council to complain that they
found the training offensive.  Others have said it was relatively
benign.
<p>
The Administration's AIDS awareness training has numerous problems.
 It does not reduce the risks of contracting HIV, and it merely
recites the provisions outlined in the Americans with Disabilities
Act.  The training duplicates other federal AIDS education programs,
and it has been used to promote homosexuality.
<p>
You asked me to address four questions.
<p>
<b>First, does the training meet the statutory objective?</b>
<p>
The governing statute defines &quot;training&quot; as &quot;the
process of providing for and making available to an employee ...[information]...which
will improve individual and organizational performance and assist
in achieving the agency's mission and performance goals.&quot;
<p>
It remains a mystery as to how this training meets the objective.
 The government's publications provide little help.  For example,
the Treasury Department's AIDS awareness booklet quotes President Clinton,
&quot;We need to set an example.&quot;  An example of what?
<p>
The Agriculture Department outlined its training goals:  to shatter
the myths about AIDS, explain how to treat people with AIDS, to
encourage employees to keep an open mind to better understand
AIDS, and to emphasize that AIDS is difficult to contract.  There
was no attempt to link the agency's mission and goals with the
training.
<p>
While Agriculture's AIDS goals could also be made for cancer or
heart disease, which kill many more Americans every year, the
federal government doesn't mandate three hours of training to
prevent these diseases.
<p>
In fact, federal government-sponsored AIDS awareness training
may have been a good idea in 1987.  But after spending $500 million
per year on AIDS education for many years, the Clinton Administration's
program appears to be a total waste of taxpayer money.
<p>
Conservative estimates of the costs to the taxpayer of  the Administration's
program are over $80 million in lost productivity, material, and
fees.  Congress should demand a full accounting.   
<p>
The Administration's AIDS program focuses almost exclusively on
awareness and has little impact on behavior change.  Since HIV
is contracted through behavior and not from breathing bad air,
training that ignores diagnosis and fails to contribute to behavior
modification will have minimal impact.
<p>
<b>Second, what have federal civil servants told me about the
training?</b>
<p>
I've heard from civil servants throughout the government.  They
complain that the training was offensive, a big joke, a waste
of time, and that it promoted homosexuality.   Most objected that
the training was mandatory and those who protested were threatened
with adverse personnel actions.
<p>
The training includes a brief history of HIV, symptoms and some
emphasis on prevention and risk reduction.  There is a discussion
of needle sharing and sexual contact.  Federal employees are told
to reduce their HIV contraction risk by practicing &quot;safer
sex&quot; by using barriers like condoms, dental dams, plastic
wrap, and latex gloves.  An employee manual states, &quot;A dental
dam or plastic wrap may be used for any oral-vaginal or oral-anal
contact.  All types of barriers are effective against HIV transmission
only if they are used correctly and consistently from start to
finish.&quot;
<p>
One employee labeled the training as a glorified high school sex
education class with sensitivity training on the side.  Others
objected to the graphic explanations of sexual activities.
<p>
<b>Third, what kind of AIDS training is appropriate for the federal
workplace?</b>
<p>
The federal government spends billions of dollars each year on
AIDS research, education, and treatment.  Much of that money is
wasted because it fails to involve diagnosis.  If the government
wants to impact the epidemic in the workforce, it must link HIV
diagnosis with follow-up counseling and training.
<p>
Such a program would be less expensive than the Administration's
program and far more productive.  For example, an AIDS test now
costs about $2.49.  The federal government could test the &quot;at-risk&quot;
civil servants and then, with the results in hand, provide confidential
follow-up counseling and training.
<p>
Limiting the spread of the virus through behavior reinforcement
or modification should be a top priority.  A test-linked program
is the only meaningful type of training that will help arrest
the epidemic.
<p>
<b>Finally, is legislation needed to better define the kinds of
training in the federal workplace?</b>
<p>
Yes.  Most of the AIDS training is not offensive.  But there are
alarming exceptions.  For example, the Forest Service's Tahoe
Region sponsored AIDS training last year.  It was conducted by
a sexologist, a self-described homosexual phlebotomist, and an
HIV-positive woman from the community.
<p>
The phlebotomist was an ex-convict who tried to debunk &quot;homophobic&quot;
attitudes.  He speculated that many husbands were involved in
homosexual affairs.  He showed a variety of condoms and how to
apply them to a life-size replica of erect male genitalia.  He
even explained a technique for using one's mouth to apply the
condom.  He also explained the proper cleaning techniques when
sharing hypodermic needles.
<p>
In conclusion, the Clinton Administration mandated AIDS awareness
training to appease activists and to provide a platform for the
promotion of homosexuality as the moral equivalent of heterosexuality.
 This training is a subset of the diversity agenda which permeates
the federal bureaucracy today.
<p>
Congress should pass legislation that limits training to the clearly
defined statutory objectives.  Training should not promote a particular
political agenda, redefine the family to include homosexual couples,
or include offensive material.  Training, also should be job related.

<title>HOW SOCIAL SECURITY AFFECTS THE TAX REFORM DEBATE</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">
<h2>HOW SOCIAL SECURITY<br>
AFFECTS THE TAX REFORM<br>
DEBATE</h2>
<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by<br>
William R. Mattox, Jr.</center>
<p>
This speech was given at the Heritage Foundation Resource Bank
Meeting on April 27, 1995 in Philadelphia, Pa.</i>
<p>
This morning's topic is going on the offensive and in thinking
about the range of ideas one could talk about, I was struck by
how many opportunities we now have before us -- and how many of
these ideas would not have even been worthy of discussion just
a short time ago.
<p>
Indeed, today everything is on the table -- except Social Security,
which is why I'd like to devote most of my remarks this morning
to Social Security.  Now, I'm not going to advance any new ideas
about Social Security reform.  I'm not even going to talk about
Social Security directly.
<p>
Instead, I'm going to talk about why anti-family biases inherent
in the Social Security system <b>must</b> be taken into consideration
when we seek to legislate in other areas -- most especially in
pursuing a conservative tax cut agenda.  As you know, the House
recently passed the American Dream Restoration Act -- the crown
jewel of the Contract with America.
<p>
The centerpiece of this measure is a $500 tax credit for children.
Within the conservative movement, there are three views of this
pro-family tax cut:
<p>
1. <b>Social issues conservatives</b> love it and often make
a case for it by citing the extraordinary erosion in per-child
tax benefits since 1950.
<p>
2. <b>Deficit hawks</b> hate it.  They perceive it to be a revenue
drain and claim Americans don't want tax cuts as much as they
want deficit reduction.  This is a questionable proposition, but
even if true, there is nothing that says you can't do both.
<p>
3. <b>Supply-siders</b> are torn about pro-family tax relief.
 On the one hand, most agree with Milton Friedman who says he
has never seen a tax cut he didn't like; and most appreciate the
political argument that pro-family tax relief can enhance the chances 
of passing capital gains cuts and cuts in spending programs.  On the 
other hand, most supply siders see no short-term payoff in terms of 
economic growth -- and for this reason, many want to do the least 
amount necessary to secure pro-family votes.
<p>
Now, I share the supply-siders' interest in growth, but I believe
there is a very compelling economic argument for making pro-family tax relief
our top tax-cut priority.  Allan Carlson of the Rockford Institute
has argued that the Social Security system robs parents of the
social insurance value of their children.  That is, if there were
no old-age social insurance scheme, adults in our society would
have an economic incentive to invest a portion of their time and
money in the rearing of children in order to protect themselves
against the prospect of being destitute in old age.
<p>
Now, Carlson is not suggesting that childrearing is the only means
of protecting oneself against poverty in old age.  Certainly,
one can and should save for such purposes.  Nor is Carlson suggesting
that this economic incentive is, or ever should be, the primary
motivation for raising children.  Certainly, moral imperatives
are, or should be, far more significant factors.  But Carlson
believes moral principles and economic forces should work in harmony.
Yet, in our current system, moral and economic forces are in
conflict.  In our current system, it is economically foolish to
invest in childrearing, for under Social Security productive adults
can live it up today on the resources that might otherwise be
diverted to childrearing and live it up tomorrow on the resources
Social Security takes from other people's adult children and gives
to them.
<p>
This bias calls for fundamental reform of the Social Security
system.  But if such reform cannot even be discussed, then it
is incumbent upon us to offset these anti-family effects through
some other means -- the most logical being per-child tax savings.
 How much in per-child tax savings would be necessary to neutralize
the Social Security system's anti-child bias?  By my calculations,
$2,100 -- and I'll be happy to explain later how I arrived at
that figure if anyone wants to know.
<p>
When one considers that most children offer their parents less
than $400 in tax savings, you can appreciate why some of us pro-family
yahoos hardly regard $500 in addition tax savings as excessive.
Not only does Social Security indirectly discourage people from
having children, but it indirectly discourages them from raising
kids well.  Indeed, under the current system, workaholics who
neglect their childrearing responsibilities do not stand to suffer
economically if their kids grow up to be dolts or sloths (so long
as everybody else's kids can produce enough to keep the
Social Security system afloat).  But in a natural economy free
of old-age entitlements, neglectful parents would stand to lose
much.
<p>
To offset Social Security's bias against investments of parental
time and attention, Carlson argues that we not only need an income
tax -- but a progressive one at that.  A progressive income tax,
he argues, has the effect of causing parents at some point to
shift their attention from paid work to the unpaid work of raising children.
Now, I have little reason to believe that Carlson's enthusiasm
for a progressive income tax is widely shared by many here.
<p>
But lest one think his view represents a threat to the <b>adoption</b>
of a flat tax, it should be noted that, for all practical purposes,
we already have a flat tax.  That's right, when one <b>combines</b>
current income tax rates with current Social Security tax rates,
nearly all taxpayers have a marginal tax rate of roughly 30 percent.
Crudely speaking, for those making below $60,000, this rate is
divided almost equally between a 15 percent income tax rate and
a 15 percent payroll tax.  For most of those making over $60,000,
this 30 percent is derived from a 28 percent income tax rate and
a 2 percent Medicare tax.  While this is a reality that all of
the leading &quot;flat tax&quot; plans currently ignore, it is
a reality that need not threaten many of the appealing features
of such plans -- features like eliminating tax withholding, simplifying
tax forms, and getting rid of many tax write-offs and deductions.
<p>
One tax deduction that ought not to be scrapped, however, is the
charitable deduction.  From the standpoint of economic theory,
I do not know whether there is a compelling reason for preserving
the charitable deduction.  I suspect there is -- but it really
doesn't matter, because the short-run political argument for preserving
the charitable tax deduction is so powerful that no other argument
is perhaps necessary.  If one of our major goals is, as it should
be, dismantling the welfare state, then I think we should recognize
that few Americans are likely to view as credible any agenda which
simultaneously seeks to gut public housing and to eliminate tax
incentives for giving to Habitat for Humanity.  If you think the
public drubbing conservatives took on school lunch was bad, wait
until you see what the Left would do with that.
<p>
Unless we are more troubled by charitable tax deductions than
AFDC and public housing, I think we should steer clear of any
tax simplification plan that eliminates charitable contributions.
Indeed, if we truly want to dismantle the welfare state, I think
we ought to be looking at ways to expand charitable deductions
to non-itemizers as well as ways to permit taxpayers to divert
a portion of their tax liability to a charitable cause of their
choosing.
<p>
Having devoted most of my speech to the indirect effect of Social
Security on various tax issues, I want to close my remarks by
talking about restoring the social institution that provides greater
security -- yes, greater social security -- than any other.  It's
the institution of marriage.  And it is in serious shape.
<p>
My friends, no proactive idea being talked about at this conference
is likely to prevent the eventual collapse of our civilization
unless we see a restoration of lifelong marriage.  While the factors
influencing family breakdown are primarily moral or cultural,
there are at least a few policy ideas worth exploring in these
arenas.
<p>
<i>At the state and local level, we need to be:</i>
<ul><p>
<li>Advancing divorce reform initiatives which require fault to
be established in cases where one spouse wishes to contest the
divorce.  (Current law now favors the spouse wanting to leave
the marriage rather than the one wishing to save the marriage.)
<p>
<li>Advancing tough anti-illegitimacy measures in the context
of welfare reform.
<p>
<li>Promoting abstinence-based programs in schools where sex education
is taught.
<p></ul>
<i>At the federal level we need to:</i>
<ul><p>
<li>Eliminate the Legal Services Corporation, which finances some
300,000 divorces a year.
<p>
<li>Address the perplexing problem of the tax treatment of marriage
in a manner that helps all married couples -- perhaps with a tax
provision tied not just to marital status, but to marital length.
 By extending larger tax benefits with each year a couple stays
together, the tax code could pass along the societal savings of
marital stability to those who have avoided divorce the longest.
</ul><p>
While it is important for us to recognize the virtues of these
pro-family policy reforms, it is also important for us to recognize
the limitations of all policy instruments.  Pro-family tax relief,
for example, will not make husbands love their wives or children
respect their parents.  It will not clean up filthy T.V. or remove
child predators from our streets.  Pro-family tax relief will
not, by itself, magically solve the various social problems facing
America's families, neighborhoods and communities.
<p>
But pro-family tax relief will make it easier for families to
thrive by reducing economic stress.  It will make it easier for
parents to monitor their children's T.V. viewing habits by freeing
them to spend more time with their children.  It will empower
parents to address many family needs that only they can meet.
<p>
This is why pro-family tax relief is so critical -- and why all
parts of the conservative movement ought to embrace it enthusiastically.

<title>HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES HAVE WORSENED</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">

<h2>HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES HAVE<br>
WORSENED SINCE CHINA<br>
RECEIVED MFN STATUS</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<h4>Testimony of Gracie S. Hsu, Policy Analyst<br>
Family Research Council<br>
Submitted to the House Committee on International Relations<br>
Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights<br>
June 18, 1996</h4></center>

<p>

Mr. Chairman, the Family Research Council is pleased that the
Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights has
chosen to address the human rights consequences of extending &quot;most
favored nation&quot; (MFN) trade privileges to China.  This hearing
is especially timely considering the fact that the House of Representatives
is scheduled to vote on legislation regarding China's MFN status
in the coming week.

<p>

Mr. Chairman, for 15 years, the United States has extended &quot;most
favored nation&quot; trade status to China.  Originally, it had
been argued that an economic &quot;open door&quot; might encourage
the Chinese government to shape up their human rights policies,
but in these past 15 years, we have only seen the barbarity and
cruelty of this communist regime increase.

<p>

Thus, the Family Research Council strongly urges Congress to pass
legislation revoking China's &quot;most favored nation&quot; trade
status because of China's continuing human rights abuses.

<p>

It was seven years ago when 700 Chinese democracy-seekers were
ruthlessly gunned down at Tiananmen Square.  It was only last
year when Hong Kong newspapers reported that aborted human fetuses
were being cannibalized in China, sold as health food.  Last September,
directly before the United Nations Fourth World Conference on
Women in Beijing, the Chinese government executed nine prisoners
to &quot;send a message&quot; to their own people that they should
not attempt to demonstrate against the Chinese government.

<p>

In addition to these &quot;newer&quot; human rights violations,
other abuses which existed in China prior to their receiving MFN
status continue to go unabated.  For example, the Chinese government
continues to exploit prisoners for slave labor in their gulag
system known as &quot;laogai,&quot; as Harry Wu has demonstrated.
Mr. Chairman, it is these same slaves which make many of the
products which China exports for profit.

<p>

Furthermore, Chinese women continue to be forcibly aborted and/or
involuntarily sterilized.  It is well documented that women, even
in their eighth and ninth months of pregnancy, have been literally
dragged from their homes by &quot;family planning&quot; officials,
tied down with their feet in stirrups, and forcibly aborted.

<p>

China's one-child-per-couple mandate has also led to widespread
sex selection abortion, and unborn baby girls are most often the
innocent victims of this crime against humanity.  But even for
those little girls who are born alive, many are immediately abandoned
by their parents.  China has chosen to deal with this &quot;problem&quot;
of abandoned children by starving the little girls to death in
state-run orphanages.

<p>

Religious persecution also continues to abound in China.  As Family
Research Council President Gary Bauer testified before this Subcommittee
in February, Christians are systematically intimidated, tortured
and imprisoned in China.  Indeed, Amnesty International reports
cases of Christian women hung by their thumbs from wires and beaten
with heavy rods, denied food and water, and shocked with electric
probes.

<p>

These, Mr. Chairman, are crimes against humanity.  These are the
brutal and unjust actions of a communist regime to which our nation
has extended &quot;most favored nation&quot; trade privileges
for 15 years.

<p>

The failure of the United States to hold China accountable for
its heinous behavior has only encouraged the communist regime
to become more oppressive because it no longer fears that any
sanctions will be taken against it.  Year after year, the United
States has issued only empty threats against the Chinese government,
and in doing so, we have strained our credibility and undercut
our own stature as a moral leader in the world.  Indeed, the U.S.
has sent the shameful message that, as a country, we care more
about succeeding economically than about championing universal
human rights.

<p>

It is time for the United States to put teeth to our convictions
and revoke China's &quot;most favored nation&quot; trade privileges.

<p>
People in Washington have particular trouble, it seems, with words
that communicate the things we feel most deeply. We are currently
involved in a great controversy with one of our best friends.
Bill Bennett is a man I've honored and worked for. He has written
letters to Dr. James Dobson and conservative activist Paul Weyrich
taking sharp issue with them over the question of abortion.
<p>
Bennett is a wise man, a man of great learning and experience.
When he speaks, it pays to listen.  In speaking of abortion, Bennett
asks if it would not be better to support a candidate for president
who would actually speak out <I>against</I> abortion, a man who
would support teen abstinence programs that work, a man who would
champion adoption instead of abortion? Wouldn't such a man help
to lower the terrible toll of one and a half million abortions
a year, even if he remained committed to the continuing legality
of abortion? Wouldn't it be better to back someone of high moral
character, Bennett continues, someone who could mount the &quot;bully
pulpit&quot; of the White House in behalf of culturally conservative
ideals?  Isn't such a man <I>preferable </I>to the man who endorses
what Bennett calls the &quot;chimera&quot; of a human life amendment
while providing only &quot;lip service&quot; to the pro-life cause?
<p>
You must give Bill Bennett credit -- he knows how to pose a dilemma.
He's a thoughtful and provocative writer. I hope you will bear
with me if I take some time tonight to respond to the questions
Bennett poses.
<p>
We should welcome this debate. One of the things that has been
so dispiriting about the abortion debate in this country is the
intellectual dishonesty that attends so much of the discussion.
When the election of 1992 finally ended, columnist Charles Krauthammer
wrote that the abortion debate had been decided.
<p>
Many of us cried out that the abortion <I>debate</I> had never
even been held.  Bennett's message is an enticing one. Who among
us is not tired of the trench warfare we have been fighting for
the past 23 years? Isn't it very tempting to break out of the
exhausting and unproductive rut of &quot;politics as usual?&quot;
<p>
Of <I>course,</I> we seek the lowering of the number of abortions.
We know that one and a half million abortions a year is a tragedy.
But are we likely to take the steps necessary to reduce that terrible
toll if we don't think that <I>one</I> abortion is a crime?  What
we see today is the result of a cynicism by public figures. Stalin
said, &quot;A single death is a tragedy, a million deaths is a
statistic.&quot; Too many of our political leaders pay &quot;lip
service&quot; to the tragedy of abortion, but act as if it is
merely another item in the index of leading cultural indicators.
<p>
Of <I>course, </I>we would like to see a president who wholeheartedly
believes that abortion is wrong and who is willing to speak out
against it. A little history will help. America has never had
a president who thought <I>lynching</I> was nice. Most publicly
deplored it. But it was not until President Eisenhower signed
a civil rights law in 1957 that a president acted effectively
to put a stop to lynching. Would lynching have ended sooner if
Eisenhower had supported the choice of legal lynching while using
the White House to speak up for <I>alternatives to lynching</I>?
Ike and Mamie, culturally conservative as they were, could have
been the poster people for opponents of lynching. But it was <I>President
</I>Eisenhower's willingness to use federal marshals and federal
troops that assured the rule of law in such places as Little Rock,
Arkansas.
<p>
Bennett knows philosophy, so he would recognize Thomas Jefferson's
famous taunt. Mr. Jefferson said that if you put a moral question
to a plowman and a philosopher, the plowman would be more likely
to answer rightly. That's because the man who knows little is
closer to the truth than the man who knows many things that aren't
true.
<p>
One of the main things that isn't true is that we pro-lifers would
somehow <I>prefer</I> a president who gives us lip service instead
of solid and constructive action on a life-saving agenda. We were forced 
to <I>accept</I> such weak leadership: we never <I>asked</I> for it. To 
present us only two alternatives -- the pro-abortion president who, 
in his heart, thinks it should be discouraged and is willing to
say so publicly or the insincere pro-life president who pays mere
lip service to a human life amendment -- is to engage in the logical fallacy 
of the &quot;false dilemma.&quot;
<p>
Few people have given so much to our country as Bill Bennett on
a host of issues. When he was interviewed on Dr. James Dobson's
broadcast several years ago, Bennett gave us many wise insights.
On the troubling questions of gays in the military and women in
combat, no one can top Bennett. He told Dr. Dobson's 
listeners that there is a masculine, martial ideal. That ideal
calls upon men, in obedience to lawful authority, to take up arms in defense 
of the weak, the innocent, the vulnerable in order to restore justice
and peace. Bennett gave us an excellent summary of the &quot;just
war&quot; doctrine so wisely taught by Saint Augustine, and so
well elaborated by Martin Luther. Bennett went on: Those who seek
to recruit gays for the military and to place women in combat
seek the destruction of the masculine ideal, the feminine ideal
and the military they have always loathed. No one in American
life has understood these issues better than Bill Bennett, who
never spent a day in the armed forces. No admiral, no four-star
general, <I>not even one particular four-star general,</I> has
understood the challenge so well.
<p>
That is what is so deeply hurtful about the current controversy.
It <I>is </I>a family feud. And <I>you </I>are all part of the
family and you have a right to know what is being argued over.
But it is more than that.
<p>
We thought for a long time we would have to battle for the pro-life
planks in the Republican party platform.  We had no illusions
that the Arlen Specters, Pete Wilsons, Bill Welds and Christine
Todd Whitmans would let this brave statement stand unmolested.
But we never dreamed that we would have to defend the platform
from our friends.
<p>
What <I>does </I>the Republican platform say and why is that important?
Since 1976, the Republicans have been committed to a pro-life
position as a matter of party principle. It is vital that they
remain so. That is because no other major political party in the
world is so committed. Certainly not the conservatives in Britain,
nor the right-wing parties of France, Germany, Canada or Australia.
<p>
The platform adopted in 1984 and secured through 1988 and 1992
said that &quot;the unborn child has a right to life which cannot
be infringed.&quot; It pledged the Republicans to work for a Human
Life Amendment. It further urged the selection of judges at every
level who &quot;respect the sanctity of life and traditional family
values.&quot;
<p>
By saying that he could support a pro-choice president, Bill Bennett
has effectively moved to throw out the 20-year commitment of the
GOP to unborn human life. A platform is a statement the party
makes in advancing its candidates, particularly its presidential
ticket. Bennett has taken up the challenge, saying that we should
not pursue the <I>chimera </I>of a Human Life Amendment.
<p>
This is not the first time he has said this. Several years ago,
in response to a reporter's question on radio station KKLA in
Los Angeles, Bennett said of the pro-life plank that it was OK
with him if they wanted to put that in there. As a practical matter,
he said, it isn't going to happen. So what we should concentrate
on is reducing the numbers.
<p>
Well, as a practical matter, we are not going to get a Human Life
Amendment if our leaders disparage the effort. Scripture tells
us <I>where there is no vision, the people perish. </I>But I think
it a grave mistake to turn from leadership to punditry. We are
every day faced with extraordinary realities which few <I>practical
</I>observers would have predicted.
<p>
Take, for example, the collapse of the Soviet Union. Who, writing
the Republican platform of 1988, would have said the party demands
the reunification of Germany, her inclusion within NATO? Who would
have required the evacuation of all Soviet troops from restored
and sovereign Baltic states before the United States would give
Russia a penny in foreign aid? Anyone writing such a platform
plank in `88 would have been thought mad. But, by 1992, <I>no
platform could even be written </I>which did not take into account
the new <I>practical</I> realities.
<p>
From our own history, we know vast change is possible. In 1860,
the Republicans who met in this city to nominate Abraham Lincoln
and write their platform would not have dared to call for the
abolition of chattel slavery and the extension of U.S. citizenship
to the freedmen. But, <I>by</I> 1864, that change was a <I>practical
</I>reality.
<p>
We do not ask our leaders to do the impossible. We certainly do
not ask them to take us into war. But we do not want them to foreclose
the possibility of great and beneficial change in the <I>practical
</I>realities. 
<p>
The tragedy of Bill Bennett's defection is that it comes at a
time when we can see great and hopeful changes occurring. Naomi
Wolf, a feminist, pro-choice author, has written a remarkable
article in <I>The New Republic.</I> Entitled &quot;Our Bodies,
Our Souls,&quot; Miss Wolf's article is an unusual recognition
of the stakes in this vital question. She writes:
<p>
<blockquote><i>Norma McCorvey explained what happened to her in terms of
good and  evil; she woke in the middle of the night and felt a
presence pushing  violently down on her, &quot;I denounce you,
Satan,&quot; she announced.  This way  of talking about evil is
one of the chief class divisions in America:  working-class people
talk about Satan, and...those who run the country  talk instead
about neurotic guilt. While the elite scoff at research that 
shows most Americans maintain a belief in the embodiment of evil--&quot;the
 devil&quot;--they miss something profound about the human need
to make moral order out of chaos.</i></blockquote>
<p>
Miss Wolf is not an ally. She ends her article where she began
it: staunchly supporting what she calls abortion rights. But the
article is filled with amazing concessions and bold statements.
She dares to tell the truth that every abortion stops a beating
heart. And one word of truth, as Solzhenitsyn says, can move the
world. 
<p>
As if <I>The New Republic's </I>publishing this article were not
amazing enough, it was matched in September by a cover story in
<I>The Atlantic Monthly</I>. George McKenna is a law professor.
He urges pro-life politicians to recognize a woman's constitutional
right to choose abortion, but to take effective, practical measures
to restrict abortion. Ultimately, none of us can accept Professor
McKenna's position, but it is in the <I>laying out </I>of that
position that McKenna does the greatest service to all of us.
For he exposes to the light of day the absurdity underlying the
pro-choice arguments. He links them with the arguments made by
Stephen Douglas' Democrats in the 1850s. How marvelous in our
eyes. <I>Atlantic, </I>a flagship of the liberal prestige press,
has publicly accorded the anti-abortion position the dignity of
the Great Emancipator's cloak. This has not happened before.
<p>
While we are taken up, necessarily and painfully, with the fight
in our own divided house, we should not fail to note that our
adversaries' house is in shambles. Their leader thinks abortion
should be &quot;safe, legal and rare.&quot; If it is a fundamental
constitutional right, as the Supreme Court has told us it is,
then why should it be rare? Is there any other <I>fundamental
</I>human right which any of us would even wish to be rare?
<p>
Lincoln knew all about such hypocrisy. In 1860, he said:
<p>
<blockquote><i>Let us apply a few tests. You say that you think slavery 
is wrong, but you  denounce all attempts to restrain it. Is there
anything else that you think  wrong, that you are not willing
to deal with as a wrong? Why are you so  careful, so tender of
this one wrong and no other? You will not let us <b>do</b> a 
single thing as if it was wrong; there is no place where you will
allow it to  be even <b>called</b> wrong! We must not call it
wrong in the Free States  because it is <b>not</b> there, and
we must not call it wrong in the Slave States  because it is there;
we must not call it wrong in politics because that is  bringing
morality into politics, and we must not call it wrong in the pulpit
because that is bringing politics into religion; we must not
bring it into the  Tract Society or other societies, because those
are such unsuitable places,  and there is no single place, according
to you, where this wrong thing can  properly be called wrong!</i></blockquote>
<p>
Last year, the First Lady told <I>Newsweek</I> interviewers that
abortion was wrong. This was about a week before the mid-term
elections. In September, she went all the way to China to tell
the world that forced abortion is wrong.  One would think from
those statements that the wrong thing would not be included in
her health care plan. We might think that this wrong thing would
not be pressed on every country on earth by means of a diplomatic
cable to every U.S. embassy. We might even hope that this wrong
thing would not be pushed on U.S. military hospitals. Or we might
have thought that abortion would not be part of &quot;coordinated
community services&quot; targeted at public schools in states
which accept funds under federal <I>Goals 2000</I> legislation. From 
all these examples, it appears that their true goal is to make abortion 
safe, legal and <I>well done. </I> But, as Lincoln said, some of us are very
<I>tender</I> and <I>careful </I>about the things we call wrong.
<p>
How much we could have used Bill Bennett's strong voice in pointing
out such lethal inconsistencies. Instead, unfortunately, he has
said that it is Dr. Dobson and Paul Weyrich who are inconsistent.
They are inconsistent, he says, because if they <I>really </I>believe
that human lives are being unjustly taken in abortion, they would
be leading the public effort to put women in jail.
<p>
This is a painful wound, coming from a friend. It speaks volumes
about the circles that Bennett is moving in if he really believes
this. He should know better. Bennett knows American history. He
knows American law. He should know that in all of American history
we have found only <I>two </I>instances of women being prosecuted
for having abortions. The good, protective pro-life laws which
existed in every state until the early sixties, and which saved
the lives of millions of unborn children and their mothers, sought
to punish, discourage and stigmatize the <I>abortionist.</I> That's
the truth, and Bennett should know it. And if he doesn't <I>know
</I>the truth, we would at least appreciate his not taking his
debating points from Planned Parenthood's briefing book.
<p>
Bill Bennett had no greater supporters and enthusiasts than us
when he was taking on the hateful, violent and vulgar products
of gangsta rap. Those who sing about raping women and killing
cops should not be cultural heroes. And those who profit from
this execrable trade should be publicly shamed. And God bless
Bennett for doing it.
<p>
Now he has joined with Sen. Joe Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut,
to attack daytime TV talk shows. Again, we say, &quot;Good for
you!&quot; Bennett has called the toxic waste spewing forth from
the tube &quot;an affront to human dignity.&quot; How right he
is.
<p>
But, while he has Joe Lieberman's ear, could he put in a word
about <I>another </I>affront to human dignity?  Could he mention
to his friend how helpful his support would be in the fight against
partial birth abortions?  We must understand how inevitable a
degraded and violent culture becomes when we have accepted the
degrading violence of abortion.
<p>
We just won a great victory in the House, as you know. That vote
of 288-139 to ban partial-birth abortions spanned a broad spectrum.
We won the votes of Henry Hyde, Linda Smith and Helen Chenoweth,
to be sure. But we also gained the support of Dick Gephardt, David
Bonior and even young Patrick Kennedy. Bill Bennett should recognize 
that a pro-life commitment <I>can</I> be the source of great
strength. More than that, a pro-life commitment is the <I>only
</I>way a conservative majority can be sustained in this country. As Gary 
Bauer has noted, can Newt Gingrich point to any <I>other </I>bill that gained 
such strong support in the House?
<p>
Many of us, as pro-lifers, are powerfully moved by the fate of
unborn children. We identify strongly with the child in <I>The
Silent Scream.</I> We empathize strongly, and we want to help
defend and preserve the lives that are threatened with abortion.
We believe that God Himself has called us to do this work.
<p>
But there may be more arguments that can be made to the author
of such works as <I>The Book of Virtues </I>and <I>The Moral Compass,
</I>for one of the cardinal virtues that is wisely taught in the
great Catholic tradition is <I>justice. </I>Abortion is not only
violent and bloody. War is that. Abortion is also <I>unjust. </I>And
those who sit on the nation's highest court, who have told us
that the right to abortion is to be found in the &quot;liberty
interest&quot; of our Constitution, are not dispensing justice,
but <I>injustice.</I>
<p>
Lincoln was certainly moved by the fate of the poor slave. He
said that even a dumb brute, <I>even an ant,</I> knows when he
is wronged. But it was this conscious embrace of <I>injustice
</I>which Lincoln likened to a wen, a cancer, a dread disease.
If unchecked, Lincoln knew, it would one day claim the life of
the country itself.
<p>
It is also the federal judiciary which has so consistently undermined
law enforcement in our country. Small wonder, then, that when
justices are indifferent to justice, juries nullify verdicts and
people get away with murder. So, we must tell our neighbors, don't
expect that the blood-rimmed tide will ebb before it gets to <I>your
</I>doorstep. Making abortion legal makes America a violent, bloody
and dangerous place to live. Making abortion legal unravels the
very fabric of society.
<p>
Edmund Burke said we should love our country, that in order to
be loved our country should be lovely. A pro-abortion America
can never be lovely. How can we assert our own right to life if
we, as a nation, deny it to others?
<p>
I wish I could report to you tonight that the fight between Bill
Bennett and the rest of us is just--Washington loves this word--a
flap. I would be happy to say it will soon be smoothed over, and
we will all be friends again. But abortion is not simply an <I>issue</I>,
as Bennett sometimes calls it. It is no more <I>an issue</I> than
Pilate's calling for a choice between Jesus and Barabbas was a
straw poll. To say that we might advance our cause by choosing
leaders who don't understand or believe in our cause is to risk
all that we have accomplished in public policy, all that moves
us to take part in civic life.
<p>
So I am here to report to you that the mood of pro-lifers in Washington
is resolute, unyielding. And I sense that yours is, too. We are
ready to walk with you in the footsteps of the faithful. We will
not break faith with God or with you. If we suffer defections, broken 
friendships, that is regrettable. But that will not deter us.
Churchill, who knew what it was to stand alone, kept faith in
his time with the long history of Christian civilization against
a brutal, pagan tyranny. He would not speak of dark days, but
of <I>stern </I>days. These, too,  are stern days. 
I think we can win the fight for the Republican pro-life platform.
But, no matter what happens, I know that we will never give in.
Thirteen years ago, Jean Garton spoke to a right to life convention
in Connecticut. She spoke memorably then, as she always does.
Her word at that time was <I>reticulation</I>. She described it
as the veins in a leaf. If one was blocked, or cut off, others
could always take its place. So, if we are blocked in the political realm, 
we can still find paths of service. All that is needed is that we continue 
in the footsteps of the faithful. Thank you and God bless you.

<title>THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT: AN INSIDER'S VIEW</title>

<h2>THE<br>
DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT:<br>
AN INSIDER'S VIEW</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by<br>
Anthony Falzarano</i></center>

<p>

<i>This speech was given at a July 2, 1996 Capitol Hill briefing
regarding the Defense Of Marriage Act (DOMA).  The briefing was
sponsored by the Family Research Council.</i>

<p>

My name is Anthony Falzarano.  I am the executive director of
Transformation Ex-Gay Christian Ministries of Washington, D.C.
We are the Washington, D.C.-affiliate of the largest ex-gay network
in the world, Exodus International, which is based in San Rafael,
California.

<p>

I am here this morning standing in solidarity with the rest of
my colleagues to voice my strong approval of The Defense of Marriage
Act (more commonly known as DOMA).  I really find it incredible
that this bill would even have to come before the halls of Congress.
For many years the term &quot;marriage&quot; never had to be
defined because this country was founded on Judeo-Christian beliefs.
Our founding fathers looked to our heavenly Creator for His definition
of marriage in the pages of the Holy Scriptures in the following:
Genesis 2:24, Matthew 19:5, Mark 10:7, and Ephesians 5:31.  It's
a sad day for America when we would even have to debate this issue
publicly.  The United States of America has taken a dangerous
moral nosedive in the last 35 years and it's about time that we
say &quot;enough is enough&quot; to the enemies of this country
that we have allowed to infiltrate the halls of Congress with
their voices of destruction.

<p>

The politically-motivated homosexual movement in this country
has stepped over the line.  This movement is extremely well funded
and well connected.  It has been working for the last 30 years
like an army of termites, secretly eating away the floorboards
of moral integrity in this country.  It is time to expose the
agenda of these gay political organizations and call them what
they are -- evil.  The gay community shocked us in the 1970s by
coming out of the closet, gained our sympathy in the 1980s with
the horrible pandemic called AIDS and is now trying to force our
acceptance of their lifestyle using the legal system of this country.

<p>

I speak to you today not just as an observer of this movement,
but as one of them.  I am a former homosexual.  I lived that lifestyle
from the time I was 17 until I was 26.  I entered the gay lifestyle
thinking that there really wasn't any choice for me.  What I didn't
realize is that, although I didn't choose to be homosexual, I
did not have to be gay.  I had a choice.  I could change my orientation
from gay to straight.  My healing process was a long and difficult
one.  However, change is possible.  The four national ex-gay networks
are currently ministering to more than 10,000 former homosexuals.
Many of us are sick and tired of a lifestyle that initially seems
very freeing but eventually puts us in all kinds of bondage and
eventually will kill us.  I have lost over 35 of my friends and
acquaintances to the disease of AIDS and don't want to see one
more person become infected with this deadly disease.  The organized
gay community is telling us that AIDS is no longer a gay disease
and although it is spreading into the heterosexual population
in this country very quickly, 61 percent of people that are coming
down with this deadly disease in the U.S. are homosexual, according
to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.

<p>

The gay lobbyists in this country do not want DOMA to pass.  They
know that they cannot force the homosexual agenda into the organized
Christian churches in America (although they are trying), so they
are attempting to push their agenda on the American public and
the civil government using the argument that &quot;they are being
discriminated against.&quot;  I say that their cries of discrimination
have been grossly exaggerated.  When I was a homosexual, as long
as I didn't push my lifestyle into the face of my landlord, no
one kept me from getting an apartment.  As long as I didn't push
my sexual preference into the face of my employer, no one ever
denied me a job.

<p>

America must take a very strong stand against the very highly
organized gay community in this country by supporting The Defense
of Marriage Act.  If we don't say &quot;no&quot; to the organized
gay community now, the United States will suffer the consequences
of our complacency.  America needs to start helping homosexuals
recover from their sexual brokenness.  Putting a stamp of approval
on a lifestyle by legally recognizing it (and even calling it
marriage) is not really helping homosexuals.  It's perpetuating
a myth and delivering them over to a deathstyle.  Just take a
look back into the history books, when homosexuality was openly
accepted into the civil governments of the Greeks and Romans.
Shortly thereafter God passed judgment on those civilizations
and they ceased to exist.  Please don't allow history to repeat
itself.  America isn't bleeding spiritually, it's hemorrhaging.
Please don't allow history to repeat itself.

<h2>THE IMPORTANCE OF FAMILIES<br>
AND MARRIAGE</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<h4>Testimony of Robert H. Knight<br>
before the<br>
Senate Health, Education and Social Services Committee,<br>
State of Alaska<br>
regarding SB 308, which would amend the state's marriage statute<br>
March 18, 1996</h4></center>

Thank you for inviting me to testify on behalf of the Family Research
Council. I've been asked to give a brief statement summarizing
the importance of families and of marriage.

<p>

One of the Family Research Council's functions is that of a clearinghouse
on research about families. Over the years, we have seen studies
pile up to an overwhelming magnitude which show that children
do best in mother-and-father families, and that communities are
healthier where you find the most intact families.

<p>

Likewise, numerous studies show that marriage is a societal good,
leading to more fulfilled, and even longer lives. Typical is a
study in the <I>American Journal of Sociology</I> that finds married
couples have longer lifespans than unmarried people. The authors
conclude that &quot;for both sexes, the hazard of dying falls
significantly with marital duration, suggesting a cumulation of
the benefits of marriage over time.&quot; The researchers say
their findings are hardly surprising: &quot;The relationship between
marriage and death rates has now reached the status of a truism,
having been observed across numerous societies and various social
and demographic groups.&quot;[1]

<p>

The heart of family life is marriage, the key organizing principle
behind all civilization. Marriage, which brings the two sexes
together in a unique legal, social, economic and spiritual union,
has had special protection within the law and the culture because
it is indispensable to civilized life. No other relationship provides
society what marriage does. No other relationship transforms young
men and women into more productive, less selfish and more mature
husbands and wives, and fathers and mothers, than marriage. No
other relationship affords children the best economic, emotional
and psychological environment. Only as we have drifted from
the defense of marriage have we experienced soaring social problems,
such as divorce, illegitimacy, sexually-transmitted diseases,
and crime. The answer is not to push the envelope further but
to restore the primacy of marriage within the law and the culture.

<p>

Over the years, there have been attempts to redefine marriage
outside the one-man, one-woman definition. In the mid-1800s, some
people tried to legalize multiple-partner unions, but were soundly
rebuffed. In fact, the U.S. Supreme Court declared in 1885 that
any prospective state had to have law resting on &quot;the basis
of the idea of the family, as consisting in and springing from
the union for life of one man and one woman in the holy estate
of matrimony; the sure foundation of all that is stable and noble
in our civilization, the best guaranty of that reverent morality
which is the source of all beneficent progress in social and political
improvement.&quot; (<I>Murphy v. Ramsey</I>)[2]

<p>

Marriage is not something that can be taken lightly, or altered
without much impact. Same-sex proponents often point out that
some states once banned interracial marriage, but the comparison
is invalid. Skin color is inborn and benign, while sexual behavior
has everything to do with character, morality and society's basic
rules of conduct. Eliminating one entire sex from an institution
defined as the bringing together of the two sexes is a quantum
leap from eliminating racial discrimination, which did not alter
the fundamental character of marriage.

<p>

Marriage reflects the natural moral and social law which is in
evidence all over the world. No society has loosened sexual morality
outside of man-woman marriage and survived. Analyzing studies
of cultures spanning several thousands of years on several continents,
Harvard sociologist Pitirim Sorokin found that virtually all political
revolutions that brought about societal collapse were preceded
by a sexual revolution in which marriage and family were devalued.[3]
When marriage lost its unique status, women and children most
frequently were the direct victims.

<p>

Giving same-sex relationships or out-of-wedlock heterosexual couples
the same special status and benefits as the marital bond would
not be the expansion of a right but the destruction of a principle.
One can no more expand a definition of marriage than one can expand
the definition of a yardstick and still use it as a reliable measure.

<p>

If the one-man, one-woman definition of marriage is broken, there
is no logical stopping point for continuing the assault on marriage.
If feelings are the key requirement, than why not let three people
marry, or two adults and a child, or consenting blood relatives
of legal age?

<p>

Marriage-based kinship is essential to stability and continuity.
A man is far more apt to sacrifice himself to help a bona fide
son-in-law than some unrelated man (or woman) who lives with his
daughter. Kinship imparts family names, heritage and property,
secures the identity and commitment of fathers for the sake of
the children, and entails mutual obligations to the community.
Same-sex relations are a negation of the ties that bind, which
are the continuation of kinship through the procreation of children.

<p>

Even childless married couples retain the possibility of becoming
parents either biologically or through adoption, thus providing
children with role models of both sexes. Marriages benefit more
than the two people involved, or even the children who are created.
Their influence reaches children living nearby, as young minds
seek out clues to appropriate sexual behavior. Deliberately creating
motherless or fatherless families is not remotely in the interests
of children or the community, and benefits only a particular political
agenda.

<p>

Homosexual activist Michaelangelo Signorile put it candidly when
he wrote that activists should &quot;fight for same-sex marriage
and its benefits and then, once granted, redefine the institution
of marriage completely, to demand the right to marry not as a
way of adhering to society's moral codes but rather to debunk
a myth and radically alter an archaic institution....&quot;[4] Likewise,
homosexual activist Tom Stoddard admits that &quot;I am no fan
of marriage&quot; but he sees &quot;gay marriage&quot; as a way
of forcing society to accept homosexuality because marriage &quot;is
the centerpiece of our entire social structure, the core of the
traditional notion of 'family.'&quot;[5] But when homosexuals talk
about marriage and monogamy, they mean something different from
what folks usually mean. Evidence is overwhelming that few gay
couples are stable, and those that are, have an understanding
to have outside sexual contacts. Andrew Sullivan, the homosexual
editor of <I>The New Republic</I>, concedes in his book <I>Virtually
Normal</I> that homosexual relationships are quite different.
He contends that many homosexual households reflect &quot;greater
understanding of the need for extramarital outlets between two
men than between a man and a woman.&quot;

<p>

Clearly, those who care deeply about children, about morality,
about the well being of the larger society, must resist the attempts
by a tiny segment of the population to seize marriage for their
own purposes. The aggressors here are not ordinary people, who
are doing their best to live according to ages-old, time-tested
morality and family definition, but those who are trying to harness
the power of the law to force acceptance of their agenda. Individuals
struggling with same-sex desires should be accorded compassion,
but this does not mean they should be given a mandate to radically
redefine marriage.

<p>

Marriage must be protected, and creating counterfeit versions
would undermine the special status of marriage in the law and
in the culture -- to the detriment of children, families and, finally,
to civilization itself.

<p>

Thank you.

<title>TESTIMONY ON THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">

<h2>TESTIMONY ON THE<br>
DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<h4>Testimony of<br>
Gary L. Bauer<br>
President, Family Research Council<br>
on the Defense of Marriage Act (S. 1740)<br>
July 11, 1996<br>
United States Senate Judiciary Committee</h4></center>

<p>

Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for inviting me to testify.

<p>

As the head of an organization supported by 300,000 families,
I am often asked to provide information on various issues that
are important to family life, from tax credits to welfare reform.
But in all my years of pro-family work, I cannot recall an issue
that was so central to the very idea of family.

<p>

The Defense of Marriage Act would have seemed unnecessary and
even unthinkable just a few years ago, even though marriage has
been under siege for some time.  No-fault divorce, a sex-saturated
culture, and growing fiscal and social pressures have sundered
many a marriage or, in some cases, discouraged them from happening,
even with children in the picture.  Many Americans are wrestling
with the pain of broken families and are trying to rebuild their
lives.

<p>

The decline of marriage has spawned America's most destructive
social problems, as fatherless households have multiplied.  You
probably have heard the litany by now, but let me take a moment
to mention some of the devastation caused by a lack of support
for marriage: out-of-wedlock pregnancies, sexually-transmitted diseases, 
alcohol and drug abuse, educational failure, community decline, and 
last but not least, a frightening epidemic of crime that has changed 
the way we live.

<p>

A visitor from another land might well observe that we seem caught
in a quickening downward spiral.  As marriages fail, the pain
spreads out through the next generation to the ones that follow.

<p>

The solution seems self-evident:  If the collapse of marriage
is the problem, why don't we move to strengthen this irreplaceable
institution?  Well, we could and should.  Yet we are being asked
by some groups with a radical agenda to do precisely the opposite.

<p>

We are being asked not only to ignore the mounting evidence that
the mother-and-father family is the foundation of civilization,
but to weaken marriage further by redefining it.  We are being
asked to pretend that marriage is no longer about bringing the
two sexes together in a biological, social, economic, legal and
spiritual union.  We are being asked to restructure our entire
sexual morality and social system to embrace a concept that has
never been accepted anywhere in the world by any major culture.
We are being asked to pretend that somehow two men could replace
a mother in a child's life or that two women could take the place
of a father and that it won't make any difference to children.

<p>

Often I am asked, what does it matter if two men or two women
down the street want to call what they have &quot;marriage?&quot;
Why does that hurt you or your marriage?  Well it doesn't --
unless they bring the law into it.  Then the fiction is imposed
on everyone and the counterfeit will do great harm to the special
status that the genuine institution has earned.  There are many
relationships in which love is involved.  But marriage is a unique
bonding of the two sexes, with the probable expectation of procreation
of children.  It is the core of civilization and is universally
honored.

<p>

Marriage is more than a union of two people who have strong feelings
for one another.  Marriage establishes bloodlines, kinship, the
passage of family traditions and values through the generations,
the passing on of family names and property and it is the most
important source of social stability.  If we all existed for only
one generation, we would not have as strong a case for creating
legal and cultural safeguards for marriage.  But the protection
of marriage is not only about social harmony.  It is about creating
a future for our children.

<p>

Nobody is denied the &quot;right&quot; to marry.  They just have
to meet the requirements.  The two sexes must be present for it
to be marriage.  If that definition is radically altered based
on the &quot;feelings&quot; of those in other relationships, then
there is no logical reason for not letting several people marry,
or for gutting other marital requirements, such as minimum age,
blood relative status or even the limitation of the relationship
to human beings.

<p>

Marriage is blessed by all major religions as the union of a man
and a woman, so creating a counterfeit would be a slap in the
face to millions of Americans.  As George Washington observed,
government is not eloquence or suggestion; government is force.
If the government imposes a definition of marriage on all citizens
that runs directly counter to the teachings of the great religions,
it forces millions outside the civil law.

<p>

The state would be telling many, many people that their beliefs
are no longer valid, and would turn the civil rights laws into
a battering ram against them:

<p><ul>

<li>Businessmen and women would be prosecuted if they failed to
offer spousal health benefits to homosexual &quot;spouses&quot;.

<p>

<li>Children would necessarily be taught in schools that homosexual
relations represent the moral equivalent of marital love.

<p>

<li>Same-sex &quot;marriage&quot; would give a mighty tool to
those pushing for adoption of children in homosexual households.

<p>

<li>Private organizations like the Boy Scouts of America would
come under increased pressure to abandon their moral standards.

</ul><p>

We are here today because a few judges in Hawaii, against the
expressed wishes of the Hawaiian people, are poised to strike
down Hawaii's marriage law and legalize homosexual &quot;marriages.&quot;
Under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution,
it is likely that homosexuals from other states would fly to Hawaii,
get a marriage license and then come home, demanding the exact
same status as married couples in other states.  This would create
legal havoc and opportunities for further judicial mischief.

<p>

The Defense of Marriage Act merely puts the federal government
on record as defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman
as husband and wife, and it asserts Congress' constitutional prerogative
of interpreting the Full Faith and Credit Clause so that the other
49 states will not be forced to submit to a handful of judges
in Hawaii.

<p>

On May 20, in <I>Romer v. Evans</I>, the U.S. Supreme Court showed
how little regard some powerful jurists have for the right of
people to govern themselves in a democratic republic.  Congress
needs to act now to reassert the legislative branch's constitutional
role as the voice of the people and the maker of the laws.  It
needs to send a message to the Supreme Court and other courts
that they cannot be permitted to exchange morality for immorality
in the nation's laws.

<p>

In his powerful and eloquent dissent, Justice Scalia warned that
we are at a crossroads in which the very idea of a self-governing
federal system is hanging in the balance.  We cannot afford to
let judges usurp any more power and tyrannize an already besieged
moral code. The Defense of Marriage Act is a powerful antidote
to the destructive trend that has gripped this country at the
hands of some injudicious judges.

<p>

Finally, I would like to add that ordinary people did not pick
this fight.  They are not the aggressors.  They are merely defending
the basic morality that has sustained the culture for everyone.
Yet good men and women of varying beliefs have been subjected
to a barrage of name-calling and abuse simply for saying that
marriage ought to be the union of a man and a woman and that the
law should protect this vital social norm.  It is not hatred to
prefer normalcy.  It is not bigotry to resist radical redefinition
of marriage. It is not intolerance to believe in traditional
morality.

<p>

The Defense of Marriage Act is a matter of common sense.  It is
sorely needed.  I doubt that in all you do here, you will do anything 
more important. I urge you to give it swift approval so that the 
Congress can move to protect our society's irreplaceable institution.

<p>

Thank you very much.

<title>THE CASE FOR LIFE</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">

<h2>THE CASE FOR LIFE</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by<br>
Gracie Hsu</center>

<p>

This speech was presented before the Washington Health Policy
Fellows Program of the American Medical Students Association on
June 20, 1996 in Washington, D.C.</i>

<p>

The first principle of the Hippocratic Oath is &quot;do no harm.&quot;
That pledge, which each of you will undoubtedly take before you
become full-fledged physicians, is grounded in the simple truth
that human life is valuable and precious at all stages of life
and that the high call of the physician is to help preserve, not
destroy, human life.  This could also be the motto of the pro-life
community, for it is that truth which motivates, indeed, compels
the pro-life community to do what we do.

<p>

And what is it that we do?  In the words of Proverbs 31, we &quot;speak
up for those who cannot speak for themselves.&quot;  On the individual
level, we help women who feel they have no other choice but to
abort their unborn children to choose a better, albeit not easy,
alternative.  We seek to minister to her emotional, spiritual,
physical, and financial needs because many women have expressed
the fact that they chose abortion because they lacked the resources
to meet these needs.  Indeed, the Alan Guttmacher Institute reports
that women usually choose abortion for three main reasons.  Three-fourths
of respondents say that having a baby would interfere with work,
school, or other responsibilities.  Two-thirds say say they cannot
afford to have a child.  Half of the respondents say they do not
want to be a single parent or that they have problems in their
relationship with their husband or partner.

<p>

Thus, the pro-life community strives to meet the needs of these
women through crisis pregnancy centers.  These centers help pregnant
women one woman at a time.  They find out her needs, and seek
to help her choose life for her unborn baby by aiding her either
through an adoption process or by providing the soon-to-be mother
with material goods such as maternity clothing and baby necessities.
Counselors provide emotional and often spiritual support and
are committed to helping that mother for as long as she needs.

<p>

On the policy level, we seek to influence members of Congress
to uphold laws that acknowledge the humanity of the unborn and
overturn those laws which do not respect the moral opposition that the 
public holds against abortion.  Banning partial-birth abortions and 
amending the abortion mandate for medical school accreditation are just
two examples of our efforts during this 104th Congress.  I will
address each of these initiatives in more detail later on in the
presentation.

<p>

For right now, though, the most important thing that I want to
communicate to you is why pro-lifers do what we do.  There are
three main reasons which can broadly be stated this way:  (1)
Abortion takes the lives of unborn children; (2) Abortion hurts
women; and (3) Abortion is detrimental to society.

<p>

I realize that those are broad generalizations, but I'd like to
delve into each aspect individually here, in more detail.  We'll
tackle the first aspect first:  Abortion takes the lives of unborn
children.  This is the most well-known of the three arguments.
I'm sure you're all familiar with the saying that &quot;abortion
stops a beating heart.&quot;  Well, it does.  With the development
of modern technology and advancements in the fields of embryology
and perinatology, the public is being made more aware that a fetus
is far from &quot;a blob of tissue,&quot; but rather an unborn
human being which bears great resemblance to, nothing less than,
a baby.  Although this should not be news to you as medical students,
for many, the perception that abortion only removes a &quot;blob
of tissue&quot; persists.  At least one feminist has said that
the reason pro-choicers cling to that belief is because it makes
abortion more comfortable, more justifiable, if it can be grounded
in the denial that the fetus is really a baby.

<p>

Regardless of what people choose to think, though, abortion does
indeed take the lives of unborn children.  It was a realization
like this one, in fact, which gave Norma McCorvey, the &quot;Roe&quot;
of <I>Roe v. Wade</I>, pause to begin reconsidering her position
on abortion.  As Ms. McCorvey tells it, she looked at a whole
row of empty park swings one day and asked herself, &quot;Where
are all the children?&quot;  She suddenly thought, &quot;Oh no!
They've all been aborted!&quot;  This was the beginning of Ms.
McCorvey's journey towards a pro-life perspective.  Today, Ms.
McCorvey has not only disavowed her pro-choice stance, but she
has also become 100 percent pro-life.  She believes that life
should be protected at all stages, from conception until natural
death.

<p>

The second reason why pro-lifers do what we do is because abortion
hurts women.  As the previous example of Norma McCorvey shows,
many women are haunted by abortion, a condition now known as post-abortion
grief or trauma.

<p>

Another person who could tell you about post-abortion grief is
someone you would not expect.  Naomi Wolf, a self-proclaimed pro-choice
feminist wrote a brutally candid article in <I>The New Republic</I>
entitled, &quot;Our Bodies, Our Souls.&quot;  In it, she writes
about a Cornell-educated cardiologist who said:

<p><blockquote>

<i>I had an abortion when I was a single mother and my daughter
was 2 years old.  I would do it again.  But you know how in the
Greek myths when you kill a relative you are pursued by furies?
For months, it was as if baby furies were pursuing me.</i>

</blockquote><p>

This being pursued by &quot;baby furies&quot; is a common symptom
of post-abortion grief, as counselors from Project Rachel will
tell you.  Project Rachel, a post-abortion healing ministry, helps
both men and women find healing and forgiveness from their feelings
of loss and guilt.

<p>

The numbers of women who are experiencing this grief and who are
now willing to talk about it is reaching a critical mass.  That
is not altogether surprising considering the fact that 1.5 million
abortions take place in the United States every year.  (That's
more than 4,100 abortions every day.)  That amounts to a lot of
women who are hurting and grieving not only for the child they
have lost, but also over the weight of their own guilt.  Counselors
at crisis pregnancy centers are overwhelmed at the numbers of
women who come to them for post-abortion counseling.  These counselors
do their best to provide comfort to post-abortive mothers in their
grief, helping them find healing rather than internalizing their
guilt.

<p>

Men also suffer from post-abortion grief. <I>The Washington Post</I>
recently published an extraordinary first-person article by one
of its regular staff writers entitled, &quot;Remembering Thomas.&quot;
Phil McCombs writes:

<p><blockquote>

<i>When the abortion was performed, I was out of town on business
too.  I made sure of that.  Whatever physical, emotional and spiritual
agony the woman suffered, I was not by her side to support her.
I turned my face away.  My behavior was in all respects craven,
immoral.

<p>

For some instinctual reason, or just imaginatively, I've come
to believe that it was a boy, a son whom I wanted killed because,
at the time, his existence would have inconvenienced me. I'd
had my fun.  He didn't fit into my plans.

<p>

His name, which is carved on my heart, was Thomas.</i>

</blockquote><p>

The writer continues:

<p><blockquote>

<i>I feel like a murderer -- which isn't to say that I blame anyone
else, or think anyone else is a murderer.

<p>

It's just the way I feel, and all the rationalizations in the
world haven't changed this.  I still grieve for little Thomas.
It is an ocean of grief.  From somewhere in the distant past
I remember the phrase from Shakespeare, &quot;the multitudinous
seas incarnadine.&quot;

<p>

When I go up to the river on vacation this summer, he won't
be going boating with me on the lovely old wooden runabout that
I can't really afford to put in the water but can't bring myself
to discard, either.

<p>

He won't be lying on the grass by the tent at night, looking
at the starry sky and saying, &quot;What's that one called, Dad?&quot;

<p>

Because there was no room on the Earth for Thomas.

<p>

He's dead.</i>

</blockquote><p>

Phil McCombs found solace from his grief through Eileen C. Marx,
formerly communications director for Cardinal James A. Hickey
of Washington and now a columnist for Catholic publications.
He was able to undergo a &quot;healing process of recognition,
grieving and ultimately forgiveness.&quot;

<p>

Another way in which abortion hurts women is that it separates
men from their pregnant wives or girlfriends during the critical
time when many women most need their support.  Abortion has contributed
to the sense that women are alone in their decision-making.  This
is what happened to Thomas' mother.  Feeling a sense of abandonment,
many women choose abortion because they feel that they have no
other choice but abortion.   Indeed, the law states that abortion
is purely a decision between a woman and her 
doctor -- no spousal consent, no parental consent (in many cases).
As a result, though the father of that child is just as responsible
for helping to create the growing life in her womb, he is forbidden
from taking measures to save his child's life if the mother chooses
abortion.  On the flip side, he's also removed from bearing responsibility
for his child should she decide to keep the child.  He can very
easily say that if he gets a woman pregnant, it is of no consequence
to him.  Why should he feel any obligation to marry her or to
support that child if it is born?  After all, she could have gotten
an abortion.

<p>

Third, abortion is detrimental to society.  Abortion has changed
our perception about unborn life, hardening both men and women
to view a pregnancy first through the selfish lenses which ask
the question, &quot;How does this pregnancy help or harm <I>me</I>,
<I>my</I> future, <I>my</I> life?&quot;  Again, I will quote from
Naomi Wolf's piece, &quot;Our Bodies, Our Souls&quot; in <I>The
New Republic</I>:

<p><blockquote>

<i>The pro-life warning about the potential of widespread abortion
to degrade reverence for life does have a nugget of truth:  a
free-market rhetoric about abortion can, indeed, contribute to
the eerie situation we are now facing, wherein the culture seems
increasingly to see babies not as creatures to whom parents devote
their lives but as accoutrements to enhance parental quality of
life.  Day by day, babies seem to have less value in themselves,
in a matrix of the sacred, than they do as products with a value
dictated by a market economy.

<p>

Stories surface regularly about &quot;worthless&quot; babies
left naked on gratings or casually dropped out of windows, while
&quot;valuable&quot; genetically correct babies are created at
vast expense and with intricate medical assistance for infertile
couples.  If we fail to treat abortion with grief and reverence,
we risk forgetting that, when it comes to the children we choose
to bear, we are here to serve them -- whomever they are:  they
are not here to serve us.</i>

</blockquote><p>

Although a direct causal link cannot be made between the increase
in child abuse and abortion, there certainly is an association
between the two.  Since abortion became legal, the incidence of
child abuse has dramatically increased and the degree of abuse
has steadily worsened.  Perhaps it is because the two do share
a common philosophy that children exist for the parents' convenience
rather than as wards in need of parental protection and nurturance.

<p>

Each of these three broadly-defined reasons -- abortion kills
unborn human beings, abortion hurts women, and abortion is detrimental
to civilized society -- continues to resonate within the hearts
of most of us, even though like many of you, I have never known
a world without legalized abortion.

<p>

As an aside, Generation Xers seem to be even more troubled by
abortion than their immediate elders, the Baby Boomers.  But regardless
of age, public opinion polls show that the American population
at large is deeply troubled by abortion.

<p>

A September 1994 Gallup poll commissioned by CNN and <I>USA Today</I>
found that 65 percent of Americans believe that abortions should
either be &quot;illegal in all circumstances&quot; or &quot;legal
under certain circumstances.&quot;  Only 33 percent agreed that
abortions should be &quot;legal under any circumstances.&quot;

<p>

Similarly, a January 1995 CBS/<I>New York Times</I> poll found
that 60 percent believe that abortion should either &quot;not
be permitted&quot; or have &quot;stricter limits.&quot;  The view
that abortion should be &quot;generally available&quot; is shared
by only 38 percent of the population.

<p>

The dichotomy of &quot;pro-life&quot; vs. &quot;pro-choice&quot;
doesn't adequately reflect the sentiments of the American people
about abortion.  Both terms have become highly charged and badly
stereotyped.  The more accurate reflection of how the American
public feels about abortion is noted in their moral opposition
to abortion.  In other words, the debate does not hinge on the
legality of abortion, but on the morality of abortion.

<p>

This now leads me to address a couple of legislative initiatives,
because what Congress or the President does directly impacts the
American people as a whole -- the same American people of whom
a majority morally oppose abortion.

<p>

By far, the most widely-talked about initiative during this 104th
Congress was the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban.  Through this legislation,
pro-lifers sought to educate the American public first about abortion
itself and then about the specific partial-birth abortion procedure.
A majority of Americans had not been aware that abortion was
legal through all nine months of pregnancy for any or no reason.
The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban sought to show people that not
only was it legal for an abortion to occur throughout all nine
months of pregnancy, but also that a procedure as horrific as
a partial-birth abortion could be and was being used without sanction
or restriction.

<p>

For those who do not know what a partial-birth abortion is, it
involves aborting partially-delivered babies from four and a half
months into the pregnancy up to even the ninth month.  The procedure
consists of partially delivering the live baby feet first so that
all but the head is outside the mother's womb.  The head remains
in the uterus while the abortionist kills the baby by stabbing
surgical scissors into the base of its head, then suctioning out
the brain by a small tube, and then completing delivery of the
now-dead baby.

<p>

Ohio Registered Nurse Brenda Pratt Shafer, who has assisted in
three partial-birth abortions, describes the process this way:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Dr. Haskell brought the ultrasound in and hooked it up so that
he could see the baby.  On the ultrasound screen, I could see
the heart beating.  I asked Dr. Haskell, and he told me that,
&quot;Yes, that is the heartbeat.&quot;  As Dr. Haskell watched
the baby on the ultrasound screen, he went in with forceps and
grabbed the baby's legs and brought them down into the birth canal.
Then he delivered the body and the arms, all the way up to the
neck.  At this point, only the baby's head was still inside.
The baby's body was moving.  His little fingers were clasping
together.  He was kicking his feet.  All the while his little
head was still stuck inside.  Dr. Haskell took a pair of scissors
and inserted them into the back of the baby's head.  Then he opened
the scissors up.  Then he stuck the high-powered suction tube
into the hole and sucked the baby's brains out.  I almost threw
up as I watched him do these things....

<p>

I never realized how perfect these babies really are at this
point.  When you hear the word &quot;fetus,&quot; I think a lot
of people think, as I did, of just a blob of cells, or a mass
or something.  It was very revealing to me.  I don't think about
abortion the same way anymore.</i>

</blockquote><p>

The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban would make it a crime to perform
this procedure except to save the mother's life.  It is but a
modest first step in preventing the horror of late-term abortions.

<p>

According to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, the research arm of
Planned Parenthood, approximately 13,000 abortions every year
occur after the 20th week of pregnancy (four and a half months).
While it is not known how many of these are partial-birth abortions,
two abortionists, including Dr. Haskell, have said publicly in
different interviews that they have performed 3,000 &quot;late-term&quot;
abortions, including the partial-birth procedure, between the
two of them.

<p>

As you know, President Clinton vetoed the Partial Birth Abortion
Ban even though it passed both Houses of Congress, garnering support
from many avowed pro-choice advocates, including Reps. Patrick
Kennedy, Majority Leader Dick Gephardt, Susan Molinari, and others.
Indeed, New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan said that he
would vote to override the President's veto because, he said,
the procedure is &quot;too close to infanticide.&quot;

<p>

The second legislative amendment that I'd like to discuss received
very little press this year, but was nonetheless extremely important.
It was the Coats amendment to stop discrimination in the provision
of federal funds to those medical schools which choose not to
mandate abortion training.  Last year, the
23-member Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education
(ACGME) voted unanimously to pass new regulations mandating that
all medical residents specializing in obstetrics and gynecology
be trained to perform elective abortions.  Individual residents
expressing moral or religious objections would be able to opt
out of the abortion training.  However, medical institutions opposed
to abortion, such as Catholic hospitals, would still be required
-- in order to maintain their accredited status -- to provide
their students with abortion training by arranging for their students
to receive such training at another location.

<p>

Programs which fail to comply with the new
regulations risk losing their accreditation.  Accreditation status
qualifies teaching hospitals to receive federal reimbursement
for services which medical residents provide to patients.  Moreover,
doctors must ordinarily graduate from accredited training programs
to get certified as competent in their specialties.

<p>

ACGME's mandate would have substantively changed
the way in which most medical schools currently operate. The new
policy would mandate that 100 percent of medical schools provided
abortion training to their ob/gyn residents.  However, in 1991,
only 12.4 percent of medical schools provided first-trimester
abortion training on a routine basis; 56.4 percent of schools
offered it on an optional basis.  In terms of second-trimester
abortion training, only 6.7 percent of schools routinely offered
second-trimester abortion training; 58.7 percent provided optional
training.

<p>

Furthermore, about one-third of medical schools
currently refuse to provide abortion training due to moral and/or
legal reasons.  For example, Catholic-affiliated hospitals --
which make up about 20 percent of all U.S. hospitals -- do not
perform elective abortions because of religious and moral beliefs.
Other hospitals, such as the publicly financed Truman Medical
Center in Missouri, are legally prohibited from performing abortions
because laws in several states -- including Missouri -- bar the
use of taxpayer money to fund abortions.

<p>

It is a well-known fact that few physicians
are willing to perform abortions.  A Columbia University survey
found that nearly half of the ob/gyn chief residents graduating
each year have never performed a first-trimester abortion.

<p>

Commenting on the diminishing number of programs
offering elective abortion training, Dr. Richard Schmidt, a former
president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
(1977-1978) and residency review committee member, said that given
a choice, faculty and residents &quot;voted very clearly with
their feet&quot; not to perform abortions.

<p>

On behalf of those physicians who &quot;voted with their feet&quot;
and those medical institutions with moral objections to abortion,
pro-lifers succeeded in urging Congress to pass -- and the President
to sign -- a bill which would provide permanent protection for
medical schools that decline to provide abortion training.  This
law, first introduced by Senator Dan Coats, protects medical schools
from a loss of federal funds that would have occurred under the
ACGME's untenable directive.

<p>

In addition, pro-lifers have also worked to advance many other
legislative initiatives such as limiting federal funding for abortion
through the Hyde Amendment, promoting adoption as a pro-life alternative,
and halting human embryo experimentation, among many others. 
While I won't go into detail about these latter legislative items,
I hope that the discussion of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban and
the ACGME abortion training mandate has sufficiently served to
demonstrate how the pro-life community has been involved on the
policy level to promote a pro-life message.

<p>

In closing, I ask that each of you, as future physicians and health
policy experts, consider the case for life.  Examine closely the
role which you will play, for it may not be too far in the future
when you personally stand face-to-face with a decision regarding
abortion, or physician-assisted suicide, or fetal tissue transplantation,
or human embryo research.  Now, more than ever, technological
advances in medicine require physicians to give thought to ethical
considerations.  Thus, it is vitally important for each of you
to possess a moral grounding, an underlying philosophy for what
you choose to do.  I hope that I have given you some insight not
only into <I>what</I> the pro-life community advocates, but <I>why</I>
we so strongly believe as we do.

<p>

Thank you very much.

<h2>THE CASE FOR REBUILDING<br>
CIVIL SOCIETY</h2>
<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by<br>
Dr. Michael Novak</i></center>
<p>
<i>This speech was the keynote address at the Family Research
Council's &quot;World Without Welfare&quot; symposium on December
13, 1995 at the Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C.</i>
<p>
Thank you for allowing me to come to this important conference
and to share in the really central work of the Family Research
Council.
<p>
When we talk about welfare, it's good to make a distinction right
up front.  The war on poverty in the mid-1960s did make a real
difference for the elderly, for the sick, and for the disabled
that we shouldn't disregard.  It was in certain aspects a great
success for the elderly, for example.  In 1965, the largest group
of the poor were those over age 65.  In the 1960s, in John Kennedy's
campaign and when Michael Harrington's book was being bruited
about, pictures of the poor on the covers of <I>Life</I> magazine
or <I>Look</I> or other magazines of the time were inevitably
pictures of the elderly.  If you look today, by almost every measure,
the elderly are almost entirely out of poverty.  If there are
elderly poor, it's because they are not connected to systems that
are in place to help them.  Moreover, in 1965 we counted as elderly
all people who were 65 or over.  Today, the real worrisome part
of the elderly is the &quot;elderly elderly,&quot; the over 85s,
whose numbers have increased to proportions that are comparable
to the proportions of those over 65 just 30 years ago.
<p>
Now the financial aspects of this accomplishment, the funding
mechanisms that we used, are still serious problems.  And thus
we're quite worried about the future of Medicare and even the
future of Social Security.  But the programs in and of themselves
were a great success, and I think it's worth setting that aside
from our discussion for the moment -- although the funding mechanisms
do need a great deal of attention.  It is also true that the position
of the disabled and the sick is much better than it was just 30
years ago.
<p>
<center><h3>THE FAILURE OF AFDC</h3></center>
<p>
There is, nonetheless, a sense in which welfare programs have
dramatically failed.  When we say welfare, we typically mean the
poverty programs that were addressed to young people, young adults
between the ages of 16 and 45 in particular.  And the chief program
that has been worrisome has been AFDC, Aid to Families with Dependent
Children.  In the late 1930s when it was founded, AFDC was predominantly
a program for widows; and for many years afterward, 95 percent
or more of the people who received aid under that program were
widows whose husbands were hurt in mining accidents or mill accidents
or some other kind of accident.  Then after 1965, with great rapidity,
AFDC became a program predominantly for young single women having
children out of wedlock.  When we say welfare in America, when
the public hears that word, that's the part of the problem they
almost always fix on.  And it is very well worth fixing on.
<p>
The Family Research Council is one of the organizations that grew
up to respond to the insight that, if you help the family -- often,
I should add, unformed families not based on marriage -- you have
identified the surest and most direct safeguard against poverty.
If the family is healthy and functioning well, you don't need
what used to be called the Department of Health, Education and
Welfare.  That's what the family does when it's functioning well.
And when the family isn't functioning well, not everything that
all the Departments of Health, Education and Welfare do can make
up for the loss.  As I once put it, the family is the only Department
of Health, Education and Welfare that works.
<p>
Now, one of the insights that the public senses, but many critics
of welfare reform don't seem to grasp, is the sheer devastation
wrought by the programs we launched in 1965.  Those of us who
supported the War on Poverty, as I certainly did, did not warn
the citizenry that if you adopt this program we will bring you
a 600 percent increase in violent crime and a 500 percent increase
in births out of wedlock.  That wasn't our intention.  Nobody
foresaw that happening or wanted it to happen.  But that's what
did happen.  In other words, it's important to grasp the damage
that welfare is doing.  The reason for being concerned about welfare
reform today -- and trying to imagine a &quot;world without welfare&quot;
-- is not a budgetary reason.  It's not its cost.  The cost is
not insuperable.  If welfare were doing good, we would gladly
support it.  Most of us would.  I think the vast majority would.
What's disconcerting to people is that welfare is manifestly
doing harm.  Or, to put it another way, it's not achieving the
goods it set out to achieve.  And the problems it set out to address
are not getting better.
<p>
Witness John Kennedy's statement in early 1963 about the first
move toward welfare reform, which later became the War on Poverty
after his death.  The message he sent to Congress said it was
intended to strengthen the American family, to put an end to juvenile
delinquency.  Can you imagine how quaint a term that later would
become?  Who speaks of &quot;juvenile delinquency&quot;?  That's
a term from the 1950s and 1960s.  That's long gone.  It's violent
crime.  Juvenile delinquency was ended.  It became violent crime.
But those were the intentions of the program, and it failed to
achieve them.
<p>
I want to warn you to be careful here too.  It's very hard to
show that welfare has caused all the civic destruction that has
happened since 1965 among families we intended to help.  So many
other things happened, television and affluence and urban renewal.
It's hard to isolate any one explanation.  But at a minimum,
one can say that welfare in this narrower sense that I'm using
was aimed to address these problems and didn't succeed.  The problems
have grown worse than they were 30 years ago.
<p>
<center><h3>HALVING THE FAMILY</h3></center>
<p>
In Washington, D.C., where we are meeting, 64 percent of all pregnancies
end in abortion.  Of those young children who survive that, 70
percent plus are born out-of-wedlock.  Now the fact that they're
born out-of-wedlock means in reality that these youngsters will
be born without the presence of half of an extended family.  That
is, they will generally lack grandparents, uncles, and aunts on
one side of the family.  And on the woman's side of the family,
perhaps the family will be supportive.  Usually it is, but it
may not be.  But already the child's world is cut in half from
what a child would normally have.  And if the child is born into
a household which is disconnected from the world of work and disconnected
from neighbors who also work, that child is born without connections
to the world of work.  The prognosis for later employment is very
poor.  The health prognosis is poor.  The prognosis for finishing
school is poor.  The prognosis for involvement in the criminal
justice system is very high.  In this city, the chances of involvement
in the criminal justice system by the age of 30 are about 80 percent.
So those who want to continue welfare as we know it carry on
their shoulders a very heavy burden of proof.  I believe that
the Catholic bishops who are resisting some of the move for reform
are not facing as directly as they ought the moral responsibility
that accrues to them for continuing the program as it now is.
<p>
One of the worst features of the welfare program as it now is,
especially for the young, is that it takes good healthy young
people who are able to be creative and energetic and to show initiative
and it leaves them in a state of dependency in two respects. 
First, many of them are not there to be able to take care of their
children or their parents.  In other words, the healthy young
adults are usually the ones on whom the elderly depend, not on
whom children depend.  And for the most part, because they are
not working, they do not have the means to take care of those
who depend on them.  But secondly, this seems to bring with it
certain psychic wounds because many such people are not able to
be independent themselves.  They throw themselves on the care
of the government, on the care of the larger society, both for
the care of their dependents and for their own care.  And then
there's a third sense of dependency, too, for a very high proportion
of them.  While their schooling is free, they don't complete school.
Many become involved in alcohol or drugs and in other sorts of
behavior that are self-destructive. 
<p>
In all three of these senses, we have learned since 1965 that
poverty -- that is, a lack of material resources -- is not the
worst consequence but dependency in these three senses is much
worse.  It takes someone who ought to be a self-governing citizen,
self-reliant, brave, showing initiative, creating jobs, and leaves
them in the state of counting on others for the most basic things.
I hate even to bring up this aspect, but generally it leaves
them also with a great loss of spiritual morale, or self-esteem.
It's the self-esteem I hate to mention.  But it is in these cases
a very important reality with which to cope.  It's hard, when
you're not achieving, to have a sense of proper adult achievement.
<p>
America was never founded to be a society for dependent people.
The American experiment is an experiment in self-government,
and I want to talk about that in the second part of my remarks
now.  What it means to have republican government is to have a
government which allows most decisions, most social activities,
to be undertaken by the citizens themselves.  They're self-governing.
They are able to manage their social lives.  They are able to
manage their social necessities.  One of the most extraordinary
things about the founding of this republic, commented on by Tocqueville
50 years after the founding, is the capacity of Americans to organize
themselves to take care of their own needs.
<p>
<center><h3>ASSOCIATION: THE AMERICAN CHARACTER</h3></center>
<p>
My wife and I recovered the diary of an ancestor of hers.  Believe
it or not, his name was Charlie Brown.  He was the son of the
first Baptist missionary in the Iowa Territory before it became
a state, and Charles Brown writes in his diary day after day about
the importance of individualism, the importance of the individual.
But that's not what he describes.  What's in his head is how
much individual initiative it took to depart from the family back
east near Syracuse, and before that in Massachusetts, and to move
out to this new territory where the plow had not cut the soil
ever.  When he arrived, it was buffalo grass.  Not many people
lived there because the native Americans used it mostly as a hunting
ground.  It was not for farming, and most people passed on through.
Day after day, what Brown describes is like &quot;yesterday we
worked on the farm of so and so putting up a barn.&quot;  And
on another day they're putting a bridge over a creek.  And on
another day they're putting up the equivalent of a city hall.
And on another day they're working on the school.  The substance
of his days is working together with neighbors on projects to
make their common life go, to make it work.
<p>
What I'm trying to establish is that this is the building of civil
society.  This is the building of the ability of human beings
to live together in a good community when there's no government,
or only a very diminished form of government.  As Tocqueville
says, this is the great advantage the Americans had.  They were
so lightly governed.  The King and Parliament hardly paid them
attention, except to tax them.  They were organized first in villages
and townships and only much later in counties and states.  Only
after virtually 200 years were they organized in a federal government.
So, Americans learned how to conduct a social life for themselves
before they had government.
<p>
Tocqueville also remarks, in his reflections on the revolution
in France, that at the time of the revolution there were not 10
men in all of France who were capable of practicing the art of
association as Americans were.  What he meant by that was that
in France when something is needed people turn to the state to
do it.  And in Britain people turn to the aristocracy to fund
it. In America, they turned to one another.  They formed associations.
<p>
Tocqueville formed the principle that the first law of democracy
is the principle of association.  The very first law is that democracy
will only work where people are capable of self-government --
forming their own associations and making communal decisions,
and figuring out the mechanisms to make those fairly and well.
Tocqueville observed that people became practiced in the art
of association almost universally in America.  People formed associations,
he observed, to fund missionaries, to build colleges, to put up
buildings, to bring music to a village or town, to stage a play.
They formed associations for every imaginable purpose.  They
didn't turn to government because in the early days there was
no government to turn to, only a government of very limited resources
and very limited authority.
<p>
Now this is what our Framers intended by the experiment in self-government,
&quot;of the people, by the people, for the people.&quot;  For
this reason, governments are formed among men to secure these
rights. You do have to have a government, as the generation of
our Framers discovered for themselves when they were badly governed
by the Articles of Confederation.  They needed to form a more
perfect Constitution to form a more perfect union.  Their project
was not an anti-government program, in other words.  But it was
a matter of getting government right, and part of getting government
right was to leave space for people to govern themselves.  So
&quot;government by government&quot; would play as small a role
as necessary.  That is the original and has been the continuing
American experiment, and I think that the restlessness we are
seeing in the country is an urge to return to something like that
-- to &quot;devolve,&quot; as current rhetoric would have it.
Largely because of the great wars of the 20th century, the first
world war and the second, the federal government has far more
centralized power than anyone had earlier envisaged.
<p>
<center><h3>ESCAPING POVERTY THE FAMILY WAY</h3></center>
<p>
It isn't fair to say that all of our associations or social units
are voluntary.   Most are, but there are some that are given to
us by nature.  And one of those is the family.  I've already mentioned
the centrality of the family, but let me give you one more little
factoid that's impressive.  If you do three things in the United
States, it's very difficult to be poor -- less than a five percent
chance.  The first is to complete high school, which is free and
in fact mandatory.  In most states you can be picked up by a truant
officer for not attending school, but a substantial number of
people still don't.  Secondly, you are likely to avoid poverty
if you work full-time, even at a minimum wage job.   And finally,
you should get married or, with difficulty, manage to stay married.
<p>
Just a very few years ago, only about 6 percent of married couple
families were poor.  Today it's about 8 percent.  Marriage alone,
then, gives you a 92 percent chance of getting out of poverty.
The two incomes, in any case the support of two people, seem
to have some financial and also psychological power that is of
great assistance.  And, of course, with work and with at least
the minimum of a high school education, you do very well.  We
see this being realized every day.
<p>
One of the things that has changed the argument in the country
dramatically in the last 20 years is the influx of immigrants
from very poor backgrounds from all over the world.  They arrive
financially poor, but in a short time are <I>not</I> poor.  Their
success through family and work -- and particularly their success
in pushing their children in education -- has led them to move
out of poverty.  That in turn has restored our faith in the possibilities
within the American system for helping the poor regularly move
out of poverty.  What sticks in the craw of Americans, in fact,
is the vision before their eyes of so many people not moving out
of poverty.  That's what's uncharacteristic, that's what's unprecedented.
And that's what gives people the sense that the system is failing.
The system is meant to move people out of poverty within a decade
or so, a generation at most.  And when it's not doing that, that's
what makes people say there is something wrong with the system,
something we've done wrong in our design of it.
<p>
It's always wise to remind yourself that the vast majority of
people who are poor and who are on welfare are white.  The press
often tries to portray this as a &quot;black problem&quot; --
that is, they will frequently show black people when they talk
about welfare.  But any of you who come from states with more
rural settings, or states with smaller towns and cities, know
the increase in welfare among whites all over the United States.
Even the increase of illegitimacy today among whites is now higher
than it was in 1965 when Daniel Patrick Moynihan declared it a
disaster among blacks.  It's now higher among whites and growing
more rapidly than among blacks.
<p>
The family, therefore, is one of the crucial places to apply our
attention.  This is not habitual among social scientists and American
intellectuals in general.  Political thought for the last 200
years has been more or less mesmerized by the two great discoveries
of the last 200 years: the nation-state and the individual.  For
the first time in history, a great many individuals moved away
from their families through migration or through the opening up
of new occupations.  They moved into occupations untraditional
in their family.  Sometimes they changed their religious background.
It's been a hugely migratory two centuries.  All of us here are
a part of that migration to the United States over a very short
period, the greatest migration in human history. We became aware,
therefore, of separating from family, of being an individual.
And there are many other factors that led to this as well.  
<p>
<center><h3>&QUOT;THE GREAT DRAMATIC MIDDLE&QUOT;</h3></center>
<p>
But simultaneously, we became aware of the formation of the nation-state.
And thus by and large progressives -- liberals as we tend to
call them in this country -- when presented with a problem, typically
tend to think of a state solution for it.  And on the other hand,
conservatives faced with a problem typically have tried to think
of something that the individual could do.  And our social thought
has been oscillating between these two extreme views: the individual
and the state.  We have overlooked the great dramatic middle in
which most human life is lived.
<p>
I don't know about you, but practically the only place I get to
be alone is on an airplane.  And I get to be alone only after
I answer two questions.  The person next to me always eventually
says, &quot;What do you do?&quot;  And I figured out the answer
that stops most of them cold.  I say, &quot;I teach,&quot; in
roughly that tone of voice.  Most of them have dreadful memories
of school, and that usually ends the conversation right there.
A few of them are brave souls and they will say, showing their
sophistication, &quot;What do you teach?&quot;  And I have a perfect
answer for that too.  I say, in as brief a voice as I can, &quot;Humanities.&quot;
And they say, &quot;Oh.&quot;  And that's it, I'm free.  There
are no committee meetings and no telephones.  For an hour and
a half or four hours, or whatever it is, I have the first solitude
I've had in days.  The rest of the time seems to be spent in committees
and meetings.  Most of our time is spent with other people.
<p>
American life is probably the most social life in the world. 
One of the most difficult tasks in America is getting the whole
family to sit down together at the dinner table because somebody
always has band practice or hockey practice, or a meeting.  And
if you want to get one night together, you almost have to enforce
it the way the Mormons do.   It has to be a family night, and
everybody must be home.  I had an Italian friend, and I asked
him why he came to work in &quot;Cleave-a-land,&quot; which is
how he said it. &quot;To make money, to find fortune,&quot; he
said.  &quot;And why did you go back to Italy?&quot; I asked.
&quot;To live,&quot; he said.  In Italy you take a shave and
a haircut -- two hours.  In America, eight minutes.  In Italy
you have dinner all evening -- four hours, normal.  In America,
in the evenings you're at meetings.  He said the trouble with
America is that you work eight hours a day and then you go to
eight hours of meetings.  We're a very social people, with our
families and all the different organizations and groups that we
belong to.  We live a richly social life.
<p>
It's not a community life in the way the Europeans imagined community,
however.  When the Europeans imagine community they always think
of a village somewhere in the mountains where everybody shares
the same faith and the same outlook and families have known one
another for hundreds of years and are almost like family together.
That's the European sense of community.  It is not, I think,
the highest sense of community.  It's a lovely form of community,
but it is quite oppressive and often xenophobic.  It distresses
others, and it is often repressive of the talents and abilities
of rare people within it.
<p>
Well, to pick up the theme I began with, the family, the association,
the capacity of Americans to look around, see a need and form
an organization to meet it -- that is what a &quot;world without
welfare&quot; is going to call on Americans to do more and more.
My friend Phil Merrill, who is the publisher of the <I>Washingtonian</I>
and other newspapers in this city and a shrewd observer of life,
predicts that in the next 20 years there's going to be the most
massive transfer of wealth in the history of this republic.  He
points out, &quot;Just look at pictures of the city of Washington
30 years ago and overlay them with a photograph of today.  Look
at how many new buildings have gone up.  Look at areas like Bethesda
and Falls Church and the whole surrounding area that were residential
communities and today are bustling communities with factories
and offices of every sort all over.  Think of the fortunes that
have been made in auto dealerships and real estate.&quot;  People
have more money than they are going to be able to leave to their
children.  Most of that money will go into the greatest outbreak
of philanthropy that the country has ever known, and therefore
that the world has ever known.
<p>
The stock market, in the 12 months of this year, has gone up one
trillion dollars of new wealth.  It's just astonishing what is
going on around us.  New industries, new technologies that were
not even thought of, are coming on-line.  When people talk about
our children being worse off than we were when we grew up and
lacking the same opportunities, they are overlooking the wealth
in home ownership and pensions -- the hidden forms of wealth that
are not usually counted.  When you see these comparisons of the
concentration of wealth, they almost all leave out your home,
your personal possessions, your compact discs.  What most of us
count as our wealth isn't counted.  What they count as wealth
is stock ownership, which some 20 to 30 million American families
have, but not everybody.  Thus, those studies have a necessary
conclusion that wealth is concentrated because they count only
a certain kind of wealth.
<p>
<center><h3>CATS, CHOICES, AND CHARACTER</h3></center>
<p>
Now, the last requirement of a self-governing society -- beyond
the capacity to form associations, to strengthen families, and
to form associations to meet whatever needs we discern -- is the
personal requirement.  The project of self-government will only
succeed with a certain kind of people.  It's a fantasy, Madison
said, to imagine that a republic can be made to work without virtue.
Now by the word &quot;virtue,&quot; the Framers meant certain
habits that a people must have if it wishes to be a free people.
They thought that there are peoples on this planet who are not
capable of liberty because they do not have the habits of self-government.
And they, therefore, will not be able to make self-government
work.  Now what did they mean by &quot;self-government&quot;?
They meant the capacity for two actions in particular.  Out of
all the things human beings do, there are two that are most particular
to our being human.  One is the capacity for reflection or deliberation.
And the other is the capacity for choosing.  And the two together
are what make liberty.
<p>
The capacity for deliberation or for reflection is a simple one.
I can best explain it in relationship to the two cats we have
at home.  I hate cats, you have to understand.  But our daughters
when they were 6 and 7 years old, each brought home a cat and
begged us to adopt them, lest they meet a terrible fate.  They
promised they would take care of the cats forever, and the parents
would never have to do anything.  The only problem is our children
are grown up and gone, and we still have the cats.  We can't even
leave home without finding a catsitter.  One is orange, and one
is black and white.  One is thin, and one is fat.  And one is
quick, and one is slow and dimwitted.  There's no question that
our cats have different personalities.
<p>
On the other hand, there's one thing we never have to worry about,
as we do have to worry with our children -- What career are they
going to choose?  Our children act.  They think of things that
we wish they wouldn't think of and then do them.  Our cats, on
the other hand, behave as cats always have since the time the
first one posed for the Sphinx.  In 5,000 years, cats have done
nothing original.  It's behavior.  Our children are capable of
reflecting on the future, seeing alternatives and choosing among
them.  They're capable of looking back on the past and finding
things that they're sorry for and things they're pleased with
and happy about.  That capacity to reflect is crucial to liberty.
<p>
Our Framers distinguished between two different kinds of liberty.
Tocqueville points this out in the first pages of <I>Democracy
in America</I>: the liberty proper to animals and the liberty
proper to human beings.  Our cats just do what they please.  Whatever
instinct tells them to do, they do.  They cannot do other than
obey their instincts.  Human beings have several different sets
of instincts which are at war with one another.  And human beings
have to choose which instincts to follow.  The capacity for self-government
is the capacity to choose under the light of reflection and deliberation.
The French built the Statue of Liberty to reflect this new idea
of liberty.  The idea of &quot;libert&eacute;&quot; failed in
the French Revolution, but the idea of liberty succeeded in North
America -- the kind of liberty that Pope John Paul II has insisted
on calling Ordered Liberty ever since his first visit to America.
That, he said, is the great contribution of American civilization
to world civilization.  The concept of the practice and institutions
of ordered liberty.
<p>
The French didn't know what sort of monument to build.  They wanted
to build one of the great monuments of the world.  They formed
a committee.  Being French, their first decision was easy.  It
would be the figure of a woman.  A woman is the symbol of liberty
in French oceanography from at least the fifth century.  Not the
young male with a weapon, but a woman, Lady Wisdom.  In her right
arm, they put the torch of reason, of light against the mist and
fog of bigotry and passion and ignorance.  And in her other arm
they put the book of the law.  Liberty under reason, liberty under
law.  It's a distinctive understanding of liberty.  To be free
is to act from reflection and deliberation, which is hard.  Often
we act out of instinct, out of passion, out of impulse.  But to
act soberly with reflection and self-mastery, as Jefferson and
Washington are described, is the very model of self-government.
Now how, Madison asked, can you have self-government in the republic
if you don't have self-government in the citizens?  You can't
imagine that a people incapable of self-government in their private
lives can practice self-government in their public lives.
<p>
Now I think what we need to understand is that this is our model
for the poor.  It always has been -- just as it has been for the
rich.  The capacity for self-government, the capacity for a certain
independence, for reflective and deliberate behavior, and the
acceptance of the consequences of decisions.  And that's exactly
what our current welfare programs have destroyed in large numbers
of people.  And poor people coming from around the world see this
and tell themselves, &quot;Stay off welfare.  It's a honey trap.
It can so easily destroy.&quot;
<p>
<center><h3>TOWARD A &QUOT;WORLD WITHOUT WELFARE&QUOT;</h3></center>
<p>
Well, when we talk about reconstituting civil society, that's
our agenda.  It's an agenda on a very full spectrum.  Everything
from recovering the habits that Bill Bennett tried to bring to
our attention in the <I>Book of Virtues</I>, to renewing the spirit
of volunteerism, the habit of Americans to look around and see
what needs doing, and then do it themselves without turning to
government.  If we have government help, then we will often need
to find ways of having the government help indirectly rather than
directly.  Rather than giving direct subsidies, we should find
an indirect way of helping institutions that encourage the independent,
self-reliant, community-minded behavior that is proper to self-government.
We need a whole new imagination about what we're going to ask
of government and how we're going to ask it to help.
<p>
We know that in a society as mobile and intercontinental as we
are, there are going to be people who fall through the net.  Families
aren't going to be there to help them because they're far from
their families.  In this sense, we understand that there has to
be a welfare net of some kind.  But how to provide this help?
It does not have to be done in the manner in which it has been
done for the last 30 years.  We've succeeded for the elderly,
but it was a grand failure for young people despite all good intentions.
So our agenda is a very large one, and it's useful as we begin
these reflections for the day to keep in mind how many different
things we have to do at once.  It's an entire rethinking, reformulating
or reconstituting, of the American experiment -- something that
Jefferson said that we ought to do every 18 and a third years
just on principle.  Thank you very much.

<title>WHY WE NEED THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT</title>

<body>

<h2>WHY WE NEED THE<br>
DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by<br>
Robert H. Knight</i></center>

<p>

<i>This speech was presented at a July 2, 1996 Capitol Hill briefing
regarding the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA).  The briefing was
sponsored by the Family Research Council.</i>

<p>

The thing I hear most often in debates about the Defense of Marriage
Act is, &quot;Who will it hurt if two gays or two lesbians down
the street want to share their love?&quot;

<p>

Well, if you put it that way, the answer is almost nobody, if
they keep it entirely to themselves and their behavior does not
involve the transmission of AIDS and other diseases that are epidemic
among homosexuals. That is probably unrealistic.  And they hurt
themselves in living a less fulfilling life.

<p>

Most Americans believe in the philosophy of  &quot;live and let
live.&quot; They don't want to make the plight of homosexuals
any more difficult than it already is.  But tolerance is not what
homosexual activists are seeking.  They are demanding that society
elevate homosexuality to the moral level of marriage.   When they
bring the law into it, they are no longer just minding their own
business but imposing it on every single citizen.

<p>

If you are a devout Christian, Jew or Muslim, or merely someone
who believes homosexuality is immoral and harmful, and the law
declares homosexuality a protected status, then your personal
beliefs are now outside civil law.  This has very serious implications,
for if the law declares opposition to homosexuality as bigotry,
then the entire power of the civil rights apparatus can be brought
against you.

<p>

Businessmen will have to subsidize homosexuality or face legal
sanctions.  Schoolchildren will have to be taught that homosexuality
is the equivalent of marital love.  Religious people will be told
their beliefs are no longer valid, and their independence will
be challenged.

<p>

While homosexuals say they want only tolerance, they are being
dishonest.  They already have tolerance, but are aiming for government-
and corporate-mandated acceptance.  Where gay rights have become
law, people of conscience are already being targeted for punishment
in the name of &quot;diversity&quot; training.

<p>

The Boy Scouts of America are under legal attack in the states
which have special rights for &quot;sexual orientation.&quot;
The Scouts, a private group, are being told to abandon their
moral code of more than 80 years and to place young boys under
homosexual men on camping trips -- or face financial ruin.  The
attack against the Scouts is really an attack on parents, because
parents have the right, in a free nation, to entrust their children
to organizations that reflect the parents' most deeply held beliefs.
If they cannot do this, then we are living in tyranny.  That
is the real, ugly side of gay rights that the media will not show
-- the tyrannical reality.

<p>

Here's an example of where we are headed.  In Hamilton, Ontario,
the mayor was asked by homosexual activists to declare a &quot;gay
pride week.&quot;  Hamilton being a blue-collar, largely Catholic
town, the mayor declined.  He was hauled before a human rights
commission, personally fined $5,000, and told that he had committed
the crimes of &quot;gay bashing&quot; and hatemongering.

<p>

If homosexuals achieve the power to force others to pretend that
their unions are &quot;marriages,&quot; then people of conscience
will be told to ignore their God-given beliefs and to support
what they regard as immoral and destructive.

<p>

Homosexuality has been discouraged in all cultures because it
is inherently wrong and harmful to individuals, families and societies.
The only reason it has been able to gain such prominence in America
today is the near blackout on information about homosexual behavior
itself.  We are being treated to a steady drumbeat of propaganda
echoing the stolen rhetoric of the black civil rights movement
and misrepresenting science.

<p>

Here are some of the myths:

<p>

<b>The 10 percent estimate of homosexuality in the population.</b>
Based entirely on the discredited Kinsey studies, the figure
is a fiction.  The reality is nearer to 1 percent or, at most,
2 percent.

<p>

<b>Genetic studies.</b> Activists say homosexuality is just
like skin color.  But there are thousands of former homosexuals,
but no former blacks or Hispanics.  Virtually all gay genetic
studies have been done by homosexual activists.  All have huge
methodological flaws, and many point to the opposite conclusion
-- that homosexuality is a learned behavior rather than in-born.

<p>

<b>Gay teen suicide.</b> We are told that one in three teen suicides
are gay teens, but this comes from a single report that was repudiated
by Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan.  Other
studies repudiate the figure as well.

<p>

<b>Psychological studies.</b> In the 1950s, UCLA psychologist
Evelyn Hooker conducted three tests comparing groups of 30 hand-picked
homosexual men with 30 randomly-selected heterosexual men.  In
two of the three tests, the gays were easily picked out because
they sexualized their drawings.  Yet this study was cited in 1973
as the centerpiece of research leading the American Psychiatric
Association and the American Psychological Association to remove
homosexuality from their lists of emotional disorders.

<p>

<b>Hospital visitation.</b> Homosexuals claim that they have
difficulty visiting loved ones in hospitals because families have
primary visitation rights.  Yet an informal survey of hospitals
in the Washington, D.C. area and other metro areas reveals that
no homosexuals are being denied any visitation rights.  A Nexis
search of July 2, 1996 also shows no news stories about homosexuals
being denied visitation rights.  It's a non-issue manufactured
to foster the &quot;victim&quot; image that homosexuals use to
advance their agenda.

<p>

<b>Military security studies.</b> During the debate over gays
in the military, the government unveiled a study that included
a chapter on the moral history of America.  It was full of anti-religious
sentiment and was written by a man who sits on the board of a
journal that promotes man-boy sex.

<p>

<b>Gay parenting studies.</b> Conducted and evaluated by lesbians
or homosexuals, these studies have major problems, but even so,
indicate that children in homosexual households are four times
more likely to identify as homosexual or get involved in homosexual
behavior than children raised in single-parent households.

<p>

I could go on.  Suffice to say, America is being fed a diet of
propaganda that has gone largely unexamined by major media.  The
point is to create the falsehood that homosexuality is normal,
healthy and of no consequence, and should be accorded the same
treatment in the law as benign characteristics such as skin color
or ethnicity.

<p>

The language of gay rights is tolerance, but the aim is raw power
to criminalize dissent from the view that &quot;gay is good.&quot;
In the name of freedom, this agenda must be exposed and halted.
A good place to start would be the passage of the Defense of
Marriage Act.

<h2>EFFECTIVE COMPASSION</h2>
<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by<br>
Dr. Marvin Olasky</i></center>
<p>
<i>This speech was presented at the Family Research Council's
&quot;World Without Welfare&quot; symposium on December 13, 1995
at the Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C.</i>
<p>
This is somewhat of a difficult assignment for me.  At this point,
the only time I get nervous in speaking is when my wife is in
the room.  My goal in life is to try to please her, and I start
to wonder and worry.  As I look around the room here today, I
see not my wife -- she is happily warm in Texas -- but so many
other people from whom I've learned so much and whom I honor.
John Perkins over here, who has been doing wonderful things for
30 years.  Wayne Gordon with the Christian Community Development
Association.  Guy Condon with Care Net.  Duane Higgins in Alabama.
Reverend Ron Moore in Mississippi.  Father Sirico of the Acton
Institute in Michigan.  Bill Schambra from the Bradley Foundation.
Reverend John Woods and Mrs. Woods from the Gospel Mission here
in Washington.  I was noting down the people as I came in the
room.  It just goes on and on.
<p>
So what can I possibly do to explain what's going on to all these
folks from whom I've learned so much?  Just a few thoughts.  And
this may not be the best-organized speech you will have heard
this year, but it comes from the heart.
<p>
<center><h3>WELFARE: THE THIRD CHARGE</h3></center>
<p>
I start out by thinking about all the people here who are not
only well-intentioned but also intent on seeing good results,
who understand the difference between effective compassion and
what is well-intentioned but often does exactly the opposite of
what it sets out to do.  I have found in traveling around the
country this year lots and lots of soft hearts, wonderfully soft
hearts.  But, alas, they tend to go along with soft heads.  You
see this in church bulletins with notices about helping the homeless.
Here are three that have been brought to my attention this year.
First, &quot;Thursday night:  dinner for the homeless.  Medication
to follow.&quot;  Here's another, &quot;At the evening service
tonight the sermon topic will be 'Seeing Hell Close Up.'  Come
early to meet homeless visitors.&quot;  And one more, &quot;Don't
let homelessness kill you.  Let the church help.&quot;  A lot
of good intentions, a lot of soft hearts, some soft heads as well.
<p>
This is a wonderful hotel to be meeting in.  This is the hotel
where U.S. Grant used to hang out when he came here right after
the Civil War -- or as we call it in Texas still, the &quot;War
of Northern Aggression.&quot;  U.S. Grant, when he stayed here
following the Civil War, did not have much of a sense of humor.
But you could excuse him for that.  He had seen too much during
that terrible war in which 600,000 soldiers died.  Recently I
visited the Cold Harbor Battlefield southeast of Richmond.  That's
the one where Grant ordered three frontal assaults against strong
Confederate positions.  It was obvious to the soldiers that they
could not make it.  It was so obvious that they sewed their names
and addresses to the backs of their uniforms before the battle
so that their bodies could be identified and the next of kin notified
more easily.  Grant later said that his biggest regret of the
whole war was ordering that third charge.  The first, maybe, just
to see whether it could be done.  The second, dubious.  The third,
just a total tragic disaster.  The body count just went on and
on.  People stacked up in an area the length of about a football
field and the width of maybe a couple of fields.
<p>
At least U.S. Grant admitted that he had made a mistake.  And
that is far more than some liberal defenders of the welfare status
quo are now doing.  The <I>Washington Post</I> yesterday had a
headline, &quot;Daschle Says Final Welfare Plan Has Lost Democratic
Support.&quot;  And so all that's left apparently is to defend
the status quo.  That should be an oxymoron:  a liberal defender
of the status quo.  That's a combination that is not quite right,
like &quot;dry rain&quot; or &quot;trustworthy Clinton.&quot;
But alas, the liberals who come from such a proud tradition of
looking at the horizon, going where no man has gone before (or
at least sometimes no sane man), are now left with defending the
status quo.  Liberals, with this wonderful tradition of so much
progress, particularly in racial matters, are defending the status
quo.  How the mighty have fallen.
<p>
It's even worse.  We saw through the 1970s and the 1980s how children
suffered as families dissolved or never were formed by people
who had the consciousness of the sixties.  Some had soft hearts,
but many had soft heads.  And now in the '90s, the last refuge
of liberalism with its great tradition is to defend the status
quo and to push forward the children again as hostages.  The body
count of those children over the last 30 years is enormous.  They're
stacked up like soldiers were at Cold Harbor.  But liberals' last
refuge is to go at it again.  It is a third charge at Cold Harbor,
and at least the folks who defend the status quo could have the
decency to sew the name tags on the backs of those children.
<p>
<center><h3>THE COMPASSION DEFICIT</h3></center>
<p>
As you can see, I'm not fond of what passes for the Democratic
position these days.  But I can give only one or two cheers for
the Republican position because conservatives have not really
taken advantage so far of the opportunities to replace welfare
that have been created by the failure of liberalism.  Many conservatives
are still content to be the party of hardheadedness and, in perception
and sometimes reality, hardheartedness as well.  They tend to
say, &quot;Okay, we're hard.  We have hard heads.  Maybe we have
hard hearts, but you folks on the other side have soft heads and
soft hearts, and when it comes right down to it the voters will
prefer hard-hard to soft-soft.&quot;  Well, maybe they're right
politically.  I tend to think not.  I don't think they'll be successful
in retaining public confidence long enough to really end the budget
deficit if they do not deal with the compassion deficit.  And
that's something the Republicans have not really dealt with yet
for the most part.  Maybe they can get away with it politically,
hard-hard versus soft-soft, but what's right and what the American
people want are folks who are warmhearted but tough-minded.  People
want that combination, and so far neither party has really been
producing it as its main position.  And so, conservatives need
to realize that cost is not the main reason at all to fight governmental
welfare programs.  It's a factor certainly.  It becomes a huge
tax burden for middle-class taxpayers, for example.  But the real
fundamental problem is that we're too stingy in what's truly important:
treating people as human beings made in God's image, not as animals
to be fed, caged and occasionally petted.
<p>
The real need is for leaders who are tough-minded, but also tenderhearted.
And willing to recognize the creation of people in God's image
and the need to treat people that way -- not just looking at it
through green eyeshades as a budgetary matter.  There are some
conservatives who've realized that.  There are some who understand
that.  Newt Gingrich does.  He's getting terrible press these
days.  He's gotten hard press all year, but he understands this.
Bill Bennett understands this.  There are some senators -- Dan
Coats, John Ashcroft, Rick Santorum -- who understand this.  There
are some members of Congress, and some governors I've met in my
travels around the country this year: George Allen, Kirk Fordice,
Fife Symington, and John Engler.  I think they have a sense of
this, and it's starting to come out in the way they speak.  It's
starting to come out in the types of legislation that they may
be moving through their states.  The critical understanding here
is that private programs that are challenging, personal, and spiritual
can do a better job than these failed governmental programs and
that people who are really concerned with helping the poor and
protecting children should not be doing any more to defend this
failed status quo.
<p>
Until that becomes the common understanding and message, until
liberals are ready to move away from the status quo, until conservatives
are ready to understand that it's not primarily a budgetary matter
-- that it's a matter of dreams and not just dollars -- then poor
people will stay on the welfare plantation and folks who want
to misuse the word &quot;compassion&quot; to derive political
capital will still get away with it.  At this point, it's hard
to say what's going to happen with this year's welfare bill. 
It may go down.  It's hard to predict from one moment to the next
what President Clinton will do.  I'm not sure he himself knows.
And so there's a lot of bad news these days.  But when you get
around the country, outside Washington, there's absolutely no
reason to be in social or political despair.  Why?  Because both
history and the present-day efforts represented by many people
here in this room show us the alternative to either softheadedness
or hardheartedness.  And that's what I want to emphasize right
now: the positive alternatives.  There is a way that good things
can come out of this year's effort, despite the failure of both
political parties to approach the question adequately.
<p>
<center><h3>UNDERSTANDING HISTORY</h3></center>
<p>
Let me just mention quickly the history.  After all, the reason
I'm speaking to you today is because I spent a year in the bowels
of the Library of Congress searching through old records.  I became
a witness to what the predecessors of many folks here in this
room, striving so diligently, accomplished.  I can testify to
all these folks whom the standard history books have forgotten.
And if you had history courses in high school or college, I suspect
that you've never heard of some of these people whom I'll refer
to today.  And there are lots more who are great heroes of faith
in practice.
<p>
Men like Charles Brace.  Here's a guy who over a 40-year period,
from 1850 to 1890, built lodging homes in New York City that provided
shelter to several hundred thousand abandoned children.  Over
the years, he placed 91,000 children in adoptive homes.  This
was his life.  This was his career.  This was his calling, and
he performed it wonderfully.
<p>
Women like Helen Mercy Woods.  From 1881 to 1903, she ran a shelter
in Chicago for pregnant and unmarried women.  Month after month
she gave personal attention to each newcomer.  She rejoiced as
their babies were born.  She helped some of her charges get married,
others to place their children for adoption, some to get jobs.
She kept at it year after year, as many people in this room have
kept at it year after year.
<p>
I can testify about some other forgotten heroes and heroines.
Annie Richardson Kennedy.  She ran a home for unwed moms in New
York City between 1900 and 1920.  Her goal was, first, to bring
the girls in touch with their Savior and then to build character.
She provided love and opportunity for thousands, and then she
disappeared into the fog of history.  My wife doesn't mind when
I fall in love with women like Helen Mercy Woods or Annie Richardson
Kennedy.  They've all been dead for a long time.  The text books
are silent.  They've been forgotten, and I want to testify to
the contributions they made.
<p>
They're part of a larger story that none of us learned about in
high school or college.  During the 19th century, before the federal
government ever got involved, there was a war on poverty that
was far, far more successful than our own -- especially considering
the degree of difficulty they had, considering that America was
a much poorer nation a hundred years ago than it is today.  It
was a war waged by tens of thousands of local, private charitable
agencies and religious groups around the country.  It was successful,
not because they abolished poverty, but because they witnessed
movement out of poverty by millions of people.  It was successful
because there were springs of fresh water flowing among the poor,
not just blocks of ice sitting in a perpetual winter of multi-generational
welfare dependency, always winter and never Christmas.  It was
successful because the optimism that was prevalent then contrasts
so sharply with the demoralization among the poor and the cynicism
among the better off that's so common now.  I can testify that
there was a great cloud of witnesses to effective poverty-fighting.
They succeeded in large ways by knowing and doing small but vital
things.
<p>
They knew first of all that the literal meaning of &quot;compassion&quot;
is not just writing a check, but having personal involvement with
the needy -- &quot;suffering with them.&quot;  That's what &quot;compassion&quot;
means: suffering with people, not just giving to them.  The poverty-fighters
of old knew that welfare doesn't mean passing a bill, but helping
a person to fare well.  These are some simple, elementary things
that our legislators seem to have forgotten.  The older generation
knew that people should be challenged.  When an able-bodied man
came to a homeless shelter, for example, he often was asked to
chop wood for an hour or two.  Or maybe whitewash the wall of
a building.  That way he could provide part of his own support
and also help those unable to chop.  They knew.  They demonstrated
through those work tests that even the most run-down person is
not just a taker.  He can also be a giver.  They knew that everyone
is made in God's image and is capable of helping.  Why have so
many people forgotten that?  Well, we don't know much about history.
<p>
History has taught us what to avoid.  Those poverty-fighters warned
us.  I'll give you just a few of their warnings, amazingly prophetic.
Mary Richmond, one of my heroines from the Baltimore Charity
Organizing Society in 1897:  &quot;Relief given without reference
to friends and neighbors is accompanied by moral loss.  Poor neighborhoods
are doomed to grow poorer whenever the natural ties of neighborliness
are weakened by well-meant but unintelligent interference.&quot;
<p>
Carl Herrick is here from the Daylight Foundation in Louisiana,
trying to get some good stuff going there.  Well, the New Orleans
Charity Organization Society in 1899 wisely noted that  &quot;intelligent
giving and intelligent withholding are alike to charity.  Giving
money to a poor person by itself is morally neutral.  The action
can hurt if not done wisely.  If done well with discernment, it's
the best thing in the world.  If done poorly, you're only helping
a person continue on the path of destruction.&quot;
<p>
And New York charity leader Josephine Lowell:  &quot;The problem
before those who'd be charitable is not how to deal with the given
number of the poor.  It's how to help those who are poor without
adding to their numbers and constantly increasing the evils they
seek to cure.&quot;
<p>
They were very forceful.  I'll give you one more quotation here:
&quot;It's important to reform those mild, well-meaning, tenderhearted,
sweet-voiced criminals who insist upon indulging in indiscriminate
charity.&quot;  Well, they were prophetic.  But we don't know
much about history.  We've forgotten America's past successes
in poverty-fighting, and the result has been the waste of not
just billions of dollars each year but the death of part of the
American dream.
<p>
<center><h3>THE CHALLENGE OF REAL COMPASSION</h3></center>
<p>
Now let me take a moment to mention this.  This is something that
some members of the Congress, I think, understand very well. 
But others need to just drop the green eye-shades and get into
real people, real lives, real dreams, and not just the dollars.
The critical part, the essential problem of the welfare system
now, is that sometimes it succeeds in keeping people fed.  But
it kills dreams.
<p>
It kills the helping dream of many Americans.  You know, most
of you, that millions of other people would like to be generous
at the entrance to the Metro here in Washington or at street corners
in your own towns.  But if you know, and there have been studies
showing this, that most homeless recipients will use any available
funds for drugs or alcohol, the tendency is to end up walking
by, avoiding eye contact.  And there's a subtle hardening that
occurs once more.
<p>
Welfare also kills the dreams of social workers.  A lot of conservatives
sometimes talk as if social workers are our enemies.  Not so at
all.  For the most part, these are extraordinarily well-intentioned
people.  The common lament they have is, &quot;All we have time
to do is move paper.&quot;  Here's a comment from a young social
worker who had the calling, who worked at it for a couple of years
and then just couldn't do it anymore.  He said, &quot;I had a
calling.  It was that simple.  I wanted to help.&quot;  And then
he resigned.  Frustrated and worn down, burned out, realizing
that he just wasn't doing any good.
<p>
And then there are some conservatives who talk as if the enemy
is poor individuals themselves.  Again, for the most part, not
so at all.  Welfare kills dreams among poor individuals who gradually
become used to dependency.  The worst thing for children is the
fatalism that often sets in.  And we've seen this, and there are
studies that show, that after a generation or especially two generations
of welfare there is a sense of, &quot;Whatever I do, it's not
going to do any good.  My mom was this way.  I'm going to be this
way.  Probably my children are going to be this way.&quot;  It
just goes on and on and on.  A fatalism.
<p>
Children need challenge.  Kids need a sense of opportunity.  They
don't get that in the welfare system.  And, in fact, they see
that adults who sacrifice leisure time and work hard to remain
independent are often called chumps rather than champs.  It kills
the dreams among children who grow up without fathers.  Those
of you who've coached a Little League team know this.  If there
were kids without fathers there, you knew.  You can tell who's
in that situation.  They alternately cling and show standoffishness
in a way that kids with functioning dads don't.  And it breaks
your heart.  So welfare kills.
<p>
A couple of weeks ago, I spent some time in south central Los
Angeles talking with some welfare moms there who told me about
-- here's an expression I didn't  know before -- 
&quot;county-check-pillow-pimps.&quot;
That's the expression they use.  Guys who come in on the last
day of the month.  They're called &quot;county checks&quot; because
in California you get the welfare check through the county.  Guys
come in on the last day of the month, they spend the night, they
get part of the welfare check that comes from the county the next
day.  So welfare has deprived kids of fathers, and it has deprived
women of husbands.  And I'm not saying that welfare is the cause,
but it certainly is an enabler.  Instead of helping to ennoble
people in poverty, helping them to fight, welfare tells people
to give in.  It enables them to stay in it.  And it kills.
<p>
Welfare packs a theological as well as a cultural punch.  After
all, how do children understand the nature of God the Father?
How do wives understand that Christ is the good husband for His
bride, the church, when they have no experience?  They've had
no experience at all with good fathers or good husbands, and they
don't know anyone who has in their whole block.
<p>
So Washington conservatives need to spend more time with folks,
poor people who are striving to get out of welfare.  If more people
actually walked the mean streets a little bit, they'd come to
understand this crucial point.  The reason to fight these governmental
welfare programs is not because they're too expensive, but because
they're inevitably too stingy in what is truly important: treating
people as human beings made in God's image, not as animals.
<p>
<center><h3>RECOVERING THE LOST TOOLS OF CHARITY</h3></center>
<p>
But again, no reason to despair.  There is good news around the
country.  Folks here in this room who are doing it know it.  We
are recovering the lost tools of charitable success.  We're seeing
a new great cloud of witnesses emerge.  We're living in an era
with many heroes, or, I should say, ordinary people who become
heroic as they show through hard &quot;suffering-with&quot; that
the American dream of compassion is not dead.  I don't know whether
John Perkins was heroic 30 years ago.  I've read his autobiography,
and I guess that he was heroic.  But he has grown in stature,
I suspect, over these years.  He has grown in grace and the knowledge
of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.  You continue to grow and
develop.
<p>
There are other people I've met who, when they started out in
their ministries, were really folks you would not consider to
be charismatic individuals at all.  They've become so over the
years.  They've learned.  They've grown.  One example.  A friend
of mine now, Bob Cote in Denver.  He's a tall, white ex-boxer.
He spent a year on the streets as an alcoholic in the early '80s.
Then he pulled together a few of his fellow winos and junkies
to start a homeless shelter, a program in Denver that's known
as Step 13.  Bob showed me around his four-story building -- he'd
be glad to give you a tour if you're in Denver sometime.  He showed
me how mostly dead people from off the streets can step-by-step
come back to life.  They can get jobs with increasing responsibility.
They can get rooms within that building that gradually reflect
greater independence.  They go from a big dormitory, to kind of
an alcove, to separate rooms with a lock on the door.  And they're
buying their own furniture and getting their own phone accounts,
and they're ready to step out and lead independent, responsible
lives.  It's a tough, time-intensive process, but Bob Cote has
been there himself.  He's there to help others.
<p>
A person right here in Washington, Hannah Hawkins, who lives down
in Anacostia.  A great person to visit.  She's short, black and
retired, but she voluntarily runs an after-school program that
has several dozen children doing their homework, receiving the
love they often don't get at home.  You go down there and sometimes
it's wild.  Sometimes those kids run around like lost sheep, but
she knows each one of her lambs by name.  It's challenging, it's
personal, it's spiritual.
<p>
I wish you'd come with me and visit Freddy Garcia in San Antonio.
He's a softhearted but hardheaded Hispanic ex-addict.  He formed
Victory Outreach some 30 years ago in San Antonio to help substance
abusers.  Groups based on his teaching now have spread throughout
Texas to California, even as far south as Peru.  I've sat in his
home this year.  I've watched the way he patiently counsels and
teaches those whom everyone else has abandoned.
<p>
This has been a good year for me, with all the travel and hubbub
and so forth.  I've really been blessed to see and come to know
some of these people.  And I'm here to testify that they succeeded,
and they're still succeeding and others can too.  They have the
common understanding.  They picked it up somewhere, somehow, that
in order to be effective, compassion must be challenging, personal
and spiritual.  CPS for short.  Just like CPR can bring back to
life a dying person, CPS can bring back to life that dying American
dream.
<p>
Again, if you're not familiar with some of these places, go and
visit.  Go down about a mile away to Clean and Sober Streets here
in Washington or the Gospel Mission with Reverend Woods.  At Clean
and Sober Streets, it's interesting that there are really tough
rules just as there are at the Gospel Mission.  One strike, you're
out.  There is compassion that is challenging, personal, and spiritual
at the Right Alternative Center in Milwaukee.  This is something
that Bill Schambra from the Bradley Foundation knows about well,
and has helped quite a bit.  People sometimes say that AFDC moms
will be stuck on the government rolls for a lifetime.  You go
there and you talk with the folks, and you will learn that the
moms there take a 13-part pledge.  They pledge to change their
own behavior.  Not to swear, not to shack up, not to do drugs.
And the leaders there challenge them to stick to their pledges.
And when they do, their lives change.  Some of them get married,
some of them get jobs, they run their households better, their
kids start doing better in school, the kids break out of their
fatalism.  That's the key enemy: not poverty, but fatalism.
<p>
There's compassion of that sort at the Union Gospel Mission in
Portland, the Disabled Businesspersons Association in San Diego,
and the Resources, Inc. program in Brooklyn -- the Samaritan Award
winners who are here today.  I've read their reports.  Challenging,
personal, spiritual.  Not easy.  Not easy at all, but possible.
<p>
I have personally seen some successes over the years.  I've seen
lives of pregnant, unmarried women turned around.  I've seen abandoned
children happily adopted.  I've seen failures.  Recently, I was
working with a homeless ex-con.  I thought that he was making
good progress, but now he has slipped back into irresponsibility.
He's in jail right now.  He's having a hearing next week.  Maybe
he'll get out and have another start.  I sent him over to the
most challenging shelter in Austin, Texas the same day I sent
my oldest son to college.  But my homeless friend, Fred, just
lasted three days at the shelter, and then he went back out on
the streets and is now in jail.  My son is still at the University
of Texas.
<p>
So, it's not easy, but it is possible.  People do change.  God
changed me.  He moved me out of the Marxism that I adhered to
25 years ago.  He brought me to a knowledge of Christ, and I'm
thankful to Him.  Other people can change.  You see it all the
time, and there's lots of experience in the room testifying to
that as well.
<p>
<center><h3>TOWARD A THEOLOGY OF CHARITY</h3></center>
<p>
But in order to really have confidence that this change can occur,
we have to do a couple of things.  And they're not primarily political.
The first thing we have to do is just awaken ourselves theologically
and put God's principles to work.  Only after that do we have
to start working on some public policy matters.
<p>
There is a lot of false gospel that's being offered now.  There
are those on the religious left who say that the Bible mandates
the government transfers of resources to the poor on the grounds
of, for example, Jesus' statement, &quot;Whatever you did to the
least of these, brethren, you did to Me.&quot;  Now I take that
verse very seriously.  But before we blindly use it to justify
the welfare state, we need to ask who are the least of these in
America?  What kind of help is real help?  Certainly, children
threatened with death before birth by abortion are among the least
of these, and I would love for all of the groups on the Christian
left that have been proclaiming so vociferously their love for
the unwanted, the poor, and the neglected to really work hard
on abortion.  Women abandoned by their husbands, children who
grow up without fathers.  They also have it very rough and the
concern should be: How do you give them hope?  How do you break
out of that fatalism?
<p>
But what about able-bodied homeless men?  One of the prime changes
in the welfare legislation that is chugging through Congress,
shortly to hit President Clinton's desk, is a cut (actually a
real cut) in aid to homeless men who are addicts or alcoholics.
Here's a hard case.  Here's something that I think obviously
should be changed.  Does irresponsibility qualify a person for
the ranks of the least of these?  Jesus does not include in his
list of commended charitable acts, &quot;When I was strung out,
you gave me dope.&quot;  If we take seriously Christ's words in
Matthew 25, &quot;Whatever you did to the least of these, my brethren,
you did to Me,&quot; then giving money that goes for drugs is
akin to sticking heroin into Jesus' veins.  So rather than proclaiming
the dire effect of cuts generally -- instead of rushing into the
guns at Cold Harbor -- why not accurately and carefully look at
some of these measures and say, &quot;Aha, this is something that
really should be cut&quot;?  Instead, we're not really getting
to that level of specific detail.  Instead, we're just hearing
the blanket condemnations of any movement away from the status
quo as if anything at all, any change at all, is an indication
of hardheartedness.
<p>
Well, if we straighten out the theology, the practice follows.
When I was a Marxist, I believed in top-down approaches, emphasizing
government redistribution.  But as a Christian, I understand that
change comes one by one from the inside out.  Straighten out the
theology of those who are rich, and there will be a tremendous
expansion of effective compassion.  Straighten out the theology
of those who are economically poor because of poor values, and
their attitudes and behaviors will change.  And they will make
progress.  So the essence here is revival and reformation among
both rich and poor.  That will transform American poverty-fighting.
There would be such an outpouring of private charity, if we had
that revival and reformation, that governmental programs could
rapidly be replaced.  We would not even have to debate the question
of tax credits for charitable contributions.
<p>
<center><h3>PUBLIC POLICY, POVERTY, AND THE PREAMBLE</h3></center>
<p>
But while we can hope and pray for revival and reformation, it's
not something that we can count on.  And so here we do come to
questions of public policy.  I'd suggest that a firm distinction
that needs to be made is the constitutional distinction between
&quot;providing&quot; and &quot;promoting.&quot;  The Constitution
talks about &quot;providing&quot; for the common defense, but
&quot;promoting&quot; the general welfare.  There's such a huge
difference between, say, renting a hall for a convention and manning
every booth in that hall yourself.  That's the difference between
providing and promoting.  We're in the mess we're in right now
because the government has attempted to provide welfare, and instead
it has given us entitlements and bureaucracy.  There's a legitimate
role for government, promoting the general welfare, but not providing.
<p>
That's where we come to this question of tax credits on either
a state or national level.  Frankly, I'd rather see it done on
a state-by-state level because we don't know exactly what the
best tax credit mechanism is.  The best way will promote discerning
giving on the part of individuals while avoiding government entanglement
with religious and other charities as much as possible.  We don't
know whether a hundred percent tax credit is absolutely the best
thing, or whether a 90 percent tax credit would generate just
about the same amount of income for private and church charities.
But a 90 percent tax credit would encourage considerably more
discernment on the part of givers because they'd be putting up,
let's say, a hundred dollars of their own money on a thousand
dollar contribution.  They might think a little more seriously
about where it's going.
<p>
I'm also worried about credits without any personal involvement.
It would be much better if we could offer tax credits only to
the individuals who also spend some time at the charities to which
they are giving.  The bookkeeping in that may be too complicated.
It may not work.  But I'd actually prefer to see things go on
a state-by-state basis so we would have some experiments.  Tax
credits, I think, are a very good idea.  And the constitutional
questions of interference with religious groups can be resolved.
If you have a coalition strong enough to pass tax credits, you
have a coalition strong enough to protect religious groups from
federal interference.
<p>
There is no reason, in fact, why you can't have a national approach
and state approaches at the same time, trying out different things
over these next few years to see what will best promote community-based,
poverty-fighting charities.  What I don't understand is why some
of the big philanthropic and charitable groups are not getting
on the team for tax measures to encourage giving.  You'd think
that they would be eager for such a reform, or else they're just
in the position of saying &quot;no, no, no&quot; to any change,
more and more vehemently.  I'd challenge those big charities like
Catholic Charities, but others also.  Why don't they propose something
positive instead of defending to the death a failed status quo?
If their concern is adequate funding for poverty programs, why
not tax credits?  Or else you have to start raising the question:
Are they more concerned about the poor, or about holding on to
their own power?  I'm not sure.  Everyone I've met from those
organizations is well-intentioned, but they've grown so used to
kissing up to government officials instead of going to individual
taxpayers and making the case to them that they deserve support.
Well, I don't know, but it's a problem.  It's a sad state of
affairs.
<p>
There are people who say, well, any other alternative just simply
will not work.  I was reading the other day about the case of
a student of management named Fred Smith, who went on to found
Federal Express.  And he described, in a term paper, his idea
for a reliable overnight delivery service.  His professor gave
him a &quot;C&quot; and explained that the concept was interesting
and well-formed.  &quot;But in order to earn better than a 'C,'&quot;
he said, &quot;the idea must be feasible.&quot;  Charity tax credit
proposals are feasible.  We need to experiment a little bit, but
we need to fight for them.  And we need to push the big philanthropies
and the big philanthropic trade organizations like Independent
Sector and the Council on Foundations to support them also.
<p>
This public policy stuff is important, but the tendency -- especially
here in Washington -- is to fall into the trap of thinking that
a particular piece of legislation is the solution.  Charity tax
credits are a great mechanism to take money off the top of the
governmental superstructure and stick it back on the bottom in
private and religious charities where it can do the most good.
But it's still just a mechanism.  The more time I spend in Washington,
the more I feel as if I'm reading from a manual for medical emergencies
put together by people whose goals exceed their wisdom.  This
is like a recommendation from a student in a junior high school
science class for a nose bleed: Put the nose much lower than the
body until the heart stops.
<p>
The public policy change is essential, but we can't wait for that.
Again, I am somewhat aghast at the thought of mentioning this
to some of you who have done so much over the years.  You know
the answer to this question very well because you've lived it.
But the question is: How does each of us individually help children
and adults now one by one?  How do we create models for the way
the entire welfare system can be transformed and replaced?  What
first steps can those of us in this room take?
<p>
<center><h3>TAKING FIRST STEPS</h3></center>
<p>
Especially in this group, I'm nervous about mentioning any of
the things that my wife and I have been involved in, but they've
been educational for us.  And again, as a number of you who know
me know, I am not always the most diplomatic person around.  Frederica
Mathewes-Green knows.  She is one of our national correspondents
at <I>World</I> magazine, and so she and I discuss editorial matters
and stories occasionally.  I want to be kind of a hard-nosed editor
at times, and so I tend not to be the nicest guy around.  My wife
is a much better person than I am in that regard.  But I tend
to think, okay, as bullheaded as I am, I have been able with my
wife to give a room in our home to needy individuals, to coach
kids in baseball, to tutor children, to mentor some folks, and
to adopt a child.  If I -- not a particularly hospitable individual,
a guy who would rather spend time in the bowels of the Library
of Congress than actually helping someone directly -- if I once
and awhile can do something a little bit decent, why can't people
with much greater merits, with much greater abilities and niceness
and goodness, do the same or even much more?
<p>
I know that many of you already give of yourselves a lot.  Can
you do even more?  Again, some of you I know are just working
already to the max.  Some of you have not probably been involved
with the poor at all.  Will you take a first step?  Just think
for a moment.  If I were a liberal, I would want you to close
your eyes and visualize world peace.  As it is, I want you to
visualize in your mind's eye one poor person whom you have directly,
personally helped during the past year.  A lot of you, I'm sure,
can do that and can probably visualize lots and lots of people.
If you don't see anyone, I pray that you'll take a small step
during 1996, and maybe then even a larger one: tutoring a child
for one hour a week, being a big brother or big sister, or Little
League coach, mentoring an adult who's gotten in trouble, providing
Biblical counsel to a young, unmarried pregnant woman, maybe giving
her a room in your home, maybe adopting a child.  Those steps
are hard, but we're surrounded.  We are just so surrounded by
a great cloud of witnesses, men and women like ourselves who have
taken first steps and then many more.  This is what I have learned
by going around the country this year.
<p>
Remember chapters 11 and 12 of Hebrews talking about the great
cloud of witnesses?  Hebrews 12:1 says, &quot;Therefore, since
we are surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside
every weight.  Let us run with patience the race that is set before
us.&quot;  Let's work theologically, let's work politically, let's
work personally.  As we work and pray, let's remember that 2,000
years ago Jesus Christ came into the world to suffer with us,
to die for us, and in this year of our Lord 1995 it is such a
great blessing to see godly people who follow in His steps.
<p>
It was six years ago, just before Christmas 1989, that I began
trying in my own real small way to resurrect the word &quot;compassion&quot;
among conservatives and to promote some compassionate alternatives
to failed welfare programs.  I gave a talk six years ago at the
Heritage Foundation, and I just ran across a copy in my files
a couple of days ago while thinking about what I would say here
today.  I gave it at the time when I was in the middle of my historical
research at the Library of Congress.  But it still seems relevant
to me, and I haven't talked about this for a long time.  Let me
just read the ending of that talk:
<p>
<blockquote><i>It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.  A time when 
God came to earth to teach, to suffer, and to save by suffering. 
A generation ago, Whittaker Chambers wrote that 'suffering is
at the heart of every living faith.  That is why a man can scarcely
call himself a Christian for whom the crucifixion is not a daily
suffering.'  Chambers knew that Christianity is rooted in suffering.
I would add 'suffering with.'  But he recognized that the meaning
of the faith 'has been blurred as Christianity, in common with
the voices of a new age, seeks new escapes from the problem of
suffering.  Nothing is more characteristic of this age than its
obsession with an avoidance of suffering.'  Are we in America,
and conservatives especially, serious people?  Frankly, I do not
always know whether I am.  I do not know whether you are.  I hope
we are.  I pray that we are, but I do not know.  I do not know,
but finding out is the challenge of the 1990s for the conservative
movement.</i></blockquote>
<p>
That was what I was saying in 1989.  Now it's 1995, and we've
made some progress.  The battle for the word &quot;compassion,&quot;
the understanding of compassion, is now on.  But the body count
is growing.  Those bodies that are Cold Harbors all over the inner
cities of this country are just piling up.  And the defenders
of this status quo are tenacious.  At least we're in the fight.
It's hard, but it's glorious.  I've been glad to be fighting
alongside a lot of you this year.  And I pray that that will continue
and that we will overcome with God's grace.
<p>
Thank you very much.

<title>HEARING ON RELIGIOUS LIBERTY</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">
<h2>HEARING ON RELIGIOUS LIBERTY</h2>
<h4>Testimony of Cathleen A. Cleaver, Esq.<br>
Director of Legal Studies, Family Research Council<br>
before the<br>
Committee on the Judiciary<br>
of the<br>
United States Senate<br>
October 25, 1995</h4></center>
<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, I am the Director of
Legal Studies for the Family Research Council, a non-profit research
and advocacy organization, established to defend family, faith,
and freedom.  On behalf of Gary Bauer and the Family Research
Council, I want to express our sincere appreciation for the opportunity
to address this distinguished Committee on the critical issue
of religious liberty.
<p>
The First Amendment is not internally inconsistent.  The Establishment
Clause[1] was designed to prevent the State from coercing a religious
belief. The Free Exercise Clause[2] was designed to prevent the
State from interfering with the exercise of religious beliefs.
Thus, the religion clauses were designed to work hand-in-hand
to promote government neutrality with regard to religion.
<p>
In the last several decades, however, the Supreme Court has wrongly
interpreted the clauses to be antagonistic to each other.  The
Court has created a false conflict between the religion clauses
which must be reconciled in each case, and the Establishment Clause
prohibition has been the usual victor.  &quot;The government cannot
avoid aiding religion unless it actively opposes religion,&quot;
the argument goes.  More often than not, discrimination against
citizens or groups with religious viewpoints has become the only
constitutionally &quot;safe&quot; resolution to this false conflict.
Insistence on avoiding appearances of endorsement of or incidental
aid to religion has worked to inhibit the free exercise of religion.
Complementary clauses read to be inconsistent could not but 
result in inconsistent rulings.  The current &quot;chaos&quot;
in the federal courts in this area, therefore, is distressing,
but not surprising.
<p>
On October 20th, this Committee heard testimony from a distinguished
panel of experts who discussed the history of interpretation errors
in First Amendment religion clause jurisprudence, and efforts
to correct those errors by various federal statutes.  I will not
repeat this testimony, nor will I refute the argument that nothing
need be done, for the acceptability of that position is increasingly
waning.[3]
<p>
I will, instead, attempt to explain our preference for a constitutional
amendment rather than a federal statute, and address specific
concerns which have been raised in the public debate. 
<p>
The Family Research Council supports an amendment to the constitution
clarifying the First Amendment's prohibition of discrimination
against religious expression, and against persons, groups, or
organizations in access to government benefits or protections
on account of the religious character of their speech or identity.
We do not favor changing the First Amendment in any way.  Rather,
we support an amendment which would correct the Supreme Court's
misinterpretation of the First Amendment.
<p>
Several concerns and questions have been raised about the amendment
approach and its ramifications.
<p>
<B>1. Is such a radical approach really necessary?</B>  First,
it is wise to keep from confusing <I>procedure</I> with <I>substance.</I>
Amending the constitution is a radical procedure, to be sure.
Article V of the Constitution ensures that it is not to be achieved
without effort and consensus.  Yet, the substance of a restorative
religious liberty amendment need not be radical in nature.  Legal
experts and numerous interested groups have examined potential
approaches for months, and the Family Research Council remains
willing to continue to discuss specific language for the amendment.
We are especially eager to hear your specific ideas, Mr. Chairman,
and those of Congressman Hyde. For purposes of discussion this
morning, I will center my comments on the draft proposal garnering
considerable support, and presented to this Committee at the October
20th hearing:[4]
<p><blockquote>
<b>In order to secure the unalienable right of the people to
acknowledge, worship, and serve their Creator, neither the United
States nor any State shall deny benefits to or otherwise discriminate
against any persons, acting in a private capacity, on account
of their religious expression, belief, or identity; and the exercise
by such persons of freedom of religion, speech, press, or association
shall not be construed as an establishment of religion.</b>
</blockquote><p>
This language would, in effect, say to government, &quot;do not
discriminate against persons on account of their religious beliefs,&quot;
and to the Supreme Court, &quot;do not construe this non-discriminatory
treatment to be a governmental establishment of religion.&quot;
The fact that some civil liberties groups call the Amendment
extreme does not make it so.  It is a negative mandate upon government:
do not discriminate and do not misconstrue.  It bestows no new
rights, it apportions no new responsibilities.  Far from &quot;injecting
the federal government into the situation&quot; as some critics
perceive, the Religious Liberty Amendment  protects religious
liberty by ensuring government neutrality toward religion.  The
Amendment is not radical in substance.  Indeed, it is nothing
more than an embodiment of First Amendment principles properly
understood.
<p>
<B>2.  If it is not radical, why is it necessary?</B>  It is necessary
to correct serious misinterpretations of a Constitution provision.
 It is restorative, not creative.  The amendment process is an
appropriate means of clarifying the Constitution of the People.
Several constitutional amendments have been in the nature of clarifications,
especially the voting rights amendments.
<p>
<B>3.  Some suggest that the Court is coming around on its own,
obviating the need for an amendment</B>. <i>Rosenberger v. University
of Virginia</i> is generally cited here.[5] <i>Rosenberger</i>,
however, like other 5-4 decisions with multiple opinions, is a
very fact-dependent decision.  In reversing the University of
Virginia's decision to withhold student activity funds for a Christian
student magazine, Justice Kennedy found it important that Wide
Awake Productions, the publisher, was not a &quot;religious organization&quot;
and that the funds would go to a printing company rather than
directly to the student publication.[6] Moreover, Justice O'Connor
warned in her concurrence that <i>Rosenberger</i> is not meant
to establish any bright-line test.[7] Despite its disclaimers and
reservations, <i>Rosenberger</i> was a good result, yet there
is simply no reason to conclude that <i>Rosenberger</i> signals
a new consistency in religion clause jurisprudence.  Indeed, Justice
Souter in his dissent went so far as to say that neutrality toward
religion is not required by the First Amendment.  It could be
years before another religious discrimination case of this kind
is taken up by the high court.  In the meantime, some Americans'
precious First Amendment rights are held in abeyance, the deprivation
of which is an irreparable harm.
<p>
<B>4.  Will a Religious Liberty Amendment prevent any future misconstruction
of the Religion Clauses?</B>  No.  And it is, of course,  possible
that the Amendment itself will be misconstrued.  Any assertion
to the contrary would be disingenuous.  But to concede these points
does not then force a concession that the Amendment will be futile
or meaningless.  The Supreme Court made a wrong turn in 1947 in
<i>Everson v. Board of Education</i>;[8] momentum and the weighty principle of 
<I>stare decisis</I>[9] have worked against the Court's righting itself.
Even considering the possibility of misinterpretation, an amendment
would dislodge the Court from its faulty construction of internal
inconsistency in the First Amendment.
<p>
<B>5. Will the Amendment create a new entitlement program for
church-related programs or schools?</B>  No. Government has no
obligation to provide funds to private schools, for example. 
Yet, if government should decide to do so, a Religious Liberty
Amendment would prevent the government from discriminating in
favor of private secular schools and against private parochial
schools.[10] The Amendment would <I>permit</I> government to fund
secular classes in religious schools, but would not <I>require</I>
government to fund such classes.   Religious activities would
not be funded by the government -- the Amendment would not eradicate
the Establishment Clause, after all -- but activities conducted
in religious settings or by religious people could be funded,
if such activities were within the purview of the secular government
funding program.  The &quot;pervasively sectarian&quot; or &quot;pervasively
religious&quot; analysis would be abandoned.
<p>
<B>6. Would an Amendment allow teacher-led prayer?</B> No. 
The Amendment would ensure that persons in their private capacity
would be free from discrimination, but government employees, including
teachers, would be subject to the restrictions of the Establishment
Clause when acting in their official capacity, such as when teaching.
<p>
<B>7. Why not seek a statutory remedy?</B>  A federal statute
could ultimately be futile.  While such a statute would initially
resolve inconsistencies from state to state,[11] the Supreme Court
would remain the final arbiter of the Constitution.  A federal
statute would not prevent judges from continuing to misconstrue
the First Amendment.  While a statute might survive a facial challenge,
an &quot;as applied&quot; challenge would quite possibly be adjudged
unconstitutional under current precedent.  A statutory &quot;solution&quot;
would be a hollow victory, if, at the end of the day, the substantial
efforts to draft, enact, and defend a statute were swiftly abolished
by one Supreme Court opinion.  When the roof is leaking, repair
the roof -- don't buy more buckets.
<p>
The Religious Liberty Amendment could be thought of as the religious
&quot;neutrality&quot; amendment.  This principle of neutrality
is not new -- it is the aim and result of our First Amendment's
religion clauses properly understood.  A Religious Liberty Amendment
could restore this saving principle, so that our First Amendment
would not be used to promote the empty state religion of secularism, but to 
promote true freedom, and the prospect of freedom's fulfillment in truth, 
to which every American is entitled.

<h2><i>MEYER</i>, HOW YOU'VE GROWN:<br>
THE STRANGE TRANSFORMATION<br>
OF THE SUPREME COURT'S<br>
PRIVACY DOCTRINE</h2>

<p>
<i>This paper is the text of a lecture given at Molloy College, Rockville Center, 
NY, on April 21, 1994.</i>
<p>
The &quot;constitutional right of privacy&quot;
was much talked about back in 1987, when Robert Bork -- a nominee
who had been considered unbeatable because of his sterling legal
record -- was, in fact, beaten, largely because his opponents
focused on the fact that he had critiqued the Court's privacy
cases.  Judge Bork's defeat should have meant, at a minimum, that
privacy, whatever exactly it is, is highly valued by the American
people.
<p>
Supporters of Judge Bork countered that the word &quot;privacy&quot;
was merely that year's euphemism for abortion.  They were right,
insofar as the cases that Judge Bork had gotten in the most trouble
for critiquing were <i>Griswold v. Connecticut</i>,[1] in which the Court
struck down a statute that banned the use of contraceptives, and
<i>Roe v. Wade</i>,[2] which, of course, is the foundational case for a
constitutional right of abortion.
<p>
But the constitutional right
of privacy did not start with these cases.  It started in a very
different kind of cultural environment and was deployed in defense
of very different values.  The story of its origins and subsequent
development tells us a lot about the changes in the thinking of
our nation's elites between the early 1920's and today.
<p>
The privacy cases trace their origin to a series of Supreme Court cases in
the 1920's that all dealt, in one way or another, with the rights
of parents to direct the education of their children.  Included
in this series were <i>Meyer v. Nebraska</i>[3] and <i>Bartels v. Iowa</i>,[4] 
in which the Court struck down statutes that banned the teaching
of foreign languages below the ninth grade.
<p>
(You might wonder how such statutes got passed in the first place.  Remember that
this was in the early 20's, and passions were still high from
World War I.  Notice that the names of the
plaintiffs, Meyer and Bartels, were both German.)
<p>
In the later cases of the series, <i>Pierce v. Society of Sisters</i>[5] 
and <i>Farrington v. Tokushige</i>,[6] the Court struck down statutes that were 
aimed at eliminating private education.  The statute struck down in <i>Pierce</i>
had banned private schools outright by mandating children's attendance
at public schools.  The statute struck down in <i>Farrington</i> imposed
an extensive and intrusive regulatory regime on so-called &quot;foreign
language schools&quot; in Hawaii.  (It appears that this statute
was primarily an anti-Japanese move, since schools that used the
Hawaiian language were not considered &quot;foreign,&quot; while
Japanese was by far the leading minority language.)  Of these
four cases, two of them -- <i>Meyer</i> and <i>Pierce</i> -- came to be seen
as the leading ones, and the theory that sees the parent-child
relationship as protected by the Due Process Clause is sometimes
called the <i>Meyer-Pierce</i> doctrine.
<p>
In those days, the Supreme Court
was much in the habit of striking down social legislation and
economic regulation.  The Court was fervently committed to free
market economics and to the philosophy of individualism that goes
with such economics, and it frequently resorted to the argument
that the Constitution itself prohibits laws that regulate the
economic marketplace.  In some cases it used the Constitution's
Contracts Clause[7] of Article II Section 10 of the Constitution,
but it relied even more heavily on the Due Process Clause of the
14th Amendment, which prohibits states from taking life, liberty,
or property without due process of law.
<p>
Some jurists, including Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes,[8] offered the critique 
that was later offered by Robert Bork and others -- that the Due Process Clause
focuses on process rather than substance and does not give the
Court the power to strike down regulations enacted according to
fair procedures.  Holmes, in 1905, like Bork in 1987, stood up
for &quot;the right of a [political] majority to embody their
opinions in law.&quot;  But that other great majority -- a majority
of the Court -- held throughout the early 20th century that the
Due Process Clause protects more than mere due process; it also
prohibits some types of legislation altogether, and may, therefore,
be said to protect &quot;due substance&quot; as well as due process.
<p>
This doctrine, which came to be known as &quot;substantive due
process,&quot; is also the doctrinal matrix of the parents' rights
cases.  The conventional explanation today of the Court's solicitude
both for economic freedom and for parental authority is that the
Court was protecting a class system that depended both on patriarchal
authority and on unrestrained capitalism.[9]  But the need for &quot;hidden
agenda&quot; theories diminishes once one realizes that household
and marketplace are not antitheses, but different points along
a continuum of interconnected human relationships.  The very term
&quot;economics&quot; comes from the Greek &quot;oikos,&quot;
meaning &quot;household.&quot;  (Also underlying the Court's concern
was the right of private school teachers to earn their living
at their chosen profession.[10])
<p>
In the 30's, substantive due process
was a major obstacle to FDR's reforms.  Regardless of where one
stands on the merits of FDR's programs, one does have to recognize
that the electorate wanted change and was getting tired of unelected
and life-tenured judges using esoteric constitutional doctrines
to substitute their philosophy for the philosophy embraced by
the majority of the nation.   FDR's Attorney General, Robert Jackson,
spoke eloquently of how the Court had substituted its own views
of the Constitution for what the Constitution actually says. 
Eventually FDR put Jackson and other liberal jurists on the Court;
the doctrine of substantive due process officially went into discredit
in 1937; and a former clerk to Justice Jackson is now Chief Justice
of the United States.
<p>
Only one strand of substantive due process
survived 1937 -- the <i>Meyer-Pierce</i> doctrine.  It's true that the
Court placed an outer limit on that doctrine in 1944, in <i>Prince
v. Massachusetts</i>,[11] in which it held that <i>Meyer</i> and <i>Pierce</i> 
do not exempt parents or guardians from the child labor laws.  This case
involved a child's legal guardian who wanted the child to help
her distribute religious literature.  The Court turned aside both
a parents' rights claim and a free exercise of religion claim.
 To this day, <i>Prince</i> is always the first case cited by government
attorneys defending some state action against a constitutional
challenge by parents.  But even in <i>Prince</i>, the Court went out
of its way to clarify that it was not overruling the <i>Meyer-Pierce</i>
doctrine.  It said:
<p>
<blockquote>It is cardinal with us that the custody,
care and nurture of the child reside first in the parents, whose
primary function and freedom include preparation for obligations
the state can neither supply nor hinder.  <i>Pierce, supra</i>.  And
it is in recognition of this that these decisions have respected
the private realm of family life which the state cannot enter.
</blockquote><p>
In 1942, two years before <i>Prince</i>, the Court showed the enduring power
of the notion that the Constitution protects certain fundamental
relationships.  The case was <i>Skinner v. Oklahoma</i>,[12] and it struck
down a statute that authorized sterilization as a punishment for
a third conviction for certain crimes (a eugenics-era version
of &quot;three strikes and you're out&quot;).  The case was basically
resolved under the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment,
rather than the Due Process Clause, on the theory that Oklahoma
had made an irrational distinction in punishing some crimes by
sterilization while other, similar crimes were not subject to
such punishment.  But the driving force behind the ruling seems
to have been the Court's abhorrence of sterilization as a punishment,
and here the Court brought in the Due Process analysis familiar
from the <i>Meyer-Pierce</i> line of cases.
<p><blockquote>
We are dealing here with
legislation which involves one of the basic rights of man.  Marriage
and procreation are fundamental to the very existence and survival
of the race.[13]
</blockquote><p>
Notice that here, as in <i>Meyer</i> and <i>Pierce</i>, the Court
continues to see the protected right as inherently relational.
 It's &quot;marriage and procreation,&quot; neither of which are
solitary activities.  The Court is still protecting relationships,
rather than self-definition by isolated individuals.
<p>
Notice also that the Court has redefined the nature of the <i>Meyer-Pierce</i> 
holdings. It has given them a new lease on life in the post-1937 world
by ignoring their origins in economic substantive due process
and emphasizing instead their protection of the privacy of protected
relationships.
<p>
The next chapter in the development of the constitutional
privacy right was <i>Griswold v. Connecticut</i>[14] in 1965.  Here the Court
was faced with a very broad anti-contraceptive statute that it
very much wanted to strike down.  The problem was, how?  The Court
had long since rejected substantive due process, and, with it,
the notion that the Court is entitled to sit as a super-legislature,
striking down duly enacted statutes merely because it disagreed
with them.  Back in the 30's, liberals had thrown out the old
substantive due process that protected economic rights.  Would
the liberals of the 60's bring substantive due process back, so
as to protect privacy?
<p>
The answer was yes -- but they did it carefully.
 In a majority opinion by Justice Douglas, the Court in <i>Griswold</i>
reaffirmed the death of substantive due process and repudiated
the notion of legislating from the bench.[15]  It then looked for
constitution clauses other than the 14th Amendment Due Process
Clause for a way to strike down the statute.  What they came up
with was the theory that the 1st, 4th, and 5th Amendments all
protect privacy in some way;  plus, the 9th Amendment authorizes
judges to find new, non-textual rights;  so, on the whole, a general
right of privacy may be said to be one of the &quot;emanations&quot;
from &quot;penumbras&quot; of those amendments.[16]
<p>
The <i>Griswold</i> opinion has both a moderate face and a radical face.  Its moderate 
face is seen in the fact that the privacy right that it protected was
specifically a right of <i>marital</i> privacy.  The opinion contains
some glowing rhetoric about the importance and sacredness of the
marital relationship.[17] This rhetoric is fully consistent both
with the values of most Americans, and with the theory of relational
privacy as we have seen it in <i>Meyer</i> and <i>Pierce</i>, and both those
cases were among those cited in <i>Griswold</i>.[18]
<p>
The radical face of <i>Griswold</i> is seen in its headline value.  I have not 
looked up the original newspaper accounts of <i>Griswold</i>, but I feel reasonably 
confident that they did not say &quot;Court Affirms Privacy Doctrine,&quot;
or &quot;Court Embarks on New Substantive Due Process,&quot; or
&quot;Court Does Novel Analysis of 1st, 4th, 5th and 9th Amendments.&quot;
 No:  the real news value of <i>Griswold</i> lay in the fact that by
its effect, though not by its language, it elevated contraception
to the status of a constitutional right.  That elevation had profound
cultural impact.  Formerly, contraception was, no doubt, widely
practiced, but at the same time it lacked cultural cachet.  It
still carried connotations of the unrespectable, the bohemian.
<i>Griswold</i> had the effect of wrapping contraception in the red,
white, and blue; and, in so doing, it placed a certain judicial
seal of approval on the sexual revolution that was then in progress.
<p>
By 1972, the evidence suggested that this was precisely the direction
in which the Court intended to take the new substantive due process.
For instance, while <i>Griswold</i> seemed to create a due process right
to contraception only for married people, the Court in <i>Eisenstadt
v. Baird</i>[19] in 1972 used the Equal Protection Clause to extend the
same right to the unmarried.
<p>
It also completely contradicted the rhetoric in <i>Griswold</i> about marriage: 
whereas <i>Griswold</i> had cited the special, sacred nature of the marital 
relationship as a basis for finding a privacy right,[20] <i>Eisenstadt</i> heaped 
scorn on the notion that marriage is anything special, and affirmed instead
the continuing legal and metaphysical separateness of spouses.
<p>
Let's pause to retrace our steps.  We started in the 20's with <i>Meyer,
Bartels, Pierce</i>, and <i>Farrington</i>, which affirmed a right of privacy
for protected relationships, namely, those of the family.  They
made the family, especially in its role as bearer and rearer of
children, a zone of limited yet real legal autonomy.  We moved
on to <i>Skinner</i>, the sterilization case from 1942, where we saw
that the privacy doctrine had survived the death of substantive
due process and was still available to protect &quot;marriage
and procreation.&quot;  Then we saw <i>Griswold</i>, where procreation
drops out of the picture, and finally, <i>Eisenstadt</i>, where marriage
drops out of the picture.  The privacy right has by this point
become a constitutional right to reject the values that it was
originally designed to protect.
<p>
After <i>Eisenstadt</i>, the stage was set for <i>Roe v. Wade</i>.[21] 
Roe is probably the most analyzed case in legal history, and I'm certainly 
not going to break any new ground under it today.  In terms of the issues 
we're discussing today, there are two remarkable things about <i>Roe</i>.  One is 
that it dropped the pretense, maintained in <i>Griswold</i>, that the Court 
was doing something other than bringing back substantive due process, in
a new form and at the service of a different set of values.  Two,
it marked the final repudiation of the old relational approach
to privacy, where privacy protected relationships, and inaugurated
an era in which privacy stands for a sort of erotic hyper-individualism:
 an individual's right to define him- or herself, especially through
sexual activity, free from all binding commitments, and free from
all encumbrances other than those that the individual freely and
continuously chooses.
<p>
This is really the constitutionalization of the metaphysics of Jean-Paul Sartre 
and the Existentialists, who taught that the human person makes himself through 
his own choices.[22] It follows that choosing is more important than being,
and freedom is &quot;a constantly renewed obligation to remake
the <i>Self</i>....&quot;[23]
<p>
Although <i>Roe</i> contained a few hedges against this isolationist view of 
individualism -- where it says, for instance, that the woman &quot;cannot be 
isolated in her privacy&quot;[24] -- nonetheless, the later abortion cases 
entrenched isolationist individualism further into the Court's evolving 
concept of privacy. For instance, in <i>Planned Parenthood v. Danforth</i>[25] 
in 1975, the Court struck down a paternal consent requirement for abortion.
 The mutation of the privacy doctrine ought not to pass unnoticed.
 In <i>Meyer</i> and <i>Pierce</i>, it envisioned the parents, as a unit, 
exercising autonomy for the benefit of the child.  By the time we get to
<i>Danforth</i>, we find that it nullifies one parent's rights altogether,
and protects the other parent's autonomy at the expense of the
child.  Another way to look at the matter is that in the 20's,
the privacy right protected the family as such, while in the 70's,
it viewed family ties as one of the chief obstacles to privacy.
<p>
To be sure, the Court has not thrown itself four-square behind the
new view of privacy -- privacy as the individual's right, in isolation
from family and society, to define himself through an ongoing
process of choosing.  If it had, <i>Bowers v. Hardwick</i>[26] would have
come out the other way.  We know this because we have Justice
Blackmun's dissent in that case, which reads like a majority opinion,
which it very nearly was.
<p>
The dissenters in that case, not the majority, had a theory of human freedom, 
albeit one against which many objections could be raised.  The majority simply took 
the position that theories of freedom are one thing, constitutional
law is another, and nothing in the Constitution authorizes the
Court to act as the nation's official philosophy board.  That's
a very strong argument -- but, in a sense, much less interesting
than what the dissenters had to say.
<p>
The Blackmun dissent argued for a broad privacy doctrine while completely and 
explicitly rejecting the <i>Meyer-Pierce</i> view of privacy.  Wrote Justice 
Blackmun: &quot;We protect those rights [referring to marriage and family] not 
because they contribute, in some direct and material way, to the general
public welfare, but because they form so central a part of an
individual's life.&quot;[27]
<p>
For comparison, consider the key statement of the meaning of the privacy doctrine in 
<i>Pierce</i>. Justice McReynolds wrote for the Court:
<p>
<blockquote>The fundamental theory of liberty upon which
all governments in this Union repose excludes any general power
of the State to standardize its children by forcing them to accept
instruction from public teachers only.  The child is not the mere
creature of the State;  those who nurture him and direct his destiny
have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare
him for additional obligations.[28]
</blockquote><p>
The views of privacy endorsed by the Court in the 1920's, and those that it 
sometimes endorsed in the 1970's, are not absolutely contradictory, but they 
certainly pull in different directions.  Justice McReynolds could, theoretically,
have defended parents' rights in terms of the parents' individual
self-definitions, with their children being mere tools in the
parents' life projects.  Such a view would have been a perfect
fit with that of Blackmun in <i>Bowers</i>.   But instead, McReynolds
coupled parents' rights with parents' duties, and specifically
held that this package of rights and duties is oriented towards
preparing the child &quot;for additional obligations.&quot;  He
does not specify what those obligations are, but, from the very
fact that he views these terms as self-explanatory, we may infer
that he means the ordinary obligations of life in a democratic
republic:  being a good friend and neighbor, participating in
civic life, pulling one's own weight economically, taking care
of one's family, and so forth.[29]
<p>
For the mindset of the 1970's, on the other hand, all those obligations -- the 
claims of family, neighborhood, the political community, etc. -- are just so many
encumbrances on the free choice of the individual.  These two
human prototypes -- 1920's Man and 1970's Man, McReynolds Man
and Blackmun Man -- have barely enough in common even to speak
to each other.  From the point of view of 70's Man, 20's Man is
a bundle of complexes and prejudices who never has any fun.  From
the point of view of 20's Man, 70's Man is rootless and shallow,
a passive consumer of pleasurable sensations, not the sort of
person around whom any real community can be built.
<p>
It cannot be stressed too often, however, that constitutional law does not
necessarily force us to choose between 20's Man and 70's Man as
our preferred human type.  There is always the possibility that
the 14th Amendment does not incorporate either as its preferred
model for human society, but instead leaves that choice up to
the democratic process in the several states, cheerfully anticipating
that some states and localities will go in more of a 20's direction,
and others will go in more of a 70's direction.  This option is
the only one I know of that stands a chance of bringing peace
to our judicial politics.
<p>
As it happens, this option was also the
very one offered by Robert Bork.  Critical of the reasoning of
<i>Meyer</i> and <i>Pierce</i> no less than of that of Roe, his philosophy of
sticking narrowly to the constitutional text may have offered
the closest approximation to a truce in the wars over what kind
of privacy, what kind of human person, what kind of society is
envisioned in the 14th Amendment.  The story of his confirmation
battle is the story of how the partisans of 20's Man were willing
to accept this truce, but the partisans of 70's Man were not.
 The truce was rejected; the wars go on, judicially as well as
culturally.
<p>
Today it is simply a given, in the courts and in the
law reviews, that the Constitution protects privacy, <i>in some sense.</i>
 What sense precisely, future cases will have to tell.  The 90's
are not the 20's, but neither are they the 70's.

For one of many examples of pure substantive due process, <I>see</I> Coppage v. Kansas, 236 U.S. 1 (1915), in which the Court declared: &quot;[T]he Fourteenth Amendment, in declaring that a State shall not `deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law,' gives to each of these an equal sanction;  it recognized `liberty' and `property' as co-existent human rights, and debars the States from any unwarranted interference with either.&quot;  The problem with this glowing sentiment, of course, is that it works a huge transfer of power to whatever institution is empowered to determine which interferences are &quot;warranted&quot; and which are not  -- and that institution just happens to be the federal judiciary, and ultimately the Supreme Court.  In the early 20th century, American businessmen and lawyers were willing to effect this transfer.

<h2>RECLAIMING THE FAMILY:<br>
WHAT PETER UHLENBERG CAN TEACH US</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by<br>
William R. Mattox, Jr.</i></center>

<p>

<i>This speech was presented at the James Madison Institute's
&quot;Reclaiming America's Cultural and Moral Heritage&quot; conference
on April 20, 1996 in Clearwater, Fla.</i>

<p>

One of the first questions that nearly every public opinion pollster
in Washington asks survey respondents is, &quot;Do you think the
country is generally on the right track or on the wrong track?&quot;
Answers to this question typically offer a crude indication of
the public's mood at any given point in time and a useful measurement
for monitoring shifts in attitudes over time.

<p>

For many years, there was a strong correlation between people's
perceptions about the country's direction and the health of the
U.S. economy.  When the economy was up, people thought America
was on the right track.  When the economy was down, Americans
perceived that we were off course as a nation.  In fact, so closely
did these two measurements track together that if there were a
significant change-up or down-in the index of leading economic
indicators, pollsters could reliably predict that a corresponding
shift in the mood of the country would begin showing up about
six months later.  It was all very predictable.

<p>

But several years ago, something dramatic happened.  As America
began to pull out of the recession that hit in the early 1990s,
the public mood did not shift significantly.  It remained in the
doldrums.  While the country experienced improving economic conditions,
roughly two in three Americans continued to maintain that the
country was on the &quot;wrong track.&quot;  Understandably, this
caught many pollsters off guard.  They began to ask follow up
questions to see why so many Americans were pessimistic about
America's future.

<p>

What they found was quite interesting.  While some pessimists
cited downsizing or joblessness or other sorts of economic concerns,
most identified cultural concerns as the primary reason for their
pessimism.  Indeed, several recent polls have shown that as many
as four out of five Americans believe that it is significantly
tougher for a kid to grow up in America today than it was a generation
or two ago.

<p>

If we were to transport ourselves back in time, I suspect the
situation we now find ourselves in would surprise many Americans.
Imagine, for a moment, a scene from, say, 30 or 35 years ago.
A pollster knocks on the door of a young couple and says, &quot;Three
decades from now, there will be no more Soviet Union.  There will
be no more Berlin Wall.  There will be no more Cold War.  America
will be the world's only military superpower.  It will have a
Gross National Product at least three times its current size.
Given these conditions, do you believe America will be or will
not be on the right path?&quot;

<p>

I suspect many at that time would have answered affirmatively,
imagining that America had entered a glorious age.  Yet, if you
ask the American people today, they'll tell you something very
different.  They will tell you that while living standards may
be increasing in America, the quality of life is declining.  And
lest one attribute such downbeat conclusions to Americans' unrealistic
expectations, it bears mentioning that schoolchildren today do
not crawl under their desks to participate in some sort of a mock
nuclear attack drill -- in some schools, students crawl under
their desks to escape real bullets shot in one direction or another
by one of their peers.

<p>

In thinking about cultural decline and some of the problems that
have arisen in the last 35 years, I think there are at least three
lessons to be learned from the work of a sociologist at the University
of North Carolina named Peter Uhlenberg.   While I recognize that
his work may be unfamiliar to many of you, it should be noted
that long before Dan Quayle ever took on <I>Murphy Brown</I>,
or Bill Bennett ever introduced his <I>Index of Leading Cultural
Indicators</I>, or Hillary Clinton ever penned <I>It Takes a Village
to Raise a Child</I>, Peter Uhlenberg was addressing many of the
questions we are wrestling with today in the public arena.

<p>

Indeed, 10 years ago in 1986, Uhlenberg and one of his colleagues
wrote an essay that appeared in Irving Kristol's <I>Public Interest</I>
called, &quot;The Declining Well-Being of America's Youth.&quot;
The article began by arguing that the 1960s and the 1970s should
have been a golden age for young people if you look simply at
the factors social scientists say are most critical to healthy
child development.  During this time period, median family income
rose, average family size declined, and the educational background
of parents increased.  Moreover, Uhlenberg reported that the 1960s
and the 1970s were a time when there was a great deal of government
spending on programs directed toward children, most especially
public education.

<p>

Yet, at the end of this 20 year period, children's lives had not
improved dramatically.  Quite the opposite.  Citing a litany of
statistical indicators that would later make their way into Bill
Bennett's index, Uhlenberg showed that virtually every common
measurement -- teen pregnancy, juvenile crime, school test scores,
and the rest -- showed a decline in the well-being of America's
youth.

<p>

In reporting these (surprising) results, Uhlenberg challenged
social scientists -- and the public policymakers who feed off
of their work -- to consider the limits and the inevitable shortcomings
of their work.  He wrote:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Could it be that social scientists have overlooked the most crucial
determinants of children's welfare?  Could a preoccupation with
variables that are amenable to empirical measurement or to public
policy manipulation have diverted attention from variables that
are more important?</i>

</blockquote><p>

If, according to Uhlenberg, most of the scientific and policy
elite were barking up the wrong tree, what did he and his colleague
believe was responsible for the decline in children's well being
during the 1960s and 70s? Interestingly, Uhlenberg attributed
this decline to a decrease in &quot;sacrificial love.&quot;  Now,
he didn't use those words exactly.  No self-respecting social
scientist would ever use the &quot;L&quot;-word in a scholarly
journal, even one as unprententious as <I>The Public Interest</I>.
But make no mistake -- that is precisely what Uhlenberg was talking
about.  In fact, he said that while there had been a significant
increase in public investments in children, there had been a corresponding
decrease in private investments in children.  Most notably, there
had been a significant decline in the number of children that
were being raised in broken homes and a decline as well in the
amount of time two-earner families were spending with their children.

<p>

All of this gave Uhlenberg reason to believe that there were more
kids growing up without the &quot;one key ingredient&quot; that
Cornell psychologist Urie Brofenbrenner has called essential to
successful child development -- that &quot;someone has to be crazy
about the kid.&quot;

<p>

Now Uhlenberg admitted, of course, that &quot;craziness&quot;
about children is something very difficult for social scientists
to measure.  He wrote:

<p><blockquote>

<i>It is very difficult to define and even more difficult to measure
the quality of relationships.  It is even more difficult to design
policies for improving the relationships between individuals in
an intimate environment.  By contrast, measures of income, or
inequality, or family size or school expenditures are rather straightforward,
and policies designed to transfer more goods and services to children
can be conducted with relative ease.  But if the problems of American
youth stem from the state of parent-child relationships, those
who propose to improve the situation by designing policies which
bypass the family are embarking on a futile quest.  Perhaps we
are faced with a situation in which there is no change in public
policy that can have much effect or at least it seems that the
changes needed lie in an entirely different direction than those
generally advocated.</i>

</blockquote><p>

The first lesson, then, that we can derive from Peter Uhlenberg's
work is that we need to appreciate the limits of social science
and the limits of public policy.  Certainly this is a lesson for
liberals  in our day who have, over the course of the last several
decades, put a great deal of hope in government programs.  Not
only have these programs often failed to meet the high-minded,
well-intentioned goals of their sponsors, but they have in many
cases had all sorts of unintended consequences that have made
matters worse.  As Charles Murray has noted, the classic example
of the Law of Unintended Consequences is the modern welfare state,
and specifically the provision of cash entitlements to women who
bear children out of wedlock.  While such programs were intended
to help single mothers deal with a very difficult situation, they
have actually had the effect of encouraging greater illegitimacy
while discouraging the very behaviors likely to help one avoid
or overcome poverty.

<p>

Clearly, for those of us who see the folly of big government and
who want to see the well-being of children improve, there is much
work to be done in the public policy arena.  We need to be about
the business of clearing the underbrush of government programs
that are choking the health of our society and exacerbating many
of the social problems entrenched especially in the inner city.
We need to offer tax relief for families with children to make
it easier for parents to invest time in their children.  We need
to  pass divorce reform legislation that makes it considerably
more difficult (if not impossible) for individuals to walk away
from their marital commitments unilaterally.  We need to pass
school choice measures that make it easier for parents to be involved
in the most important decisions surrounding their children's education.

<p>

In addition to the conventional, pro-family policy agenda, we
need to consider other issues that affect the well-being of America's
children.  For example, I would like to see an investigation into
the role of old-age entitlements and the degree to which many
well-intentioned programs diminish bonds between generations.
I'd also like to see an exploration of zoning ordinances, and
the degree to which they contribute to the fact that many Americans
live in cookie-cutter enclaves with people whose social class,
race, age, and income are very much like their own.

<p>

Having said that, there is reason for liberals to take note of
Uhlenberg's observations about the limits of public policy (and
having argued for a conservative counter-revolution to free Americans
from the influence of big government), I think it is important
to encourage conservatives to heed Uhlenberg's cautions about
the limits of public policy as well.  Conservatives -- most especially,
religious conservatives -- should be careful not to place too
much hope in a political revolution. Yes, a conservative revolution
can bring about pro-family tax relief -- but it cannot guarantee
that parents will spend the extra discretionary time tax cuts
buy investing in their children.  Yes, conservative revolutionaries
can straighten out divorce laws -- but no law can make a man love
his wife in the way that he ought.  Yes, conservative revolutionaries
can give parents school choice -- but choice alone cannot guarantee
the kind of parental involvement that is so critical to student
achievement.

<p>

Now my point is not to suggest that public policy does not matter.
Obviously, it matters a great deal.  My point instead is simply
to suggest that a conservative revolution cannot produce the shining
city on a hill that Margaret Thatcher referred to last night.
I think we need to be reminded of this particularly since this
is an election year, when many Americans, to one degree or another,
imagine some sort of political knight in shining armor riding
in to make everything right with the world.  Surely, the outcome
of elections is critically important, but it is a mistake to put
our hope in a political savior.   As Peter Uhlenberg's work reminds
us, we must appreciate both the benefits and the limits of science
and government.  We must not look to either to save us.

<p>

The second lesson we need to learn from Dr. Uhlenberg's work may
surprise you.  In a 1986 speech he gave amplifying some of the
themes that he had originally laid out in the <I>Public Interest</I>
article, Uhlenberg said it takes a whole village to raise a child.
Now, those weren't his exact words.  And he had something very
different in mind than some who have picked up on this theme in
recent months.  But Uhlenberg makes an interesting -- and much
needed -- point.  Here's what he says:

<p><blockquote>

<i>The isolated nuclear family tends to be a fragile and vulnerable
organization.  Critics of the nuclear family are correct in asserting
that it is unreasonable to expect a husband and wife to meet all
of the social, economic, and emotional needs of each other and
of their children, especially in times of crisis.</i>

</blockquote><p>

He goes on later in his speech to say:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Families are not designed to stand in isolation but rather should
be enmeshed in strong webs of other supportive relationships.
The caring and rearing of children is certainly the responsibility
of parents, and the burdens and the joys of child rearing should
be shared with persons outside of the nuclear family.</i>

</blockquote><p>

Lest one interpret this as a call for government activism to support
families, Uhlenberg is quick to point out that he has something
very different in mind.  He said, &quot;Rather than concluding
that families should be bypassed and that government bureaucracies
relied upon to meet these needs, families could be encouraged
to join together in supportive networks.&quot;

<p>

I hadn't really given a great deal of thought to Uhlenberg's observations
about the importance of supportive networks until two years ago
when a not-so-random-act-of-kindness by a woman named Betty Rudisill
left me speechless.

<p>

Betty Rudisill is a woman who lives in the &quot;village&quot;
where I was raised.  A long-time family friend and one-time neighbor,
Mrs. Rudisill is best remembered by me as the woman who used to
save all her junk mail so that I could put it in my &quot;business
box&quot; and pretend to be a businessman.  (Some would say that
I am still pretending.)

<p>

Mrs. Rudisill is one of the first people my mother turned to when
she needed help of some kind with her kids.  Indeed, it was at
Mrs. Rudisill's house one day after school that I received a jubilant
phone call from my father at the hospital maternity ward telling
me that I had a new kid brother.

<p>

Well, I haven't seen Betty Rudisill in probably 10 years.  But
a couple of years ago, she learned that my two oldest kids were
in town visiting their grandparents.  So, she invited my mother
to bring the kids over to her house for a little tea party.  Mrs.
Rudisill then proceeded to offer these two kids she had never
even met before one of the most enchanting afternoons of their
young lives.  Mrs. Rudisill introduced my daughter to an elaborate
collection of delicate dolls with which her daughter had once
played.  And she gave my boy an opportunity to thoroughly check
out the collection of Matchbox cars that had once delighted her
son.  Needless to say, it was quite a party.  And it made quite
an impression on my children.

<p>

Now, I don't want to get carried away here.  I don't want to exaggerate
the importance of this episode.  In the end, Mrs. Rudisill's tea
party is not apt to rank as one of the most important events in
my children's lives.  Times spent with family members like Mom
and Dad and Grandmother and Papa are likely to be far more important.

<p>

But it is also true that my children's lives are richer because
of Mrs. Rudisill's kindness.  Indeed, episodes like this serve
to reinforce what my wife and I try to teach our children with
our words and actions -- that they are more of a delight than
a bother, that they are important human beings who are worth making
a fuss over.

<p>

Part of the reason why Mrs. Rudisill's tea party had such an effect
on me is that it caused me to ask:  Who will be the Betty Rudisill
in the lives of my future grandchildren when my kids send their
kids to come visit us?  And in what child's life will my wife
and I get to play the role of a Betty Rudisill?

<p>

I find myself not being able to answer those kinds of questions
as easily as I suspect my parent's generation answered them. 
And given the go-go pace of modern life, the growing transience
of our population, the weakening of community ties, and the waning
appreciation for those who quietly invest their lives in other
people, I suspect that many of my peers would struggle with these
questions as well.

<p>

In a recent article, author John Whitehead observed:

<p><blockquote>

<i>The entire concept of the neighborhood is lost to us, and our
children are growing up in a bland world.  Rarely can a child
see people working at their trades, for everyone is out of sight.
Children can no longer listen to community talk at the post office
or at the park bench and there are no abandoned houses, barns,
or attics that children can safely explore.  Forced by the many
dangers of an empty home and neighborhood to remain behind locked
doors, children wile away their hours after school by interacting
with their computers and video games.  Cyberspace has replaced
the neighborhoods familiar to their grandparents.</i>

</blockquote><p>

Now, again, don't misunderstand me.  I am not saying -- nor was
Uhlenberg saying -- that we should devote more attention to rebuilding
strong neighborhoods and communities than we do to rebuilding
strong families.  Quite the opposite.  But the health of the nuclear
family is significantly affected by the strength of the surrounding
community.  In fact, even if we were only concerned about families,
we would need to give attention to the strength and health of
the social networks in which families are enmeshed.

<p>

In this regard, I was struck several years ago by some surprising
differences in divorce rates by region.  Interestingly, divorce
rates tend to be significantly higher in the Sunbelt (and even
Bible Belt) regions of the country than in the Northeast or Midwest.
There are a number of reasons for this, but University of Texas
sociologist Norval Glenn has determined that the single greatest
predictor of divorce rates in a community is the degree to which
the people are rooted in a larger social network.  In areas of
the Midwest and the Northeast where you have more stable communities
-- where you often have strong ethnic communities -- divorce rates
tend to be lower because there is a surrounding web of individuals
who are working to try to help that couple succeed.  In more transient
areas of the country, particularly in areas where there is low
church participation, divorce rates tend to be higher because
many couples are existing very much as Uhlenberg described --
in isolation, lacking some type of supporting network to help
them and to challenge them and to hold them accountable.

<p>

I must say here that Dr. Uhlenberg not only can speak to this
question from his professional observations as a scholar.  But
he can also speak to this concern from his own personal experience.
I don't know about you, but my family has taken a great interest
in the new television show, <I>Second Noah,</I> that depicts the
life of a couple that is based here in Tampa.  The couple has
a rather unique story.  Over the course of time, they have adopted
eight or 10 different kids of varying races and backgrounds to
raise as their own.

<p>

In many ways, that television show closely resembles the life
of Peter Uhlenberg and his wife Pam.  Over the last two decades,
they have adopted a dozen or so children.  Some of these children
have physical handicaps; some come from mixed racial backgrounds;
some have learning disabilities; some have no special needs --
except the need for a devoted Mom and Dad. If you wish to pay
tribute to the kinds of sacrifices that Peter Uhlenberg and his
wife are making in their lives with those kids, they will be quick
to tell you that it would not be possible for them to be involved
in the work that they are doing in their home were it not for
the surrounding network of support that they get from the local
church congregation in which they play a part.  Indeed, there
are members of that congregation that have established big brother
or big sister relationships with different members of the Uhlenberg
family.  I'm sure that they are right-that if it were not for
that supportive network, the really heroic work that Peter Uhlenberg
and his wife are doing would  be very difficult, if not impossible.

<p>

The third lesson, then, that I think we can learn from Peter and
his wife (and his entire congregation, for that matter) is this
-- if we hope to turn things around in this country, if we hope
to see America become the shining city on a hill, it's going to
cost us something.  It's going to cost us personally. It's going
to require sacrificial love on our part, if I can use the &quot;L&quot;-word.
I'm not speaking of the hollow, feel-good love that was celebrated
by the '60s counterculture when Peter Uhlenberg was a student
at the University of California at Berkeley.  I'm speaking about
the gritty, unconditional, sacrificial love that he and his wife
have found and are now sharing with their kids.  That is a love
that is costly, to be sure, but it is a love that offers great
rewards.

<p>

I don't know about you, but I am very much looking forward to
the Olympics that will take place later this year.  I always set
aside time to view them because I'm interested in seeing who will
show themselves to be the fastest sprinter or the highest jumper
or the longest javelin thrower.  But the greatest honor that is
reserved at the Olympics goes not to one of these individuals
who has managed to develop a specialized skill to a greater extent
than anyone else.  The greatest honor goes to two athletes; one
in the men's division called a decathlete who participates in
10 different events, and the other to a female heptathlete who
participates in seven different athletic events.  Now these athletes
cannot outperform everyone on the planet in every single one of
these categories.  Instead, they are the athletes best able to
outperform others in a combination of them all.  They are, in
a sense, the best all-around or most well-rounded athletes.

<p>

We live in a day when 15 minutes or more of fame is quite often
available to anyone who can excel in a single area of life --
even if that success comes at the expense of meeting more important
responsibilities in other areas of life. In many ways, then,
the challenge for each of us personally is not just to seek to
make an important contribution in our work, or in our neighborhood,
or in our churches or synagogues, or in our homes.  It is instead
to seek to make an important contribution in all of these areas
simultaneously.  The challenge for us is to strive to be as well
rounded as the decathlete or the heptathlete, never allowing our
pursuit of excellence in one area to come at the expense of the
others.

<p>

Peter Uhlenberg, in my mind, is meeting that challenge.  He is
a whole man.  If the serious social problems Uhlenberg tracks
in his work are to be reversed, we will need to become more like
him -- people who not only wring our hands about various social
problems, but people who take personal action in our own homes
and neighborhoods to address these serious problems.

<p>

Thank you very much.

<title>'HOMOSEXUAL CORRECTNESS' ADVANCES IN AMERICA'S SCHOOLS</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">

<h2>'HOMOSEXUAL CORRECTNESS'<br>
ADVANCES IN AMERICA'S SCHOOLS</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by<br>
Peter LaBarbera</center>

<p>

This presentation was given at a July 2, 1996 briefing on Capitol
Hill regarding the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA).  The briefing
was sponsored by the Family Research Council.</i>

<p><br>

<center>&quot;Marriages between homosexuals should be recognized....<br>
We must accept a homosexual orientation in young people in the same<br>
manner we accept a heterosexual orientation....&quot;</center>

<p>

These are two recommendations by gay activist Paul Gibson in his
paper, &quot;Gay Male and Lesbian Youth Suicide,&quot; which is
being used to promote &quot;gay friendly&quot; policies in schools
nationwide.  Recent months and years have witnessed the beginnings
of an unprecedented campaign by homosexual activists to affirm
homosexuality and so-called &quot;gay youth&quot; in schools.
This effort, advanced on a hundred fronts from Utah to New Hampshire,
has made steady gains while the nation's attention is focused
on another radical homosexual goal: legalizing gay &quot;marriage.&quot;

<p>

The campaign to teach schoolchildren and teens that &quot;gay
is OK&quot; benefits from the usual coordination of a united &quot;gay&quot;
movement which has the advantage of pressing for a <I>single radical
goal</I>, versus its pro-family opponents who face a multiplicity
of challenges.  Parents who simply want a good education for their
children are increasingly confronted with the prospect of seeing
precious educational resources spent on talking about homosexuality,
and they are drawn into time-consuming and divisive debates over
this issue.

<p>

Of course, the questions of homosexuality instruction in schools
and &quot;gay marriage&quot; are linked, as homosexual activists
and their educational allies argue that students need to be presented
with &quot;positive&quot; images of &quot;gay role models&quot;
to counter the negative representations of &quot;homophobic&quot;
society.  What could be more positive than teaching children that
-- just like heterosexuals -- gays and lesbians get married and
raise children?

<p>

As surely as summer follows spring, legal homosexual &quot;marriage&quot;
would quickly be seized upon by pro-gay educators as the latest
teaching tool to inculcate the normalcy of homosexuality to young 
minds.  How young?  The publishers of the latest homosexual children's 
book, &quot;Daddy's Wedding&quot; tell us it is &quot;appropriate 
for children ages 2 to 6.&quot; The book uses colorful pictures to 
tell the story of a young boy, Nick, who is &quot;best man&quot; at 
the &quot;wedding&quot; ceremony between his &quot;gay&quot; daddy 
and his homosexual lover. One page shows the men kissing at the altar 
as young Nick looks on.  &quot;Daddy's Wedding&quot; is published by the 
same company that gave us &quot;Heather Has Two Mommies&quot; and 
&quot;Daddy's Roommate.&quot;

<center><h3>THE &QUOT;GAY YOUTH&QUOT; CAMPAIGN AND &QUOT;SAFE 
SCHOOLS&QUOT;</h3></center>

<p>

Efforts to affirm so-called homosexual youth advance under the
rubric of promoting &quot;diversity&quot; and enhancing 
&quot;self-esteem&quot; -- two fads in today's faltering public 
schools.  The campaign rests on several tendentious suppositions 
that have barely begun to be fully debated by larger society, 
foremost among them is the myth that a certain percentage of kids 
have a &quot;gay&quot; (or <I>lesbian, bisexual or transgendered</I>) 
&quot;identity&quot; which they were likely born with, and which is 
unchangeable. Educators are tasked with affirming such children and 
helping them cope in the midst of a homophobic culture.

<p>

With this goal in mind of shoring up the &quot;gay minority&quot;
of students, gay activists have chosen a strategy of promoting,
not homosexuality, they say, but &quot;safe schools.&quot;  The
cunning strategy relies heavily on winning public sympathy for
&quot;gay youth&quot; as a besieged victim group in schools. 
It was  best outlined in a recent speech by Kevin Jennings, a
homosexual and former high school teacher who is now executive
director of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Teachers Network (GLSTN),
a 3,000-member organization crusading against &quot;homophobia&quot;
in schools.  Listen to Jennings describe how the &quot;safe schools&quot;
approach helped cripple the pro-family opposition and win passage
in Massachusetts of a 1994 law -- the first of its kind in the
nation -- banning &quot;discrimination&quot; in public schools
based on &quot;sexual orientation:&quot;

<p><blockquote>

<i>We immediately seized upon the opponents' calling card -- safety
-- and explained how homophobia represents a threat to students'
safely by creating a climate where violence, name-calling, health
problems, and suicide are common....We knew that, confronted with
real-life stories of youth who had suffered from homophobia, our
opponents would automatically be on the defensive:  they would
have to attack people who had already been victimized once, which
put them in a bully position from which it would be hard to emerge
looking good.</i>

</blockquote><p>

Keeping the above victim imagery in mind, it is easy to envision
pro-gay educators teaching their youthful subjects that the inability
of homosexuals to get married is just one more in a litany of
&quot;civil rights&quot; denied to homosexuals.  Hopefully this
will not be offered as part of a history course in the near or
distant future.

<p>

<center><h3>THE SUICIDE SCAM</h3></center>

<p>

Homosexual activists have shamelessly exploited the issue of &quot;gay
youth&quot; suicide to promote pro-homosexuality programs in schools,
hyping a non-existent &quot;epidemic&quot; to silence their critics
and frame the debate before an emotionally sympathetic public.
As Jennings said, &quot;In Massachusetts, no one could speak
up against our frame and say, 'Why yes, I do think students should
kill themselves.'  This allowed us to set the terms of the debate.&quot;

<p>

There are two major problems with Jennings' assertion.  Firstly,
his claim of a rash of &quot;gay youth&quot; suicides is baseless,
and relies mainly on a thoroughly discredited paper by a homosexual
activist.  Secondly, even it were true that self-perceived 'homosexuals'
are prone to commit suicide in higher numbers than other youth,
it does not mean that schools should be <I>confirming</I> young
teens in an immoral and dangerous lifestyle.  In fact, disproportionate
rates of (adult) suicide in even the most &quot;gay-friendly&quot;
areas like San Francisco indicate that this is yet another sad
fact of homosexual life, not the fault of society.  As Alan Medenger,
a former homosexual, says, &quot;It is tragic, even criminal,
to lead a child into homosexuality because he or she showed some
degree of sexual confusion in adolescence.&quot;

<p>

And yet confirming &quot;gay youth&quot; in their homosexuality
is precisely the goal of GLSTN and countless other homosexual
organizations who routinely repeat the claim that homosexual youth
make up one-third of all youth suicides.  The figure has its origins
in a paper San Francisco gay activist Paul Gibson wrote that was
part of an Health and Human Services report on youth suicide.
Gibson's report, which was repudiated by HHS Secretary Louis
Sullivan, made the claim that &quot;gay youth&quot; made up &quot;30
percent&quot; of all youth suicides by extrapolating from another
bogus &quot;gay&quot; number -- that homosexuals represent 10
percent of the population.  David Shaffer, a Columbia University
psychiatrist and one of the world's leading specialists on adolescent
suicide, said, &quot;I struggled for a long time over [Gibson's]
mathematics, but in the end it seemed more hocus-pocus than math.&quot;
Shaffer also wrote that Gibson's and others' claims that gay
suicide is common is &quot;an excellent example of how bad research
provides misleading answers that can come home to roost.&quot;

<p>

To illustrate the tendentious nature of Paul Gibson's &quot;research,&quot;
it is useful to examine some of his other claims and recommendations
found in the paper he submitted to HHS and later repudiated by
Secretary Sullivan:

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;A substantial number of youth -- perhaps one in 10 --
have a primary gay male, lesbian or bisexual orientation....&quot;

<p>

&quot;Transsexual youth who are open about their identity face
extreme abuse and rejection from their families....The only known
course of treatment is to help transsexuals adjust to their believed
gender identity and obtain sex-assignment surgery.  Most transsexual
youth, however, are unable to obtain or afford the help they need
in resolving their identity conflicts...&quot;

<p>

&quot;Homosexuality...is a natural and healthy expression of
human sexuality...All youth need to be presented with positive
information about homosexuality that presents it as a viable adaptation....It
is important for schools to hire openly gay male and lesbian teachers
to serve as role models and resource people for gay youth.&quot;

<p>

&quot;Religions need to reassess homosexuality in a positive
context within their belief systems....Religions should also take
responsibility for providing their families and membership with
positive information about homosexuality that discourages the
oppression of lesbians and gay men.  Faiths that condemn homosexuality
should recognize how they contribute to the rejection of gay youth
by their families and suicide among lesbians and gay male youth.&quot;</i>

</blockquote><p>

So, the next time you hear a homosexual activist claim that a
&quot;government study&quot; found that 30 percent of all youth
suicides are committed by homosexuals, remember that the same
gay activist who produced that &quot;study&quot; also calls for
reaching out to &quot;transsexual youth&quot; and says religions
need to shed their homophobia.

<p>

<center><h3>OTHER PRO-GAY PROGRAMS IN SCHOOLS</h3></center>

<p>

Beyond hyping suicide as a justification for homosexual-affirming
policies in schools, gay educators and their allies are promoting
a variety of other strategies to accomplish their goal of normalizing
homosexuality, among them:

<p><ul>

<li>Promoting the celebration of &quot;Gay History Month&quot;
in schools to provide students with positive homosexual role models.
In these programs, notables like First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt
are often portrayed factually as &quot;gay&quot; without giving
contradictory historical evidence.  Even if such figures did have
homosexual tendencies, many question why this aspect of their
lives should be stressed in history lessons.  Brilliance is, sadly,
often accompanied by destructive behavior.  Certainly quite an
impressive list of historical notables could be compiled if it
were to be decided that schools should celebrate &quot;Alcoholic
History Month&quot; or &quot;Adulterers History Month.&quot;

<p>

<li>Creating &quot;gay-straight&quot; youth alliances in high
schools, which frequently become conduits for pro-homosexual propagandizing
to student bodies. In the conservative town of Dedham, Massachusetts,
this was done with taxpayer monies as parents were stunned to
learn that a &quot;gay-straight&quot; alliance (which they didn't
even know existed) had received $2,000 in state funds to distribute
a questionnaire on &quot;gay&quot; issues to all homerooms at
the local high school.  One of the survey's questions was, &quot;Do
you feel lesbian or gay people should be allowed to marry?&quot;
It goes without saying that &quot;gay-straight&quot; youth groups
play perfectly to a youngster's tendency to adopt political positions
contrary to those of his or her parents.  Hence rallying behind
the &quot;civil rights&quot; of fellow &quot;gay&quot; students
wins ample student support and will be fully exploited by adult
homosexual activist groups like GLSTN.

<p>

<li>Affirming the right of openly homosexual teachers to proudly
affirm their gay &quot;identity&quot; to schoolchildren.  One
lesbian teacher recently made headlines by using a pink triangle
to inform students that her class was a &quot;safe zone&quot;
for &quot;gays.&quot;  Parents were not informed of the decision.
GLSTN held five regional conferences for homosexual teachers
during the 1996-96 school year. At one such conference in Los
Angeles, lesbian activist Donna Redwing declared, &quot;We're
here, we're queer, we're in the classroom.&quot;  The assembled
GLSTN-affiliated teachers cheered Redwing's declaration.  Hence
GLSTN conferences serve to radicalize homosexual teachers, making
them more likely to openly promote homosexuality as something
positive (or at least benign or neutral) to their students when
they return to their classrooms.

<p>

<li>Address the issue of how to combat &quot;homophobic&quot;
attitudes in young schoolchildren (kindergarten through sixth-grade).
The homosexual activist group GLAAD (Gay and Lesbian Alliance
Against Defamation) recently called on the FCC to demand that
children's television (&quot;Ernie and Bert,&quot; etc.) be used
to teach children about the &quot;horrors of homophobia.&quot;

</ul><p>

Homosexual activists are deadly serious about using the education
process to teach kids that homosexuality is okay, and that anyone
who thinks otherwise is a &quot;bigot.&quot;  If parents are not
vigilant in ferreting out such propaganda and countering it, they
will witness the rise of a generation hostile to five millennia
of Judeo-Christian teaching proscribing homosexual behavior.

<title>THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT: EXPERT TESTIMONY</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">

<h2>THE DEFENSE OF<br>
MARRIAGE ACT:<br>
EXPERT TESTIMONY</h2></center>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>The following are excerpts from a July 2, 1996 Capitol Hill
briefing regarding the Defense of Marriage Act.  The briefing
was sponsored by the Family Research Council.</i>

<p>

<center><h3>RESEARCH</h3></center>

<p>

&quot;Two profoundly mistaken ideas have sunk deeply into public
sentiment where they exert a powerful influence in the shaping
of public policy as it relates to family, sexuality and marriage.
These are: 1) That homosexuality is genetic, and that consequently,
2) Homosexuality is unchangeable.  Neither idea is true, and in
fact there is a mountain of scientific evidence to the contrary.
The Americans being most severely harmed by the propagation of
these untruths are the very large number of homosexuals who wish
nothing more than to rid themselves of these unwanted impulses
and establish quiet marriages and families.  The gay and lesbian
activism that claims to speak for these many struggling fellow
citizens speaks for their interests in no way whatsoever.  Completely
ignored are the very large number of people who have already succeeded
in leaving homosexuality behind....Epidemiologists around the
country have confirmed that among young gay men there is a significant
return to the unsafest of sexual practices in spite of over fifteen
years of massively-funded education programs.  They have also
found that a shocking 30 percent of all currently 20-year-old
young men who identify themselves as 'gay' will be either HIV-positive
or dead of AIDS by the time they are 30. Yet, as is widely known
and confirmed by recent research, many of these young men will
spontaneously leave homosexuality behind....With respect to genetics,
even those recent studies widely touted as demonstrating the innate,
biological and genetically determined nature of homosexuality
demonstrate precisely the contrary, and a careful reading of the
authors themselves makes this clear.&quot; -- <I>Jeffrey B. Satinover,
M.D., psychiatrist, former Fellow in Psychiatry and Child Psychiatry
at Yale University, and author of</I> Homosexuality and the Politics
of Truth.

<p>

<center><h3>THE LAW AND MARRIAGE</h3></center>

<p>

&quot;Every argument for gay marriage is an argument that would
support polygamy.  The gay activists may not have the remotest
interest in promoting polygamy, but this much may fairly be said: They 
have the most profound interest, rooted in the logic of their doctrine,
in discrediting the notion that marriage finds its defining ground
in 'nature.'  Their rhetorical strategy, their public arguments,
have all been directed explicitly to the derision of that claim
that sexuality in the strictest sense involves the sexuality 'imprinted
in our natures.'  For that reason, we can count on the fact that
there will be someone, somewhere, ready to press this issue by
raising a challenge in the court and testing the limits even further.
The irony then is that the notion of marriage cannot accommodate
couples of the same sex without so altering the cast or character
of marriage that it will cease to be that special relation, which
seems to be the object of such deep craving now for so many people.
Once the notion of marriage is broadened in that way, it will
simply not be tenable any longer to hold up marriage, in the laws,
as a relation that deserves a special place, a special commendation
-- a special effort to sustain and promote it.  This Act is the
most delicate and limited measure that the Congress could produce
on the subject.  It treats subjects that are evidently within
the reach of the Congress, and it makes the least intrusion into
the domain of State law.  What other institution could possibly
have the authority to clarify the meaning of terms in federal
legislation, if not the federal legislature?&quot; -- <I>Hadley
Arkes, Professor of Jurisprudence and American Institutions at
Amherst College.</I>

<p>

<center><h3>REAL RECOVERY</h3></center>

<p>

&quot;I speak to you today not just as an observer of this movement,
but as one of them.  I am a former homosexual.  I lived that lifestyle
from the time I was 17 until I was 26.  I entered the gay lifestyle
thinking that there really wasn't any choice for me.  What I didn't
realize is that although I didn't choose to be homosexual, I did
not have to be gay. I had a choice.  I could change my orientation
from gay to straight. My healing process was a long and difficult
one.  However, change is possible.  The four national ex-gay networks
are currently ministering to more than 10,000 former homosexuals.
Many of us are sick and tired of a lifestyle that initially seems
very freeing but eventually puts us in all kinds of bondage and
eventually will kill us. I have lost over 35 of my friends and
acquaintances to the disease of AIDS and don't want to see one
more person become infected with this deadly disease.  The organized
gay community is telling us that AIDS is no longer a gay disease
and, although it is spreading into the heterosexual population
in this country very quickly, 61 percent of people that are coming
down with this deadly disease in the U.S. are homosexual, according
to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.  America must take
a very strong stand against the very highly organized gay community
in this country by supporting The Defense of Marriage Act.  If
we don't say 'no' to the organized gay community now, the United
States will suffer the consequences of our complacency.  America
needs to start helping homosexuals recover from their sexual brokenness.
Putting a stamp of approval on a lifestyle by legally recognizing
it (and even calling it marriage) is not really helping homosexuals.
It's perpetuating a myth and delivering them over to a death-style.&quot;
-- <I>Anthony Falzarano, former homosexual, executive director
of Transformation Ministries.</I>

<p>

<center><h3>THE GAY RIGHTS AGENDA</h3></center>

<p>

&quot;Most Americans believe in the philosophy of 'live and let
live.'  They don't want to make the plight of homosexuals any
more difficult than it already is.  But tolerance is not what
homosexual activists are seeking.  They are demanding that society
elevate homosexuality to the moral level of marriage.  When they
bring the law into it, they are no longer just minding their own
business, but imposing it on every single citizen.  If you are
a devout Christian, Jew or Muslim, or merely someone who believes
homosexuality is immoral and harmful, and the law declares homosexuality
a protected status, then your personal beliefs are now outside
civil law.  This has very serious implications, for if the law
declares opposition to homosexuality as bigotry, then the entire
power of the civil rights apparatus can be brought against you.
Businessmen will have to subsidize homosexuality or face legal
sanctions; schoolchildren will have to be taught that homosexuality
is the equivalent of marital love; religious people will be told
their beliefs are no longer valid, and their independence will
be challenged....The Boy Scouts of America are under legal attack
in the states which have special rights for 'sexual orientation.'
The Scouts, a private group, are being told to abandon their
moral code of more than 80 years and to place young boys under
homosexual men on camping trips -- or face financial ruin.  The
attack against the Scouts is really an attack on parents, because
parents have the right, in a free nation, to entrust their children
to organizations that reflect the parents' most deeply held beliefs.
If they cannot do this, then we are living in tyranny.&quot;
-- <I>Robert H. Knight, director of cultural studies at the Family
Research Council.</I>

<p>

<center><h3>THE MYTH OF 'GAY TEEN SUICIDE'</h3></center>

<p>

&quot;Homosexual activists have shamelessly exploited the issue
of 'gay youth' suicide to promote pro-homosexuality programs in
schools, hyping a non-existent 'epidemic' to silence their critics
and frame the debate before an emotionally sympathetic public.
As (homosexual and former high school teacher Kevin) Jennings
recently said, 'In Massachusetts, no one could speak up against
our frame and say, &quot;Why yes, I do think students should kill
themselves.&quot;  This allowed us to set the terms of the debate.'
(Editor's note:  Jennings is now executive director of the Gay,
Lesbian and Straight Teacher's Network, or GLSTN, a 3,000-member
organization crusading against &quot;homophophia&quot; in schools.)
There are two major problems with Jennings' assertion.  Firstly,
his claim of a rash of 'gay youth' suicides is baseless, and relies
mainly on a thoroughly discredited paper by a homosexual activist.
Secondly, even it were true that self-perceived 'homosexuals'
are prone to commit suicide in higher numbers than other youth,
it does not mean that schools should be <I>confirming</I> young
teens in an immoral and dangerous lifestyle.  In fact, disproportionate
rates of (adult) suicide in even the most 'gay-friendly' areas
like San Francisco indicate that this is yet another sad fact
of homosexual life, not the fault of society....And yet confirming
'gay youth' in their homosexuality is precisely the goal of GLSTN
and countless other homosexual organizations who routinely repeat
the claim that homosexual youth make up one-third of all youth
suicides.  The figure has its origins in a paper San Francisco
gay activist Paul Gibson wrote that was part of a Health and Human 
Services report on youth suicide.  Gibson's report, which was repudiated 
by HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan, made the claim that 'gay youth' made
up '30 percent' of all youth suicides by extrapolating from another
bogus 'gay' number -- that homosexuals represent 10 percent of
the population.  David Shaffer, a Columbia University psychiatrist
and one of the world's leading specialists on adolescent suicide,
said, 'I struggled for a long time over [Gibson's] mathematics,
but in the end it seemed more hocus-pocus than math.'  Shaffer
also wrote that Gibson's and others' claims that gay suicide is
common is 'an excellent example of how bad research provides misleading
answers that can come home to roost.'&quot; -- <I>Peter LaBarbera,
editor and founder of</I> The Lambda Report on Homosexuality.

<p>

<center><h3>THE EFFECTS ON SAME-SEX FRIENDSHIPS</h3></center>

<p>

&quot;Many...(junior and high school) teens and preteens are entering
a phase in their psychosocial development where it is characteristic
for girls to have one close girlfriend and boys to have one close
boyfriend.  This is an important phase in learning emotional intimacy
that is crucial to forming healthy relationships....So what happens
to the preteens and teens who receive information about homosexuality
and same-sex 'marriages' at the same time that they are bonding
with their friends (around the ages of 11-14)...for many children
with family or personal problems and no one to turn to for help,
there may be confusion.  That confusion can turn to a fear that
they may be homosexual, when they are not.  They may then turn
away from their friends and interrupt an important developmental
process.  In some cases, because of the confusion about this topic,
well-meaning but misguided counselors would even have these children
believe that they are homosexual, when they are not even sexually
mature.&quot; -- <I>Brenda Destro, D.S.W., Adjunct Professor for
Studies on Marriage and Family at the John Paul II Institute and
former social work consultant for the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services Office of Adolescent Pregnancy and the Institute
for Human Resources (IHR).</I>

<p>

<center><h3>NO 'RIGHT' TO ADOPT</h3></center>

<p>

&quot;Unfortunately, in recent years, some who have attempted
to reform adoption laws and policies are not addressing the needs
of children, but instead are promoting the cause of adults.  Discussions
about 'rights to adopt' are clearly not child-centered, but 
adult-driven....Obviously, if states begin to recognize marriage 
between homosexuals, it will likely become easier for two homosexuals to 
adopt a child because they will be meeting the marriage requirement....There
is no 'right' to adopt, and to create one would be contrary to
the best interests of children, because instead of finding the
most appropriate family for a child, the state and its agents
would have to ensure that adults are allowed to adopt a child.
Since a 'right' is a guarantee, the state would be required to
'guarantee' a child for adoption.  The absurdity of that position
is obvious.&quot; -- <I>Mary Beth Style, M.S.W., former vice president
for policy and practice of the National Council for Adoption.</I>

<p>

<center><h3>SEX EDUCATION</h3></center>

<p>

&quot;Our students have been guinea pigs in Russian roulette with
their futures long enough....Our kids will be bombarded with the
propaganda from books such as <I>Heather Has Two Mommies</I>....Same-sex
marriage is a result of a destructive, narcissistic way of thinking
and of 'value-neutral' curriculums.  One can only shudder to consider
the horrific possibilities which may occur on the sexuality continuum
with the perpetuation of such policies....We have communicated
to students that all values are equal.  How ludicrous...&quot;
-- <I>Linda Page, former school principal, education consultant,
talk show host and writer.</I>

<h2>THE IMPLICATIONS OF<br>
GAY 'MARRIAGE'</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by<br>
Hadley Arkes</center>

<p>

This speech was presented at a July 2, 1996 Capitol Hill briefing 
regarding the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA).  The briefing was 
sponsored by the Family Research Council.</i>

<p>

During the hearings on the 
Defense of Marriage Act in May, Congressman Barney Frank (D-Mass.) posed
the rhetorical but earnest question:  Were he and his partner,
&quot;Herb&quot; -- settled, domesticated couple that they were
-- really imperilling the marriages of people in their neighborhood?
How could their example, as a gay couple, injure the institution
of marriage?  Had there been some decline, after all, in the attraction
of the sexes, so that men might cease being attracted to women
if they were suddenly more aware of gay men together as couples?
That would appear, on the surface, a plausible question, but
it masks a serious confusion about the standards of judgment or
evidence in assessing the problem.  We might as aptly ask whether
there would be any measurable fraying in the community if a brother
and sister took up residence as husband and wife.  Years ago,
in Stafford, Virginia, a 40-year-old mother was living in a common
law marriage with her 19-year-old son.  They were ordered by a
court to part, and as far as we know, their example produced no
breakdown of marriages in the town.  No one expects the sky to
fall in, or the local populace to break out in fits of stuttering.
That is not the test, and that is not the issue.

<p>

The question of what is suitable for marriage is quite separate from 
the matter of love, though it cannot finally be detached from love. 
No one doubts the love of men for men, or women for women, just as no
one doubts that there may be abiding relations of love between
brothers and sisters, grandparents and grandchildren.  In the
nature of things, nothing in those relations of love could possibly
be diminished in any way if they were not attended by penetration
or expressed in marriage.

<p>

As I remarked at the hearings in May,
it becomes impossible finally to discuss this matter of marriage
and sexuality without using the N-word:  nature.  The question
must return to that sexuality stamped in our natures, or what
has been called the &quot;natural teleology of the body&quot;
--  namely, the inescapable fact that only two people, not three,
only a man and a woman, can beget a child.  We don't need a marriage
to mark the presence of love, but a marriage marks something matchless
in a framework for the begetting and nurturance of children.
Even on those occasions when marriages break down, the framework
of law has the advantage at least of fixing responsibility for
the custody and care of children.

<p>

I posed then a question of principle
for the Committee on the Judiciary in this way:  If marriage were
detached from that natural teleology of the body, <i>on what ground
of principle could the law confine marriage to &quot;couples&quot;?</i>
If the law permitted the marriage of people of the same sex,
what is the ground of principle on which the law would refuse
to recognize a &quot;marriage&quot; in the people who profess
that their own love is not confined to a coupling of two, but
connected in a larger cluster of three or four?  The confining
of marriage to two may stand out then as nothing more than the
most arbitrary fixation on numbers.  But if that arrangement of
plural partners were permitted to people of the same sex, how
could it be denied in principle to ensembles of mixed sexes?
That is to say, we would be back, in principle, to the acceptance
of polygamy.

<p>

I sought to be clear, also, in the discussion
in the Judiciary Committee that I was not making a prediction
-- I was not predicting that, if we accepted same-sex marriage,
we would be engulfed by polygamy and incest.  I was a raising
question, again, of principle:  What was the ground on which the
law refused to accept the polygamous union once it accepted the
notion of gay marriage?  It could not be, &quot;That is not what
we do here,&quot; for that answer would suffice right now.  One
young legislator, testifying before the Committee, was pressed
on this matter of polygamy, and he replied that he simply understood
marriage as an exclusive contractual relation between two people.
Others might come back and retort that we happen to consider
marriage an exclusive, contractual relation between a man and
a woman.  On the level of assertion, one meets another;  but neither
one states a ground of principle for denying same-sex marriage
-- once marriage is detached, as I say, from its defining ground
in nature.

<p>

I would go further and say that I take Congressman
Frank and other gay activists at their word when they declare
that they do not wish to injure the family.  I credit their avowals
about their attachments to their own families, and their wish
that other people in the country may have the blessings of that
life in a family.  But the problem here, as I sought to explain,
was that their argument ran well beyond their intentions.  Those
arguments must put in place the kinds of premises and understandings
that make it impossible to reject any longer the claims for polygamy.
To put it another way, every argument for gay marriage is an
argument that would support polygamy.  The gay activists may not
have the remotest interest in promoting polygamy, but this much
may fairly be said:  They have the most profound interest, rooted
in the logic of their doctrine, in discrediting the notion that
marriage finds its defining ground in &quot;nature.&quot;  Their
rhetorical strategy, their public arguments, have all been directed
explicitly to the derision of that claim that sexuality in the
strictest sense involves the sexuality &quot;imprinted in our
natures.&quot;  For that reason, we can count on the fact that
there will be someone, somewhere, ready to press this this issue
by raising a challenge in the court and testing the limits even
further.

<p>

The irony then is that the notion of marriage cannot
accommodate couples of the same sex without so altering the cast
or character of marriage that it will cease to be that special
relation, which seems to be the object of such deep craving now
for so many people.  Once the notion of marriage is broadened
in that way, it will simply not be tenable any longer to hold
up marriage, in the laws, as a relation that deserves a special
place, a special commendation -- a special effort to sustain and
promote it.  And indeed, we fear that the movement to gay marriage
is fueled in part by a desire to remove that special standing
in principle -- to deny that there is anything about marriage
that deserves a special respect, or any favored standing in the
law.  And after all, people are not drawn to the &quot;gay&quot;
life because of an overpowering interest in raising children.
The question of marriage for gays or lesbians, or rights of adoption
for gay couples, take on their importance strategically:  They
provide further occasions for moving the law to pronounce that
homosexuality is, in the current phrase, &quot;virtually normal,&quot;
that homosexuality cannot stand on any lesser plane of legitimacy
than that sexuality &quot;imprinted in our natures.&quot;

<p>

But it is worth reminding the press, and the public, as to what provided
the urgency, for the Congress, to come forth at this moment, with
the Defense of Marriage Act.  The litigation in Hawaii was percolating
for a few years, but matters moved into an alarming phase with
the argument before the Supreme Court, last October, in <i>Romer
v. Evans</i>.

<p>

When I testified before the Judiciary Committee of the
House on May 15, the decision in that case was expected any day.
It arrived five days later, on May 20th, and it was quite as
bad as many of us had anticipated.  In that decision, the Court
struck down a constitutional amendment in Colorado that refused
to treat gays and lesbians as a protected or favored class, on
the same plane as the groups that suffer discrimination based
on race or gender.  We will hear, of course, different accounts
of that case, but in my own reading, that decision will be read
by many activists among the judges to produce this lesson:  that
a State may not incorporate in its laws or public policy an adverse
judgment on homosexuality, and it may not refuse to accord to
homosexuality the same standing or legitimacy that attaches to
that sexuality &quot;imprinted in our natures.&quot;  With this
move, the Court may have armed federal judges to tie up any legislation
in a State that refused to honor homosexual marriages:  After
all, the argument might run, the State refuses to credit this
marriage only because of the gender, or the &quot;sexual orientation,&quot;
of the couple.  Would this not be, on the face, but another 
&quot;discrimination&quot; against people because they happen to be 
gays or lesbians?

<p>

As it turned out, we did not have long to wait.  This argument has
already been sounded by Professor William Eskridge of the Georgetown
University Law School (in the June 17 issue of <i>The New Republic</i>).
Several weeks ago, I taped a television program on this subject
with Professor Eskridge, who affected not to be aware then of
any such development that could undercut the authority of the
States in refusing to honor gay marriage.  In the hearings, Congressman
Frank was especially contemptuous of this bill on the ground that
it was an unnecessary extension of federal power -- that Congress
would act here to confirm to the States a power they already had.
When I pointed out the implications of the coming decision in
<i>Romer v. Evans</i>, there was no acknowledgement on the part of Frank
that he was aware of the case pending there. In a piece in <i>The
New York Times</i>, Professor Laurence Tribe affected the same want
of awareness.  Tribe joined Frank in arguing that the bill was
unjustified precisely because it was unnecessary -- that the States
would not require any prop to their authority in rejecting gay
marriage.  But now Professor Eskridge seems to have let the truth
slip.  He has made it clear that gay activists would indeed read
the Romer case in the way I've suggested, and that they can of
course be expected to cite it -- as they would cite anything else
even remotely supportive of their arguments -- as they seek to
challenge in the courts the Defense of Marriage Act.

<p>

And yet, this Act is the most delicate and limited measure that the 
Congress could produce on the subject.  It treats subjects that are 
evidently within the reach of the Congress, and it makes the least 
intrusion into the domain of State law.  What other institution could 
possibly have the authority to clarify the meaning of terms in federal
legislation, if not the federal legislature?  It surely cannot
be a novelty to make explicit what has ever been our tradition,
that marriage &quot;means only a legal union between one man and
one woman as husband and wife.&quot;  In the second sentence of
the Full Faith and Credit Clause the Constitution reads:  &quot;And
the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which
such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect
thereof.&quot;  Once again, we may ask:  If Congress may not legislate
under this federal clause, what other institution could possibly
claim the authority to legislate?  How could we legislate in any
more minimal way here than in the way the Congress has chosen
to legislate -- namely, by providing merely that no State would
be obliged to honor, as a marriage, anything but what we have
known traditionally as &quot;marriage,&quot; the legal union of
a man and a woman, as husband and wife?  As I say, it is hard
to imagine any law on the subject that moves with more delicacy
or with less intrusion into the powers of the States.  The States
that wish to honor gay marriage will suffer no restriction in
this measure.  But on other hand, this provision on the part of
Congress may supply the only ground of support for a State in
refusing to credit same-sex marriage, especially if a federal
court moves to strip from a State every other source of resistance.

<p>

In my own testimony last May, I anticipated that questions would
be raised about the power of Congress to legislate on the subject
of marriage through the Full Faith and Credit Clause.  That clause
was obviously not meant as a grant of power to Congress to legislate
more broadly on the subject of marriage, and that is the not the
power that the Congress is undertaking in this case.  I pointed
to some of the earlier flexing of congressional authority under
the Full Faith and Credit Clause, in dealing with the custody
of children and the protection of former spouses from threats
of violence.  The Clause had been used, in other words, to deal
with some of the fallout from divorce and the rupture of families,
in matters that ran beyond the powers of the States.  The same
situation would present itself here.

<p>

I suggested in my testimony
that an even more dramatic instance of the problem was supplied
in 1803, when Congress barred the shipment of slaves into any
state that itself prohibited the import of slaves.  The problem
did not arise for States in the North where slavery was prohibited,
for there was no point in shipping slaves into those States. 
The problem arose for States in the South, where slavery was protected
under the law, but where there was an effort to ban the import
of more slaves.  Under the Constitution, of course, a State could
not cast up barriers to trade across the boundaries of the States.
Only Congress had the power to regulate interstate commerce,
and so the power of Congress was called in here as an annex to
the policy of the State in forbidding the import of new slaves.
Yet, under the Constitution, Congress could exert no authority
over the import of slaves from abroad until 1808.  And it was
widely assumed that Congress had no authority to legislate directly
on slavery within the States.  Clearly, Congress was not thought
to possess the authority to legislate on the substance of slavery
within the States; it could deal only with the problem of fugitive
slaves, moving from one State to another.  But just as clearly,
Congress alone could close off the borders of a State to slaves
shipped from other States, and that authority had to be the source
then of this interstitial power to legislate on the substance
of slavery.

<p>

It seems to me that no more or less has been claimed
in this case, with the Defense of Marriage Act.  There is no way
to avoid touching upon the substance of marriage, and yet the
legislation bears all the marks of an effort simply to touch this
matter in the most minimal way.  It is evident that the drafters
assert no authority here to legislate more fully on the subject
of marriage.  The purpose, plain to any onlooker, was to make
the least intrusion into the powers of the States.

<p>

In contrast, there have been rather emphatic intimations, in other 
parts of our law, that the federal government could indeed reach far 
more widely in the domain of marriage and the family.  Chief Justice
Marshall once remarked in passing, in the Dartmouth College case
(1819) that an apt question might arise under the Contract Clause
if a State passed an act, say, &quot;annulling all marriage contracts,
or allowing either party to annul it without the consent of the
other.&quot; [<i>Dartmouth College v. Woodward</i>, 17 U.S. (4 Wheaton)
518, at 629]  When the federal courts strike down arrangements,
in the States, to assign custody to children on the basis of race,
they engage the Constitution in this matter, and with the effect
of remodelling, in substance, the laws of custody in the States.
[<i>Palmore v. Sidotti</i>, 466 U.S. 429 (1984)]  With this act in Defense
of Marriage, the Congress uses but the slightest portion of the
authority it might it claim to act in this field.  And again,
that deliberate confining of its reach must be taken as a measure
of the intent of the drafters to move with the lightest hand,
in touching nothing more than Congress needs to touch.

<p>

But as restrained, and as limited, as the reach of Congress is in this 
case, this move on the part of Congress is quite telling.  In fact, the 
studied silences in this bill, the simplicity and spareness of its moves,
serve to convey even more powerfully its significance as a legislative
act.  For it represents nothing less than a willingness of Congress
to take up again its warrant to act as an interpreter of the Constitution,
along with the courts and the Executive.  Against the concert
of  judges, remodelling on their own the laws on marriage and
the family, the Congress weighs in to supply another understanding,
and a rival doctrine.  But it happens, at the same time, to be
an ancient understanding and a traditional doctrine.  The Congress
would proclaim it again now, and suggest that the courts take
their bearings anew from this doctrine, stated anew, brought back
and affirmed by officers elected by the people.

<p>

This effort on the part of Congress to weigh in, to participate again 
in the interpretation of the Constitution, was made more urgent by the
prospect of <i>Romer v. Evans</i>, and now it has been made ever more
urgent by the advent, by the presence, of that decision in <i>Romer
v. Evans</i>. The problem of gay marriage was not the only problem
deepened by the judgment in <i>Romer</i>, and if the Congress can counter
the courts on the question of gay marriage, it would be quite
as urgent for the Congress to take this first step, to begin acting
again, for the sake of inducing the courts to limit or narrow
the holding in <i>Romer</i>.

<p>

Here we offer no arrant speculation, but
we simply follow the precise warnings cast up by Justice Scalia
in his dissenting opinion, as he began to draw out for the public
the implications of this recent decision.  As Scalia pointed out,
the Association of American Law Schools now requires all of its
members to extract this pledge from law firms that are interviewing
candidates:  that the employer will be willing to hire homosexuals.
At the same time, the Supreme Court has now declared that people
who hold to the traditional Jewish and Christian teaching on sexuality
are fueled by an irrational &quot;animus.&quot;

<p>

As far as I know, no Moral Court has managed yet to refute the traditional
Jewish and Christian teaching on this ancient problem, and yet
the Court has now pronounced that teaching to be vacuous, to be
connected to no plausible or defensible purpose.  As Scalia has
observed, the Court now declares serious Jews and Christians to
be nothing less than bigots.  And so, as we put these strands
together, is there not an incentive now, for law firms, to gauge
whether the senior partners or young associates harbor views that
may put the firm at odds with the regulations of the law schools?
While affecting no prejudice, mind you, toward people who are
serious about their religion, the law firms may nevertheless screen
out people who acknowledge their seriousness as Christians and
Jews.

<p>

The incentives will not emanate simply from the conventions
of the law schoools.  After all, if the Supreme Court itself has
now declared that a moral objection to homosexuality is indefensible,
irrational, the distillation of unreasoned prejudice or &quot;animus,&quot;
does the Court not in fact install the predicate for grievances
and litigation?  If a young, gay associate is denied standing
as a partner, could it not be claimed that the climate in the
firm was poisoned at the outset, or set in a discriminatory cast,
by the presence of senior partners who bore moral reservations
about homosexuality?  What can be said in this respect for law
firms could be said even more forcefully about the colleges and
universities.  Given the litigious experience these days in the
academy, we can virtually <b>count</b> on the fact that grievances will
be filed.  What if a member of an academic department has simply
done what I have done -- given public testimony, or published
articles, staking out a position or defending a moral judgment
on gay marriage?  Might that supply a <i>prima facie</i> ground for a
grievance later?  Might it not be argued--and will it not be argued
-- that the situation was at least biased, or tilted, at the outset
by the presence of that member of the Faculty?  Can we expect
then certain pressures, subtle and unsubtle, to separate those
members of the faculty from the decisions on tenure -- or hiring.
And might it finally be best to remove the problem at the root
simply by avoiding the hiring of people who bear these religious
and moral sentiments, which the Supreme Court has now declared
to be prejudicial and irrational, without any redeeming features?

<p>

In sum, the Court has fashioned, in <i>Romer v. Evans</i>, a powerful
new instrument.  That decision provides now a &quot;clean&quot;
device for blocking from the academy, and the professions, people
who are &quot;overly religious,&quot; overly serious about their
Christianity or Judaism, which is to say, people who take seriously
the traditional moral teachings of Christianity and Judaism.

<p>

The uses of this decision are portentous in their possibilities
-- which is why it is so critical that Congress takes the first
step in forcing the question.  For in acting, the Congress sharpens
the question for the Clinton administration.  Mr. Clinton has
already indicated that he will sign the Defense of Marriage Act
-- something, presumably, he would not do if he thought there
was anything unconstitutional in this measure.  But at the same
time, his spokesman has announced that the administration welcomed
the decision in <i>Romer v. Evans</i> as quite appropriate or justified.

<p>

In that event, the administration will be pressed to settle
the jural mind of Mr. Clinton:  Would the administration agree
with Prof. Eskridge and the people who would extract the broader
principle from <i>Romer</i> and use it to challenge the constitutionality
of the Defense of Marriage Act?  If so, then presumably President
Clinton would veto this act as unconstitutional.  But if the President
is still inclined to sign the act, if he is inclined then to defend
its constitutionality, then his administration would be obliged
to show just where the gay activists are wrong.  They could help
to establish then just how the decision in <i>Romer</i> could be narrowed
and limited.  If the administration could do that, it would be
rendering, almost in spite of itself, a public service.  And if
the Congress induced the administration to perform that service,
then this Defense of Marriage Act will produce a good that moves
well beyond the question of marriage in the laws.

<p>

But I would return, in closing, to the problem I mentioned at the 
beginning of these remarks, the problem posed by Congressman Frank. I 
said that the sky would not fall in, there may be no signs of deterioriation
in the neighborhood, as a consequence of recognizing a gay marriage,
but that kind of evidence was rather beside the point.  We were
dealing here with certain questions of principle, and with harms
that may not be measured with immediate, material injuries.  Those
questions involved the grounds of principle that underly the laws
on marriage, and the ground on which we favor that structure of
commitment and lawfulness as the framework for begetting and nurturing
children.  Some of us drew attention to the problem of polygamy
as a place where those questions of principle may be sharply focussed.
But it also suggests the kinds of changes that may make a profound
difference for the character and fabric of our lives if the laws
of marriage begin to come apart.  During the hearings, Congressman
Frank's inclination was to treat these arguments with derision
and scoffing.  He was not aware of any national movement pressing
for the return of polygamy.  Mr. Ed Fallon, a legislator from
Iowa, had testified at the hearings in favor of gay marriage,
and when the problem of polygamy was posed to him by Congressman
Sensenbrenner, he remarked that polygamy simply &quot;wasn't a
big issue&quot; in his State.

<p>

But as I said, we had been raising
questions of principle, not making predictions about a new trend
toward polygamy.  Yet, the people who were inclined to dismiss
the matter so lightly were treating, with a certain nonchalance,
something that deserved to be treated with far more caution and
sobriety.  For as it happens, polygamy has persisted, in isolated
pockets in our own country, even in our own day.  For many years,
there have been centers of polygamy in southern Utah and northern
Arizona, which have proven intractable.  There were outbreaks
of violence in the late 70s, throughout the 80s, and on into the
90s, as the authorities carried out raids in an effort to repress
the practice.  Mr. Ed Fallon remarked, with offhandedness, that
polygamy just doesn't happen to be a big issue back in Iowa.
But it seems to have eluded this earnest man that polygamy doesn't
happen to be an issue in his State precisely because the law,
for many years, has cast up serious barriers to polygamy.  The
federal government once had to send troops into Utah as part of
the scheme to repress the practice.  If those barriers started
coming down, do we really think that our species is incapable
of manifesting an interest in that arrangement once again?

<p>

When the proponents of gay marriage show a flippant disregard then
for polygamy, they show not only a want of historical memory,
but a dimness of moral imagination. It does not apparently enter
their reckoning of the world that political movements are often
stirred on and channeled by &quot;principles.&quot;

<p>

Nor do they readily see that the argument for gay marriage would sweep 
away the impediments of the law that impede, among other things, the
interest in polygamy.  These innocent people, who casually dismiss
these prospects out of hand, are part of that tribe described
by Aristotle in the <i>Ethics</i>: Their defect of understanding &quot;is
not due to a lack of years but living the kind of life which is
a succession of unrelated emotional experiences.&quot;  As the
principles they are planting now work themselves out, and the
results kick in, these people, in their childish candor, will
be the first to record their surprise.  And to tell us, earnestly,
that they never expected things to go this far.

<title>CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</title>

<h2>CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY<br>
DEVELOPMENT</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by<br>
Dr. John M. Perkins</i></center>

<p>

<i>The following speech was presented at the Family Research Council's
&quot;World Without Welfare&quot; symposium on December 13, 1995
at the Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C.</i>

<p>

Wayne Gordon and I are going across America in something that
we are calling the American Cities Campaign.  We are taking into
cities across the country the concepts of neighborhood and community
development that have emerged from the church.  I am the chairman
of the Christian Community Development Association, and Wayne
Gordon is the president.  He has spent 20 years in Chicago developing
ministries there.  His great ministry has been building up Lawndale
Community, one of the 15 poorest neighborhoods in America.  Because
of efforts by people like Wayne Gordon, young, indigenous people
-- predominantly black -- are going off to colleges and universities
and returning to their home communities to provide new leadership
for a new generation.

<p>

<center><h3>SUGGESTED RESOURCES</h3></center>

<p>

Wayne Gordon has described his effort in a book called <I>Real
Hope in Chicago</I>.

<p>

The book that best summarizes the philosophy that I will share
with you today, however, is a book called <I>Beyond Charity</I>.
This book outlines how we have been working for the last 35 years
in neighborhood and community development.  And a new textbook
for community development today has just been published under
the title <I>Restoring At-Risk Communities</I>.  I edited the
book, but it was written by practitioners -- people who are a
part of the Christian Community Development Association (CCDA).

<p>

The Christian Community Development Association is made up of
about 4,000 individuals and about 400 organizations.  The purpose
is really not something from the top down; it's something from
the bottom up.  It belongs to the people, one of the things that
motivated me to come here today.  I don't really believe that
major organizations, whether they're government organizations
or national organizations, can implement indigenous leadership and 
produce the kind of motivation and incentive that people need at the 
bottom.

<p>

We do need organizations that affirm the dignity of the people.
The rationale for a national organization ought to be to inspire
those people to take responsibility for their own lives.  Then
we can come along beside them to help them realize their hopes,
goals, and aspirations.  I think you have heard today that our
big federal government is taking that incentive away.  I think
that's what's motivating the movement for welfare reform.  You
can't isolate crime and violence and all these other problems
from the fact that well-intended people are doing things without
believing in the inherent dignity of the individuals being helped.

<p>

The programs that work are those programs in which the initiative
starts first with the people themselves.  Alcoholics Anonymous
is working.  It is working because the individual says &quot;the
problem is mine&quot; and decides to take responsibility for himself.
Then other people come along beside him and help.  Our work should
be to bring about that kind of motivation, incentive, creativity
and the hope that people can do for themselves what they need
to do.  Our newest book, <I>Restoring At-Risk Communities,</I> outlines
strategies for success.

<p>

The last book I want to mention specifically is <I>Resurrecting
Hope</I>.  We have looked at 12 churches in America that have
taken the principles that I am talking about in terms of community
development and have put those principles to work at the grass-roots
level.  There's a West Los Angeles church, for example, that is
the largest black worshipping congregation in the United States.
I worked with that church, and they are in the book.  There is
also Redeemer Presbyterian Church in New York City, along with
10 other congregations that are doing successful community development
work.

<p>

Finally, we have created <I>Urban Family</I> magazine because
we were concerned about the philosophy of the liberal establishment.
I am not stating that fact to pit liberals against conservatives.
I object to liberalism simply because the system created by the
liberal establishment has made black people think of ourselves
as helpless victims who cannot do much for ourselves -- despite
the fact that people like Booker T. Washington and others came
out of slavery and developed the great institutions of our day.

<p>

We now have all the resources, but we act like victims because
the government has come in and taken the responsibility away from
people.  We fault racism and everything else for all of our problems,
and we never play to our advantages.  And so we created a magazine
called <I>Urban Family</I>. It looks at people in the community
who have taken the initiative and are doing things very creatively,
and it encourages blacks to begin building on our strengths instead
of just compounding our weaknesses and always acting like victims.

<p>

There is no other national Christian magazine that is written
from a black perspective in America.  The voices and the aspirations
of black folks themselves are not being heard -- we hear only
the liberal-victimization type of mentality that is being spoken
for us by somebody else in society.  And so this magazine is published
from the urban community, by people within the urban community.

<p>

The last publication that I want to mention is our newest magazine,
called <I>Reconciliation</I>.  Of course, one of our operating
assumptions -- even as we talk today about the church taking responsibility
for the problem -- is that the church itself has a major problem.
The problem is that the church has lost its central message of
the Gospel, which is the love of God <I>demonstrated</I>.  The
purpose of the Gospel is to reconcile alienated humanity to a
holy God and to each other across racial, social, and economic
barriers.

<p>

But instead we have created a church that perpetuates those barriers,
and that's the reason that all our social action has not yet prevailed
against racial division. The church is essentially operating as
a black church or a white church or a Chinese church -- which,
again, is a major heresy because the very idea of the Gospel was
to reconcile those people together in one body and the world would
know that we were Christians because of our love one for another.
If we take all the money from the federal government and somehow
shift all responsibilities to the local church, we still would
not have solved our problem.  We still would not be able to communicate
the central message of the Gospel -- that the world will know
we are Christians by our love.

<p>

<center><h3>PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATION</h3></center>

<p>

So let me just share with you a little bit about the philosophy
on which our ministry is based.  Our ministry is based on the
fact that we are created in the very image of God.   This must
be the first effort of Christians -- to establish that all people
are created in the image of God, that all people therefore have
dignity, and that our dealings with each other should reflect
that sense of divinely-endowed dignity.  But how do we affirm
the dignity of individuals?  If we affirm the dignity of people,
then we can create the motivation and incentive for their own
development in society.  So how do you do that?  How do you meet
people where they live?

<p>

You must meet people at their basic need as they perceive it.
That's why uniform government programs organized in Washington
by task forces and imposed on people down at the community level
are going to further cripple people because top-down programs
do not represent their greatest aspirations.  We need to start
with the deepest felt needs of people.  Then we need to love those
people around those needs as they perceive them before we try
to change them.  Our loving them, in other words, is the change
agent.  We cannot change anyone before we choose to love him as
he is.

<p>

If you affirm dignity by meeting people at their deepest felt
needs, then we can motivate them.  That's why Jesus became bread
to people who were hungry.  That's why He became water to people
who were thirsty.  He met people at their basic need.  He loved
them around that need, and you can't do that from afar.  The felt-need
concept, then, is the basic philosophy that grounds community
development.  We are not necessarily accepting wrong behavior.
Instead, we are accepting that behavior as an expression of their
need at the time and then loving them until we can motivate them
to see that they have a deeper need that will require a change
in their lives.

<p>

How do you implement that change?  Let's look at the three basic
human needs that people have in society.

<p>

<center><h3>THREE BASIC HUMAN NEEDS</h3></center>

<p>

The most basic need that people have is the need to be loved and
nurtured.  We know that fact by observing broken families that
are lacking in love and nurture.  If you ask most people who study
urban crime, they will tell you that the vast majority of juvenile
delinquents come from a home without a father -- without that
early childhood nurture.

<p>

The second need that people have is the need to know that they
are significant.  Human beings are not &quot;niggers,&quot; 
&quot;honkies,&quot; and &quot;gooks.&quot;  Human beings were created in 
the image of God and have absolute dignity.  That dignity needs to be 
expressed in their own creativity.  Their own creativity is work.  Work
is absolutely crucial to the reflection of God's image.  God worked,
and He created us to express His dignity by our own creativity
and our own work.

<p>

The third need is the need for a reasonable amount of security.
Everybody has that basic need.  The most crucial problem in our
society is not simply the breakdown of the family, although that
in itself is a reflection of the problem.   The great problem
we have in our society is the breakdown of the community itself.
Families break down from time to time.  But when the community
breaks down, then the society falls apart.  Most social or government
action doesn't really get at the crux of the problem because it
is dealing with symptoms of the problem.  In reality, it takes
the village to raise the child and so we need to re-fix the village.
Mankind was created to live together in a neighborhood, the perfect
village.  So how do you tend to the village?  How do you develop
the community?

<p>

When I arrived in Mississippi, I realized that our education and
social welfare system did not affirm dignity.  Education merely
transported young folks out of the village, leaving the community
poorer and poorer as they went away.  The greatest problem we
have today is that people with the skills remove themselves from
the places of need -- and in their absence, we send in our welfare
system to make the needy dependent.  People need our presence
in the neighborhood with them.  They need our inspiration.

<p>

I can see that in Mendenhall.  I remember saying to my wife Vera
Mae 30 years ago, &quot;We're going to make a difference in this
little village of Mendenhall, this little poverty village.  What
we have to do is stay in this little village long enough so that
we can win some of these young people to Jesus Christ.  We have
to be able to nurture them in their faith.  We have to help them
get a love for God, a love for themselves and a love for the community.
That's a greater love than consumerism and materialism.  Then
we will help them to go off to college and to secure an education
with a purpose.  We will teach them to get the education and then
return with their new-found knowledge to help develop the resources
of the community.&quot;

<p>

I stayed in that community 12 years.  It happened.  I left there
and went to Jackson, and I stayed in that community for 10 years.
It happened there, too.   And then I went to California and stayed
in a neighborhood for 13 years.  My own children there have developed
a school in that community to carry on and to educate those children
within that neighborhood.  So, it is possible.  But our concept
of development must be &quot;indigenous.&quot;  First, we must
plant ourselves within the community.  The reason Wayne Gordon
has succeeded in Chicago is that he moved into that neighborhood
20 years ago and has lived there, inspiring people day by day.

<p>

<center><h3>THREE &quot;R'S&quot;</h3></center>

<p>

So the first &quot;R&quot; in development is <I>relocation</I>,
living in the community with the people.  The people in the community
must be able to take responsibility for their own lives.  Outside
people must come in if necessary to live among them and to inspire
individuals to take responsibility for their own lives.   Then,
those individuals in turn will have the joy of developing their
own neighborhood in their own community.  This approach to redevelopment
will take a generation to accomplish.  But you must live in the
neighborhood.  You can do some hopeful, nice things; but if you
are not living in the neighborhood, you may be convincing the
poor that they do not have worth.  You may be creating more violence
within them and giving them false hope.

<p>

The second &quot;R&quot; of development is <I>reconciliation</I>.
If the church does not believe in that, our country will be hopelessly
divided.  The new leader in the black community is a black Muslim
who does not believe that the Gospel is to reconcile people together.
The rise of Islam will aggravate racial tensions -- unless the
white congregation recalls to its senses the fact that the purpose
of the Gospel is to reconcile man to God and man to man.

<p>

The third &quot;R&quot; of development is something I call 
<I>redistribution</I>. By the word &quot;redistribution,&quot; I don't 
mean taking all the money from the rich and giving it to the poor because 
that would only mean that we have deified money.  Deifying money is
a basic problem in our society and a central problem of government.
Even a tax credit for charitable contributions runs the risk
of deifying money.  Remember that tax money didn't originally
belong to the government.  It originally belonged to the people,
and it is the responsibility of the government to manage those
resources for the greater good of society.  The first need that
people have is not money, but incentive.  They need the incentive
of community before they get money.  They need motivation.  They
need education.  They need skills, and all of these are more important
than money.

<p>

If the churches become contractors for the government, moreover,
this will be a disaster for our nation at the most fundamental
level.  I do believe that the church can inspire economic and
all other kinds of development at the grass-roots.  But if you
have churches competing for government money -- and every day
in the newspapers there is another church that, like government
poverty programs, has used the money poorly -- we will have destroyed
the last life we have within the urban community and the last
healing program we have.

<p>

Those programs that are really healing in the community are not
those that are funded by the government.  Those programs that
are really healing people are ones that have taken the initiative
and have been able to put together the private resources to do
the kind of work that the Christian Community Development Association
encompasses.

<p>

On the other hand, I would be in favor of programs like vouchers
for schools or other services.  At least the vouchers would be
based more on production and creative competition -- unlike block
grants, where the resources would be quickly wasted and swallowed.
The public schools are too big and the classrooms are too clumsy
to give nurture or cultivate Christian values at the community
level.  And in our community, we must have the motivating force
of faith.

<p>

Faith-based discussions build on the dignity and the historical
behavior of black people in our society.  The discussion of faith
must take place -- or else, we are destined still to be driven
by racism and bigotry.  And our people will still suffer.

<title>Classical Education</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">
<h2>CLASSICAL EDUCATION</h2>
<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by<br>
Fritz Hinrichs
<p>
This text is adapted from a speech given by Fritz Hinrichs
at the 1995 Homeschool Curriculum fair in San Diego, Calif.</i></center>
<p>
This talk will address two questions: what is Classical Education
and why is it necessary in our day.
<p>
The word &quot;classical&quot; or &quot;classic&quot; is used
in many contexts and often without specific meaning: Classic Coke,
classical music, classic rock.  However, classical usually means
something that through time has proven worthy of our respect and
interest.  In music, the work of certain composers has been recognized
as worth saving, while that of others, though popular in its own
time, has been tossed aside into the dust-bin of history.  The
same is true of books.  Some books are more worthy of study than
others because of the profundity and clarity with which they express
the ideas they contain.
<p>
The study of the great books has been the backbone of good education
for centuries.  If you look at the books read by the intellectual
giants in our culture, you find that particular books come up
again and again.  These books were required of most schoolboys
until the rise of Dewey and the democratization of education through
the public school system in the first half of the 20th century.
 The public school system saw these books as elitist and not easily
comprehensible by the masses and, therefore, not appropriate for
public education.
<p>
Another influence contributing to the demise of the great books
was the demoralization of the Christian intellectual community.
 Most of the institutions of learning in this country were founded
by Christians who saw it as their duty to conquer the intellectual
arena for Christ.  However, since the rise of secularism and,
especially, since the humiliating defeat that biblical Christians
suffered at the Scopes Trial, the evangelical community has been
in full retreat from the intellectual arena.  Before the turn
of the century, most institutions of learning were dominated by
those who thought from a Biblical worldview.  This consensus,
however, soon began to crumble.  In the 1925 Scopes Trial, the
public humiliation of William Jennings Bryan's creationism caused
academia, as well as the general culture, to hold biblical Christianity
as unworthy of intellectual regard.  Even though the trial was
in no way a rigorous debate of the creation issue, its effect
on the Christian intellectual community was nothing 
short of disastrous.  From that point on, Christians felt as though
the intellectual elite had humiliated them, and, in return, they
abandoned the intellectual community in droves.  The intellectual
pursuit came to be seen as not only of little value for Christians,
but also as simply antagonistic to the faith.  At this point in
history the church saw an unraveling of the Christian intellectual
tradition.  No longer would Christians apply themselves to the
study of the great thinkers; that would be a task left entirely
to those with a non-Christian world view.
<p>
Christian education has become something of a lost science.  Not
only have Christians done very little to prepare their children
to become godly intellects, but intellectual incompetence has
been seen as the true helpmate of vital spirituality.  A soft
mind has been considered a vital tool in the pursuit of a soft
heart.  In our day, mental rigor and a vigorous intellectual pursuit
are often equated with doctrinal rigidity and cold spirituality.
<p>
However, by God's grace, with the increasing interest in classical
education, we are seeing a revival of the Christian intellectual
tradition.  Classical education differs from most educational
philosophies in that it attempts to step back from the parade
of pedagogical fads that seem to keep us in a state of continual
bewilderment and asks:  &quot;What was education like in the past?
 What books were used?  What goals were thought important?&quot;
<p>
Dorothy Sayers, in her well-known essay &quot;The Lost Tools of
Learning,&quot; attempted to answer these questions and, in so
doing, gave us some very sage advice for education in our own
day.  She began by investigating the medieval model of education
and found that it was composed of two parts.  The first was called
the Trivium and the second, the Quadrivium.
<p>
The Trivium contains three areas:  Grammar, Dialectic, and Rhetoric.
 Each of these three areas suits to a specific stage of a child's
mental development.   During his early years, a child studies
the Grammar portion of the Trivium.  The Grammar period (ages
9-11) is based on memorization and the acquisition of foundational
facts.  During their younger years, children possess a great natural
ability to memorize large amounts of material even though they
may not understand its significance.  This is the time to fill
them full of facts:  multiplication tables, geography, dates,
events, plant and animal classifications-- anything that lends
itself to easy repetition and assimilation by the mind.  The Grammar
stage lends itself to the study of language, especially an ancient
language such as Latin or Greek, which requires much memorization
of grammatical structures.
<p>
During the second period, the Dialectic (ages 12-14), the child's
greater reasoning ability prompts him to ask questions based on
the information gathered in the Grammar stage.  The child no longer
sees the facts he has learned as merely separate pieces of information.
 Through questioning, he begins to develop logical relationships
between facts.  The American Revolution is no longer a mere fact
in history; it must be understood in light of the child's whole
scope of knowledge.  For example, how are the actions of the American
revolutionaries to be understood in relation to our responsibility
to obey the governing authorities?  How can the fact that Washington
and Jefferson are both held up as great men be reconciled with
the fact that they were slave-holders?
<p>
When a child comes to the age of ability to reason, he frequently
uses his reason to make a nuisance of himself by back-talking
to his parents or trying to catch them in some error or fallacy.
 This sometimes irritating new ability of the young mind should
be directed towards profitable mental exercises.  The study of
formal logic can aid greatly because it teaches the student the
rules that guide sound thinking.  Many subject areas provide good
practice material for the young mind.  Historical events often
pose questions of morality requiring a good deal of discussion
and careful reasoning.  Theology also gives many opportunities
for debate.  Though our discussion must be seasoned with reverence
for the subject matter as well as for our opponents, fundamentally
we can see theological debate as a very healthy and beneficial
activity.  A less controversial but equally powerful tool for
cultivating logic is the study of mathematics.  For thousands
of years the geometry text written by the ancient Greek mathematician
Euclid has provided a beautifully constructed series of geometrical
proofs that, with guidance, any perceptive child can work through
with great benefit to his or her thinking skills.
<p>
The third period Dorothy Sayers mentions is that of Rhetoric (ages
14-16).  At this age, the child moves from merely grasping the
logical sequence of arguments to learning how to present them
in a persuasive, aesthetically pleasing form.  Sayers also calls
this the Poetic age, because expression becomes as important as
logical content.  During this period the student can begin to
study areas of interest in greater depth in preparation for the
Quadrivium, in which students specialize in particular areas of
study.  In the Rhetoric period, students more inclined towards
either mathematics and science or literature and the humanities
can pursue the area of their natural abilities.  The pursuit of
particular subjects is appropriate at this stage because a student
who had been given a classical education would have the thinking
skills and mental discipline and other tools of learning necessary
to tackle the difficulties associated with almost any area of
study.
<p>
In modern education, we have put the proverbial cart before the
horse by expecting students to master a great number of subjects
before they have mastered the tools of learning.  Even though
the study of language and logic may seem dull in themselves, they
equip a student with the tools needed for mastering any particular
subject, whether it be Scottish political history or carburetor
maintenance.  As Sayers states in the conclusion of her essay,
&quot;The sole true end of education is simply this:  to teach
men how to learn for themselves; and whatever instruction fails
to do this is effort spent in vain.&quot;
<p>
&quot;Learning to learn for oneself&quot; certainly well summarizes
the pedagogical goal of classical education; however, once equipped
with the ability to learn, where shall one go from there?  Another
truism is helpful here:  &quot;Education is merely selling someone
on books.&quot;  To be able to learn for yourself does not mean
that you no longer need a teacher, but rather that you are capable
of making books your teachers without the aid of an instructor
to explain the books to you.  In our day and age we seem to be
quite impressed by the number of years one has spent in the academic
institutions obtaining degrees.  The ancients, however, would
probably have thought our institutions must be quite poor since
they rarely produce students who are able to learn independently.
 That a student still needs an instructor to explain the works
he is reading shows a sad level of intellectual dependency.  We
seem to think that intellectual adolescence must be indefinitely
prolonged before granting a young scholar the right to stand on
his own two feet.  The fact that you leave the academic institution
should not be a sign that your education has come to an end, rather
it should show that you are ready for it to begin.
<p>
If we ask, &quot;Which books are worthy teachers?&quot;,  the
answer usually depends on what we are attempting to learn.  If,
however, the question is, &quot;Which are the truly great books?&quot;,
we find there is actually fairly broad agreement.  There are books
that through history have shown enduring value.  With the Bible
we have a canon comprised of those books that God, through his
Spirit, has directed the Church to acknowledge as authoritative;
so also with the great books there is a canon of sorts.  Through
time certain books have generally come to be viewed as central
to the development of western culture and have had an unusually
large impact due to the profundity and eloquence with which they
have expressed their ideas.  These books form the core of the
western intellectual tradition; it is the ideas contained in them
that have formed the saga known as western history.
<p>
Anyone who has grown up in the West and desires to understand
the cultural milieu in which they have been raised should read
these books.  In order to come to a self-conscious understanding
of the ideas that have shaped the culture around us, we need to
face the ideas at the source from which they came.  Francis Schaeffer
had an excellent sense for the top-down flow of ideas.  He was
fond of explaining  how ideas began with the philosophers, worked
down through the universities, into the popular media and finally
into the general culture.  Because ideas progress in this manner,
it behooves us to become acquainted with ideas at their fount
so that we may understand their manifestations in our present
culture.  Thus, the reading of the great books serves an important
apologetic function for Christians.
<p>
When I describe the study of the great books as a tool in apologetics,
people often visualize their study as something of a brutal secular
gauntlet the Christian must run in order to gain intellectual
credibility.  This is a mistaken understanding.  Certainly there
is much in the western intellectual tradition that must be consciously
rejected and put under biblical criticism, but it is the non-believer
and not the Christian who must fear the reading of the great books.
 Those who through the promotion of political correctness would
return us to polytheistic paganism have come to realize that they
must entirely throw out the study of western culture if they are
going to reshape the thinking of our students.  Western thought
has been permeated with Christian monotheism and, thus, a persistent
concept of objective and universal truth, so it will always be
dangerous territory for the mental slugs that political correctness
would raise up on its diet of insipid relativism. 
<p>
Certainly the study of the great books should not be taken lightly.
 There are serious hazards to one's faith that lurk, but studying
through the great books often is like the trouble-filled journey
of Christian in <I>Pilgrim's Progress</I>.  Just about the time
that you think all is lost and that the darkness is certainly
coming in around and you feel that you will surely be done in,
an author who is a friend of the Faith comes to your side and
helps guide you back to the path of truth.  For every Aristotle,
there is an Augustine; when you are in the throes of a skeptical
Descartes, the brilliant faith of Pascal comes to your aid; when
under attack by Hume, you have a friend in Calvin; when besieged
by Kant, you fight back with Lewis.  God in his providential care
has given us a bountiful number of voices who have stood in the
gap at crucial periods of our history and spoken for His truth.
 The men God has raised up to speak His truth to our culture are
a testimony to the tremendous care with which He has guided the
West.
<p>
We live in the continuum of western history.  In order to evaluate
this stream of which we are a part, we must step back from it
and discern the ideas that have shaped it.  To attempt to ignore
the ideas that have shaped our cultural history is to guarantee
ourselves not only cultural irrelevance but also entrenchment
in the Christian ghetto.  This position not only will lead to
our own intellectual poverty but also will disgrace the Sovereign
God who needs not be mocked by the cowardice of His children.
 The King's children do not hide in the alleys but walk confidently
knowing that the sun that shines belongs to their Father.

<h2>KIDS HOPE USA:<br>
A VISION FOR<br>
CHURCHES AND CHILDREN</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by<br>
Dr. Virgil Gulker</i></center>

<p>

<i>The following speech was presented at the Family Research Council's
&quot;World Without Welfare&quot; symposium, held at the Willard
Hotel in Washington, D.C. on Dec. 13, 1995.</i>

<p>

My wife overheard someone recently call me an expert on the care
and nurture of children.  She was quite amused by that comment.
She simply smiled and walked away, and we haven't talked about
it since.

<p>

If your wife is like my wife, she remembers those times when we
have done anything but illustrate expertise in parenting.  I recall
the time, for example, when I disciplined my 4-year-old, and,
following the discipline, realized that I had made a mistake.
I had disciplined her for something that I had misinterpreted.
So I got down on my knees and put my hands on her little shoulders
and said, &quot;Emily, Daddy was wrong.  Will you forgive Daddy?&quot;
And Emily looked me in the eye and said, &quot;Sure, Daddy. I
forgive you lots.&quot;  I think all of you can relate to that
at some level.

<p>

I have two passions.  One is children and the other is the church,
the body of Christ.  I've listened today.  I've heard about so
many church-based organizations, but I haven't heard much about
the church itself.  My passion is the church.  I look at the 350,000
religious congregations in this country -- with an average membership
of roughly 100 people per congregation -- and I think of what
those 35 million Christians could accomplish.  The potential is
awesome.  We have five times more churches than post offices and
35 times more churches than McDonald's restaurants.

<p>

The church is clearly the most sustainable local organization,
yet I hear so little about the role the church and its members
can play in this process of reaching, reconciling and healing
lives.  The experience of an organization I founded called Love,
Inc. says very clearly that there are Christians in every community
who are prepared to help, to give hope, to share love if 
they are approached -- if they have the appropriate training --
and if they are affirmed for that relationship.  What I learned
with Love, Inc., through the 300,000 volunteers, was that we don't
need heroes.  We need very simple, very basic people.  People
like me and like many of you who are prepared to come alongside
someone who needs principally love, nurture, and affirmation.

<p>

I was challenged two years ago by an organization called International
Aid to put my passions to work.  They said, &quot;Virg, can you
create a model that will somehow engage church members themselves
in the lives of the most at-risk children and families?&quot;
I spent a year researching that.  Instead of promoting answers,
I asked questions.  I went to people who were involved with health
services and human services, education, religion, government services,
and professional volunteer services.  I asked them three questions,
and the answers to those questions forever transformed my approach
to ministry.

<p>

<center><h3>THREE QUESTIONS TO THE HELPING COMMUNITY:</h3></center>

<p>

The first question was: <i>&quot;What are the needs faced by
our children and families?&quot;</i>

<p>

We all read these things in the newspaper, but I wanted to know
how the experts would define the need.  What I heard absolutely
broke my heart.  If you can look into some of the faces of these
children experiencing the pain and despair that is a part of their
lives and <I>not</I> cry, you have a problem.  I came to the conclusion
that America either does not care for its children or does not
know how to care.  How else can you explain the fact that more
children in this country will be pregnant, murdered, drug-dependent,
incarcerated, or poor than the children of any other industrialized
country?  How else can you explain the fact that 0-3-year-old
children are now some of the most neglected children in the entire
world?  One out of every four of our children lives in poverty.
Thirty-one percent live in fatherless homes.  The litany of woe
goes on and on.

<p>

Then I wanted to find out, <i>&quot;Why so much need?&quot;</i>

<p>

I went into my own community and discovered to my dismay that
in Holland, Michigan, an idyllic place along the Lake Michigan
shoreline, with literally a church on every corner and an unemployment
rate of  3 percent, we have had a youth violence increase of 400
percent over the last five years.  Four hundred percent!  That
exceeds the national average by 300 percent.  &quot;Why?&quot;
I asked.  &quot;Why are so many of these young people engaging
in personally and socially destructive behaviors?&quot;  Every
expert said to me, &quot;It's because these young people and children
are desperate for affirmation and for value. Someone needs to
say to them, 'You have value.  You have purpose.  You have meaning
in this community.  Your life has meaning.'&quot;

<p>

Children are looking in all the wrong places for affirmation.
Affirmation is the key need for all of us, and we will find it
-- if not in appropriate ways, then we will find it in <I>in</I>appropriate
ways.  More and more young people are turning toward gangs, for
example.  Michigan has 83 counties, and we have organized gang
activity now in 44 of the 83 counties.

<p>

A 15-year-old boy in my community joined one of four major gangs,
two of which came out of Los Angeles.  The ceremony was as brief
as it was brutal.  They said to him, &quot;Armando, all you have
to do is stand here and take our beating for two minutes without
resisting.&quot;  All the men wore steel-toed boots.  For two
minutes they brutalized this kid.  Absolutely brutalized him.
At the end of two minutes, he was required to stand up, embrace
each man, and call him brother.  Then he was allowed as a reward
to participate in front of all the men in sex with a girl who
had also become part of the gang.  The initiation ceremony for
girls, as some of you know, is much, much worse.

<p>

The next day someone went to him and said, &quot;Armando, why?
Why would you allow yourself to go through that?&quot;  His answer
was immediate.  He said, &quot;I knew this was going to hurt really
bad, but I felt that if I could take it for just a couple of minutes,
I'd be surrounded by people who loved me.&quot;  That's the name
of the game, friends.

<p>

My second-grade daughter (two years ago) was asked to join a gang
by a little girl whose principal characteristic was her body odor.
She would crawl under the teacher's desk periodically and moan,
&quot;No one loves me.  No one loves me.  No one loves me.&quot;
Children would not stand in line with her.  They would point
at her and laugh.  Finally, she also began to move toward gang
activity.  Second grade!  She wanted my daughter to go along with
her.  But my daughter did a revolutionary thing.  Instead of reporting
her to the teacher, she began to pray for her and said to me,
&quot;Daddy, I'm going to be her friend.&quot;  My daughter became
her friend.

<p>

Other teenagers, young people, are turning to pregnancy.  Talk
to anyone working with pregnant girls.  Ask them why these girls
are pregnant.  Sex has nothing to do with it.  These girls in
most cases are so desperate for someone to love and value them,
for someone to hold them, for someone to be intimate for 20 minutes,
that they will endure anything, including pregnancy.  It's a desperate
situation out there.

<p>

Others who do not find affirmation turn to suicide.  Our suicide
rate for young people is up three times -- a three-time increase
in 10 years.  One of the second-graders we had hoped to place
in a loving relationship through Kids Hope is no longer eligible
for our program.  He tried to kill himself and was institutionalized.
I was horrified.  I went to the school and I said, &quot;You're
going to have to help me understand this.  I have a second-grade
daughter.  How does a second-grader arrive at trying to kill himself?&quot;
The teacher said, very simply, &quot;These children, whose lives
are so desperate and without hope, conclude that death is safer
than life.  So they choose death.&quot;  It's happening more and
more.

<p>

Experts told me that we can expect to lose a generation of children.
This will be the first time we have lost a generation in this
country without a war.

<p>

My next question for them was: <i>&quot;What should the church
do?  Do you see a role for the church?&quot;</i>

<p>

Almost to a person they gave me the same answer.  &quot;Virg,&quot;
they said, &quot;it's really not very complex.  Tell the church
to mobilize its members to form one-to-one relationships with
the youngest children.  Tell them to go in to the elementary schools
and work with children who are at that critical age when values
are formed, self-esteem is developed, and critical academic and
problem-solving skills must be acquired.  Virg, tell them to do
that.&quot;

<p>

The mayor of my city when asked what we should do about the violence
in our city said, &quot;We don't need any more programs.&quot;
Michigan, as you may know, has 40,000 non-profit organizations,
not counting churches.  We don't need any more programs.  We need
more caring adults to put an arm around a troubled child and say,
&quot;I love you.  I love you, Judy, Tom, Mary, Sammy, Armando.
I love you.&quot;

<p>

Ron Vogel, former national director of the WIC program, met with
me once to talk about church involvement.  I said, &quot;What
do you think, Ron?  Can a church play a role in meeting the needs
of the WIC mothers and their children?&quot;  He said, &quot;Tell
you what.  I can give the churches a strategy that they can use
to single-handedly reduce the incidence of infant mortality, low
birth weight and long-term dependence on the public health system.&quot;
I said, &quot;Ron, let's do it.  How much will it cost?&quot;
And he said, &quot;Nothing.  All I want the church to do is to
mobilize its mothers and its grandmothers to form one-to-one relationships
with pregnant young women.  Talk to the young women about breast-feeding
and get them to the clinic on time.  If they do only that, they
will transform a generation of young, black women.&quot;

<p>

Anacostia, in southeast Washington, at that point had the highest
infant mortality rate in the country.  At precisely the same time
I heard that statistic, an African-American young woman who worked
in a local ministry came to me and said, &quot;We don't know what
to do.  We have African-American grandmothers who are complaining
to their pastors and others that they no longer have any value
in their church or their community.&quot;  This is all about people.
We have to reestablish the people issue.  It's not about welfare
reform.  That can be a very nice intellectual dodge, but the reality
is that we're talking about people with resources and people in
pain.

<p>

Sometimes people who are very cynical say to me, &quot;Virg, do
you really think that God is in our world?&quot;  I say, &quot;Absolutely.
I can take you right to where He is.&quot;  They say, &quot;Well,
where would I go?&quot;  And I say, &quot;At the intersection
of a caring Christian and a child or any other person in need.
That's where my God lives.&quot;  He's out there right now. 
People in urban ministry encounter God countless times every day
and every month and every year.  That's the potential.

<p>

I recently asked someone who works with troubled children in my
area what kind of children he wants Kids Hope to love.  I expected
a wonderfully learned and long-winded answer.  He surprised me.
He said, &quot;Virg, focus on the children who need hugs.&quot;
I've been thinking about that now for about six months.  I like
what that says about the potential of the body of Christ.  What
if the local body of Christ were known as that distinctive organization
within the community that formed relationships with kids and families
and hugged them?

<p>

<center><h3>FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS TO THE CHURCH:</h3></center>

<p>

I asked the experts one last question: <i>&quot;Will the church
do that?&quot;</i>

<p>

Without any hesitation, almost everyone said the same thing: 
&quot;No way.  We know we can count on the church for commodities,
for holiday food baskets, for food pantries, for clothing closets,
for a ride to the doctor, for Vacation Bible School, and for all
that is wonderful and necessary in many cases.  We have found
to our dismay, however, that we cannot rely upon the church for
relationships.  We've had to turn elsewhere for relationships.&quot;

<p>

I didn't want to believe that because I have worked with church
volunteer programs for 20 years.  I went out and began to survey
pastors -- determined to prove these people wrong because I believe
that relationships are at the heart of our Gospel.  Without relationships,
there is no reconciliation.  I'm not sure there is redemption.
So I surveyed pastors from churches ranging in size from 50 members
to 6,000 members.

<p>

I asked one question:  <I>&quot;How many of your members are engaged
in one-to-one relationships with at-risk elementary school children
in the neighborhood of your church?&quot;</I>  Out of a combined
membership of 30,000, I found fewer than 20.

<p>

My follow-up question was: <i>&quot;How many of your families
are in relationships with some of the families of the children?&quot;</i>
The answer was fewer than 10.

<p>

That doesn't make sense to me.  Seventy-nine percent of all church
growth is attributed to a person, a friend or a relative, telling
someone about Jesus Christ.  We're investing all kinds of money
in programs and agencies.  Only 10 percent of Americans now have
any sort of significant relationship with a non-believer.  Eighty
percent of all people who accept Jesus Christ do so by age 18,
yet every church I visited was dedicating the vast majority of
its outreach and evangelism money to programs touching people
20 years old and older.  It's a wonderful strategy to fail, and
sadly, it's not reaching these hurting children and their families.

<p>

Do Christians care?  Absolutely.  I get letters and phone calls
virtually every day and have for 20 years.  When we were establishing
Love, Inc., I had calls from every state.  Then we began to get
calls and letters from other countries.  Every request sounded
the same.  People said,  &quot;We want to share the love of Christ
with the poor and we don't know how to do it and our church doesn't
know how to help us.  Can you get something started here?&quot;
There are so many people who care.

<p>

Recently, I went into a large church and I said to them, &quot;Your
church is going into the neighborhood school in eight months to
work with at-risk elementary school children.  Next Sunday, I'm
going to walk from this church to that school.  I invite you to
go with me one mile.&quot;  I had a feeling that my wife, my two
daughters and I would have a very leisurely stroll.  God surprised
me.  I showed up at the church the next Sunday, and 250 men, women
and children were standing there.

<p>

We walked a mile to the school, and then we held hands as we circled
the school.  Forget church-state.  We simply held hands.  We prayed
for those children.  We prayed asking God to bless our commitment
to transform and love those children.

<p>

I still have people coming up to me saying, &quot;Virg, what we
needed was a symbol.&quot;  Bob Woodson has said very appropriately
that conservatives, Christians and Republicans -- not necessarily
in that order -- are much less adept than liberals and Democrats
at using symbols.  I'm finding that so many people want to rally
around this vision of helping and loving a child -- especially
when given a symbol.

<p>

The key problem I found in churches is not a lack of compassion.
As I inquired into the organizational structure, every church
I worked with had the same problem.  They lacked any sort of system
or infrastructure for the recruitment, training, supervision and
affirmation of volunteers. It's like a small business trying to
operate without a personnel department.  Most of these churches
could characterize their ministry by saying, &quot;We pay, we
pray, and we give stuff away.  We do wonderful, wonderful things,
but we never change any lives or any situations.&quot;

<p>

Our call at Kids Hope is to go into one church at a time and to
create that infrastructure within each individual church so that
they can engage their members in the lives of other children.
My past work has all been devoted to community agencies.  I would
go into communities and set up agencies to draw together the resources
of hundreds of churches.  I've changed.  I found that, when many
churches are involved in a project, every church owns it and no
church owns it.  The director of the church-based organization
will spend 70 percent of his or her time raising money, 10 percent
managing public relations, and the rest just feeling generally
frustrated.

<p>

The church is the one most sustainable local organization.  If
we can give them an infrastructure, a personnel department designed
to link their members with children and families in the neighborhood,
we can change the lives of the church members and the lives of
those people needing help.  The church simply giving out food,
money or clothing is not going to make it.  That's the same kind
of commodity distribution that the welfare system has tried for
so long, and it has not worked.

<p>

We are the body of Christ.  We have the most awesome potential,
not just to share Christ but to share that transforming, reconciling
message that can change and empower lives.  That's what we can
do.  If we have 35 million Christians in this country, I contend
that we need to apply the Gideon principle to them.  Remember
when Gideon fought the Midianites?  He started with a ridiculously
small army of 32,000.  God stripped His army until He was left
with less than 1 percent.

<p>

If we look at 1 percent of the existing church membership, we're
looking at 350,000 people.  If each of those people gives a dollar
a week for a year, that will amount to $18,200,000.  If each volunteers
an hour a week, valued at $10 per hour, that labor will be worth
$182,000,000.  That remnant alone can contribute $200,200,000
to transforming outreach.  We must not demean the potential of
the body of Christ -- the very means, the arms and the legs that
He has given us to reach out.

<p>

Let me conclude by sharing the metaphor that has really guided
my ministry.  Because I'm about children and the church, this
really struck me.  A number of years ago, during the Vietnam conflict,
a number of Vietnam veterans were shipped to a hospital in San
Diego.  What they shared in common was that they had lost all
of their arms and legs.  They were lying with simply their heads
and torsos on beds.  They had fallen into such a profound depression
that they simply could not speak.  They were hiding within themselves.
The registered nurse on the floor tried everything to get them
out of their depression, but she failed.

<p>

Finally, in creative frustration, she called the other nurses
together and said, &quot;Gather up all of the terminally-ill babies
in the hospital and strap them face down to the torsos of these
veterans.&quot;  As she left the room, she said to the veterans,
&quot;Gentlemen, these babies are dying.  Most have no visits.
No one to love them.  There is no one to bond with them, and
you have nothing to do.  Your job is to love these babies.&quot;

<p>

The nurses left the room.  They did this day after day.  And in
less than one week, all of the Vietnam veterans had escaped their
depression and were orchestrating the care of the babies.  Each
man fought it, but every time he opened his eyes the eyes of a
little baby were penetrating his soul, looking for that heart
of compassion that had to be in there.

<p>

Those terminally-ill babies, I think, are the children and the
families in our society.  We're losing them.  We are losing a
generation of children.  The veterans, I believe, are the body
of Christ, if it refuses to minister in the name of Christ.  If
it refuses to be the arms and legs of the church, the church and
Christ Himself will be powerless.

<p>

But the church could also be the nurses.  God calls us to be that
creative force, calling the culture -- not just to an awareness
of the need -- but to a realization of what the Christian community
can do in responding to that need.  Our task is, not simply to
hold that baby up in the maternity ward to show people how cute
it is, but rather to hold the baby up and to suggest specific
strategies that the church, the body of Christ, can use in reaching
out to children.  We must love them, touch them, put an arm around
those babies as they grow older and say, &quot;I love you.  Jesus
Christ loves you, and that will make all the difference in your
world and mine.&quot;

<p>

One of our dear volunteers has shown the humor of God.  This woman
is one of the wealthiest women I have ever met.  She works with
Kids Hope through her church.  She has been assigned to a child
from one of the poorest families in her county.  She noticed that
Billy needed shoes, badly.  The teacher said, &quot;Don't buy
them.  It will cause a major disruption in the family.&quot;

<p>

The volunteer came to me and said, &quot;Virg, it's killing me.
I need to buy Billy a pair of shoes, but they won't let me.&quot;
This woman could buy Billy a shoe store if she wanted to.

<p>

I said to her, &quot;What did the teacher ask you to do?  Did
she ask you to buy shoes?&quot;  She answered, &quot;No.  She
said, 'Minnie, could you love this boy?  Could you help this boy
understand how important he is?'  So that's what I've been doing.&quot;

<p>

I talked to Minnie the next week and I said, &quot;How's that
coming, that love business?&quot;  She said, &quot;It's incredible.
I came into school last week and Billy was on the other side
of the school, at the other end of the hallway, and he saw me.
He opened his arms and he began to run down the hallway shouting
at the top of his lungs, 'Mrs. Matthews!  Mrs. Matthews!  Mrs.
Matthews!'  Then he came next to me and scooped me up in a hug.&quot;

<p>

This is a first-grade boy.  He didn't need shoes nearly as badly
as he needed love.  The church has always been there to give Billy
shoes.  The Billy's in our world now need above all else to be
loved and valued.

<p>

No agency -- public, private or para-church -- can do that because
their role is to respond to need.  The role of the church is to
respond to people.  We can do it.  We have the answer to this
problem.  We can create an army to attack these child and family
problems, but we need the people and they need the vision of a
healing and loving God.  Thank you.

<title>RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION AROUND THE WORLD</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">

<h2>RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION<br>
AROUND THE WORLD</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<h4>Testimony of Martin J. Dannenfelser, Jr.<br>
Assistant to the President for Government Relations<br>
Family Research Council<br>
before the House Committee on International Relations<br>
Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights<br>
February 15, 1996</h4></center>

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, I would like to express the apology
of our president, Gary Bauer, for being unable to testify. He
did intend to be here. He wanted to thank you for your leadership
on this issue and to express that apology.

<p>

Mr. Chairman, it is truly ironic that some of the world's biggest
problems fail to attract the notice they deserve. That is the
message we get on the global problem of anti-Christian persecution.
That persecution is growing, both in frequency and in cruelty.
We are appalled at the lack of concern and public attention being
paid to the hidden horror of anti-Christian persecution.

<p>

This persecution takes many forms. Under predominantly Islamic
and former Communist governments, Bibles and religious services
are being banned, missionaries and converts are being imprisoned,
and in Ethiopia believers are actually being crucified. One of
our staff members, Rosanne Dupras, was a volunteer worker overseas
for seven years and has traveled extensively throughout Asia.
She has witnessed the persecution of individuals because of their
religious faith. For example, India is hailed as the world's largest
democracy, with a population of almost 1 billion people. Eighty-five
percent are Hindu, 12 percent Muslim, and 1-2 percent are Christian.
Although the national government describes itself as a secular
democracy with freedom of religion for all -- the government has
taken a less-than-tangible approach to the outcries of persecution.

<p>

Miss Dupras recalls how Sunil, a native of India and a Christian,
was jailed, harassed, stripped naked and interrogated for an endless
number of hours. The compound where he lived was vandalized. He
was slandered and vilified in the local press by persecutors who
included police officials, government intelligence agents, as
well as radical Hindu fundamentalists. The state government participated
in and initiated many of the attacks -- the federal government simply 
turned a blind eye. Atrocities like this occur frequently in 
nation-states that give lip-service to freedom of religion while 
persecuting any deviance from their own ideology of religion.

<p>

Allow me to clarify that this persecution extends beyond Christianity
to include other faiths, although persecution of Christians seems
to be the most widespread. In Ayodhya, Miss Dupras reports that
Hindu groups slaughtered Muslims as the police watched and in
Bombay the police themselves were the ones who massacred Muslims.
A young Muslim Bengali woman in Bangladesh had to flee for her
life after writing a book which was sympathetic to Hindus rather
than to Muslims. She is still hiding somewhere in the West.

<p>

So far, the U.S. Government has largely turned a deaf ear to this
rising tide of terrorism and these human rights violations. Saudi
Arabia, our recent ally in the Gulf War, has pressured the U.S.
on two fronts. The first was to close a U.S.-sponsored nightclub
frequented by American servicemen in Saudi Arabia. Our government
said &quot;No way!&quot; to closing it. The Saudis also demanded
that we stop Sunday worship services at our embassy. To this,
we buckled under. In Turkey, the U.S. has turned a blind eye as
Turkish officials forcibly returned Christian refugees to the
clutches of Iran.

<p>

On January 15, 1996, <I>The Wall Street Journal</I> reported,
&quot;China's religious authorities ordered all places of worship
to register with the government in what may be the beginning of
a new crackdown on religion.&quot;[1] A Mona Charen column elaborated:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

. . . persecution is commonplace in China, where only a fraction
of the estimated 30 million to 70 million Christians belong to
government-approved sects. Amnesty International reports cases
of Christian women hung by their thumbs from wires and beaten
with heavy rods, denied food and water, and shocked with electric
probes.[2]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

Ms. Charen's column described the following abuses under Sudan's
Islamic government:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

many of the black Sudanese in the southern part of the country
(the north is Arab) have resisted conversion, in many cases because
of adherence to Christianity . . . As punishment, the Sudanese
government has denied food and medicine to Christians in famine
areas and has sold thousands of Christian children -- some as
young as 6 -- into slavery.[3]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

Tolerating episodes such as these conflicts not only with the
inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness
in our own Declaration of Independence but even those basic human
rights universally accepted. These rights include, under the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights: the right to life, liberty and security
of person (Article 3); freedom from slavery or servitude in all
their forms (Article 4); freedom from torture or cruel, inhuman
or degrading treatment or punishment (Article 5); equal protection
of the law without any discrimination (Article 7); the right to
freedom of thought, conscience and religion; freedom to change
his religion or belief and to manifest his religion or belief
in teaching, practice, worship and observance (Article 18); freedom
of opinion and expression (Article 19); and the freedom of peaceful
assembly and association without compulsion to belong to a particular
association (Article 20). Christian persecution is a gross violation
of human rights.

<p>

In the United States, an historical example of our defense of
religious minority rights abroad is the 1974 Jackson-Vanik amendment,
which made Jewish emigration a condition for aid to the Soviet
Union.[4] Title 22 of the United States Code Service contains the
following passage:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

The Congress declares that the individual liberties, economic
prosperity, and security of the people of the United States are
best sustained and enhanced in a community of nations which respect
individual civil and economic rights and freedoms... Furthermore,
the Congress reaffirms the traditional humanitarian ideals of
the American people...[5]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

The U.S. development cooperation policy emphasizes the encouragement
of development processes in which individual civil and economic
rights are respected and enhanced as one of its four principal
goals. It insists that the &quot;. . . pursuit of these goals
requires that development concerns be fully reflected in United
States foreign policy.&quot;[6] Our policy toward humanitarian violations
is quite clear, and the real tragedy here is the appalling lack
of concern here at home and the lack of action by the administration.

<p>

It's time to end the silence of our President and his administration.
President Clinton must waste no time in addressing the American
people, issuing demarches to offending nations, initiating letters
to Heads of State, and working with the State Department desk
officers in the offending nations. The President's focus should
begin with the most egregious violators such as China, Ethiopia,
and the Sudan. Hopefully, other countries will begin to change
their policies when they see the tangible consequences of their
inhumane actions.

<p>

As a candidate for president in 1992, Bill Clinton criticized
former President George Bush for &quot;coddling dictators&quot;
in his policy toward China. Ironically, it is the Clinton administration
that has now totally decoupled the issues of human rights and
Most Favored Nation (MFN) trade status for China. This action
sends a signal that the U.S. Government is prepared to do nothing
more than pay lip service to China's human rights abuses, which
include persecution of Christians, forced abortion, and slave
labor. We call on President Clinton to heed his own advice and
stop coddling persecutors of Christians. The time has come for
rhetoric to be joined with actions and results.

<p>

It's time to end the silence of Congress in decrying these outrageous
violations of freedom of speech. This kind of brutality compels
Congress to action: &quot;Dear Colleague&quot; letters, House
Resolutions, floor speeches, and necessary adjustment in our foreign
economic policy. I strongly suggest an expanded bipartisan coalition
to establish a checklist of conditions required for economic aid
with a commitment to inquire, track, reprimand, and call for sanctions
against violators. Consistent action is demanded in order to stop
the <I>de facto</I> tolerance of such grievous offenses.

<p>

It's also time to end the silence of the citizens and churches
of America. The Family Research Council is committed to doing
our part in educating citizens and churches, and encouraging their
involvement and participation. America as a whole can no longer
remain silent.

<p>

America has an obligation and responsibility to speak out against
manifestations of tyranny and oppression. Indeed, it was our forefathers
who fled to this country for freedom of religion, speech, and
expression. These are values that unite this country, and we should
defend them. The <I>Department of State Bulletin</I> from December,
1984 put it succinctly: &quot;the moral bases of democracy --
the principles of individual rights, freedom of thought and expression,
freedom of religion -- are powerful barriers against those who
seek to impose their will, their ideologies, or other religious
beliefs by force.&quot;[7] If we fail to speak out forthrightly in
defense of the freedoms endowed by our Creator, we will undermine
our nation and the principles it is built upon. It is a central
element of our national heritage to stand up and, as documented
again in a September 1989 <I>Department of State Bulletin,</I>
&quot;stress the protection of freedom of thought, conscience
and religion, and of freedom of opinion and expression; for without
these freedoms, other rights cannot be fully realized.&quot;[8]

<p>

Some argue that they cannot speak up, because it will only tempt
the tyrants to greater cruelty. But history teaches the opposite
lesson. Speaking fearlessly is the only thing that deters tyrants.
The time has come for Americans to demand that our government
act now to stop this unconscionable persecution. Clearly, the
pro-family and religious communities need to be full partners
in the quest to bring an end to the horror of religious persecution.
Failure to do all within our power will sear at our collective
consciences as we hear the anguished voices of our brothers and
sisters overseas who cry out, &quot;Why have you forsaken us?&quot;

<title>DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT: HOW ADOPTION POLICY IS AFFECTED</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">

<h2>DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT:<br>
HOW ADOPTION POLICY IS<br>
AFFECTED</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by<br>
Mary Beth Style, M.S.W.</i></center>

<p>

<i>This speech was presented at a July 2, 1996 Capitol Hill briefing
regarding the Defense of Marriage Act.  The briefing was sponsored
by the Family Research Council.</i>

<p>

Whenever there is a discussion of adoption it is generally useful
to remind the audience of the purpose of adoption.  In the United
States, adoption has traditionally been an institution to create
families for children when their biological families could not
or would not raise them.  The law has been very careful to ensure
that adoptive families are treated the same, for all intents and
purposes, as families who gave birth to their children.  In addition,
the law also requires that the child be at the center of all adoption
policy and practice.  Unfortunately, in recent years, some who
have attempted to reform adoption laws and policies are not addressing
the needs of children, but instead are promoting the cause of
adults.  Discussions about &quot;right to adopt&quot; are clearly
not child-centered, but adult-driven.

<p>

Adoption law varies substantially from state to state in matters
relative to time frames for taking consents or overturning adoption
decrees.  But the states are unanimous on one point:  an adoption
cannot be granted  by a judge unless it is proven to be in the
best interest of the child.  While there may be a difference of
opinion about what is in the best interest of a particular child,
the law is clear that it is the child that matters, not the adults.

<p>

Except for a very few exceptions, adoption law and policy has
attempted to stay away from categorizing who can and cannot adopt.
The exceptions generally would be limited to prohibiting persons
with a history of abuse or crime from adopting.  In addition,
Florida and New Hampshire prohibited by statute homosexuals from
adopting.  In virtually every other state, until recently, the
law has allowed only married couples or a single individual to
adopt.  The reason  for this policy, which I believe is sound,
is that the state believed that adults should make a legal commitment
to each other before making the commitment to a child to ensure stability
for the child.  A true family, which adoption is intended to create,
cannot exist if the only legal relationship between the parties
exists through the child only.

<p>

While it is true that this policy has prevented two homosexuals
from adopting a child, it also has prevented unmarried heterosexuals.
There have been exceptions to the rule as individual courts have
allowed adoptions by unrelated adults to proceed.  One of the
more celebrated cases is the Woody Allen/Mia Farrow adoptions.
Obviously, if states begin to recognize marriage between homosexuals,
it will likely become easier for two homosexuals to adopt a child
because they will be meeting the marriage requirement.

<p>

However, while it is true that a judge must give final approval
to an adoption once he or she determines it to be in the best
interest of the child, the real decision making generally occurs
at an earlier point by the individual or agency making the placement.
While few of us would want social service agencies to arbitrarily
prevent appropriate people from being able to adopt, I do believe
that we must be very careful about suggesting that any individuals
or groups should have the right to adopt.

<p>

There is no &quot;right&quot; to adopt and to create one would
be contrary to the best interests of children because instead
of finding the most appropriate family for a child, the state
and its agents would have to ensure that adults are allowed to
adopt a child.  Since a &quot;right&quot; is a guarantee, the
state would be required to &quot;guarantee&quot; a child for adoption.
The absurdity of that position is obvious.  Yet, I am troubled
by discussions in recent years by some who are promoting &quot;gay
rights&quot; who are proposing that there ought to be a right
to adopt.

<p>

Instead, decisions about children should be made based on an individual
child's needs, taking into account any existing relationships
the child may have.  We have a growing body of evidence which
shows the damage done to children who are raised without fathers.
Much of that research emphasizes the differences in parenting
styles between mothers and fathers and shows that each is important
for the healthy development of children.  It is clear that it
is not an issue of quantity when it comes to parenting.  A child
who is raised by his mother and grandmother, may have tow parents
for all intents and purposes to share the load, but the absence
of a father is still very apparent in his development.

<p>

There is no denying that many children raised by single parents
and children raise by homosexuals are doing very well.  But the
child who is raised by a mother and a father has an easier time
of it and has the opportunity to experience and model the behaviors
of both sexes.

<p>

In adoption, it has traditionally been the responsibility of the
field and the state to stack the deck in favor of the child. 
Many policies appear to be unfair to adults, but again adoption
is not about  adults.  For example, many individuals balk at the
notion that adopting parents should be in good health arguing
that many individuals who give birth have chronic health conditions
or that none of us knows when we might be hit by a car.

<p>

While both of those arguments are valid, it is the obligation
of the social worker or agency to weigh the odds in favor of the
child.  It is more likely that healthy parents will be around
to see a child grow to maturity than a parent with a serious medical
condition.  So, too, policies which give preference to married
heterosexuals stack the deck in favor of the child.  While it
may be true that in certain cases, where an individual has a relationship
with a particular child or has a special gift to match the special
needs of a particular child, it is in the best interest of a child
to be adopted by a single person, whether heterosexual or homosexual.

<p>

But, if we truly are looking at the best interest of the and not
concerned about the appearance of being tolerant of adults, we
will select whenever possible, a mother and a father for child.
Kids do not care about being politically correct.  They just
want a mommy and a daddy.

<p>
We have in our office &quot;Goals 1996.&quot;  We're moving a little bit
more quickly than Goals 2000.  Our goals for 1996 include the
dis-establishment of the U.S. Department of Education, to undo
what President Carter did back in 1979.  He created the department
to meet a commitment that he made to the National Education Association.
 We opposed the creation of a Department of Education in 1979,
and we've seen nothing in the last 16 years to justify its continued
existence. Our sincere belief is that the appropriate federal
role in education is no federal role in education.  Our Constitution
does not call upon our federal government to be running schools
from Washington, D.C.  We will very energetically support other
leaders in Washington trying to dis-establish the U.S. Department
of Education.  The key point is that $70 billion of our money
goes into Washington, D.C. to be spent on education, money we
think can be better spent by states and communities and localities
and, most importantly, by parents and taxpayers themselves.  Our
emphasis is going to be on local schools and local leaders.
<p>
We're also going to call for the repeal of Goals 2000 legislation which
was passed last year.  Now, Goals 2000 is one of the most important
education bills ever in this respect:  it is, in effect, the nationalization
of American public education, bringing more power and authority
into Washington, D.C.  It's very interesting that this happened
because, at the same time, the United States considered a health
care plan which was devised by Ira Magaziner and Mrs. Clinton,
a health care plan which would have centralized authority and
power and eliminated choices.  The American people and their Congress
rightly considered and, we believe, rightly rejected that idea.
  But that's because there was a serious national debate, and
we actually looked into the plan and carefully analyzed it.  Americans
understood what they were being offered and said, &quot;No, we
don't want it.&quot;
<p>
Unfortunately, we did not get the same quality
of debate and discussion about Goals 2000 that we did about the
Clinton health care plan.  Interestingly, Ira Magaziner and Hillary
Clinton played a part in devising the Goals 2000 plan over the
last half decade or more as well.  But we're not here to represent
one political party or another, and we have to be fair because
President Bush actually introduced America 2000 back in 1991.
 His Secretary of Education, Lamar Alexander, supported America
2000.  Now we think Goals 2000 is even worse than America 2000.
 But the principle had given way, and too much control was already
coming to Washington in America 2000.
<p>
It made it very difficult to leverage opposition to Goals 2000 in Washington
when a lot of the Republican members on Capitol Hill said, &quot;How
can we vote against Goals 2000?  Didn't we endorse pretty much
the same thing just a year or so ago?&quot;
<p>
We said, &quot;Yes, regrettably you did, and we were trying to talk to you about 
that, but we didn't get anyone's attention.&quot;
<p>
So now we are working on the repeal of Goals 2000.  Let me draw from my Coast 
Guard days to create a metaphor.  If you look at the Elementary and
Secondary Education Act, it's a huge liner. It's an $11.6 billion
piece of legislation, another bill to extend power and authority
over our communities.  Most states cannot say no to their share
of $11.6 billion.  If you look at Goals 2000, it doesn't look
that big.  It's only $700 million.  I realize I'm working in Washington
where you talk about a billion here, a billion there -- pretty
soon you're talking about money.   But if you think of Goals 2000
as a small tugboat guiding and pushing that huge liner, you'll
get an idea as to why Goals 2000 is so vital.  It's not that big
money is involved, but it's the power and direction that the program
gives.
<p>
One of the reasons I especially wanted to come speak to
you is to express our deep gratitude and appreciation to you as
homeschoolers for what you have done to help transform the picture
in Washington.  I'm talking about what happened last year with
H.R. 6, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, that was going
through the House of Representatives.  When you were threatened
with something called the Miller Amendment, which had the potential
almost to outlaw private education, religious schools and homeschools
in the effect that it would have had down the line, you created
a sensation in Washington, D.C.  A sensation, I should mention,
that has never really been noticed by the Washington Post, the
New York Times, Dan Rather or Connie Chung.  Maybe we'll just
try to get Gary to whisper it to Connie Chung....
<p>
It was a major event to be there at ground zero, with hundreds of thousands
of phone calls coming in from all over America about H.R. 6. 
Not every member of Congress had been following H.R. 6 with rapt
attention.  Many of them were interested in the agriculture bill,
the trade bill, or NAFTA, or military issues or foreign trade
-- all these other things -- and they weren't too concerned about
what was going on in a committee about education.  But all of
a sudden their phones lit up.  They couldn't make any phone calls
in or out, their faxes were completely tied up, and they were
finally saying, &quot;What are they talking about?  Who are they?&quot;
 Well, there's a sign chiseled in the House of Representatives,
right over one of the passages, that says, &quot;Here, sir, the
people rule.&quot;  They are the people, sir.   That's who's calling
you.  That's where you're getting your phone calls from.  We recognize
and honor the role of leaders, leaders like Carol Lee Adams, the
homeschooling mother in New Jersey who actually brought this whole
thing to our attention.  She immediately contacted Michael Farris,
us, and a committee staff on Capitol Hill.  We certainly honor
leaders like Dr. Dobson and Gary Bauer, but none of this could
have happened if you just had a group of leaders calling each
other and expressing their indignation.  None of this earthquake
could have occurred unless there was this coast-to-coast, popular
uprising against this very dangerous bill.  So that's why I wanted
to come and thank the earthquake for what happened there.
<p>
What happened on Capitol Hill reminds me of the parable in the Gospel
of Luke of the widow and the unjust judge.  &quot;And for a while,
[the judge] was unwilling.  But afterward he said to himself,
even though I do not fear God nor respect man, yet because this
widow bothers me, I will give her legal protection, lest by her
continually coming she wear me out.&quot;   I like that, but,
of course, in Washington, not everyone likes you to cite Scripture.
 So I would recommend to those believers in the gospel of Charles
Darwin that you ought to at least recognize that you don't come
between a she-bear and her cubs.  That is a very dangerous thing
to do.
<p>
The lesson to draw from this blitz over H.R. 6 is the
need for accurate and timely communication.  We are moving very
quickly with fax networks, telephone trees, with newsletters,
with radio broadcasts, and even on the Internet.  We have the
ability to communicate with one another quickly and accurately
to check information.  That is a major step forward that is going
to be used by the pro-family movement generally, and especially
by homeschoolers.  I think it also proves to us that, in our time,
decentralization of power is a reality.  We do not believe that
Washington, D.C. has all the answers to all the problems in our
lives.  And decentralization of information is making possible
a revitalization of local democracy.  So decentralization works.
<p>
I think it also proves to us that Americans are capable.  For
a long time now we have proceeded on the idea that Americans don't
know how to run their own affairs.  With all of these legislative
measures that have come through, be it the health care plan, be
it the education plan, even in many ways in the crime bill, it
was assumed that we had to go to Washington with our hats in hands
saying, &quot;Please, our rulers, will you govern us?  Will you
somehow free us from our local problems?&quot;  The  H.R. 6 battle
proved that Americans are capable.
<p>
The homeschooling movement is much more than this remarkable episode over H.R. 6. 
I honor the commitment that homeschoolers make, and I have found some
things about the movement that I think are important to all Americans.
<p>
I know one of the first questions that you are all asked is,
&quot;How will your children be socialized if they are homsechooled?&quot;
 That has been one of the major concerns of American public education.
 I have always thought that you may fail there -- you may not
actually meet the national standards in <i>socialization</i> of kids
-- but your children will instead be <i>civilized</i> and that wouldn't
be bad at all.
<p>
You have also taught a lesson in democracy to
the entire country.  We have two drop-out problems in our country.
  One is the school drop-out rate.  But I'd say there's another
drop-out problem that gets less attention, and that's the drop-out
of citizens.  In this great free republic of ours in 1994, only
39% of eligible Americans voted in the Congressional elections.
 These were perhaps the most important Congressional elections
in a generation, yet only 39% voted.  That, by the way, was a
very good turn-out for an off-year election, the best in over
20 years.  But nonetheless, it suggested six out of 10 Americans
did not even exercise the right to vote which was bought with
blood for them.  That's not America the way it ought to be.  
We need to have more citizens engaged.  Homeschoolers are teaching
a lesson in citizen involvement that I think is very important,
and that is gaining respect, even from some people who are not
otherwise sympathetic.  William Raspberry, a leading columnist
in Washington, D.C., is generally liberal and many times writes
columns that I do not agree with.  But William Raspberry has been
kindly disposed toward homeschoolers.
<p>
Homeschoolers are doing something for all of us as American citizens, whether 
we homeschool our children or not.  A hundred years ago, Frederick Jackson Turner,
a great American historian, spoke about the closing of the American
frontier.  He cited it as a significant event in American history
because the frontier had affected the entire development of our
country and our institutions.  The famous Turner thesis was that,
if you were living on the Eastern Seaboard or in the Midwest,
and if your  employer, if your community, even if your family
or church, if any of the structured institutions in your life
became oppressive to you, if they crushed your spirit, you always
had the option of going out to territories and starting a new
life.  This westward movement was a constant in American life.
<p>
Though we no longer have that kind of frontier, homeschoolers
are pioneers in a very real sense, creating a new option, a new
frontier in education that benefits every American citizen.  By
sometimes wrestling, sometimes litigating, sometimes battling
with the state authorities, homeschoolers bring the state into
a right relationship with the citizens.  It's no longer master
and servant, senior and subject, but basically citizen and government.
 When a state government recognizes the right of parents to educate
their own children -- and note I say recognize but not grant,
because it is a <i>recognition</i> that we seek -- when the state recognizes
that right, it comes into a proper relationship and all of us
benefit.  We are all strengthened by what homeschoolers are doing.
<p>
Homeschoolers are also restoring some of the academic seriousness
in education through a commitment to educational excellence. 
So much of what we've seen in education is tragic.  In the teaching
of reading there has been an obvious &quot;dumbing down&quot;
of Americans.  The Department of Education itself admitted in
October of 1993 in a national adult literacy survey that 46% of
Americans could read at a level beyond the rudimentary level --
less than half of American adults could read anything beyond a
rudimentary level.  Now we have to have historical memory and
compare that with our own past.  James McPherson, a Civil War
historian, tells us that 90% of Union soldiers in the Civil War
were literate.  80% of Confederate soldiers in the Civil War were
literate.  Compare that with 46% today.  I would challenge any
of the opponents of homeschooling to see homeschooled children
anywhere in the United States who are not getting that vital basic
skill of reading.
<p>
I believe we must recognize what so often is
not recognized in our public education establishment:  the vital
importance of the Bible as a way to transmit literacy.  E.D. Hirsch,
a professor at the University of Virginia and neither a Christian
nor a conservative, has written a book on cultural literacy in
which he points to the Bible as the basis for English language
literacy.  He cited a fascinating example about India, where there
are over 400 languages.  In order to have a unified country, to
conduct debates in the Indian parliament or to conduct business
or commerce, Indians must speak English.  It's the only common
language they have, and the people of India must be familiar with
the Bible so they can understand the wealth of images and sayings
of the English language.  How else to understand the cultural
concepts of &quot;go the extra mile,&quot; the widow and the unjust
judge, David and Goliath and a host of other references that come
from Scripture.  Yet, our public education establishment has been
militantly opposed to imparting a greater knowledge of the Bible
to our young people.
<p>
Homeschoolers promote the importance of fiscal
responsibility.  Many of you are making a tremendous sacrifice
to educate your children, but you do so efficiently and wisely.
 In contrast, it costs the United States taxpayers in our country
some $5,500 per child to achieve not very great results in education.
 That is a national tragedy.  And all we ever hear is that they
need more, they need more.  Several years ago I met a very fine
public school principal down in Alabama who agreed with us on
so many things, yet he said, &quot;You people are always arguing
for less money for education.  We need more. And the reason that
we need more is that we don't have enough toilet paper in our
high school.  And that just is an example of how awful things
are.&quot;  Well, this roll I hold in my hand I got from a homeschool
-- I can tell you there's plenty wherever private enterprise reigns.
 The one place I know where there was a lack of such things was
on Soviet ships when they had to call Moscow and say, &quot;Hey,
we need basic commodities.&quot;  Albert Shanker, the head of
the American Federation of Teachers, has compared American public
education to Soviet agriculture, and I have an idea of what he
means.
<p>
The final thing I will say is that we've seen the involvement
of parents, of husbands and wives, coming closer together with
their children, and that has been characteristic of the homeschool
movement.  As I sat there in Washington during the H.R. 6 battle
and got hundreds of phone calls, 90% percent of them were from
mothers who were deeply concerned for the welfare of their children.
 I thought what a remarkable thing it was, and that people in
the secular political world who do studies and  write columns
ought to pay attention to this, because what you are seeing is
not a woman's movement, but a mother's movement.  You are seeing
a new movement, a new thing happening in American society.  The
feminist movement, theoretically put, argued for barriers between
mother and child in their advocacy of abortion on demand, barriers
and conflict between husbands and wives, barriers even between
women and their God.  In the homeschooling movement we have seen
all of those conflicts be resolved and all of those barriers come
down.  That's why I find homeschooling so exciting, and why I
will invite the interest of many of our friends in the press and
the academic community to study it and see this new thing happening
in America.  That's why I've come from Washington to thank you.
God bless you all.

Council, and, by extension, on behalf of many parents all over
the United States.
<p>
The Final Report of the White House Working Group on the Family
includes these words:
<p>
&quot;Parental nurturing and education of the young is our most
important national investment.  It is the fundamental task of
humanity.&quot;
<p>
Notwithstanding a few cataclysmic events, such as the collapse
of the Soviet empire, nothing has happened since then to alter
the truth of this observation, penned in 1986 by Gary Bauer, who
is now president of Family Research Council.  Indeed, it could
have been said at any time and in any place.
<p>
We often hear from child rights advocates that &quot;it takes
a village to raise a child,&quot; but  parents are indispensable.
 Not even a whole village can replicate them.  As the people most
responsible for and most equipped to discern the needs of their
children, parents must be accorded deference in all matters related
to education.  Children in public and private schools are taught
by dedicated professionals, but only because parents consent to
have these professionals participate in their children's education.
<p>
No one but a parent can understand how parents feel about their
own children.  And I am talking about adoptive parents as well
as biological parents.  Mother Teresa describes such devotion through a 
firsthand observation at her clinic in Calcutta:
<p><blockquote>
<i>I never forget, I gave a child to a Hindu family, and after
a few months, I heard that the child became very, very sick. 
And I sent for the family, and I told them, give me back that
child.   I'll take care of the sick child, and I'll give you another
healthy child.  And the father looked at me and said, 'Mother,
take my life rather than take the child.'&quot;</i>
</blockquote><p>
Like this Indian father, most parents would lay down their lives
for their children.  And they are acutely aware of their responsibility.
 So decisions about what kind of information is conveyed to children
or extracted from them are the parents' natural prerogative.
<p>
Any research methods that place a barrier between children and
their parents should be outlawed.  Increasingly, parents have
found themselves fighting for their most fundamental rights against
some hostile educators and government officials who honestly believe
that they, not parents, know what is best for children.  Such
officials work overtime to acquaint children with revisionist
history, graphic sexual materials and relativistic notions of
morality -- all in the name of education.
<p>
Often, parents are unaware of what the children are receiving.
The concept of informed consent is faulty because there are too
many ways for it to fail.  Parents are not given adequate information.
And a teacher may send a child home with an announcement about
an upcoming survey, but unless the parent signs a permission form,
there is no way to determine if the message got through.
<p>
To those who argue that written requirements are cumbersome and
expensive, well, the loss of parental freedom to determine a child's
education is a far higher cost -- one that is unacceptable.  Besides,
there are other ways that information can be obtained on dangerous
behaviors.  Documentation of the number of cases of out-of-wedlock
pregnancies, sexually transmitted diseases, suicides, drug overdoses
and the like is readily available. The drive to target all teens
because of the actions of the unfortunate few is a manifestation
of the educational dogma that information in and of itself, with
no moral reference, can make a difference.  But two decades of
research have shown that giving youngsters more &quot;value-free&quot;
information about sex, for instance, has not resulted in any behavioral
change, except perhaps earlier experimentation.
<p>
With the advent of Goals 2000, and its emphasis on national standards
and accountability, the role of testing is becoming paramount.
Outcome-based education, as implemented by Goals 2000, moves
schools away from the strictly academic and toward the production
of certain &quot;attitudes.&quot; Consequently, the line is becoming
blurred between what is educational and what is therapeutic.
<p>
Parents are concerned over surveys for two reasons:
<p>
1) Some questionnaires may reveal information that is nobody's
business but that of the family; and 2) some questionnaires convey
information to which parents would rather not expose their children.
<p>
The issue of parental consent for research has been driven primarily
by a spate of sex, suicide and drug surveys among young teens,
some of which have been politically motivated and manipulated.
A few years ago, a national youth survey on sexuality contained
questions that were so graphic as to be, in many parents' estimation,
pornographic.
<p>
Concern over research on hapless children has also been driven
by revelations of abuses by federally-funded researchers going
as far back as the sex studies of Dr. Alfred C. Kinsey in the
1940s.  It was under grants from the congressionally chartered
National Research Council that Dr. Kinsey collected his materials
for what became known as the Kinsey Report, the largest sex survey
ever at that time.  Under the rubric of science, systematic molestation
of some 317 children was analyzed and recorded in graph tables.
Nowhere is there evidence that parental consent was given for
what were clearly criminal acts.  In fact, no one, not even parents,
could give consent for such acts, but that did not stop the Kinsey
&quot;scientists.&quot;
<p>
Further documentation of this shameful episode of scientific abuse
can be found in the Family Research Council documentary video
<I>The Children of Table 34</I>, which I am submitting for the
record, and in <i>Kinsey Sex and Fraud, The Indoctrination of
a People</i>, by Dr. Judith A. Reisman, Edward W. Eichel, with
Drs. J. Gordon Muir and John Court as editors (Huntington House:
1990).
<p>
Now, we are not suggesting that the mere taking of a survey is
equivalent to the kind of abuse that Kinsey recorded.  Just that
there is a temptation to gather information because it <I>can</I>
be done without asking whether it <I>should</I> be done.
<p>
Sometimes, the impact on the survey taker seems calculated to
increase curiosity about deviant behavior.  Surveys that ask questions
about suicide or drug usage, for example, can plant the idea of
either activity as an option, when a teen may never have entertained
the thought before.  Through sheer repetition of reference, harmful
activities can lose their power to inspire natural resistance.
After all, a teen may reasonably conclude,  &quot;If we are talking
about all this stuff so much, doesn't that mean that everybody
is doing it?&quot;  Children were exposed to descriptions of homosexual
activity, for example, which is a way of forcing the topic to
the front burner.  As a homosexual activist once wrote:  &quot;The
main thing is to talk about gayness until the issue becomes thoroughly
tiresome.&quot;
<p>
Sex surveys in and of themselves are notoriously unreliable, being
skewed toward the sexually unconventional.  They can also be objectionable.
Little Susie responds to a question that asks if she is a virgin.  If she 
answers yes, then she is supposed to skip through several detailed questions 
about sexual activities, such as how many sex partners she has had.
After an exercise like that, she may feel like a sexual underachiever
for having kept chaste.  Teens are very peer conscious, and can
feel left out and stigmatized for having to exempt themselves
from a battery of questions. Likewise, if the onus is on the parent
to opt a child out of such intrusive experiences, the possibility
for stigma is greater than if all parents have to opt their children
in.  Those who administer surveys are more interested in high
compliance than parental input, so they tend to be opposed to
such safeguards.  But in the scheme of things, parents' rights
must come first.
<p>
Family Research Council supports efforts to safeguard the rights
of parents to direct their children's education and welfare, and
that includes how, where and when children are included in research.
Parents are assigned that task by no less an authority than God
Himself.  It would be the epitome of hubris to tamper with that
bond because some educational experts feel that they are smarter
than everybody else.

<title>PROMOTING TRUE ABSTINENCE IN THE ADOLESCENT FAMILY LIFE ACT</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">

<h2>PROMOTING TRUE ABSTINENCE<br>
IN THE ADOLESCENT FAMILY LIFE ACT</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<h4>Testimony of Gracie S. Hsu, Policy Analyst, Family Research Council<br>
before the Labor/HHS/Education Subcommittee<br>
of the Senate Appropriations Committee<br>
July 11, 1996</h4></center>

<p>

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As you are well aware, the Family Research
Council (FRC) has long been an advocate of premarital sexual abstinence
and of saving sex for its proper context within marriage.  We
also strongly encourage adoption as a superior alternative to
abortion.

<p>

In the past, the Family Research Council has also supported the
Adolescent Family Life (AFL) Act, or Title XX of the Public Health
Service Act, because it has historically been a solid abstinence-centered
and adoption-promoting program.  Indeed, the AFL legislation was
crafted in order to sponsor programs and research projects which
promote society's traditional sexual ethic of abstinence until
marriage.  The AFL Act articulates a compelling moral framework
for reversing the tide of adolescent promiscuity, out-of-wedlock
pregnancy and abortion, for it recognizes the fact that sex is
not simply a physical act, but that it also has moral, emotional,
and social consequences.

<p>

The two primary purposes of AFL are:

<p>

(1) To find effective means, within the context of the family,
of reaching adolescents before they become sexually active in
order to maximize the guidance and support available to them from
parents and other family members, and to promote self-discipline
and other prudent approaches to the problem of adolescent premarital
sexual relations, including pregnancy; and

<p>

(2) To promote adoption as an alternative for adolescent parents
(Sec. 2001 (b), (1) and (2) of the Public Health Service Act).

<p>

For years, AFL has stood alone in a sea of contraceptive funding,
promoting prevention rather than simply risk reduction.  Even
with its limited annual budget of about $7 million, AFL has succeeded
in helping young people choose the healthiest lifestyle of premarital
sexual abstinence.  Some AFL program successes include <I>Teen-Aid</I>,
<I>Choosing the Best</I>, <I>The Art of Loving Well</I>, and <I>Reasonable
Reasons to Wait</I>.

<p>

However, while the stated mission of AFL has remained unchanged,
in recent years, the policies undergirding AFL's mission have
been under attack by the Clinton administration, and thus, the
program's laudable characteristics have been compromised.

<p>

For example, this administration placed Felicia Hance Stewart,
a former Planned Parenthood abortionist and long-time advocate
of contraception, in charge of the Office of Population Affairs,
which oversees not only Title X, the federal family planning program,
but also AFL, the abstinence program.  Clearly, Dr. Stewart and
the Clinton administration do not subscribe to an abstinence-centered
philosophy, and their efforts to undercut and even defund AFL
are well-established.

<p>

As you will recall, the Clinton administration sought to completely
defund AFL for fiscal year 1995 and replace it with a new Office
of Adolescent Health, which would be dedicated to more &quot;comprehensive&quot;
health education and contraceptive information and services to
teens.  That this administration would consider eliminating the
only source of federal funding for teen abstinence and adoption
programs in favor of more contraceptive programs (which already
receive some $450 million every year through Title X, Medicaid,
and the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant, among others funding
streams) clearly demonstrates not only the administration's lack
of support for abstinence programs, but also its outright hostility
towards their existence.

<p>

Although the Clinton administration did not succeed in its attempt
to defund the AFL program, it has since engaged in other tactics
which undermine the program's promotion of a true abstinence-centered
message.

<p>

For example, under President Clinton, the Health and Human Services
Department modified the policy regulations regarding AFL grant
applications.  Printed in the Federal Register, this administration's
policy guidelines omit all references to parents' central role
and, indeed, even subvert AFL's core purpose of promoting abstinence-centered
programs by soliciting grant applications from contraceptive-based
projects.

<p>

Please allow me to delineate this point further.  During the Bush
administration, the Federal Register announcing AFL grant applications
stated the following:

<p>

&quot;Applications requesting support for prevention projects
should propose innovative, value-based, family-centered approaches
to promoting adolescent premarital abstinence.  Applicants should
promote parents as the primary sex educators of their children
and emphasize the provision of support by other family members,
voluntary associations, religious and charitable organizations
and other groups in the private sector in order to help adolescents
and their families deal with complex issues of adolescent premarital
sexual relations.&quot;  (Federal Register, Vol. 57, No. 19, January
29, 1992)

<p>

Under President Clinton, however, the policy guidelines regulating
the AFL program differed dramatically.  The December 22, 1994
Federal Register stated the following:

<p>

&quot;The OAPP encourages the submission of prevention applications
which propose to do the following:....(4) include medically accurate
information on sexuality, contraception, sexually transmitted
diseases (STDs) and HIV/AIDS, (5) offer educational services to
parents to assist them in communicating with their children about
sexuality, contraception, STDs and HIV/AIDS...&quot;

<p>

Mr. Chairman, as you can see from this example, the Clinton Administration
believes that parents are not the primary sex educators of their
children, but that the educational establishment must help parents
teach their children about sex.  This administration also believes
that AFL should not be a true abstinence program, but a contraceptive-based
program.  This double message about sex not only contradicts the
AFL program's stated mission, it also harms children in the process.

<p>

Therefore, Mr. Chairman, if the AFL program is to continue, with
or without increased funding, it is vitally important that the
language of the legislation be altered to reflect a true abstinence-centered
and adoption-promoting message.  We must prevent the current and
future administrations from wrongly interpreting the AFL statute.

<p>

The Family Research Council proposes that this committee take
into consideration the Faircloth-Talent abstinence language passed
within H.R. 4, the recent welfare bill that was vetoed by the
President. Under such explicit language, only true abstinence-centered
programs would be able to receive funding.  We believe that this
legislative step is necessary in order to remedy the executive
branch's tampering with the program.  Unless such a step is taken,
however, FRC cannot endorse the expansion of a program that is
so vulnerable to be used for harmful purposes.

<p>

Finally, I'd like to comment on the Family Research Council's
viewpoint regarding the government's role in funding social programs
which seek to promote any form of sexual behavior.  FRC strongly
believes that the responsibility for sex education belongs to
the parents of children.  We also believe that the federal government
does not have a legitimate role in federally subsidizing contraceptive
programs, or even abstinence programs.  Indeed, we have only advocated
for the existence of AFL in order to counter the federal government's
aggressive role in promoting contraceptive-based programs.  Therefore,
if the government is to play a role at all, it should at a minimum
sustain and promote self-restraint and marital commitment rather
than subverting them.

<p>

Mr. Chairman, we ask that you would take FRC's recommendations
under consideration.  Thank you very much.

<title>PRISONER LAWSUITS: A TOOL FOR JUSTICE OR OBSTRUCTION?</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/insight/insight.gif">

<p>

<h2>PRISONER LAWSUITS:<br>
A TOOL FOR JUSTICE OR<br>
OBSTRUCTION?</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>

<p>

Lawsuits brought by prisoners cost Americans millions of dollars
and make a mockery of the justice system. One murderer sued more
than 300 times, claiming he caught a cold from eating off of paper
plates and wasn't given enough fruit juice. A serial killer on
California's death row who sexually assaulted, tortured and mutilated
five teenage girls, sued prison officials for &quot;cruel and
unusual punishment&quot; because they served him soggy sandwiches.
A Missouri rapist, robber and kidnapper sued to have prisoners
treated to salad bars and brunches on weekends and holidays.[1]

<p>

Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
is promoting an inmate lawsuit reform bill. In his words, &quot;It's
high time to stop this outrage against taxpayers. It must not
continue any longer.&quot;[2]

<p>

Lawmakers also want to halt inmate litigation which delays executions
and overturns state court decisions via federal habeas corpus
petitions. Reforming the federal habeas corpus review process
will help repair the sagging credibility of our criminal justice
system.

<p>

Our system is supposed to serve victims and criminals by ensuring
that offenders receive appropriate and swift punishments which
act as deterrence to future crime. Unfortunately, habeas corpus
petitions, which may be well intended, delay justice and therefore
damage law enforcement's credibility. This must change.

<p>

<center><h3>WHAT IS HABEAS CORPUS?</h3></center>

<p>

Habeas corpus petitions allege that the prisoner's federal constitutional
rights were violated. State and federal prisoners can challenge
the validity of their convictions and the appropriateness of their
sentences by filing these petitions in a federal court. If a federal
judge agrees, he can issue writs ordering the prisoner's freedom,
reducing his sentence or having his case remanded for retrial
or resentencing.

<p>

Habeas corpus is Latin for &quot;you have the body.&quot; It requires
the prison warden to produce a prisoner to determine whether or
not the inmate is imprisoned lawfully and whether or not he should
be released from custody. A state prisoner who has exhausted normal
state appeals may continue to litigate his conviction or sentence
by applying for habeas corpus in a federal district court.

<p>

A growing number of Americans view such appeals as judicial obstruction.
After all, in spite of overwhelming evidence, many are filed by
death row criminals who litigate solely to delay their execution.
For example:

<p><ul>

<li>In 1974, Mitchell Blazak was convicted and sentenced to death
on two counts of murder. Between 1977 and 1988 he filed five unsuccessful
petitions with Arizona courts. In 1988, he successfully persuaded
a federal district court to vacate his 1974 trial because it failed
to consider his mental competence at the time. Crucial evidence
was lost by the federal court during the habeas corpus evidentiary
hearing, and as a result the state could not retry him and settled
for a negotiated plea agreement. Because Blazak had his presentence
credit of more than 19 years, he was returned to prison for less
than six months and released.[3]

<p>

<li>In 1977, Clarence Allen was convicted and sentenced to life
in prison. From prison he arranged for the murder of three people
who testified against him for which he was then convicted and
sentenced to death. Six years later, the California Supreme Court
affirmed the death sentence. Over the next two years, his federal
habeas corpus petitions were denied, and the U.S. Supreme Court
declined to review his case. But on September 2, 1988 a sympathetic
federal district judge issued a stay of execution which remains
in effect today -- 22 years after his first murder.[4]

<p>

<li>William Bonin was convicted and sentenced to death for the
1979 murders of 14 boys he lured inside his van, sexually assaulted
and then strangled. After nearly two decades of delays, Bonin
and 31 other Orange County, California death-row inmates have
exhausted their appeals and are awaiting execution.[5]

<p>

<li>In 1982, Robert Buell kidnapped, brutally raped and strangled
an 11-year-old Ohio girl. He was found guilty and sentenced to
death. Over a period of 12 years, he filed eight separate judicial
actions involving 36 judges. He recently filed papers in federal
court seeking yet another hearing.[6]

</ul><p>

Although 77 percent of Americans favor the death penalty for murderers,
they don't want the system to act in undue haste and execute innocent
people who may have been wrongly convicted.[7] Thus, the courts and
legislative bodies have carefully crafted a system of checks and
balances which includes federal habeas corpus petitions. The system
has saved some innocent people from execution and from the effects
of judicial errors.

<p>

Lloyd Schlup was convicted and sentenced to death in 1985 for
helping to kill a fellow inmate in the Missouri State Penitentiary.
Schlup's jury didn't hear from the 20 prisoners who witnessed
the murder and who later testified that Schlup wasn't the killer.
Neither did they see a surveillance videotape that showed Schlup
elsewhere at the time of the murder. Finally, at the insistence
of Schlup's fifth court-appointed lawyer, the evidence was heard.
The federal judge, after seeing the evidence, said, &quot;No reasonable
juror would have convicted [Schlup] in light of the new evidence.&quot;[8]

<p>

Those opposed to habeas corpus reform such as the &quot;Emergency
Committee to Save Habeas Corpus&quot; often cite the case of Roger
Coleman. In 1981, Coleman was convicted and sentenced to death
for murdering and raping his sister-in-law although no one could
place him at the scene of the crime, and four independent witnesses
corroborated his near-perfect alibi. He was allegedly denied an
opportunity to present new evidence 10 years after sentencing
because his lawyer missed a filing date by three days. Coleman
was executed.[9]

<p>

The pro-reform Criminal Justice Legal Foundation (CJLF) provides
the rest of the story. Coleman's case went to the Supreme Court
twice on federal habeas corpus petitions. He claimed that new
evidence proved his innocence but in fact, according to a federal
judge, the forensic evidence done at Coleman's request &quot;significantly
bolster[ed] the jury's finding of guilt.&quot;[10]

<p>

Another case used to defend habeas corpus review involves Cornelius
Singleton, a black man, who was executed in Alabama in November,
1992, for murdering a nun in a cemetery by smothering her with
rocks. His court-appointed lawyer refused to meet with his client,
failed to object when the prosecutor struck all blacks from the
jury pool, and neglected to tell the jury that Singleton was mentally
retarded. The court-appointed attorney was disbarred. The attorney's
mistakes were wrong, but do not negate the facts in the case which
compelled a jury to find Singleton guilty of murder beyond a reasonable
doubt.[11]

<p>

<center><h3>HISTORY OF HABEAS CORPUS</h3></center>

<p>

Habeas corpus originated in Great Britain, where it was a 16th
century constitutional remedy against the tyranny of the crown.
It is found in Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution:
&quot;The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be
suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public
safety may require it.&quot; Only once has the writ been suspended.
In 1861, during the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln did so
by proclamation.

<p>

Traditionally habeas corpus was a pre-trial remedy which guarded
against federal oppression. The right to habeas corpus under the
constitution and the Judiciary Act of 1789 limited federal government
power but didn't apply to those detained by the states.[12] The Act
gave federal courts authority to issue the writ only for federal
prisoners. In 1833, Congress made an exception for state prisoners
in cases where states were interfering with federal officers enforcing
the Fugitive Slave Act.[13]

<p>

In 1867, Congress created an enlarged statutory habeas corpus.
The intent was to help former slaves held in involuntary servitude
in violation of the 13th Amendment. This change permitted any
prisoner convicted in a state court to have the constitutionality
of his conviction or his sentence reviewed by federal courts.[14]

<p>

This change was not frequently used. For example, in 1941, state
prisoners filed 127 petitions in federal courts.[15] But after the
creation of a &quot;quasi-appellate federal habeas corpus jurisdiction
by judicial decisions of the 1950s and 1960s&quot; the number
of petitions increased dramatically.[16] In 1994, state prisoners
filed 11,918 such petitions.[17]

<p>

The 1953 Supreme Court case of <I>Brown v. Allen</I> transformed
federal habeas corpus into a general appellate jurisdiction of
the lower federal courts over criminal judgments.[18] The Court eliminated
conventional limitations on the scope of habeas review by expanding
the federal rights of state defendants.

<p>

Under Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the Supreme Court has since
imposed some limitations on writs of habeas corpus. It has narrowed
the range of claims that can be raised by prisoners who have pled
guilty. It has also restricted claims that were not properly raised
before state courts and barred rehearing of 4th Amendment claims
where state proceedings provide a &quot;full and fair opportunity&quot;
to litigate such claims.[19]

<p>

In a 1989 decision, the high court said that federal courts can't
consider habeas claims based on &quot;new rules of law&quot; that
were not in effect at the time of conviction.[20] A 1991 decision
further limits death row prisoners to one federal habeas petition
unless there is good reason why any constitutional claim was not
raised in the first instance.[21]

<p>

<center><h3>PROFILE OF THOSE WHO USE HABEAS CORPUS</h3></center>

<p>

Most of the 13,359 federal and state inmates who filed federal
habeas corpus petitions in 1994 had been convicted of serious,
violent offenses. A 1987 U.S. Attorney General study found that
40 percent were filed five years after conviction, and delays
of more than 50 years were found.[22]

<p>

Anti-reform advocates like Yale Law School scholar Libby Lewis
cite myths to defend habeas corpus review. Lewis wrote in <I>The
Baltimore Sun</I>, &quot;Federal courts have found reversible
constitutional error in 40 percent of the death-penalty cases
reviewed under habeas corpus since 1976 -- after state courts
found no such error.&quot;[23]

<p>

A comprehensive analysis of federal habeas corpus reviews in capital
cases by the pro-reform CJLF labels Lewis's 40 percent statistic
&quot;out of date.&quot; The Foundation says the overall number
is around 15 percent, and for guilty verdicts the rate is only
5 percent.[24]

<p>

The Justice Department's 1995 review of federal habeas corpus
cases provides an interesting profile. It found that four of five
habeas petitioners had been convicted after trial and had their
cases reviewed by state appellate courts. Nearly half pursued
collateral remedies in state courts, and a third had filed at
least one previous federal petition.[25]

<p>

The Justice Department found that one-quarter of petitioners allege
ineffective assistance of counsel. Others cite trial court errors,
prosecutorial misconduct and violations of the 4th, 5th, 6th,
8th and 14th Amendments.[26] Roughly one-third of the petitions address
a single issue and more than 10 percent cite four or more issues.[27]

<p>

Federal courts dispose of most habeas cases quickly. Almost all
cases (98 percent) are either dismissed or denied on the merits,
while 1 percent are granted on the merits, leaving only 1 percent
to be returned to state courts for follow-up action.[28] Almost two-thirds
are dismissed due to either plaintiff's failure to exhaust state
remedies or procedural errors. Three of every four cases are settled
in about a year, but one out of every 10 cases lasts longer than
two years.[29]

<p>

Of course, the more issues involved, the longer the case. Multiple-issue
petitions average about 925 days to resolve while single-issue
cases are resolved in 224 days. The type of issue also dictates
the length of the period for resolution. For example, petitions
which allege prosecutorial misconduct take on the average 608
days, and trial court error issues take 559 days.[30]

<p>

On December 31, 1994, the Justice Department found there were
2,890 prisoners under sentence of death. During the period from
1977 to 1994, a total of 4,557 persons entered state and federal
prisons under sentences of death, and 1,790 of them have been
removed as a result of resentencing, retrial, commutation or death
while awaiting execution.[31]

<p>

In 1989, CJLF studied 100 capital habeas corpus cases from the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. It found that
40 percent of the court's final judgments resulted in relief.
Anti-reform advocates use this as evidence that habeas reviews
identify systemic deficiencies in state courts. But on closer
examination of each case, the states reached a reasonable decision.
The cases that gained federal relief came because the law had
changed, the claim was never properly presented to the state courts,
or because the courts simply disagreed with state jurists.[32]

<p>

A 1994 study by the National Center for State Courts came to a
similar conclusion. It found that the success rate for capital
habeas petitioners was &quot;vastly overstated.&quot; It found
that federal courts gave relief in 15 percent of capital cases
examined.[33]

<p>

<center><h3>WHY NOT CHANGE HABEAS CORPUS REVIEW?</h3></center>

<p>

Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote in 1992 that there
is no case in which &quot;a state court's incorrect legal determination
has ever been allowed to stand because it was reasonable. . .
. We have always held that federal courts, even on habeas, have
an independent obligation to say what the law is.&quot;[34]

<p>

Habeas provides a mechanism to protect a criminal's constitutional
rights from abusive state courts. In 1982, a police officer in
Houston, Texas was gunned down during a routine traffic stop.
Police killed one of the assailants and charged the other with
the officer's murder. A jury convicted the man and sentenced him
to death. Texas denied him a rehearing. The man, an illegal alien,
filed a habeas petition. The federal judge found that prosecutors
had threatened witnesses, failed to disclose evidence that showed
the man's innocence and used false evidence at trial. The man's
life was saved.[35]

<p>

Hugo Bedau, a professor at Tufts University and an authority on
the death penalty, defends habeas, saying, &quot;It's absolutely
critical if we're going to have a death penalty system that we
provide adequate safeguards lest we make an irreversible, catastrophic
mistake. And we know that mistakes are constantly made.&quot;[36]

<p>

Leigh Dingerson, with the National Coalition to Abolish the Death
Penalty, also defends habeas corpus petitions. The &quot;real&quot;
implication of the habeas reform effort, according to Dingerson,
is that &quot;we'll see cases with significant constitutional
error slide through the courts without review. . . . Most death
row inmates were very poorly represented by trial counsel. . .
. So the more we limit the appeals process, the more we risk executing
defendants simply because they had a lousy lawyer.&quot;[37]

<p>

&quot;Without a review process conducted by a federal judge sitting
for life,&quot; said Michael Knoll, head of the Death Penalty
Information Center, &quot;you are going to see a lot more errors
go through -- errors that will lead to executions.&quot;[38]

<p>

Those opposed to habeas reform explain that state judges, who
may be elected [this is true in seven of the 50 states], and who
sometimes are former prosecutors, are subject to local political
pressures which could influence their trial decisions. This is
why federal courts are run by judges who are appointed for life
and are immune to many of the same pressures.

<p>

Former Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice Arthur England supports
federal review of state decisions. &quot;We've had instances in
Florida where innocent people came very close to being executed,&quot;
but they were saved by federal review.[39]

<p>

Former president of the American Bar Association, John Curtin,
Jr., supports habeas review of state decisions. &quot;Miscarriages
of justice cannot be tolerated in a civilized society.&quot;[40] Habeas
review acts as a responsible check on the system.

<p>

<center><h3>WHY CHANGE HABEAS CORPUS REVIEW?</h3></center>

<p>

Jerri Davis, whose son was viciously murdered in 1979 by a killer
who has delayed his execution for 17 years, argues, &quot;As long
as he's sitting up there, there's resentment. He has his life.
He has his card games, his exercise, his TV. We're feeding him.
We're clothing him. It's not fair.&quot;[41]

<p>

Death-row inmates like the killer of Davis's son have manipulated
the courts. They have nothing to lose, and the taxpayer picks
up the tab. Even Justice O'Connor cautions federal courts to be
&quot;fair to the states, in not disrupting the states' enforcement
of their criminal laws.&quot;[42]

<p>

&quot;There are some crimes that are so brutal that society expects
and demands the death penalty,&quot; says Michael Capizzi, an
Orange County, California district attorney. &quot;If you take
a quick snapshot of the devastation to human beings you understand
why an overwhelming majority of the people in the state favor
the death penalty.&quot;[43]

<p>

An ABA report shows that even the simplest cases, where relief
is denied at every stage, will still go to the high court at least
three times and to federal district and appellate courts twice.
That's after all state-level options are exhausted.[44]

<p>

Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has criticized the death
penalty appeals process. &quot;The state has, as noted, a strong
interest in executing its duly acquired judgment.&quot; Referring
to a convicted murderer who has delayed his execution via the
appeals process for 15 years, he says his &quot;interest . . .is
entirely indeterminate, and for all we know non-existent. He seeks
additional time not in order to elaborate on a known claim, but
in order to develop a claim.&quot; Judge Scalia fears that the
current process allows executions to be &quot;stayed 
indefinitely.&quot;[45]

<p>

Paul Kamenar, director of the Washington Legal Foundation, says
that reforming habeas corpus and the 1976 revival of the death
penalty will improve criminal justice. But he warns, &quot;The
deterrent effect of any punishment depends on how swiftly the
punishment is applied.&quot;[46] Given the long delays for appeals
between sentencing and execution, many citizens have grown disillusioned
with the justice system.

<p>

Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Fla.), chairman of the House Judiciary Crime
Subcommittee, wants to limit habeas corpus appeals. &quot;It sends
the message of swiftness and certainty of punishment that has
been missing from our criminal justice system for some time, and
it goes a long way to restoring deterrence to the criminal justice
system.&quot;[47]

<p>

Rep. Steve Chabot (R-Ohio) supports changing the appeals process
&quot;because of the length of time that people remain on death
row at taxpayer expense. The people in this country are sick and
tired of paying for cable TV and . . . for food and lawyers for
those who have killed innocent people.&quot;[48]

<p>

John Collins, with the Springfield, Va., Citizens for Law and
Order, expresses a widely held belief that &quot;with repeated
review, there's never any finality, and there is continued victimization
of families.&quot; He asked, &quot;If you have federal review
after you've had full and fair state court consideration, why
have the state courts at all?&quot;[49]

<p>

Reform advocates contend that death-row inmates intentionally
withhold claims and wait until the last minute to petition federal
courts to gain execution delays. William Kopney, an Orange County
appellate attorney, said, &quot;Don't underestimate the ingenuity
of the people who are struggling 24 hours a day to save someone's
life when they believe the trial wasn't fair, or there's a miscarriage
of justice . . . . It's common for 11th-hour requests to strike
some responsive chord.&quot;[50]

<p>

<center><h3>LEGISLATION TO REFORM HABEAS CORPUS</h3></center>

<p>

Many Americans want Congress to do something to reverse what they
perceive to be the abuse of the justice system by inmates. Americans
are also cynical about a liberal judiciary that appears to place
criminals' rights before victims' rights.

<p>

That's the impetus for legislative action to curb habeas corpus
abuse. In 1983, then-Attorney General William French Smith suggested
enactment of legislation abolishing federal habeas corpus as a
post-conviction remedy for state inmates.[51] Although Attorney General
Edwin Meese III agreed, Congress failed to act.[52] More recent attorneys
general echo agreement.

<p>

Following the April, 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, President Clinton
called for &quot;swift justice&quot; and gave his support to an
anti-terrorism bill. In both the Senate and House versions, that
bill includes habeas corpus reform.

<p>

The Senate version (S. 735, &quot;Comprehensive Terrorism Act
of 1995&quot;) requires that a prisoner show that his conviction
or sentence violated &quot;clearly established federal law, as
determined by the Supreme Court of the U.S.&quot;[53]

<p>

The House version (H.R. 2703, &quot;The Effective Death Penalty
and Public Safety Act&quot;) incorporates habeas corpus reform
that establishes a six-month statute of limitations during which
a prisoner must file paperwork to receive an appeal hearing in
capital offense cases. Non-capital defendants have one year in
which to file appeal paperwork. Once the appeal has been filed,
the federal court must hear the case within four months. If the
petitioner loses at the district court, he may appeal only if:
(1) newly discovered evidence demonstrates clearly and convincingly
that no reasonable fact-finder would have found the defendant
guilty in his original trial, and (2) a new rule of constitutional
law, made retroactive by the Supreme Court, is issued which was
previously unavailable.

<p>

Officials at the Office of Management and Budget criticize the
proposed changes. In their view, the proposed reform will &quot;subject
[the law] to potentially meritorious constitutional challenge.&quot;[54]
OMB says the proposal presumes to instruct federal courts on the
decisions those courts should reach on the meaning of the Constitution.

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

The battle over habeas corpus reform will become a constitutional
confrontation between the judiciary and the legislature. Congress
can make law, but the high court has sway over issues of constitutionality.

<p>

The issue of protracted appeals by convicted criminals touches
deep emotions, especially among victims and their families. It
costs taxpayers millions of dollars to support inmate litigation
and sustain the judicial system. While appeals are in process
the friends and family of the victims suffer because they believe
justice has not been served. After almost every execution, the
victim's family says something to the effect of, &quot;At least
I can rest. Justice has been served.&quot;

<p>

It's time for habeas corpus reform that balances constitutional
rights and ensures justice. Any change must equally address three
tenets: swift punishment means better deterrence; limitless and
meritless appeals deny justice and displace taxpayer funds from
other programs; and hasty punishment may result in injustice to
those wrongly convicted.

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=5>Taxing Your Sleep</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>By Peter J. Ferrara<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<hr>
<P>
 After you finally completed your income tax return last April
and mailed it off, you may have needed to get away for a few days.
 So you may have decided to spend a few nights at your favorite
getaway.  What you probably didn't realize was how much you were
<a href="/atr/tax-presentation/hotloped.html">paying in taxes again</a> when you paid your hotel bill.
<P>
 The consumer generally must pay a state sales and use tax on
the hotel room of about 7%.  Local occupancy taxes charge another
6%.  This means the consumer directly pays at least 13% of the
cost of a hotel room in taxes.
<P>
 But that is just the beginning.  Out of the amount the consumer
pays to the hotel, the hotel must pay Federal income taxes, state
income taxes, Federal payroll taxes, sales taxes, capital gains
taxes, unemployment insurance taxes, workmen's compensation taxes,
business license taxes and fees, utility taxes, local property
taxes, and any local income taxes.  The hotel must also pay Federal
and state excise taxes on its telephones.
<P>
 Altogether, these taxes average about 30% of the price of a hotel
room.  Counting the taxes paid directly by the consumer, this
means about 43% of what you pay for a hotel room goes to the government
in taxes rather than for the room.  Out of an average price for
hotel rooms of $80 per night, this means about $34.40 goes for
taxes.  Everything that goes into building and maintaining the
hotel room is paid for by the 57% of the rate charged to the consumer,
or about $45.60 on average, remaining after taxes are paid.
<P>
 A number of jurisdictions impose additional taxes on hotel guests
as well.  This includes a nightly utility tax, a liquor excise
tax, and a food and beverage tax.  A telephone excise tax is also
charged on the use of all phones.
<P>
 These taxes are unfair to workers.  In a democracy, taxes should
not be hidden in the prices of products people buy.  They should
be explicit and clear, so that voters can determine whether they
think those taxes are worth what they are getting from their government.
<P>
 Thomas Jefferson wrote, &quot;Government should not take out
of the mouth of labor the bread that it has earned.&quot;  But
that is exactly what our greedy and overreaching government does
today.  It taxes you on your income when you earn it, and taxes
it again when you spend it, and taxes you over and over again
along the way.  As a result, the average family today actually
pays more in taxes than on food, clothing, and shelter combined.
<P>
 Tax relief for working people is long overdue.  Such tax reduction
would give workers more control over their own incomes and economic
future.  A major tax reduction would also greatly stimulate the
economy, leading to more jobs, higher wages, and expanded economic
opportunity and prosperity.

<p>

<b>Q: In restricting marriage to one man and one woman, aren't
you imposing your beliefs on others?</b>

<p>

A: Marriage has been the foundation of civilization for thousands
of years in cultures around the world. It is the single most important
social institution, and it is the basis for the procreation of
children and the heart of family life. Those who are trying to
radically redefine it for their own purposes are the ones who
are trying to impose their values on the rest of the population.
Ordinary people did not pick this fight. They are not the aggressors.
They are merely defending the basic morality that has sustained
the culture for everyone against a radical attack.

<p>

<b>Q: Oh, come on. Whom does it really hurt if a same-sex couple
want to get married?</b>

<p>

A: When homosexual couples seek state approval and all the benefits
that the state reserves for married couples, they impose the law
on everyone. According non-marital relationships the same status
as marriage would mean that millions of people would be disenfranchised
by their own governments. The state would be telling them that
their beliefs are no longer valid, and would turn the civil rights
laws into a battering ram against them:

<p><ul>

<li>Business men and women would be required to provide &quot;family&quot;
health benefits to homosexual couples.

<p>

<li>Children would be taught in schools that homosexual sex is
the moral equivalent of marital love.

<p>

<li>Same-sex &quot;marriage&quot; would facilitiate the adoption
of children by homosexual couples.

<p>

<li>Sex-based distinctions in the law would be removed (as was
proposed in the rejected Equal Rights Amendment).

</ul><p>

Law is not a suggestion, but, as George Washington observed, it
is force. Official state sanction of same-sex relationships as
&quot;marriage&quot; would bring the full apparatus of the state
against those who believe that marriage is between one man and
one woman. Traditional morality would, in effect, be outlawed.

<p>

<b>Q: But if two people -- any two people -- love each other,
why not let them marry?</b>

<p>

A: Marriage is not just a matter of feelings. It is the specifically
defined legal, social, economic and spiritual union of a man and
a woman. The two sexes must be present for it to be marriage.
If that definition is radically altered based on the &quot;feelings&quot;
of those in other relationships, then the sky is the limit. There
is no logical reason for not letting several people marry, or
for gutting other requirements, such as minimum age, blood relative
status or even the limitation of the relationship to human beings.

<p>

<b>Q: Don't morals change? Haven't we heard all these tired phrases
used in defense of not letting women vote or even in defense of
slavery?</b>

<p>

A: Various social movements have succeeded because they were in
accord with natural law and the basic precepts of the moral code.
Homosexuality has never been considered morally good, and it is
a quantum leap from ending slavery to saying that homosexuality
must now be considered good, healthy and worthy of state-protected
benefits. Homosexuals enjoy all the rights every other citizen
already has -- they can vote, own property, etc.-- but they cannot
claim special treatment beyond those rights. Anytime they achieve
that, they threaten the civil rights of those who disagree with
them.

<p>

<b>Q: For years, in some Southern states, blacks and whites were
prevented from marrying by anti-miscegenation laws. Eventually,
the courts overturned these laws. Aren't same-sex couples being
similarly discriminated against? Isn't it only a matter of time
before these repressive laws are also overturned?</b>

<p>

A: As Colin Powell has observed, skin color and sexual behavior
are entirely different. The first is a benign, inborn characteristic
that has no bearing on conduct or character; the second is behaviorally-based
and has everything to do with character, morality and society's
basic rules of conduct. If the civil rights laws begin deviating
into behavior and away from race, ethnic origin, place of birth
or other immutable characteristics, there is no stopping point.
New laws would have to be coined almost daily to accommodate the
flood of claims based on behavior (smokers, compulsive gamblers,
pornography fanatics, sex addicts and pedophiles could all claim
new &quot;rights&quot; to protection against discrimination).
One non-immutable characteristic that does get protection is religion,
because that is enshrined in the Constitution. But there is no
constitutional right to engage in sodomy (see <I>Bowers v. Hardwick</I>)[1]
and demand that the state elevate it into protected status.

<p>

<b>Q: But studies show that homosexuals are born that way. How
then can you blame them for their condition?</b>

<p>

A: Nobody is &quot;blaming&quot; anyone for having homosexual
desires. The &quot;genetic&quot; studies that have been publicized
have been conducted by self-styled homosexual activists or have
been misrepresented in the media. The studies themselves typically
have tiny sample sizes, biased selection, and other major methodological
flaws, and are not replicated by reputable scientists.[2] By contrast,
70 years of therapeutic counseling and case studies show a remarkable
consistency concerning the origins of the homosexual impulse as
an uncompleted gender identity seeking after its own sex to replace
what was not fully developed.[3] Do homosexuals choose to be gay?
Mostly, no, but they can choose their behavior, and they can change
their orientation,[4] as researchers Masters and Johnson showed in
their landmark studies[5] and as numerous examples of successful
personal transformation testify.[6]

<p>

<b>Q: Isn't the traditional view of marriage religious in nature?
And if so, doesn't the restriction of marriage to one man and
one woman violate the religious beliefs of those who disagree?</b>

<p>

A: Although marriage does indeed arise from religious traditions,
most notably the Bible, it is an independently quantifiable good
for society. Hence, the state has an interest in preserving and
protecting the special status of marriage, regardless of religious
beliefs. A society can get along just fine without any homosexuality,
but no society can get along without marriage. That is why the
state encourages marriage. In 1885, the Supreme Court felt so
strongly that marriage was to be protected that it declared it
as a requirement for admission of new states to the Union. Any
prospective state, the court said, had to have law resting &quot;on
the basis of the idea of the family, as consisting in and springing
from the union for life of one man and one woman in the holy estate
of matrimony; the sure foundation of all that is stable and noble
in our civilization, the best guaranty of that reverent morality
which is the source of all beneficent progress in social and political
improvement.&quot;[7]

<p>

<b>Q: What about childless couples? Since you say that marriage
must be protected partly because of its importance in forming
families, does this mean that heterosexual couples who do not
have children shouldn't get marriage licenses?</b>

<p>

A: Of course not. Although most people marry with the intention
of someday starting families, the married couples who do not have
children still have the potential for becoming mothers and fathers,
either biologically or through adoption. Marriage is a societal
good even without children, as husbands and wives serve as role
models for children in their neighborhoods. Procreation is an
important aspect of society's high regard for marriage, but it
is not the only reason marriage is protected. Children do not
benefit when homosexuality is presented as a neutral or positive
lifestyle choice.

<p>

<b>Q: But with the threat of AIDS and other diseases among promiscuous,
homosexual men, wouldn't it be a societal good to encourage homosexual
monogamy?</b>

<p>

A: In cities where homosexual monogamy is already being encouraged,
AIDS and other sexually-transmitted diseases are skyrocketing.[8]
It is not &quot;homophobia&quot; that is causing this, but the
behavior itself, which is destructive emotionally, physically
and morally to individuals, families and societies. That is why
it has been discouraged in all successful cultures. Socrates and
Plato wrote that homosexuality was harmful to individuals and
society and should be discouraged. Even in &quot;steady&quot;
homosexual relationships, dangerous sex occurs, since the defining
homosexual sex act is patently unhealthy by any standard. State
sanction of homosexuality in any form is an invitation to the
young to experiment with something that may prove deadly. Any
public health benefits available by discouraging promiscuous homosexual
activity can be achieved without redefining traditional marriage,
which is per se a profoundly important public health measure.

<p>

Besides, homosexual literature acknowledges that homosexual 
&quot;monogamy&quot; is largely fictional. Most homosexual relationships 
are fleeting. Those that endure more than a few years do so because of an 
agreement to have outside partners. As <I>New Republic</I> editor Andrew
Sullivan, a homosexual, writes in his book <I>Virtually Normal</I>,
&quot;the openness of the contract&quot; of homosexual &quot;marriage&quot;
reflects &quot;greater understanding of the need for extramarital
outlets between two men than between a man and a woman.&quot;
In other words, the homosexual concept of &quot;monogamy&quot;
is non-monogamous. Homosexual activist Michaelangelo Signorile
frankly admits that the goal of homosexual activists is to &quot;fight
for same-sex marriage and its benefits and then, once granted,
redefine the institution of marriage completely, to demand the
right to marry not as a way of adhering to society's moral codes
but rather to debunk a myth and radically alter an archaic 
institution....&quot;[9]

<p>

<b>Q: Don't most people want homosexuals to be treated fairly?</b>

<p>

A: Yes. Most people have no ill will toward homosexuals, but this
does not mean that a tiny segment of the population (less than
2 percent) should be allowed to radically redefine society's moral
code. Even in liberal Hawaii, recent polls show that more than
70 percent of residents oppose same-sex &quot;marriage,&quot;
and national polls show that about two-thirds of respondents oppose
same-sex &quot;marriage.&quot; This is not about tolerance, but
about a tiny group seeking to use the law to impose its version
of morality on everyone else.

<p>

<b>Q: Still, don't homosexuals suffer discrimination when they
can't marry?</b>

<p>

A: No. Homosexuals have precisely the same right to marry as anyone
else. Marriage is the bringing together of the two sexes. That
is the whole point. To enter marriage, you must meet its qualifications.
Any attempt to get around the rules that everyone else plays by
is an attempt to have special rights, not equal rights. Eliminating
an entire sex from the picture and then calling it &quot;marriage&quot;
is not a mere expansion of an institution, but rather the destruction
of a principle.

<p>

<b>Q: What about domestic partnerships? If you won't go along
with same-sex &quot;marriage,&quot; why not at least allow committed
same-sex couples to get some benefits?</b>

<p>

A: The state should never be in the business of encouraging unhealthy
behavior by granting special benefits for it. A homosexual life
does not offer the richness of the complementary relationship
that men and women find in marriage and family life. People should
not be written off as if they can do no better than be mired in
an unhealthy, unnatural behavior. The more that homosexuality
is encouraged, the more damage will be wreaked among individuals,
families and society. This is not compassion but its opposite:
a ruthless social Darwinism that devalues people as impulse-driven
incorrigibles. Each human soul is of inestimable worth, and homosexuals
are no different from anyone else. They deserve the truth, not
an officially sanctioned lie.

<title>A TWO-YEAR UPDATE ON HOMOSEXUALS IN THE MILITARY</title>

<p>

<h2>A TWO-YEAR UPDATE ON<br>
HOMOSEXUALS IN THE<br>
MILITARY</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Lieutenant Colonel Robert L. Maginnis (U.S.A., Ret.)</i></center>

<p>

One of Bill Clinton's first acts as president was to try to pry
open the military to service by homosexuals. That effort met with
great opposition and led to a Democratic Congress codifying the
military's long-standing ban on homosexual service. But the Clinton
administration did an end run around that law and wrote implementing
regulations that are inconsistent with the law and that have caused
considerable confusion.

<p>

The second anniversary of the implementation of these regulations
was used to expose that confusion. On February 27, 1996, the Washington-based
Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, an advocacy organization
for homosexuals in the military, claimed to have documented 363
cases in the last year in which military officials violated the
Clinton administration's homosexual regulations by directly asking
members about their sexual orientation or harassing members suspected
of being homosexual. As evidence, it cited rising discharges for
homosexuality.[1]

<p>

The Pentagon discharged 722 homosexual service members in fiscal
1995, compared with 597 in 1994. The Pentagon attributes the 17
percent increase to a different reporting method by the Air Force.
There were 949 discharges for homosexuality in 1991, 708 in 1992
and 682 in 1993.[2]

<p>

Prior to 1994 the Air Force, when it found homosexual activity
during basic training, discharged that person for &quot;fraudulent
enlistment&quot; rather than for homosexuality. This procedure
changed in 1994, and that's why there is an increase in the number
of homosexual discharges in 1995. Discounting 163 Air Force discharges
that fit this category, the Pentagon's 1995 figure would be 559,
the lowest in many years.[3]

<p>

The Servicemembers Legal Defense Network has accused military
officials of overstepping their bounds to conduct &quot;witch
hunts&quot; to find evidence to discharge service members for
homosexuality. It cited the case of an Army woman who charged
that several drunken male soldiers had attempted to rape her.
She reported the incident, but her commander dismissed it. She
alleges the men then started rumors that she was a
lesbian and that this led to an investigation. The Army says it
dropped the case against the woman and is investigating whether
the commander went too far.[4]

<p>

Military investigators and commanders are also accused of pursuing
wide-ranging inquiries aimed at identifying homosexual members.
But the Pentagon dismisses the allegations of abuse. It claims
to have &quot;thoroughly investigated&quot; them to ensure fair
application of the policy.

<p>

The confusion about homosexual service is prompted by the stark
differences between Clinton's regulations and the law which is
a codified version of the military's long-standing ban. The Clinton
administration's regulations are contrary to the law passed by
Congress and signed by the President on November 30, 1993. Consider
the major differences:

<p><ul>

<li>The Clinton regulations [DOD Directives 1332.14 and 1332.30]
drop the principled statement that &quot;homosexuality is incompatible
with military service.&quot;

<p>

<li>The law [10 U.S.C. &#167; 654] forbids service by homosexuals.
The Clinton regulations permit service by &quot;celibate&quot;
homosexuals.

<p>

<li>The law requires the discharge of people with a &quot;propensity&quot;
to engage in homosexual conduct. The Clinton regulations redefine
&quot;propensity&quot; to mean the narrow term &quot;likelihood.&quot;

<p>

<li>The law relies on commander discretion to initiate investigations.
The Clinton regulations create a &quot;criminal-like&quot; standard
before investigations can be initiated. According to Secretary
of Defense William Perry, attending gay pride parades, frequenting
gay bars, and possessing gay materials are not &quot;credible&quot;
evidence to initiate an investigation.

<p>

<li>The Clinton regulations prevent military criminal investigators
from investigating adult private consensual sexual misconduct
(sodomy and adultery). The law relies on commander discretion
to initiate investigations.

<p>

<li>The law forbids homosexual service for readiness reasons,
but, contrary to 200 years of military practice, Clinton's Defense
Department no longer considers homosexual behavior a marker for
increased security risk. And information discovered during a security
investigation cannot be used for adverse action without high-level
political permission.

</ul><p>

<center><h3>STATUS OF FEDERAL COURT CASES</h3></center>

<p>

Confusion on the issue of homosexuals in the military is amplified
by the many pending federal court cases. There are five military
homosexual cases now pending at the federal appellate court level
and three cases at the district court level.[5] Most of these cases
involve servicemembers complaining that their constitutional rights
have been violated by Clinton's regulations and sidestep a frontal
attack on the law which clearly denies service by homosexuals.

<p><ul>

<li><I>Abel v. Perry</I> was heard on January 16, 1996 in the
United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. This case
involves six servicemembers who won at the district court level,
claiming that the Pentagon violated their First and Fifth Amendment
rights. This case contests Clinton's regulations and avoids the
plain meaning of the law. A decision is expected this spring.

<p>

<li><I>Thomasson v. Perry</I> was heard on December 5, 1995 in
the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. It
involves a Naval officer who complains that his discharge for
homosexuality violates his First and Fifth Amendment rights. The
government won at the trial court level. A decision is expected
this spring.

<p>

<li><I>Selland v. Department of Defense</I> was decided at the
district court level for the government on October 31, 1995. The
case was brought by a Naval officer dismissed for declaring himself
a homosexual. The plaintiff has indicated he will appeal, but
that appeal will be delayed until a decision is announced in the
<I>Thomasson v. Perry</I> case.

<p>

<li><I>Phillips v. Perry </I>will be heard on March 4, 1996 in
the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. This
case involves a sailor who claims his discharge is based on homosexual
&quot;status&quot; when in fact the Navy was swayed by his admission
of misconduct. He also claims there are sexual acts that are guaranteed
protection within a constitutionally protected zone of privacy.
He lost his complaint at the trial court level. A decision is
expected this summer.

<p>

<li><I>Richenberg v. Perry</I> will be heard this spring in the
United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. This Air
Force officer was discharged for homosexuality and lost at the
trial court level.

<p>

<li>Three cases are pending at the federal district court level.
They are: <I>Thorne v. Department of Defense</I> (U.S. District
Court for the Eastern District of Virginia; brought by a Naval
officer); <I>Holmes v. California National Guard</I> (U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of California; brought by a National
Guardsman); and <I>Watson v. Perry</I> (U.S. District Court for
the Western District of Washington; brought by a Naval officer).

</ul><p>

The Family Research Council has participated as an amicus (friend
of the court) in the five appellate cases. It was granted the
unusual opportunity to make oral argument in <I>Thomasson v. Perry,</I>
where FRC defended the law and the Clinton Justice Department
defended the faulty regulations. It will closely monitor the progress
of the three district court cases.

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

A Justice Department attorney announced during the <I>Abel v.
Perry</I> hearing that seven avowed homosexuals have rebutted
the presumption that they will engage in illicit conduct. They
now serve uncontested. This is a flagrant violation of the law
but has been allowed because of the faulty Clinton regulations.
Unless these regulations are changed, more avowed homosexuals
will serve, despite clear congressional intent to the contrary.

<p>

The intent of the law has always been to deny service to homosexuals.
It is the Constitutional responsibility of Congress under Article
1, Section 8 to write the rules and regulations for the military.
After exhaustive hearings in 1993, the Congress by a large majority
codified the military's long-standing ban on homosexual service.
The law denies service to all homosexuals, both those in and those
out of the closet.

<p>

It is hoped that Congress or a future administration will right
the Clinton administration's faulty regulations. The regulations
must be rewritten to echo the intent of the law. Meanwhile, it
is expected that either the <I>Abel</I> or <I>Thomasson</I> case
will be appealed to the Supreme Court this summer. FRC will file
a motion to argue as an amicus in that case to defend the law
which is based on the will of the American people and the findings
of the 1993 Congressional hearings on the issue of homosexuals
in the military.

<p>

A 1995 government-commissioned study claims that giving clean
needles to addicts will slow the spread of the AIDS virus without
encouraging drug abuse. While there is reason to question this
claim, even if the spread of HIV among intravenous drug users
(IDU) were slowed, this action would create some potentially undesirable
effects.

<p>

The fight to establish federally-funded needle exchange programs
(NEP) is being urged as a wedge issue to gain drug legalization.
Linking drug addiction with the emotion-charged AIDS epidemic
under the pro-drug umbrella called &quot;harm reduction&quot;
is good political strategy, but it's a bad idea that is gathering
momentum, and it must be countered.

<p>

Supporters of federally-funded NEPs are rallying around this issue.
Leading NEP researcher Peter Lurie, a professor with the Institute
for Health Policy Studies, University of California San Francisco,
says the 1995 study is &quot;a vindication for all of the needle
exchange workers around the country, as well as the scientists
who have been coming to these conclusions for years....[The government]
can no longer hide from the weight of scientific evidence....&quot;[1]

<p>

In response to the American needle study, the respected British
medical journal <I>Lancet</I> said, &quot;It is time for the U.S.
to catch up with so much of the world....Needle exchanges do not
increase drug use in programme [sic] participants. They do not
encourage or increase the number of drug users. They do not increase
the number of needles lying about; they do not destroy cities,
or towns or neighborhoods.&quot;[2]

<p>

Dr. Lincoln Moses, chairman of the 15-member panel that led the
government's NEP study, said, &quot;We must consider the reality
that people do use drugs and that HIV is transmitted in growing
numbers by injection drug use.&quot;[3]

<p>

Not everyone agrees with those who favor needle exchange. Donna
Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), has
doubts. Shalala told <I>CNN</I> that &quot;different experts disagree&quot;
as to the efficacy of needle exchange.[4] Philip Lee, Shalala's assistant and 
a former needle exchange researcher, called NEPs &quot;an extraordinarily
complex public policy strategy&quot;[5] and expressed concern that
NEPs &quot;may send a mixed message about drug use.&quot;[6]

<p>

Roman Catholic Cardinal John O'Connor said, &quot;It [needle exchange]
drags down the standards of all society.... It is an act born
of desperation.&quot;[7] Reverend Calvin Butts, pastor of the Abyssinian
Baptist Church in Harlem, agrees. &quot;I am not in favor of cooperating
with evil,&quot; said Butts. &quot;If we give out needles now...the
next step will be to legalize crack and heroin.&quot;[8] This may
be the ultimate goal of proponents of these programs.

<p>

<center><h3>LEGAL BACKGROUND</h3></center>

<p>

In 1992, Congress ordered HHS to request a study of NEPs by the
National Academy of Sciences (NAS), an independent, Congressionally-chartered,
non-government research agency. If the Academy found that NEPs
were shown to be effective in reducing HIV infection while not
encouraging drug use, then the Surgeon General could lift the
ban on federal financing for such programs, Congress said.

<p>

The Academy concluded its study in 1995 and reported that well-implemented
NEPs can be effective in preventing the spread of HIV and do not
increase the use of illegal drugs. NAS recommended that &quot;[t]he
Surgeon General make the determination called for in Public Law
102-394, section 514, 1993, necessary to rescind the present prohibition
against applying any federal funds to support needle exchange
programs.&quot;[9]

<p>

While addicts can legally buy needles in all but nine states without
a medical prescription, 45 states have laws making it a crime
to carry a needle and syringe.[10] Police in these states argue that
the criminalization of drug paraphernalia helps successful drug
arrests and prosecutions.

<p>

In 1992, Connecticut modified its syringe law to permit the possession
and purchase of up to 10 needles without a prescription. But a
state-sponsored survey found that IDU needle sharing did not change
with the new law.[11]

<p>

Community NEPs do not slow illegal needle sales. Numerous studies
have found that even where NEPs operate and syringes are available
without prescription, IDUs remain dependent upon black market
sources for needles.[12]

<p>

<center><h3>THE BATTLEGROUND</h3></center>

<p>

Needle Exchange Programs are intended to curb the practice of
sharing needles among IDUs to reduce the risk of transmitting
the AIDS virus. Residual blood retained in a shared syringe can
be passed along to the next person using the syringe. This high-risk
behavior infects perhaps 20,000 Americans with the AIDS virus
every year.[13]

<p>

Providing addicts with clean needles may slow the spread of the
AIDS virus, but questions remain. Will it lead to more responsible
behavior? Will it lead addicts to seek drug treatment? Will this
practice encourage more drug abuse?

<p>

Researchers discovered that the bite of the infected female anopheles
mosquito transmitted malaria. To slow malaria's spread, researchers
theorized, the mosquito had to be destroyed. It worked. Dr. Lurie
argues that replacing tainted drug needles with clean ones would
be analogous to removing the malaria vector.[14]

<p>

Nationwide, almost one-third of all AIDS cases are associated
with IDUs. This includes almost 60 percent of children under age
13 who contracted the virus from mothers who were abusers or who
were sex partners of IDUs.[15] Today, shared needles are blamed for
more HIV infections than in the past.

<p>

In 1981, only 12 percent of AIDS victims contracted the virus
from needles but in 1993 that number had risen to 29 percent.[16]
During the same period the proportion of new cases of HIV transmission
due to sex between men declined from 74 percent to 47 percent.[17]

<p>

Most of the IDUs are found in the 96 largest metropolitan areas.
These areas also include 85 percent of all reported AIDS cases,
and nearly a quarter (23.5 percent) of all IDUs are located in
just six cities: Boston, New York City, Newark, Philadelphia,
Baltimore and Washington, D.C.[18]

<p>

The total number of IDUs is hard to predict. The U.S. Public Health
Service reports that the population exceeds one million.[19] The 1994
National Household Survey on Drug Abuse found that 2,580,000 Americans
have used needles to inject illicit drugs in their lives and 257,000
have done so in the past year.[20] A 1994 CDC report estimates that
in the nation's largest metropolitan areas alone the IDU population
exceeds 1.5 million.[21]

<p>

<center><h3>WHO ARE THE ADDICTS?</h3></center>

<p>

Terri is a 29-year-old Hispanic mother of two and an IDU. She
said, &quot;In the beginning, it was fun. I felt like Superman....It
was like I had an 'S' on my chest and I had my mask on, and I
could conquer the world. The drugs took away the bad feelings.&quot;[22]

<p>

Terri, like many addicts, started injecting just to get high.
Soon she found that the drugs were causing more pain than relief.
To support her $200-a-day habit, Terri sold heroin, got caught,
and lost custody of her children.[23] There are more than 200,000
addicts like Terri in New York City alone.[24]

<p>

According to another addict, &quot;Shooting drugs is not a rational
act....I know what it's like to be scared of getting AIDS, but
I needed to get high so bad that I didn't think about the risk.&quot;[25]

<p>

Dr. Steven Koester, an anthropologist at the University of Colorado
Health Sciences Center in Denver, explains why addicts share needles
in spite of the AIDS scare. &quot;The laws against having syringes
made it too risky to carry them on the way to get heroin. It created
an artificial scarcity. They were sharing because they had to
-- not because of some ritual for bonding.&quot; After buying
their dope, said Koester, addicts &quot;go to the closest place
where they can have privacy and get a syringe.&quot; This is typically
a &quot;shooting gallery&quot; where, for a small fee, they can
get privacy and a needle to use.[26]

<p>

It's difficult for an addict to stop injecting drugs because heroin
depletes key body chemicals. With these gone, the body experiences
intense drug cravings and withdrawal symptoms are unpleasant.
That's why a heroin addict may need four to six injections each
day, 120 to 180 times per month or 1,500 times per year. Frequent
injections with shared needles lead to increased chances of contracting
blood-borne diseases like HIV.[27]

<p>

<center><h3>HOW NEPS WORK</h3></center>

<p>

The typical NEP client is male, has been injecting between seven
and 20 years and is between 33 and 41 years old.[28] Racial/ethnic
distributions vary considerably depending upon location. One-third
to one-half of NEP clients have never been in drug treatment.[29]

<p>

The Lower East Side Harm Reduction Center [New York City] provides
numerous services. Addicts can get &quot;shooter's supplies&quot;
like alcohol pads, cotton balls, cookers, condoms, bottles of
bleach and clean water. The exchange hands out about 1,000 needles
an hour[30] or between 15,000 and 20,000 each week.[31]

<p>

The exchange also helps addicts get into treatment programs, solves
housing problems, gives lessons on safer ways of shooting drugs,
and keeps tabs on the heroin that has made its clients sick. Warnings
about bad heroin are identified by their street names on a chalkboard
hung inside the center.[32]

<p>

Mark Gerse, the center's director, said, &quot;We've become an
information clearinghouse. If we didn't get the word out, it would
take a series of deaths to get people's attention.&quot;[33]

<p>

Terri uses the Lower East Side needle exchange which operates
out of a storefront in a residential area populated by working
poor. She explains, &quot;This place gives me hope and it makes
me feel loved....This place keeps you from hurting yourself until
you're able to make a choice to straighten yourself out.&quot;[34]

<p>

Another addict who has been mainlining for more than a decade,
said, &quot;It's good to know that there's someone actually looking
after us because the truth is, nobody else cares if we kill ourselves
with bad dope.&quot;[35]

<p>

There are approximately 75 NEPs in 55 U.S. cities.[36] They operate
either from fixed sites (stationary van, storefront, street, and
health facility) or mobile sites (walk route, deliveries and roving
vans) operating a median 10 hours per week. They are staffed with
a combination of paid employees and volunteers who may provide
a variety of services in addition to exchanging needles, such
as HIV testing/counseling, tuberculosis screening, screening for
sexually transmitted diseases, primary medical care and substance
abuse treatment.[37]

<p>

<center><h3>THE SWISS NEEDLE EXPERIMENT</h3></center>

<p>

In 1986, to counter the drug problem, the Swiss began experimenting
with NEPs. The first step was to make syringes available in every
pharmacy. Switzerland also legalized syringe sales via public
vending machines. For three francs or about $2.43, anyone can
buy two syringes, extra needles, alcohol, swabs, gauze, and a
condom packaged in a cigarette-sized pack labeled &quot;Flash.&quot;[38]

<p>

In 1988, Zurich's Platzpitz Park was opened for free needle distribution.
Up to 300 syringes were given away each day. The original aim
had been to create a &quot;safe&quot; place for Zurich's own addicts.
But before long, the city was flooded with foreign addicts. The
number of needles exchanged grew to 12,000 per day before the
park was closed in 1992.[39]

<p>

After police closed Platzpitz, thousands of addicts relocated
a half-mile away to an abandoned railway station called &quot;Letten&quot;
where the Swiss experiment evolved into a grotesque spectacle.
Needle exchanges grew to 15,000 per day.[40]

<p>

Letten became a war zone between rival drug-dealing gangs. When
police tried to investigate crimes, they faced gunfire and their
cars were attacked and overturned by addicts. Local police arrested
a drug dealer after the fourth murder within just one month. Fellow
drug dealers stormed the police station demanding the man's release
or else they would blow-up the station.[41] He was released. In February,
1995, Swiss authorities closed Letten and moved the addicts to
government-sponsored centers and &quot;shooting galleries.&quot;

<p>

Dr. Franziska Haller, a Swiss psychologist, pharmacist, and anti-drug
activist, said that Zurich's permissive drug policy was designed
to put pressure on the federal government to start a nationwide
heroin distribution program. She says this is a big step toward
drug legalization -- the ultimate goal of pro-drug forces.

<p>

Opposition to NEPs and government-sponsored heroin experiments
has not been tolerated. Doctors who protested the initial NEP
were quashed by the media and pro-NEP physicians. Even a public
school teacher who warned her elementary students about the risks
of illicit drugs lost her job because of pressure from pro-drug
groups. One of her students had died from a heroin overdose.[42]

<p>

Switzerland has the highest heroin addiction rate (30,000 addicts)
and second highest HIV infection rate in Europe. It experiences
between 350 and 400 illicit drug overdose deaths each year.[43] To
address the growing problem without experiencing more &quot;Lettens,&quot;
the Swiss federal government started giving drugs to some addicts.
Switzerland has an ongoing experiment in nine cities where heroin,
morphine and methadone are given to addicts. The project, which
is scheduled to end in December, 1996, includes 700 addicts. Nearly
half of these addicts are HIV-positive. They are given free drugs
up to nine times a day. At night they are given heroin cigarettes
to be used at home. The cost is covered by health insurance or
the government.[44]

<p>

Dr. Andre Seidenberg, who runs a Swiss government-sponsored heroin
maintenance clinic for 100 addicts, believes that &quot;[h]eroin
consumption should be medicalized.&quot; He would &quot;like to
see heroin distribution trials in the U.S.&quot;[45]

<p>

The experiment's aim is to improve addict health, decrease criminal
activity, cut addicts off from drug dealers and stop abuse. Unfortunately,
the number of addicts is rising, and the experiment has not cut
illegal drug abuse and crime. It is also reported that police
officials in Bern and Zurich have been ordered not to arrest drug
consumers and dealers.[46]

<p>

On July 1, 1995, Swiss prison authorities began experimenting
with heroin-addicted inmates. Junkie prisoners with at least a
nine-month sentence who were age 20 and older were given heroin.
The rationale for this experiment was not announced.[47]

<p>

It appears that Switzerland is moving towards drug legalization.
The problems associated with NEPs and drug maintenance programs
have contributed to a shift in attitude toward drugs. On November
9, 1995, 94 Swiss executives called for the government to embrace
a &quot;harm reduction&quot; strategy that includes an expansion
of the legal heroin distribution program. Six of the executives
were representatives of American companies in Switzerland: Andersen
Consulting AG, American Express, Polaroid, Atag Ernst &amp; Young
AG, Agfa Gevaert AG and Revisuisse Price Waterhouse AG.[48]

<p>

Roland C. Rasi, general manager of the Swiss Bank Corporation,
spoke for the executives when he announced the 11-part &quot;harm
reduction&quot; strategy. The strategy would shift funds from
enforcement to treatment such as medicalized heroin distribution.
It would also demand that Swiss companies employ drug addicts
in order to better integrate them into society. He described one
Swiss company that proudly hires auto mechanics who are addicted
to heroin.

<p>

In 1996, the Swiss people will decide whether to legalize now-illicit
drugs. The vote is expected to be close. Dr. Haller said she hopes
America does not follow Switzerland's drug example.

<p>

<center><h3>WHAT DOES THE RESEARCH SAY ABOUT NEPS?</h3></center>

<p>

The Washington-based Drug Policy Foundation (DPF), which is supported
by pro-drug billionaire George Soros, has hosted several Capitol
Hill seminars to brief Congressional staff about NEPs. Arnold
Trebach, DPF's president and an American University professor,
said at one of the seminars that the &quot;[d]ominant morality
is that drug abuse is a greater threat than AIDS.&quot;[49] Trebach
said the federal government's needle exchange policy is &quot;obscene.&quot;
He says the research supports NEPs.

<p>

In September, 1995, the National Academy of Sciences announced
the results of its government-requested study of NEPs in its work,
&quot;Preventing HIV Transmission: The Role of Sterile Needles
and Bleach&quot;.[50] The panel called for the Surgeon General to
rescind the present prohibition against applying any federal funds
to support NEPs.

<p>

Dr. Moses, the study chairman, said that data from a program in
New Haven showed that the rate of HIV infection in needles turned
into the exchange had decreased by one-third.[51]

<p>

Edward Kaplan, a professor with Yale University's School of Management,
evaluated the New Haven NEP. Kaplan, a statistician, says he is
not an NEP advocate, but that he believes NEPs are effective.[52]

<p>

Moses also cited a study in Tacoma, Washington, which found a
dramatic drop in blood-borne diseases after an NEP started. That
study examined hepatitis B infection rates among NEP participants
and found these people were eight times less likely than non-participants
to contract the blood-borne infection. This study is supposedly
analogous for HIV infections.[53]

<p>

Dr. Don Des Jarlais, research director of the Chemical Dependency
Institute at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York, endorses
NAS's recommendation. &quot;Anyone who's looking at it from the
perspective of preventing HIV transmission,&quot; said Des Jarlais,
&quot;comes to the conclusion that we ought to be doing more syringe
exchange.&quot;[54]

<p>

Dr. Peter Lurie led a CDC-funded study entitled, &quot;The Public
Health Impact of Needle Exchange Programs in the United States
and Abroad,&quot; 1993. The study evaluated 23 of the programs
in 15 cities across four countries. His study was extensively
reported by the NAS. Lurie concluded that NEPs &quot;do not appear
to increase drug use and do prevent HIV infections in injecting
drug users, their sex partners, and their children.&quot;[55] His
700-page report calls for more federal funds for NEPs, repeal
of laws precluding purchase of syringes without a prescription,
and repeal of paraphernalia laws.

<p>

Lurie's analysis evaluated eight needle exchange studies that
measured drug use levels. Only one study showed an increase in
drug use. Three showed a decrease, and four found no change. Lurie
found 10 of 14 other studies that showed a reduction in HIV infection
among NEP participants.[56]

<p>

Lurie's report acknowledges numerous problems:

<p><ul>

<li>None of the studies reviewed were &quot;randomized; self-reported
behavior (subject to response bias) was often used as an outcome;
follow-up was often poor; and risk behavior was often only roughly
measured.&quot;[57]

<p>

<li>Lurie admits that he can't determine whether NEPs change the
community level of drug use, and he found no evidence that NEPs
increase use of drug treatment.[58]

<p>

<li>With regard to New Haven-type studies that test only syringes,
Lurie says, &quot;The validity of testing of syringes is limited.&quot;[59]

<p>

<li>On the key issue whether NEPs effect HIV infection rates,
Lurie states, &quot;Studies of the effect of NEPs on HIV infection
rates...probably cannot provide clear evidence that NEPs decrease
HIV infection rates. However, NEPs do not appear to be associated
with increased rates of HIV infection.&quot;[60]

</ul><p>

Even a 1993 General Accounting Office report concludes, &quot;Research
suggests [that syringe exchange programs have] promise as an AIDS
prevention strategy.&quot;[61] GAO's &quot;promise&quot; and Lurie's
&quot;cannot provide&quot; are not comforting conclusions.

<p>

On April 6, 1995, ABC's Catherine Crier interviewed Ton Quadt,
the Dutch Drug Rehabilitation Coordinator. Quadt said, &quot;If
you put in enough clean syringes and needles, people don't have
to use dirty needles, so the risk of getting HIV is lessened.&quot;
Since the program began 10 years ago, the AIDS infection rate
of those in the program has dropped from 11 percent to 4 percent.[62]

<p>

Enthusiasm for NAS's recommendation to lift the ban on NEP funding
is not universally shared. Assistant Secretary of HHS Philip Lee
said, &quot;I have not been convinced on the evidence that has
been presented so far.&quot;[63] His skepticism is well founded.

<p>

On October 16, 1989, then Secretary of HHS Louis Sullivan hosted
a conference with 12 scientific and legal experts to discuss NEPs.[64]
The consultants recommended designing a new multi-center experiment
lasting three to five years. Unfortunately, that recommendation
was never undertaken.

<p>

Lead consultant Dr. Edward Brandt, Jr., a former Assistant Secretary
for Health and then the Executive Dean of the College of Medicine
of the University of Oklahoma, said, &quot;It will be extraordinarily
difficult to provide a scientifically rigorous answer [with regard
to NEPs slowing HIV infection without increasing drug abuse].&quot;[65]

<p>

Considering the NEPs at that time, Brandt concluded, &quot;It
is not possible to perform a meaningful evaluation of existing
programs because none were designed and initiated with a stringent
evaluation approach as a primary objective. Also, comparison among
programs through a multi-center evaluation is not possible because
of major differences in program objectives, design, and operation.&quot;[66]

<p>

Brandt's reservations are evidenced in key studies cited in the
NAS report. For example, the New Haven study is based on a mathematical
model using six independent variables to predict the rate of infection.
The unreliability of any of these variables invalidates the result.

<p>

The New Haven study includes key assumptions. For example, it
assumes that any needle returned by a participant other than the
one to whom it had been issued had been shared and that any needle
returned by a participant to whom it had been issued had been
unshared.[67] Both assumptions are suspect.

<p>

More than half (60 percent) of the New Haven participants dropped
out. Those who remained in the program were most likely motivated
to protect themselves from infection and the drop-outs likely
continued in their high-risk lifestyles.[68]

<p>

The Yale study fails to consider the seroconversion rates in addicts
and also relies on self-reporting by addicts, a group not known
for reliability.

<p>

Additionally, most NEPs provide a host of services which account
for some of the reported &quot;success.&quot; Outreach programs
without needle exchange have been shown to have some effect.

<p>

Dr. Janet Lapey, a medical doctor, studies NEPs for Drug Watch
International, a worldwide anti-drug organization.[69] She critiqued
NAS's report, saying:

<p><ul>

<li>It downplays sexual transmission of HIV among addicts. Some
resort to prostitution to fund their addiction. After all, non-needle
using crack addicts have high incidence of HIV.

<p>

<li>It cites a NEP study that had no increase in heroin use by
young users. This is not surprising given that NEPs and drug treatment
programs are usually populated by older drug users.

<p>

<li>It fails to interview neighborhood residents near NEPs to
see whether they approve of the effect of these programs.

<p>

<li>It trivializes the drug problem and provides no solutions
other than NEPs.

<p>

<li>It does not cite studies that measured HIV seroconversion
rates, the only true indication of effectiveness.

<p>

<li>It does not measure whether drug use rises in NEP service
areas.

<p>

<li>It gives credibility to pro-needle studies and claims that
anti-needle studies are lacking. She says this biased use of statistics
is analogous to the tobacco companies using statisticians to support
their claim that smoking does not cause cancer.

</ul><p>

James L. Curtis, director of the Department of Psychiatry, Harlem
Hospital Center, wrote to New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman
to recommend against NEPs. Curtis said, &quot;On the unproved
assumption that these programs prevent the spread of AIDS, addicts
are actively encouraged to continue to inject themselves with
illegal drugs, and are exempted from arrest in areas surrounding
the needle exchange program. Indeed the addict is partially financed
in continuing this self-damaging behavior.&quot;[70]

<p>

Finally, Dr. Mitchell Rosenthal, director of the Phoenix House
Foundation, a drug treatment organization, said, &quot;I don't
think we have any data yet that is compelling that needle exchange
is making a difference.&quot;[71]

<p>

<center><h3>POLICY DILEMMA</h3></center>

<p>

California Governor Pete Wilson vetoed a bill that would have
authorized state-funded NEPs. He explained, the &quot;[r]eal question...is
whether the hoped-for reduction in needle-transmitted HIV infection
justifies sending a mixed message that will threaten to undermine
the credibility of all society's other anti-drug efforts -- especially
those preventive education efforts aimed at dissuading young audiences
from choosing to engage in drug use.&quot;[72]

<p>

The NAS agrees with Wilson's reservations. The report says, &quot;The
long-term effects of these programs on the level of illicit drug
use in communities are not yet known.&quot;[73] It acknowledges that
&quot;the act of giving a needle to an IDU has a powerful symbolism
that has sparked fears about the potential negative effects of
NEPs.&quot;[74]

<p>

Wilson recognizes the hyperbolic nature of a pro-needle policy.
&quot;If we are going to demand that young people exercise personal
responsibility,&quot; Wilson explained, and &quot;if we say that
they must suffer the consequences of their personal choices, [then]
what are they to think, when in the next breath we give formal
sanction to a project which facilitates drug use?&quot;[75]

<p>

Congressman Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.) opposes NEPs. He has said,
&quot;Our goal should be to eliminate drug abuse, not to find
a cleaner, safer way to do it. Sure, IV drug abusers put themselves
at risk of AIDS through sharing needles and, certainly, we want
to slow its spread, but there are better ways than giving addicts
needles to do their drugs.&quot;[76]

<p>

Former national drug czar William Bennett agrees. NEPs are rejected
because they &quot;may also confound a community's anti-drug efforts
by implicitly condoning the intravenous use of illegal drugs.&quot;[77]

<p>

Lee Brown, who resigned as President Clinton's drug czar last
December, said the Office of National Drug Control Policy &quot;can
find no compelling reason for the administration to depart from
existing federal policy regarding needle exchange...[It] is neither
an adequate substitute for drug treatment nor a preferred means
of entry into drug treatment.&quot;[78]

<p>

Dr. Moses, chairman of the NAS panel, claims that NEPs &quot;often
result in more referrals to drug abuse treatment.&quot;[79] Evidence
to support this statement is minimal.

<p>

Most addicts in treatment are there because of a run-in with the
criminal justice system, not because of a run-in with an NEP.
According to Dr. Lapey, only 16 percent of NEP participants voluntarily
enter treatment.[80]

<p>

Two of the three medical doctors on the NAS panel, Dr. Herbert
D. Kleber and Dr. Lawrence S. Brown, claim that the news media
have exaggerated NAS's findings and that NEPs &quot;are not the
panacea their supporters hope for....We personally believe that
the spread of HIV is better combated by the expansion and improvement
of drug abuse treatment rather than NEPs, and any government funds
should instead be used for that purpose.&quot;[81]

<p>

A myth associated with NEPs is that there is a long wait for treatment.
But according to Rosenthal, treatment candidates are not turned
away without help. There is a four-week waiting period for in-patient
treatment, but all candidates for admission are placed into a
&quot;day care&quot; program until such time as beds become available.
The &quot;day care&quot; unit lasts eight hours a day, and patients
can receive AIDS education and counseling.[82]

<p>

Rosenthal says that the greatest HIV threat among heterosexuals
is from sexual contact, not dirty needles. Clean needles will
not modify sexual behavior in the IDU. He explains that in the
New Haven study, fewer than a third of the participants employed
safe-sex practices most of the time.[83]

<p>

Dr. David Williams of the University of Michigan Institute for
Social Research says that NEPs raise important ethical and moral
problems. &quot;People can be morally compelled,&quot; said Williams,
&quot;to support a lesser harm [drug abuse] in order to overcome
a greater harm [AIDS].&quot;[84]

<p>

In response to this philosophy, Rep. Rangel said, &quot;Supporters
of free needles may have their hearts in the right place, but
they have overlooked some very important considerations. These
people should enlist in efforts to expand comprehensive treatment
and rehabilitation services. Better to stop needle use altogether.&quot;[85]

<p>

<center><h3>HOW MUCH SUPPORT DO NEPS ENJOY?</h3></center>

<p>

The DPF and the NAS report say that the public favors NEPs. They
site a 1994 survey of 1,001 Americans by Peter D. Hart Research
Associates, Inc., Washington, D.C., which showed that 55 percent
favor implementing NEPs to reduce the spread of diseases such
as AIDS.[86]

<p>

The NAS report also profiles 23 other surveys with mixed results.
A 1988 <I>CBS News/New York Times</I> national poll found that
only 40 percent of Americans favor giving injection drug users
sterilized needles to slow down the spread of AIDS. A 1989 Media
General/<I>Associated Press</I> national poll found that half
of all Americans favor giving needles to addicts given the promise
that it will slow down the spread of AIDS.[87]

<p>

To measure America's commitment to NEPs, pollsters should set
a better context for the needle question. Perhaps the pollster
should ask, &quot;Would you support giving clean needles to drug
addicts to slow the spread of HIV, if you knew that this policy
shift might increase illicit drug use among America's youth?&quot;
Most likely, a majority of Americans would answer &quot;no.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>WHAT ARE THE SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES?</h3></center>

<p>

There is ample evidence that NEPs contribute to serious social
consequences for affected communities. For example, Regina Policastro,
an editor for a small Boston newspaper, wrote about her experience
with an NEP client. On November 11, 1991, &quot;a woman, having
received a state-provided free needle, engaged in prostitution,
and overdosed right in front of Policastro's child in her yard.&quot;[88]
Police did nothing because the woman had an authorized needle
identification card.

<p>

The plentiful supply of free needles has created a rogue practice.
The <I>Boston Herald</I> reports that Boston police were on the
lookout for a junkie who obtains allegedly AIDS-tainted needles
from a local NEP and then sells them for use as weapons. An unidentified
Boston officer overheard schoolkids say, &quot;It's better than
a gun because a gun you can do time for.&quot;[89] Similar scares
are common among New York City commuters.

<p>

Reverend Steve Peterson, pastor of Holy Cross Lutheran Church
in Madison, Wisconsin, expressed grave concern that Madison's
NEP -- which is only 250 feet from the school -- will put his
parish elementary school children at risk. He explained, &quot;Our
concern is that the needle exchange violates the spirit of the
drug-free zone.&quot;[90]

<p>

Milt McPike, a Madison high school principal, said, &quot;I have
a lot of concerns about stuff like that [NEPs] near schools.&quot;[91]
His job is to protect children, and their welfare must be balanced
with the need to control HIV among drug addicts.

<p>

Nancy Sosman knows all too well the problems NEPs bring to a community.
Sosman is a member of the Coalition for a Better Community, a
New York City citizens group opposed to NEPs. Since the Lower
East Side NEP began, she says, &quot;We've seen an increase in
dirty syringes on our streets, in our school yards and in our
parks....There has been a dramatic increase in the public display
of injecting drugs.... Brazen addicts shoplift, loot and steal
to buy drugs.&quot;[92] Sosman says that there are no controls on
the number of syringes given to an addict at the NEP and in fact,
she has seen NEP participants sell their syringes to buy drugs.
Even &quot;exchange workers have been photographed selling needles
away from the NEP.&quot;[93]

<p>

New Haven Police Chief Nicholas Pastore supports NEPs. Pastore
told ABC's Catherine Crier, &quot;The thing that I feel good about
is that that heroin addict is not preying on society, is not killing
somebody, not banging somebody on the head, not breaking into
your or my home. They're getting help....&quot;[94]

<p>

That's not Nancy Sosman's observation. She says that the NEP participants
fan out into her neighborhood &quot;to buy drugs, use drugs, sell
drugs and steal to get money for drugs. Our local police will
never be able to stop the trafficking of illegal drugs.&quot;[95]

<p>

Curtis contends that NEPs are bad medicine. &quot;The police make
no attempt to arrest addicts even though it still is illegal to
possess and inject illegal drugs. The drug dealers flock to these
neighborhoods in order to sell drugs which are openly used even
in broad daylight. These neighborhoods experience dramatic deterioration
with a corrupting influence on many candy stores, newspaper stands
and grocery stores. The sidewalks are littered with used and bloody
needles, syringes and empty vials of crack cocaine. Furthermore
some addicts make a business of selling these needles to purchase
other drugs such as cocaine which they prefer.[96]

<p>

Curtis continues, &quot;Addicts commonly support their habit by
selling drugs to other addicts, by recruiting new addicts, and
by prostitution or by exchanging sex for drugs, all of which behavior
contributes to spread of the AIDS virus.&quot;[97]

<p>

NEPs &quot;promote a breakdown in law and order,&quot; the Harlem
doctor says. &quot;They are poor medicine and poor public health
practice. In fact, these programs constitute a reckless experiment
with human beings, totally unregulated by research guidelines
ordinarily applied to protect human subjects from potentially
dangerous research.&quot;[98]

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

On April 2, 1995, Saudi Arabia beheaded three drug smugglers.
A little earlier, Singapore did the same.[99] There are no NEPs in
Riyadh and few addicts on Singapore's streets. Neither country
has an AIDS epidemic.

<p>

If America seeks to reduce drug use, it must stop coddling addicts.
Drug abusers need treatment, not encouragement to keep injecting
deadly drugs. Although AIDS will kill some, most will die from
drug overdoses or other high-risk behaviors.

<p>

Congressman Rangel tells public officials not to fool themselves
about NEPs. &quot;Can police honestly enforce laws against people
who use 'government-issue' needles when the government is the
very source of the tool to commit the offense?&quot;[100]

<p>

The growing needle exchange debate is really about drug legalization.
Pro-drug forces have nurtured a cadre of scientists and others
to give their fight the appearance of legitimacy. But they have
yet to satisfy the strict, scientific requirements set forth in
the law.

<p>

Before the federal government boards this <I>Titanic</I>, it should
sponsor research like that suggested by former Secretary of HHS
Sullivan or even embrace some of Dr. Lurie's recommendations for
methodologically-sound NEP studies. Then, if the evidence satisfies
the requirements of Congress, the lifting of the funding ban could
be reconsidered.

<p>

In the meantime, missteps with the NEP policy could lead the nation
down a tragic path. NEPs provide no guarantee to solve the AIDS
epidemic nor stop the drug scourge.

<h2>REPORT ON THE 40TH SESSION<br>
OF THE UNITED NATIONS'<br>
COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF<br>
WOMEN</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>Ellen Lukas</i></center>

<p>

From March 11-22, the 40th session of the United Nations' Commission
on the Status of Women (CSW) met to discuss and approve worldwide
implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action, the U.N.'s
agenda for women's empowerment, &quot;aimed at removing all obstacles
to women's active participation in all spheres of public and private
life.&quot;

<p>

The CSW, a functional commission of the Economic and Social Council
(ECOSOC), was established in 1946 to prepare recommendations for
the promotion of women's rights and on problems requiring attention
in that field. It meets yearly and has a membership of 45 countries.[1]
The Commission was the preparatory body which produced the Fourth
World Conference for Women in Beijing last year.

<p>

In comparison to the Beijing conference, the March CSW session
was a businesslike and uneventful meeting. Since the real work
of hammering together the platform was finished at Beijing, the
CSW session included no demonstrations, no protests, no brawls.
At least 4,000 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) had gone
to Beijing, but they were not prominent or numerous at this meeting.
Even though the Commission had sent out special invitations asking
all NGOs who had gone to Beijing to come to this meeting, there
were perhaps 200 in the gallery on opening day, and on following
days, never more than a dozen.

<p>

Representatives of the Women Count Network lobbied diligently
for recognition of women's unwaged (i.e., house-) work. Bella
Abzug, co-founder of the Women's Environment and Development Organization
(WEDO), who addressed the Commission on its opening day, argued
for accreditation of a permanent roster of women's NGOs to participate
in CSW meetings, much as the Rio Conference NGOs participate in
meetings of the Commission on Sustainable Development. (This question
will be discussed further at the Economic and Social Council meeting
this month.)

<p>

Generally, government delegates to the CSW session were not the
fiery old-line feminists whose presence sparked the Beijing conference.
This time, for the most part, they were the sober permanent mission
representatives who usually serve on the General Assembly's Second
(Economic) Committee. They saw the issues which the session was
considering primarily through a Second Committee prism and were
more interested in economic questions than in ideological ones.
They also pressed for the use of Second Committee methods at the
session, such as the adoption of &quot;Agreed Conclusions&quot;
rather than resolutions in their final statements.

<p>

The meeting began with two days of general debate in which representatives
of the U.N. system gave their views on various aspects of the
organization's implementation of the document. Each of the 45
delegates on the Commission paid the expected tribute to &quot;gender
mainstreaming&quot; and spoke about his or her nation's programs
on behalf of women.

<p>

U.N. system speakers included the Secretary-General's advisor
on gender issues (Rosario Green, a Mexican woman diplomat); the
new director of the Division for the Advancement of Women which
supplies support services for the CSW; a senior advisor from UNICEF;
and a women's advisor from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR). They talked about the impact of the Beijing Platform
for Action on the CSW agenda -- new programs for girls' education
and health, including strategies against early and unplanned pregnancy,
and plans to deal with sexual violence against refugee women.
A human rights specialist from the World Health Organization spoke
on violence as a public health issue, as well as of women's &quot;right
to health.&quot; (He specified &quot;reproductive rights as formulated
by the [Cairo] International Conference on Population and Development,
as a fundamental human right in all circumstances.&quot;)

<p>

When their turn came to speak, the G77 (a bloc of 137 developing
countries, including China) demanded that implementation of the
Beijing document place more emphasis on development. The representative
of the ultra-liberal 15-nation European Union reminded the session
that, &quot;The human rights of women include their sexual rights,&quot;
and mentioned recent resolutions adopted by the EU on integrating
gender issues into programs of development aid. The EU also managed
to get in a few paragraphs supporting sex education for adolescents,
and total support for the Cairo and Beijing Platforms.

<p>

In her opening speech in the general debate, U.S. representative
to the Commission Linda Tarr-Whelan promised that America &quot;is
very serious about the implementation of the Beijing Declaration
and Platform for Action, and about fulfilling our particular commitments
announced at Beijing....It is our goal to institutionalize as
much change as possible.&quot; In establishing the President's
Interagency Council on Women, she said, the U.S. has for the first
time created a formal mechanism to deal with the follow-up to
a U.N. conference.[2]

<p>

<center><h3>THE INTERACTIVE DIALOGUES</h3></center>

<p>

From March 13-18 the U.N. staged a series of what it called &quot;interactive
dialogues&quot; (discussions between panels of experts chosen
by the U.N. Secretariat, and delegates to the Commission) on three
out of the 12 &quot;areas of concern&quot; mentioned in the Beijing
document. The three subjects covered at the current session were
&quot;Women and Poverty,&quot; &quot;Women and the Media,&quot;
and &quot;Child and Dependent Care, Including the Sharing of Work
and Family Responsibilities.&quot;

<p>

The Women and Poverty discussion ran for two half-day sessions,
March 13 and 14. A Secretariat report which formed the basis for
the discussion stressed the &quot;gender dimension of poverty,&quot;
noting that women constitute a majority of the world's poor, and
contending that they experience poverty differently from men,
because historically women have been disadvantaged in terms of
obtaining education, training and access to employment opportunities,
productive resources and capital.

<p>

Experts for this panel came from five U.N. system agencies: UNIFEM,
UNICEF, UNDP, UNFPA (the U.N. Fund for Population) and the World
Bank, as well as from various governmental and non-governmental
grass-roots organizations. To remedy poverty among women, the
panelists urged the adoption of policy agendas which would assure
women of employment and income. They also agreed on the need for
an integrated approach to poverty which would go beyond provision
of money and creation of jobs to address gender discrimination
and violence. Arguing for the value of reproductive health services
for adolescent girls, UNFPA, which insisted that &quot;education
together with reproductive health are the most important means
of empowering women,&quot; was the only expert in this dialogue
to even mention &quot;reproductive health.&quot;

<p>

In the exchange that followed, more than half the delegates had
harsh words for the World Bank, whose insistence on painful structural
adjustment policies, they said, was hurtful to women.

<p>

The U.S.'s Tarr-Whelan managed to turn her intervention in the
dialogue into a sort of Clinton campaign speech praising the administration's
concern for the poor in America and slamming Congress for neglecting
them. &quot;There is now a polarized debate in the U.S. on poverty,&quot;
she said. &quot;There is not a sufficiently shared societal concern.
In the past, we have focused on a transfer payment method. But,
increasingly our social safety net is being dismantled. Poverty,
especially among children, is increasing....We are, however, trying
new strategies and methods.&quot; Among them: efforts (encouraged
by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton) to expand business ownership
development for women and new forms of community-based credit
as well as stronger initiatives to recoup child support payments
from &quot;deadbeat dads.&quot; Tarr-Whelan's mention of the commitments
the U.S. had made at Beijing and Copenhagen made her one of the
very few delegates to bring up &quot;family planning&quot; in
connection with poverty.

<p>

The CSW discussion of &quot;Women and the Media&quot; took place
Thursday afternoon and Friday morning, the 13th and 14th. The
Secretariat report on the subject noted that &quot;the representation
in the media of violence against women, particularly sexual violence,
has increased tremendously in past years&quot; as have the production
and marketing of sexually explicit material, which is now a business
with established links to forced prostitution and trafficking
in women. The report also complained that in many countries women
lack access to new communications technologies. It also objected
to the fact that the media often portrayed women unfairly and
urged efforts to combat gender-stereotyping.

<p>

The expert panel on the subject, which included speakers from
governmental organizations, non-commercial media and the U.N.,
generally ignored the report's statements on violence and sexually
explicit material. They denounced the stereotyping of women and
praised women journalists covering the former Yugoslavia for contributing
to the focus on systematic rape during armed conflicts.

<p>

Discussion of &quot;child and dependent care, including the sharing
of work and family responsibilities&quot; ran on March 15 and
March 18. It was arguably the dialogue which will spark the largest
amount of subsequent discussion and have the greatest impact on
the family in the future.

<p>

The Secretariat report on the subject argued that &quot;women
carry a double burden of work and family responsibilities which
reinforces inequality between the sexes.&quot; More and more women
worldwide are going into the labor force all the time, and becoming
heads of households. At the same time, said the report, women's
home responsibilities do not diminish, but they continue to grow
as fewer and fewer women have the support of a spouse or of a
large or extended family to help them care for children or other
dependents. This leaves women crowded into a narrow range of low-status,
low-paying jobs from which they are unable to escape.

<p>

Panelists for child and dependent care were an odd choice for
putative child care experts. Along with a speaker from the Norwegian
Ministry of Family Affairs and representatives from the International
Labor Organization, UNICEF and the Population Council, there was
a woman from the China Family Education Association and a family
policy bureaucrat from Romania.

<p>

The Norwegian spokeswoman said that her government had recently
begun recruiting men for child care and -- although there had
been recent major court cases in Norway dealing with men's abuse
of children -- the government believed that &quot;more experience
by men of such caring and nurturing experiences will actually
prevent violence.&quot; The Population Council said that &quot;though
there is great (and not unfounded) suspicion of non-family 'center
care' in traditional societies,&quot; demand for such centers
could be created among the public by linking child care centers
up with health and vaccination programs, as well as with family
planning services. The Chinese expert gave a cheerful report on
child care in the People's Republic -- three meals a day, naps,
playtime and the possibility of Monday-to-Friday boarding facilities
from 3 years of age and upwards. The Romanian representative inveighed
against her country's &quot;repressive patriarchal tradition.&quot;

<p>

In the subsequent delegate exchange with the panelists, nearly
every country (including even Sudan and Iran) reported that it
already provided some kind of day care to help free employed mothers
from family burdens.

<p>

<center><h3>CSW RESOLUTIONS AND AGREED CONCLUSIONS</h3></center>

<p>

With the close on March 18 of the &quot;dialogue&quot; section
of the CSW session, delegates settled into smaller working groups
to negotiate the resolutions or &quot;agreed conclusions&quot;
they proposed to adopt on the issues under review. They also met
from time to time in full session to hear statements from those
delegates who had not spoken in the general debate and from concerned
NGOs.

<p>

By Thursday night, agreement had been reached on all the amendments
proposed for addition to the resolutions. By the evening of Friday,
March 22, more than a dozen resolutions were adopted.

<p>

Among them was a very commendable statement condemning &quot;traffic
in women and girls&quot; and calling for ratification of conventions
on trafficking in persons and for law enforcement against trafficking
networks and sex tourism. Another good resolution condemned &quot;violence
against civilian women and children in areas of armed conflict
and hostage taking,&quot; and a third worthwhile resolution condemned
&quot;violence against women migrant workers.&quot;

<p>

The resolution adopted on the subject of &quot;women and poverty&quot;
stressed female empowerment as essential to poverty eradication,
and urged governments to develop education and training programs
to promote women's employment and make legislative reforms concerning
the right of inheritance, land ownership, natural resources, technology,
decision-making, and protection during unemployment and maternity.
International financial organizations, including the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund, were urged to assist.

<p>

The resolution on &quot;women and the media&quot; asked, among
other things, for an end to gender-stereotyping.

<p>

The resolution on &quot;child and dependent care, including sharing
of responsibilities between men and women,&quot; asked governments
to recognize the importance of making changes in societal attitudes
toward the work that women do at home, to promote increased participation
of men in family responsibilities including domestic work and
child care, to provide for family leave, and to adopt laws upholding
equal pay for work of equal value (akin to the &quot;comparable
worth&quot; debate that has taken place in the past decade in
the United States).

<p>

Several resolutions were adopted which were specifically related
to the implementation of the Beijing document. A draft resolution,
prepared for consideration by the Economic and Social Council
(ECOSOC), approved the CSW role in overseeing implementation of
the Beijing document as well as a schedule naming which of Beijing's
&quot;critical areas of concern&quot; will be considered in future
CSW sessions. A resolution on &quot;mainstreaming the human rights
of women and girls&quot; urged that the issue of the human rights
of women and girls be integrated into all U.N. policies and programs.
A resolution commented on the U.N.'s &quot;System-Wide Medium
Term Plan for the Advancement of Women,&quot; describing how the
Beijing Platform for Action is to be incorporated throughout all
the work plans of the U.N. system, including education programs,
technical assistance programs, and contacts with governments,
academic and other institutions and NGOs. Another resolution dealing
with drafting an &quot;Optional Protocol to the Convention on
Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW)&quot; asked
for a report on the views of members of the international community
on the feasibility of initiating a reporting procedure on violations
of women's rights in states which are parties to CEDAW.[3]

<p>

<center><h3>THE FAMILY AS AN ISSUE AT THIS SESSION OF THE CSW</h3></center>

<p>

Despite the fact that most women in the world marry and have children 
at some time in their lives, the family remained a non-issue at the 
March 11-22 CSW.

<p>

There was almost no mention of the family in the 
Secretariat reports which formed the basis of the dialogues, in the 
panelists' speeches, in the delegates' comments, or in the adopted 
resolutions -- not even a mention of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights' definition of the family as &quot;the basic unit of society.&quot;

<p>

And, of course, there was no suggestion that the family has value
or that it contributes anything meaningful to society. There was
no discussion of how to preserve the family now that it is under
siege, or how to shore it up.

<p>

In the poverty discussion and elsewhere, women were seen primarily
as a labor force, with success as workers and economic decision-makers,
recipients of credit, and consumers of child and elder care assigned
as their highest goal.

<p>

Listening to the speakers at the dialogues and at the negotiations
for the resolutions, one had the impression the traditional family
had already almost totally disappeared. The great question with
regard to human relationships was how to reassign and rearrange
the roles of men and women in whatever kind of partnership in
which they are now living.

<p>

<center><h3>CHILD AND DEPENDENT CARE AS DISCUSSED AT THIS SESSION</h3>
</center>

<p>

There were really two questions approached in the discussions
and resolutions on child and dependent care. The first was the
question of how to ease the double burden women must bear in attending
to jobs as well as to family responsibilities. In the resolution
the Commission adopted on child care, measures suggested included
redistribution of family responsibilities, provisions for parental
leave from work,[4] arrangements for part-time work, more provision
of child care services, and provision of elder care and support
to persons with disabilities. (No reference was made to relieving
the burden of taxation on families with children. The Beijing
Platform for Action focuses on getting women out of the home and
into the labor force. It has no interest in bolstering the family
by tax relief or any other means.)

<p>

The second problem connected
with the question of child care was how to put a market value
on the unpaid work that women do in connection with the home.
Last September the 1995 Human Development Report published by
UNDP estimated that there is $16 trillion worth of unpaid work
done around the world annually, some $11 trillion of it by women.
Unpaid work is an issue about which women's groups staged silent
vigils at Beijing, complaining that lack of remuneration greatly
contributes to women's low social status. If the value of women's
unpaid work were to be counted, they say, it could greatly affect
inheritance rights and divorce settlements, as well as access
to credit and other issues determined by economic contributions.

<p>

At this CSW session, the question of unpaid work was complicated
by introduction into the discussions of the radical feminist terms
&quot;productive&quot; and &quot;reproductive work.&quot; &quot;Reproductive
work,&quot; used in contradistinction to &quot;productive work&quot;
(work outside the home for pay), was applied to such tasks as
&quot;child-bearing, breast-feeding, child-rearing, cooking, housework
and transmission of values [and also, in some places] fetching
water and collecting wood.&quot; The Secretariat report on child
care noted that &quot;reproductive work does not normally carry
with it the entitlement to an income, and those who bear responsibility
for it must take on additional work to generate income of their
own.&quot;

<p>

After making some attempt to wrestle with the terms &quot;productive&quot;
and &quot;reproductive&quot; work, delegates finally dropped the
terms altogether. In the resolution on the subject, they referred
to work connected with the home simply as &quot;unremunerated
work&quot; and urged the recognition of its social and economic
importance. They also urged that governments adopt laws upholding
equal pay for work of equal value, akin to the &quot;comparable
worth&quot; proposals that gained some notoriety in the United
States in the 1980s.

<p>

Although the Beijing Platform for Action (Para 68b) urges that
national and international statistical organizations should: &quot;Devise
suitable statistical means to recognize and make visible the full
extent of the work of women and all their contributions to the
national economy,&quot; including women's contribution in &quot;the
unremunerated and domestic sectors,&quot; CSW delegates decided
to skip the question of how governments might go about putting
a value on this unpaid work.

<p>

There were, however, some suggestions for devising a methodology
to include data on unpaid work in calculations of GDP[5] and other
indicators, put forward by some of the more imaginative NGOs and
by their supporters at INSTRAW (a small U.N. research institute
on women's issues). Essentially, this methodology involved conducting
&quot;time-use&quot; studies, paid for in developing countries
by development institutions and other donors, to count the time
women spend doing household tasks (including those they do simultaneously,
such as caring for children and cooking). Governments could then
factor estimates of the value of this work into the &quot;satellite&quot;
(or parallel) accounts that some countries compile as annexes
to their figures on paid work.

<p>

The present U.S. administration has shown some interest in the
issue of unpaid work by women. Hillary Clinton's speech at Beijing
made a critical reference to the lack of recognition of unwaged
work by governments, and during this CSW session's poverty dialogue,
U.S. Representative Tarr-Whelan announced that &quot;the Departments
of Labor and Commerce are undertaking consultations to determine
how best to construct reliable estimates of the value of unwaged
work in the U.S.&quot;

<p>

Last year, apparently there was a bill in the Congress (H.R. 966,
The Unremunerated Work Act) which called on the Bureau of Labor
Statistics to conduct time-use surveys of the unremunerated work
done by women and men in America, so that its value could be included
in the GDP. The AFL-CIO Executive Council in February 1995 issued
a statement on the bill, declaring that reliable statistical data
about unpaid work in the U.S. is essential to provide for the
well-being of large numbers of women, children and families in
the U.S.

<p>

<center><h3>THE UNITED STATES AS AN ACTOR AT THE CURRENT CSW SESSION</h3>
</center>

<p>

Since the purpose of this meeting was only to approve implementation
of provisions already adopted at Beijing, the U.S. was generally
less assertive at the CSW session than it has been at other recent
U.N. meetings. Even the NGOs at this session complained that the
U.S. did not cheer them on as enthusiastically as it has in the
past.

<p>

The U.S. was on its good behavior at this session even with its
recent opponents. At a negotiating meeting on the poverty resolution,
for example, when the G77 and China proposed an amendment calling
on governments to provide day care centers in very poor neighborhoods
&quot;in order to facilitate the training and integration of mothers
into productive work&quot; (&quot;a fin de facilitar la capacitation
incorporacion de las madres al trabajo productivo&quot;), the
Holy See Observer suggested to U.S. delegates that they might
not really want to back a paragraph implying that motherhood was
a &quot;non-productive effort.&quot;

<p>

The U.S. said they would &quot;take care of it&quot; and did.
When the text resurfaced the next day, it asked for day care centers
&quot;to facilitate the training of mothers for their entry into
paid employment.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>SWIMTEP</h3></center>

<p>

According to the schedule of meetings adopted in the resolution
on the &quot;Follow-up to the FWCW&quot; (that is, the Beijing
conference), the CSW will not get around to holding a &quot;dialogue&quot;
on the women's health section of the Beijing document until 1999.
Since the recent CSW session was not specifically concerned with
the issues of women's health or women's rights, there was no talk
about sexual orientation, no open mention of abortion, and no
attempt to trip the Cairo language wire on &quot;reproductive
rights.&quot;

<p>

Proceedings at the session were, in fact, so bland and bureaucratic
that one had to remind oneself that the session had quietly approved
the System-Wide Medium Term Plan for the Advancement of Women
(also known as &quot;SWIMTEP&quot;), which gives details of how
the Beijing Platform for Action --- the complete Platform for
Action, including issues relating to women's health and reproductive
rights -- is already being implemented in all U.N. policies and
programs. This is an enterprise that could radically affect society
for years to come.

<p>

To mention only a few of the tasks assigned by SWIMTEP to U.N.
entities on behalf of women's health and reproductive rights:

<p>

UNFPA, WHO, UNICEF and UNESCO will report to the U.N.'s Population
Division on promotion of women's reproductive rights worldwide;

<p>

WHO and UNFPA will provide technical guidance to governments in
the area of fertility regulation, by providing technical guidelines
on specific methods of family planning and community distribution
of contraceptives;

<p>

WHO and UNICEF will develop practical methodologies in the area
of women's reproductive health in support of governments' efforts
to implement reproductive health programs;

<p>

The U.N. system will prepare training and counseling materials
for NGOs, women's groups and health providers, and provide special
programs for girls and boys regarding responsible sexual behavior.
These programs will be run by WHO, UNESCO, UNDP, U.N. Volunteers,
the Center for Human Rights, U.N. Department for Development Support
&amp; Management Services, UNICEF and UNFPA. N.B. These provisions
make no mention of parental rights or the influence of religious
or ethical traditions.

<p>

How much effect the U.N.'s Beijing health strategy will have on
national health policies throughout the world depends to a great
extent on what resources will be available for the enterprise.
The U.N.'s budget problems must be factored into consideration
of this issue. The U.S. has not paid its assessed debt of $699
million for this year's regular U.N. budget, which, among other
things, covers operating expenses of the CSW. In addition, there
are the cuts which Congress made recently in U.S. voluntary contributions
to U.N. agencies (a total of only $285 million for such agencies
as UNICEF, UNDP and the Population Fund this year, compared to
$374 million in 1995). This will certainly be a limiting factor.

<p>

Speaking of finances for the implementation of the Beijing Platform,
SWIMTEP notes that funding &quot;will have to be identified from
all sources and across all sectors....Mobilization of additional
resources, both public and private, including resources from innovative
sources of funding, will be necessary.&quot; Speaking to this
question at the current CSW, U.S. Representative Tarr-Whelan reminded
the U.N. that the U.S. had warned it at Beijing that it expected
the Platform to be implemented &quot;within existing resources, through
reordering priorities and thinking creatively.&quot;

(3/6/96) of the results of a recent U.S. Government survey
on the use being made of the U.S. Family and Medical Leave Act
of 1993.  This law says that companies with more than 50 employees
must provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to workers needing
to care for seriously ill parents, spouses, themselves, or their
children.  The survey showed that only 2 percent of U.S. workers
have availed themselves of the provisions of the law since it
was enacted; 59 percent of leave-takers said they did so to attend
to their own health, not to take care of elderly parents, sick
spouses or children.

<h2>DESIGNER DRUGS MAKE A<br>
COMEBACK</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>

<p>

A 1960s-era designer drug is making a dramatic comeback and may
do to the 1990s what cocaine did to the 1980s. The use of methamphetamine,
known on the street as speed, ice, crank, crystal meth or the
&quot;poor man's coke,&quot; is rising dramatically.

<p>

<center><h3>WHAT IS METH?</h3></center>

<p>

Meth is a synthetic central-nervous system stimulant of the amphetamine
family. It was discovered by a Japanese chemist in 1919, and was
used extensively by all sides during World War II to fight fatigue
and enhance performance.

<p>

In small doses, meth has been used by combat pilots to keep alert,
and by astronauts to be ready for critical decisions at the end
of long missions. A <I>USA Today</I> story last fall claimed President
John F. Kennedy used small quantities, and that German dictator
Adolph Hitler was known to be a meth abuser.[1]

<p>

<center><h3>HOW DOES METH AFFECT THE USER?</h3></center>

<p>

Larry Lewman, Oregon State Examiner, said, &quot;It's not as lethal
[as crack], but it's cheaper. And it causes a toxic psychosis
and (users) can be absolutely irrational for days.&quot;[2]

<p>

Meth can have a bizarre effect on some. While high on meth, Eric
Smith thought his 14-year-old son was demon-possessed. He murdered
his son, cut off the boy's head, and tossed it out of the window
of his van.[3]

<p>

Such irrational and often violent behavior is common among meth
abusers. According to Dr. Alex Stalcup, former medical director
of the Haight-Asbury free clinic, &quot;I have [meth] patients
come in with as much as 19 to 20 days of no sleep. They are very
dangerous, paranoid, talking weapons. Some hold themselves in
a house, take hostages and begin shooting out the windows.&quot;[4]

<p>

Ronald Siegel, a psychopharmacologist at the UCLA school of medicine,
said of meth users, &quot;They're wired to be alert, on guard
and primed for action.&quot;[5]

<p>

The downside of meth's euphoria is an amphetamine psychosis. It
can last for months. The person becomes agitated, on edge and
paranoid. A meth crash can be deadly for children, spouses and
friends of the user.

<p>

The signs of meth abuse are: weight loss, irritability, excitability,
paranoia, wandering attention, sleeplessness for days and then
sleeping for 24 to 36 hours straight.[6]

<p>

<center><h3>WHERE DOES METH COME FROM?</h3></center>

<p>

In the late 1980s, traffickers and clandestine laboratory operators
discovered that ma huang, an extract from the ephedra plant, the
world's oldest known cultivated plant, could be used to produce
methamphetamine. This discovery prompted the U.S. government to
impose controls on ephedrine.

<p>

The ephedra plant is grown in China, India, the Czech Republic
and, at one time, was sown as a ground cover in the western U.S.
by the Bureau of Plant Industry. Frontier Americans called ephedrine
&quot;Mormon tea&quot; because it was drunk by Mormons in lieu
of regular coffee and tea, which are off-limits. It was also called
&quot;whorehouse tea&quot; because settlers believed it cured
venereal disease.[7]

<p>

Although ephedrine is not sold in large quantities for fear it
will be used to produce meth, it is legally available as a treatment
for asthma. Pseudoephedrine is readily available as a nasal decongestant.
Ephedrine tablets are also sold as an herbal supplement under
such names as &quot;Trim Easy,&quot; &quot;Ecstasy&quot; and 
&quot;Bliss&quot; at rock concerts or hip clothing boutiques and 
&quot;Ephedra&quot; in health food stores.[8] It can be found in some new 
herbal sodas. Bodybuilders also use it for short-term energy boosts.

<p>

In 1988, Congress passed the Chemical Diversion and Trafficking
Act, which imposed controls on bulk ephedrine powder. Thereafter,
meth producers sought international sources and began to switch
to pseudoephedrine as their source chemical.

<p>

Meth can be &quot;cooked&quot; by amateurs with a few simple chemicals
in makeshift labs. Some of these labs can produce up to 100 pounds
at a time. In February 1995, Mexican authorities seized a lab
that could produce 2,640 pounds of meth a month.[9]

<p>

Even a makeshift lab can take $4,000 in raw ingredients and produce
eight pounds of meth worth more than $50,000 on the street.[10] Besides
the danger of arrest for producing illegal substances, lab mistakes
can be catastrophic.

<p>

On Christmas Day, 1995, a mobile home near Aguanga, California
burst into flames. Three children died and an out-of-control meth
kitchen was blamed.[11]

<p>

Authorities busted 419 clandestine labs in California in 1994,
and the deadly environmental residue from these labs cost that
state more than $1 million in clean-up.[12] Although the number of
meth lab seizures rose to 683 in 1989, they dramatically declined
with new laws restricting ephedrine's availability.[13] Today, the
number of labs is rising once again as alternative ephedrine sources
have been found.

<p>

<center><h3>WHO USES METH?</h3></center>

<p>

Meth is tailor-made for the fast-paced 1990s. It helps suppress
the appetite, gives self-confidence, provides an extended feeling
of euphoria, and provides &quot;Energizer&quot; levels of get-up-and-go.

<p>

Kathy Paddock, a services coordinator for Terros, an Arizona-based
drug and mental health rehabilitation center, said, &quot;We're
seeing young people in their teens, young adults, everyone. It's
the drug of the '90s. People are needing to go fast -- alter their
moods. The meths are replacing crack.&quot;[14]

<p>

One study found that 75 percent of meth users were employed white
men between the ages 25 and 35.[15] Robert Booth, a psychiatry professor
at Colorado University's medical school, says meth attracts middle-class
housewives with too much to do.[16] <I>The U.S. News &amp; World Report</I>
describes meth users as white, 18-to-34-year-old working class
people, &quot;some of them gay and many of them women.&quot;[17]

<p>

Ed Mayer, head of the narcotics enforcement team in Jackson County,
Oregon, says meth is &quot;cheaper [than cocaine] and it gives
people a longer high.&quot;[18] That's why it is growing in popularity,
especially among adolescent girls who want to lose weight and
boys who use it as a sexual stimulant.[19]

<p>

<center><h3>THE NEW METH EPIDEMIC</h3></center>

<p>

Just how bad is the meth &quot;epidemic&quot; and what are the
consequences? Consider:

<p><ul>

<li>The Department of Justice reports that meth abuse has risen
between 500 and 800 percent among young adults over the past five
years.[20]

<p>

<li>The nation's medical examiners report a 144 percent rise in
meth-related deaths from 1992 to 1994.[21] There were 1,816 meth-related
deaths reported from 1991 to 1994.[22] Eighty percent of these were
reported in just <i>four</i> big western cities.[23]

<p>

<li>Meth-related hospital emergency room admissions have risen
366 percent over the last 10 years in California.[24] In some local
areas they have risen 1,742 percent.[25] The problem is so bad that
in one California hospital meth babies now outnumber crack babies
by as much as seven to one.[26]

<p>

<li>In Phoenix, meth-related crimes have jumped 400 percent in
the last three years.[27] Officials believe meth is largely responsible
for a 40 percent jump in Phoenix's 1994 homicide rate. Phoenix's
law enforcement authorities also report spending 60 percent of
their time working on cases involving meth.[28]

<p>

<li>In Contra Costa County, near San Francisco, police say that
meth was involved in 89 percent of domestic disputes.[29] San Diego
County reports that meth detections among arrestees rose from
23 percent in 1991 to 45 percent in 1994.[30]

<p>

<li>Authorities in San Diego and the San Francisco Bay area report
nearly 3,000 admissions to treatment programs for meth. This is
up from only 600 in 1988.[31]

<p>

<li>Meth is making inroads elsewhere. Of 100 women recently booked
into the Minneapolis jail, 75 had meth traces in their urine.[32]
In Tacoma, Washington, police report that meth-related homicides
are on the rise.[33]

</ul><p>

Recognizing the critical nature of the coming tidal wave of meth
abuse, on March 12, 1996, Senator Diane Feinstein (D-Calif.) introduced
legislation aimed at curbing the manufacturing of methamphetamine.
The Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996, which has bipartisan
support, tightens federal regulation and reporting requirements
for the chemicals used to produce meth, and increases criminal
penalties for possession of the relevant chemicals or equipment
with the intent to manufacture the drug.

<p>

Public officials are nearly unanimous in condemning meth and warning
Americans about its likely impact. Attorney General Janet Reno
warned, &quot;There should be no question...in anybody's mind
that methamphetamine poses a real and serious threat to the citizens
of our nation.&quot;[34]

<p>

Drug Enforcement Administration head Thomas A. Constantine told
a U.S. House Judiciary subcommittee: &quot;I am concerned that
this coming epidemic could not happen at a worse time. Our nation
has not yet fully recovered from our cocaine experience, and powerful
traffickers in Mexico are seeking to make their mark on history
in much the same way the Cali Mafia did.&quot;[35]

<p>

Dr. Andrew Mecca with the California Alcohol and Drug Programs
participated in a meth study which found &quot;that we have got
a dramatic rise or epidemic level of occurrence.&quot;[36]

<p>

John Coonce, the meth task force chief for the DEA, said, &quot;We're
seeing more [meth] labs in middle American. It's an epidemic that's
getting worse.&quot;[37]

<p>

<center><h3>DRUG TRAFFICKERS FIND METH BETTER THAN CRACK</h3></center>

<p>

Today, meth is available in large quantities. Last year about
170 tons of ephedrine was converted into 136 tons of meth, which
was sold on U.S. streets for about $3.2 billion. That's enough
meth to supply 12.4 million abusers with three 10-milligram doses
a day for 365 days a year.[38]

<p>

Meth production and distribution have become a big business. In
the 1970s, meth was largely the province of motorcycle gangs.
But in the 1980s making meth from ephedrine became an easy and
lucrative alternative to processing and selling cocaine. It became
attractive because domestic traffickers could cut out middlemen
like the Colombian cartels.

<p>

There are three categories of meth traffickers. Those who traffic
in the raw materials -- primarily ephedrine or pseudoephedrine
-- to producers, those who peddle the finished product, and those
who do both.

<p>

The raw material traffickers either operate domestically or internationally.
The domestic operators divert legal ephedrine to meth lab operators.
For example, Clifton Pharmaceuticals in western Pennsylvania imported
large quantities of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine powder last
year. From the powder they made pills, which were then sold through
three mail order firms located in Florida and Kentucky. The DEA
routinely seized these products in clandestine meth labs in California.[39]

<p>

Ephedrine tablets were sold through mail order distributors in
100 and 1,000-count bottles through magazines like <I>Cosmopolitan,
High Times</I> and <I>Hustler</I>.[40] They were advertised as 
bronchodilators, energy boosters or diet aids. This practice has now been 
slowed by the 1990 Domestic Chemical Diversion Control Act, because the
DEA can now deny registration to companies whose actions are deemed
to pose an imminent threat to public health and safety. Unfortunately,
the Food and Drug Administration has yet to reclassify pseudoephedrine
as a controlled substance.

<p>

Mexican drug organizations are the primary traffickers in raw
ephedrine. They ship large quantities of ephedrine from India,
China and the Czech Republic into Mexico and then either make
meth at local labs or smuggle it into the U.S. For example, in
1994, 3.4 tons of ephedrine traveling from Zurich to Mexico City
was seized by the customs service at Dallas-Fort Worth International
Airport.[41]

<p>

Mexican finished-product traffickers have so saturated the Western
meth market as to depress its street value. In 1991, a pound of
meth cost $6,000, but today the price has been cut in half.[42] That
makes meth a real psychedelic bargain when compared to crack cocaine.
For example, $20 can buy a quarter gram of meth or one-tenth of
a gram of crack or one-sixteenth of a gram of heroin.[43]

<p>

<center><h3>HOW TO HEAD OFF THE COMING EPIDEMIC</h3></center>

<p>

This country needs a three-part, balanced strategy to stop the
meth epidemic. This strategy must include strong enforcement,
prevention, and effective meth-abuse treatment with accountability.
Enforcement begins with the right laws. Congress already has laws
that tightly control the sale of ephedrine powder, but should
consider more restrictions on the over-the-counter sale of pseudoephedrine
tablets. Feinstein's proposal closes a loophole in the Controlled
Substances Act by removing an exemption for pseudoephedrine. It
also adds needed restrictions on other chemicals used to produce
methamphetamine. Meth producers can now make cash purchases of
large quantities of red phosphorus, iodine and hydrochloric gas
-- chemicals used to make meth. There are no uniform reporting
requirements or quantity limitations for these chemicals.[44]

<p>

The pending bill would restrict access to these chemicals and
impose a civil &quot;three-strikes-and-you're-out&quot; law for
companies that are found to be selling chemicals used to make
meth. It will also increase the maximum criminal penalty for those
who possess equipment used to manufacture meth.

<p>

The second part of an effective meth-abuse prevention strategy
is to reduce demand through more effective education about the
drug's ruinous effects, which include hallucinations, addiction,
depression, paranoia and violent rages. This effort should be
spearheaded by private, non-profit groups involved in drug education
at both the national and grass-roots levels.

<p>

Finally, the strategy must include effective treatment. Treatment
funds must be controlled at the point of delivery where local
officials best understand the problem. These programs must last
long enough to give the addicts a fighting chance to recover,
and addicts must be held strictly accountable for their progress.

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

The methamphetamine epidemic is poised to become much worse than
the crack epidemic. Meth is cheaper, can be domestically produced
and gives the abuser a higher high that lasts much longer than
crack cocaine. Meth's downside is that it can make the abuser
incredibly violent, thus further fueling the nation's crime epidemic.
Now is the time for parents, school teachers, citizen groups,
law enforcement, government officials, church leaders and others
to act in concert to ward off this scourge before it accelerates
into overdrive, leaving millions of devastated citizens in its
wake.

<title>UNPRECEDENTED SURGE IN FUTURE YOUTH CRIME PREDICTED</title>

<p>

<h2>UNPRECEDENTED SURGE IN<br>
FUTURE YOUTH CRIME<br>
PREDICTED</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>

<p>

Violent crime was down 5 percent in the first half of 1995 and
murder dropped 12 percent. This was the largest drop in the murder
rate in years and six times larger than the drop the year prior.[1]

<p>

Some experts attribute the decline to a combination of the aging
of baby boomers, police anti-drug gang efforts and the stabilization
of drug-related turf battles. Alfred Blumstein, a professor at
Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, observes, &quot;In large
cities, the [drug] markets are most mature. Drug markets started
later in smaller cities, later still in rural areas.&quot;[2] Drug-related
violence may now be shifting to suburbia.

<p>

Thus, Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Fla.), Chairman of the House Judiciary
Subcommittee on Crime, worries that these latest crime statistics
&quot;will give us a false sense of security.&quot;[3] He's not alone.

<p>

Kansas City Mayor Emanuel Cleaver said, &quot;We...have absolutely
no idea why we are experiencing such a precipitous drop [in the
murder rate].&quot;[4] There were 26 percent fewer murders in the
first half of 1995 than the same period the prior year. New York
City's crime rate registered its steepest drop in 23 years.[5]

<p>

Amidst the good news, FBI Director Louis Freeh notes that violent
crime involving young people, both as perpetrators and victims,
is on the rise. &quot;The number of juveniles arrested for weapons
offenses has more than doubled over the past decade,&quot; Freeh
said.[6]

<p>

On a typical day in 1994, nine teenagers in the U.S. were murdered
and 13 teenagers committed a murder.[7] A profile of Justice Department
murder arrest rates by age provides a sobering story. In 1965,
23-year-olds were arrested more often for murder than any other
age group, and their rate was 33 per 100,000 23-year-olds. In
1992, 18-year-olds were arrested more often for murder and their
rate was 97 per 100,000 18-year-olds. That's a 467 percent increase
in murder arrests for 18-year-olds.[8] The trend is toward younger
offenders and higher arrest rates.

<p>

In addition, many experts believe that within the next decade
America will experience an unprecedented surge in youth crime.[9]
According to Attorney General Janet Reno, the problem of children
killing will only worsen because demographics show the key at-risk
population -- 14- to 17-year-olds -- will increase significantly
in years to come.[10]

<p>

<center><h3>WHAT CONTRIBUTES TO THE UPSURGE IN THE NUMBER OF 
YOUNG MURDERERS?</h3></center>

<p>

Social scientists cannot show cause-and-effect relationships for
murder. But they can demonstrate that certain conditions highly
correlate with the increase in juvenile violence.

<p>

<li><b>Parental absence increases a child's likelihood of future
criminal behavior.</b>

<p>

As out-of-wedlock birth has risen, so has the crime rate. Forty-three
percent of all inmates grew up in a single-parent household. Nearly
a third had parents who abused either alcohol or drugs, and more
than a third had at least one family member who was ever incarcerated.[11]

<p>

Cato Institute Chairman William Niskanen said, &quot;A one-percentage-point
increase in births to single mothers appears to increase the violent
crime rate about 1.7 percent.&quot;[12] And a 1990 study by June O'Neill,
a professor with Baruch College of the City University of New
York, shows that men from single-parent families are twice as
likely to commit crimes compared to men from two-parent families.[13]

<p>

Robert Sampson, professor of sociology at the University of Chicago,
notes that it is harder for single-parent families to achieve
the &quot;informal social controls&quot; that limit both crime
and victimization within a community. &quot;There are higher crime
rates in places where communities are not characterized by strong
families,&quot; Sampson said. &quot;The research has been fairly
consistent showing a small-to-moderate positive relationship between
individual delinquency and family breakdown.&quot;[14]

<p>

Even children from two-parent homes suffer when both parents are
absent most of the day due to outside jobs. About 31 million children
under age 15 live with 19 million mothers employed outside the
home. Mothers who work full-time outside the home are four times
more likely to have unsupervised (latchkey) children than moms
who work part-time.[15] This is important, according to a Justice
Department study. It concluded that parental supervision, attachment
to family, and consistency of discipline were the most important
barriers to delinquency and drug abuse.[16]

<p>

Likewise, a study in <I>Child Development</I> found that the fundamental
causes of delinquency are consistent across time and rooted in
generic family processes such as supervision, attachment, and
discipline. This study also found that teenagers whose mothers
who are employed outside the home are more likely to become delinquent
than teenagers whose mothers who are not employed outside the
home. Most adolescents in the low-supervision category (83 percent)
were delinquent compared to 10 percent of those in the high-supervision
category.[17]

<p>

Another study in the <I>Journal of Social Work</I> entitled, &quot;Parenting
in Poverty,&quot; found that for children growing up in very disadvantaged
and violent neighborhoods, the one factor that seems to protect
the child from growing up to be violent is having a parent who
supervises the child very strictly.[18]

<p>

The National Institute of Justice found that being neglected as
a child increases the likelihood of arrest as a juvenile, as an
adult, and for violent crime.[19] This was especially true for juvenile
girls. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
20 percent of male and female runaways marked parental neglect
as a primary factor for their leaving home.[20]

<p>

Metropolitan Life's 1993 national survey found that teachers (71
percent) and law enforcement officials (90 percent) agree that
the lack of parental supervision at home is a major contributing
factor to violence in schools.[21]

<p>

<li><b>Drug use is highly correlated with delinquent behavior,
and use among adolescents is on the rise.</b>

<p>

A 1994 survey by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) found
that the rate of marijuana use among eighth-graders rose from
6 percent in 1991 to 13 percent in 1994. A similar trend is evident
among 10th- and 12th-graders. Adolescent abuse of cocaine, crack,
heroin, and LSD is also rising.[22]

<p>

Andrew Peyton Thomas, Arizona assistant attorney general and former
NAACP counsel, writes in <I>Crime and the Sacking of America</I>,
&quot;There is...an undeniable relationship between crime and
drugs. Drug addiction can both lower inhibitions among offenders
and spur them on to other crimes to finance their dependency.&quot;
He argues that in spite of the synergism of crime and drugs, analysts
cannot conclude that drugs cause crime. In fact, drugs &quot;do
not ingest themselves.... Drugs reach their human hosts only after
being invited.&quot;[23]

<p>

A Justice Department study of 4,000 urban youths over a five-year
period identified a pattern leading to delinquency.[24] The study
found a direct connection between drug use and delinquency. By
age 16, half of the youth surveyed were using alcohol regularly
and one-quarter were using marijuana.[25]

<p>

The study also found that delinquency starts early. Ten percent
of the 7-year-old boys surveyed reported having committed at least
one street offense. By age 9, the figure was 20 percent and by
17 years of age, 40 percent of the boys had committed at least
one crime.[26]

<p>

<li><b>Most Americans blame the pop culture for increases in youth
violence.</b>

<p>

According to the Family Research Council's 1995 nationwide poll
(conducted by Voter/Consumer Research, a Maryland-based pollster),
more than nine of every 10 Americans believe the media affects
violent crime at least a little.

<p>

Robert McAffee, president of the American Medical Association,
agrees. He said, &quot;If you combine television, motion pictures,
rap music and video games, there's a continuing influence of 
violence....[and] violence is indeed a learned behavior.&quot;[27]

<p>

Senator Bob Dole (R-Kan.) echoed McAffee's view, saying, &quot;Those
who continue to deny that cultural messages can and do bore deep
into the hearts and minds of our young people are deceiving themselves
and ignoring reality.&quot;[28] He called for a boycott of Columbia's
film <I>Money Train</I> following a copycat incident where two
men sprayed flammable liquid through the slot of a Brooklyn subway
token booth, holding a match in the window and seriously burning
the agent inside. The man died several days later.

<p>

But many of Hollywood's elite deny the relationship. Only 30 percent
of media's elite told <I>U.S. News &amp; World Report</I> that
violence in the media contributes to the level of violence in
America.[29] For example, Richard Jewell, a professor in the School
of Cinema-Television at the University of Southern California,
says that Dole's attack is unfair. &quot;The biggest difficulty
with politicians like Dole is that they oversimplify things to
such an extent that we lose sight of the real issues: drugs, families
coming apart, all sort of things that go far beyond media presentation,
Jewell said.&quot;[30]

<p>

But Joel Federman, research director for Mediascope, a Studio
City, Calif.-based public policy group isn't so defensive. He
acknowledges that television violence plays a small but significant
role in promoting more aggressive behavior.[31]

<p>

Robert Butterworth, a Los Angeles-based child psychologist, says
that the average child watches 100,000 acts of television violence
and witnesses 8,000 television murders before the end of elementary
school.[32] This much violence has an effect.[33]

<p>

According to an analysis of 275 studies, George Comstock, the
S.I. Newhouse Professor of Public Communication at Syracuse University,
says that perhaps 10 percent of antisocial and illegal acts can
be linked to television.[34]

<p>

Psychologist Leonard Eron of the University of Michigan's Institute
for Social Research has tracked the television viewing habits
of 650 New York children from 1960 to the present. Those who watched
the most violent programming grew up to be the most aggressive
and crime prone-adults.[35]

<p>

In 1995, the UCLA Center for Communication Policy reviewed numerous
television violence studies. The studies consistently found that
children who view media depictions of aggression became more violent
in their own behavior.[36]

<p>

The National Institute of Mental Health reported that the consensus
in scientific literature is that exposure to television violence
increases children's physical aggressiveness. Senate Judiciary
Committee member Paul Simon (D-Ill.) said he found &quot;nearly
3,000 scholarly articles and studies on the harmful effects of
television violence on children and adults.&quot;[37]

<p>

Murder, which is defined by the FBI as &quot;the willful killing
of one human being by another,&quot; is an aspect of many television
films.[38] Consider these 1995 TV movie titles:

<p>

<I>Death in Small Doses</I> (ABC), <I>Deadline for Murder: From
the Files of Edna Buchanan</I> (CBS), <I>Fatal Vows</I> (CBS),
<I>A Killer Among Friends</I> (CBS), <I>Love Kills: Sweet Justice</I>
(NBC), <I>A Menu for Murder</I> (NBC), <I>The Moment of Truth:
Murder or Memory?</I> (NBC), <I>Marked for Death</I> (CBS), <I>Death
Becomes Her</I> (NBC), <I>The Silence of the Lambs</I> (CBS),
and <I>Falling for You</I> (CBS).

<p>

While television impacts juvenile violence and murder, no one
knows precisely how much. But there are those willing to speculate.
For example, epidemiologist Brandon S. Centerwall told <I>Newsweek</I>
that without television there would be 10,000 fewer murders per
year, 70,000 fewer rapes and 700,000 fewer assaults.[39]

<p>

The music industry shares some of the responsibility. Dr. Joseph
Stuessey, professor of music history at the University of Texas,
told the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, &quot;Music affects behavior.
This simple fact has been known intuitively for centuries....In
the 20th century, especially in the last four decades, tons of
research has been done on the interrelationship of music and human
behavior....It affects our moods, our attitudes, our emotions,
and our behavior. It affects us psychologically and 
physiologically.&quot;[40]

<p>

Child and adolescent psychiatrist Dr. Robert Demski identifies
music as one of the most powerful influences on youth.[41]

<p>

Dr. Sheila Davis, a professor of lyric writing at New York University,
states that songs &quot;are more than mere mirrors of society;
they are a potent force in the shaping of it....[P]opular songs...provide
the primary 'equipment for living' for America's youth.&quot;[42]

<p>

Pop culture's music is laden with violence. It has themes about
murder, maiming, raping, abusing, and destroying. Rap and heavy
metal are the worst, but others contribute to the promotion of
violence. Some examples of violence-promoting lyrics:

<p><ul>

<li>The Dead Kennedys sing &quot;I Kill Children.&quot; The lyrics
include: &quot;I kill children, I love to see them die. I kill
children to make their mothers cry.&quot;

<p>

<li>Rigor Mortis sings &quot;Bodily Dismemberment.&quot; The lyrics
include: &quot;My fetish is a crime....With five easy slices you're
in six lovely pieces. Bodily dismemberment as passion increases.&quot;

<p>

<li>Blood Feast has a song &quot;Kill for Pleasure&quot; and Motley
Crue has a song &quot;Bastard&quot; about killing someone with
a knife.

</ul><p>

<center><h3>COMING CRIME WAVE</h3></center>

<p>

There are some clear-cut social and demographic trends that make
it very probable that today's shocking stories of youthful violence
will explode over the next decade.

<p>

By the year 2005, the number of teens aged 15 to 19 will increase
by 23 percent and a larger proportion of these teens will be coming
from homes without fathers. Given the correlation between father
absence and crime, some experts estimate that violent crime like
murder could increase to 40,000 killings per year -- that's up
60 percent from the current toll.[43]

<p>

James Q. Wilson, professor of management at the University of
California, Los Angeles and co-editor of the book <I>Crime</I>,
said, &quot;So we should expect, unless something changes dramatically,
that the [now lower] crime rate will go back up.&quot;[44]

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

Americans perceive that crime is getting worse. This may seem
out of line with recent crime statistics, but the changing face
of crime has made citizens feel less safe. Young thugs are now
the threat, and the danger is likely to increase. Defusing the
coming youth time bomb should be a major priority for all levels
of government.

<title>SOLDIER FALLS ON HIS SWORD TO WAKE UP AMERICA</title>

<h2>SOLDIER FALLS ON HIS SWORD TO<br>
WAKE UP AMERICA</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Lieutenant Colonel Robert L. Maginnis (U.S. Army, Ret.)</i></center>

<p>

A courageous soldier has become a pawn in a complex national debate
involving the constitutional separation of powers, foreign policy,
and military law. In the end, America must exercise great caution
when deciding these weighty issues.

<p>

Specialist Michael G. New, a former homeschooler and son of Christian
missionaries, refused to wear a blue beret and a United Nations
(U.N.) patch on his U.S. Army uniform because, he believes, it
violates Army uniform regulations and his enlistment oath which
was to &quot;support and defend the Constitution of the United
States,&quot; not the U.N.

<p>

Specialist New's unit, based in Germany, was alerted last summer
for a peacekeeping mission to the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia (FYROM). His commander ordered a pre-deployment inspection
which included the requirement for all soldiers to appear in formation
wearing their U.S. uniform augmented with a U.N. shoulder patch
and a blue beret. New contends this was an illegal order.

<p>

In August, New told his sergeant that he would disobey an order
to wear the U.N. accouterments on his uniform. After consulting
with his military legal counsel, a chaplain, he flew home from
Germany to discuss his alternatives with his father, his civilian
attorney and congressional representatives. As a result of these
discussions, he decided to disobey the order.

<p>

Specialist New knows that soldiers are expected to obey lawful
orders, and an order to report to duty in a prescribed uniform
is generally a lawful order. However, the government and New disagree
about the Army's authority to prescribe a uniform that includes
the U.N. accouterments.

<p>

In October, after failing to appear in the prescribed uniform,
New was charged with failure to obey an order and offered non-judicial
punishment. Because of his deep conviction on this issue, New
refused non-judicial punishment and asked for a court-martial,
even though this subjected him to potentially much severer punishment
if convicted.

<p>

Specialist New has chosen to fall on his sword to propel onto
the national scene the debate over America's involvement in U.N.-sponsored
peacekeeping missions. This debate ought to be waged by politicians
rather than depending on the martyrdom of an individual soldier.

<p>

<center><h3>THE U.S. MISSION IN MACEDONIA</h3></center>

<p>

Some question the legality of the Macedonian mission. Their concern
centers around the interpretation of the U.N. Charter, which the
U.S. Senate consented to ratify on July 28, 1945 and which was
signed by President Harry Truman on October 31, 1945.

<p>

U.S. Army forces have participated in the ongoing United Nations
Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP) in FYROM as &quot;Task
Force Able Sentry&quot; since July 1993. President Clinton argues
that the Macedonian mission is authorized by Section 2, Clause
1, Article II of the U.S. Constitution which establishes the President
of the United States as the Commander in Chief of the Army and
Navy. In fact, he vetoed the 1996 Defense Authorization Act, in
part, because of his belief that Congress was trying to infringe
upon his authority as Commander in Chief to &quot;assign U.S.
Armed Forces under United Nations operational or tactical 
control.&quot;[1]

<p>

The President has both the constitutional and statutory authority
to employ the armed forces in order to &quot;further U.S. national
interests.&quot; By statute -- Section 7 of the United Nations
Participation Act (22 US Code 287d-1) -- the President may detail
U.S. military personnel to U.N. peacekeeping operations under
Chapter VI of the U.N. Charter to serve as observers, guards,
or in any other noncombatant capacity. Further, under Section
628 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, upon appropriate presidential
determination, U.S. personnel may be assigned or detailed to international
organizations to serve with the international staff of such organizations
or to provide technical, scientific, or professional services
to them.

<p>

The Clinton administration argues that the UNPREDEP was established
as a peacekeeping operation under Chapter VI (Pacific Settlement
of Disputes) of the U.N. Charter, which would mean that the presence
of U.S. troops serving in FYROM is authorized by law. Specialist
New and numerous members of Congress disagree with the administration's
analysis. They contend that this is a Chapter VII (Action with
Respect to Threats to the Peace, Breaches of the Peace, and Acts
of Aggression) mission and is illegal because it was not approved
by Congress.

<p>

On October 6, 1995, 44 members of Congress signed a letter citing
New's case to President Clinton, seeking answers to questions
about America's involvement in U.N. peacekeeping operations. They
asked whether U.S. intervention is in the &quot;national interest,&quot;
if constitutional procedures were respected in the decision to
deploy American troops, and if Americans will be under the command
of foreign officers.[2]

<p>

This politically charged debate illustrates a classic separation
of powers dispute and must be resolved before more Americans are
assigned to U.N. missions.

<p>

<center><h3>THE U.N. IS BECOMING MILITARIZED</h3></center>

<p>

The U.N. has experienced a renaissance with the precipitous fall
of the Soviet Union, rising from near impotence in the early 1980s
to worldwide peacemaker in 1995. This transition has been marked
both by a change in operational philosophy and the expansion of
a blue-helmeted legion of peace-enforcers.

<p>

There is little doubt that the U.N. would not exist today if it
were not for U.S. membership and support. The American taxpayer
has paid a disproportionate part of the U.N. budget. The recent
surge in U.N. military operations should concern American policymakers.

<p>

The U.N. operational philosophy and military role have radically
changed. In the U.N.'s first five years, it launched only two
peacekeeping missions. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the
U.N. has mounted 19 operations involving more than 70,000 blue-helmeted
soldiers. Last year these operations cost $3.6 billion. Of this,
the U.S. was directly assessed $1.2 billion by the U.N., and the
Clinton administration spent another $1.7 billion for U.S. military
participation in U.N. missions. Today, thousands of American soldiers
wear U.N. blue helmets in 10 countries ranging from Haiti to Lebanon
to the former Yugoslav republics.

<p>

The U.N. has dramatically expanded its use of military forces
in peacekeeping operations. The U.N. Department of Peacekeeping
has expanded from a staff of 23 to more than 350 with a modern
situation center, staffed 24 hours a day, linked electronically
to all U.N. hot spots. It has a standby system to tap troops and
equipment from 185 member nations, and it has established a storage
base in Italy to stockpile equipment such as armored personnel
carriers for rapid deployment to peacekeeping missions.[3]

<p>

The United States Senate has the constitutional authority and
obligation to determine whether continued American membership
in the U.N. serves a useful purpose. A significant question is
whether the militarization of the U.N. is in this country's best
interests.

<p>

<center><h3>CLINTON ADMINISTRATION LIKES THE U.N.</h3></center>

<p>

In 1994, the Clinton administration issued Presidential Decision
Directive 25 on reforming multilateral peacekeeping operations.
This was supposed to make them more selective and more effective.
The directive claims, &quot;The U.S. does not support a standing
U.N. Army, nor will we earmark specific U.S. military units for
participation in U.N. operations.&quot;

<p>

Despite this assurance, White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry
has said that President Clinton supports America's continued U.N.
involvement[4] and Madeleine K. Albright, U.S. Permanent Representative
to the United Nations, told Congress, &quot;The Clinton administration
believes very deeply in the potential of the U.N. system.&quot;[5]

<p>

The Clinton administration has supported the U.N.'s radical transformation,
but some Americans don't share this optimism. Presidential hopeful
Senator Bob Dole (R-Kan.) has said, &quot;It is high time we rein
in U.N. peacekeeping, which is out of control.&quot; Senator Jesse
Helms (R-N.C.) has called the U.N. &quot;the nemesis of millions
of Americans.&quot;[6]

<p>

These are early warning signs that must not be ignored. History
teaches that the acquisition of military power traditionally has
been the first step toward establishing governance over a territory.
Coupling the U.N.'s changing military strength with the new operational
philosophy favoring individual over state sovereignty sends a
warning shot across the bow of free people around the world.

<p>

<center><h3>NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AT RISK</h3></center>

<p>

Franklin D. Roosevelt envisioned the U.N. dealing with traditional
interstate aggression rather than the types of internal conflict
that now dominate. But the 50-year-old organization is transitioning
to the &quot;new world order.&quot; That change is echoed by U.N.
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who has issued <I>An
Agenda for Peace</I> suggesting a greatly expanded U.N. peacemaking
role. He endorses the principle of &quot;universal sovereignty&quot;:
&quot;Underlying the rights of the individual and the rights of
peoples is a dimension of universal sovereignty that resides in
all humanity and provides all peoples with legitimate involvement
in issues affecting the world as a whole.&quot;

<p>

Boutros-Ghali has used this concept to sanction U.N. efforts in
Somalia, saying, &quot;The magnitude of the human tragedy constitutes
a threat to international peace and security.&quot; Thus, he justified
the world body's intervention in the sovereign affairs of a nation-state
without invitation. The same happened in Iraq after the Gulf War.

<p>

Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait posed a classic situation for the
U.N. It was a case of aggression in which the armies of one state
crossed international borders to invade another. Desert Shield/Storm
was a successful international effort to reject the invaders and
restore the sovereignty of Kuwait. The subsequent 1991 U.N.-sanctioned
incursion into northern Iraq to protect the Kurds (Operation Provide
Comfort), however, was the first time the Security Council authorized
the use of force in the strictly internal affairs of a member
state. Thus began a potentially dangerous new era for U.N. 
&quot;peacemaking.&quot;

<p>

&quot;Loose constructionists of the U.N. Charter believe the existence
of such problems justifies expanding U.N. jurisdictions to deal
with them,&quot; says former U.S. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick,
who warns, &quot;We are slipping into practices which enhance
only the power of the strongest. Is this what we want to do? Someone
had better think through this question -- and soon.&quot;[7]

<p>

But Boutros-Ghali awards supremacy of rights to individuals and
groups within countries. He argues that &quot;the centuries-old
doctrine of absolute and exclusive sovereignty no longer stands.&quot;
Apparently, then, outside forces do have a right to trump national
sovereignty. Does this, then, mean or imply that true sovereignty
resides with the U.N., individual nationhood be damned?

<p>

The U.N.'s implied &quot;right&quot; to intervene in the sovereign
affairs of a country leaves all member countries vulnerable including
the U.S. For example, the next time Korean-Americans bear the
brunt of a Los Angeles riot, the South Korean government could
ask the U.N. to intervene to protect its citizens' rights. It
couldn't happen now because the U.S. would veto the move procedurally
and militarily. But it could happen in the future, especially
if the U.N. has a standing military governed by a liberal world
elite.

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

The national debate fostered by Specialist New's case is important.
It comes at a time when American troops are involved in peacekeeping
missions around the world. It has taken the courageous act of
one soldier to highlight an issue that deserves serious debate
and resolution.

<title>MILITARY HOMOSEXUAL CASES RACE TO THE SUPREME COURT</title>

<h2>MILITARY HOMOSEXUAL CASES<br>
RACE TO THE SUPREME COURT</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Lieutenant Colonel Robert L. Maginnis (U.S.A., Ret.)</i></center>

<p>

Two military homosexual cases are now competing for a Supreme
Court hearing. Both cases have already been heard at the appellate
court level, and decisions are expected by the summer.

<p>

These cases are complicated by major differences between the congressional
law concerning homosexuality in the armed forces (Defense Authorization
Act of 1994, 10 U.S.C. &#167; 654) and the regulations issued
by the Clinton administration to implement this law (DoD Directive
1332.14 and 1332.30).[1]

<p>

These differences include:

<p><ul>

<li>As passed by Congress, the law forbids service by homosexuals.
The Clinton regulations permit service by &quot;celibate&quot;
homosexuals and drop the principled and unambiguous statement
that &quot;homosexuality is incompatible with military service.&quot;

<p>

<li>The law requires the discharge of people with a propensity
to engage in homosexual conduct. The Clinton regulations redefine
propensity to mean the narrow term &quot;likelihood.&quot;

<p>

The law relies on commander discretion to initiate investigations.
The Clinton regulations create a &quot;criminal-like&quot; standard
before investigations can be initiated. According to Secretary
of Defense William Perry, attending gay pride parades, frequenting
gay bars, and possessing gay materials are not &quot;credible&quot;
evidence to initiate an investigation. In addition, the Clinton
regulations hinder military criminal investigators from investigating
private consensual sexual misconduct (sodomy and adultery).

<p>

<li>The law forbids homosexual service for readiness reasons.
But contrary to 200 years of military practice, Clinton's Defense
Department no longer considers homosexual behavior a marker for
increased security risk. Information discovered during a security
investigation cannot be used for adverse action without permission
from high-level political appointees.

</ul><p>

<center><h3><i>ABEL ET AL. V. U.S.A.</i></h3></center>

<p>

The Family Research Council filed a friend-of-the-court brief
in the first federal challenge to the military's homosexual policy.[2]
The case involves six avowed homosexuals who allege that the military's
policy violates their First and Fifth Amendment rights.

<p>

This case was filed in 1994 shortly after the congressional law
took effect. The plaintiffs skirted the military's normal administrative
process and went straight to federal court seeking a preliminary
injunction (PI) barring the military from discharging them until
their constitutional challenge was resolved. The government sought
relief from the PI via the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2d Circuit,
and was granted that motion, forcing the lower court to hurry
up the hearing.

<p>

In March, 1995, <I>Abel et al. v. U.S.A.</I> was heard by Judge
Eugene Nickerson of the Eastern District of New York. Lambda Legal
Defense and Education Fund and the American Civil Liberties Union
represented the homosexual service members. They called six 
&quot;expert&quot; witnesses to refute the military's claim of a 
constitutional right to exclude homosexuals. Curiously, Clinton Justice 
Department lawyers did not counter any of these witnesses with expert 
testimony from defenders of the ban.

<p>

In addition, the Justice Department failed to:[3]

<p><ul>

<li>Present well-documented arguments for denying homosexual service
based on physical and psychological problems.

<p>

<li>Demonstrate that the policy is conduct-based rather than status-based
as the plaintiffs argued.

<p>

<li>Show that homosexual &quot;lifestyles&quot; and &quot;values&quot;
are contrary to the best interests of the armed services and present
serious morale and unit cohesion problems.

<p>

<li>Refute a flawed study cited by the plaintiffs as evidence
that homosexuals will not damage morale and unit cohesion.

<p>

<li>Demonstrate that homosexuals present a risk to the military.

</ul><p>

The plaintiffs complain that the government violated their First
Amendment rights when it tried to discharge them based on their
homosexuality. The government argued that this is not a First
Amendment issue because the law and the policy are directed solely
at the prohibition of acts and give members the opportunity to
rebut the presumption of misconduct. However, the government failed
to show a nexus between a declaration of homosexuality and homosexual
misconduct. In fact, government lawyers labeled much of the available
evidence as &quot;myths,&quot; thus aiding the plaintiffs.

<p>

The government argued that heterosexual service members &quot;will
be upset by a co-worker's mere statement of homosexuality&quot;
and as a result refuse to work cooperatively. Judge Nickerson
found for the plaintiffs.[4] He labeled the discrimination unjustified
and noted key differences between the congressional law and the
Clinton policy:

<p><ul>

<li>Although the law permits asking about homosexual acts and
orientation at the point of admission, the Clinton administration
has rejected such questions. The judge labeled this as unusual.
On one hand the Pentagon encourages homosexuals to join (by not
making homosexuality part of a pre-induction litmus test) and
then insists that the homosexual remain secretive about his 
&quot;status.&quot;

<p>

<li>The law denies service to homosexuals, but the policy permits
service to admitted homosexuals who can rebut the presumption
that they will engage in homosexual misconduct. This creates a
status/conduct dichotomy. The judge labels the rebuttable presumption
as &quot;Orwellian&quot; because the government failed to show
a connection between a declaration of homosexuality and misconduct.
The judge understandably concluded &quot;that the admission of
homosexuals did not pose an uncontrollable risk that they would
commit acts inherently dangerous to morale, good order, and 
discipline....&quot;

</ul><p>

Nickerson explained that his task &quot;is to determine the constitutionality
of the policy [read law] adopted by Congress, not its morality.&quot;
He argues that everyone is &quot;entitled to think it demeaning
and unworthy of a great nation to base a policy [read law] on
pretense rather than on truth.&quot;

<p>

Nickerson's decision was appealed by the government to the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan. The hearing
was set for December 19 but was postponed due to unusual circumstances.

<p>

The night before the hearing, a letter was faxed to one of the
judges from the Justice Department. It reminded Judge Guido Calabresi
that back in March 1993 he had signed a letter to Congress maintaining
that legislation banning homosexuals from the military was unconstitutional.
At the time he co-signed the letter with 118 other lawyers, Judge
Calabresi was the dean of the Yale Law School. He was appointed
by President Clinton to the federal bench in 1994.

<p>

Calabresi's letter says, &quot;The ban on military service by
lesbian, gay and bisexual Americans violates the most basic premise
of equal protection law: that all similarly situated persons should
be treated alike.&quot;[5]

<p>

The judge recused himself from the case the morning of the scheduled
hearing. The case was rescheduled with a new panel and heard on
January 16, 1996.

<p>

At that hearing, Chief Judge John M. Walker Jr., a Bush appointee,
demonstrated an understanding of the law's intent. &quot;If you
say you're a homosexual,&quot; Walker said, &quot;in order to
rebut the presumption, you can't be a homosexual. A person is
either joking, mistaken, lying or expressing vague desires, as
opposed to propensity.&quot;[6]

<p>

Deputy Solicitor General Kneedler urged the court to &quot;rely
on the policy,&quot; which rationally allows a superior to address
an issue. He noted that the policy works and explained that seven
avowed homosexuals have already rebutted the presumption of conduct
and have been allowed to continue serving. Finally, he recommended
overturning the lower court's decision because the homosexual
members failed to exhaust administrative challenges before taking
their case to court.[7]

<p>

Matthew A. Coles, of the American Civil Liberties Union, argued
that the military has no right to ban either homosexual acts or
their speech. He also challenged the reasoning behind the idea
that homosexuals should have to rebut the presumption that they
will engage in homosexual acts.[8]

<p>

Judge Pierre Leval asked Coles to respond to a parallel situation.
Leval posed the question, what would the military do if someone
declared himself a white supremacist? Coles said the military
would do nothing. But the judge argued that at least the military
would investigate to determine whether the individual intended
to act on his beliefs.[9]

<p>

<center><h3><i>THOMASSON V. PERRY</i></h3></center>

<p>

FRC had the rare privilege to make oral arguments before the Fourth
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., in the case of
<I>Thomasson v. Perry</I>.[10] Lt. Paul G. Thomasson is an avowed
homosexual who petitioned the court to declare the military's
ban unconstitutional. FRC defended the law while the Justice Department
hid behind the Clinton administration's faulty policy.

<p>

This case has followed an unusual track. It began on March 2,
1994, the day Thomasson wrote a letter to his boss at the Bureau
of Naval Personnel in Arlington, Virginia. The letter contained
the declaration, &quot;I am gay.&quot; A Navy administrative board
discharged him June 15,1994 for homosexuality. Thomasson never
admitted to homosexual conduct and failed to rebut the presumption
of misconduct.[11]

<p>

He subsequently filed a motion for relief with the U.S. Federal
Court for the Eastern District of New York asking the court to
declare the military's policy unconstitutional. U.S. District
Judge Claude M. Hilton ruled that the policy was constitutional
upholding Thomasson's honorable discharge. Thomasson's appeal
of that decision was then heard by a three-judge panel from the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Alexandria, Virginia.[12]

<p>

On September 12, 1995, at the appeals court hearing, one of the
judges said the Clinton administration has a &quot;problem&quot;
in defending its &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; policy on homosexuals.
It does not match the intent of Congress.[13]

<p>

Judge J. Michael Luttig told Deputy Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler,
who argued that the Clinton policy is constitutional, &quot;I
think you've got a problem in the government's case.&quot; He
accused the administration of using the policy to make an &quot;end
run&quot; around the Congress.[14]

<p>

All three judges roundly criticized the policy scheme, in particular
the attempted distinction between &quot;orientation&quot; and
&quot;propensity.&quot;[15]

<p>

Allan Moore, Lt. Thomasson's attorney, told the court that the
policy and law violate the constitution's guarantees of free speech
and equal protection. Moore labeled the policy &quot;an Orwellian
concept.&quot; He rejects the notion that the statement, &quot;I
am gay,&quot; presumes misconduct. He argued that the statement
is nothing more than an admission of identity or status.[16]

<p>

Judge Luttig posed a hypothetical case to Mr. Kneedler. What if
I claim to be a communist? Can I rebut the government's presumption
that I will engage in communist activities? The judge then skipped
to the homosexual case. &quot;Okay to think, 'I'm gay,' but can't
say so. But if I say it, I must persuade the decision-maker that
I won't do gay things.&quot; The relationship between &quot;status&quot;
and &quot;propensity&quot; consumed most of the oral argument.[17]

<p>

After the hearing, the three judges signed an order saying they
wanted the full court to rehear the case. At this point, FRC filed
a motion to make oral arguments and, in an unusual move, the court
granted that motion.[18]

<p>

On December 5, the 13 judges of the U.S. Appeals Court for the
Fourth Circuit reheard the case in Richmond, Va. Once again, Judge
Luttig took a conservative stance. He said, &quot;It seems to
me...the Navy is concerned with conduct and not speech.&quot;
Judge Paul V. Niemeyer joined in, &quot;I'm just wondering why
this is a speech case at all.&quot;[19]

<p>

Judge Harvie Wilkinson III said, &quot;Don't we have here a case
where statements are used for evidentiary value, and the First
Amendment never prohibits statements for whatever evidentiary
value they may have?&quot;[20]

<p>

Professor William Woodruff, the Army's former chief of litigation
and now a law professor at Campbell University in North Carolina,
argued for FRC. He explained that the Clinton regulations are
inconsistent with the law. He also pointed out that the old policy
was codified in the new law and declared that the intent of the
law was a classwide bar, that is, homosexuals cannot legally serve.
He called for a faithful execution of the law.

<p>

A decision favorable to conservatives is expected by late spring.
That decision will be in competition with <i>Abel</i> for an appeal to
the Supreme Court this summer.

<p>

<center><h3>RELATED ISSUES</h3></center>

<p>

Other homosexual cases are winding their way through the federal
court system. However, either <I>Thomasson</I> or <I>Abel</I>
will most likely be heard by the high court. That decision will
become a landmark for future homosexual litigation such as the
rising tide of homosexual marriage and adoption cases.

<p>

Meanwhile, in August, 1995, Defense Department general counsel
Judith Miller wrote a memo to the military services which spells
out what to do with those service members who say they are homosexual
and what they must do to remain on active duty.[21] This memo followed
the publicized case of Navy Lieutenant Commander Maria Z. Dunning,
who successfully rebutted the presumption by promising not to
engage in homosexual misconduct.[22]

<p>

The memo gave confused commanders better guidance on proceeding
through the homosexual policy thicket. In spite of the latest
clarification, the number of homosexual discharges are up. From
October 1994 to September 1995, the military services discharged
722 members for homosexuality, a 21 percent increase from the
1994 figure of 597 discharges.[23]

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

No matter which case or combination of cases reaches the Supreme
Court, FRC will file a friend-of-the-court brief and a motion
to make oral argument before the justices. Given past history,
it's reasonable to expect the Clinton Justice Department to under-argue
the case that goes to the high court and, hopefully, FRC's clear
voice defending the law will be heard.

<title>THE IMPACT OF ROMER v. EVANS</title>

<h2>THE IMPACT OF <i>ROMER v. EVANS</i></h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<i>Robert H. Knight</i></center>

<p>

On May 20, 1996, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional
Colorado's Amendment 2 to the state constitution, which had prohibited
the state and local jurisdictions from adding &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
to minority protection statutes.  The amendment, approved by a
majority of voters in 1992,  was drafted after several Colorado
cities -- Denver, Boulder, Aspen and Aurora -- had enacted statutes
adding &quot;sexual orientation&quot; to the list of protected
civil rights, thus affording homosexuals a vehicle to use civil
rights law in discrimination claims.

<p>

Amendment 2's sponsors viewed this &quot;special&quot; protection
to homosexuals as a threat to those who believe that homosexuality
is wrong and not a valid category for heightened protection heretofore
reserved for genuinely-disadvantaged minorities.

<p>

In a 6-3 ruling,[1] the court disagreed, saying that Amendment 2
violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to
the Constitution because the state could not prove a &quot;rational
basis,&quot; that is, a &quot;legitimate legislative end&quot;
for denying homosexuals &quot;the possibility of protection across
the board.&quot;  Thus, the Supreme Court affirmed the earlier
ruling of the trial court and the Colorado Supreme Court in striking
down Amendment 2.

<p>

<center><h3>WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS RULING?</h3></center>

<p>

It sweeps aside the right of the people to amend their own state
Constitution, at least with regard to homosexuality.  The court,
in effect, said that it, and it alone, will determine which groups
can be considered &quot;disadvantaged&quot; when they lose a statewide
ballot issue.  By this reasoning, any state that has outlawed
polygamy has &quot;disadvantaged&quot; polygamists by making it
unlawful for them to enact legalization of polygamy at the local
level.  In his forceful dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia addressed
this particular absurdity:  &quot;Has the court concluded that
the perceived social harm of polygamy is a 'legitimate concern
of government,' and the perceived social harm of homosexuality
is not?&quot;

<p>

Homosexual activists now have a guarantee that their opponents
will be prevented ever from rescinding &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
laws at the state level.  Homosexual activists can work to get
&quot;gay rights&quot; laws on the books, but no group of voters
is allowed ever to rescind them at the state level.

<p>

The court's decision has not technically created a brand new class
of specially-protected citizens:  homosexuals.  But no other group
has that kind of heightened protection except for those that have
been designated as &quot;suspect&quot; classes in need of special
protections.  No court -- including the current Supreme Court
-- has ever designated homosexuals as a &quot;suspect class.&quot;

<p>

The cultural impact may be greater than the legal implications.
<I>The New York Times'</I> lead headline on May 21 proclaimed,
&quot;Gay Rights Laws Can't Be Banned, High Court Rules.&quot;
Although technically the ruling only applies to state laws that
bar passage of new gay rights laws, <I>Romer v. Evans</I> was
hailed as a repudiation of any efforts to delay consolidation
of the homosexual agenda.  Within hours of the decision, the Supreme
Court's ruling was cited by an attorney in a lesbian parenting
dispute in Florida, who proclaimed that the high court had outlawed
the use of sexual orientation as a factor in child custody cases.
The court did no such thing, but we can expect more of the same
sweeping interpretations to be used to sway a reeling culture
that has been force-fed homosexual propaganda for the past decade.
As Suzanne Goldberg of Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund
exulted after the decision, &quot;Because the court so clearly
rejected anti-gay sentiment, it plants the seeds for future decisions
rejecting anti-gay decisions in many other areas.&quot;[2]

<p>

<h4>Wasn't this a victory for tolerance of gay and lesbian people?</h4>

<p>

No. Homosexuals have achieved enormous tolerance and are now
seeking state-mandated acceptance of their behavior.  The <I>Romer
</I> decision was a defeat of the Colorado people's desire to create
a level playing field with regard to civil rights.  A majority
of Coloradans passed Amendment 2 so that people who disagree with
the homosexual activist movement would not be subjected to discrimination
in &quot;gay rights&quot; jurisdictions such as Aspen, Denver,
Boulder and Aurora.  As Justice Scalia put it in his dissent,
&quot;The only denial of equal treatment [the Court] contends
homosexuals have suffered is this:  They may not obtain preferential
treatment without amending the state constitution.&quot;  He also
said, &quot;The Court has no business imposing upon all Americans
the resolution favored by the elite class from which the members
of this institution are selected, pronouncing that animosity toward
homosexuality...is evil.&quot;  Note that Justice Scalia did not
say animosity toward homosexuals.  In singling out the behavioral
characteristic in question, Scalia correctly reflected the Christian
view of loving the sinner but hating the sin. The state should
never give preferential treatment on the basis of  behavior that
has been discouraged in all major cultures for thousands of years
and by all major religions.

<p>

<h4>The court cited some previous case law in its decision.  Isn't
this a well-founded ruling?</h4>

<p>

The court, indeed, cited some cases in which legal protections
have been extended to particular groups that are not officially
&quot;suspect&quot; classes but are &quot;identifiable&quot; groups.
But, overall, the opinion was so legally impoverished that it
had to be fashioned, as Scalia remarked,  &quot;so long on emotive
utterance and so short on relevant legal citation.&quot;  The
court's opinion fails to address <I>Bowers v. Hardwick</I>, the
1986 case in which the court ruled that there is no constitutional
protection for homosexuality.  So if it is legal to criminalize
the act of sodomy, then why can't a state decline to extend special
protections for a class of people whose only defining characteristic
is that they practice sodomy?

<p>

<h4>Doesn't Amendment 2 take away the civil rights of homosexuals?</h4>

<p>

No. It just prohibits the addition of special rights that others
do not have.  As Justice Scalia wrote, &quot;The Colorado Amendment
does not, to speak entirely precisely, prohibit giving favored
status to people who are homosexuals; they can be favored for
many reasons -- for example, because they are senior citizens
or members of racial minorities.  But it prohibits them favored
status <I>because of their homosexual conduct</I>....(italics
in original)&quot;

<p>

In other words, homosexuals were in no danger of losing any civil
rights despite press accounts that incorrectly say that Amendment
2 &quot;strips homosexuals of their civil rights.&quot;  They
just could not gain new rights based solely on their predilection
to practice homosexuality.

<p>

<h4>The court ruled that no rational basis could be found to justify
Amendment Two.  What's wrong with that?</h4>

<p>

Ignoring numerous examples of how &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
protections can be wielded against ordinary citizens, the court
essentially concluded that the Colorado people's sole reason for
enacting Amendment 2 was an &quot;animus&quot; toward homosexuals.
This means the court is calling more than 800,000 Coloradans
&quot;hate-filled bigots&quot; and declaring that they had no
rational basis whatever for approving the amendment.  It also
means that God-fearing people in all major religions who believe
homosexuality is wrong are now deemed to be outside the realm
of decency.  This is a sweeping condemnation of the deeply-held
beliefs of billions of people around the world.

<p>

<h4>The court said that gay rights are not &quot;special rights.&quot;
Why do you say they are?</h4>

<p>

Homosexuals have the same rights all citizens have.  They have
the same redress that all citizens have if they face discrimination.
They want an extra level of preferential treatment that would
allow them to cite their homosexuality anytime they do not get
what they want -- a job, a promotion, whatever.  People who commit
adultery do not have such a right.  People who abuse drugs do
not have such a right.  In fact, nobody else has the right to
insist that their behavior is irrelevant to an employer.  &quot;Gay
rights&quot; laws are a massive club with which to beat everyone
else into acceding to homosexuals' increasingly strident demands
for mandated acceptance.  As social critic David Frum writes,
&quot;Antidiscrimination law may invoke the language of rights
and freedoms, but its true function is to shrink the ambit of
freedom in order to promote equality.  The landlady who does not
want to rent an apartment to a tenant whose habits and friends
frighten her; the hardware store owner who wants to hire someone
he regards as trustworthy -- new antidiscrimination rules shrink
even further the liberty of these people to use their property
as they see fit or to hire whom they like.&quot;[3]

<p>

<h4>Can you give some examples of this?</h4>

<p><ul>

<li>In Ontario, Canada, the mayor of Hamilton was personally fined
$5,000 for running afoul of that city's human rights ordinance
that includes sexual orientation.  His crime?  He declined to
issue a special proclamation that the city would celebrate a &quot;gay
pride week.&quot;[4] The mayor in no way threatened the rights of
homosexuals, but was personally punished for failing to use his
city office to celebrate homosexuality.

<p>

<li>The Boy Scouts of America have been under severe legal attack
by homosexual activists in states that have &quot;gay rights&quot;
laws.[5] Their crime? They updheld their 80-year-old moral tradition
that bans openly homosexual men from becoming leaders over young
boys.

<p>

<li>In San Fernando, California, Superior Court Judge John Farrell
was told by other judges in 1995 that he should quit his activities
as a parent volunteer for the Boy Scouts or resign from the bench.
His crime?  The Scouts &quot;discriminate&quot; on the basis
of sexual orientation, which is a protected category under California's
&quot;gay rights&quot; law. A proposed judicial rule would also
ban participation by judges in any group that discriminates on
the basis of sexual orientation.  So Farrell's volunteer work
with the Boy Scouts is a violation of  &quot;judicial ethics.&quot;[6]

<p>

<li>In Seattle, Washington, a small-business employer, Bryan Griggs,
was hauled before the city's human rights board.  His crime?
He allegedly violated the rights of a homosexual employee whom
he had laid off.  The employer did not know the employee was gay.
The employer had had to lay off the entire staff during a downturn.
The employee's claim to &quot;discrimination&quot; consisted
of his employer's playing Christian talk radio on which ads for
the business were running (this constituted a &quot;hate&quot;
crime), posting a letter from a Congresswoman regarding the 
gays-in-the-military issue, and having a note on his desk that he wrote 
to himself regarding homosexuals and adoption of children.  After spending
thousands of dollars defending himself, Griggs saw the case finally
dismissed for lack of substance.[7]  But the point was made to other
employers --  mess with any homosexual employee or would-be employee
and you will be legally harassed.

</ul><p>

<center><h3>SUMMARY</h3></center>

<p>

In striking down Amendment 2, the court ignored a wealth of case
law, twisted the meaning of the Constitution, ignored the reality
of homosexual behavior, and intervened heavily on the side of
homosexual activism against those who believe that homosexuality
is wrong.

<p>

Justice Scalia summed up the case by writing, &quot;Today's opinion
has no foundation in American constitutional law, and barely pretends
to.  The people of Colorado have adopted an entirely reasonable
provision which does not even disfavor homosexuals in any substantive
sense, but merely denies them preferential treatment.  Amendment
2 is designed to prevent piecemeal deterioration of the sexual
morality favored by a majority of Coloradans, and is not only
an appropriate means to that legitimate end, but a means that
Americans have employed before.  Striking it down is an act, not
of judicial judgment, but of political will.&quot;

<p>

In the face of an increasingly strident homosexual rights movement,
the court has declared war on the beliefs of millions of ordinary
Americans.

<p>

This is the real message of &quot;gay rights&quot; -- affirm what
we do or we will use legal means to harass you.  Americans who
want to stay neutral will soon find that this is a stance that
homosexual activists -- and now the Supreme Court -- will not
afford them.

<h2>TURNING HEARTS<br>
TOWARDS THE OFFICE</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

The good news is, being a &quot;family-friendly&quot; corporation
is now considered <I>in</I> by professionals in the field of human
resources.  The bad news is, this new family-friendliness does
<I>not</I> include empowering one parent to support a family on a
single income. Instead, what it means is domestic partner benefits,
on-site day care, business support for intrusive &quot;home visit&quot;
schemes such as Missouri's &quot;Parents as Teachers&quot; program,
and helping new mothers &quot;return to work&quot; (the words
imply that child-rearing is a leisure activity) as soon as possible.

<p>

This is the conclusion this writer reached after attending a two-day
conference entitled, &quot;The 1996 Work and Family Conference:
Is the Family a Corporate Stakeholder?&quot;  The conference
was sponsored jointly by the Conference Board, a leading organizer
of business conferences, and the Families and Work Institute,
a grantee of the U.S. Department of Education.  The conference
was underwritten by Johnson &amp; Johnson and IBM, and was held
in New York City in late April.

<p>

<center><h3>COMPANIES THAT &QUOT;GET IT&QUOT;</h3></center>

<p>

The first panel of speakers was called &quot;Family Values in
a Corporate Context.&quot;  Andrew D. Sherman, vice president
of the benefits consulting firm The Segal Company, said his company's
criterion for family benefits eligibility is &quot;two adults,
not related by blood, in a relationship that is non-platonic,
financially linked, and intended to be permanent.&quot;

<p>

Providing such benefits has been very inexpensive, in part because
only about 1 percent of Segal's employees have chosen to enroll as 
domestic partners.  According to Sherman, this makes domestic partner 
benefits a &quot;win-win&quot; for his company: Its gets praise for its
enlightenment at very low cost.

<p>

The only question, he asked, is why more companies do not offer
such benefits? Sherman's answer was that many CEOs don't &quot;get
it.&quot;

<p>

Detailing other companies policies, Sherman noted that Xerox includes
extended family members as well as domestic partners.  Lotus offers
domestic partner benefits to same-sex couples <I>only,</I> on
the theory that opposite-sex couples 
can acquire those benefits by marrying.  Lotus's aim, Sherman
said, is to be known as &quot;the employer of choice for talented
people of all descriptions.&quot;  Kodak offers benefits to same-
and opposite-sex couples, because of its self-image as a &quot;progressive
and innovative corporation,&quot; Sherman said.

<p>

Wendy Starr, a consultant in the field of &quot;work-family programs,&quot;
and a former human resources executive at Xerox, said the human
resources field has matured from the shuffling of benefits paperwork
to &quot;support of the total person.&quot;  This mandate is all
the more extensive, she noted, because in the field of  benefits,
notions of legal marriage are giving way to &quot;a variety of
significant people.&quot;

<p>

Xerox, whose CEO &quot;gets it,&quot; defines &quot;extended family&quot;
for benefits purposes as those who reside in the employee's home,
are financially dependent on the employee, are not eligible for
benefits elsewhere, and are related to the employee as domestic
partner (same- or opposite-sex), parent, parent-in-law, grandparent,
grandparent-in-law, or child.  (Missing from the list is &quot;spouse,&quot;
but one assumes that not even Xerox has taken the step of affirmatively
penalizing the married.)

<p>

Perhaps the goal of &quot;supporting of the total person&quot;
which many of today's human resources specialists are suggesting
is overreaching.  Laura Nash, who teaches business ethics at Boston
University's School of Management and School of Theology, suggested
the possibility at one time, in her book <I>The Nanny Corporation</I>.
In her Work and Family Conference presentation this year, however,
Nash seemed more concerned with assuring attendees that she is
not really that far off the reservation.

<p>

What happens in the employee's family, she said, affects the company.
The really &quot;progressive&quot; companies are driven by non-economic
values such as &quot;dignity&quot; and &quot;universal access&quot;
-- though she admitted it is difficult to point to shareholder
value created by such policies.

<p>

&quot;You are progressively changing the face of the social fabric,&quot;
Nash told the assembled human resources professionals.

<p>

One could argue that companies should just pay salaries, and not
get into employees' lifestyles, she said, but employers have legitimate
concerns about how employees will spend the extra money.  On the
one hand, conformity and dependence are dangerous, but on the
other, employers want healthy employees, not employees with poor
health and a Porsche.

<p>

Christian C. Kjeldsen, Johnson &amp; Johnson's vice president
of corporate staff, spoke glowingly of his company's on-site day
care centers.  The one at the company's headquarters has 200 children,
and there is a waiting list!  Johnson &amp; Johnson aims to build
to more centers, Kjeldsen said.

<p>

In a stunning illustration of the power of the print media in
elite circles, and an equally stunning illustration of contemporary
corporate values, Kjeldsen noted that the problem of proving the
bottom-line benefits of extensive employee benefits (including
on-site day care) never came up at his company.  The reason? 
<I>Forbes</I> and <I>Business Week</I> ran articles about changing
demographics.  That was all the proof  his company's management
needed to make on-site day care and other benefits a permanent
fixture even through downsizing, &quot;rightsizing,&quot; and
early-outs. In other words, Johnson &amp; Johnson was
building programs to enable mothers to work for them and warehouse
their children, even while it was eliminating programs -- i.e.,
<I>jobs</I> -- that enabled workers to provide for their families
without recourse to day care.

<p>

After a while one sensed that all the cheerleading for &quot;progressively
changing the face of the social fabric&quot; was coming mainly
from the presenters, while the audience had more mundane concerns,
such as getting sanity back into their lives and the lives of
the employees they were supposed to be taking care of.

<p>

Someone from the audience asked Kjeldsen whether all this paternalism
was not perhaps in direct conflict with what they heard at last
year's Work and Family Conference, which focused on the decline
of dependable employment and the consequent need for portable
benefits.  Kjeldsen looked uncomfortable and said that &quot;companies
still have a lot of control over who is and who isn't at a desk.&quot;
Perhaps Kjeldsen's meaning was that Johnson &amp; Johnson, like
many other companies, sees extensive benefits as a recruitment
and retention issue and that the function of those benefits is
to convince prospective and present employees that a corporate
&quot;social contract&quot; still exists, even though none does.

<p>

<center><h3>&QUOT;OUTDATED&QUOT; PERSONNEL POLICIES</h3></center>

<p>

Randall Tobias, CEO of  the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly,
said in the event's keynote address that although some argue that
taking care of the family is not something that should be done
within the walls of the corporation, he disagrees.

<p>

The problem, Tobias said, is that many managers have an &quot;outdated&quot;
view of the family, which is why so many U.S. companies have personnel
policies &quot;based on Ozzie and Harriet.&quot;  Tobias claimed
such a family structure accounts for only 18 percent of employees
in the U.S.

<p>

Eli Lilly has changed with the times, Tobias said.  It is building
an on-site day care center for 220 children.  Its cafeteria prepares
take-home dinners four nights a week.  Other available benefits
include dry cleaning, and a 24-hour counseling service.  &quot;The
child care facility,&quot; said Mr. Tobias, &quot;will benefit
not only the families that use it, but all our employees, stockholders,
customers -- all who benefit from the <I>undivided attention</I>
of our employees.&quot; (Emphasis added)

<p>

Are we perhaps recreating the dreaded &quot;company town&quot;
from a bygone and unlamented era of U.S. labor relations?  Tobias
is not concerned.  &quot;You're kidding yourselves,&quot; he said,
&quot;if you think you can tell employees to leave their problems
at the factory fence.  You cannot hire <I>part</I> of a human
being.&quot;

<p>

Eli Lilly's employees seem to agree.  According to Tobias, the
company's internal surveys show that its employees do not see
the company's policies as intrusive.  They feel they are being
made more productive, and are glad to be part of an effective
corporation.  Human resources today, he said, requires attention
to the &quot;entire lives of our employees,&quot; and its professionals
must help &quot;break down the barriers to change.&quot;

<p>

After lunch, I chose to attend a session featuring Donna Klein,
a human resources executive with Marriott International.  I wondered
if perhaps Marriott's Mormon ownership would lead it toward more
traditional forms of family-friendliness.

<p>

Interestingly, what Marriott is doing is not exactly traditional.
At its headquarters in Atlanta,  Marriott has gotten together
with other hotel chains to establish Atlanta's Inn for Children,
a &quot;family center&quot; for low-income members of the &quot;hospitality
profession.&quot;  It is a 250-slot day care center that also
provides immunization, parent education, and nutrition counseling.

<p>

Marriott has also set up an Associate Resource Line (ARL), which
combines an &quot;employee assistance program&quot; with a 
&quot;case-management approach.&quot;  In other words, the hotel company 
brings the social work profession fully into the private-sector workplace.
In fact, Klein said this decision was made based on the fact
that some of Marriott's managers were spending more than half
of their time on social work rather than with business management.

<p>

In fairness to Marriott, their work force gives them an unusually
pressing need to bring social work into the workplace.  The company
has a high percentage of immigrant employees, many of whom need
help integrating into American society.  For instance, the ARL
has, to date, administered counseling in 15 different languages.
Still, one cannot help but be startled at the breadth of issues
that Marriott now considers to be workplace-related, including
housing, marital problems, and school problems.

<p>

Why have more companies not gone the way of Marriott?  Klein had
a simple explanation:  The wives of their CEO's &quot;don't work.&quot;

<p>

At this session, the audience was on board.  One participant praised
Marriott for having &quot;got religion&quot; on the need to subsidize
&quot;working mothers.&quot;

<p>

&quot;To some extent,&quot; Klein said, &quot;we are just rearranging
our overwork.  Still, better to overwork flexibly than inflexibly.&quot;

<p>

I left that first day remembering an old <I>New Yorker</I> cartoon
in which guests are being announced as they arrive at an ultra-posh
reception.  The butler/herald calls out:  &quot;The Duke and Duchess
of Exxon.  The Earl and Countess of Kodak.  The Marquis and Marchioness
of Glaxo,&quot; etc., etc.  Just as that cartoonist envisioned,
corporate leaders are the aristocracy of today, and they are very
serious about the paternalistic doctrine of &quot;noblesse oblige.&quot;
Whether this is good for the family as institution is another
question.

<p>

<center><h3>NO LONGER SUBSIDIZING THE FAMILY</h3></center>

<p>

A panel on &quot;Corporate Implications of the Fatherhood Debate&quot;
featured William Galston, professor of philosophy and public policy
at the University of Maryland.  Risking the opprobrium of the
mainly-female audience, Galston noted that the surge of women
into the paid work force over the past forty years has coincided
with the replacement of the &quot;military&quot; model of life,
left over from World War II, by the &quot;self-expression&quot;
model.  The result, he said, is that the family is weaker than
ever.

<p>

Galston saw a limited, but real role for the corporation.  It
can ease, but not eliminate, the tension that men feel between
work and home.  Corporate culture should change so that men do
not feel they are endangering their chances of promotion -- or
even of surviving a downsizing -- if they show by their actions
that they take their family responsibilities seriously.

<p>

Kathleen Gerson, professor of sociology at New York University,
was much more optimistic about the state of the family.  Men face
more economic insecurity than before the gender-role revolution,
Gerson said, but that very insecurity gives them the opportunity
to discover that &quot;motherhood and fatherhood are not very
different.&quot;

<p>

Gerson declared that the gender-role revolution is irreversible.
Women in the workforce and &quot;fluidity of marriage,&quot;
she said, are two of the immovable pillars of the new order.

<p>

Those who want to keep corporations out of people's lives fail
to understand those changes, Gerson said.  Companies used to subsidize
an unsalaried caregiver at home by paying the breadwinner (usually
the husband/father) a sufficient salary, she said, but because
of today's  &quot;irreversible&quot; social changes, corporations
must now take responsibility for their employees' whole well-being.

<p>

<center><h3>EMPLOYERS AS TEACHERS</h3></center>

<p>

The conference press kit included a glossy booklet entitled <I>Employers,
Families, and Education</I>, which was produced by the Fatherhood
Project at the Families and Work Institute.  The booklet covers
a variety of topics, including recommendations on how businesses
can provide family-friendly policies such as flextime, working
at home, and paid time-off for parent-teacher conferences.  These
are packaged, however, as ways of  &quot;making family involvement
in learning a goal&quot; and &quot;encouraging employees to get
involved in their children's schooling&quot; -- evidently assuming
that most parents are utterly unconcerned about their children's
education until given a nudge by their employers.

<p>

This assumption is carried forward in many of the specific recommendations
in the booklet.  One section touts an eight-hour &quot;parenting
seminar&quot; created by the U.S. West Education Foundation, and
available for purchase by human resource professionals for use
with their employees.  &quot;Interactive exercises and structured
discussion groups aim to give parents the understanding, confidence,
and skills they need to become positively involved in their children's
education.&quot;  One does not get the impression that parents,
as such, are viewed in a very positive light by the emerging 
corporate-business &quot;partnership&quot; in education.

<p>

The very next paragraph of the Families and Work Institute's booklet
touts the &quot;Parents as Teachers&quot; program, which, despite
the Orwellian choice of words in its name, assumes that 
parents lack even the most basic skills for bringing up their
children, never mind being their children's teachers, and therefore
need ongoing supervision by social workers.  Here is the entire
paragraph verbatim:

<p><blockquote>

<i><b>Parents as Teachers (PAT).</b> A home-school-community partnership
program designed to support parents of children from birth to
age 5 through home visits by parent educators, parent support
groups, and a referral network.  Established originally by four
school districts in Missouri, PAT is now mandated as a service
in that state, and has been replicated in hundreds of other school
districts around the country.  Scott Paper sponsors PAT in two
communities, IBM sponsors it in five, and Honeywell has adapted
the program for its own employees.</i>

</blockquote><p>

Employers, Families and Education was &quot;developed under contract
to the U.S. Department of Education.&quot;  The same notice specifies
that it does not necessarily reflect the views of the Department
of Education, even though Secretary Richard Riley's name appears
on the title page.

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

As shown by the above-quoted text, and by many of the presentations
at the Work and Families Conference, it would be a great mistake
to assume that everything that is &quot;private sector&quot; is
necessarily free from bureaucracy, institutionalized patronization,
and a control-mentality.

<p>

While some of the initiatives discussed at this conference are
no doubt helpful and commonsensical, others are intrusive, paternalistic,
and more or less explicitly aimed at undermining the traditional
family by subsidizing alternatives to it.  These are offenses
that we generally associate with the overweening state.  But private
industry is likely to work hand-in-glove with government in the
campaign for direct access to our children, whom industry views
exclusively as tomorrow's employees and consumers.

<p>

Robert E. Allen, CEO of AT&amp;T, says it better than I could
in a quote prominently featured in <I>Employers, Families, and
Education</I>:

<p><blockquote>

<i>We have not traditionally linked the well-being of children to
the success of business or the governance of nations.  Yet increasingly 
we're acknowledging that upheavals in the American family aren't 
self-contained -- they intersect with business and economic circles 
and loop into the social fabric of this nation. As a society, we 
assume a larger affiliation -- one that implies, not just family 
ties, but added obligations.</i>

</blockquote><p>

This view would be less threatening if it were less accurate.
Anyone who recognizes that family breakdown has consequences
beyond the particular family in question deserves applause.  The
problem comes when we reduce those consequences to their impact
on &quot;business and economic circles,&quot; and then imply that 
they signify the failure of the family as such, and a consequent 
need to deploy &quot;a larger affiliation.&quot;
