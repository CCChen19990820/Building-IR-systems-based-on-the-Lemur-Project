<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on Straight Talk we are celebrating a belated 
Father's Day.  Unfortunately, fatherhood cannot claim the 
revered position it once held in our national culture.  Not 
only do many television sitcoms make a mockery of fathers, 
but the harsh reality is that thousands upon thousands of 
America's children suffer from the absence of their own 
fathers.

<p>

Our guests tonight, who are actively researching 
and attempting to change the status of fatherhood in our 
country, will discuss the fatherhood crisis and the triumphs 
and trials of being fathers themselves. 

<p>

But first, let's hear from Family Research Council 
president Gary Bauer.  As the Presidential election draws 
near, Bob Dole and Bill Clinton are raising issues and 
debating them with America's leaders. 

<p>

In the last two weeks, Gary has been in the 
forefront of those discussions as they have played out on
the front pages on the <i>New York Times</i> to the mass media.
The present controversy has involved the sanctity of life
and the politics of abortion.  Let's hear what Gary has to
say about recent events and upsets as we take you Behind the
Headlines.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gary, thank you so much for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.

<p>

For a lot of people who watch this show and who 
follow the Family Research Council and actually you, in 
particular, they have seen over the last two weeks 
incredible media exposure from <i>Capital Gang</i> to <i>Crossfire</i> 
to the front page of the <i>New York Times</i>. The debate has been 
about Dole and abortion, the Republican Party and the right-
to-life issue.  How would you characterize the debate as it 
stands today? 

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, I think it has been actually a 
frustrating week or two in the sense that the debate has 
gotten away from 1.5 million unborn children being aborted 
every year and has now, at least it seems inside Washington, 
gotten down to dotting I's and crossing T's in the platform. 

<p>

The issue is one of the most profound issues 
facing the country, and it deserves a more noble debate than 
a debate over the machinations of a platform committee. 

<p>

The irony is that there is this tremendous 
difference between Bob Dole and Bill Clinton on the issue.  
The President, as we all know, supports abortion on demand.  
He has even vetoed a bill that tried to limit abortions in 
the eighth and ninth months of pregnancy.  Bob Dole has a 
35-year pro-life voting record. 

<p>

So my hope is that Senator Dole will just be clear 
about that so that the American people can discern what the 
differences are between the two men. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The media likes to write process 
stories, particularly about difficult issues like abortion 
and right to life.  In the last two weeks, we have seen a 
lot of coverage on the Republican platform and whether there 
should be language on tolerance or the big tent in the 
preamble or attached to the plank itself. 

<p>

But really, it is not that simple, as simple as a 
platform.  Why, in a way, is this story a big story, and 
then why is it really not as significant as they are trying 
to make the process of the platform out to be? 

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, look.  When you take a so-called 
tolerance line, which I think is a sort of bizarre way to 
say that something in your platform doesn't really mean what 
it says, but when you take that and apply it only to the 
abortion issue, the message you are sending is that you are 
really not serious about doing anything on abortion. 

<p>

The best analogy I can come up with is taxes.  The 
Republican platform will predictably say that they want 
lower taxes.  I certainly hope that they will say that.  If 
they added language to that plank that said, "However, we 
know some people disagree with us, and they are welcome in 
the party, too," the clear message the American people would 
get is, Whoops, tax aren't going down; the party is not 
serious about that issue. 

<p>

And, likewise, if you single out the abortion 
issue, which is a very profound issue, very important for 
the future of the country and who we are as a free people, 
and you add only tolerance language to that, then the 
message you are sending is that the issue really isn't that 
high on your priority list, and you are really not going to 
do anything about it. 

<p>

I think it eliminates one of the major 
vulnerabilities that Bill Clinton has.  I think he is 
extremely vulnerable in this issue if somebody will really 
take the debate to him and be clear and articulate about it. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That really is an incredible irony. 
Here we have a radically pro-abortion Democratic Party and 
the most liberal, most extreme pro-abortion President of all 
history, who embraces abortion in the seventh, eighth, and 
ninth month, even if the child is perfectly healthy, and we 
have a pro-life candidate with a 35-year voting record and a 
consistently pro-life party.  But why do you think the 
Republicans are reluctant to embrace what has been a winning 
issue?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, I think the main reason is the 
way this city thinks about the abortion issue.  In 
Washington, D.C., the cultural elite of the city is 
overwhelmingly pro-abortion, whether you are talking about 
the media, the political consultants that hang on and make 
their living by telling candidates what they ought to say 
and not say, the pollsters, and so forth. 

<p>

So every major politician is constantly being told 
(that) to be pro-life is an impediment.  And when you get 
out around the country and look at who gets elected, pro-
life people do extremely well.  That is one of the reasons 
we have a Republican majority in the Congress now for the 
first time since World War II.  It is one of the reasons the 
Republicans won five out of the last seven Presidential 
elections. 

<p>

You know, Kristi, the real irony here is that 
polling data out just in the last couple of days show that 
about 30 percent of the American people think that Bill 
Clinton only supports abortion in the first three months of 
the pregnancy.  This is unbelievable to me.  Here in 
Washington, we all know that President Clinton -- he is very 
about this:  he believes in abortion on demand.  There is no 
restriction on abortion in any month of the pregnancy, for 
any reason, that Bill Clinton has been willing to sign.  And 
yet because there is never a real debate on it, one-third of 
the American people think that he wants abortion fairly 
stringently restricted. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The media likes to characterize 
abortion as a women's issue, which is ironic, because in 
polling women consistently are shown to be more pro-life.  
And if we look at people who are single-issue voters, the 
abortion issue, in terms of the right-to-life position, 
pulls 2 to 1 as an advantage for a candidate who takes that 
issue.

<p>

Why do you think, though, that the media tries to 
say abortion is a gender gap issue for Dole? 

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, no, it is not responsible at 
all; in fact, this poll is no surprise.  There has not been 
one poll in 20 years of polling -- and I have looked for 
every one of them -- that has ever shown that it is the 
abortion issue that costs a politician or a party female 
votes, because as you just indicated, on balance it ends up 
being a net plus for whatever candidate or party takes that 
position. 

<p>

I think the gender gap has got a lot to do with 
some of the budget cuts which the Republican Party 
legitimately tried to make, but polling data for years has 
also shown that women tend to get nervous when you are 
talking about cutting budgets, particularly when the 
programs being cut have some indirect effect on women or 
children or the elderly or the sick.  And that is 
understandable.  Women tend to be more sensitive about those 
sorts of things.  So I think that the economic cuts, the 
economic agenda of the party, has a lot more to say about 
the gender gap than the social issues do.

<p>

Interestingly, the polling shows that there is one 
group in America that is overwhelmingly supportive of 
abortion on demand, and that group is men between the ages 
of 18 and 25, and I would suggest that that is nothing a 
politician should be proud about.  The reason men between 
the ages of 18 and 25 support abortion on demand is it makes 
it easier for them to run away from their responsibilities 
when they get a woman pregnant.  When that woman comes to 
them and says that she needs help or wants that man to stand 
up to do the responsible thing, he can throw his hands up 
and say, "Wait a minute.  I have nothing to do with this 
from this point on.  You have a right to abort.  Utilize 
that right.  That's the end of it." 

<p>

So it has been a real boon for young men.  It has 
been terrible for women and children, and I think 
politicians ought to be clear about who has benefitted from 
abortion on demand and who hasn't. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It has been a very fiery debate for 
you, Gary, in the last two weeks.  In fact the front page of 
the <i>New York Times</i> shows Senator Dole attacking you for your 
pro-life stance.  You have had a long history in Washington. 
It seems strange to suddenly find that objectionable.  Why 
do you think that Senator Dole did attack you personally? 

<p>

MR. BAUER: Kristi, I have no idea. I have worked 
closely with Senator Dole.  It is a little unusual, I think, 
for him to attack me for defending a platform plank that he 
says he believes in.  That doesn't make any sense to me at 
all.  But I have worked with him in the past; I am sure I 
will work with him in the future.

<p>

We do have, though, a core set of issues that we 
stand for:  the sanctity of life, the importance of the 
family, traditional values, teaching children reliable 
standards of right and wrong.  And the only credibility I 
can ever have in Washington is if I am consistent in 
standing for those things, even if on any given day it might 
irritate one politician or another.  Now, usually it 
irritates liberal Democrats; in this case, it irritated a 
conservative Republican.  But I can't start fine-tuning the 
core set of values that we have to satisfy people that are 
running for office.  That would quickly end any influence 
whatsoever that I could ever have in Washington. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  For the most part, the media has 
ignored the abortion and right-to-life controversy in the 
Democratic Party. Sunday in the <i>Washington Post</i>, there was 
an article of Democratic Party leaders and office holders 
saying, "Look, we have a pro-life side as well, and we, the 
pro-life members of the Democratic Party, want to address 
our convention."

<p>

You have been advising pro-life candidates for a 
long time, Democratic and Republican and independent.  How 
would you advise someone on how to handle the sanctity-of-life 
issue?  How does someone need to play that to have 
success? 

<p>

MR. BAUER: Sure. The American people are deeply 
divided over the issue, so I never want to suggest that it 
is an easy issue to handle.  But I think if you believe in 
the sanctity of human life, as I do, that you can't run from 
it.  You can't try to be all things to all people. 

<p>

I guess I go back to the man that will probably be 
my favorite President for the rest of my life, and that is 
Ronald Reagan.  Ronald Reagan was unambiguous about this.  
He was gentle in describing his position.  He wasn't harsh. 
He didn't attack women, certainly, because women have been 
exploited by this as much as anyone has.  But he was clear 
about it.  He was clear that he firmly believed that unborn 
children deserved constitutional protection, and he won one 
of the biggest landslides in American history, even though 
everyone in the country knew that was his position. 

<p>

That's the model that I would recommend to Bob 
Dole or to somebody running for the Senate or the House or 
even for a local city council race.  State your position 
clearly, do it fairly, do it with a sense of compassion.  
But don't ever run away from the defense of innocent human 
life. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you, Gary, for being with us 
today on Behind the Headlines. 

<p>

MR. BAUER: Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, 
<i>Straight Talk</i> begins our discussion of fatherhood.  What 
does it take to be a good father?  Stay tuned to hear how 
our guests answer that crucial question. 

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[Segment from Promise Keepers, RFK Stadium, May 25, 1996, follows:]

<p>

DR. CANALES: Whenever you are weak as a father, 
whenever you don't have what it takes as a husband, whenever 
you feel insecure, whenever you feel inadequate, whenever 
you feel like you don't have any strength, whenever you feel 
like you're not being a good enough dad, I want you to know 
that you can trust in God and He will bring you through and 
make up the difference for you and bring you out of Egypt 
into a strong and mighty situation and give you the strength 
you need to be a good dad. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

Please say Amen.

<p>

MEN [Attendees]: Amen.

<p>

DR. CANALES:  Right now I want you to do something 
with me.  I want you to take out your wallet, and I'm not 
going to tell you to give your neighbor money, and I'm not 
going to take up an offering, which I know you think I am, 
but I'm not.  I just want you to look at your pictures.
Take out your wallet if you've got some pictures.  Look at 
your wife and at your kids, if you've got them right there, 
and show them to your neighbor, all right?  Would you love 
them unconditionally?  Men, would you love them 
unconditionally?

<p>

MEN: Yes.

<p>

DR. CANALES:  Do they have to perform for you to 
love them? 

<p>

MEN: No.

<p>

DR. CANALES:  No.  Everybody say no!

<p>

MEN: No.

<p>

DR. CANALES:  Say "I" --

<p>

MEN:  I -- 

<p>

DR. CANALES:  "Love" --

<p>

MEN:  Love --

<p>

DR. CANALES: "Them."

<p>

MEN:  Them. 

<p>

DR. CANALES:  "Unconditionally." 

<p>

MEN:  Unconditionally. 

<p>

DR. CANALES:  "Not for what they do" --

<p>

MEN:  Not for what they do --

<p>

DR. CANALES:  "Or don't do."

<p>

MEN:  Or don't do.

<p>

DR. CANALES: "But for who they are."

<p>

MEN:  But for who they are.

<p>

MAN [Attendee]:  A father needs to be a man of 
integrity, a man of his word, show love for his children, 
his family, his wife, real concern for the things of God. 

<p>

MAN: I think a father should be a man who follows 
after the Lord.  He ought to be somebody who understands the 
word of God and tries to live it.  He should be somebody who 
cares about his family, his wife and his children, and is 
willing to sacrifice anything to take care of them.  Most of 
all, he cares for his children to the point that he wants 
them to be raised up to be godly women and godly men. 

<p>

BOY:  I love you, Dad. 

<p>

MAN:  I love you too, buddy. 

<p>

MAN:  Special father qualities.  Love.  I mean, to 
really be able to understand love and listen to your 
children. 

<p>

MAN:  Important characteristics that a father 
should have, I believe, are very much the ones that my 
father had, and that's just a man of integrity, a man of 
honesty, a man who's really faithful to his family and also 
a loving father who really loves his kids. 

<p>

MAN:  I guess the first one would be humble and 
understanding and able to accept their children no matter 
what, just to love them for who they are.  That's really 
important. 

<p>

MAN:  I think a father needs to be real and one 
that can show affection and love. 

<p>

YOUNG MAN:  I love you and I'm sorry about all the 
problems we've had. 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

MAN:  Loving, warm, gentle, comforting, and more 
importantly, a listening ear for our children, and to be 
around them and caring. 

<p>

MAN: A father should be very loyal to his kids, 
love them unconditionally, be there for them no matter what, 
supporting them when things go well and when they don't go 
maybe as well as they would have liked and just know that, 
no matter what, we're always there for them. 

<p>

[End of Promise Keepers segment.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  As we just saw, fatherhood requires 
a lot from men, and tonight's guests are here to discuss why 
many fathers have neglected that crucial role in their 
children's lives. 

<p>

I would like to welcome Terry Allen, chief of 
staff for Representative Steve Largent and father of five; 
Armstrong Williams, whom many viewers already know as a
television and radio talk show host and syndicated columnist
whose touching <i>USA Today</i> article honored his own father.

<p>

Also joining us is Bill Mattox, whom many of you 
know, FRC's Vice President for Policy, who consistently has 
made fatherhood a headlining issue and directed a national 
fatherhood campaign called Being a Dad is Important 
Business.  I would like to welcome all of you, a couple of 
days after Father's Day.

<p>

Bill, you wrote an Op-Ed not too long ago talking 
about how, on Father's Day, you get the joke cards; on 
Mother's Day you get the honoring and revering of motherhood 
and all that it is.  Why do fathers seem to get such a bad 
rap? 

<p>

MR. MATTOX: Well, you know, it's funny. There 
really is a very different quality to the types of cards 
that people give at Father's day.  I mean, you do see 
sentimental cards on both occasions, but it's rare that you 
see Mother's Day cards that have any kind of joke, or if 
there is some sort of humor involved, it quite often will 
take shots at Dad, whereas it's quite routine for fathers to 
be the butt of jokes in the Father's Day cards. 

<p>

I think some of this is probably a reflection of 
the fact that men open themselves up to that kind of abuse 
by failing to sometimes come off swiftly in their duties in 
the home.  But I think a lot of it is just a reflection of 
the fact that we expect fathers to kind of roll with the 
punches and to be able to mix it up with us. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Broad shoulders.

<p>

MR. MATTOX: Yes, and want, as you say, to kind of 
keep mothers in a revered status.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Fathers don't seem to get that.

<p>

Armstrong, your column was very revering, very 
reverent, and I am going to encourage people to call and get 
a copy of it.  But as you look at your own father and at 
fatherhood in general, why do you think that fathers don't 
often get the tribute you wrote for your own dad? 

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS:  Well, statistics would bear out 
that 70 percent of adolescent murderers are born into 
fatherless homes.  Sixty percent of American rapists come 
from fatherless homes.  I mean kids who don't do well in 
school and who have low self-esteem don't have a father in 
the home. 

<p>

And for me it was not a decision that I made; it 
was a decision that my parents made.  They took their 
marriage vows very seriously, for sickness or in health, for 
better or for worse, and till death do them part. 

<p>

The problem is not for me as a man.  I grew up 
with a father, so obviously, growing up with a father, all 
my adolescent life, obviously, I want to emulate that.  You 
only repeat the tape that's in the home. 

<p>

And with so many households today without fathers, 
many kids feel it's the norm, and you have it reinforced by 
television, by the movies, that, well, this is the norm.  
And a lot of mothers will say today, "I did a fine job.  I 
never missed a man."  But that is not true.  It takes two 
parents to raise a child. 

<p>

But this started 30 or 40 years ago, and unless we 
get back to teaching through the church and through other 
organizations that the best home is with a mother and a 
father, and to restore the man in his proper place, then it 
will never change; it will only get worse. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, Terry, I thought it was an 
interesting contrast recently when Susan Molinari comes back 
to Congress with her child and is very welcomed.  I thought 
of all the men laboring as fathers rather unremarkedly.  You 
know, women are having children and they're coming in and 
working, and it's hardly discussed at all.  You know, you're 
in a place where there's a lot of work hours.  How is 
fatherhood viewed up on the Hill and in official Washington? 

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  Well, I think it is better than it 
used to be.  I think there is at least an attempt to have a 
family-friendly, or at least there's --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  More of an attempt.

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  -- more of an attempt, at least an 
acknowledgement that we need to have a family-friendly 
Congress.  Whether or not we are actually there -- certainly 
in 1995 that was not the case; in 1996, the schedule is a 
little better and the hours are not as late. 

<p>

But I think, generally, it is not that different 
from where you have the attitude in corporate America or in 
society in general that, as Bill said, generally does not 
take the role of nurturer or provider as seriously; at least 
fathers are not thought of in that role as much as women 
are, and so it is a reflection of the attitude that 
individual fathers have that they are more expendable or 
they are more -- you know, if they work late, it's not that 
important, but if Mom works late, boy, the kids really feel 
it, because she is the primary care-giver.  And it's a 
reflection of the attitudes of our society and culture. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The <i>Wall Street Journal</i> Work and 
Family column has made a big deal in the last couple weeks, 
and the last two months in particular, about men getting on 
the daddy track; you know, CEOs resigning.

<p>

But do you think that's a real trend?  Are men 
maybe just publicly reevaluating a little more, or are they 
really getting on a daddy track? 

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS: You know, it is true that you have 
a lot of households with both parents.  But you have 
absentee fathers.  I remember a story someone was telling me 
that there was this father who is a CEO, who is very busy, 
and he had planned to spend his kid's birthday with him for 
months in advance, and it was a 16th birthday. 

<p>

But then, all of a sudden, he got this speaking 
engagement that was going to pay him $1,000, but more 
importantly than the money, it would have afforded him an 
opportunity to sort of rub shoulders with the people that 
could really advance his career. 

<p>

And so, three weeks before the engagement, he met 
with his son and said, "Look, this engagement has come up.
I didn't realize it, but it's something that is very 
beneficial for me and it's going to help my career, so I'll 
cut a deal with you.  I'll give you the $1,000 and I'll go 
make the speech."

<p>

And the son said, "No, Dad, you keep the money.
It's more important that I spend the day with you." 

<p>

And that's a lot of what's going on, and I don't 
think it's that CEOs need to go back home and play nurturer; 
it's that they need to understand that they need to spend 
quality time with their children. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  They need to just come home in general.

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS:  Right. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Rather than quit their job. 

<p>

What do you think, Bill?  Is there a daddy track? 

<p>

MR. MATTOX: I think that there is a reevaluation 
taking place among really both women and men, but I think 
particularly among men, because if you look -- especially I 
was noticing the clip on Promise Keepers -- if you go and 
talk to many of the individuals there, you'll find that 
among that kind of baby boomer cohort, there are a number of 
men who perceive that somehow they missed out and that they 
would like to devote more of their time and energy and 
attention to rearing children than perhaps their fathers 
did.

<p>

I am not altogether certain that some of the 
criticism that is often levied against the fathers of old is 
justified.  But I do think it's a healthy thing that many 
men today are taking these responsibilities more seriously 
and do appear to be willing to at least consider sacrifices 
that might not have been considered proper a generation or 
more ago. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have about a minute left, and I 
wanted you all to respond quickly. <i>Newsweek</i>, I think, had a 
front-page and cover story on fathering, and they said that 
today's men universally think that they are better equipped 
to be fathers and are better dads.  Do you think we're 
raising a better generation of fathers, or has the self-esteem 
curriculum leaked into our national fatherhood debate?

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS:  That's not politically correct. 

<p>

I don't think <i>Newsweek</i> could be further from the 
truth.  I think the dads of yesteryear were better; they 
were more disciplinarian, and plus they did not have to 
compete with the media culture of today.  I mean, parents 
have a lot to compete with, with music, with entertainment, 
and with the kids' culture, the environment that they are 
in.  So, no, I would not agree with <i>Newsweek</i> on that 
predictor.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to have to come back 
and hear the comments of the other two of you. 

<p>

<i>Straight Talk</i> brings you more after this 
commercial break.  Don't go away. 

<p>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Tonight we are celebrating 
fatherhood, and I am joined by Terry Allen, chief of staff 
for Representative Steve Largent; Armstrong Williams, who 
spans all media as a television and radio talk show host and 
syndicated columnist; and Bill Mattox, the Family Research 
Council's Vice President for Policy.  Welcome back. 

<p>

We were kind of talking about <i>Newsweek</i>'s 
assessment that today's dad is empowered to be the best dad 
that he can be.  Terry, what do you think?  I mean, have we 
invented a better father than the men of the 1940s and 1950s 
or even their ancestors?

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  I don't think so.  I hope so, but 
today's fathers are competing with a media that is openly 
hostile at times to the values that so many fathers want to 
instill in their children.  I know I run up against that.  
You know, we have a 6:30 hour where it is kind of after 
homework but before dinner and this kind of limbo time where 
the television shows that used to come on were <i>Happy Days</i>
and <i>Laverne and Shirley</i>, and now they are shows that I 
really have to watch for my children to pick up on things 
that I don't want them to hear. So it's tough. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes.  Right around that hour you get 
<i>The Simpsons</i> with the inevitable buffoon father.

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  Yes, exactly, and <i>Married with
Children</i> and some of those.

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS:  [Unintelligible] the ones that you 
don't pick up on. 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, right.

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  So fathers are competing against a lot 
today that they didn't have to compete with 30 years ago. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes. At least father knew something, even if he 
didn't always know best.

<p>

Bill, what do you think?  I mean, have we got the 
perfect genetic dad now? 

<p>

MR. MATTOX: No. I think it is very difficult to 
argue that at a time when four out of ten kids are going to 
bed every night living in a home without a father present 
that we have somehow reached an age or an era in which we 
have responsible fatherhood to the max.  We are certainly 
far short of that. 

<p>

I do think, however, that there is a subpopulation 
of fathers that, in light of all the problems around and in 
light of some of the challenges that are facing them, are 
perhaps stepping up to the plate in a new and different and 
perhaps better way than men of a previous generation, not 
that men of a previous generation wouldn't have done so, but 
that the circumstances were different, the surrounding 
culture was much more favorable.  The need for strong 
fathers and strong mothers may not have been as great. 

<p>

And so I do think that there is at least a 
subpopulation that is taking this stuff very seriously, and 
that gives us a glimmer of hope when we look at the 
magnitude of some of the problems that are caused by 
fatherlessness. 

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS: You know, and the other thing is, 
too, long ago you never had the kind of dysfunctional 
families that you have today, and that fathers would abandon 
their children was unheard of; nor did you have women who 
would be so boisterous about being pregnant and carrying 
somebody's child that they were not married to. 

<p>

And I would not even fool myself -- I don't know 
about Terry and everybody else here -- I would never 
convince myself that I could be a better parent, a better 
father than my father.  I would not even try to fool myself 
to say that I can achieve what my father achieved, because 
to me it is almost virtually impossible.  The course, the 
game has changed. 

<p>

You have to be more tolerant.  I mean, you have 
laws that say you cannot discipline your children.  Your 
child can file an abuse suit against you.  I mean, there are 
all kinds of things more important, which is the law.  The 
law makes it difficult for you to be a parent today, and you 
have to contend with that.

<p>

MR. MATTOX:  Absolutely. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think even what is a good father 
has lost its definition.  My own father, father of six -- I 
have to say, "Hey, Dad" -- when he would say, "How do I know 
that I love you?" in addition to all that he said, he would 
tell us, "Watch what I do.  You have food on the table, you 
have clothes on your back.  I am faithful to your mother.  
That's how you know that I love you."  And I heard him say 
that a million times, defining his love by his action. 

<p>

But today fathering can be defined as money, it 
can be defined as quality time, which I am not exactly sure 
what that is -- maybe you all do -- but how do you define 
what is a good father?  You know, our culture seems to 
picture a guy with a big credit card. 

<p>

MR. MATTOX:  There's a great deal of confusion on 
this question in our culture.  I think that we are 
comfortable seeing Dad take on all kinds of new roles, if 
you would look at least at some of the women's magazines and 
that kind of thing.  But I think that there is a failure to 
appreciate some of the unique and irreplaceable 
contributions that men make to family life and the fact that 
mothers and fathers are not intended to be interchangeable. 

<p>

I think one of the things that is beginning to 
stir in some of the discussion taking place at least among 
people in this town and in other places around the country 
is a kind of renewed appreciation and recognition that 
fathers do bring something different to the table and that 
we want them to. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What do they bring? 

<p>

MR. MATTOX:  Well, I think one of the things that 
they bring is the ability to help young children, especially 
boys, learn to develop self-control, especially over their 
kind of physical bodies and what not.  I mean, the scene of 
a dad, say, wrestling on the floor with children has, I 
think, in many ways been kind of seen as a nice little 
playful thing that doesn't really have a great deal of 
importance. 

<p>

But, instead, if you listen to some of the 
developmental psychologists, they'll tell you that, no, that 
sort of interplay, which we would never expect, really, of a 
mom, to be down on the floor wrestling, is quite important 
from the standpoint of helping boys to understand that they 
can use some of their aggressive tendencies in constructive 
ways but that there are limits and that when they cross 
lines and they kick or they bite or they punch in ways that 
are inappropriate, that there will be ramifications, there 
will be consequences. 

<p>

And if those lessons are taught in that kind of 
setting, then we don't often see boys of 14, 15, 16 out 
raping and pillaging. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's true. 

<p>

MR. MATTOX:  When boys, however, are deprived of 
that kind of instruction, it's not at all surprising, then, 
that their aggressive masculine tendencies would spill over 
into all kinds of destructive social behavior. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What do you think, Terry?  That is 
fascinating.  What's the mark of a good father?  You know, 
wrestling, playing with the children and bringing something 
different to the table. 

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  I would have to say someone primarily 
who takes his responsibilities seriously.  You know, the 
technique, being a father is a relationship, and it takes 
time and it takes practice, and it is in the context of that 
relationship that you are a father. 

<p>

But, first and foremost, the commitment to be a 
father and to stay a father is primarily, I think, the most 
important thing, and that commitment over time will manifest 
itself in a myriad of different ways and forms and things 
that you as a father may not even pick up on.  But the fact 
that you're there, you're consistently there, and you're 
learning to work out your own faults and helping your 
children learn to grow and be mature and act responsibly, 
that in and of itself is profound, I think. 

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS:  You know, I think -- and I can only 
go back to my own childhood and my involvement with a lot of 
young men -- I think the most important thing that a father 
can do is teach his child that he is imperfect, that he does 
not have all the answers, and that the foundation of 
everything is in the Ten Commandments of the Bible. 

<p>

"And yet, when I'm not with you," as my father 
used to say to me, "when I'm not with you and you fall short 
and you're in a situation and you don't know what to do, you 
go to those laws and those commandments," which were etched 
in my heart.

<p>

When you teach your child that -- it is critical 
that a father teaches his child an example of discipline, 
work ethic, love for humanity, and routine.  A child, 
especially a young man, must have routine in their life.  
Especially a young man should not have idle time.  You must 
teach that child to work. 

<p>

And another thing that a father should do -- and I 
am sure these gentlemen may agree with me -- is that my 
father always taught us that no young man should ever be in 
bed past 8 a.m. in the morning.  A young man should be up. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: He rises and works.

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS:  If he has nothing to do, he should 
find something to do.  Those are very important lessons that 
can lead to big things. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: My father was on your team, believe me.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we'll hear more about 
the joys and trials of fatherhood.  Join us after the break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[National Fatherhood Initiative PSA.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Like the National Fatherhood 
Initiative, which gave us the fatherhood public service 
announcement which we just saw, the men joining me today are 
actively working to restore respect to fatherhood.  Welcome 
back to Terry Allen, Armstrong Williams, and Bill Mattox. 

<p>

There is a tremendous love in Washington of 
government fixes for societal problems, and there are some 
things that government can do, perhaps more limited than it 
thinks.  But what can government do to help men in their 
desire to be good fathers or just to increase the profile of 
fatherhood? 

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  Well, there's two things we can do 
first off, right away.  First is end the penalty for intact 
families that we have in our public assistance programs.  We 
talked about the tragedy of fatherless children and broken 
homes.  We are actually, in federal policy, encouraging 
that, promoting that, and penalizing intact families through 
the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program, which 
is more commonly known as welfare, and other public 
assistance programs.

<p>

And that is a tragedy.  And that has driven the 
demographic on the number of children that are in broken 
homes.  It's a tragedy.  It has to be stopped.  It was fixed 
in the welfare reform bill.  It was vetoed twice.  Enough 
said. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Not surprisingly.

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  The second thing that we can do is we 
can address the family time famine, which the Family 
Research Council has talked a lot about, that basically in 
1950 the average family spent 2 percent of its income in 
federal taxes; today they spend 24 percent of its income in 
federal taxes.  That has driven the need for a second 
income, which creates all types of challenges for parents 
who struggle to raise children and spend time with their 
children.  So we have a famine of time that we are trying to 
find to spend with our kids. 

<p>

Those are two federal policies that we can fix 
right now to address that issue that are driving the 
demographics on fatherless families. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I was interested to see that the 
average second earner in a family, which is normally the 
woman, is bringing in around 30 percent of the family's 
overall budget, which is the tax burden of the average 
American family.  Astounding if you think about it. 

<p>

Anything else that government can do?  Or maybe 
the best thing it could do is stay out. 

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS:  Well, the government should 
encourage marriage instead of rewarding promiscuity, which 
it does, and the government should also realize that the 
best department of health, education, and welfare is a two-
parent family, and the best that the government can do is 
encourage that through its policies by giving more power to 
parents over their children and over their families; by 
giving more tax breaks to families, and is something that it 
doesn't do. 

<p>

And in the name of compassion, even with a lot of 
government programs, with these programs, especially welfare 
and the Great Society programs, it has done more to 
discourage fathers from being in the home than anything 
else.  What kind of policy would say to you that unless the 
father is able to pay child support, then and only then can 
they have any kind of interaction with that child?  Whether 
that parent can afford to pay child support or not should be 
of least importance if that father wants to spend time with 
that child.  That child needs that father interacting with 
him on a daily basis so he can see that man, because women 
cannot teach boys how to be men.  Only a man can do that. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And, you know, you are never going 
to hear that in the cultural debate today.  I mean, men have 
been reduced to money.  If money comes in from the 
government, therefore, there is no need for men. 

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS:  We have talked to families and we 
have talked to kids, and we have talked to kids who have had 
fathers pay the money but yet they were absent, and the kids 
will tell you later on in life, "That's meaningless to me.
I didn't need the money.  I needed a father."

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes.  Can the government do 
anything, Bill, or can the government get out of the way? 

<p>

MR. MATTOX:  Well, I think that Armstrong is 
right, that there is a need for government policymakers to 
look for ways to strengthen and encourage marriage, and I am 
encouraged by the fact that a number of states are currently 
looking at divorce laws and seeking to make reforms that 
would make it difficult, if not impossible, for one spouse 
to unilaterally walk away from a marriage and leave the 
other spouse high and dry without any kind of legal 
recourse. 

<p>

I understand that there are a lot of families that 
have difficult times and are going through struggles and all 
of that, but I think it's important that we take seriously 
those marriage vows and that the state stand behind the 
promises that have been made from one spouse to the other 
and encourage as much as possible some type of 
reconciliation when problems do arise. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What do you find most encouraging in 
the national discussion of fatherhood that is taking place 
right now?  Because there are a lot more articles out there 
now.  Is there any encouraging data for people who are 
saying, you know, we've got fatherlessness as one of the 
greatest pathologies of all time facing our culture?  
Anything encouraging out there that you see? 

<p>


MR. WILLIAMS:  You know, I don't know if you 
realize this, but 80 percent of the time, when a father is 
given visitation rights with his children, he pays his money 
and he is active in the child's life.  Ninety percent of the 
time when he is given visitation rights and they both have 
legal rights to the child, they are active, and many times 
they end up maybe getting back with the mother.  But it has 
made a difference in the child's life and a difference in 
the growth.  So we need to encourage that. 

<p>

The sad thing about it -- and I don't want to 
blame this on liberalism -- we need to admit in this society 
that even though we tried policies, the whole thing to 
uplift mankind, a lot of these policies have done more harm 
than good, and we need to go back and look at these laws, 
and if these laws have not worked, if they have discouraged 
families, we need to change these laws.  We need to have the 
courage to say that we were wrong and to abandon some of 
these ideas and laws of the past.  And no one is willing to 
have the courage to step forward, because when you do, they 
will say you lack compassion.  And so people don't have the 
courage anymore to step up -- we need real men and women in 
society to stand up and say, "Hey, this does not work.  It 
doesn't matter what you call me.  Vilify me now, but the 
children will be the true winners in the future." 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We saw here in Washington, D.C., the 
Million Man March.  We saw here recently Promise Keepers, a 
national men's movement.  Do you think that the growth of 
these men's movements is going to help get men involved?  
Terry? 

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  Yes, I do.  I hope, and I have seen, 
and I am sure you have seen and we have all seen some of 
that on a local level around the country, Promise Keepers 
gatherings all across the country.  It is one of those 
movements that has kind of just caught on.  It is beyond the 
expectations of the founders of the organization now, and 
they are scratching where people are itching, and that is 
encouraging to know that men are starting to take their 
responsibility seriously and there is a willingness to 
discuss, Hey, what are my responsibilities as a father?  And 
even those fathers that are committed, they are willing to 
ask, Well, are there greater commitments that maybe I 
haven't really even considered?  And that is helpful. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to go around.  I am 
sorry, we are kind of coming near the end, unless, Bill, you 
want to add one other comment.  What I would like is if you 
all -- we have a couple, just about a minute and a half left 
-- would give the best piece of advice or a great piece of 
advice that your father gave you.  You know, this is our 
Father's Day tribute, so this is an opportunity for you all 
to give a tribute to your father. 

<p>

I could say that the best thing that my dad ever 
said to me is that work is good.  You know, it's not a bad 
thing; it's not a punishment.  Work is good, and so work. 

<p>

Bill, what would you say? 

<p>

MR. MATTOX:  I think the thing, the virtue that I 
think stands out most in what I think of my father is 
honesty.  He was incredibly -- I mean, he was an admissions 
officer at a major university and actually told one of my 
sisters, "Don't even bother to apply because I'm not going 
to cut you any special slack, and you don't make the grade." 

<p>

Well, you know, leaving aside whatever you may 
think of that, at the end of the day, he was someone who 
really did things by the book, who really believed in having 
integrity and being honest, and that is something that I 
think we don't see enough of these days. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to go quickly. 

<p>

Armstrong, your dad's best advice? 

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS:  The best advice from my father was 
that God created us all equal, even though sometimes we may 
be treated (un)equally.  No matter what the hue of our skin 
may be, or our gender, we are all the same, and you judge 
people by their hearts, not by what they look like. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Great advice.  Terry, you're quick and last.

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  Well, more than the advice would be 
the example he gave of just being someone who is faithful, 
who has integrity and is consistent across the board with 
everything he did and said. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you so much, all of you. 

<p>

When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shares more about 
the plight of America's families.  Please don't go away. 

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>.

<p>

Unfortunately, America's children suffer the loss 
of fathers primarily through divorce, a topic that was 
discussed in a Family Research Council press conference 
highlighting the Annual Family Issues Survey.  Let's hear 
more as we bring you some Homefront News. 

<p>
<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>
<p>

[Segment from FRC Family Issues Survey Press 
Conference November 21, 1995, follows:] 

<p>

COL. MAGINNIS:  Divorce.  Well, divorce is 
approaching about 50 percent of all marriages in this 
country, and it is devastating families from coast to coast. 
And we have found that divorce laws in virtually every state 
in this country give more legal right to the person seeking 
the divorce than for the spouse that wants to try to keep 
the family together. 

<p>

Now, when we asked all Americans, we found that 55 
percent of them favor legislation that would reverse this 
situation. 

<p>

Also, in divorce cases that are based on adultery 
or on abuse, we found that three out of four Americans say 
we want to favor the abused spouse by giving the abused 
spouse custody over children.  They want legislation to do 
that. 

<p>

And a majority indicate that they favor giving the 
non-philandering spouse more than half of the couple's 
property and, not surprisingly, as Bill pointed out earlier, 
we found that the divorce reform is particularly strong 
amongst those that are weekly church goers. 

<p>

MR. MATTOX:  I do want to add one little footnote 
to that point that the colonel made about the divorce 
reform, and that is, not only are the religiously devout 
more likely than the average Americans to support such 
measures, divorce reform measures, but, interestingly, those 
in that 20-something generation, the generation X crowd, 
have a higher than average level of support for divorce 
reform measures.  This, I think, is quite likely a 
reflection of the fact that many of them have, themselves, 
experienced some of the negative fallout of their parents' 
divorce and are looking for ways in which to undergird 
marital stability.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I am your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i> we are bringing you an issue which
touches the life of every mother and father.  Parental
rights have slowly diminished in our schools and our
culture, sometimes through the growth of the social worker 
state, sometimes through the courts.  Little by little, 
these rights have been placed in the hands of teachers, 
social workers, judges, and bureaucrats.  The politically 
correct mentality seems to find parents guilty until proven 
innocent.

<p>

We will show you exclusive clips from Congressman 
Steve Largent's staff briefing regarding the Parental Rights 
and Responsibilities Act.  You will hear the shocking story 
of a father of an 11-year-old girl who underwent a genital 
exam at her school without the consent or prior notification 
of her parents.

<p>

To help us understand why parents are fighting for 
their inherent rights to lovingly guide their own children, 
I had the opportunity to talk to representatives from 
several state policy councils who are increasingly hearing 
parents' cries for help. Let's take a look.

<p>

I am joined first -- let me go around, ladies 
first -- by Linda Dealy, who is on the board of directors of 
Capital Resource Institute in California; and then Joe 
Clark, who is executive director of the Illinois Family 
Institute.  We go to Steve Knudsen, who is director of state 
and local affairs for the Family Research Council and 
recently joined Family Research Council after heading a 
Texas FPC.

<p>

To my right, we have John Paulton of the South 
Dakota Family Policy Council; then Bill Brooks of the North 
Carolina Family Policy Council; and finally, last but not 
least, Paul Sienna of the Family Policy Center in Missouri.
A wonderful state, I vacation there often.

<p>

But Steve, let's go to you first.  You were at the 
local level, taking a look at parents' issues.  Now you are 
in Washington, D.C.  There are a lot of things that you 
could choose to have on your plate, but we are looking at 
parental rights and responsibilities.  Why?

<p>

MR. KNUDSEN:  Well, it is interesting, Kristi.
Our first lady has talked a lot about it takes a village, 
and I happen to think that is taking an African proverb 
somewhat out of context.  I think what that proverb is 
trying to say was that a village should support a parent as 
it raises its child.  What she is suggesting is that the 
village should raise the child.  So we have a situation here 
where governmental entities across our country are trying to 
take more and more of the child-raising responsibilities 
away from parents.  So we really need to find a way to alter 
that and actually stem the tide.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  This week, on Sunday as a matter of 
fact, the Democratic leadership introduced its family plan, 
and what is always interesting -- I mean, we are not having 
a partisan discussion here -- but so many Democratic family 
plans involve them saying this is what I am going to do for 
your family or maybe to your family, while a lot of 
Republican approaches have been this is how we are going to 
empower parents.

<p>

The Family Rights and Responsibilities Act for 
some people is difficult to understand, but how would you 
all describe it, and in particular, how do you describe it 
to the people you are talking to?

<p>

MS. DEALY:  When we talk about this particular 
issue in California, the thing that I really try to bring 
home every time is that it is called the Family Rights and 
Responsibility Act because rights and responsibilities go 
hand in hand.  When you have a responsibility for something, 
you should also have the right to fulfill that 
responsibility.  When you have a right to something, every 
right carries with it a certain amount of responsibility, 
and that is exactly where parents need to be and should be 
and should be free to be is the ones that are directly 
responsible for the oversight and raising of their children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Where in your states have you seen 
the line crossed?  You know, if we are saying in the 
Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act that parents are 
being encroached, you know, their territory is being seized, 
where are we seeing it seized?

<p>

MR. BROOKS:  Kristi, we have seen it in North 
Carolina in recent years just through giving social services 
more authority.  One of the things, of course, that goes 
along with the parental responsibility is the necessity to 
exercise that responsibility, and where we see that not 
exercised in society, there is always the tendency to step 
in and say, well, what can be done, and if you are the 
government, if you have a mindset that this is the 
government's problem, then the cure is going to be 
governmental, and we do not always think, particularly when 
it comes to basic rights of parents and children, that that 
is the appropriate response.

<p>

We have seen situations where social services has 
the ability to drive by a neighborhood and basically make a 
decision on a child being in an inappropriate situation and 
then taking action to do something about that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So you are saying they would, like, 
drive through a neighborhood and say this home looks 
inappropriate; perhaps we should check further?

<p>

MR. BROOKS:  Well, or you may have a situation 
where a neighbor calls up and says, well, I saw Mr. Wood 
spank his child in the front yard, and all of a sudden 
social services shows up, takes the child into protective 
custody until they investigate the situation.  So the parent 
automatically is put on the defensive, instead of the 
presumption being that the parent was exercising what was in 
the best right of the child.

<p>

MR. CLARK:  Kristi, before we go any further, I 
would like to draw a distinction between the Parental Rights 
Amendment movement, which is underway in about 28 or 29 
states right now, as well as the federal legislation, which 
is different, and that is underway here, sponsored by Steve 
Largent.

<p>

As you look at the state initiative, so far it has 
not passed in any state.  It is very difficult to pass 
amendments through general assemblies at the state level, 
and probably Colorado is further along than anyone at this 
point.  They have an initiative underway there by the voters 
of that state.  In Illinois this year, we got it through the 
executive committee of the senate, and the night before 
there was to be a vote by our full senate, in talking with 
the senate leadership decided not to call it for a vote, 
because it was very iffy, very problematic, as to whether or 
not we had that vote.

<p>

But the major distinction here that I want to make 
is that each state has slightly different language.  For 
example, ours read that the fundamental right of parents to 
direct the upbringing and education of their children shall 
not be infringed. Colorado's is different.  What is going 
on in other states is a little bit different, as well, and I 
assume we will come back and talk about the language to the 
federal legislation.

<p>

But as you look at the examples that have brought 
about the need for this, ours tend to be much more in 
education, and we have time after time seen situations 
similar to what Bill mentioned, except where educators have 
intervened in families, and probably one of the more 
flagrant ones that I recall was actually given as testimony 
at one of the hearings that was held by our legislators in 
Springfield was the Milar[?] family down in Champaign.  This 
was a family that was abiding by state law which says you 
can opt out of objectionable sex education programs.  The 
regional superintendent and the principal for that area, for 
that school, had decided to test this apparently, and so 
they refused to let them opt out.

<p>

We had to get the Rutherford Institute and some 
pro bono attorney work done, and we finally got it to the 
attorneys at the State Board of Education, and all of a 
sudden they said, okay, we will let you opt out.  So about 
four families immediately opted out of that program.

<p>

So there is a very aggressive thought process, 
very intentional process going on in the Illinois education 
system to push this, test this parental rights situation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I think sometimes parental rights is 
easier to understand historically.  In Pennsylvania, where I 
am originally from, Amish people worked very hard to have a 
separate school system.  I think we are all aware that 
Christian Scientists often have worked very hard to make 
different medical choices.  But for the rest of us, the 
lines are not always clear.

<p>

Steve, we are going to come back and talk more 
about the state initiatives, but do you see this as going 
away any time soon?  I mean, are we going to resolve it in 
the near future?

<p>

MR. KNUDSEN:  I think this is going to be a battle 
for some time to come as some people try to redefine the 
rights and responsibilities of parents for them and as 
parents fight to maintain the traditional understanding of 
their rights and responsibilities, and like many issues that 
we deal with, there are people who ideologically will push 
this and push this and push this, and as parents who believe 
in our traditional role, it is going to be an ongoing battle 
until the hearts and minds of our country come around to 
understand the time-tested and age-proven responsibilities 
of parents.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  When we come back, we are going to 
talk more about what our parents' rights and 
responsibilities are.  Please stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[Videotape of Representative Steve Largent follows.]

<p>

MR. LARGENT:  But I will tell you that I believe 
that the long-term effect of what is taking place in our 
country -- I would describe it as opposed to being a tragic 
incident that causes Congress to act in a knee-jerk fashion, 
that in fact this is more of a slow erosion of parents'
authority and their ability to direct the upbringing of 
their children that has taken place over the last 10, 20 
years, and it has become increasingly more common across the 
country, where we are now seeing cases from literally every 
state in the country where a parent's ability to raise their 
children continues to be undermined time and time again.  So 
that is why I think that we have had more difficulty in 
getting Congress to move on the Parental Rights and 
Responsibility Act, although I will tell you that we have a 
good deal of momentum, and it is due largely to the 
tremendous support that we have gotten from the grassroots, 
from parents, from moms and dads all across the country that 
have been affected and are very concerned, in fact, worried, 
in fact I would even go so far as to say scared as to losing 
their ability to raise their own children and make decisions 
in directing their children's upbringing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>. I am joined by leaders at the 
state level who have been working on the Parental Rights and 
Responsibility Act and some state-based parents' rights 
issues.

<p>

Paul, before the break, we were talking about what 
are our rights and responsibilities, and you had some 
legislation in your state where that is being defined for 
us.  What is happening on that?

<p>

MR. SIENNA:  Well, actually it is the Missouri 
state Goals 2000 plan, and I think the primary issue here is 
whose children are these?  The plan itself explicitly states 
that the community takes ownership of and responsibility for 
our children, and it further goes on to state that the 
teachers know best about the health and well-being of the 
children.  In fact, this academic plan contains more 
information about the health and human services of the child 
than what it does about the academic performance and 
assessment.  So this is one of the fundamental things we 
have to ask ourselves and our government:  whose children 
are they?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And the government seems to have an 
answer.  You know, Steve, you wrote recently on an incident 
in East Stroudsberg, Pennsylvania, actually a town I have 
been to many times, and it is hard to believe in a small 
community like that of several thousand this could happen, 
but what happened there in terms of the state determining 
what is best for children's health?

<p>

MR. KNUDSEN: Well, several years ago in a couple 
of different instances, the state mandated that there would 
be a medical test of children within the school systems at 
the first grade, sixth grade, and eleventh grade, and in 
this particular incident, several sixth grade girls were 
taken for their medical exam to be performed by a doctor 
that the school district brought in, and what happened was 
that the doctor decided that she needed to do not only just 
the overall exam but also genital exams on the girls.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And they were how old?

<p>

MR. KNUDSEN:  This was sixth grade.  So they were 
12-year-old girls.  When the girls said no, they did not 
want to go through with that, they were still forced to.  
One tried to get out through a window.  One tried to call 
her parents.  They would not let her call her parents.  This 
was something that had not been told to the parents ahead of 
time.  I mean, the parents knew of the medical exam, but it 
was, again, one of those opt-out scenarios.

<p>

So if the note gets lost or if somehow the parent 
does not come back with the opt-out, the kids are 
automatically included.  There was no mention of a genital 
exam being performed.  In fact, the school district admitted 
afterwards that they did not know one was going to be 
performed, but they have come out now and said that they 
were within their right to perform it and so on and so 
forth.

<p>

But the bottom line is that you have 12-year-old 
girls who are being subjected to something that the parents 
had no clue was going to happen of an incredibly intimate 
nature.  Several of the girls have talked about nightmares 
since then, and different things that are going on, because 
they felt violated.  The fact that the school district has 
come out in support of the doctor, has not admitted a 
mistake, because their lawyers think they are going to be 
taken to court, you know, all those things.

<p>

MS. DEALY:  And here is the whole thing.  Who best 
cares for the well-being of these children?  Who has those 
children's best interest at heart?  You take 12-year-old 
girls who have been traumatized, literally, for the rest of 
the lives, that the schoolteachers and the doctor are going 
to go off on their merry way after these children are gone, 
but the parents are going to have to deal with and help in 
not only the healing process but the adjustment process for 
these girls for the rest of their lives on this, and this is 
something that not only did not the school not have any 
right by any rational reasoning concept to have been 
involved in this way with the children, but then for the 
legal community to side against the parents, the parents are 
left standing all by themselves.  It really does beg to the 
heart of the question of who cares the most for those 
children? Who has those children's long-term best interests 
at heart?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  John, what are you seeing?

<p>

MR. PAULTON:  Well, that is a major example, the 
East Strasbourg situation, but I think daily there are 
examples of the more common variety.  Just at the end of 
this last school year, I had a parent call me and say that 
she was upset because her daughter, her fourth grade 
daughter, was going to be going to a science fair in the 
middle part of the state, several hundred miles, staying 
overnight in a hotel, unsupervised, and she did not feel 
comfortable with that.  Understandably, she wanted to go 
along.  She wanted to take her daughter.

<p>

The school district said no.  If the daughter is 
going to go, she has to go on the bus with the other 
students; you cannot go.  There were a number of parents 
that were very upset about that, and they had to go through 
a process of several meetings, letters.  Eventually they did 
get that right back, but again, you just have to ask the 
question:  whose kids are these?

<p>

MR. CLARK:  Let me hasten to add that it varies 
very much by school district and by even school building, 
and to say that all schools are doing this is erroneous.  In 
fact, there are many teachers and some administrators that 
are very concerned about this thing that is taking place.  
So what it comes back to is each parent, each family, has to 
monitor what is going on at their school with their teachers 
and their children, because you cannot know for sure unless 
you have done the homework that you need to do as a parent.

<p>

MR. DEALY:  Which is a really good point, John, 
that yes, these are the extreme examples that we can cite 
here, but in light of that, the legal groundwork has been 
laid that this could happen anywhere, and they would be 
protected.  That is why we go back to why this legislation 
is necessary.  It is to reassert and establish once and for 
all that it is parents who have the ultimate rights and 
authority and responsibility for the rearing of their 
children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I think that might be the consensus 
around this table, but I am reminded of a case out of 
Washington State where parents -- a child, an 8-year-old boy 
who was shy was given counseling by the school without 
parental knowledge or consent.  When the boy started acting 
strangely and they took him to their own counselor and were 
told this boy has obviously been treated, what happened to 
him, they tried to get those medical records and lost a 
court case, to see the records for their own son, from the 
counseling that they did not choose and still have no first-hand 
knowledge of.

<p>

MR. SCIANNA:  I think the issue here, too, gets 
back to we are hearing so much the mantra of the day is it 
takes a village, and it is okay if the village has the same 
values, but unfortunately the village that many times is 
spoken of is contrary to the values that we hold dearly as 
parents.  We are seeing situations in Missouri where kids 
who are struggling with same-sex identity issues are sent to 
a counselor who happens to be a homosexual, and that is like 
sending a drunk to another drunk for counseling.  I mean, it 
just does not seem to work out that way.

<p>

One of the things that just still concerns me 
greatly, as I have three children, in order for them to take 
an aspirin at school, I have to send a permission slip.  But 
in some of the same schools, kids can go off-campus, receive 
abortion counseling and abortions without the parental 
consent.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And let's remember, this is a 
surgery.  You know, abortion is a surgery.  They will not 
give you an aspirin, but they will take your child 
anonymously for surgery without telling anyone.

<p>

MR. SCIANNA:  Right.  Life-threatening in many cases.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Exactly.

<p>

MS. DEALY:  And then at the same time, we will go 
back to it, you cannot get your ears pierced as a minor.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  That is right.

<p>

MS. DEALY:  Without parental written consent, but 
not only can you be -- some of these schools will arrange 
for abortions for these young girls, but then they will also 
arrange for -- in California -- for the state welfare agency 
to pick up the cost and arrange for those medical records to 
be sealed so that the parents, even if the parents found out 
and wanted to get the medical records again, they would be 
sealed from the parents to be able to have that information.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to have to talk more 
about what parents are facing and struggling with across 
America.  Please stay with us for more <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>.

<p>

[Videotape segment of Paul Tucker's staff briefing follows.]

<p>

MR. TUCKER:  We sent our child to school one day, 
with all the expectations that she is going to be going to 
school and there will be no problem, and she was informed 
that she had to go down for a physical examination.  She 
thought, no problem, because my daughter does go to camp 
every summer.  We do have physicals every summer for our 
children, and we do have the paperwork filled out, and we 
hand that in.

<p>

My daughter decided to leave class early to go 
down to the office to explain to these nurses that she had 
the paperwork filled out, that she really did not need a 
physical.  When she informed the nurses that she had done 
so, the nurse said "we have lost your paperwork; you have to 
have the physical."

<p>

My daughter said "but I already had one." They 
said, "well, it is too bad.  You have to have one anyway."
She said, "well, let me call my mother." They said no. "It 
does not matter what your parents think, you are going to 
have this physical anyway.  It would not matter what your 
mom said." Susie said, "I do not want a physical.  I don't
want that." They had heard some rumors that there was a 
genital part of this exam, and my daughter did not want to 
have this happen to her.

<p>

They said, "it's too bad, you have to have the 
exam," and my daughter, being a real nice girl -- I mean, 
just think of your daughter.  You teach them to respect 
teachers.  You teach them to respect elders, and there are 
certain things that have to be done in life that are not 
pleasant and stuff, but this really was not one of them that 
had to be done, especially at school, and Susie knew that 
she was not of age -- she is only 11 years old -- was not of 
age to have this type of genital exam.  The girls that were 
coming out prior to this were crying and real upset.

<p>

My daughter obeyed, under the pressures of the 
school, under the pressures of people she is supposed to 
respect, and went along with this exam.

<p>

The girls were asked in a room to strip down into 
their panties and their bras and stand there with no 
covering on whatsoever, and a lot of the girls were really 
upset at this point.  They were escorted into a room one at 
a time where the female nurse and a female pediatrician was 
to examine them.  This pediatrician, we have no idea, I have 
never met her, I have never heard of her, and I do not know 
who gave the right to do this type of examination on my 
daughter.  I certainly did not.

<p>

I turned my child over to the school.  The nurses 
were in charge of my daughter at this time.  The nurses 
should have taken responsibility and stopped at that.  My 
daughter went through a gynecological exam really against 
her will, against my will, my wife's will, without our 
knowledge whatsoever, and without our written consent.  We 
had no idea this was going to happen.

<p>

We sent our child to school one day to go to 
school.  My child comes home with this story that is 
unbelievable.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. I am joined by some real 
experts in parents' rights and state-based issues, some 
grassroots leaders from across America.

<p>

Before we went to the break, we were talking about 
the things that we have seen that often abuse parents'
rights, but you know, on the other side, people would say, 
look, what we are concerned about is that there are children 
being abused, that there are children who are being 
molested, and that parents, if they are not correctly 
monitored, may be actually injuring kids.  You know, who is 
against the Parents' Rights and Responsibilities Act?

<p>

MR. CLARK: As we worked on this Parental Rights 
Amendment to the Illinois State Constitution, one afternoon 
we counted ten lobbyists working the other side of the 
issue, and at least six of them, we believe, were in the 
employ of the National Education Association or the Illinois 
Education Association.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And their interests are a little 
different than children being molested.  They are a bit more 
personal.

<p>

MR. CLARK:  They were.  They were.  In fact, 
several school administrators have come to me privately, 
Christian men all, saying that, you know, we have a concern 
about this, because it will create havoc in our schools, 
which, in fact, it will not, and we come back to that.  But 
the other groups that are leading the opposition, the 
American Civil Liberties Union and a group in Illinois 
called Voices of Illinois Children, which was funded by some 
very liberal foundations, the concern that they voice is 
that this will be the parental abuse amendment, and they say 
that this is another way for protection of parents who 
discipline, spank, or abuse physically and mentally their 
children.  Now the fact of the matter is, abuse and neglect 
are defined through some 20-some-odd pages in the Illinois 
code already, and those laws are not impacted at all, and 
once you start taking people, legislators in particular, 
through that thought process, most of them are attorneys, 
and they understand very quickly that that is absurd.  That 
is not going to take place.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  That there already are laws to deal 
with the injury of children, but there is no law to deal 
with parents.

<p>

MR. CLARK:  That is right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Do we think that parents are really 
going to abuse their children under cover of this bill?

<p>

MR. PAULTON:  No, I do not believe so.  I think 
that, as Joe states, the laws are already written clearly.  
Where the laws are already written, we are safe.  This is 
not going to override protections in those areas that 
already exist.  What it will do is make sure that we are not 
only putting the responsibilities on parents, but we are 
giving them the proper control.

<p>

In South Dakota, we recently passed what we call 
the Grandparents' Bill for minors who have children, 
basically the parents who are the grandparents of the 
youngster that is coming along, they have the responsibility 
to provide.  It is a step in that direction.  But if we are 
putting that responsibility upon them, which I think is 
rightfully so, taking them out of the welfare system, giving 
the parents the responsibility, we ought to also be 
reaffirming their rights to raise and direct the upbringing 
of their children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Absolutely.

<p>

MS. DEALY:  The point that I was going to make is 
that the unfortunate reality in the world that we live today 
is there are some parents who have abdicated the proper 
responsibility of raising healthy children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So will this bill keep them from doing that?

<p>

MS. DEALY:  This bill will not keep them from 
doing that, but this bill will -- but that is a legal and 
criminal issue, and this bill in no way affects the criminal 
justice system from going after the appropriate measures 
towards those parents.  What it does is protect the rights 
of the vast majority of the rest of us parents who do have 
the primary goal of raising happy, healthy well-adjusted 
self-reliant children from being intruded upon by that same 
social services or criminal justice system in a wrongful way.

<p>

MR. SCIANNA:  As a matter fact, the other thing, 
too, in following up what Joe was saying, the opposition to 
a bill such as this, the recent Stand for Children rally 
here in Washington, D.C., if you look at the list of the 
organizations that participated in that rally, it was 
anything but a place for children.  Most of the groups that 
are opposed to this are opposed to the values that made 
America great.  Yes, we need to reaffirm the values of 
parents, and to follow up what Linda said, in other words, 
with responsibility comes accountability.  We at this table 
realize that there is a greater place of accountability than 
our government, but by the same token, we do not want to 
erase the necessary laws that are there that if you have 
abusive parents, to make sure that that is dealt with within 
our society.  That has always been dealt with.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It almost seems like it is more, in 
many ways, drawing a line in the sand between the social 
worker mentality in which parents are guilty until proven 
innocent, you know, that we are assuming parents are abusive 
and are molesting and are injuring, and if we do not get in 
there to help, we are going to have problems with that.

<p>

MR. BROOKS:  Kristi, we had a situation in North 
Carolina where there is a particular program that I will not 
name, but basically the social workers could come into the 
home under basically the -- what they were trying to do was 
to teach parents how to parent, but while they were there, 
they had a checklist, and they would look, and they would 
observe, and there was this long list of things that was 
totally judgmental and subjective, and based on these 
checklists, they then would have the authority to go back in 
and presumably intervene in these situations.  But we have 
seen that, and we see this cropping up in North Carolina in 
little small different ways.

<p>

We have a bill, for example, this past session 
which did not pass but would take away from parents the 
right to control who had access to their children, and it 
was entitled the Grandparents' Rights Act, but it basically 
would give presumption to grandparents to be able to sue 
parents to be able to get visitation rights to children, and 
the whole thing was based on a very few isolated cases 
around the states where unfortunately we had some parents 
that maybe should have given some more rights to the 
grandparents or had better access, but there was one couple 
who said, well, what we are after is the right to have those 
children for 3 weeks unattended in the summer and every 
other weekend by ourselves.  So this was sort of an unusual 
and strange situation that led to some legislation, but you 
just never know where it is going to crop up.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  There is a lot of legislation coming 
out.  Steve, we have to go quickly to the break, but do you 
think if there was -- so many of our examples are school-related. 
Would school choice help wipe out some of this 
need, or is that only a small drop in the bucket here?

<p>

MR. KNUDSEN:  Well, school choice is a vital 
component in my belief, because it says to the parents, we 
are giving you back an opportunity to be the guardian and 
control the upbringing of your child.  It puts 
responsibility back in the parents' courts. So it gives 
them the ball to play with.

<p>

MS. DEALY:  It acknowledges that parents know best 
for their individual children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: In particular, for their own school choices.

<p>

MS. DEALY:  They know the best environment in 
which that child is going to learn and flourish, because 
parents know intimately their children as individuals, 
rather than as just names on a roll or numbers in somebody's
book.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  The government has their Social 
Security Number, and they are here to help you.

<p>

When we come back, we are going to talk more about 
parents' rights and responsibilities.

<p>

[Videotape of Representative Steve Largent follows.]

<p>

MR. LARGENT:  Most of the opposition to the 
Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act comes from the 
education bureaucracy.  Just a little interesting fact for 
you to know as to how I view or why I think the opposition 
is there from the education bureaucracy, and that manifests 
itself either through the NEA or the PTA, librarians, those 
are the folks that I guess have been in our office most 
often, is that in 1930 in this country there were 130,000 
individual school boards, school boards that were manned by 
moms and dads making decisions on the local level as to what 
their children were to be taught and how they were to be 
taught it in their schools.

<p>

In 1993, there are now not 130,000 school boards; 
there are 15,000 school boards.  So what has happened is in 
this turf battle for determining who raises our children, 
the education bureaucracy has clearly gained a lot of 
ground.  When you replace 130,000 school boards of moms and 
dads making decisions on the local level and reduce it down 
to 15,000 school boards, the education bureaucracy fills the 
vacuum very, very quickly.

<p>

So when you introduce a bill in Congress like the 
Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act, whose purpose it 
is to strengthen the ability of families, those moms and 
dads, to make decisions for their children, then you are 
going to get resistance from the people that had filled the 
vacuum, which in this case is the education bureaucracy.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>, and we are talking about 
parents' rights and responsibilities, whether or not the 
government recognizes them, respects them.  What kind of 
authority do parents really have?

<p>

I am sitting here with some very leading 
individuals at the state level who have worked on this both 
at their legislative level and now are interested in what is 
happening at the federal level.

<p>

We were talking a little bit earlier about the 
Rights and Responsibilities Act, and you brought up a very 
interesting concern that the people of Illinois have.

<p>

MR. CLARK:  Well, one of the first questions is 
why do we need this kind of legislation at all, and the 
point we try to make is that we are trying to reclaim some 
lost ground.  There are a couple of Supreme Court decisions 
from back in the 1920s, 1923 and 1925, that really lay out 
this concept very clearly, but state courts and some federal 
courts have ignored those as they have made decisions.

<p>

So the idea is to put this amendment at the state 
level forward to start a debate, number one, and get people 
to rethink the role of parents versus the state in who 
should be raising the kids, and then secondly, to give 
parents a whole new standing legally by amending a state 
level constitution.  Nothing happens immediately if an 
amendment is approved.  What has to happen then, as each 
school district and as each court case comes up, the judge 
or the school administrators have to rethink, now, what are 
we doing that might be in conflict with that?

<p>

I like to make the analogy of the Freedom of 
Speech in the Bill of Rights, because nobody tells you what 
that means on a day-to-day basis, yet intuitively over the 
decades we have evolved a body of law that says what that 
is, and by putting this amendment in the state constitution, 
we can see that we will get more consistent decisions out of 
state and federal courts.

<p>

MR. KNUDSEN:  That reclaiming of lost ground that 
Joe talks about, it is kind of like human nature is like 
water.  We pick the course of least resistance.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

And what is happening here is that the government 
comes in and says let us take over.  Let us do more of this.  
We will pick where your kids are educated.  We will pick how 
to teach them sex ed.  I mean, how many parents really 
relish the idea of talking about sex with their teenage 
kids, you know, raise your hand, uh uh.  I mean, it is 
something you do not look forward to, and so the state says, 
hey, we will do that for you, and a lot of parents go, whew, 
man, right on, I'm out of here.  So what we have to do is 
come back and reaffirm the responsibilities that parents 
have, the rights that come along with those, and begin to 
reeducate parents as to their proper role, because what we 
are doing right now is we are taking that path of least 
resistance, and as long as the government continues to offer 
us more services to raise our kids, unfortunately a lot of 
parents are choosing --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  To allow them to do it.

<p>

MS. DEALY:  It is too easy.

<p>

MR. SCIANNA:  It goes back to this whole notion 
that people are afraid that this Parental Rights and 
Responsibility Act is going to redefine what it means to be 
a parent, and in fact, it is not going to redefine what it 
means to be a parent, because that definition has never 
really changed.  Our culture has tried to change the 
definition, but we need to go back to the original 
definition of what it is to be a parent, and that is to take 
the responsibility for our own children.

<p>

I grew up in a small town where everyone knew 
everyone, and if I was in trouble, before I got home my 
mother knew that I was in trouble, because everyone knew who 
Beverly and Charlie's kids were.  As a matter of fact, I 
accused my mother of working for the CIA, and as I got 
older, I found out that she did not work for the CIA; in 
fact, they worked for her.  She was the boss.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

But we need to get back to that original 
definition and the responsibilities associated with being a 
parent, and I think that is what this act tries to do is to 
bring that back.

<p>

MR. KNUDSEN:  Paul touched on something, I think, 
that is crucial to the debate, and that is the sense of 
community.  The key thing that he said was that when he was 
in trouble and someone saw him, who did they call?  They did 
not call social services.  They called his parents.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Right.

<p>

MR. KNUDSEN:  They went to the authority, and they 
called the parents, and they said here is what is going on.  
I think we need to refoster that.  We have lost the sense of 
aunts and uncles, because we move a lot.  Someone said the 
other day garage door openers were the worst thing that 
could happen to a community, because we open the door as we 
are driving in and we close it before we get out of our car.  
We no longer wave to the people that live to one side -- we 
do not even know the people that live to one side or the 
other of us.  So we need to get back to understanding that 
sense of community, to understand that the parent has the 
authority over the kids, and that we do not call social 
services, we call the parent.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  When we come back, we are going to 
hear more about the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act 
and from the state leaders who are helping make it happen.
Stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to more <i>Straight Talk 
from the Family Research Council</i>. We are talking about 
parental rights and responsibilities and are we having some 
of both or neither.  Frankly, this particular issue is part 
and parcel of a lot of momentum.

<p>

What are you seeing on that?

<p>

MR. PAULTON:  Well, yes, I think what we have been 
talking about here really reminds us that this bill, this 
whole parental rights movement, goes to the heart of the 
conservative movement as a whole.  That is, less government, 
more individual responsibility.  When I come back to 
Washington from South Dakota, walk around and see the 
buildings, row upon row of government buildings, I am just 
reminded of all of the work that politicians have done to 
try to solve our problems, and they have just created more.  
We need to turn more authority back to the local level, and 
the most local level of all is parents.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Why do you think that is, though, 
because clearly the government says the family is 
dysfunctional -- you know, that is such a yuppie word -- and 
the government needs to step in.  Why do you think some of 
this has kind of created problems?

<p>

MR. PAULTON:  Well, I believe it actually has been 
kind of a self-perpetuating cycle.  The government sees a 
problem and maybe has a legitimate concern about it, perhaps 
oversteps their boundaries a bit, and you know, the welfare 
examples would be classic in that sense that problems are 
addressed, perhaps even with good intentions, and yet the 
result is people turn to government even more, rely on 
government even more.  We need to at least make that 
reminder, put that reminder out there, that individual 
responsibility, parental responsibility, is ultimate.

<p>

MR. CLARK:  You just said a key phrase:
individual responsibility.  I look at my generation and what 
was going on in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s and how many 
people made individual choices to do what is right for me as 
a person and not for the larger community or for the family, 
and one of the best responses I have heard to that "It Takes 
a Whole Village" was coined by my predecessor in this job, 
Penny Poulin[?] back in Illinois who said it takes a whole 
family, and when you understand that and you take on the 
responsibility as an individual for your role in that 
family, then a lot of these problems go away.

<p>

MR. SCIANNA: But you know, Steve brought up a 
good point earlier about the whole idea of taking the path 
of least resistance, but many times our government has 
created this situation that causes the parents to take that 
path of least resistance.  I know Linda talked about the 
necessity in many homes where it is no longer a choice for 
there to be two parents working, and so you begin to see now 
that --

<p>

MS. DEALY:  If we were not taxed at the level we 
are, there would not be a need for many mothers to be -- 

<p>

MR. SCIANNA:  So the need for daycare early and 
often comes up, and the whole idea now you find parents who 
are looking for not only that before care and after care, 
but they are also becoming proponents of year-round 
schooling, because, hey, that is a lot more convenient.  The 
thing that concerns me most about that -- we have heard the 
examples given here -- is that the school has been the 
vehicle by which parental rights have been taken away the 
most.  So we need to really -- and someone talked about it 
earlier, the individual responsibility and accountability 
that comes with us as parents to be informed.

<p>

Joe, you touched on that, for people to go back 
and to know what has gone on in their local school district.  
The best way to change this is not Washington, D.C. down, 
even though this is important.  But the best way to change 
it is for people to go to their local school district where 
they know the school board members' names, the 
superintendent's name, the principal's name.  I mean, they 
live in that same community with those folks and address it 
there.

<p>

MR. BROOKS:  Kristi, one of the things that I 
think we forget when we are looking at public policy, and I 
am an economist, so I tend to focus in this direction more 
than maybe some others, is the old adage, follow the money.  
One of the things that we have touched on is that these 
institutions have been built by government and by 
politicians over the last 30 or 40 years, and they are 
large, and they are powerful, and they get billions of 
dollars a year, a lot of which they use back to lobby to 
keep those funds.  So as powerful organizations, they have a 
vested self-interest to protect, and we see a lot of these 
proposals coming from these organizations, and as you 
pointed out, I believe you said you had 10 people opposing 
you from the education establishment on your parental rights 
bill in Illinois.

<p>

MR. CLARK:  That is the lobbyists, yes.

<p>

MR. BROOKS:  Now that is an example of the power 
that they can wield.  So we have to look at that, follow the 
money.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  At taxpayer expense, the power that 
they wield against us, with our money.

<p>

MR. BROOKS:  Right, at taxpayer expense.  And we 
have to point that out, and we have to show that what we are 
dealing with is people who are not acting necessarily in our 
best interests or in the best interests of our children, but 
in their best interests, because they are trying to protect 
their jobs, protect their institutions that have been built 
up over the years.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Right.  See, it is interesting when 
you look at it.  The average private school education costs 
about $2,000, $1,500 to $2,000, while the average public 
school education is like $5,000 to $6,000, and as a matter 
of fact, in the District of Columbia where we have metal 
detectors protecting us from ourselves, the average 
education here is around $9,000 per child.  Yet, if you look 
at the numbers at Catholic schools or private schools or 
even the homeschoolers in terms of SAT scores, blowing it 
out of the water.  Why then -- you know, and I ask this of 
you -- why then are we not more in favor of things like 
educational choice, which give power to the parents when we 
see the impact?

<p>

MS. DEALY:  Well, each of us are.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

We here are.  So the question you are asking is 
why is the education establishment not more in favor?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  But why is society not in favor of 
giving parents authority?

<p>

MS. DEALY:  That just highlights the reality of 
what their interest is.  Their interest is not the quality 
education of the child or the student.  Their interest is in 
the whole larger picture, which is either self-perpetuation, 
protecting their own jobs and advancement, or they have a 
larger sociological agenda, to have an impact on the -- and 
they are all in there together, and I always have to be 
careful when I talk about that, because I do not want to 
discount -- when I am making complaints against education, I 
am talking about the educational bureaucracy and the 
leadership of the teachers' unions and things like that, not 
the individual teachers who too often are so oppressed by 
their own establishment that they are in there being -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Well, they are the ones that are 
forced to do these things.

<p>

MS. DEALY:  They can be well-intentioned and have 
the best interests of the child but be held in a 
stranglehold to be able to be effective as they would like 
to be as teachers.

<p>

MR. SCIANNA:  It is not quality.  It is the 
control.  As a matter of fact, the whole issue of school 
choice, there have been situations where minorities, once 
they have been informed properly what school choice means, 
an overwhelming majority of minorities are in favor of 
school choice.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Oh, they are more in favor than the 
average population.

<p>

MS. DEALY:  We have a case in Los Angeles.  There 
is a private school that was started by a family in south 
central Los Angeles that there is a waiting list literally 
hundreds of children long to get into this school, because 
they can see the delineation between the education that 
these children are receiving there, and this is a school 
absolutely run on a shoestring, yet the parents are involved 
in the school; the people who are running it are so 
dedicated to making an impact and a positive difference in 
these students' lives, they are tripping over children who 
want to get into this school.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Well, I think it is clear that this 
is a conversation we are going to need to continue, and I 
would like to thank all my guests for being with us.  When 
we come back, we will have more from <i>Straight Talk from the
Family Research Council</i>.

<p>

[Videotape of Representative Steve Largent follows.]

<p>

MR. LARGENT:  If you want to be for children, then 
you need to be for parents, because nobody is for children 
more than their parents are, and that is why we have 
introduced the Parental Rights and Responsibility Act.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you for joining us at <i>Straight 
Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. If you would like to 
receive more information about the Family Research Council, 
tonight's guests, or the crucial issues affecting you and 
your family, please call us at 1-800-225-4008.

<p>

Next week, we will alert parents to a new affront
against America's children as we discuss a recent court case 
which opened the world of pornography to our children over 
the Internet.  Are we losing the battle to protect our 
children from pornography in cyberspace?  We will find out 
when we bring you more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. Thanks for watching.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the
Family Research Council</i>. I am your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i> we are discussing one of the latest
in technological advancements, the Internet.  You have
probably heard about your home computer as a link to all the
information in the world's databases, but we will be taking
a look at how cyberspace allows pornography to enter your
home and reach your children through just a few strikes on
the keyboard.

<p>

Pro-family groups found some solace in the 
Communications Decency Act which made it more difficult for 
children to come across indecent material in cyberspace.
Yet, just a few weeks ago, a Pennsylvania federal court
blocked enforcement of that law, saying that it limits First 
Amendment protection of the Net.

<p>

Tonight, we will be talking to those who work 
closely with this case and continue to do battle for your 
children.

<p>

But first, let's get the inside scoop on Capitol 
Hill.  Marty Dannenfelser runs the Family Research Council's
Government Relations shop after years on the Hill.  He works 
daily with congressmen and senators, staying up to the 
minute on the issues affecting your family.  We will hear 
about the key issues that the House and the Senate are 
attempting to highlight and to avoid as we near the election 
and as we take you Behind the Headlines.

<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Marty, thank you so much for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.  You have worked on 
the Hill for a lot of years and had a chance to see a lot of 
Congress sessions come to a close, and in particular to see 
the session transition into an election, most particularly a 
Presidential election.

<p>

What does that mean about the importance of the 
issues at play now, given that the session is ending, but we 
are going into a Presidential election?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, it makes the whole 
dynamic very politically charged, and there is a lot of 
activity that takes place that seems to advance the agenda 
of either candidate by the members of the party of that 
candidate, and it is producing quite a conflict from issues 
like health care and welfare and the whole spending process, 
the appropriations process.  All of this, I think, really is 
being worked out against the backdrop of the impending 
Presidential election.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: In a Presidential election cycle, it 
seems that some of the issues are brought up more 
philosophically, just to argue about the issues that either 
candidate cares about, rather than really substantively.
Are these issues at play really significant?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER:  There is some of that. You 
certainly see that in this whole debate about whether or not 
we are going to have medical savings accounts in the health 
care bill and whether or not we are going to link welfare 
reform and Medicaid reform and so on.  So much of that is 
tied to the arguments that the various candidates have made.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What issues are still at play that affect families?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, one of the big issues 
that is still at play is the Defense of Marriage Act, and 
people may be aware of the situation in Hawaii where the 
Hawaiian courts are expected to mandate that the state has 
to recognize same sex marriages as legitimate marriages, and 
under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. 
Constitution, the other states, all 49 of them, may have to 
recognize those marriages.

<p>

So Congress has a bill to protect states who 
choose not to recognize those marriages and also defines 
marriage as a legal union between a man and a woman for 
federal purposes for the impact that would have on federal 
benefits and so on.  So that is a very important thing.  The 
President has said that he would sign the bill.

<p>

We now have a situation where Senator Ted Kennedy 
is trying to introduce another issue into the mix, what is 
called the Employment Nondiscrimination Act, and he has 
indicated that he will try to attach that to the Defense of 
Marriage Act, which could muddy the waters, and our hope is 
that those two issues would be kept separate and that we 
will get that bill, the Defense of Marriage Act, passed this 
year.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bill Clinton, as we know, has been 
very pro-homosexual in the agenda that he has embraced, and 
yet he came forward in favor of the Defense of Marriage, as 
did Bob Dole.  It would have seemed like the right thing to 
do would have been to force the Defense of Marriage Act 
through quickly and have them put their electoral votes 
where their mouth is.  Why didn't that happen?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER:  It has been partly complicated 
by the legislative schedule.  There is a desire in the House 
to move the appropriation bills.  They have to pass 13 
appropriation bills, and they had hoped to get most of them 
done before this July 4 recess, and I think they have about 
seven or eight of them done.  So that has been pushed off.
So we do hope to see some movement on the bill in the month 
of July.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Is there a lot of sentiment in 
support of the Defense of Marriage Act?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER:  We sense that it is very 
strongly supported by people across the board.  There is 
some activity by the Human Rights Campaign Fund and some 
other pro-homosexual groups to try to derail it and try to 
suggest that it is political, but it is very necessary, 
because we do feel that this court decision in Hawaii could 
come down as early as September, and in the absence of this 
bill, we could see all kinds of executive action by the 
administration to start implementing this and forcing the 
states to recognize these marriages and forcing federal 
programs to pay benefits to the so-called spouses of these 
individuals.  So it is very important that this legislation 
be enacted before Congress leaves town.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Another of the issues at play has 
been the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act which was to deal 
with a very limited late term abortion procedure that we 
know from the doctor that invented has been used against 
healthy viable children 7, 8, and 9 months of gestation.
When it first went through, it went through by wide margins, 
and Bill Clinton vetoed it.  There has been talk about 
bringing it back, possibly for a veto override before the 
end of the summer.  Is this a possibility?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Yes, the timing is not nailed 
in concrete just now, but we do expect possibly by the end 
of the summer that that will come up, and there are efforts 
to educate the public, because there is a need to turn 
around some votes in the Senate and also to hold onto those 
votes in the House.

<p>

There were two-thirds margins in the House in the 
two votes that they have taken on this legislation, but 
there will be a lot of pressure, particularly on Democratic 
members, to defend the President and to argue that his 
position regarding this health exception, which we would 
argue would make it abortion on demand, that those type of 
issues are already accounted for in the bill to protect the 
life of the mother when her life is threatened by some 
serious health complication.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There have been some recent 
developments on the partial birth abortion ban sentiment 
come up in the military, and something very unusual has 
happened. Could you tell us a little bit more about that?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Yes, a directive went out from 
the Pentagon to the military chaplains, telling them that 
they could not participate in the distribution of postcards 
that have been prepared by the Catholic bishops, and there 
is going to be a massive distribution of these postcards at 
Catholic churches throughout the country this weekend, and 
they have been told that in the military churches that they 
cannot distribute these postcards because they suggest that 
this is political, and it is interesting that the people who 
are the top decision makers at the Pentagon are, in fact, 
political appointees.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: They are appointed by the President.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: They are ultimately appointed 
by the President.  So that raises some real questions.  The 
whole idea of separation of church and state is interesting 
in this discussion, too, because the ACLU and many liberal 
activists are constantly invoking this mantra about church 
and state.

<p>

What the founding fathers meant in that area was 
that the state should stay out of religion, and this seems 
to be a classic example of the state interfering in 
religious expression and in free speech expression, as well.
So we are very disturbed about this action and really feel 
that it has the appearance of being politically motivated 
when, in fact, the postcard campaign is really geared 
towards protecting innocent life, and churches often speak 
out on public policy issues, and to try to gag them in this 
particular case is really a very troubling action.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: At the grassroots level, there is a 
lot of support for the Defense of Marriage Act and the 
Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act, and another issue that has 
brought a lot of attention by average Americans has been the 
Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act.  What is the 
status on that?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, that has had hearings in 
both the House and Senate and has a good number -- I think 
over 160 co-sponsors in the House.  There is quite a 
coalition amassed against it, largely teachers unions, child 
welfare advocates, and the like.  We believe that they see 
this as really threatening their agenda and their control 
over the agenda, and they argue that this is somehow going 
to protect parents who would abuse their children when, in 
fact, the legislation has specific language in it to make 
clear that it does not provide any protection for child 
abusers.

<p>

The education lobby, the National Education 
Association and some of the other school boards and parent 
teacher groups, are arguing that this could somehow disrupt 
the day-to-day activities in the classroom, but we feel that 
is a red herring, that the National Education Association 
and others have had a history of usurping parents rights, 
and they want to continue business as usual.

<p>

So this is the type of issue where there is a good 
deal of public support, very strong support, for the 
principle that parents' rights should take precedence over 
the state.  Now certainly there are instances where parents 
neglect their responsibilities, and then someone has to step 
in on behalf of the children, but in those cases where 
parents are exercising their responsibility, the state 
should not be interfering with the day-to-day guidance that 
parents are trying to give their children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: In an election year, one of the 
topics that every politician wants to discuss is tax relief, 
and of course, they are always for that.  Yet, despite a lot 
of support, the $500 per child tax credit has not happened.  
Is that going to come up again before the election?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER:  It may come up in some form.
Of course, it has already passed the Congress and has been 
vetoed by the President.  There has been some discussion of 
linking it with welfare and Medicaid reform, although that 
is starting to look less likely.  They might just do welfare 
by itself or Medicaid by itself.

<p>

Our concern is if they do not put it in a package 
that they are not going to have the savings in terms of how 
they calculate the budget numbers to get the $500 per child 
tax credit done, but there is still talk about them perhaps 
doing it as a freestanding bill, but the President has this 
situation where he does not like the Medicaid reform, and he 
would argue, I think, that if they do not get both of them 
done, well, we do not have the savings.  So I think it is 
something of a Catch-22 situation that is in front of us on 
that unfortunately.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  In all the issues that the grassroots has really been 
tracking, how would you order them for their importance in this cycle?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: I think the partial birth 
abortion issue really shows people how far we have come in 
the extreme abortion policy in this country.  I think many 
people have had the impression -- and some of the polls bear 
this out -- that abortion is only legal in the early stages 
of pregnancy for hard case situations, when in fact it is 
allowed virtually at any time for any reason, and to see a 
child going through the birth process, to be four-fifths of 
the way born and then stabbed in the back of the head and 
killed, that shocks people.

<p>

They had no idea that that was going on in this 
country and that that is the nature of the abortion license 
in this country that it has become that extreme.  So I think 
it is very important for people to realize how far this has 
gone, and I think that will shake them up and start to focus 
on what are we going to do about this type of policy.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Marty, thank you so much for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER:  Glad to be here.  Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, 
<i>Straight Talk</i> begins our discussion of cyberporn.  How can 
we battle the lucrative pornography industry?  Stay tuned to 
hear how our guests answer that crucial question.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  In February, the Telecommunications 
Act of 1996 was signed into law by President Clinton.  Part 
of that act included the Communications Decency Act, which 
is simply a law that says adults have no right to knowingly 
give pornography to children over computer systems.  Well, 
the ACLU and other groups immediately filed a lawsuit saying 
that this is going to ruin our cherished freedom of free 
speech, and we have this drama played out in a federal court 
in Philadelphia.

<p>

The Supreme Court has said that we do not have to 
have that, that pornography is not a measure of our freedom.  
Rather, it is a sort of low-level type of speech that we 
need to tolerate at some levels, but certainly we do not 
need to have our children tolerate it.  Every time a new 
technology develops, first of all, pornographers rush in and 
exploit that technology, sometimes drive it, and then, 
secondly, the porn defenders come in and say, well, 
pornography law cannot apply in this technology certainly.  
Videos are different than magazines, and certainly 
pornography laws should not apply to videos.  That is what 
we heard in the early 1980s.

<p>

Well, that argument failed, and we have seen that 
with television, telephone, cable, and now we are seeing it 
with the computer and with the Internet.  So I believe that 
the challenges that are going on across the country are just 
the same challenges we have always seen and that our side 
will be successful.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Although success seems thwarted due 
to some Pennsylvania judges, our guests tonight continue 
their fight.  I would like to introduce Colby May, who is 
senior counsel in the Office of Governmental Affairs for the 
American Center for Law and Justice.  I would also like to 
welcome Bruce Taylor, who is president and chief counsel of 
the National Law Center for Children and Families.  Also 
with us is Cathy Cleaver, who is Director of Legal Studies 
for the Family Research Council and a frequent guest.
Welcome to all of you.

<p>

Let me start with a question that we asked right 
at the bump.  What can people do to protect their children 
from pornography on the Internet, given some of the recent 
court rulings?  Is there any help from government, or is it 
going to be kind of a go fish world where you have to get 
your own kind of technology?

<p>

MR. MAY:  Well, at this point in time, it is kind 
of a go fish world.  I think this court relied very much on 
the idea that there were computer programs, software 
programs, available to protect or empower parents, and based 
upon that, they believe that that is the appropriate remedy, 
at least at this level.  Now, of course, I think you will 
find everybody here today probably disagrees with that and 
believes that certainly this ought to be appealed and is 
being appealed and ought to be reversed, but right now it is 
parents go out, get familiar with what programs are 
available, Surf Watch, et cetera, to protect your children, 
because right now the government is not going to step in and 
do that.

<p>

One of the things that they said in the case was 
that if industry had to help protect children from 
pornography that it would be a terrible barrier to overcome 
and an impossible barrier to overcome, and Cathy, you were 
writing about that recently.  Is this a barrier, a 
technological barrier, that the industry could not achieve, 
protecting children from pornography?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Not at all.  We know that there is 
simply a lack of will on the part of the industry, not a 
lack of ability, in coming up with ways to screen people, to 
decide whether they are an adult or a child, before you let 
them into a pornographic site.  We think that that will 
become increasingly clear as time passes that there are ways 
to protect consumers in cyberspace, there are new ways to 
protect amateur musicians who want to share their songs but 
not have their copyrights violated.  There ought to be a way 
with all this technology to put barriers up to protect 
children, and we believe there is a way.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What kind of things would happen?  I 
have heard things like photocopy your driver's license and 
mail it in for some kind of password so that you could prove 
your age.  What kind of barriers could be put up?

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  Well, the CDA, the law passed by 
Congress, anticipated that the industry could come up with a 
lot of different ways, that even users could come up with 
ways to protect themselves.  The law specifically allows for 
taking credit cards or adult PIN numbers.  But beyond that, 
there are a lot of new technologies being developed like 
digital IDs and smart cards.

<p>

There are protocols being written for the next 
generation of the Internet operating system that could 
include a code that says you are an adult, or I am an A and 
my kid is a C.  So anytime anyone showed up electronically 
at a Web page or at an Internet site, they would 
automatically be known to that site as an adult or a child, 
and pictures that are inappropriate for children could be 
blocked, and adults could get right in.

<p>

So there are a lot of ways that technically they 
could do it with just a tweaking of the program, and that is 
what the CDA gave immunity for the industry to develop, and 
the industry said we want to be good Samaritans; give us the 
immunity to help parents and help children, and Congress 
gave it to them.

<p>

Now they are challenging the law because they say 
they do not want to go through that extra -- although we 
think the industry is going to fight among themselves to 
come up with certain kinds of technological abilities to 
comply with this, so whether the industry likes it or not, 
somebody is going to develop a way to comply with the CDA, 
and when they do, they are going to get rich, and that is 
going to be the incentive to do it, whether America Online 
or Prodigy and CompuServe like it or not, and it is going to 
be easy to comply with the CDA, and then I think the courts 
will like the law.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  The important thing right now, 
though, is there is nothing in place.  Parents have to fend 
for themselves, and interestingly, shockingly, in 
Philadelphia the leading software blocking system admitted 
in court -- this is Surf Watch -- that they miss 800 
pornographic sites per month.  Those are 800 adult 
bookstores on-line that your child can get into without any 
barrier whatsoever, and that is with a protective software 
device.  So parents, we cannot overemphasize how important 
it is for parents to either decide not to let their children 
on this new great technology, which is an awfully high price 
to pay for pornography.

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  And as you know, Kristi, the whole 
purpose of the lawsuit by the ACLU and the American Library 
Association and some of the big companies was to not have 
any obligations that they would have to fight about free 
speech.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  That is a really good point, because 
they are saying it is too much money.

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  It is self-interest.  It is too much 
problem.  But they did offer to the court, they said, you do 
not need to have a law, because we have all these software 
programs.  They offered the court Surf Watch, which they 
just started developing last year.  They dug it out of the 
dustbin.  It did not work when they played it for Congress.
It failed when they tried it in the court in Philadelphia.
It failed in New York.  It is the worst of the programs.
The second generations, we hope, are going to be better. As 
Colby mentioned, these software screening things and the Net 
Nannies and the Cyberpatrol and Rated PG and Library Safe 
and some of the newer generations are much more --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Much more effective.

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  Yes, they are going to be more 
effective, but parents are still at the mercy of somebody 
else who has found this pornography or who can block your 
kid, but that does not keep from finding it next door or at 
the school or at the library where they do not put these 
blocks on.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Or at another child's home whose parent is unaware.

<p>

MR. MAY:  And what is interesting is that the 
debate, it seems to me, needs to be on the responsibilities 
that people have that want to use this new technology.  We 
as a society and as a people have no problem in putting 
certain restrictions on in terms of responsibilities when 
you use cable systems, broadcast facilities, when you use 
common carriers through your phone lines and the like, and 
the idea that that same sense of balance and responsibility 
cannot apply by virtue of there being something so unique or 
so mysterious about the cyberworld that we cannot apply 
these same kind of restrictions, I find to be utterly 
unsupportable.

<p>

Frankly, I believe the Supreme Court will 
eventually reverse that and correct what this panel has done 
in Philadelphia, because quite honestly, while we all revere 
and love the First Amendment, we all recognize that as a 
people we care about ordered liberty and we care about 
people being responsible for the freedoms that they are 
given, and right now, for the court to have sort of usurped 
its judgment for the collective judgment of Congress and the 
President on this matter, if I were uninitiated to the 
ambiguities and confusions of the law, which unfortunately I 
am not -- I wish I was more innocent of it -- I would be 
wondering what in heaven's name is this court doing and why 
is it that the people cannot have an interest in protecting 
children that goes beyond the parent being responsible to go 
out and buy the software, become educated about how to apply 
it, how to install it, how to use it, and how to then 
monitor it to make sure your child or his friends have not 
gotten around it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It is a tough thing.  I think for 
people who are watching, they may not understand it.  What 
we are in essence saying is that we are free to pollute our 
cultural environment, and parents have to buy the gas masks.  
You know, we are not surprised about seat belt laws.  We are 
not surprised that there are scrubbers on a coal mine.  We 
are not surprised that the FDA says, oh, by the way, this 
has a poisonous side effect.  But somehow with something 
like pornography, we say let the buyer beware, and parents 
must stand at armed gates.

<p>

There is a lot of weight been placed on parents 
and on the technology, but this is not going to touch on the 
chat room phenomenon, is it?  There are limits to even the 
best of technology, aren't there?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Absolutely, and a key thing that I 
think people should understand about this recent ruling is 
that what this court has said in Philadelphia is that we are 
not even allowed to enact a law that says adults should not 
send pornography by email directly to a specific child.
That is how radical this decision is.  The court says it is 
unconstitutional to even try to do that.  We are sure the 
Supreme Court is going to overturn that portion of this 
court's ruling.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: To ask you one quick question before 
we go to the break, so things that you could not send the 
child in the mail, you can email?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Correct.

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  You can go to jail under any state 
law -- and state laws still apply, too.  I mean, this court 
just struck down parts of a federal statute, but state 
prosecutors can use state harmful to minors laws and state 
obscenity laws, and they should be doing that more often.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And the Internet is a haven for pedophiles.

<p>

<i>Straight Talk</i> brings you more after this 
commercial break.  Don't go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Tonight we are discussing 
pornography on the Internet, and I am joined by attorneys 
who filed briefs in the most recent cyberporn case out in 
Philadelphia:  Colby May, senior counsel in the Office of 
Governmental Affairs for the American Center for Law and 
Justice, Bruce Taylor, president and chief counsel of the 
National Law Center for Children and Families, and Cathy 
Cleaver, who is director of legal studies for the Family 
Research Council.  Welcome back.

<p>

You all have some impressive titles.  We were 
talking before about the world in which pedophiles now can 
operate on the computer system, and I think that is the 
thing that parents are most concerned about.  I mean, it is 
one thing if you are an adult and you click across something 
and you are offended and you can kill it, but as we were 
saying before, if you are a pedophile, you can email 
pornography to children that you could not mail through what 
email people call snail mail.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  That is correct, and what is equally 
disturbing is that, look, we know that pedophiles 
traditionally stalk kids in playgrounds.  Well, we know that 
computers are the child's playground of the 1990s.  That is 
where children play these days increasingly.  So it is a 
really toxic mix to have these playgrounds be a place where 
children are fair game to pedophiles.  It is very 
disturbing.

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  And it is hard to catch.  I mean, a 
pedophile sitting in his home in Portland, Oregon can hit on 
200 kids a day all over the country, and he can send nude 
pictures of himself or <i>Hustler</i> centerfold, and this court 
said that should be all right.  But Congress said it was a 
crime.  I think the Supreme Court is going to bring that 
crime back.  But it is a tough problem.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You were saying that as sort of a 
stalking on the Internet, and there are articles coming out 
regularly -- 

<p>

MR. MAY:  There have been articles coming out.
Fortunately portions of the law were upheld, and one of the 
portions was the use of computer networks and the like for 
stalking, and that is illegal under the Communications 
Decency Act, but what you have is the enticements and the 
ticklers that go out.

<p>

So as Bruce mentioned, I can send, as long as I do 
not engage in a dialogue with the minor child, I can send 
out material that would be enticing or otherwise interesting 
which I would then intend to be used in some pedophile ring 
or some other certainly illegal venture, and you now have 
given the pedophile or those that would use it for a very 
destructive person a great tool to do what?  To reach 
literally hundreds of children where before, without this 
electronic medium, they certainly would have no ability to 
do that, and the idea that this court believes that we 
cannot require that adults rein in their own impulses and 
own appetites to the point where when you are speaking to 
children and you know you are speaking to children, that you 
do not have indecent conversations, you do not transmit 
pornographic and indecent materials, frankly I do not think 
it is too much to ask, and I think once the American 
families and the voters understand that, they are going to 
realize -- wait just a moment.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Because it is our children we are talking about.

<p>

MR. MAY:  Absolutely.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, <i>Saturday Night Live</i> had a 
skit, I do not know if you all saw -- unfortunately my 
husband and I are late night people -- of a dirty old man in 
his underwear emailing in chat rooms.  He would pretend he 
was a little girl or a little boy and would lead a 
conversation in a chat room to a sexual way, and he was 
hanging out in kids' chat rooms, and the nature of the skit 
was these children trying to respond to these dirty 
questions not really understanding, you know, how funny it
was what the kids would say back.

<p>

But would that still -- this would seem to be 
still legal, this sort of interjecting sexual themes if you 
are not intending sex to occur.  Would our children not 
still be vulnerable to these chat room conversations?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: Our children now are completely 
vulnerable for any adult who wants to try his best to 
offend, to himself find some sort of sexual gratification by 
scaring or offending innocent children.  Right now, our 
hands are tied according to this Philadelphia court.  We 
must allow that to happen.  We have to stand silent.  Our 
laws have to be silent in front of this.

<p>

Recently, there was an article that talked about 
judges being our robed masters.  There is some telling truth 
to that sort of phrase.  These judges are out of touch if 
they think that is unconstitutional.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Some people look at the 
Communications Decency Act, to kind of take the other side 
for a moment, and say, look, if we start regulating speech, 
you know, today it is speech dealing with sex, tomorrow 
maybe it is speech dealing with our basic liberties, 
although it is hard to believe that Patrick Henry would have 
had a <i>Playboy</i> printing press in his basement.  But do you 
see a slippery slope here if we restrain pornography for our 
other speech freedoms?

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  That is one of our favorite 
arguments.  Both of us wrote briefs.  Cathy and I wrote a 
brief for FRC, National Law Center, Enough is Enough, the 
National Coalition for Protection of Children and Families.  
Colby wrote a brief with Jim Henderson for ACLJ.  In both of 
our briefs, we laid out for the court the legal decisions of 
the Supreme Court and the FCC where they said indecency 
applies to that kind of pornography that is sexually 
explicit material -- it has to be sex acts or sex organs -- 
that is patently offensive, that is intended to offend.  It 
has no serious value.  You know, it is the kind of stuff 
that is separated from serious literature and art like you 
find in museums or libraries.  It is not AIDS information.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: How is it separated?

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  Because of the way the courts have 
interpreted that term indecency.  They say if something is 
in Michelangelo's David or Ulysses or some classic work and 
it is not a sexually exploitive type of picture of sex or 
nudity, then it is not indecent, because indecency is not 
all sex and nudity; it is that patently inoffensive kind 
that is inappropriate for children.

<p>

So the court has already said -- and it reaffirmed 
it again last week in the cable decision -- that indecency 
does not apply to serious speech.  It is not AIDS 
information or medical textbooks.  So when the ACLU says, 
oh, this will ban the Venus de Milo, it is a ridiculous 
argument, because the courts have already taken it away.  
Now this panel of judges in Philadelphia bought all of that 
and almost as if they had never read the court decisions, 
and that is why we are more confident that the Supreme Court 
will reverse that, and even though we say, yeah, there are 
some software programs, and yes, parents can kick their kids 
off the Internet, our answer to that is Congress passed this 
law to make the Internet safe for kids and told adults if 
you want to have your own adult pornography, you can limit 
it to other adults.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You need to set it up and secure it.

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  And we think that we are going to 
keep fighting with more briefs in the Supreme Court and more 
activities in Congress and in the other courts until we get 
a law that is going to give kids an ability to use the 
Internet just as much as adults, and I think we will 
eventually win it.  It might take us a couple of years, but 
I think we are at least committed to fighting that until we 
get it done.

<p>

MR. MAY:  I would just add that the law here that 
we care about -- we love the First Amendment, we revere the 
First Amendment, we are engaged in a lot of First Amendment 
defense.  We certainly have done it in the pro-life context, 
representing protesters and that sort of thing for many, 
many years.

<p>

But this is a terrible problem which this court 
has just closed its eyes to and refused to realize that you 
are not talking about speech that it is protected to all 
citizens all the time, so the First Amendment implications 
are dramatically reduced.  We all the time define out what 
that is.

<p>

Here we mean -- first, let me say that there is no 
speech that is censored or struck that otherwise is, you 
know, black marker going through.  It simply says that it is 
regulated in that context, and they regulate speech all the 
time.

<p>

So here we are saying to the unique and special 
class of children which we as a people, as a society, care 
and understand need to have special needs and interests, we 
are going to require that adults -- what a surprise -- that 
adults act in responsible ways to make sure that when they 
engage in conversations or transmit material that is 
patently offensive and that the subject of which deals with 
sexual and excretory functions, and you do not direct that 
or engage in that kind of conversation with children.

<p>

That does not seem to me at any rate to be a 
particularly astounding or shocking proposition, and I think 
that is why I would respond to say it is not a slippery 
slope, because the nature of the conversations are not those 
that are automatically free willy-nilly protected to anyone 
and everyone.  Now adults can have it, but you cannot have 
it with children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Just for people to understand, there 
are places where speech is restricted.  I mean, even the 
bill of rights is a balancing of rights.  You cannot vote 
any time you want.  There is a day to vote.  You know, you 
cannot take a loaded weapon into the middle of a hospital 
just because you want to.

<p>

When we come back from the break, let's just talk 
a little bit more about the fact that speech is not the 
untouched right.  Everything is balanced out, and let's talk 
a little bit about where speech is restricted.

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will hear more 
about protecting our children from pornography.  Join us 
after this break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are back with more <i>Straight Talk
from the Family Research Council</i>, where we are talking about 
pornography on the Internet.  I am joined once again by 
three attorneys who are working diligently on this issue:
Colby May, Bruce Taylor, and Cathy Cleaver.

<p>

When we went into the break, we were talking about 
the fact that basically what you are saying with laws that 
deal with pornography, there are appropriate restrictions 
and, in particular, restrictions for our children, but I 
think a lot of people think of free speech and think that 
somehow our speech is unregulated.  Is the idea of keeping 
pornography from our children some new concept, or are there 
any restrictions on speech that people would be aware of?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Well, there are many restrictions on 
speech.  We do not have an absolute right to speak.  We 
cannot rent an X-rated movie to a child.  We cannot sell a 
pornographic magazine to a child.  Those are all 
restrictions on speech.  Then, of course, there are fraud 
and slander laws and laws in favor of the public safety that 
restricts speech, such as yelling "fire" in a crowded 
theater.  We can prohibit that.

<p>

Those are all limits on our First Amendment 
rights, but those are limits we embrace.  We think they are 
reasonable, and we understand we need those restrictions so 
that we know how to live together in a society.  If we allow 
people to exploit children in the name of the First 
Amendment, then that is the beginning of the destruction of 
a civilized society.

<p>

MR. MAY:  Yes, I mean, Bruce, it was interesting
as we went into the break, made the interesting observation
that the slippery slope actually works in the other
direction.  This is not a deterioration or erosion of the
First Amendment protections that we are talking about.  It
is actually flipping it the other way, and the erosion we
see is the protection of certain classes from certain kinds
of inappropriate and, certainly in this case, many cases,
illegal kinds of speech and material being provided to kids.
So we flip it the other way.

<p>

So all of a sudden it will be, well, I can go even
if I am a minor and rent that X-rated video, or I can go buy 
that X-rated book or X-rated magazine even if I am a minor.
That is the slope moving in the other direction, and that
ought to be what we are concerned about.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Do you guys see the schizophrenia in 
the nanny state which is going to make curfews and is going 
to give you all kinds of information on sex and is going to 
tell you a million things, but then it is a restrictive 
atmosphere in government today.  You know, we are going to 
punish parents if the kids screw up, we are going to 
communicate drivers' issues to you -- this is how you drive 
a car -- we are going to communicate voting restrictions, we 
are going to communicate drinking restrictions, but no 
speech restrictions?  I mean, do you guys see any 
strangeness in their attitude on that?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  I think part of that is from, 
frankly, I think the ACLU has won the public debate on that 
to a large extent.  The ACLU has been able to convince 
enough people that if we touch speech, then our civilization 
will be destroyed, that people are very leery.  I mean, even 
conservatives, Christians, they think, gosh, we cannot touch 
speech.  Then we will not be able to share our faith or 
something.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Then why not faith speech, though?
I mean, the same ACLU that says pornography is appropriate 
for children and embraces pedophilia kinds of information 
for children says that prayer in school will destroy 
America.  I mean, I know you have had a lot of experience 
with that, Colby.

<p>

MR. MAY:  Well, it is one of the freedoms in the 
First Amendment.  The free speech clause, the free press, 
all that sort of thing, they are great champions of and sort 
of this let it all hang out, who cares, sort of thing, but 
when you get to the religion clauses, the establishment and 
the exercise clauses, they have risen the establishment
clause to the point where it just gobbled up free exercise.
So the idea that in public, at least in public, I could go 
out and share my faith and say I believe in Jesus Christ or 
I am a follower of Mohammed or whatever the particular case 
may be, oh-oh, the Republic is at stake; no, you cannot do 
that, that is a real problem, and they refuse to see that 
there are free speech elements to that and that they ought 
to be on the same side in that context as they are out there 
arguing in other contexts on the free speech question.

<p>

But they do not, and it is one of those great 
ironies and one of those great inconsistencies that 
intellectuals everywhere seem to be able to deal with and 
just put in a different pocket and never be concerned about 
and go right on, and that is unfortunately what they have 
done.

<p>

MR. TAYLOR: You know, it is an odd thing that the 
ACLU even a few years ago -- everybody thought that they 
were a bunch of kooks, because they always had such radical 
opinions.  They wanted to legalize child porn and obscenity 
and drugs and guns, and they want to impose sex education 
and certain things on the public and take away the rights of 
parents to teach their kids, and yet they want to defend the 
pornographers.

<p>

What we essentially are doing with Congress and 
the courts is saying let's not change our laws.  The ACLU 
wants to repeal all the obscenity, child porn, harmful to 
minors, indecency laws.  We are saying we have had them for 
100 years.  We have never had nudity and sex on American 
television and radio; they want to put it on.  We have never 
let kids into porno movies or buy <i>Hustler</i> magazines.  They 
want to make that available.  They want to put pornography 
in the libraries.  I mean, they are fighting the revolution 
to change it.

<p>

All we are doing is saying we want to keep the 
laws that we have, and the Congress and the CDA merely 
extended the same protections that kids have in every other 
medium, print, electronic, radio, broadcasting, telephone, 
they just extended that to the Internet and said what you 
cannot sell a kid in a convenience store or you cannot show 
them on a street corner or you cannot beam to him on a 
radio, you cannot put on the Internet.  That is not a 
difference in law.  It is just the same law.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bruce, what is the status now of the 
Communications Decency Act?  We had this three-judge panel.
What is going to happen next?

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  It is on a fairly fast track.  The 
government filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Supreme 
Court.  We kind of skipped the court of appeals.  The 
government will file a brief telling the court about the 
case.  The plaintiff, the ACLU, will file a brief saying 
don't hear this case.  The Supreme Court will, sometime this 
fall, either decide to send the case back down to the trial 
court and tell them, listen, you got this all wrong, start 
over, or they will hear the case and then come out with an 
opinion, and we think they will say the same thing if they 
come out with an opinion.  There is also another challenge 
like this in New York that will probably come out with their 
opinion within the next month or something.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  An appeals court?

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  No, it is another three-judge federal 
court in New York City that is hearing the same kind of 
challenge Philadelphia did.  I kind of think the New York 
court will come out with a different opinion than 
Philadelphia did.  Philadelphia was pretty radical.  I think 
the New York court will be more careful, and I think that 
between those two cases the Supreme Court will recognize 
that there are some serious issues here and send the cases 
back for them to take another look at it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Just for people to understand one 
more time, what was the most radical thing that came out of 
this three-judge panel, because I am not sure people 
understand.  They understand the Communications Decency Act 
was to apply to the Internet, and in particular, your 
concern was pornography.  What was the most radical thing 
about what the three judges said?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  I think we each have our favorite 
worst parts of this opinion.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

The answer is my favorite worst horrible part of 
the opinion is when the judges said that any speech 
regulation on this Internet would ruin it, would destroy the 
Internet.  My response is any speech?  No child pornography 
regulation?  We cannot protect consumers in cyberspace?  You 
know, this is a sacred realm that cannot be touched by law.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So I can lie about maybe drug use on 
the Internet.  Yes, you can use lye in your eyes.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  So I think that reveals that these 
judges are just off kilter.

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  My thing is that we told the court to 
interpret indecency like the FCC and the Supreme Court does 
to apply to unprotected pornographic harmful stuff for kids, 
and the court instead bought the ACLU's argument that 
indecency means museum pieces, works of literature and art, 
AIDS information, and science and medical textbooks, and it 
almost looks so absurd for the court to have the power to 
limit the reach of indecency to the kind of material that 
would not be unconstitutional, and instead in their 
liberalism, they tried to criminalize all the conduct that 
they thought should be the most protected.

<p>

It is almost like -- I don't know what they are 
smoking, but it was an odd decision in that regard, because 
they could have fixed everything they said was broken, and 
yet they broke it even more.

<p>

MR. MAY:  Well, my own personal favorite was when 
Chief Judge Sloviter[?] said that the Internet was the most 
important development for direct democracy where you could 
have multi-point communications in real-time with multipoint 
other points and have this ongoing discussion, and in 
the reality of the ongoing discussion, we have this 
incredible invigoration of democracy.

<p>

She described this as chaos, and therefore, in 
order to make sure that we preserve the chaos of the 
Internet, we have to make sure that there are no speech 
restrictions.  This is a speech restriction; it is out.  For 
me, I just found that to be absurd, because we talk about 
ordered liberty in this country.  We talk about 
responsibility in the same breath for which you talk about 
freedom, and the idea that it is chaos and that that somehow 
is the spawning ground for American democracy I find to be 
astoundingly silly.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  A rather narrow reading of history.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: Right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gary Bauer, President of the Family 
Research Council, made the interesting point after this case 
that if the Internet pollutes itself with pornography and 
all kind of insanity and false speech and 40-year-old men 
masquerading as 5-year-old girls, that eventually, rather 
than being the communications tool it is proclaimed to be, 
it will kill it, because people, families and people who 
might really use it, are going to get out.

<p>

Do you think that that is a realistic assessment?

<p>

MR. TAYLOR: I think that is why Congress passed 
the law, because just like they passed an indecency law 
saying you cannot put indecency on radio and television 60 
years ago to make TV and radio available to every home, and 
we put restrictions to protect kids in videos and magazines 
and everything else so industry can survive and so can kids, 
if the Internet becomes so toxic and unfriendly to children 
that they cannot use it safely, then what is it going to be 
in another 10 years that the next generation that could 
benefit the most will be able to use it the least?

<p>

So Congress was intending to open up the Internet 
to kids to be able to use it, not to close it, and that is 
why if it is only good for pornography -- if pornography is 
essential to the Internet, then it is not worth keeping, but 
if the Internet is good for everything else, then they will 
figure out a way to put pornography in its place so it does 
not ruin the Internet from being a universal communication.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Not to mention the majority of 
citizens in our country, women are a great minority on the 
Internet right now.  I wonder whether that has anything to 
do with the fact that pornography is completely free-wheeling. 
It always depicts women and degrades women, and 
most people on-line now are adult males making over $50,000.
It is somewhat of an elite group.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is, isn't it?

<p>

I have to thank my guests.  We are going to have 
to have you all back, especially after the next ruling.

<p>

When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shares more about 
the plight of America's families. Don't go away.

<p>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. You may have recognized one of 
tonight's guests from her appearances on nationwide news 
broadcasts.  Tonight, we will bring you a short clip from 
one of her more challenging appearances on CNN's <i>Crossfire</i>,
debating ACLU president Nadine Strassen[?]. Let's take a 
look as we bring you some Homefront News.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Look, in 1985, the ACLU said that 
child pornography is a sacred text that ought to be freely 
traded with no restrictions whatsoever.  At least we can say 
for the ACLU that they are consistent.  But what we have 
here is a --

<p>

MS. STRASSEN:  Cathy, I defend your --

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: -- either indecency or harmful to 
minor situation.  Let's look at reality.

<p>

MS. STRASSEN:  I would like to, but you are in a fantasy world.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Laws to protect children have been 
widely -- by liberals and conservatives -- under your 
agenda, Nadine, it is the bully who wins.  We care about 
children and about protecting children from pornography.  We 
are not talking about adults with this legislation.  We are 
talking about protecting children.  There is a wide 
consensus that the government has a role.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk</i> continues after the 
break.  Stay with us to hear how you can get more 
information regarding critical issues affecting you and your 
family.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you for joining us here at 
<i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. If you
would like to receive more information about the Family 
Research Council, tonight's guests, or the topics discussed,

<p>

Next week, we will share key information regarding 
the Defense of Marriage Act and some sound reasoning from a 
variety of experts on why marriage should not be destroyed 
and reshaped to include homosexual couples.  You will not

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>.  I am your host, Kristi Hamrick.  Tonight 
on <i>Straight Talk</i> we are presenting some very important facts 
about homosexuality and marriage.  You will hear from 
experts who have examined the ramifications of destroying 
marriage to reshape it with same sex unions.  From 
psychiatrists to educators, Family Research Council brought 
experts together in a briefing on Capitol Hill to present 
their findings to the media and our country's legislators.

<p>

We will also see a clip from the news conference 
where grass roots leaders presented their views on changing 
marriage.  Why is this an issue?  Because aggressive 
homosexual activists have tried to change America through a 
court case now pending before liberal judges in Hawaii.  
That case could come down in August.  If you want to 
understand this radical change, stay tuned.

<p>

But first we bring you Gary Bauer, president of 
the Family Research Council, a long term expert on values 
discussions and a leading conservative political analyst.  
Let's here Gary's opening remarks.

<p>

[Videotape of Defense of Marriage Briefing,  broadcast July 
2, 1996, follows.]

<p>

MR. BAUER:  As the 20th century draws to a close, 
the United States finds itself in the middle of some fairly 
profound debate on a whole host of issues, and I suppose 
that is the way it should be in a democratic republic like 
ours.  The people ought to be debating the most important 
issues of the day.

<p>

We all are aware of the great debate taking place 
on the size of government and how big Washington ought to 
be.  As conservatives, we believe that Washington is too 
large and that bureaucracy is too extensive and it ought to 
be cut back.  There is a great debate taking place on the 
question of taxation, and once again, I think the issue is 
pretty clear.  I believe that the American people, American 
families, American workers, are overtaxed and that 
Washington, D.C. is overfed and needs to tighten its belt.

<p>

We are having a gigantic debate at the end of this 
century on the question of America's role in the world.  We 
were reminded of that again this week when once again flag-draped 
caskets came back from Saudi Arabia.  Whether it is 
Bosnia or Haiti or Somalia or Saudi Arabia, Americans will 
be debating for a long time our proper place in the world, 
where it is we should show the flag, and for what we will 
ask young men and women to pay the ultimate sacrifice.

<p>

These are all important issues.  They are all 
things that in a democratic republic the people must debate.  
But there is also a whole group of issues that are also 
important and profound, and I would argue in many ways even 
more profound than the issues I just mentioned to you.

<p>

They are issues that relate to values and to 
virtue and how it is that free men and women ought to live, 
what the purpose of our liberty is.  A little over 200 years 
ago, our founding fathers meeting in this week of the year 
debated these issues, and to a man they believed, whether 
they were Christian or agnostic or deist, they all believed 
that only a virtuous people could remain free.  There is a 
lot of evidence that in the last 30 years in the United 
States, we are setting out to prove the founding fathers 
wrong.  The culture mocks virtue in many ways.  Many people 
in Washington think that virtue is an outdated concept.

<p>

I am always marveling in events around the world 
how Americans will with great pride begin to chant "we are 
number one."  I have chanted that myself watching Olympic 
events or other events, but the fact of the matter is that 
the United States has become number one in a lot of things 
that ought to bring shame rather than honor.  Whether the 
issue is half of our marriages ending in divorce or a third 
of our children being born out of wedlock or the incredible 
amounts of pornography or child abuse or drug addiction, by 
many, many measurements the United States has moved away 
from virtue, and as a result, I think, is in deep, deep 
trouble.

<p>

One of those issues related to the role of liberty 
and the role of virtue is this issue of marriage and how 
define it.  For over 5,000 years of civilization, marriage 
has been defined as the bringing together of two individuals 
from opposite sexes.  It has always been defined that way in 
civilizations that are influenced by the Judeo-Christian 
value system, and I believe that clearly in America today 
the overwhelming majority of the American people, by most 
polls 80 percent, still understand and believe marriage to 
be the bringing together of a man and a woman.  Yet, we find 
ourselves in 1996 needing to debate this basic idea.  We 
need to debate it because the cultural elite of America 
seems confused about it.  We need to debate it because a few 
unelected judges in Hawaii are in danger of redefining a 
marriage for the whole country.

<p>

I would like to spend my time discussing and 
debating other issues, and I think it is terribly 
distressful that in the latter years of this century we have 
to debate such a basic concept.  But debate it we will.  We 
believe that this issue of how marriage is defined and the 
broader issue of the nature of our liberty and how it should 
be used are the most profound issues facing the United 
States as we go into the next century.

<p>

[Videotape of Defense of Marriage Act press 
conference held June 24, 1996, follows.]

<p>

MR. HEKMAN:  We are kind of forced into this 
particular arena, not because this is a choice on our part 
that we have to glom onto this particular issue at this 
time, but because there is a decision in Hawaii, far-off 
Hawaii, of an obscure court there that has the implication 
or the possibility of impacting laws across the states, the 
other 49 states.  So we would suggest to you that without 
one vote being taken in the state of Michigan by the 
legislature, without even a court decision in the state of 
Michigan, that Michigan's laws that have existed since we 
were a state would significantly change in a very 
undemocratic method.  There is no more undemocratic method 
than such as this where an obscure court makes a decision 
significantly impacting the law in the state of Michigan in 
a particularly important area.  Few people deny that the 
definition of what marriage is is incredibly important to a 
culture.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>.  In FRC-sponsored Defense of 
Marriage briefing, Dr. Jeffrey Satinover, a psychiatrist and 
author, stated some key findings that have a great impact on 
society's view of homosexuality.  Dr. Satinover is a former 
fellow in psychiatry and child psychiatry at Yale, past 
president of the C.J. Young[?] Foundation, and holds degrees 
from MIT, the University of Texas, and Harvard University.

<p>

[Videotape of Defense of Marriage Briefing follows.]

<p>

DR. SATINOVER:  There is certainly no instance 
anywhere in history, including ancient pagan cultures, where 
the proposition has been put forward that there is a 
reasonable basis for society in anything other than the 
union of a man and a woman for the purpose of establishing 
the family.  Now the fact that that has been historically 
true, of course, speaking as a scientist, does not mean that 
it inevitably must be true.  It is conceivable that we may 
be holding onto dearly cherished opinions for 3,500 years 
which are in fact mistaken, but the burden of proof rests 
with those who would in fact alter traditions such as those.

<p>

Central to this debate is the question of 
homosexuality and what it is, and it has long been known 
among proponents of an activist agenda that it is crucially 
important to alter public opinion and public sentiment on 
the question as to the nature of homosexuality before one 
can successfully make an argument to alter the family 
structure so as to include homosexuality as a reasonable 
part of it.

<p>

Thus, quite some time ago, 15 or 20 years ago, a 
series of studies were done to examine a key point.  Let me 
read you a portion of one of these studies.  To measure the 
relationship between beliefs about the determinance of 
homosexual orientation and attitudes toward homosexuals, 745 
respondents in four different societies were queried about 
their beliefs, and the following point emerged.

<p>

Analysis indicated that subjects who believed that 
homosexuals are born that way held significantly more 
positive attitudes toward homosexuals than subjects who 
believed that homosexuals choose to be that way and/or learn 
to be that way.  There is a well-known public relations 
effect to be had from making the claim that homosexuality is 
innate, genetic, and -- the key point -- therefore 
unchangeable.

<p>

Now there have been in the last 6 or 7 years a 
series of studies.  There is a broad awareness of three 
different kinds of studies that have been put forth, largely 
by the media, as demonstrating the fact, the supposed fact, 
that homosexuality is innate, genetic, and unchangeable.  
Those studies fall into three categories.  One are brain 
changes.  The other are family or so-called twin studies, 
and the third is the search for chromosomal linkages.  The 
nature of all of these studies that have been done on 
homosexuality demonstrate a biological component to it that 
is intrinsically no different than the kind of biological 
component you would find if you examined basketball players.

<p>

Now here is how that works.  First of all, brain 
changes.  Most people presume that the brain does not 
physically change as a consequence of behavior, and that is 
an old idea.  The truth is the brain changes dramatically as 
a result of behavior.  When this was first put forth as an 
argument against brain changes, studies, the studies that 
were done, a wisecracking commentator made a remark about 
only fundamentalists believing that. 

<p>

However, the editor of <i>Nature</i>, probably the 
world's premier scientific journal, commenting on that 
research himself, said plainly the neural correlates of 
genetically determined gender are plastic structures in the 
hypothalamus and could allow the consequences of sexual 
arousal to be made permanent.

<p>

A clear example of how this happens:  in 
individuals who become blind as adults and then learned 
Braille, the part of the brain governing the right index 
finger became progressively enlarged.  What we do with our 
lives not only changes our character and our personality, it 
will also have an effect in the brain.

<p>

Second, twin studies.  The most widely touted set 
of studies supposedly show that among identical twins there 
is an increased incidence of either both being homosexual or 
both being heterosexual such that it points to a genetic 
determination of homosexuality.  Now, first, I am going to 
read you two paragraphs from the very study that is cited as 
evidence.

<p>

The opening paragraphs:  these studies were 
designed to detect heritable variation, and if it was 
present, to counter the prevalent belief that sexual 
orientation is largely the product of family interactions 
and the social environment.  Now you will notice that this 
is a scientific study being done for a political purpose, 
which of course is not right to begin with.

<p>

Nonetheless, this is what the authors concluded:  
although male and female homosexuality appear to be at least 
somewhat heritable, environment must also be of considerable 
importance in their origins.  Now that paragraph from their 
study is never quoted in public.  In fact, other 
commentators, other scientific commentators, have said very 
clearly -- for example, two authors from Harvard and the <i>MIT 
Technology Review</i>; both are geneticists; one is the head of 
the largest genetics faculty in the country.

<p>

While the authors -- referring to the same study -- while 
the authors interpreted their findings as evidence 
for a genetic basis for homosexuality, we think that the 
data, in fact, provide strong evidence for the influence of 
the environment.  Now there are science writers currently 
going around saying that there is absolutely no argument on 
the point that homosexuality is genetic, and that is flatly 
wrong.  The majority of well-informed behavioral geneticists 
understand that the current research only shows a heritable 
influence, which is not terribly specific, and that most of 
the research actually demonstrates the opposite of what is 
being claimed.

<p>

Now heritable influence is something that I will 
explain very briefly, but before I do, let me also quote you 
from the author of the most widely cited study on 
chromosomal leukogens[?].  This is the study about which 
major news weeklies headed across their cover "Gay Gene," 
and you may have seen another one on a related topic about 
adultery, "Adultery, In Our Genes?"

<p>

When pressed by scientists to explain the 
discrepancy between the way his findings were being reported 
and what his findings actually demonstrated, this author 
said the following:  the relationships among genes and 
environment probably have a somewhat different effect on 
someone in Salt Lake City than if that person were growing 
up in New York City, i.e. liberal Manhattan, conservative 
Utah, difference in outcome as to whether an individual is 
or is not going to be homosexual.  The bottom line of that 
statement is a clear acknowledgment that the social 
environment has a dramatic effect on the incidence of 
homosexuality.  What does it mean for something to have 
genetic influence or genetic linkage or genetic association 
or heritable influence?  It does not mean what most people 
think it means.  Most people do not understand enough about 
behavioral genetics to realize that that phrase means almost 
nothing, and a good behavioral geneticist will tell you that 
heritable variation is a meaningless finding.

<p>

Here is what it means.  If you look at a group of 
basketball players, you will find, first of all, that their 
brains are different than the brains of non-basketball 
players, because those areas of the brain responsible for 
repeated basketball playing will have grown larger.

<p>

Point number two.  If you look at family studies, 
you will see that if one identical twin is a basketball 
player, even if the second twin is raised in another family, 
the second twin is also likely to be a basketball player, 
not because there is a gene for basketball playing, but for 
the simple reason that height and athleticism are factors 
which are inherited and which will make basketball playing 
more likely.  Therefore, if the one is, the other is.  The 
principle here is that heritable variation points only 
toward intermediate traits which themselves need not have 
anything to do with the subject you are studying.  So for 
example, it is quite possible that the intermediate trait, 
which predisposes to homosexuality or intermediate traits, 
would include such things as sensitivity, shyness, a 
tendency to be more interested in the world of the mind.  I 
would not be surprised, in fact, if intelligence itself, to 
the extent that it has a heritable component, correlates in 
the same way with homosexuality.

<p>

I cannot give you evidence to prove that, because 
the political process has prevented the kind of reasonable 
scientific studies that should be done on this subject, 
especially considering how many people struggle with it.

<p>

Change.  There were about 50 years of outcome 
studies on treatment of homosexuality using a variety of 
modalities.  Some of those methods, we have come to believe, 
are inappropriate and should not be used, but the majority 
of methods are simply psychotherapeutic.  They involve 
nothing more than talking and exploring the underlying 
sufferings that help give rise to homosexuality in 
vulnerable individuals.

<p>

Here is an example, just one study, with long-term 
follow-up.  Of 49 patients who were able by a previous 
therapy to control their homosexuality, 63 percent were 
contacted for follow-up.  The average period since the end 
of treatment was 4 years.  Nineteen -- 61 percent -- have 
remained exclusively heterosexual.  There are more details 
of this.

<p>

If you look at outcome studies up until the 
American Psychiatric Association basically killed off the 
field by removing homosexuality from the DSM as a diagnosis, 
you find a consistent result of anywhere from 25 to 75 
percent success rate, with an average rate of success of 
over 50 percent.

<p>

Now I will close by making the following 
observation.  If you look at the heavily funded program 
aimed at changing high risk sexual behavior among at-risk 
homosexual males, you find a long-term success rate just in 
changing the dangerous behaviors which is actually somewhat 
worse than the results for changing sexual orientation 
altogether.  Given that epidemiologists now acknowledge from 
multiple studies around the country that among 20-year-old 
men who identify themselves as gay, 30 percent will either 
be HIV-positive or dead of AIDS by the time they are 30, 
even if a success rate of 10 percent were available, it is 
in my view morally reprehensible that we are not making a 
determined effort to do everything possible to help people 
leave homosexuality who wish to.

MR. MANSFIELD:  Public opinion drives public 
policy, whether it is in Washington, D.C., or in Boise, 
Idaho, or New Jersey.  It does not matter where you are at.  
Public opinion drives public policy.

<p>

In fact, the New Jersey ACLU just this past week 
stated it is a shame that we have some radical heterosexuals 
who are activists who want to create special rights for 
straight people.  We felt in Idaho that if moms and dads who 
attend soccer practices, who put their babies to sleep, who 
wake up every morning and take care of things, that if they 
are radical extremists, then somebody somewhere is out of 
line.

<p>

Now ladies and gentlemen, supporting the 
prohibition of same sex marriage, it is not unkind and it is 
not uncompassionate.  From the heartland of Idaho, it just 
makes sense.

MS. HAMRICK:  We are back with more <i>Straight Talk 
from the Family Research Council</i>, where we are presenting 
the recent Defense of Marriage Briefing on Capitol Hill.  
Dr. Hadley Arkes, professor of jurisprudence at American 
institutions at Amherst College and contributing editor to 
major national publications, takes a look at what would 
happen if we changed the definition of marriage in the 
context of the law.

<p>

[Videotape of Defense of Marriage Briefing, 
broadcast July 2, 1996, follows.]

<p>

MR. ARKES:  I want to take a moment to remind the 
press and the public about what it is that created a certain 
urgency for the Defense of Marriage Act.  It was not merely 
the litigation percolating in Hawaii, because that had been 
going on for along time.  Matters had to move along quickly 
because there was an awareness of <i>Romer versus Evans</i>, the 
Colorado case then pending before the Supreme Court.  When I 
testified on May 15, we were expecting that case any day, 
and it turned out it was decided on May 20.  It was quite as 
bad as many of us anticipated it would be.

<p>

The court in that case struck down a 
constitutional amendment in Colorado that refused to treat 
gays and lesbians as a protected or favored class.  We will 
hear, of course, many different accounts of that case, but 
in my own reading, that case will be read by many activists 
among the judges to produce this lesson, that a state may 
not incorporate anywhere in its laws or public policy an 
adverse judgment on homosexuality, and it may not refuse to 
accord to homosexuality the same standing or legitimacy that 
attaches to that sexuality imprinted in our natures.

<p>

With this move, the court may have armed federal 
judges to tie up any legislation in a state that refused to 
honor homosexual marriages.  After all, the argument could 
run that the state refuses to credit this marriage only 
because of the gender or the sexual orientation of the 
couple.  Would this not be then on its face but another 
discrimination directed at gays and lesbians?

<p>

When we look at <i>Romer versus Evans</i> and how that is 
complicating the situation, we do not have to be confined to 
speculation.  We simply follow the precise warning cast up 
by Justice Scalia in his dissenting opinion.  As Scalia 
pointed out, the Association of American Law Schools now 
require all of their members to extract this pledge from law 
firms that are interviewing candidates that the employer 
would be willing hire homosexuals.

<p>

At the same time, the Supreme Court has now 
declared in the <i>Romer</i> case that the people who hold to the 
traditional Jewish and Christian teaching on sexuality are 
fueled by an irrational animus.  Now as far as I know, no 
moral court has managed yet to refute the traditional Jewish 
and Christian teaching on this ancient problem, and yet the 
court has now pronounced that teaching to be vacuous, to be 
connected to no plausible or defensible purpose.

<p>

As Scalia has observed, the court now declares 
serious Christians and Jews to be nothing less than bigots.  
So as we put these strands together, they start pointing in 
this direction.  Is there not an incentive now for law firms 
to gauge whether senior partners or young associates harbor 
views that may put the firm at odds with the regulations 
bearing on the law schools.  While affecting no prejudice, 
mind you, toward people who are serious about their 
religion, the law firms may nevertheless screen out people 
who acknowledge their seriousness as Christians and Jews.

<p>

And the incentives will not emanate simply from 
the conventions of the law schools.  After all, if the 
Supreme Court itself has now declared that a moral objection 
to homosexuality is indefensible, irrational, the 
distillation of an unreasoned prejudice or animus, does the 
court not in fact install the predicate for grievances and 
litigation?

<p>

If the young gay associate is denied standing as a 
partner, could it not be claimed now that the climate in the 
firm was poisoned from the outset or set in a discriminatory 
cast by the presence of senior partners who bore moral 
reservations about homosexuality, and what could be said 
about the law firms could be said even more forcefully about 
the colleges and the universities, and given the litigious 
experience these days in the academy, we can virtually count 
on the fact that grievances will be filed.

<p>

What if a member of an academic department has 
simply done what I have done, given testimony in public or 
published an article staking out a position, reaching a 
moral judgment on some of these questions, on gay marriage?  
Might that supply a prima facic[?] route for a grievance 
later?  Might it not be argued -- in fact, won't it be 
argued that the situation was at least biased or tilted from 
the very outset by the presence of that member of the 
faculty?

<p>

Can we not then expect certain kinds of pressures 
to suggest that his presence during the process of tenure 
would be inappropriate?  Perhaps his presence during the 
hiring process would be inappropriate.  In fact, being 
prudent about these matters, it might be better simply to 
forestall the problem at the root by failing to hire people 
of this kind who generate problems later.  Some of what you 
have here in <i>Romer versus Evans</i> is a rather clean device for 
purging from the professions and the universities those 
people who are overly religious, overly serious about the 
traditional teachings of Judaism and Christianity.  It is a 
very powerful weapon.

<p>

[Videotape of Defense of Marriage Act press 
conference held June 24, 1996, follows.]

<p>

MR. SCIANNA:  When Missouri found itself in the 
unconscionable position of having to defend marriage in 
response to the situation in Hawaii, the legislators began 
to hear such things as this legislation is unnecessary, or 
come on, guys; we do not need this shameful hate-mongering 
in our state, and as the debate began to rise, the same 
issue began to come up time and again, and we also began to 
hear things like this is not a gay issue, this is not a 
homosexual issue, but this issue is being brought to the 
forefront by this radical right.

<p>

I am here to submit to you today that those two 
components come straight out of the pages or the playbook, 
if you will, from the same sex marriage proponents.  In its 
manual <i>To Have and To Hold</i>, the National Gay and Lesbian 
Task Force sets forth their legislative agenda, and it reads 
rather simply:  stall the bill, shepherd it into less 
hostile committees, define the bill to the press and 
politicians in terms of benefits or strategy, and they go on 
to say to urge politicians to say the bill is unnecessary or 
that we do not need this shameful hate-mongering in our 
state.

<p>

In addition to that, the other side of the 
argument was that this issue was not being brought up by the 
homosexuals.  In fact, several testified that they were not 
really ready for same-sex marriage, that they had not really 
had a chance to think this out.  In its manual Lambda puts 
forth in the marriage project, it calls the case in Hawaii 
and several other cases, its case.  They go on to say that 
for the last 5 years they have been working on these cases, 
forum shopping for judges, working with law students, 
lawyers, and people across the states to bring this back and 
make it a state by state issue.

<p>

So as we began to look at that in Missouri -- it 
is the old don't tell me show me state -- we began to look 
more and more at some of the things that were occurring 
across the United States, and we were not alone, and as 
people began to step up to podium you began to hear things 
like history proves that no society which has ever redefined 
sexual morality outside of one man one woman marriage has 
ever survived, and we began to look around us and to see 
things in our own culture that led us to believe that the 
culture in Missouri and perhaps the culture in America would 
not fare any better than any prior civilization's.

<p>

So as a result, the Missouri General Assembly 
overwhelmingly passed language in defense of marriage.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We will now hear from Robert 
Knight, FRC's Director of Cultural Studies.  Bob examines 
the legal, social, and cultural ramifications of same sex 
marriage on our society.

<p>

[Videotape of Defense of Marriage Briefing, 
broadcast July 2, 1996, follows.]

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Most Americans believe in the 
philosophy of live and let live.  I do not think there is 
any widespread sentiment for persecuting homosexuals in this 
country.  As a matter of fact, they have achieved an 
enormous deal of tolerance.  But what they are trying to do 
now is go beyond that tolerance and to harness the power of 
the law and of corporations increasingly to force 
affirmation of homosexuality on those who disagree with the 
idea that it is healthy and normal and moral.

<p>

If homosexual marriage is legalized -- and I use 
marriage in quotes, because it is a non sequiter; there is 
no such thing as homosexual marriage, marriage being the 
union of a man and a woman -- this would create a situation 
where people who are of devout Christian, Jewish, or Muslim 
beliefs, or if they are atheists who just happen to think 
that marriage ought to be between a man and a woman, find 
themselves outside the law.

<p>

We will have the prospect of business people being 
forced to subsidize homosexual relationships or face legal 
sanction.  We will face the prospect of children being 
taught that homosexuality is normal in school, because how 
could they be taught otherwise if the state sets aside 
status and privileges that make homosexual relationships on 
a par with marriage?  The reason marriage has special 
benefits built in at the legal, cultural, and social levels 
is because it is indispensable to the survival of 
civilization.  No other institution does for civilization 
what marriage does.

<p>

While homosexuals say they only want tolerance, 
they are being dishonest, I believe, about that.  They are 
quite intolerant with anyone who disagrees with them, and if 
you do not think that is true, ask the Boy Scouts of 
America.  They are under legal attack in states where the 
gay rights laws are already on the books, and the Scouts are 
basically being told you abandon the moral traditions that 
you have had for 80 years in raising boys to be men, and you 
have place homosexuals over young boys on camping trips, or 
we will see that you face legal ruin.  We will litigate and 
litigate until you cry uncle.

<p>

Mind you, the Scouts are a private organization, 
and that parents in a free country ought to be able to 
entrust their children to an organization that reflects 
their most deeply held beliefs.  One would think in a free 
country they could do that, but gay activists do not think 
so.  They want to force their agenda right into the Boy 
Scout troops.  That is tyranny.  That is not tolerance.

<p>

Here is an example of where we are headed if the 
gay rights movement is not turned back.  In Hamilton, 
Ontario -- and I got this out of an article by David Fromm 
in a Canadian magazine -- in Hamilton, Ontario, gay 
activists came to the mayor, and they said, look, we want 
you to issue a proclamation to celebrate Gay Pride Week.  
Now Hamilton is a blue collar Catholic town, and the mayor 
has no ax to grind with gays, but he said, look, I don't 
think this would sit well with most of my constituents, and 
I just don't want to do it.

<p>

He was hauled before a Human Rights Commission 
under the gay rights law, and he was fined personally 
$5,000, and the charge was that he was sowing hatred and was 
gay-bashing, merely for not celebrating what most of the 
people in Hamilton considered something immoral.  That is 
where we are headed with gay rights.  That is the real 
agenda.  You celebrate it, you affirm it, or we will bring 
legal sanctions against you.

<p>

Homosexuality has been discouraged in all cultures 
in all eras, because it is destructive.  The truth should 
finally be told about it, but what you read in the media is 
not what the gay lifestyle is all about.  I was in the media 
for 15 years as a reporter and editor, 7 of them at the Los 
Angeles Times, and I can tell you that in those news rooms 
all across America, there is a reluctance to deal with the 
behavior of homosexuality, with scientific studies that 
contradict the major claims of gay activists, particularly 
in the genetic area, and to propagate certain myths that 
move the agenda along.

<p>

In a brief time, I would like to go through some 
of those myths.  The 10 percent myth, that 10 percent of the 
population is homosexual.  That stems from the discredited 
Kinsey studies of the 1940s.  It has not been replicated, 
and there are 30 reliable studies from around the globe 
showing that it is under 3 percent and more probably under 2 
or 1 percent, and yet you still see it used.

<p>

The genetic studies.  Dr. Satinover addressed 
them.  Suffice it to say you can drive a truck through these 
studies.  The twin studies, in particular, for identical 
twins show that if half of them are not gay, then how can it 
possibly be genetic.  If you know what identical twins are, 
it is the exact same genetic material.  These studies, if 
anything, undercut the claim that there is a genetic 
component.

<p>

Gay teen suicide, and you will probably hear more 
about this later from Pete LaBarbara[?], there is this claim 
that one in three teen suicides is gay.  That came out of a 
single report in 1989 by a gay activist named Paul 
Gibson[?].  His report was repudiated by Louis Sullivan, the 
Secretary of Health and Human Services, and it has been 
criticized deeply by experts in the field like David 
Schaeffer[?] of Columbia University, and yet you see it used 
constantly to justify programs in public schools.

<p>

Psychological studies.  In the 1950s, a UCLA 
psychologist named Evelyn Hooker[?] gathered 30 homosexual 
men and 30 heterosexual men and put them through some 
psychological tests.  She was trying to prove -- and she 
told interviewers later -- trying to prove that gays were no 
different from non-gays.  In two of the three tests, the 
gays were picked right out by the independent judge.  They 
sexualized everything in the tests.

<p>

Yet, that is never revealed in the media.  The 
media keeps saying, well, these studies of Evelyn Hooker 
show that gays are no different; they are normal.  That 
study was the major piece of evidence cited in 1973 when the 
American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from 
its list of disorders.  This is bad science, and it has been 
used in a very political way.

<p>

Finally, gay parenting studies.  We hear them all 
the time in the quest for expanded adoption opportunities 
for gays.  If you look at all of these studies, they have 
tiny sample sizes, 8 or 9 people.  Most of the people know 
each other in the other study groups.  The people were 
recruited by gay activist publications, and the studies are 
done by lesbian activists.

<p>

But even with all of that, if you add up the 
children in all these studies, the weight of evidence shows 
that the children are four times as likely to either have a 
homosexual orientation later in life or to experiment with 
homosexuality.  Doesn't that make sense?  Children model 
their behavior after their parents.  Why would we be 
surprised that kids in gay households might try homosexual 
sex?  After all, if mom and mom are doing it, or dad and 
dad, why not the kids?  This is a threat to children.  It is 
a way to lead them into a destructive behavior that will 
diminish their lives.

<p>

The language of gay rights is tolerance.  We just 
keep hearing that word.  We hear diversity also misused.  
But the aim is raw power, to basically criminalize dissent 
on this issue.  If you are identified as an opponent of gay 
rights, you are going to have a rough time.  That is across 
the board in this country now, and it has to stop.  The 
truth should be told about homosexuality, and that is that 
it is changeable; it does not lead to a happy life; there is 
a way out; and more people should know about it.

MS. DEALY:  Society has long recognized that men 
and women are different.  They bring different strengths, 
different perspectives, different ideas, and different 
insights into relationships, and when they are combined as a 
unit, there has the strongest building block for all 
society, but especially for the effects that that has and 
what that brings to children, and even in California, where 
anything goes and there is rare consensus on public policy 
issues, there is overwhelming support for traditional 
marriage.

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>.  We now bring you the impact 
legalizing same sex unions would have on your children at 
school.  Linda Page, a former school principal, education 
consultant and writer, presents what she has already seen 
take place due to homosexual activism and her prediction on 
what that would look like nationally.

<p>

[Videotape of Defense of Marriage Briefing 
broadcast July 2, 1996, follows.]

<p>

MS. PAGE:  As we look at what the education scene 
is about, without being denigrating or without in any way 
diminishing the role of dedicated caring teachers, we see 
that we have folks that jump on bandwagons right and left.  
We see a culture in education that is driven by whatever the 
latest thing is.  That comes from the fact that teachers are 
the kind of people who want to make a difference with 
students.  They go into education because they want to 
prepare them to have better lives.  So they are always 
looking for better ways of doing things, and they are always 
looking for more effective things that will work.

<p>

Why do we have these people who find themselves in 
situations that really actually bring harm to students?  We 
have state and federal mandates that educators are bound to 
fulfill.  We have local mandates that educators are bound to 
fulfill.  Take, for example, the Rainbow Curriculum in New 
York City a few years ago.  That caused a major public 
outcry, because we had activists there who wanted to make 
certain that every child had positive self-esteem regardless 
of the kind of family they came from.  That relates very, 
very specifically to same sex marriage.

<p>

I brought a copy of one of the books that I would 
like to share a few pages with you from.  This book is 
called "Heather Has Two Mommies," and this is the kind of 
thing as we move toward a bandwagon which would ensue if we 
have federal mandates or state mandates that would result 
from same sex marriage being legalized and having the force 
of law behind it.  This is the kind of thing that we could 
expect in our primary children's classrooms.

<p>

This is Heather.  She lives in a little house with 
a big apple tree in the front yard and lots of tall grass in 
the back yard.  Heather's favorite number is two.  She has 
two arms, two legs, two eyes, two ears, two hands, and two 
feet.  Heather has two pets, a ginger colored cat named 
Ginger Snap and a big black dog named Midnight.

<p>

Heather also has two mommies, Mama Jane and Mama 
Kate.  A long, long time ago before Heather was born, Mama 
Jane and Mama Kate were very good friends, only they weren't 
mommies then; they were just Jane and Kate.  Kate lived on 
one side of town with Midnight, and Jane lived on the other 
side of town with Ginger Snap.

<p>

After they were friends for a long, long time, 
Kate and Jane realized that they were very much in love with 
each other.  They decided they wanted to live together and 
be a family together.  So Jane and Kate and Midnight and 
Ginger Snap all moved into the little house with the big 
apple tree in the front yard and the tall grass in the back 
yard, and they were all very happy, except for one thing.

<p>

Kate and Jane wanted to have a baby.

<p>

I am not going to finish reading this, but this is 
the kind of book that we could expect in our classrooms for 
primary readers if we have same sex marriage legalized.  
What we can expect overall if this situation takes place is 
a complete overhaul of curricula in general, staff 
development programs, teacher training programs, textbooks.  
We can expect an erosion of parental rights.

<p>

What we will see are kids who have already been 
instilled with values clarifications notions, which says 
that all values are equal, which is a totally ludicrous 
thought when we consider the horrific Saudi Arabian bombing 
last week.  All values are not equal, but our kids will be 
indoctrinated and immersed in a culture and in rhetoric and 
in education curricula which completely changes their view 
of themselves and of the world, and it is absolutely 
essential that we protect our kids who are very, very tender 
and very pliable from this danger.

MR. CLARK:  Same sex marriage is now prohibited in 
the state of Illinois.  It has been signed by the governor.  
The majority vote in the House was 83 in favor of this bill 
prohibiting same sex marriage and 12 against.  In the 
Illinois Senate, 43 to prohibit same sex marriage, and 7 
against.

<p>

Any time we have gotten into debates about welfare 
reform, criminal justice, inevitably these kinds of issues 
look back to what are the causes of some of the problems, 
and it is broken families time and time again.  So the kinds 
of issues that had sensitized our general assembly had 
already been talked about.  Intact families are the best 
place for kids, and to think that all of a sudden we are 
going to destroy this concept of marriage that has been the 
basis of our societal stability for hundreds, probably 
thousands, of years, was outrageous.

<p>

MR. OSTRANDER:  The fact is that each of us and 
each of us in the context of our families live in a cultural 
ecosystem, and this ecosystem, I think, is more fragile than 
we care to note.  The fact is several years ago William 
Bennett did shed some light on it in his index of leading 
cultural indicators, and with that report, what we saw was a 
kind of toxicity in our culture.  What I am referencing is 
the rate of divorce.  I am referencing promiscuity of all 
kinds.  I am referencing spousal abuse, child abuse, 
substance abuse, illegitimacy, poverty, any number of 
things, all of which should be looked at as a toxicity to 
the health and well-being of our families.

<p>

When an ecosystem is threatened to this degree, 
the environmentalist is not content with a redefinition of 
the ecosystem or a redefinition of what we use to measure 
the health of that ecosystem.

<p>

We must not at this time redefine marriage and 
redefine family.  We must, instead, put our efforts to 
strengthening the family, the tried and true, the 
traditional, that which has for generations given us layer 
of leadership after leadership that could move freely in the 
realms of government, in the realms of business, in the 
realms of the spiritual, in all realms.

<p>

We simply cannot allow a small handful of judges 
whose ideas about the family are different, far different, 
from the average American's to dictate to the rest of 
America what the American family is and what it should be 
and what it will be for generations to come.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i>, we continue the presentation of 
our recent FRC-sponsored Defense of Marriage Briefing, which
took place in the Capitol Building before a distinguished
Hill audience.

<p>

This is especially timely because of the House's 
critical vote in which the Defense of Marriage Act passed by 
a vote of 342 to 67.  Now the battle moves to the Senate.
To understand the issues at play, we will show some experts 
who present crucial information regarding the impact 
legalizing same-sex marriage would have on children, their 
development, school curriculum, adoption law, and our places 
of worship.

<p>

You will be introduced to a former homosexual who 
now devotes his life and his ministry to helping those who 
would like to escape the homosexual lifestyle, and we'll 
hear from leaders of grass-roots organizations talking about 
the impact changing marriage would have on the states.

<p>

Tonight's show promises to be an informative one, 
full of exclusive information and facts that the media does 
not usually divulge.

<p>

We will begin with Anthony Falzarano, executive 
director of Transformation Christian Ministry.  Anthony, a 
former homosexual, truly understands the destructiveness the 
lifestyle brings into a person's life.  Let's hear what he 
had to say about his own experience and views on same-sex 
marriage.

<p>

[Segment from Defense of Marriage Briefing, 
Capitol Hill, July 2, 1996 follows:]

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  My name is Anthony Falzarano.  I 
am the executive director of Transformation Ex-Gay Christian 
Ministries in Washington, D.C.  We are the Washington, D.C., 
affiliate of Exodus International, which is the largest ex-gay 
network in the world.  We have over 120 ministries 
worldwide, and we offer hope to the repentant homosexual 
community.

<p>

We are one of four ex-gay networks in the world, 
and currently there are over 200 ministries to help 
homosexuals who desire to leave the gay lifestyle behind.

<p>

The United States of America has taken a dangerous 
moral nosedive in the last 35 years, and it is time to say 
enough is enough to the enemies of this country that have 
been allowed to infiltrate the halls of Congress with their 
voices of destruction.

<p>

The politically motivated homosexual community in 
this country has stepped over the line.  This movement is 
extremely well funded and well connected.  It has been 
working for the last 30 years like an army of termites, 
secretly eating away the floorboards of moral integrity in 
this country.  It is time to expose the agenda of these gay 
political organizations.

<p>

The gay community shocked us in the 1970s by 
coming out of the closet.  They gained our sympathy in the 
1980s with the horrible pandemic called AIDS.  And they are 
now trying, in the 1990s, to force our acceptance of this 
lifestyle using the legal systems of this country.

<p>

I speak to you today not as an observer of the 
homosexual community but as one of them.  I am a former 
homosexual.  I lived that lifestyle from the time I was 17 
until the time I was 26.  I entered the gay lifestyle 
thinking that there really wasn't any choice for me.

<p>

What I didn't realize is that although I didn't 
choose to be homosexual, I did not have to be gay; that I 
had a choice; that I could change my orientation from gay to 
straight, and that is what Exodus did for me nine years ago. 
I am now happily married and I have two children, and only 
by the grace of God, after having over 400 sexual partners, 
I am HIV negative.

<p>

My healing process was a long and difficult one.
However, change is possible.  The four national ex-gay 
networks are currently ministering to over 10,000 former 
homosexuals, and our phones are literally ringing off the 
hooks.  We are growing in leaps and bounds.

<p>

Many of us are sick and tired of a lifestyle that 
initially seems very freeing but eventually puts us in all 
kinds of bondage and eventually kills us.  I have lost over 
35 of my friends and acquaintances to the disease of AIDS, 
and I don't want to see one more person contract this deadly 
disease.

<p>

The organized gay community in this country is 
telling us that AIDS is no longer a gay disease, and 
although it is spreading into the heterosexual population in 
this country very quickly, the facts are, according to the 
Centers for Disease Control, that 61 percent of people that 
have AIDS are homosexual men.

<p>

America needs to start helping homosexuals recover 
from sexual brokenness.  Eighty percent of the people that 
come to Transformation have been sexually molested and/or 
raped as children.  Homosexuals are victims.  Homosexuals in 
most instances do not bond with their same-sex parent, and 
we need to start helping homosexuals.  We must love the 
homosexual and hate the sin that they are involved in.

<p>

Putting a stamp of approval on this lifestyle by 
legally recognizing it and even calling it marriage is not 
really helping homosexuals; it is perpetuating a false myth 
of happiness.  Many people believe that if I can marry, then 
all of my problems concerning homosexuality will be over.
That is a myth.

<p>

QUESTION: I have a question for Mr. Falzarano.
What brought about your personal transformation, if you 
don't mind going into that, and a little bit more about the 
transformational ministries and what they do to help the 
homosexual transform?  I am curious about that.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  My past life is very public, so I 
don't mind sharing any detail of it.

<p>

Basically, one of the strong motivations, 
obviously, was my conversion to Christianity.  I began to 
look at the Holy Scriptures and see that Jesus says, if you 
love me, you will refrain from all sexual immorality, and, 
obviously, I was highly promiscuous.  Not all homosexuals 
are, but there were a large amount of my friends that were.

<p>

So I began to look at my personal life and 
realized that I had to clean up my act.  And then I got 
married 12 years ago, thinking that that would cure my 
homosexuality, because there was not help like there is 
today and I had no one to go to, so I thought, well, I would 
do the right thing and get married, and that would surely 
cure my homosexuality.

<p>

One third of the people we help at Transformation 
are married men and women, so we know that marriage does not 
cure homosexuality.  I needed to look within myself, and 
that is what Exodus helped me look at.  I was a victim of 
sexual abuse as a child; I was sexually molested five times 
as a child.

<p>

I had a physically present father but a 
psychologically absent father.  He was there every night.
My parents were married for 50 years.  On the surface it 
looked like a great marriage, and it was a decent marriage, 
but my father was psychologically unavailable to me.  Those 
were some of my root causes.

<p>

So when I came to Exodus, I had to deal with a lot 
of those issues, a lot of anger inside, especially directed 
to my perpetrators.  Forgiveness -- I had to look at my 
father and my mother, look at the reality that with seven 
children they had a full plate and that he did probably the 
best that he was able to do.  So a lot of forgiveness in 
that area.

<p>

I had to stop my physical acting out.  I was 
addicted to masturbation and pornography.  Many homosexuals 
are, male homosexuals.  I had to put aside all of my 
addiction and get some therapy for that to understand why I 
was falling into that kind of behavior.

<p>

And as I began to lay all of that aside in my life 
and deal with those issues, I began to have proper sexual 
attraction to my wife.  I can say now that we have quite a 
successful marriage after 12 years.

<p>

[Segment from Defense of Marriage Press 
Conference, National Press Club, June 24, 1995, follows:]

<p>

MR. PAULTON: Why are South Dakotans so decisive 
about this issue?  First, they understand that, throughout 
the course of history, marriage has been the foundation of 
society.  It uniquely brings the sexes together to form the 
foundation, the framework for the family.

<p>

In South Dakota we believe that our most precious 
resource is the family.  As Joe mentioned, with all of the 
dysfunctions, the social dysfunctions that we see around us, 
this is no time to toy with the very building block of the 
family.

<p>

Secondly, this is also a state's rights issue.  As 
has been said very well here, this is a decision that should 
be left to the people of each individual state.  The people 
of South Dakota have spoken clearly on this issue, and their 
elected officials have spoken clearly.  That decision should 
rest with each individual state, not with a few people in a 
far-away Hawaii court.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. In the FRC-sponsored Defense 
of Marriage Briefing, Dr. Brenda Destro focused on the 
potential ramifications that same-sex marriage would have 
upon teen sexuality.  Dr. Destro, who served as a social 
work consultant for the U.S. Department of Health and 
Services, shares her experience regarding child sexual 
identity development and the same-sex debate.

<p>

[Segment from Defense of Marriage Briefing of 
July 2, 1996, continues:]

<p>

DR. DESTRO:  Before I talk about the relationship 
between sex education and homosexuality, I want to just give 
you a little background on sex education, which was 
originally a product of the public health community as a 
method of primary prevention or education to help sexually 
active teens prevent pregnancy, usually using medical 
technology.

<p>

Even though these programs and the evaluation 
studies that have overseen them for the past probably 20 
years have continually shown that sex education has little 
or no impact on teenage pregnancy, it has continued to 
expand in both its approach and its audience and is now 
widely available in public and private schools throughout 
the United States.

<p>

So the sex education programs that many, many, 
many, many teenagers are participating in now happen to be 
the primary mechanism with which most teens learn about 
sexuality, learn about pregnancy, very little about 
marriage, and now homosexuality.

<p>

Those political people who are advancing a 
homosexual rights and the same-sex relationship rights 
agenda actually have very little regard for the 
developmental needs of the preteens and teenagers in our 
society, and it is very evident in these widespread sex 
education curricula which are offered to 10- all the way 
through 18-year-olds in most of the public schools 
throughout our country.  The subject of homosexuality, along 
with other topics, is included in most sex education 
curricula, more as a politically correct thing to do and not 
necessarily balanced with the cognitive, emotional, social, 
and moral needs of the children who participate, and, I 
believe, having harmful results.

<p>

As homosexuality and same-sex relationships are 
further sanctioned, these topics will be given even greater 
recognition and higher profile in sex education curricula, 
and I believe this will result in even more harm.

<p>

I am going to talk about maybe the work of the 
developmental theorists, Pieget(?), Erikson, Kohlberg(?), 
all people whose work is probably the basis of most of what 
is learned in the public education system.  But they believe 
that there are distinct differences in personality and the 
way we think and the way we socialize and even in our 
morality, and that is true among children and even adults of 
different ages.

<p>

The pattern by which each of us goes through these 
stages is an individual and interrelated and interdependent, 
basically a very complex process.  But for most of us, we 
acquire these skills, especially socialization, in a fairly 
sequential manner, and we move from one stage to the next if 
we are able to complete the tasks that are required from the 
previous stage.  If we don't complete those tasks or there 
are certain skills that are absent, it makes learning new 
behaviors or more mature behaviors a little bit harder.

<p>

Before I discuss the issue of homosexuality and 
sex education, let me give you an example of another, 
actually, a less controversial topic in sex education that 
is not consistent, let's say, with the cognitive development 
or the learning needs of preteens and teens, and that is the 
notion of including a decision-making model.

<p>

Many sex education curricula teach decision-making 
to children -- again, this 10- to 18-year-old age -- so that 
they make appropriate decisions regarding their sexual 
behavior.  They learn a model that helps them to identify a 
problem, develop a set of options to solve that problem, 
assess those options, and then eventually make a decision or 
pick one of the options that they consider to be the best.

<p>

Now, my first reaction when I looked at these 
programs -- and, I am sure, any parent's first reaction -- 
is, well, this sounds like a good thing.  You know, getting 
children to make responsible choices sounds like a great 
thing.

<p>

But when you balance that against the actual 
characteristics of these same children, you find that many 
of them are not able to think ahead, they are not able to 
assess risk, and they don't really fully consider the 
feelings of others.  Instead, as is characteristic of most 
preteens and teenagers, they are self-centered, they are 
idealistic, they are very present-oriented and impulsive.  
And the result is that these children may be able to 
memorize a decision-making model, but they are not likely to 
use it.

<p>

But the problem runs a little bit deeper than just 
using or not using this particular model.  It is a problem 
of adults expecting preteens and teenagers to act like 
adults when they should be acting like teenagers.  And as 
much as none of us like a lot of the behavior of teens, they 
are actually supposed to be self-centered, they are supposed 
to be idealistic, and they are supposed to be very grounded 
in the present.  And these characteristics actually provide 
a kind of protection for them in the process of 
experimenting with new ideas and new behaviors.

<p>

The role of parents and adults or teachers, then, 
is to provide a structure that allows teens to do this 
experimentation, to experiment, but making it consistent 
with their capabilities, but also be available to help them 
learn from this experience.

<p>

What is taught in sex education really asks the 
child or the preteenager or teenager to skip an important 
stage of development, to make critical decisions without the 
skills and guidance that are needed.  This expectation can 
and does lure many preteens and teens into high-risk 
situations that are really beyond their current 
capabilities.  Some of those risks can include pregnancy and 
now even AIDS.

<p>

Now let's turn to the topic to the homosexuality, 
which is usually addressed in a very similar manner, just 
presented, put forth out there to the same age group of 
children.  The homosexuality and, to a lesser degree now, 
same-sex relationships are actually commonly found in sex 
education curricula as a result of this growing debate about 
homosexuality.

<p>

But as that is being taught, these preteens and 
teens are entering a phase in their psychosocial development 
where it is very characteristic for these young girls to 
have a very close girlfriend or these boys to have a very 
close boyfriend.  And that is very normal.  That again is a 
stage.  That is an important developmental stage, which I 
will explain in a minute is a building block in terms of 
learning emotional intimacy and closeness.  But in these 
curriculums there is absolutely no distinction made between 
these two, I will say, events -- homosexuality and this 
normal stage of development.

<p>

All of us as children learn emotional intimacy and 
closeness starting in the family, and as we bond with 
mothers and fathers and siblings, et cetera, but as we reach 
puberty, we go outside the family and we develop these 
bonds, first with friends of our own sex; then we sort of 
move into sort of group situations with the same sex and 
then the opposite sex; and eventually, we develop a healthy 
level of intimacy that becomes an important element in 
developing romantic relationships and sexual relationships 
in marriage.

<p>

Now, if they skip a stage or experience a crisis 
in a stage, the negative aspects of that stage will 
predominate, making it difficult for them to handle the 
tasks of the next stage.

<p>

So now, what happens to preteens and teens who 
receive information about homosexuality and same-sex 
marriages at the same time they are going through this 
normal bonding with friends of the same sex, say around the 
ages of 11 to 14?  Well, what generally happens is probably 
not much harm for children who have a large support system, 
a good family and friends, and are kind of on track 
developmentally.

<p>

But for those children who are experiencing, who 
don't have a good family support, have not done well 
developmentally, either emotionally, cognitively, or 
whatever, they are more likely to be confused or seek out 
help to resolve the confusion between these two events.  
Now, that confusion can turn into fear, and that may be a 
fear that I am, indeed, a homosexual, when they are not.

<p>

Unfortunately, I have found as a social worker 
that there are very many well-meaning but misguided 
counselors out there who would actually try to engage this 
child as young as maybe 11 or 12 years old in considering 
whether they are indeed homosexual or not, engage them in 
that kind of conversation, when they are not experiencing 
any kind of sexual maturity whatsoever.

<p>

So as this debate continues about homosexuality 
and same-sex marriages and it gains more legitimacy, I 
foresee that these topics again will just gain greater 
visibility in sex education; and if it is not presented in 
the best interest of the child but rather in the best 
interest of the homosexual rights movement, there is 
potential for great harm to these children.

<p>

[Segment from Defense of Marriage Press 
Conference, June 24, 1995, continues:]

<p>

MR. HEATH:  -- and the Christian Civic League of 
Maine is not proud to stand here in support of the Defense 
of Marriage Act because we wish that it were not necessary. 
But it is.  It is necessary because our Nation and our 
State, the State of Maine, is considering a radical cultural 
redefinition of marriage, and it is the obligation of all 
Christians in this Nation and in our State of Maine to stand 
publicly and to say, "This is not healthy, this is not a 
good, this is not an appropriate course upon which to 
embark."

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are back with more <i>Straight Talk 
from the Family Research Council</i>, where we are presenting 
the recent Defense of Marriage Briefing.

<p>

Peter LaBarbera, executive director of Accuracy in 
Academia, talks about how the homosexual activist community 
has impacted the way schools teach our children, and he 
looks at how a pro-homosexual viewpoint is advanced.

<p>

[Segment from Defense of Marriage Briefing, Capitol Hill, 
July 2, 1996, continues:]

<p>

MR. LaBARBERA:  With all the discussion about gay 
marriage in the headlines, what is really an interesting 
thing that has been transpiring across the country is the 
rush to push pro-gay measures in the schools.  It is moving 
so far and fast that I really don't think the average parent 
with children in the schools is aware of what is going on.

<p>

Ironically, just as we are meeting here right now, 
the National Education Association is meeting across town, 
and one of the things they will be debating is reversing 
Resolution B-9, which called for the celebration of Gay and 
Lesbian History Month.  Inside word from the NEA is that 
they will repudiate B-9 because it created such a stir 
across the country when parents found out that the Education 
Association was calling for this, but it will be replaced by 
another resolution which calls for increased tolerance and 
respect for gays and lesbians.  And so we are kind of seeing 
a watered-down version of the same thing, which is the 
imposition of one moral view on homosexuality in the name of 
tolerance.

<p>

I think that what people don't realize is that the 
guy activists have a big advantage over the pro-family 
movement when it comes to education and other issues.  They 
are promoting one single, radical goal, which is the 
promotion of homosexuality, while parents and others and 
just generally even conservatives are fighting a 
multiplicity of goals, and I think studies have shown that 
when you are pushing one thing, you are concentrating 
heavily on one thing, almost like a religion, it is easier 
to push that through.  And that is what we are seeing.

<p>

There is an organization that I just learned about 
a few months ago called GLISTN.  That is the acronym.  It is 
the Gay and Lesbian and Straight Teachers Network, which 
already has, by its own claims, over 3,000 members.  The 
entire purpose of GLISTN is to campaign against homophobia 
in schools and defend openly homosexual teachers in the 
classroom.

<p>

So I think it is something that is going on.  It 
is happening rapidly, and there are a lot of suppositions 
that are being made that our parents are not aware of, and 
that is the supposition that there is such a thing as a gay 
kid, gay youth.  There's a certain percentage out there of 
kids who are gay, and now they are actually using the terms, 
also, "lesbian," "bisexual," and "transgendered."  They are 
talking about gay and lesbian and transgendered youth as if 
this is a natural identity to these kids, and they are just 
assuming it to be true.

<p>

There has been no societal debate on this.  I 
don't think there has probably been much of a debate in 
educational circles about gay identity.  And yet, all over 
the country, kids are being confirmed in homosexuality.  The 
gay activists and their allies are assuming the existence of 
gay identity, and then they are saying, "Look, we have to go 
out and we have to find these kids and we have to support 
them in the midst of this homophobic society."  You actually 
see more and more focus on eradicating homophobia at even 
the K-6 level, and there is even a call, I think by a gay 
activist group called GLAD, there has been a call to use 
children's television, PBS, to eradicate homophobia.

<p>

And so we are seeing it go earlier and earlier, 
and it is all based on this supposition of born gay.  If 
they are born gay and it's fixed, you can't change it.  
Well, then, get out there and find them and support them in 
this homophobic society.

<p>

I think that what we have to realize is that so 
much of the homosexual activist agenda is based on this 
victim concept, in this whole huge field now of promoting a 
pro-gay, a gay-affirming message in the schools.  We have 
the Gay History Month which is being debated by the NEA.  
Frequently you will have somebody like Eleanor Roosevelt, 
where there are claims on one side that she was a lesbian, 
but the students are given her name, Eleanor Roosevelt, 
without any corresponding getting the information on the 
other side.  There is a debate over this.  There are two 
sides to this debate.  And so they are told somebody like 
Eleanor Roosevelt was a homosexual; they are just told that 
as a fact. 

<p>

In the more extreme cases, they are told that 
people like St. Paul and Florence Nightingale were 
homosexual as well, as this is stated as fact.  And so this 
is highly politicized history that the students are getting.

<p>

Another strategy -- this is really promoted 
heavily by GLISTN -- is the creation of gay-straight youth 
alliances in high school.  These frequently become the 
conduits of pro-homosexual politicking and propagandizing 
within the schools.

<p>

In Massachusetts, these gay-straight alliances are 
actually getting state funding.  An incredible development 
has happened in Massachusetts.  Although there is a 
Republican governor, Governor William Weld, he is also the 
most pro-gay governor in the Nation.  He has instituted 
something called the Commission on Gay Youth, which is 
promoting this victimization strategy to the point where 
they are funding these gay-straight alliances in the 
schools.

<p>

In one instance, in Dedham High School in 
Massachusetts, a gay-straight alliance got $2,000 and they 
ended up creating -- without parents knowing anything about 
it, they created a questionnaire which was passed out to all 
students in their home rooms.  One of the questions on the 
questionnaire was, "Do you feel lesbian or gay people should 
be allowed to marry?"  So we are seeing the politicization 
through the students, and of course, students like to rebel 
and they like to do things that their parents don't like, so 
it is a natural for even the talented students to go along 
with these gay-straight alliances.

<p>

Another thing that they are doing is they are 
affirming the right of openly homosexual teachers to proudly 
affirm their identity in class.  The National Educational 
Association again has defended this very much, and we will 
see more and more of this, the right of teachers to be 
openly homosexual in the classroom.  There was actually a 
teacher who declared her classroom a safe zone for gay 
students.

<p>

And lastly, again, we see the new effort now -- 
there are whole videos out within the gay activist movement 
to combat homophobia in K-6.  So they are going all the way 
down to the preschool level to start teaching about 
homosexuality.

<p>

[Segment from Defense of Marriage Press 
Conference, June 24, 1995, continues:]

<p>

MR. BARBEE:  There is just a plethora of economic
impacts that haven't been talked about hardly at all. For
example, within just federal law, within the law and the
regulations, there are over 800 sections that refer to
marriage.  With the word "spouse," there are over 3,100
references to the word "spouse" within federal law.

<p>

Now, within the beltway mentality, that tends to 
be thinking that that is all of it.  It's not all of it.
There are 50 other states that also have laws and
regulations and local governments that have ordinances that 
state and have to do with the rights that proceed from the 
definition of marriage and family and the word "spouse."

<p>

These would all be set in disarray.  Can you 
imagine the number of court cases, lawsuits, that would 
arise out of this, and the impact on businesses all across 
this country?

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We will now hear from Mary 
Beth Style, a social worker who is a former vice president 
of the National Council for Adoption.  Mary Beth's 
experience with the world of adoption is crucial to 
understanding why pairs of women or men do not trump a 
married mom and dad.

<p>

[Segment from July 2, 1996, Defense of Marriage 
Capitol Hill Briefing continues:]

<p>

MS. STYLE:  Whenever I talk about adoption, I like 
to start with reminding people what adoption is all about.  
Adoption is all about children.  It is all about the best 
interests of children and meeting the needs of children, 
creating families for children, replicating the biological 
families that children would have when their own biological 
families cannot or will not raise them.

<p>

As such, we make sure at this point that children 
have a mother and a father, which is why we terminate the 
biological parents' rights.  It is not foster care, it is 
not guardianship where biological parents retain rights and 
a child may have two mothers or two fathers.  It is adoption 
in which you have one set of parents.

<p>

One of the things that we do see is that in the 
states were adoption law occurs, there is a lot of variation 
when you are looking at time frames of when you can sign 
consents, when you can revoke consents, when you can 
overturn an adoption and things like that.  But the one 
thing that everybody is unanimous about is that an adoption 
cannot occur unless it is proven to be in the best interest 
of the child.

<p>

So one of the things that has concerned me about 
people who are trying to reform adoption laws, as they say, 
whether we are talking about gay rights or any other thing, 
is that we stop talking about children all of a sudden and 
we start talking about the rights of parents or of adults 
and the needs of adults that want to adopt, as if we can 
create a right to adopt.

<p>

There is no right to adopt, and I think we need to 
look at that rights language, because if you have a right to 
adopt, then you have a guarantee to adopt, and the state 
would have to guarantee you a child. Now, it is absurd.
It is absurd on its face, and I think we need to remember 
that.

<p>

A judge cannot grant an adoption unless it is 
shown to him that it is in the best interest of the child.
Now, there may be some differences of opinion on what is in 
the best interest of a particular child, but it still has to 
go back to that child.  Placement decisions have to be made 
on the child, and I think we need to keep that in mind.

<p>

Currently, the states do not generally say who can 
and cannot adopt, with a few exceptions where they may have 
that people with a history of abuse or are criminals, 
felons, cannot adopt.  And I am not sure I want to put on 
the books who can and cannot adopt.  Now, we do have two 
states, New Hampshire and Florida, which say that 
homosexuals cannot adopt.

<p>

I think we need to leave that open to the 
practice, because I think you need to look at each 
individual case to determine what is in the best interest of 
the child.  In most states currently -- now, we do have some 
case law that is changing this -- is that a married couple 
or a single person can adopt, but two single persons cannot 
adopt the same child.

<p>

The reason for that -- and I think that that is a 
sound policy -- is that the state believes that in order for 
two adults to parent a child, they have to have a legal 
commitment to each other.  You cannot form a family through 
a child.  The family has to be there and the child comes 
into it.

<p>

And so one of the things that we have seen is that 
the Court of Appeals in New York has just granted a 
homosexual couple and an unmarried heterosexual couple the 
right to adopt, which is a first time that that has 
happened.  Well, it is not the first time it has happened, 
but it is an exception to the rule.

<p>

One of the more celebrated cases we had where we 
had two unmarried people adopting was Woody Allen and Mia 
Farrow, and they had gotten a special exemption from a 
particular court, and we have seen the disaster of that.
Now, obviously, not all will end up like that, but it is 
important to recognize that there is a legal family, a 
committed family there, before a child goes into it.

<p>

We also, I think, don't want to allow people who 
are making placement decisions to be arbitrary in their 
decision making, but I think that we need to look at that as 
far as what is in the best interest of the child.  People 
will argue that a policy by an agency which says that an 
individual over 60 cannot adopt is arbitrary and that that 
should not happen.

<p>

But we have to remember that in adoption, we are 
responsible for the child; we are going to stack the deck 
for the child, so that while we cannot guarantee that a 35-
year-old is not going to get hit by a car, the odds are that 
there is more chance for a 35-year-old to still be around 
for that child to reach the age of maturity than for a 60-
year-old adopting that child.  And so there are some 
policies that can be discriminating in selecting individual 
families that we need to keep in place because, again, there 
is no right to adopt but there is a right for a child to 
have the best opportunity to a family.

<p>

Now, I think as far as the issue of gays and 
lesbians that we have plenty of evidence that children do 
better in a two-parent family which is a mother and a 
father.  There has been a lot of emphasis in the last year 
or so on what happens to kids without fathers.  We haven't 
paid as much attention about what happens to kids without 
mothers, but I think that all of us can understand what that 
would be.

<p>

And it is not a matter of quantity.  It is not a 
matter of two parents, because children that are raised by a 
grandmother and a mother are not doing as well as the kids 
who have a mother and a father.  Kids needs mothers and 
fathers, and I think that as we develop adoption policies, 
we have to keep children in mind rather than being concerned 
about the needs and wants of adults.  Kids don't care about 
being politically correct; they just want a mommy and a 
daddy.

<p>

[Segment from June, 24, 1995, Press Conference continues:]

<p>

MR. BROOKS:  It has been mentioned here today that 
one of the things that we are most concerned with is our 
children.  Everyone always is concerned about the next 
generation that is coming along; what are we going to teach 
our children?  And quite frankly, as this legislation moved 
through North Carolina and we heard from, in both houses in 
the committee meetings, a number of homosexual activists, 
particularly from several lesbians who talked about raising 
children in their families and how some of their children 
were becoming homosexuals and some of their children, a few 
of them, were not, it really did a lot to let legislators 
understand that this is a critical issue; that in fact who 
raises these children is an important part of where we going 
to be down the road.

<p>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>.

<p>

We now bring you some intriguing questions from 
those who attended the recent Defense of Marriage Briefing, 
and the answers, not often heard beyond a quick sound bite, 
from the experts who spoke.

<p>

[Segment from July 2, 1996, Defense of Marriage Briefing continues:]

<p>

QUESTION: Dr. Satinover, when you were talking
about the evidence that is there stating what you had (said)
in your opening statement, what do you see as the primary
barrier for getting that evidence to mainstream America?
You mentioned the media.  Is it more than just the media?
And if it is the media, what does it have to gain by
precluding that evidence?

<p>

DR. SATINOVER: I think probably the major reason 
that that evidence doesn't get out there is because of the 
tremendous reservoir of sympathy and good will that most 
Americans harbor for people who are in any kind of trouble 
and who are put upon.

<p>

The truth of the matter is that homosexuality 
afflicts a very small minority of the population.
Obviously, that figure itself has been the subject of some 
dispute.  Probably 3 percent is a good scientific, 
replicable percentage.  And there is no question that 
homosexuals suffer tremendous emotional distress both in 
their early personal lives and also in the way that they are 
frequently treated by others.

<p>

When they began to organize as a group and made a 
plea for sympathy, I think most people felt that, yes, that 
is right, we owe it to them.  And it became very, very
difficult, as the whole picture began to change and
determined efforts were made to paint a portrait of the
scientific evidence that was different than the truth, it
really became very difficult for people to be motivated to
take the time and trouble and argue against it. The
majority of people really didn't care about it. It didn't
affect them, and so why make trouble?

<p>

And the truth is that you can get into a 
considerable amount of difficulty by crossing gay activism, 
especially within the professions.  They have made an 
attempt within the American Psychiatric Association to make 
it an ethical violation for a psychiatrist to help treat a 
homosexual who wishes to change, even if that is what the 
person himself wants.  So a lot of people have been 
basically intimidated into just walking away from it.

<p>

However, it has gone too far, and in my view, the 
real problem that we need to look at is not so much gay 
activism as it is the very, very large number of people who 
wish to leave homosexuality.  The relationship -- there is a 
strong correlation between broken families and the next 
generation's incidence of homosexuality.  We are witnessing 
now the problems that began in this society 20, 30, 40 years 
ago, and there are a tremendous number of people out there 
who need our help, and it absolutely will do no good 
whatsoever for us to say, "This problem doesn't really touch 
me.  I'm just going to deal with it on a political level.
Let 'them' have what they want."  Because that will teach 
the younger rising generation precisely the wrong lesson.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: Gay political activists say that 
they are really for exclusions in discrimination concerning 
the churches in America, the temples and churches in 
America.  But if gay marriage is accepted into the civil 
government in America, what would stop the gay political 
activists from coming up now to the church level and saying, 
"Hey, you know, it's accepted in the civil government, and 
unless you accept active homosexuals into the churches, then 
we are going to withdraw your 501(c)(3) status, your tax-exempt 
status"?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes, I think that is a very real 
threat.  A lot of the gay activists have said, "Look, we'll 
allow ministers to perform the usual type of wedding and to 
bar homosexual weddings."  I think what they are leaving out 
is, "for now."  Because once you are outside the civil law, 
once the churches' rules are said to be immoral, because the 
law says they are wrong, this situation cannot hold for very 
long.  We have seen other situations in which religious 
exemptions once granted were taken away once the government 
felt there was a compelling interest to do so.

<p>

I can foresee a time when there will be -- if all 
these gay rights laws are in place, and some churches 
perform same-sex weddings -- that the ones that do not will 
be seen as suspect, as churches themselves, and we may find 
ourselves in the situation that the people of the Soviet 
Union were in where these churches might be allowed to 
perform their own ceremonies and have services behind closed 
doors but have no public life at all.  They will be 
outcasts.

<p>

So when you put gay rights into the law, you are 
slowly and surely ghettoizing the churches and saying that 
you're no longer part of the civil code here.  That's very 
dangerous.

<p>

QUESTION: I think it was you that mentioned that 
most gay activists don't really intend to harm the family.
Mr. Knight, you were using words like "tyranny" and "aiming
to achieve raw power."  Is there any way to assess if there 
is an aim or a goal of this body?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  We may disagree.  I think they are 
out to harm the family based on their own statements.
Michelangelo Signorelli(?) is not alone.  Paula 
Edelbrich(?), who is legal director of Lambda Legal Defense 
Fund, which is bringing many of these cases, is not even a 
fan of marriage because she said it isn't radical enough.
"We want to completely, radically alter the institution of 
the family."  And other activists have said so.

<p>

I am not saying that homosexuals feel that way; I 
am saying homosexual activists are aiming at that. A lot of 
homosexuals are sitting on the sidelines just saying, "Leave 
me alone.  I don't want to get involved in this."  That's 
not who I am talking about.  I am talking about the activist 
movement here.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: I think it is very important to 
point out that most homosexuals are not activists.  I was in 
that myself for nine years, and many of us were not really 
involved.  The homosexual activists seem to be speaking for 
the majority of homosexuals.  Most homosexuals don't even 
want to be associated with the political movement in this 
country.  I don't think it is more than 5 percent of the 
homosexual population in this country that are connected to 
the gay political movement, and I think that needs to be 
addressed.

<p>

[Segment from June 24, 1995, press conference continues:]

<p>

MR. ZANOTTI:  If we liken marriage to a kite in 
the wind, we could observe that over recent generations the 
string that holds it in the sky has been fraying.  Sometimes 
the kite doesn't look that good up there.  Sometimes it is 
not as shiny and as brilliant as we once thought it was, and 
we wonder how far it can eventually travel, if our culture 
does not deal with this issue today, if we do not pass DOMA, 
if we do not hear the cries from across the Nation, of state 
after state after state, if we permit marriage to be 
redefined according to the proponents of same-sex marriage 
who define it accordingly.  It is best understood as a 
relationship of financial interdependence between two people 
who make a public commitment.  If this happens, we will cut 
the string of marriage forever, and our culture will drift 
off with no control.

<p>

Mark the hour.  It's somewhere around 10:17.  Mark 
the day.  This is the 24th of June.  In 16 years in the 
public policy business, we have taken quite a practice to 
studying history.  If you are a student of history, you will 
have noticed the different dialects, the different 
geography, the different approaches, and it will sound a lot 
like debates that have happened before in this Nation, and I 
would caution you to note this day in history, because this 
is the kind of debate that rents the soul of a nation.  It 
rips the soul of a nation; it tears it.  This is the kind of 
debate that gets out of hand.

<p>

"These are the times that try men's souls," has 
been once before stated in our culture.  Mark the hour and 
mark the day, because this sounds like places our Nation has 
been before, places that have cost huge human sacrifices in 
life.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i> we are discussing what once
was the foundation of families and cultures: marriage.

<p>

Unfortunately, the institution of marriage battles 
daily for the esteem it once held, and the reasons for this 
erosion range from the breakdown in values to the laws which 
allow individuals to hastily rid themselves of a difficult 
situation.

<p>

Is it possible to have both love and marriage?
We'll be talking to columnist and author Maggie Gallagher, 
whose most recent book, <i>The Abolition of Marriage</i>, takes 
a look at why marriage is collapsing and some ways to rebuild 
cherished lifelong relationships.

<p>

But first, let's hear from Gary Bauer, president 
of the Family Research Council.  Gary takes an analytical 
look at the approaching elections and the strategy political 
parties are employing.  It has already been an interesting 
road to election day.

<p>

So let's hear from Gary to see what he foresees 
for the journey ahead as Straight Talk takes you Behind the 
Headlines.

<p>
<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Gary, thank you so much for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.

<p>

You know, there has been a lot of conversation 
lately by media and political analysts about the way in 
which the Republicans are playing their hand versus the way 
the Democratic Party is playing its hand.

<p>

You've got Bill Clinton with the issue of the week 
and Bob Dole saying, you know, "Look, I'm going to bring my 
strategy out later."  You've got the Democrats on the Hill 
bringing forward new legislation even in the ninth hour of 
the legislative session, and the Republicans sort of trying 
to clean up old business and doing a lot of behind-the-scenes, 
quiet negotiating that we're not hearing about.  Do you think 
this is an effective strategy?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, I think the Republican Party has 
a problem right now.  I think a lot of folks around the 
country are really hoping that they'll get a little bit more 
aggressive in putting the program out for the American 
people to examine.

<p>

It's kind of ironic, because I think most 
Americans are close or closer to where the Republican Party 
is on these issues, whether it's lowering taxes, smaller 
government, traditional values, or whatever.  The polling 
data is pretty overwhelming.  And so it's sort of ironic 
that the party seems to not be able to find its legs right 
now to be promoting those things.

<p>

I would love to see and hope that Bob Dole, for 
example, will emphasize in the weeks ahead the need for 
massive tax cuts.  The American people want tax cuts.  It 
will get the economy moving strongly, which is what we all 
want.  And yet the issue seems to not exist right now 
because the party hasn't brought it up.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Tax cuts are a great example.  As 
you know, Bill Clinton talked about the middle-class tax 
cut, and one never appeared; and the Republicans, in their 
Contract with America, said, "Look, we're going to go for a 
$500-per-child tax cut," and there's a lot of quiet again 
behind the scenes negotiating.  Maybe it will be on one 
appropriations bill, maybe another.

<p>

And yet Bill Clinton, who has raised taxes, is 
talking a lot about tax cuts; Bob Dole again saying very 
little.  What's the problem here?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Yes, this is really bizarre.  I saw a 
poll the other day that just was unbelievable to me.  It 
asked the question, "Who do you think is most likely to 
lower your taxes?"  And Bob Dole and Bill Clinton were 
basically tied on that question.  Now, this is absurd.  Bill 
Clinton put through one of the most massive tax increases in 
the history of the country right at the beginning of his 
administration.  As you just alluded to, he promised a 
middle-class tax cut which never materialized.

<p>

Senator Dole has advocated tax relief for years.  
And yet to the general public, the two candidates right now 
are indistinguishable.

<p>

I think that kind of a poll ought to be a reminder 
to the Republican National Committee that you cannot assume 
that people out of Washington understand these differences. 
We've got to remind them every day.  And certainly Senator 
Dole and the Republican Party need to remind the American 
people every day that they're the party of lower taxes and 
tax relief.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It seems like Bill Clinton has taken 
a page out of Newt Gingrich's playbook with his issues of 
the week, and Newt had, of course, the Contract with 
America, talking about this is what I'm running on; Bill 
Clinton bringing forward his own agenda items.  Do you find 
some irony there?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, yes, there is a lot of irony 
there. In fact, Senator Dole, I think, suggested the other 
day that maybe Bill Clinton just ought to get a big sign 
that says "Me, too," and then every time Senator Dole takes 
a position, Clinton could stand up and hold up the sign. I 
think the point that Senator Dole was trying to make is that 
the President has been co-opting many of these issues.

<p>

There's an interesting thing here to notice.  The 
issues that the President is going out on are not really 
federal issues.  In the last couple of weeks, we have had 
the President say he is for school uniforms.  We've had them 
introduce a federal initiative on school truancy.  I mean, 
however much one might be happy that the President is saying 
these things, they have almost nothing to do with 
Washington, D.C.

<p>

Truancy, the problem of school truancy, is a 
problem for local school districts.  The decision of whether 
students will wear uniforms to class or not is a decision 
for local school districts to make.

<p>

But the President is very astute.  By taking a 
stand on these positions, he sends a message to voters that, 
culturally, he is traditional, the way they are.  And he 
avoids needing to do anything about these matters because 
they really aren't Washington or Presidential issues.  

<p>

So he gets the advantage of talking about them 
without really having to take any sort of action.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It would seem as though the 
Republicans are keeping their powder dry for some future 
date.  Would that be your advice to them?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, my good friend George Bush kept 
his powder dry for what appears in retrospect to have been 
an entire campaign, and unfortunately, instead of getting 
reelected, he ended up losing to Bill Clinton.

<p>

I have never understood what happened during that 
campaign.  George Bush was and is a good and decent man.  He 
had a great program he could have run on, and it just never 
seemed to get explained to the American people.  I hope that 
Bob Dole is not going to make the same mistake this year.

<p>

Bill Clinton is an incredible campaigner.  You've 
got to take your hat off to him.  He really makes his case 
and does it well.  I don't think they should wait till the 
convention.  I don't think they should wait till Labor Day, 
which some advisers are [suggesting].  I think the campaign 
is going on now and that Bob Dole needs to outline his 
vision for the future of the country and how to take the 
American people into the next century.

<p>

You have to say the things you are for, the things 
you believe in, and you've got to do it over and over and 
over again.  It's like telling your wife you love her.  You 
can't say it too many times.  It takes that to get through 
all the din and noise that the American people are subjected 
to.

<p>

So I would urge Bob Dole and the Republican Party 
every day to bring up taxes, to bring up the need for 
smaller government, to bring up the need for a strong 
defense, to bring up traditional values, family issues, and 
to do that right through the campaign, through the summer, 
through the conventions, through the campaign, and begin to 
explain to the American people the differences between that 
party and the party that Bill Clinton heads up, which tends 
to believe in higher taxes, big government, more regulation, 
and so forth.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One of Clinton's advisors said that 
the way that you know what America really understands and 
talks about in terms of a campaign is by watching the late 
shows; Jay Leno and David Letterman are an indicator of what 
people understand about politics.  And we've heard a lot 
lately about seances and Hillary Clinton talking with 
Eleanor Roosevelt, and it has been quite a big joke.  And 
yet the Clinton White House struck back very quickly, 
saying, "Look, other people have done it.  Nancy Reagan has 
done it.  Jackie Kennedy talked with Lincoln," something 
that I don't think most people had ever heard before.  Do 
you think that that is an effective way of dealing with it?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, you know the old saying, the 
best defense is a strong offense.  The Clinton team really 
nailed this down four years ago, again in the Bush campaign.  
They formed a quick-response team whose job it was to 
literally respond within hours of any Republican attack, and 
they did that consistently through the campaign.  If George 
Bush made a point in the morning, by the time the evening 
news played that night, there was a response from James 
Carville and Stephanopoulos and the other wordsmiths around 
the President.

<p>

They are doing the same thing now, and it is very 
effective.  Again, I think my Republican friends could take 
a page out of this handbook and realize that no charge 
against Bob Dole ought to be allowed to linger for days 
without somebody in the party responding to it.  We are 
living in a media age where the attention span is very 
short.  Stories come and go literally within a matter of 
hours, and I think it is very important for the Republicans 
to be just as quick on the response as the Clinton White 
House is.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Lately there has been some analysis 
by conservative media critics talking about the incredible 
barrier that a Republican has to overcome in terms of 
getting any kind of positive echo from the media, while a 
Democratic candidate or official really does have a 
resonance with the media on a lot of issues.

<p>

David Fromme(?) from <i>The Weekly Standard</i> said 
lately, "Well, sure, the President gets some negative press. 
But wouldn't anybody if they were accused of womanizing and 
skirt-chasing and bad loan deals and campaign finance 
problems?  I mean, how much do you have to go through before 
you get a couple of bad press stories?"

<p>

But do you think that these character issues are 
going to have a negative effect?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, first, let me address the 
question about the media.  This city is still talking about 
a study that was done earlier in the summer that showed that 
only 4 percent of Washington-based reporters said that they 
were registered Republicans.  Now, are we really to believe 
that that has no impact on the way the news is reported?  It 
has to have an impact.  People are normal human beings.  
Their biases, their prejudices inevitably are going to seep 
into the coverage.  So Republicans and conservatives do have 
a higher bar to jump, and it is something that they are 
going to have to deal with for years into the future.

<p>

The character issue is a troubling one because, as 
you indicated, there are certainly a lot of character 
problems evident in the Clinton Administration.  I was 
talking to Senator Nickles the other day after he had just 
come off the floor of the Senate, where he was attempting to 
summarize in a half-hour, in a floor speech in the Senate, 
those character issues, and he said, "Gary, the half-hour 
was over and I hadn't gotten through half of them."  And he 
could not think of any recent administration, certainly any 
administration in the 20th century, that had this many 
character issues or values-related issues to deal with.

<p>

Will it make a difference on election day?  I 
don't know.  I certainly think character issues and value 
issues can weaken the standing of the President.  But I 
think, at the end of the day, probably, unfortunately, 
Americans go into the voting booth and vote on who they 
think has a vision for the future.  I think they are 
troubled by scandal, they are troubled by somebody that 
might have engaged in inappropriate activities.  But at the 
end of the day, they want to know which candidate is going 
to build an America that is going to be better for them, 
their jobs, their children, their families.

<p>

And so while I would encourage the Republicans to 
keep talking about character, I don't think, when the 
election is over, that that will be a substitute for putting 
forth a coherent vision of how you want to govern the 
country and what you hope for the American people.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The Democratic Party -- and Bill 
Clinton in particular -- has very much pursued alternative 
media strategies.  They have gone to MTV, they have done the 
late shows, they have looked at where the counterculture is. 
The Republicans, on the whole, have stayed with a more 
traditional approach, doing network television advertising, 
sticking with the weekend news analysis shows, much more 
standard in their approach.

<p>

Do you think that the Republicans would benefit 
from pursuing an alternative media strategy?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, I think they need to be aware 
that there are obviously a lot more choices now for the 
American people than there used to be in the media, and 
you've got to get beyond just the three major networks.  But 
I wouldn't advise them to do what Clinton did in the early 
years of his Presidency and during the 1992 campaign, where 
he went on MTV and answered questions about what kind of 
underwear he wore and went on stage with Al Gore as the 
blues brothers, and so forth.

<p>

You will notice that in the last couple of years 
you don't see that anymore, that in fact the President tries 
to act Presidential, which is a good thing for a President 
to do.

<p>

I would not try to kowtow to the cultural values 
of MTV.  I would use MTV for regular ads to present the 
Republican message and the conservative message.  But I 
don't think you've got to do the sorts of things that Bill 
Clinton did that I thought were, quite frankly, rather 
embarrassing for a President of the United States.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: At the end of the day, Gary, what do 
you think will determine who our next President will be?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, you know, this is really a very 
basic issue.  Every public opinion poll shows that America 
is basically a conservative country.  We just saw a study in 
the last couple of weeks where literally 20 issues were 
outlined, and I believe on 17 of the 20 the American people 
came down on the conservative side.

<p>

That being the case, the most conservative 
candidate ought to win the election, and there is absolutely 
no doubt to anyone in this city that Bob Dole is the 
conservative candidate and that Bill Clinton is the liberal 
candidate.  Around the country, however, the public, the 
voter, seems confused about that.

<p>

So I think the election will rise and fall on who 
is able to make the articulate case for conservative values. 
That ought to be Bob Dole, and I hope that he will meet that 
challenge and outline that vision.  If he doesn't do that, 
then I think the American people, out of confusion, may in 
fact reelect the President.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you, Gary, so much for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.

<p>

MR. BAUER: Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will 
introduce you to a nationally known author, Maggie 
Gallagher, who discusses her book, <i>The Abolition of 
Marriage</i>, and provides key insight into what has caused the 
marriage foundation to crumble.  Stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[Segment from the Heritage Foundation's "The Collape of 
Marriage" Panel Discussion held May 15, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MR. ADAM MEYERSON: The collapse of marriage is 
the number one cause of poverty in this country.  It's the 
number one cause of crime.  It's a major cause of suicide.  
It's a major cause of our educational breakdown.  The 
collapse of marriage also threatens the very future of 
democracy.

<p>

Our republic is based on the self-evident truth 
that all men and women are endowed by our Creator with the 
right to pursue happiness.  Do we have that right if our 
most important institution for providing happiness is 
crumbling before our eyes?

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER:  I really don't believe that we are 
going to be a society characterized by faith, hope, 
optimism, and upward mobility if we live in a society in 
which marriage, as it is rapidly becoming, ceases to be the 
normal way in which we raise children.

<p>

The giving of yourself in a lifelong commitment to 
another human being is the most extraordinary thing most of 
us will ever do.  With the abolition of marriage, that last 
possibility for heroism is being taken from us.

<p>

[End of segment.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We saw a bit of Maggie's insight 
regarding marriage and the struggles men and women face 
today.  But now let's meet the woman of the hour, Maggie 
Gallagher, a syndicated columnist whose most recent book, 
<i>The Abolition of Marriage</i>, has received acclaim in 
publications across the country.

<p>

Maggie, thanks so much for being with us today.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And I want to hold this up, <i>The 
Abolition of Marriage</i>. We are going to be certainly talking 
about it throughout the hour.

<p>

I think what is interesting to me about it is the 
subtext, "How We Destroy Lasting Love," because I think the 
idea is that Cinderella, throughout all the great women of 
mythological American history, that somehow you find your 
love and you have your love, and then they lived happily 
ever after.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Well, and it is also about, too 
often, the divorce culture that we live in is portrayed as a 
great good, you know, that we are freer, we are better off, 
we are happier.  And I don't really think so.  I don't think 
that the kind of culture that we are building, that a 
society where your spouse is no longer trustworthy, that we 
can't really count on those marriage bonds for something so 
basic as helping us raise our children, I don't think that 
women, in particular, are freer or better off, and I think 
that we are losing something very precious.  It's a false 
gain.  We're not really more free, but what we are is much 
more anxious, and we have much less faith in the possibility 
of lasting love, and that is what I really wanted to get 
into with this book.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think that the culture of 
divorce itself is a self-fulfilling prophecy?  Divorces 
happen, divorce is easy, divorce could happen to me; 
therefore, maybe my marriage isn't good?

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER:  Yes, I do.  I think we're on a 
downward spiral.  I don't think that, by itself, the 
situation will turn around.  You see this in kind of social 
science research that shows that children of divorce are 
both more likely to divorce, themselves, and more likely to 
become unwed parents.  And it is very obvious when you talk 
to these kids why that is true.

<p>

A society which tells people, and tells women in 
particular, that they have a right to be a single parent 
through divorce is going to have a hard time telling the 
next generation that it's important to be married before you 
have children or that a father is a very important part of 
the family, if they didn't have a father as part of their 
family.

<p>

And what everyone experiences, whether they have 
ever divorced or their parents ever divorced or not, is a 
much higher level of anxiety and fear of betrayal.  You 
know, if you do trust your spouse, there's a part of you 
that always ends up wondering, Am I being a fool?  And there 
a lot of people out there telling you that you are a fool if 
you depend on your husband or your wife in any way, because 
the message we're getting is you can't count on anyone, and 
that's not a recipe for a healthy society or a happy person.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I think that is a really interesting 
point, being married now almost four years myself.  When my 
husband and I first got married, you would think that people 
would be congratulating you and be very excited about your 
marriage.  And yet I would have to say that the most 
consistent message is, "Now you're going to have problems.  
You think you're happy now.  Give yourself six months, give 
yourself a year."  And since we have made it four years, and 
I would have to say that it has been better every year, I 
guess I don't know when the magic now comes.

<p>

But I was very fascinated by that, about the 
negative way in which everyone encourages you to get married 
and then, on the brink of engagement and married life, tells 
you, "Ah, you're going to have real problems."

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: I think probably even more common 
on the part of the watchers, anyway, if not the 
participants, instead of any person's marriage being a kind 
of reaffirmation, this one moment where we watch something 
extraordinary happen -- two people become one -- there is 
this kind of subtext which is always, well, is this going to 
last?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER:  You know, here we are; we're going 
to give the gifts; we're going to rearrange all our 
relationships.  But is it all going to fall apart or not?

<p>

I do think what you say about happiness, 
everything we know is that marriage is very important for 
people's happiness; that people who don't marry or who are 
divorced as a group are not, by their own accounts, very 
happy people.  They have many more problems, health 
problems, both serious and those that are related to stress.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER:  You know, having a person in your 
life that you can count on, that kind of commitment, which 
is the marriage bond, is very important, and we are made to 
be -- not all of us will marry, but we were really clearly, 
the two sexes were made for each other and made for the kind 
of relationship that marriage contains.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  One thing I wanted to ask you, in 
particular, was certainly almost every culture has come from 
a setting in which marriages were arranged, in which 
marriage was not, per se, a romantic adventure, but it had 
the potential to become that, and many people -- actually, 
as a matter of fact, I had an interesting conversation with 
a cabbie on a very long ride not too long ago, telling me 
about how much he loves his wife, whom he met on the day of 
his wedding, and they are from Pakistan.

<p>

What I wanted to ask you was, if you look at that 
historical perspective in which so many marriages have not 
arisen out of romantic candlelight dinners and have a much 
more lasting quality than marriages in America today, why do 
you think, even from our own history -- are these women 
afraid to divorce, or is there something really different 
about marriages in some other cultural contexts?

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: I think there is a difference.  I 
want to say, first of all, that we should not underestimate 
how unique the Christian/Western tradition is, and in fact, 
the idea of the consent of the bride, the idea of connecting 
love and marriage, is actually quite old in our own culture, 
and certainly for as long as America has existed, people 
have been making what they saw as love matches, even though 
they may not have placed as much attention to some of the 
romantic frou-frou in those days.

<p>

But I do think there is something important to be 
learned from that.  We tend to think that as marriage 
collapses and we get this high divorce rate that the answer 
is just -- some people say, Make marriage harder, and the 
idea is, just look really, really carefully for the exact 
right person.  And the fact that arranged marriages work so 
well is a hint to me that how you love after you are married 
is probably more important to the success of your marriage 
than finding someone whose personality exactly fits yours, 
because the reality is, even if you found that perfect match 
at the moment that you married, life changes and people 
change, and if your marriage is going to last, it has to 
come from some kind of commitment to that whole person.

<p>

And the other thing about that is that our 
mentality is very consumerist.  It is like, who is exactly 
the right person for me?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: And for marriage to work, both 
people have to be at least equally and hopefully more 
concerned with how can I be the right person for my spouse; 
how do I love this person well?

<p>

I think that that kind of image of marriage, 
recognition that it is not really about our own internal 
feelings, it is about a real other person that we are 
willing to commit to, to care for and take care of in the 
ways that husbands and wives do, is part of what we need to 
recapture more fully.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think Hollywood certainly 
contributes to that flavor-of-the-month mentality about 
marriage:  Well, I am sure another good wife is coming along 
any moment.

<p>

But I want to talk more about how we love after 
marriage when we come back.  And when we come back, we will 
hear more from Maggie and the reasons why marriage seems to 
be crumbling.  Please stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We're back with more <i>Straight Talk 
from the Family Research Council</i>, where we are continuing 
our discussion about marriage and, most importantly, what 
makes a successful marriage, with Maggie Gallagher, author 
of Enemies of Eros(?), and her most recent book, <i>The 
Abolition of Marriage</i>. Welcome back, Maggie.

<p>

We were talking before the break about how people 
do love after marriage, and it seems so many books talk 
about, especially, you know, even bag(?) books for a second, 
because people aren't always as good readers as we wish, but 
you've got Cosmopolitan and El Magazine and everybody 
telling you, if you have sex in this way or you have this 
kind of food or whatever, that you're going to catch the 
right man, but not a lot of conversation about what do you 
do once you have this man.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: I am also struck particularly in 
the messages that have been sent to women and what I call 
women's culture, and you are talking about things from Oprah 
and the whole set of daytime shows to People magazine and 
the women's magazines, and for many years they have been 
very, perhaps unconsciously, anti-marriage.

<p>

You look at how many -- go to your supermarket 
sometime and just think about how many covers of People 
magazine in the last -- that you have seen have been about, 
I'm 40, I dumped the geek, I'm free, I'm happy, right?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: And the message that you're 
sending women there is that if you haven't dumped the geek 
and you're still staying in a struggling marriage, there 
must be something wrong with you.  Obviously, the first 
thing you need to do to be happy is to get rid of your 
husband.

<p>

I think that there has a little bit of a turn more 
towards marriage as we see how difficult divorced life can 
be for women, particularly women with children, and for men, 
too, for that matter.  But still there has been directed 
particularly at women, I think, a lot of very hostile 
messages.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You know, what is funny about that 
is at Family Research Council I certainly field hundreds of 
media calls sometimes even in a day, and one of the things 
that has come up as there has been sort of a reemergence of 
marriage is, don't I think that the culture of AIDS has 
really encouraged the reemergence of marriage?  Everyone is 
afraid to get a deadly disease, so they're going to make it 
work.

<p>

But, you know, I don't agree, and I am interested 
in your reaction to this.  I think marriage has reemerged 
because so many people recognize that divorce is not the 
easy answer that it has been made to be, that you can be 
very unhappy and realize that that husband or wife wasn't so 
bad.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: You know, I think that AIDS gave 
some well-educated women who perhaps weren't religious an 
acceptable reason to say no, which they were dying for, but 
it isn't the prime impetus.  It is partly the ongoing 
research literature, which now shows very clearly that 
divorce is very harmful for children, on average; that you 
have two to three times the risk of a whole host of things, 
from psychological disorders, education failures, risk of 
becoming a criminal; and that when you follow these kids to 
adult life, they are, on average, less happy.  They are less 
successful and they are less happy.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And they are very much more 
stressed.  There is a lot of uneasiness.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Yes, and we have come to this 
theory that you have just a short crisis and then kids 
adjust and it doesn't really matter whether they have both 
of their parents cooperating and raising them together in a 
married family or not.  I mean, that was a lot happy talk 
which has nothing to do with reality.

<p>

I think that the research confirmation, the expert 
opinion, but really, what you are talking about is people's 
experience.  I mean, we all now have been living in this 
culture for 30 years.  Those happy myths about how divorce 
is better for the kids, et cetera, et cetera, if I am happy, 
my kids will be happy -- we know how hard it is when 
marriage breaks up on both the adults and especially on the 
children, and we are looking for answers.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I would like to ask you -- and I 
will throw out some of my own -- what you consider to be 
some of the worst myths about marriage right now.  I think, 
from my perspective with a lot of friends at the beginning 
of their marriages, I think one of the worst myths is that, 
having gotten married, you have finished something, when I 
don't think you have finished anything.  You have begun 
something, and making your marriage is a constant renewal.  
You know, having gotten my job, I am not done.  I am 
actually expected to go and accomplish something.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: There are very few novels that are 
about being married; they are mostly about getting a 
spouse --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Yes, they are.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: -- a husband or a wife, and 
living happily ever after.  Yes, I think there is something 
to that, and it feeds into, again -- the way I think about 
this, Kristi, is marriage basically a creative or productive 
institution or act, or is it a consumption item?  I think it 
is what we produce in life that makes us happy and that it 
is important to recognize that what we're doing when we're 
getting married is building something.  We are making 
something, a relationship with our spouse and a new family 
in most cases; and that in the long run it is our success at 
achieving that, at making that, which is going to make us 
happy, even if we're not happy all the time in the middle of 
that; and that, if we turn around and say, well, "Am I being 
made happy enough to stay married?" what you have done is 
turned your spouse from your principal responsibility, your 
vocation in life, to being just a thing, an object that you 
use up, and if you are not getting what you want, you trade 
them in.

<p>

That is very destructive to love.  It is a habit 
of the heart which is very destructive to both human 
happiness, human virtue, and the ability to love.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: How important is marriage to children? 
You see a lot of conversation today in many contexts, 
whether it be homosexual marriage discussions or 
cohabiting people talking, that if you have one or two or 
three loving people, you know, as long as there is love, 
that children are okay.  But how important is marriage to 
children?

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: There have been so experiments in 
the last couple of hundred years, really, with alternate 
family forms, and they all end up dissolving at sort of even 
greater rates than marriage, whatever its imperfections.

<p>

Marriage is key.  It's the way we give children fathers. It's 
the way we teach children that the family is important, that 
family relationships can be counted on. Every person -- and 
I know there are tragic situations where a divorce or a 
separation is necessary -- but every time you divorce as a 
parent, one message you are sending your children is that 
family relationships can appear and disappear, you can be 
related and unrelated, and that in some way, then, love is not 
reliable.

<p>

That message, even if your child doesn't become a 
drug user or depressed or a juvenile delinquent and gets 
good grades and goes to a good college, when you talk to 
children of divorce, that comes out very, very powerfully.  
When they go to love, to marry, to form families, they carry 
with them this enormous burden of fear of betrayal, because 
the lesson their life taught them is that love is not 
reliable, and that is a very hard less to teach a child.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I would think that the social 
repercussions of that are going to affect us for many years, 
and I would like to ask you a little bit more about that in 
just a moment.

<p>

Please stay tuned for more words of wisdom 
regarding marriage, divorce, and love from Maggie Gallagher 
when <i>Straight Talk</i> returns.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. I would like to welcome once 
again Maggie Gallagher, who is sharing her research and 
insights from her latest book, <i>The Abolition of Marriage</i>. 
Welcome back, Maggie.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We were talking before the break 
about people carrying into marriage, children of divorce, 
even if they have managed to successfully complete school, 
this sense of I don't know what is going to last, what ties 
are real.

<p>

I was wondering if you could sort of look at that 
from a societal benefit. We were talking before. At the 
movie <i>Braveheart</i>, I was watching it and was kind of struck 
by the fact that these men and women were bound by their 
clan, by kinship and these blood lines, and because of that, 
they were going to fight and die together; and how, today, 
we have sort of made kinship optional.  Maybe you're 
related, maybe you're not.  I mean, these ties are very 
breakable.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: And that is the biggest change, 
really, in the post-marital family, is that you don't have 
one family where everyone has the same ties and the same 
loyalties.  It is like you have certain relationships, your 
children have -- and some of your children may have 
different ones, and the only tie that still remains 
reasonably firm is the tie between mother and child.  Even 
for fathers, 10 years after divorce, two-thirds of fathers 
have virtually no regular contact with their children.

<p>

We are raising children, increasingly, in a world 
where all relationships are temporary and disposable, and it 
is very difficult for children to prosper or really for 
anyone to prosper in a world that is that really emotionally 
chaotic.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It seems to me that that really has 
implications from a national perspective.  There has been a 
lot of talk lately in pro-family circles about a need to 
rebuild a sense of American citizenship or of what does it 
mean to be an American, and yet we are talking there about a 
national consciousness. about a national tie, when what we 
have really communicated through a divorce-prone country is 
that ties are optional.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Yes.  I don't think, as I said, 
that either the conservative ideal of a limited government 
and a strong nation or the more general American dream of 
upward mobility, each generation better off than the last, I 
don't think it is going to happen unless we begin to deal 
with this.

<p>

Kristi, in just 10 years from now, if current 
trends continue, half of our children will be born outside 
of wedlock.  Half of the remainder will lose their fathers 
through divorce.  That means marriage is going to become, 
almost as a lifelong family-forming union, is going to 
become almost a cult practice, a rare minority.  And I don't 
think we as a nation will survive that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Is everyone equally likely to 
divorce?  You know, we see half of all marriages do this, 70 
percent of the population does that, and that is very 
chilling to many.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Yes. No, it isn't. It is not 
spread uniformly, and there are a lot of different variables 
that affect it.  If you and your husband are both married 
for the first time, you will have a significantly lower 
divorce rate than if one of you has been divorced before.  
People who attend church or synagogue or temple regularly -- 
it actually doesn't seem to matter from the standpoint of 
holding marriages together what your religious denomination 
is -- if you're active in it, you have a lower divorce rate.

<p>

In general, educated and relatively affluent 
people have lower divorce rates than the poor, except for 
one very interesting exception.  Marriages in which both 
partners work full time have much more income, but they are 
also much more divorce prone.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Why do you think that is?  Because 
you can't pick up the newspaper today without seeing a rise 
in two-income families.  And, frankly, at the Family 
Research Council we have been concerned about that, not 
because women shouldn't work but because a lot of women work 
to offset the tax burden on the American family.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Oh, sure. I think that it 
reflects a lot of disappointment. I mean, when women get 
married and have babies, it's a lot of work, and one of the 
reasons you undertake that work is because you want to spend 
time with your kids, you want a family life, you want to 
build a family life, and if, instead, you are having to 
spend all of your time working, it makes all of the 
frustrations of family life seem a lot worse to you.

<p>

Basically, I think a lot of women aren't getting 
what they wanted, which may be not necessarily working or 
not working but not being the primary breadwinners for their 
family.

<p>

It also, frankly, partly reflects, Kristi, 
sometimes when couples both become very career-oriented, 
there is not a lot of time left for the marriage.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: They are just two people who are 
both more invested in their careers than their family life, 
and people like that are more prone to divorce.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have actually seen a lot of data 
on that in which people say that the give point is the 
marriage.  I mean, you can look at that statistically.  If 
you have home, husband, children, career, outside activities 
-- outside activities do tend to dissipate, depending on 
whether they are connected to your job -- but that, 
ultimately, it is that primary relationship between husband 
and wife, that is the easiest to put aside and say, "Well, 
we'll spend quality time later.  We obviously need to take 
care of our job and kids."

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Right. Well, those are the not 
optional, I guess.  They won't give you the pay check if you 
don't show up, and kids have a way of making themselves 
felt, so people often feel -- and again, I think it is 
worse, either if you are family-oriented and frustrated in 
that desire, you are going to be more frustrated with your 
spouse in your life and feel like you're not getting what 
you're supposed to be.

<p>

And then there is the opposite: if you are not 
family-oriented, if you primarily get your sense of self-worth 
from your job, you are going to be a prime candidate 
for divorce, anyway, and working doesn't cause it; it just 
reflects that orientation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, that is an interesting point 
that you bring up because, I mean, if you read again 
feminist literature or even your average glamour magazine, 
you are certainly going to get the message as a woman that 
your career -- don't let anything interrupt your career.  
That above all things is sacrosanct.  You know, you can put 
your children in day care and you can get another husband, 
but your career is the center.

<p>

And you are saying that the more connected your 
self-worth is to your career, the higher your possibility of 
divorce?

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Well, I am not saying this is a 
fact.  I mean, it is a fact that two full-time working 
couples are more likely to divorce -- it does not apply, by 
the way, to part-time working wives -- but I mean, I think 
that if you talk to therapists and to couples who have 
divorced, it is an issue that comes up.

<p>

The question in a marriage is, What is first 
priority?  If the answer is your kids, that can cause some 
problems, but they are both of your kids, so that can be an 
acceptable answer.  If the answer is my job is more 
important than you are, your marriage is in trouble.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So you were talking -- one of the 
things I like about your book is, after it sort of outlines 
a very shaky foundation our society rests on because 
marriage is so stressed by kind of a divorce mentality, you 
are saying, Look, there are some answers.  So how can people 
build a lasting love, or what could society do?

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Well, you know, we have to change, 
as I say -- these things did not happen in a vacuum, and we 
have been talking a lot about some of the cultural changes 
and the changes in our ideas of marriage and love and the 
kind of commitment we need to make, and all those are very 
important.

<p>

But something else happened, too, Kristi.  Around 
1970, our government became, for reasons that are difficult 
to fathom, very hostile to marriage as an institution, and 
in a lot of ways, people -- if you go back, there is no one 
saying, "Oh, I want to undermine marriage; I'll do this."  
But a whole series of changes came, passed through our -- 
which have really, I think, been very hostile to marriage.  
They range from, for example, the shift to unilateral no-fault 
divorce.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So the laws became a problem.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Which is responsible for -- maybe 
as much as 25 percent of the increase in divorce rates came 
from that change in the laws, which -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I am going to have to hear more 
about this in two seconds.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Okay.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: After this break, we will bring you 
more interesting revelations regarding marriage and its 
standing in today's society.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>, where we are trying to 
understand how our government has had an impact on divorce.

<p>

Maggie, you wrote about this really brilliantly in 
the book, and I certainly want to encourage people to buy 
the book and to read it.  But one of the problems that you 
are uncovering in terms of fixing the divorce problem was 
that some structures had gotten in the way of marriage.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Yes. The government has been very 
hostile.  You know, what unilateral no-fault did is really 
say we're not going to enforce the marriage contract 
anymore.  We're not going to let you get married.  When you 
get married, what are you doing?  Well, you're promising to 
live with someone until you feel like doing someone else.  
Well, guess what, Kristi?  That is rather like cohabitation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That is true.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: And one reason why I think 
cohabitation is on the rise is we have reduced marriage from 
a legal standpoint to where it is rather like living 
together with a license.

<p>

But there are a lot of ways government has drained money 
from families that is desperately needed.  Married couples 
are struggling.  They are not having children they want to 
have because they have to pay for subsidies to Amtrak and 
Dole Corporation, and it has been a very low priority, 
protecting family income.  That has had an effect.

<p>

And then we have rewarded in the form of welfare policies 
very destructive behavior, and I am particularly concerned 
with this whole issue of children having children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Then there are other things that people 
don't know about at all, which is, there are federal laws which 
have basically prevented local communities from enforcing 
basic moral standards.  If you, in your school, would like to 
deal with getting pregnant teens out of the classroom and put 
them in a special program and teach them what they need to 
teach and send the message that it is wrong to be 16 and 
having a baby out of wedlock, the reason you cannot do that 
is that the Federal Government has defined that as pregnancy 
discrimination, and you cannot have it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Astounding.

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Public housing used to give a 
strong preference to low-income married couple, very 
important support for marriage in the working class, and 
again, that was abolished because the Federal Government 
said that was discrimination on the basis of marital status.

<p>

So there is a lot of work to be done.  There are 
terrible cultural trends.  But a lot of them are, if not 
driven, at least being reinforced by the government, and 
they are frustrating the desire of ordinary Americans to 
have control over their homes, their families, their income, 
and their community life, and that has to change.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have about a minute left, Maggie, 
and I really appreciate your joining us today.  But what one 
or two things can you tell us in this brief amount of time 
about marriage to help people have success in their own 
marriages?

<p>

MS. GALLAGHER: Well, I guess what we really need 
-- people say we need to be less romantic.  But I don't 
believe that, Kristi.  I think we need to be more 
idealistic.  We need to recover a vision of marriage as 
being really heroic and extraordinary and worth making 
sacrifices for.  We need to say to people who are in the 
middle of troubles in their marriages that we think their 
struggles are valuable, that they are doing something 
important, and that we have faith for them when they don't 
have faith themselves that they can work their problems out 
and that the reward for doing so is worth waiting for, and 
that reward -- we are not trying to punish people; we are 
trying to help couples achieve their objective, which is a 
happy family.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is a phenomenal book.  I want to 
hold this up, <i>The Abolition of Marriage</i>.

<p>

Maggie, thank you so much for being with us, and I 
think you are right, you know, and I have to say for myself, 
marriage is the best thing that I have ever done, and I know 
you feel the same way about your family.

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we are going to share 
more information regarding issues affecting you and your 
family.  Stay tuned.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the
Family Research Council</i>. I am your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i> we are going to discuss so-called 
easy answers to pregnancy, sometimes called the morning 
after pill, emergency contraception, or RU-486.  It all 
sounds like a worry-free procedure when described by the 
activists who are pushing its approval by the Food and Drug 
Administration, but some disturbing facts about the 
complications of those drugs are beginning to come to light.
According to pro-life groups, this two drug abortion method
could lead to severe physical, emotional, psychological, and
legal troubles if it receives FDA approval.  So we will hear
from some experts about the possible complications of this
so-called simple solution.

<p>

But first, a preview of an innovative part of the 
upcoming Republican National Convention.  I spoke with Gus 
Pace, the RNC's Co-Director of Internet Services and FRC's
own Internet expert, Loralei Gilliam, about the
opportunities in Cyberspace for all of those who want to
participate in the convention from their own home. In fact,
FRC president, Gary Bauer, will be available during the 
convention for a cyberchat. Let's here more about this 
exciting opportunity as <i>Straight Talk</i> takes you Behind the 
Headlines.

<p>
<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you so much, Gus and Loralei,
for being with us today on Behind the Headlines. You all 
are involved in a very exciting and revolutionary new way in 
which people can get involved in the Republican Convention.
You know, for the most part people watching conventions were
very passive, watching it on television, reading about it in 
the newspaper, but the Internet has offered some very 
exciting new opportunities.

<p>

Gus, I know you have been working on that.  Can 
you tell us a little bit more about what is going to happen?

<p>

MR. PACE: Well, I think what we are doing with 
the Internet and what the Republican Party is doing with the 
Internet is very exciting right now.  You know, the term 
there that you used, passive, is a very key term.  Always 
before, our participation in political conventions and in 
political activities and in campaigns has been very passive.
We read what is in the newspaper.  We see what is on 
television, and that is it.

<p>

The Internet, I think, has revolutionized that.
It gives us the ability to actually participate -- two-way 
communication.  You know, you can email the platform 
committee this year for the first time.  You can participate 
in live chats with members of Congress and senators and 
governors and elected officials and delegates at the 
convention.  This is a complete new way for the American 
democracy to become involved in the electoral process like 
we have never seen before.

<p>

You know, in 1962, the debates that were televised 
revolutionized the electoral process.  In 1996, I think this 
is sort of the test drive year for the Internet. I think we 
will see a lot of participation on the Internet. It gives 
us the ability to put all of our information, provide all 
the press releases, provide all the speeches, complete on 
the Internet, and you as an active participant or a person 
wanting to participate in the electoral process, can call 
this up from your local computer.

<p>

It does not matter if you are in a small town or 
in a large city or at a public library or at a friend's
house.  You can call up the home page.  You can read the 
speech for yourself.  You are not reading a two-paragraph 
clip that someone else has put together.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: No middle man.

<p>

MR. PACE: No middle man. So I find that very 
exciting.  I mean, I believe that when our message is out 
there and when people see our message complete that we have 
a good message, and it will sell itself.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Loralei, for those people who are 
watching our program and are not familiar with the Internet, 
how would they find this exciting opportunity and the Family 
Research Council connection?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: The best way that I would suggest is 
to participate in FRC's home page.  By accessing our home 
page, we will have what is called a hot link that will link 
our page directly to the convention site.  So that way they 
are able to get FRC's input from the convention, in addition 
to looking at our news releases on what is going on at the 
convention, but at the same time linking to the convention 
site and seeing directly what is going on there.

<p>

The convention site is very innovative in what 
they are able to do with live footage.  You can actually 
click in and see exactly what is going on on the convention 
floor.  From my understanding, this is the first time that 
this has ever happened.  This is going to be real exciting 
for folks to be able to click in and then go into a chat 
room and talk with folks in California, Texas, Missouri, and 
be able to talk about what is going on and see if they are 
in agreement and turn around and use that input and send 
emails to their members or send emails to the platform and 
put their input in on the convention.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gus, I know you have been working 
very long and hard hours developing a lot of things for 
people to enjoy and connect with.  Could you tell us a 
little bit more about what is going to be available?

<p>

MR. PACE: Sure, if I could just follow up a 
little bit with what Loralei said about the Family Research 
Council being a key component, and your home page is a key 
component.  You know, we have designed a very unique 
interactive home page that will exist during the two weeks 
of the convention.  It will be unveiled on the fifth, the 
day the platform discussions take place.  It will be active 
and continue through the entire convention.  The chat rooms 
will all be up and live during the platform.  You will have 
the ability to participate in platform discussions.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And there are going to be some news 
makers participating in that.

<p>

MR. PACE: We will have some news makers scheduled 
during the evening to chat live with you, answer your 
questions.  I will give an example of on Tuesday night the 
state of Missouri has organized a Missouri Night on the 
Internet, and as part of their grass roots organization, the 
local clubs are being encouraged to host their own 
convention parties where they invite their friends in.

<p>

You know, everyone does not have Internet access.
I mean, as I mentioned, this is the test drive year.  So 
they are being asked to invite their friends in or go to a 
library or a public place where there is Internet access, 
and they will have the ability to chat with all the Missouri 
elected officials that are at the convention.  They are all 
going to be on-line for an hour-and-a-half, and this is just 
one example.  There are other states that are doing that, 
also.

<p>

I know that your group, for example, several of 
your members may decide that there is one night that they 
want to have friends over and participate in the convention.
This is something that has never happened before.  To get 
groups together before, you called them around the kitchen 
table, you opened up the newspaper, you read the newspaper, 
and then you discussed what was printed in the newspaper.
This gives you the ability to click on one icon on the home 
page and watch the podium live, like you are on your 
television, or if you do not have that software, you can 
click on another icon and get the printed textual update.  
Then if you want to go into a live chat room and ask some 
questions of your elected officials, you have the ability to 
do that all at one time.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So, Gus, to ask a quick question, 
Gus, are you all working with the Internet site going to be 
monitoring the input and the email to pass along to Haley 
Barbour and the GOP leaders what people are saying?

<p>

MR. PACE: Yes, we will.  We will have a 
continuous content update.  As quick as a speech is given 
from the floor, it will be updated to the home page.  There 
are a couple of really neat things.  Haley will be calling 
in and providing an audio update to the RNC home page about 
once an hour, just sort of a this is what is taking place.  
The week of the platforms, all official platform positions 
will be updated immediately.

<p>

So people will have the access to that 
information.  They can read the complete platform.  They can 
read the complete speech that was given.  They will know who 
is on the platform talking right then.  You are not relying 
on a news anchor or someone else sort of to give you a 
synopsis of what is taking place.  You get the complete 
picture as it is occurring, or you can go back and see what 
was said yesterday.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: A wonderful opportunity like this 
that has opened two-way communication is, of course, going 
to open the GOP up in the convention to hearing some 
critical voices and some people who have different kinds of 
opinions.  How are you guys prepared to deal with that kind 
of feedback?

<p>

MR. PACE: Well, you know, our founding fathers 
wrote of a truly informed and participatory democracy.  I 
mean, I think the Internet gives us the ability to do that.  
I am sure there will be some people that will participate 
that will probably express opinions that are a little 
contrary, but our biggest advantage is an informed 
electorate, and I think that once the electorate sees our 
message complete and reads it that they will see we do have 
the best message.  You know, we are not relying on small 
clips of a message.  We have a complete package here.  We 
have a complete party and a complete package.

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: I think that is one of the most 
exciting things for our constituents, because so many times 
they feel that they are not able to get all of the 
information, that they are restricted to the media that 
tends to give a liberal bias to the information that is out 
there.

<p>

This way they are able to actually see word-for-word what is 
happening and what is said, and then they can 
make their own informed decision about what was spoken, and 
they are able to participate and get involved, and that was 
part of what was so exciting in 1994 was the grass roots 
actually were able to make a difference, and this is going 
to give them the tools to continue to be involved in 
politics.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: If you are sitting down at the 
computer and you are going to pull up some kind of search 
engine, what kind of words could I type in to get to the 
convention or to FRC's site?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: For FRC's site, it would be www.frc.org.  Easy.

<p>

MR. PACE: And you can go straight from the FRC 
site to the RNC site.  There will be a hot link.  But I 
would encourage everyone to participate.  I mean, we have 
developed what I consider is a phenomenal on-line presence 
this year.  The thing that will make it successful is if 
people come and participate.  Never before have they had the 
opportunity, and we have given them the opportunity this 
year. So I encourage everyone to participate.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to be highlighting this 
exciting opportunity on the program and supering it 
throughout, because we want people to make this important 
connection.  Is there anything else you can add so that our 
viewers can really get something different out of this 
special convention?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM:  Well, this allows our constituents 
to get involved, and I think this is very important for them.

<p>

MR. PACE: And I would just say come join us in San Diego.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you so much, both Gus and Loralei, for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will begin our 
discussion about RU-486, the most vogue method of abortion 
today:  how simple is it?

<p>

Please stay tuned to find out.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[Videotape of National Right to Life Conference follows.]

<p>

DR. GLASOW: The RU-486 site-detect prostaglandin 
technique is the first first-trimester chemical abortion 
method to seek licensing in the United States and is the 
first chemical abortion method of any kind to be seeking 
licensure in over 20 years.  Dr. David Kessler, the 
Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, President 
Clinton's appointee to that position, has put this RU-486 
abortion method on a record-breaking fast track approval for 
U.S. marketing.  The licensing application was filed a mere 
4 months ago, and Kessler promised that the whole process 
would only take 6 months, which is about one-third of the 17 
months that fast track drugs usually take.

<p>

Based on our concern for both the mother and her 
child, tomorrow we will testify before the only public 
hearing that will be held before the FDA makes its final 
decision on approval.  RU-486 is not a contraceptive or a 
morning after pill and is being licensed only for abortion.

<p>

DR. HARRISON: Proponents of chemical abortion 
claim this is almost a swallow a pill and poof, the 
pregnancy disappears. This is pure medical fantasy.
Chemical abortion requires a four to six step procedure 
taking place over weeks.  The woman has not one but two 
drugs to take on two separate occasions, requiring at least 
three separate pelvic exams until the woman finally passes 
the fetus, and she may pass the fetus any time any place 
over those two weeks.

<p>

DR. FRANZ: RU-486 abortions are marketed as 
providing benefits over surgical abortions because they are 
supposed to be private, patient-controlled experiences that 
are somehow more natural.  These characteristics may 
actually predispose the woman to having greater 
psychological problems.  It is possible for the woman to be 
alone at home when she aborts.  Since it is important that 
she identify the contents of her womb, she must look at the 
results of the abortion.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The facts regarding RU-486 are more 
disturbing than many would like the public to believe, so 
tonight we have some special guests to present the rest of 
the story.  I would like to introduce you to Olivia Gans, 
who is head of American Victims of Abortion, a long-time 
Washington activist, and also Gracie Hsu, a policy analyst 
with the Family Research Council, who has worked extensively 
on the RU-486 issue and shares with us some of her findings 
tonight. Thank you both for being with us.

<p>

I would like to start first with Gracie, and I 
know, Olivia, you have been working on this issue at 
National Right to Life for quite a while, but the thing that 
we always hear about chemical abortion is that this will be 
a simpler process.

<p>

We have this surgical procedure in which you go 
and have the baby taken out by a vacuum suction method or a 
new thing, partial birth abortion, some extraction 
techniques at the end of abortion, but is a chemical 
abortion -- first of all, let's take their claims -- simple?

<p>

MS. HSU: No, it is not. As you know, a surgical 
abortion requires maybe a 15 to 30-minute procedure, and it 
is a surgical procedure.  So there is not bleeding 
prolonged.  But when you talk about RU-486, there is 
actually a lot of prolonged bleeding, and this is a 
procedure that takes over the course of 2 weeks to 30 days, 
and you have to go into the doctor's office the first day to 
be administered the drug, two days later to receive a 
prostaglandin, which actually induces labor.

<p>

So you are actually going through the process of 
labor, and because it is a poison -- it is a hormonal change 
in your body -- your body reacts pretty violently, and so 
there is a lot of nausea and vomiting and a lot of bleeding 
involved, and in fact, we know that many women have had to 
seek hospitalization, narcotics for pain killers.  Some have 
even had to undergo transfusions because of the hemorrhaging.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One thing I found startling -- I 
thought I was pretty informed about this -- but when I was 
reading up for the show, that anti-inflammatory drugs like 
Advil or Aleve or some of the typical ibuprofen kind of 
drugs, you know, like a woman in that kind of pain who might 
take an Advil, that is actually a bad decision, that there 
are counterindications for all kinds of drugs that a woman 
in that kind of pain might even take on her own.  What are 
the dangers of some of these drugs?

<p>

MS. HSU: Well, I cannot speak to the narcotics --

<p>

MS. GANS: Well, there are different 
complications.  We do know that certain types of drugs like 
the ones you have mentioned can increase bleeding, can 
increase other complications.  The drugs are synthetic 
drugs, after all.  They are very powerful synthetic drugs.  
They are being introduced into an otherwise healthy and 
normal condition of female bodies -- that is, pregnancy.  
Pregnancy is not a disease.  There is nothing abnormal about 
a female body being pregnant.  It might be uncomfortable at 
certain times, but it is not abnormal, and it certainly is 
not a disease.

<p>

So you have these two powerful synthetic drugs 
being introduced into a healthy body.  Then you are asking 
perhaps for other interactions from different types of 
drugs.  If she does, for instance, use narcotics to try to 
numb the pain or to stem the bleeding, all kinds of further 
complications, because you are not then talking about one or 
two drugs, but maybe three or four different drugs, all 
going into an otherwise healthy body.  There is just no 
sanity in that, and it makes no logical sense to people on 
both sides of the issue to insist that this is a reasonable 
and logical course of action.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I want to ask more about that later, 
because what is interesting about RU-486 and the morning 
after pill is you see feminists and actually pro-abortion 
advocates saying, look, I am concerned about this chemical.

<p>

But Olivia, you understand abortion from a 
personal angle, as well. Can you tell us a little bit about 
your experience?

<p>

MS. GANS: Well, I am a mother of an aborted 
child. I did have an abortion in 1981, and I am very 
conscious of the ramifications of making that decision and 
also the dynamics that go into finding a woman in the 
position where she would even consider abortion a reasonable 
thing to do. I have also been working for 15 years now in 
the pro-life movement, for 10 of those years as the director 
of American Victims of Abortion, and I have worked with 14 
countries outside the United States, where I have had the 
opportunity to listen to other women like myself who have 
experienced surgical abortions and who recognize that 
abortion is always an act of violence committed against 
unborn children and their mothers, that both of us are 
harmed.  Our children lose their lives, and we may lose our 
lives, and here now we are talking about another effort on 
the part of abortion providers to expand the number of 
abortions being performed, to come up with yet another way 
to destroy our children, and leave women without the real 
life-affirming options that they seek.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What do you think from your 
experience and from working with women overseas, and 
obviously a lot of the RU-486 and chemical things have taken 
place in France and testing there, and other countries have 
been more aggressive in pursuing it.  How do you think women 
are psychological going to react to a surgical procedure 
versus something that could take a month, a month of 
bleeding, a month of pain, a month of doctors' visits? What 
is your assessment to date of the psychological trauma that 
that could give a woman?

<p>

MS. GANS: Well, unfortunately, as with all post-abortion 
syndrome complications, there has not been enough 
significant research, and what is present is anecdotal at 
best.  Now anecdotal research is valuable, because it sets 
the criteria for statistical research, but the evidence is 
pointing to serious trauma, the most powerful part of the 
trauma coming from the mother of this child actually having 
to identify the unborn child that she has passed and making 
sure that she has in fact passed her baby, that the baby has 
not remained inside, and she has simply experienced 
hemorrhaging.

<p>

She must, therefore, look at the result of having 
taken this drug with her own hand, and for many 
psychologists who work in the area of post-abortion 
syndrome, it is that dynamic, asking this woman to take with 
her own hand the drugs that are intended to kill her unborn 
child and then to identify that in fact her child is dead.  
That will be -- and I can tell you, as the mother of an 
aborted child, that will, in fact, I believe be the most 
profoundly affecting thing that occurs during the entire RU-486 
process.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, you do not really hear 
about that at all, Gracie.  You and I deal with this at 
Family Research Council, and we know that one of the biggest 
complications of this is if the child does not pass.  There 
can be infection.  There can be incredible bleeding, as the 
body attempts to follow through with the chemical process, 
but women must examine then everything.

<p>

MS. GANS: What they have been told is a product
of conception.  Remember that they have been told up to this
point you will be passing a clump of tissue, a lump type of
substance may pass from your body, and then what she sees is
what some people refer to as the teardrop baby.  Many people
may be familiar with the picture of a two-month-old child in
what is the shape of a teardrop, the amniotic sac, and there
inside is a perfectly formed tiny child whose eyes you can
see, whose tiny little developing hands are quite visible.
The spinal column is visible at that point.

<p>

All of these things can be seen if when she passes 
the amniotic sac it is more transparent than bloody, and 
that is what I believe is the height of cruelty to women to 
ask them to believe the unbelievable at that point.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gracie, this has been highly 
politicized by the FDA.  As we noted on the tape before, 
this has way been escalated beyond what we are looking at 
for other drugs.  Why are we looking at taking something not 
to deal with disease or injury?  Why are we escalating a 
chemical that causes an abortion when it is not as if there 
are not other abortion procedures available if that was what 
you wanted to choose?

<p>

MS. HSU: Well, that certainly is the question of 
the hour.  We know that President Clinton in one of his 
first acts of office removed the ban that would allow RU-486 
to be imported into the United States, and furthermore, Dr. 
David Kessler, who is the commissioner of the FDA, has also 
said on record in congressional hearings that he wants to 
see this put on a six-month fast track, and that, again, is 
purely political, and when we spoke to the population 
council on the day of the hearing itself, they said that the 
reason why they were pushing this, even with incomplete 
data, even with incomplete analysis of the U.S. clinical 
trial, they said that the reason why they are doing this now 
is because they want to do this before the presidential 
elections, because if on the small chance that President 
Clinton does not get reelected, then they will not have an 
advocate in the White House any more, and RU-486 would be 
dead in the water.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Astounding. We are going to have to 
hear more about this.  When we come back, we will hear more 
from our experts regarding RU-486 and the damaging effects 
it can have on children.  Please stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are back with more <i>Straight Talk
from the Family Research Council</i>, where we are continuing 
our discussion about RU-486.  We are joined by Dr. Camilla 
Hersh, an obstetrician and gynecologist who has worked on 
this issue, a long-time activist; Olivia Gans, director of 
American Victims of Abortion; and FRC policy analyst Gracie 
Hsu.  Welcome back, and welcome, Dr. Hersh.

<p>

DR. HERSH: Thank you, Kristi.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, I have known you for a while 
now.  We were talking a little bit before about why this 
drug is coming quickly, kind of the political motivations, 
but one thing that has been problematic in the discussion is 
that as it is being discussed as so simple, and they are 
doing it in France, so why can't we do it here?  But what 
would be different about the way it is being discussed in 
application here than France?

<p>

DR. HERSH: Well, Kristi, I am really concerned 
about that, because, for one thing, in the French trials the 
whole procedure was very, very strictly controlled.  Each 
patient had to be registered by name, her address, where to 
find her, and France, compared to our country, is a 
relatively small place, and I have a lot of concerns about 
compliance in any trials or the release of this, the 
potential release of this terrible medication in our 
country.  We are a much bigger place.  We already have a 
much bigger problem with compliance.

<p>

One of the things that my patients often say to me 
when they describe their abortion experience is that halfway 
through, they really wish they could have changed their 
mind. They asked the doctor to stop.  They pleaded to stop.
But of course, things were so far along they could not stop, 
and I do not think it takes too much imagination to realize 
that once a woman takes the handful of drugs that they give 
her at the first visit and then she leaves, a lot of those 
women are not going to come back.  They are going to get on 
the plane and go back to Kansas City and see if Mom and Dad 
can help them out.  They are not going to complete the 
process.  We are going to have a large number of children 
deformed by this horrible drug.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What are some of the deformities 
that can take place?  I have read a vast amount of 
information about complications, but what first and foremost 
are the complications to any children that might result, and 
then what are other complications for the woman?

<p>

DR. HERSH: Well, of course, Kristi, it depends on 
what week in pregnancy the woman takes this medicine.  A lot 
of major organs are under formation at that point.  At the 
very end of the time that would be allowed to be given, the 
heart has been beating for three weeks, the little fingers 
are formed, but a couple weeks earlier, the midline facial 
features are coming together as the baby is being formed in 
the uterus.  Children that have been born that have had 
similar medications given at that point in pregnancy are 
missing limbs, missing the completion of their fingers, 
missing -- midline facial defects would be more common.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Like cleft palates?

<p>

DR. HERSH: Cleft palate, cleft lip, where the 
nose does not come all the way together in the center,
holopresencephaly[?] -- that is a long word for those
things.  And frankly, no one really knows, because there of 
course are not any studies where you could ethically test 
medicines that act at this point in pregnancy.  You just 
have to anticipate from the organs that are forming, and 
every two or three days, something major during that time in 
pregnancy is being formed.  All of our major organs are 
formed and in place by eight weeks from the last menstrual
period.  So it is a very critical time.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gracie, what has been the response 
of the Clinton administration and the FDA when groups like 
yours and Olivia's say we do not know enough about what is 
going to happen in RU-486, and frankly, we are pretty sure 
that American women are not going to comply as French women 
have?

<p>

MS. HSU: Yes, that was the most interesting 
result of this hearing.  A lot of the doctors on the 
committee did make reservations, and they did say we do not 
have complete U.S. data, we do not have all the information 
that we need, especially when it comes to compliance in the 
inner city and the low-income people who may be taking this 
drug and who may even be targeted because of this drug, but 
interestingly enough, they chose to gloss over it.  The 
chairperson of the group said, okay, with these reservations 
then, let's take these serious reservation under 
consideration, and let's vote anyway.  It was silly.  I 
mean, I think everybody who was in the audience, especially 
the press, could see that there were some major questions 
that were left unanswered but that they chose to continue in 
this process because they really wanted to get this through 
the FDA as soon as possible.

<p>

MS. GANS: If I may interject at this point, with 
relationship to what we know and don't know about RU-486, 
and I am sure Dr. Hersh can amplify this, but one of the 
things that is completely unknown really is the long-term 
effect on different population groups, which often have 
different health needs, different circumstances, dealing 
with their own biology because of different ethnicity 
sometimes, different issues. To say that we know what we 
need to know based on the experience of France or Sweden or 
Great Britain is completely erroneous, because one of the 
population groups, for instance, which has to be seriously 
considered separately from the general population are Native 
American women, and to my knowledge, there is a very small 
number of Native Americans living in Sweden.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

So it is incredibly scandalous, actually, that the 
FDA would suggest that we know what we need to know about 
this non-homogeneous population, which is the United States 
population, and we can go ahead and unleash this into an 
unsuspecting female population.

<p>

DR. HERSH: It is really a mockery of the 
standards that we expect to be in place to protect us as 
women in this country.  There are a number of population 
groups that are at greater, incredibly greater risk of 
complication with RU-486.  You mentioned Native Americans.  
African Americans, Asian Americans, and again, what portion 
of the populations of France and Sweden have any significant 
number of those individuals?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What percentage of the women in some 
of the testing had to have a surgical abortion because the 
follow-up showed that the abortion had not been completed 
with the chemicals?

<p>

DR. HERSH: Well, it varies. Depending on which 
of the studies you look at, anywhere from 2 to 13 percent.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And that is in a very controlled 
setting with a doctor checking you and with them being very 
able to ascertain that.

<p>

MS. GANS: But take that to its nth degree.  Two 
percent of what could be as many as 300,000 RU-486 abortions 
a year is upwards of 20,000 women requiring surgical 
abortions per year.

<p>

DR. HERSH: And that does not factor in that you 
can guarantee a certain percentage of women are not going to 
even comply to the point of coming for that second 
appointment. It is really frightening that the FDA can just 
gloss over. Imagine if our FDA had glossed over the 
complications, say, of thalidomide, which was a medicine 
used for nausea.  It was a wonderful medicine for nausea and 
pregnancy.  It was released in France and in Europe with a 
very minimal amount of testing, and there is a whole 
generation of thalidomide affected individuals who have no 
arms, have no legs. They are mentally intelligent, healthy 
people, but without any limbs it is hard to get along.

<p.

Our population was saved from that disaster 
because the FDA did not approve it.  There were not 
sufficient studies for use in pregnancy, and when there is 
something that is going to be used in such large numbers in 
this country, it is going to have tremendous repercussions, 
and who is going to bear the emotional, the financial -- 
name your risk.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to ask more 
about that in a moment.  Please stay tuned for more facts 
surrounding the newest in abortion methods, RU-486, when 
<i>Straight Talk</i> returns.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>. I would like to welcome once 
again our experts who are discussing the most recent pro-life 
battle, RU-486.  With us are Dr. Camilla Hersh, Olivia 
Gans, and Gracie Hsu.  Welcome back.

<p>

Gracie, one of the things that kind of is an 
interesting counter-melody to this entire discordant 
discussion about RU-486 is there have been a lot of people 
saying, look, we really do need to reform the federal Food 
and Drug Administration; the FDA has been too slow; we have 
not done enough for high risk people with AIDS and cancer.
So maybe the speeding up of RU-486 is a good thing, because 
it shows that the FDA is being more sensitive.

<p>

MS. HSU: Well, obviously not. It has shown that 
their priorities are all out of whack.  If you consider 
something like an AIDS patient or a cancer patient who has 
no other option and an experimental drug could do some good, 
the FDA should put that on a fast track.  The FDA should see 
that that gets first priority, not an abortion drug that has 
not cleared its final testing in the United States, that has 
not cleared a lot of the standards that the FDA normally 
recommends.

<p>

But beyond that, I think it is interesting that 
Congress right now is putting forward an FDA reform bill 
that would speed up the process for a lot of these life 
saving drugs, and this obviously is not -- RU-486 is not a 
life saving drug by any means.  Not only is it harmful for 
the child in question, but it is also harmful for the 
mother.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And in fact, there is a lot of -- 
one of the things that I have not read anything about except 
in pro-life literature is that some women would really be at 
high risk to take that.  It is not a one size fits all drug.  
What are some of the risk factors for women that would say, 
look, you in particular should not use this drug.

<p>

DR. HERSH: Kristi, there are several risk factors 
that are actually pretty ordinary.  Anyone who has asthma.  
Now a lot of people who have asthma do not think they have 
asthma.  They call themselves exercise wheezing or wheezing 
when they have allergies or wheezing when they have a cold, 
but in fact, they have low-level asthma.  Women who have 
asthma are at great risk for exacerbations of their asthma 
and cardiac arrest with these kinds of drugs.

<p>

Women who have recently taken anti-prostaglandins, 
which you think, well, I do not take any anti-prostaglandins, 
but how many times in the last week have you 
taken an Advil, a Nuprin, an Aleve.  Hello!

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

That makes you at increased risk for hemorrhage 
afterwards.  Anyone who has had uterine surgery, a recent 
cesarean section, anyone who has a history of ectopic 
pregnancy, anyone who has a history of pelvic infection, 
anyone who has a history of uterine fibroids.  Probably half 
of women by the time they reach age 40 have at least one 
fibroid.

<p>

The list goes on. Those are pretty common things 
for women to have. Women of Asian ancestry have a much 
higher risk of hemorrhage afterward.  There is no logical 
explanation for that; it needs to be studied, but they pick 
up a higher incidence of that.  One of the reasons that 
women of Native American descent have a higher problem is 
that they often have undiagnosed diabetes. Women with 
diabetes have a much higher complication. Women who smoke.

<p>

So you put together someone who is nervous, she is 
bleeding and passing clots, she took the second dose of 
medicine.  She does not know what to do.  She usually 
wheezes with stress.  She is starting to wheeze.  She quit 
smoking three weeks ago, and so she wrote on the form that 
she is not a smoker, but really she just has to have a 
cigarette, and maybe if she just took some of those Advil in 
the closet she would feel better.  You put those things 
together, and that is not an unusual thing, that scenario 
that I just put together. That is a person who may have her 
complications coalesce into a death.

<p>

Another thing that is very scary to me is in the 
few studies that have been done in this country, it seems 
already that the complications are being swept under the 
carpet.  There is the woman in Iowa --

<p>

MS. GANS: Perhaps the most -- that is Dr. Lavier's[?] case?

<p>

DR. HERSH: Right, hemorrhaged.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Tell us about some of those complications.

<p>

MS. GANS:  Well, Camilla probably could explain it 
far better, but the simple story is that one of the women in 
the trials did begin to hemorrhage.  She lost a full half 
volume of her body content of blood before going to the 
emergency room.  The surgeon who was brought in was Dr. Mark 
Lavier, who was at the testimony the other day at the FDA 
hearing, and his concern was brought to the fore because 
shortly after treating this woman and saving her life -- she 
was on the verge of death when she was brought to the 
emergency room by her distraught husband -- he saved her 
life only to read in the papers just shortly thereafter the 
reports of Iowa Planned Parenthood that there were no 
complications in the Iowa trials.

<p>

DR. HERSH: When they were questioned, they said 
that complication was not outside the expected realm of 
complications.

<p>

MS. GANS: So death is expected.

<p>

DR. HERSH: Major hemorrhage requiring transfusion 
and near death is within the expected range of complication.  
As a woman, I find that frightening.  But that is not 
reported.  As a doctor, I find that frightening, that it is 
not reported as a complication.

<p>

MS. GANS: That is the most dangerous thing about 
the case with Lavier, as Dr. Hersh points out.  They tried 
to back up, once Dr. Lavier brought it to the presss 
attention.  There was no offer on their part to admit that 
there were complications.  It was only when Dr. Lavier 
brought it out and said wait a minute, you are telling half 
truths, because I treated one of the women who almost died 
in your trials.  Then they tried to back pedal and say that 
this was a reasonable complication which we can live with.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So death is a reasonable 
complication.  I mean, where are the women's rights
activists who are supposed to be champions of what is good 
for women?  I mean, we have lived through thalidomide.  We 
have lived through IUDs and the Dalkon shield and toxic 
shock and everything else. I mean, breast implants. You 
can't open a women's magazine without seeing a story on how 
horrible corporate America has been toward women.  Why 
aren't we worried about the implications of a drug like 
this?  Gracie, what are feminists saying?  Where are our so-called 
advocates on this?

<p>

MS. HSU: Well, they certainly are not on the side 
of women's health.  They are on the side of abortion and 
abortion alone. NARAL, NOW, all of these pro-feminist 
groups have come out saying that women want this drug, that 
women want to abort their children this way, and that this 
is a good thing, and unfortunately they have had to sweep 
aside the data, because the data clearly show that there are 
so many questions, so many complications that will occur.

<p>

DR. HERSH: And there is no information whatsoever 
about long-term complications from this drug.  If you simply 
look at the organ systems that this drug affects -- a 
person's uterus, her fertility -- what happens to someone 
who has maybe two of these kind of abortions within a 6-month 
period?

<p>

If you think about it, 40 percent or so of all 
abortions are repeat abortions.  What if someone uses this, 
as many people use with abortion, as basically a family 
planning method?  What happens when this builds up in your 
system?  What happens to your breast tissue?  The breast 
tissue is also in an incredible growing phase during early 
pregnancy, and this drug is going to act on the progesterone 
receptors in the breast tissue.

<p>

What is going to be the impact on breast cancer?
There are already some clues with other studies that the 
risk of breast cancer may be increased with just an ordinary 
-- if you can call any abortion ordinary -- surgical 
abortion.  What happens to the rest of our bodies? What 
happens to the fat storage where medicines build up? What 
happens to your risk of other long-term malignancies? There 
is no study.  There is not even any animal data on long-term 
complications.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, I am sure the animal rights would be better 
organized than women.

<p>

DR. HERSH: You can just count on it.

<p>

MS. GANS: Well, I think the bottom line here is 
who is organized on this issue are the pro-abortionists.
The abortion agenda is highly organized, totally mobilized 
on this front, and as we have said already, Bill Clinton's
agenda is part and parcel of their agenda. Probably the
only promises Bill Clinton has not broken are his promises 
to the abortion lobbying groups, and here we see the end 
result of that.

<p>

Bottom line here, what the abortion providers want
to see are more physicians performing abortions. They are
upset that doctors are getting out of the abortion business.
They want to see abortionists increased. They do not care 
at the end of the day whether women's lives are hanging in 
the balance, and they certainly do not care that their 
unborn children are dying.  So for many of these groups, as 
was stated at the trials, it was admitted that more 
physicians would perform abortions if this drug was 
available.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Astounding.

<p>

After this break, <i>Straight Talk</i> continues our 
discussion of RU-486.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We are wrapping up our 
discussion of RU-486 with tonight's special guests, Dr. 
Camilla Hersh, Olivia Gans, and Gracie Hsu.

<p>

Olivia, I would like to ask you, working with the 
National Right to Life and certainly being long-term in this 
particular field, one of the success stories has been fewer 
and fewer physicians being willing to participate in 
abortion.  RU-486 kind of deals with that.  How does that 
work together?

<p>

MS. GANS: Well, let's understand why doctors 
don't want to be abortionists. Doctors do not want to be 
abortionists because they recognize that there are two 
people involved in every abortion decision, the mother and 
her unborn child, and of course, with the advent of all of 
what we know from ultrasound technology, the science of 
fetology, these doctors are now able to actually treat in 
the most minute ways this second patient, and suddenly now 
you are seeing young physicians, and older physicians, 
saying no, we will not be a part of this violent horrible 
act.  This is not why I became a doctor.  So these 
individuals are dropping out like flies, and thank Heavens 
they are.  They are not staying in the abortion business.

<p>

But the increase in RU-486 abortions precedes for 
some people what has been a problem with actually having to 
participate in a hands-on way killing the second patient.  
So the abortion providers presume that if the doctors do not 
actually have to lay hands on the second patient, more of 
them will become abortionists.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: They would be willing to write a 
prescription and do what they would not do with their own 
hand.

<p>

MS. HSU: Data actually shows, for polling data, 
that a greater number of family practitioners and not 
surgical abortionists would choose to use RU-486, but beyond 
that, it is interesting, because family practitioners do not 
have necessarily the medical knowledge and the training to 
undertake the complications of an RU-486 that does not 
result in a complete abortion.  So what has happened is that 
the population council said in the testimony itself, oh, it 
is okay.  Any doctor, any medical student, is trained to do 
the gestational age, to do complications of pregnancy, and 
every single committee member shook their head and said no, 
you have to be trained to do surgical abortions.

<p>

DR. HERSH: It does bring up a different kind of 
compliance problem.  We have talked some about the 
compliance problem of the patient who changes her mind or 
doesn't follow the directions or doesn't come back, but the 
compliance of the abortionist, the chemical abortionist, if 
you will, is that unless you are experienced in the use of a 
particular procedure or a protocol, the chance of mistakes 
is going to be very high -- giving the wrong amount of 
medication, giving it at the wrong time, diagnosing how far 
along in the pregnancy the woman is, knowing how to follow 
basically the management of an intentional induced 
miscarriage, whether the woman has passed all the parts of 
the baby, whether she is developing an infection afterward, 
how much bleeding is a normal amount of bleeding, how much 
bleeding is a non-normal amount of bleeding.

<p>

If you did then need to do a surgical abortion 
after a partial abortion, whether it is spontaneous or 
induced, the uterus is a much more fragile organ at that 
time, the chance of perforation and further damage, 
lacerating the cervix.  I could probably go on and on, but 
you are right.  There is much more chance of basically 
medical malcompliance as you have fewer trained people 
following the patient carefully.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Sure. You even have the abortion 
advocates almost bragging that you could have nurses or 
physicians assistants involved.  We can cut the doctor out 
totally.

<p>

MS. GANS: Well, you have to look at what has 
happened to those of us that have had abortions.  Since 
abortion was legalized, we have seen the casual disregard of 
the woman as patient, let alone -- obviously the baby is 
invisible, completely irrelevant in this experience, but now 
women are --

<p>

DR. HERSH: But these babies will not be so 
invisible.  We are going to see thousands and thousands of 
birth defects entering our society as a result of 
incompleted chemical abortions.

<p>

MS. GANS: The only thing I would say is that in 
fact they are claiming that doctors will have more attention 
to their patients and more understanding, and they cannot 
possibly, because as women have been treated more and more 
like cardboard objects on the table, as the abortionist 
kills their children, and the assembly line of the abortion 
industry has continued, this is just another way to speed up 
the assembly line process and to once again remove all 
connection and all responsibility for the decision that is 
actually being made.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gracie, we have about 20 seconds 
left. This could come up quickly. Tell me how quickly.

<p>

MS. HSU: We can see this within the next 2 months 
perhaps. The full agency of the FDA will come out in favor 
of recommending this for marketing in the United States.
One of the most problematic things is that the one
manufacturer that is going to do this, this RU-486, is 
called Advances in Health Technologies.  They are a brand-new 
corporation.  We do not know whether they are going to 
be manufacturing here or overseas, and they do not have any 
assets.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to get phone 
numbers, and we are going to invite our -- thank you to my 
guests, and I certainly hope people will call, and when 
<i>Straight Talk</i> returns, you will hear how you can receive 
more information regarding the issues affecting you and your 
family. Stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.  Tonight, <i>Straight 
Talk</i> is looking at the industry behind the get-rich-quick fantasy,
gambling.  It reaches farther than most of us are aware, touching
many lives, and it leaves behind not a trail of sparkling lights
and wealthy patrons but the darker side of our culture:  crime,
broken dreams, and dying economies.
<p>
Stayed tuned for the insights of those fighting this billion-dollar business. 
You may be surprised by what happens to those cities and states that embrace 
the dream that gambling offers.
<p>
But first, let's hear from Marty Dannenfelser, who spearheads FRC's 
government relations strategy.  After years of working on the Hill, Marty's 
contact list reads like a who's who of those congressional leaders who are 
changing government as we know it.
<p>
In recent weeks, the battle for controlling the future direction of the 
American government has been fought over the budget. Join me as Marty 
Dannenfelser shares a perspective gleaned from the closed meeting 
rooms where tough negotiations have been taking place, Behind the Headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're talking about the budget today, and it's kind of 
interesting.  Lately, reports of the budget negotiation are a little bit 
like the weather.  You know, they are very vague and there's a large room 
for error.  And, day after day, we come in and see that there's a budget 
negotiation but nothing has been decided, and yet government continues. How 
is it possible for us to have no budget and yet have government?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, the Congress traditionally passes a budget
each year, but that budget is really only a blueprint.  What really
affects what gets spent is what is known as the appropriations
process, and if they do their job the way they are supposed to,
they should pass 13 appropriation bills every year that fund the
entire government.  Usually there's a few agencies in each bill
that are funded, like the Department of Health and Human Services,
Labor, and Education, for instance; three very big departments
are funded in one bill.  Department of State and others are funded
in other bills, foreign affairs in some other bills, and so on.
<p>
So those appropriation bills are generally moving forward.
A few of them have been vetoed by the President; two or three
of them have been stuck in Congress.  So when they don't pass,
they have kept many of the major services in those bills funded
by what is known as a continuing resolution, which is a bill that
allows funding to continue, usually at a lower level than what
it would otherwise be funded at through the appropriation bills,
usually the lower of what either house has passed or last year's
level, whichever is lower.  But they can construct that however
they choose.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So then we have the budget, which is sort of a blueprint 
of what it is that we can spend; and then we have appropriations bills, 
which are kind of like checks that we write out; and then a continuing 
resolution, which authorizes spending at last year's levels?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: For the most part. There have been a number of programs 
that the House, in particular, has voted to zero out that are still being 
funded at 75 percent of last year's levels.  Now, that may be about to
change, because the House in particular and Congress in general
are now talking very seriously about targeted appropriations,
which I think is a very good idea, to get the President's attention
in the overall budget negotiations, that things like Americorps
will be zero-funded.  The idea of paying volunteers just should
not be done.  It just does not make sense at a time when you've
got these huge deficits.  But that's one of the President's pet
programs, but I don't think the general public is clamoring for
the Federal Government to pay volunteers when there are millions
and millions of volunteers around the country doing things to
help people.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  A lot of the media is encouraging everybody
to hang tough, you know.  Don't compromise.  Let's take these
disagreements out on the campaign trail.  And we hear talk that
we could just continue funding the government with continuing
resolutions and then debate it all out during the election.  Is
that a good idea?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  No, not really.  I think that keeps things largely 
on automatic pilot.  I think one thing that the voters said in 1994 is 
they wanted change; they wanted things to be done differently.  And to 
continue largely the status quo would not be what the voters want.  So I 
think that they need to start getting more serious about the process.
<p>
One thing in terms of what you said about the budget.  If they want to 
make substantive changes in law -- for instance, the family tax relief
that we have been very strongly advocating -- they do need to
pass some separate bill so that can be part of a larger budget
package, what they call a budget reconciliation package.  And
we hear so much about entitlement spending.  If they want to do
anything to stop or reduce the level of automatic spending, they
need to pass a law to change it.  Otherwise, that automatic entitlement
spending will continue.
<p>
So that is why a budget reconciliation bill is important if you want to 
make those kinds of fundamental changes.  But the things that the people 
in Congress can control are the purse strings and the annual appropriations. 
That is where they can really control it if they stick to their guns.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So it seems that, every year, you have to fight the budget 
process two times:  one, to fight for the budget, which is the blueprint;
a second one to fight for the actual spending.  Is that the way
it works?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: Yes. You can pass what is called a budget resolution, 
which sets -- it is a blueprint. But in order to enforce those areas of 
agreement, you need what is known as a budget reconciliation bill, 
which actually changes the law in the important areas to effect those 
changes. Then you carry them out throughout the year through the appropriations 
process in terms of the spending levels.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Although the President and the Congress seem to be winning 
at different points, is there a danger that the public says, &quot;A pox 
on both your houses; we don't want anything to do with either of you in the 
next election&quot;?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, they have been getting pretty frustrated,
I think, with the people in Washington, both at the executive
level and the congressional level.
<p>
We have had the phenomenon for many years, though, of many people saying, 
well, they hate the Congress but they love their Congressman.  That changed 
a little bit in the last election cycle, but it would be a very
interesting question to see how it plays out in this year.
<p>
It is really a matter of framing the issues, because people overwhelmingly
want a balanced budget, but then again, the President senses there
are certain programs that they don't want to see cut, and in fact
what Congress is proposing does not cut some of those programs
but does in fact reduce the rate of growth in the programs, such
as Medicare and Medicaid.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So here we are having a little bit of fiscal constipation, 
you might say, and we wonder what is going to happen.  Could that energy 
be redirected so that we have a third party?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  Possibly, but I don't think the history of third 
parties in our country has been a very good one.  There have been a 
few that have been fairly competitive, but I think that most people 
sense that it is the two major parties that are most likely to elect 
their candidate, and ultimately, you have to impact those parties and 
get their attention.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Initially, the pollsters and the pundits said that 
President Clinton finally looked Presidential.  Now they think that 
Congress is doing a little better.  Is President Clinton the winner in
this budget debate?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  I think right now it has become more equalized. For 
a while, I think Clinton was winning. The Republicans let the debate get 
off of the big-picture argument about balancing the budget and into some 
of the specifics that Clinton wanted to talk about, Medicare and education 
and some of those types of things.
<p>
I think the tax relief issue, too, has not been emphasized enough, 
that families know that they are being squeezed, and one of the reasons 
they are being squeezed is by over-taxation.  So the idea of family tax 
relief needs to be promoted, that this is really part of the package, and 
they need to make that point more effectively.  There are some very
good charts that are put together that show how every state and
families in each state will benefit.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  About a week ago, President Bush gave an interview where he 
said that his one regret or miscalculation, you know, the biggest one that 
he had, was in deciding to go ahead and raise taxes after that &quot;Read
my lips:  No new taxes&quot; promise.
<p>
But Bill Clinton ran on middle-class tax relief.  The Republicans were 
very clear two years ago that they were here to fight for tax relief. 
Could they make a mistake, all of them, if they neglect pro-family tax
relief?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, I think there's a tendency sometimes
when people are in Washington for a while to start listening to
this inside-the-beltway chatter, particularly what you might call
the media elites.  And you're right; the media elites never like
tax relief, and they have no identification with family tax relief.
<p>
I just heard about one of the economically oriented groups that
did a focus group in Michigan, and one of the things that was
most clear was that the people wanted the tax relief, and I think
that people have seen that.  As you noted, President Bush and
some others have seen that, particularly when people have been
promised tax relief or that there would be no new taxes and then
the politicians went back on their word, they really do react
adversely to it.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  There are a lot of different budget items on the table. 
Who has more to lose if these promises aren't kept?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  I think the President has more to lose,
because he is much more visible to the country.  The members of
Congress have their individual constituencies.  They have a better
opportunity to talk one on one with their constituents and to
show them what they are doing.
<p>
So I think that the risk is really for the President, and if there is a 
down-turn in the economy, we could have something of a recession -- and 
we are starting to see a great deal of uncertainty in the stock market, 
and so on -- the President is the one who is going to be held accountable.
 He tends to  benefit from economic growth whether or not he is
responsible for it, but he also is the one that is held accountable
if things start to go downhill.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Marty, you are up on Capitol Hill every day, and it has been 
a tough year for the people up there.  They have worked practically through 
Christmas. They closed and opened on the same day the next session.  Tell
me, what is the mood up there on Capitol Hill?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, I think they are getting their breath a little bit. 
I think they worked really hard, you know, and an intense schedule
during the first year, and I think the fact that they have now
had a little bit of time to be with their families, to be back
home with their constituencies, I think some of them are going
to be refreshed, and I think you are going to see them come back
with a renewed aggressiveness, particularly with this targeted
appropriation strategy that I think is going to be the main focus
of particularly the House people.  They see that as the lever
to really get Clinton's attention in the overall budget negotiations.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So they have a renewed aggressiveness.  For what?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  For getting spending under control, basically
Congress saying, &quot;We're going to balance the budget, with
you or without you, and if you're not going to cooperate in a
larger budget agreement, then we are just going to target the
appropriations.  We are going to fund those things that the public
really wants and that we feel are important, but we are not going
to target the nonsense like Americorps paying volunteers and Goals
2000 to intrude on local education and things like that.
<p>
So I think once they start doing that and they let the President know
they are serious, he is going to have more of an incentive to
negotiate with them.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you very much for being with us, Marty. We 
appreciate your time.
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: Thank you. It was a pleasure.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Following this commercial break, we'll show you a side of 
the gambling industry you probably haven't seen and present a roundtable 
discussion with those who are fighting the billion-dollar business state 
by state. Please stay with us.
<p>

[Gambling segment.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Atlantic City and Las Vegas.  These cities invoke images and
sparkling lights, slot machines, poker tables, and money, money,
money.  In fact, these two cities for years have been the premier
meccas for those hoping to win the jackpot of their dreams.  Yet
currently 25 states are battling to get a piece of the action
by legalizing or expanding gambling in their own communities.
<p>
The gambling industry promotes itself as pure entertainment, as
well as a provider of economic development and tax revenue increases.
It may all sound like merely fun and games, but studies indicate
the contrary.  Each year, Americans lose more than $35 billion
in gambling.  Low-income families spend five to ten times more
on lottery tickets per capita than middle-income homes.  And among
those who bought the tickets, few were winners.  They lost three
times as much to gambling than those in the upper income brackets.
Compulsive gamblers had an average gambling debt of $43,000,
and to pay for those debts, 85 percent have stolen from their
employers.
<p>
Personal debt and embezzling are not the only things
that follow the gambling industry.  For example, over and above
the monetary costs that individuals and cities suffer, Gulfport,
Mississippi, saw at least 200 percent increases in rape and robberies,
as well as drastic increases in burglary, larceny, and arson.
<p>
With all that in mind, is the thrill of the jackpot worth the
chilling consequences gambling brings to a community?
<p>
To answer that question and many others, in our next segment, <i>Straight 
Talk from the Family Research Council</i> presents a roundtable discussion
involving Family Policy Council leaders from several states battling
the gambling industry.  They are concerned about gambling's impact
on individuals and communities.  The Family Policy Councils work
to research key issues, such as gambling, and inform their states'
representatives and citizens of their findings, which touch the
lives of families, sometimes very negatively.
<p>
So please stay with us as we begin this engaging discussion.  You won't want 
to miss it.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back.  We are here with some of the leading experts 
on gambling, especially at the grassroots level.  They have been working on 
it for years, a very impressive roundup here at <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. But first I would like to introduce to you 
Larry Huff, who is Family Research Council Director of State and Local 
Affairs.
<p>
Larry, you have been working with these gentlemen and, I know,
have become an expert in your own right on gambling.  First, who
are we talking to today?
<p>
MR. HUFF:  Okay, Kristi.  This is Paul Scianna, president of the Missouri 
Family Policy Center. To my left is David Zanotti, president of the 
Roundtables of Ohio. Michael Geer is here beside you, president of the 
Pennsylvania Family Research Institute.  And beside Michael is Mr. Bill 
Brooks, president and executive director of the North Carolina Family
Policy Council.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thanks so much for being with us today. You all have come 
a long way, I know.
<p>
Frankly, though, just to start off, what's wrong with a few lottery 
tickets?  Why are you all upset by a little bit of gambling? It doesn't 
really hurt anybody, does it? Don't hit me.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
MR. HUFF:  Kristi, in short, I think the problem is that gambling in the 
long term has very negative impacts on two main fronts:  one, economically,
and two, socially.  And I think that is the problem that is being
borne out again and again in studies that we see, is that in spite
of all the projections that are made about the good things that
gambling will do for a community, the long-term impacts again
are very detrimental to the economics of a city and to the city's
social problems.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And is it to the economics of a city, or are you 
seeing it to the economics of the state?  Where is the breaking point? 
Does it stop at the border of the town that has brought gambling in, 
or does it spread out further? What are you all seeing?
<p>
MR. GEER:  I think it really spreads across the state.  But, you know, there 
was a late state senator from Pennsylvania, Alphonse Deal(?), who said that 
gambling takes the clothes off the backs of the children in his district and
the food off of their table.
<p>
So when we talk about economics, whether it is in city or a community or 
across the state, the real impact is on the very lives of children and of 
families in those communities; and as lawmakers in our state of Pennsylvania
who are considering the possible expansion of gambling, they have
to recognize that if they allow that, they are going to be taking
the clothes off of children's backs and the food off of their
tables.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: But how has that happened?
<p>
MR. GEER:  Well, it happens in a number of ways.  Number one, those who 
directly involve themselves in gambling, it is just not a winner's kind
of activity.  Gambling happens -- the reason why these businesses
exist is to take the money out of people's pockets.  So instead
of a husband or a wife or a father going down and spending their
money to buy food or to buy clothing for their family, they will
be spending it on a get-rich-quick idea, going down to a casino
or buying lottery tickets or whatever.
<p>
And it is proven time and time again, although there are some people who win, 
far and away, most people lose, and it can be an addictive behavior that 
will lose significant amounts of money and again take the money away
from them.
<p>
Additionally, then, it goes beyond that to take money out of other 
businesses in the community.  They call it economic development, but 
what has been shown in community after community where they do have legalized 
gambling -- casinos or riverboat casinos -- is that the other businesses in 
the community dry up. They go out of business, and that means jobs for 
people, and those jobs are lost, and again, those families go hungry.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, I am a former Pennsylvanian.  My parents are still
there.  There has been a lottery there for a long time, a lot
of corruption that we have seen time and time again.
<p>
MR. GEER: Sure.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  The balls injected with water or fluid. What
are some of you guys seeing?  I mean, it would seem like gambling
doesn't bring a clean sheet of money in; it brings a lot of dirty
money in with it.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI:  Well, Kristi, one of the most interesting arenas of 
corruption when it comes to gambling is political corruption. In fact, 
it is probably the most dominant and the least talked about form of 
corruption.
<p>
The casino industry has become a major political funding machine in the 
United States of America, and what they do is they use their influence once
they get into a state to then begin to manipulate the legislature
according to their own whims and wishes, which is very dangerous.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: How do they do that, though?
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: Political contributions, and that has been --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So legal manipulation.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI:  Absolutely, the legal manipulation. But what ends
up happening is situations like you have in Atlantic City, where
it starts legally, and then, the next thing you know, you have
a mayor being dragged off to prison because of the fact that it
gets illegal pretty quickly because of the influence peddling
that accompanies these large contributions.
<p>
But back to your earlier question. There are two basic themes about 
gambling, particularly about casinos, which is the rage right now, and 
that is, number one, casinos don't work.  I think everyone around the 
table agrees. They don't work as a means of economic development. And 
secondly, casinos cannibalize local economies.  They simply destroy 
human beings.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, some people would say, though, you
set up a casino, you get the tax revenue, you have people there
using the dry cleaners, shopping at the grocery store --
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: No, that's not true.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  -- and it doesn't bring business in?
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: No. Statistically, in fact, Robert Goodman, a professor from 
Massachusetts University, has a great new book out called <i>The Luck 
Business</i>, where he documents over 20 years of research.  Historically, 
this is the third wave of gambling in the United States.  And it helps, I 
think, to go back to a little bit of history.
<p>
Gambling has been here since the time that the boats first got here in the 
1600s. It had its first wave until about the Civil War, where the culture 
basically had enough of gambling and began to outlaw it at the state level.
<p>
The second wave began in 1931 when Bugsy Siegel succeeded in Nevada,
where he launched the first casino enterprise.  And it stayed
that way until 1976, with only one state in the Union having casinos.
Then in 1976, when Atlantic City came forward, this began the
third wave, which we are in the heart of.
<p>
After 20 years of experience from 1976 until 1996, what we now have is 
enough documentation to find out that casinos don't create jobs.  They 
actually destroy jobs.  In Atlantic City, within 10 years of the time that 
casinos came, one-third of all the restaurants were out of business.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, why is that?
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI:  Because the casino is like a giant sponge.  It sucks up the 
revenue. It sucks up the local dollar.  It sucks up the family.  And it 
leaves nothing in its wake but destitution.
<p>
MR. GEER:  They compete with the local restaurants.  For example, many casinos 
use as a draw to get people into their establishment low-cost dinners or 
oftentimes free drinks or low-cost drinks, to the point where they are not
only -- I mean, they are competing with the local restaurants
for their own business as well as then cleaning out the wallets
of those people who come in there who have no money to spend anywhere
else.  They can't buy a shirt at a department store or go get
a cup of coffee at the local diner.
<p>
So it is not only in Atlantic City but in Mississippi, in Illinois, you see 
these restaurants drying up, and other establishments as well.
<p>
MR. HUFF: With the advent of legalized gambling in Atlantic City in the last 
25 years, they have gone from something like 2,100 businesses outside of
the gambling arena to like 1,100 businesses.  So we have about
reduced in half the number of businesses that are really putting
back into the economy instead of sucking out of the economy. 
Those legitimate business have been cut in half since gambling
came in in 1976.
<p>
MR. SCIANNA: You know, and Dave mentioned that gambling has been around since 
the boats got here. But I find it rather interesting that the Virginia House 
of Burgesses, which was the first representative body of the new world, among 
their first orders of business, they passed stern laws against gambling,
drunkenness, idleness, and immorality.  And so it has always been
here, and we are talking about the impact that it is having on
families.
<p>
The majority of Americans approve of some form of legalized gambling, 
but they don't want it in their own backyard. So if it's in some distant 
city like Las Vegas or Atlantic City, it's okay, but they really don't 
want it in their own backyard. And one of the reasons why is when you begin 
to increase the access to gambling, the folks who gamble the most -- 
statistics -- there is a U.S. Government study that shows that lower income
people lose, on the average, three times more as a percentage
of their income than do middle and upper class people.
<p>
So for a middle-class person who could afford to travel in years past
to Atlantic City or Las Vegas, their gambling money was discretionary
spending money.  For the folks who are gambling today and buying
lottery tickets -- which, again, lower income families buy five
to ten times more lottery tickets than middle-income families
-- for them, this is not discretionary spending money.  This is
just as likely to be food money, clothing money, their rent money,
or whatever.  And so you have a desperate person in an act of
desperation.  Once they lose this money, they only find themselves
in a more desperate state.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So it's a tax on the poor, basically.
<p>
MR. SCIANNA:  It is.  It is the most regressive tax on the poor in 
America's history.
<p>
MR. BROOKS: Yes, there are cases, studies, in Massachusetts, for example, 
in some of the poorest neighborhoods that show that families making less
than $10,000 a year are buying more than $2,000 a year in lottery
tickets.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Astounding.
<p>
MR. BROOKS:  So it's a very regressive tax. And, also, back to the point 
that there's only a certain amount of money in circulation in an economy. 
A good example of what Michael Geer was talking about is, down in Virginia,
a border state to North Carolina, where they put the lottery into
effect back in 1988, the retail markets in the southeastern corner
of Virginia, down in Virginia Beach and all that area, which is
a pretty large area, over a million people, the retail merchants
saw their sales just plummet.
<p>
So they asked their local Economic Development Board to do a study, and they 
came back and they said, &quot;You've lost $430 million in a three-year 
period.&quot; They were able to, at that particular point, put the numbers 
on that.  Once the lottery or gambling becomes integrated into the
economy, then it's much more difficult to go back and establish
a base line and see what the effects are.  But in this particular
instance, they were able to very well document the loss to the
local retail merchants.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And we haven't even talked about the implications of crime 
yet on the community.
<p>
When we come back, <i>Straight Talk</i> is going to look at more of 
the cost of gambling to a town, to a city, to a state. Please stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. We are looking at the issue of gambling and its tremendous 
negative impacts on a community, on a city, on a family.
<p>
Larry, you've got some interesting information there, taking a look at 
gambling.  What do you have for us there?
<p>
MR. HUFF: Yes, Kristi.  The attorney general of the state of
Maryland, just in October of this year, last month, just released
a report measuring the impact that gambling would have on the
issue of crime, and I want to read you a brief quote.  He said
this, quote:
<p><blockquote>
&quot;The impact would be this.  Casinos would bring
a substantial increase in crime to our state.  There would be
more violent crime, more crimes against property, more insurance
fraud, more white collar crime, more juvenile crime, more drug-
and alcohol-related crime, more domestic violence and child abuse,
and more organized crime.  Casinos would bring us exactly what
we do not need, a lot more of all kinds of crime.&quot;
</blockquote><p>
And again, this is the attorney general of the state of Maryland, who 
based this -- this is the executive summary of a long study that they
had done there in their state, with scientific measurable outcomes
on the impact that gambling has on communities.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And do we believe that?  What's your perspective?  Do you 
think that crime really is a variable?
<p>
MR. BROOKS:  I think that crime definitely is a variable.  It increases 
crime. Some of the attorneys general around the country have said that. I 
think in Connecticut the attorney general up there a number of years ago 
made some very definitive statements about that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And yet crime is not our only problem.  When we are talking 
about crime, we are talking about an industry that sucks people into 
itself, and we have pathological gambling, compulsive gambling.  What are
you all seeing on that?
<p>
MR. HUFF:  Kristi, I think again what is happening is you have people -- as 
we said in the last segment, it is a regressive tax on the poor, and when 
folks are already having a difficult time, and then they get into gambling 
as a regular habit, that puts them in a more desperate situation, and
being in those desperate situations, then they are more inclined
to be involved in desperate behavior. So I think it is just a
regression all the way from tantalizing involvement to seeing
the roots of that fleshed out in crime.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: Kristi, in Ohio, our attorney general serves with our governor 
on a coalition to prevent casino gambling from passing on a statewide ballot
initiative.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Amazing.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: And we have been battling that since 1989.  We are looking at it 
again this year.
<p>
When you talk about crime, you have to understand that gambling
is an addictive form of behavior.  Everybody knows that.  Not
everybody gets hooked, but the percentage of people who do exhibit
the same criminal tendencies as other people in addicted forms
of behavior, and that especially applies to matters like property
crime.
<p>
Crime in Atlantic City went up 300 percent with the advent
of casinos.  Now, they can blame it on people, but I've got news
for you.  The correlation just is not there.  When you have a
situation where people need money to take care of their fix, they're
going to hit property crimes; you're going to have petty crimes
and this sort of thing, the aggravated personal -- these are very
much in-your-face crimes.
<p>
The other form of crime that is very aggravated with casinos and with 
expanded gambling is embezzlement, the white collar crime, where people 
who are law-abiding, decent, middle-management types suddenly, because 
of their fix, start stealing from their employer.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: My understanding is that you also see, maybe through some 
of the crime issues, a decrease in property values in the areas surrounding 
casinos, even stretching 10 miles and 20 miles out away from that facility.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: That's an excellent point, and it is almost never brought up
in the debate.  That is the fact that when a casino gets in or
riverboats get in your backyard or back puddle, depending on what
it might be, suddenly the crime factor drives tax rates up because
of enforcement, which drives property rates down.  So people that
were sitting in cozy little suburbs suddenly find a new reason
for flight, and their property values go down.  So a casino in
your neighborhood could be a disastrous idea.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: One of the issue, I know, that you all are looking at on a state 
level, people are fighting the tax issue, and yet there is a direct 
correlation between the influx of gambling and the increased cost of law 
enforcement and prison kinds of monies.
<p>
Does this resonate with the lawmakers you are talking to at all, that 
you are going to be caught paying more in police protection, more in 
prisons, more in property crimes?
<p>
MR. GEER:  Well, it really depends on what is influencing the
legislators.  I mean, many of them are willing to look at the
debate and to understand the facts and to understand the empirical
evidence, as David has pointed out, and everyone else here, about
the reality of it.  Many of them, though, are influenced by political
contributions and other things that tend to blind them, if you
will, purposefully, to some of these factors.
<p>
But studies have been done in Alabama and in a number of different states, 
in Mississippi, in North Dakota, that indicate that, for the amount of tax 
revenue that comes into state or local officials, to the tax coffers,
they are spending more in terms of dealing with the compulsive
gambling.  When you have embezzlement, you have a situation where
there has to be money involved in that, or the social costs in
terms of helping those who are compulsive gamblers themselves,
a psychological addiction, as well as the cost of adding additional
policemen.  There is not a city that has allowed casinos in it
that has not had to significantly beef up their law enforcement
staff.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. GEER: Nobody wants more policemen if the reason for more policemen is 
because they have more crime, and that is what this will invite.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And the costs don't always balance out, do they?  The costs 
to a community in lost property values and increased crime.
<p>
MR. GEER: Well, again, these studies indicate that actually more money is 
spent in tax dollars than they bring in, and so it is a loss.
<p>
MR. HUFF: I think the perfect example of that is in Mobile, Alabama.  Mayor
Mike Dow, who was in favor of bringing gambling in because he
thought it would enhance the economic situation in Mobile, commissioned
a study of 41 social service executives, and they found that the
impact on the cost for the city of Mobile would be $15 million
for one city alone in social service costs to counter the problems
that gambling would effect.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: This brings back up, Kristi, the issue of good public policy. 
It is not good public policy for any government agency to advocate that 
people throw their money away.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: It is just not healthy.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That sounds logical to me.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: It is just not healthy, especially then when you consider 
the incredible costs that accompany this kind of compulsive behavior.
<p>
MR. SCIANNA:  And that is one of the ironies, too.  Many times
gambling is sold on the back of school kids.  The first thing
they will do is tell you that the lottery is going to benefit
education.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. SCIANNA: And the national study shows that states that earmark some 
or all of their gambling revenues for education, less than 4 percent of 
the education budget goes towards schools.
<p>
Just last year in Missouri, less than 2 percent of the state's education 
budget came from gambling revenues, and we have the lottery and riverboat 
gambling. That amounts to a little bit less than $5 per month per student 
enrolled in public schools in grades K-12, and there is a tremendous price
tag that comes along with it.
<p>
I would just like to revisit a second this issue of the crime, because 
the industry does talk about the fact that the crime rate does not increase. 
See, they talk about in terms of crime rate, and that is the amount of 
crime per person coming through, and they say if you have an influx
of a large number of people anywhere, crime will increase.
<p>
One of the things that we have seen in Missouri is, for instance,
the little town of Branson that has a population of 33,000 people
has an influx of 6 million tourists a year, and their crime rate,
which is the incidence of crime per the number of people coming
in, has not substantially increased at all.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And Branson is a family town, country music and --
<p>
MR. SCIANNA: Yes.  So it is not the quantity of people coming through 
as much as it is the quality of the people that you are attracting.
<p>
The New Jersey Crime Commission said, after reviewing all the statistics,
that, in their opinion, it was inescapable that casino gambling
is a magnet for street criminals.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You know, I was interested, when I was a reporter and Indiana 
was looking at a lottery, I asked one of the state officials if they were 
going to have a state fund for compulsive gamblers.  Since we say, well,
we'll have a drunk driving program, are we going to have a state
compulsive gambler program?  And he didn't answer my question.
<p>
But what are you finding at the state level?  Who helps these
people?
<p>
MR. GEER:  Well, that's really kind of one of the unfortunate
things, at least in my view, in terms of how this fight has gone
on, because there are compulsive gambling organizations that have
arisen that are helping those people who are caught in addictive
gambling.
<p>
In Pennsylvania, though, what they have done is struck
a deal with those who want to bring casinos and say, &quot;You
just give us a million dollars a year and we'll keep quiet about
opposing this.&quot;  And so they, in the interest of wanting
to help people, they think if they get money in that they are
going to be able to help people, and yet they are not standing
in opposition to this.
<p>
You know, as we talk about all of these statistics that are out there, 
I think it is the anecdotal things that we hear about.  I don't think 
there is any of us that does not know someone, somewhere, who has been 
caught in the web of addictive gambling, whether it is a businessman who 
might be listening to this who knows one of their employees who is 
embezzling. I talked to one in Erie, Pennsylvania, who had a woman who 
worked for him for many, many years.  She got caught in embezzling and
then ended up having to be fired.
<p>
So there are many people who hear these statistics, and they think, 
Well, it's not going to affect my family.  But the reality is that it 
will. And so all of us who hear these things have to realize that these 
are real people who are getting caught in this.  These are real damages
that will be caused to my communities, and I'm going to have to
stand up and stop it.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: You know, Michael, the thing that a lot of people aren't 
seeing now but are going to see more and more of is the issue of how this 
affects my family, my children, because statistics show that where casinos 
are, kids start showing up, and gambling is on the rise with those young 
people.
<p>
MR. BROOKS: Some of the statistics that we have seen, for example, in 
Atlantic City, there was a survey that found that 25,000 teenagers or 
minors were ejected from casinos in a single year, and 230,000 were denied
admission.
<p>
If gambling is there in a community, the teenagers will want to take 
advantage of it, just as they see their parents setting an example 
and gambling themselves.  If the state is saying it's okay, then to 
teenagers, yes, that's okay; the state has said this is a fine thing for 
us to do.
<p>
And when you get down to the level of how it impacts families, it really 
destroys families. We have several chapters of Gamblers Anonymous in North 
Carolina, not started because we have gambling in North Carolina legally,
but from people who have moved down from states that have gambling,
and they have set up Gamblers Anonymous chapters because that
is the only way that they are able to continue to deal with the
problem once they recognize that they are compulsive gamblers.
 They have to be in a support group to be able to deal with that
problem.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You know, there's a lot of human destruction
going on out there in the name of good government.
<p>
When we come back, <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i> 
is going to talk about some of the gambling initiatives at the local level
in each of these states.  Please stay with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i>. We are talking about gambling and the tremendous impact
it has on families at the state and local level.
<p>
Larry, you have worked on a lot of these gambling issues.  Where is the 
fight now as we are looking at it?
<p>
MR. HUFF: Well, Kristi, clearly, with lotteries in 37 states and casinos 
in 23 states and initiatives in a host of other states to bring the same 
to their own state, it is clearly on the state level.  I mean, there is a 
big push to legalize casino gambling probably more than anything else in
almost every state in the Union.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: They came at Ohio in 1989 in the legislature and their 
attempt failed.  In 1990 they went to the ballot and got beat two to 
one, thumped royally.  They came back again twice in the legislature,
and now they are back again with another ballot initiative for
1996, again riverboats.  The proposal changes a little bit every
time.
<p>
But, really, what is happening in the country is the evidence
is beginning to crest against them.  They have probably hit their
high-water mark, provided that citizens are not intimidated by
their big revenue and their big sales pitch.
<p>
You know, there is gambling in 23 states as far as the casino type, but 
there are only 10 states that have it, aside from the Indian reservations,
which is now a federal issue.  So they need more states, but they
are having a tough time to get them.  Since 1994, they have been
getting beat up on the ballot regularly.  So citizens are beginning
to have an impact, but they've got to get involved.
<p>
MR. SCIANNA: And it is important, too, that you look at the standpoint 
that, up until now -- and the information, as Dave said, is becoming
more and more readily available, and it goes against the industry,
because states have been in this very unique position of having
to both promote and regulate gambling.  They have become so dependent
upon the revenues that they have had to promote it; by the same
token, they have had to regulate it.  And so the evidence as it
begins to mount now is going to begin to show that the decisions
that they have made in fact have cost them more money that they
make them.
<p>
It is like nutritionists say that you could eat celery
and that you would actually burn up more calories chewing and
digesting celery than what you would get nutritionally from it.
And that's the same thing with gambling.  It looks like the coffers
are full, but in the end the states are going to starve to death
if they continue to rely upon it for revenue.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is astounding.  So, basically, the money -- it is 
all administrative, all, who knows, corruption, whatever, all legal fees, 
and very little in actual revenues.
<p>
MR. SCIANNA:  It is the social costs associated with it as well.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Astounding.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: And it is important to note that, again, it is the money 
that it sucks out of the economy that would be spent on bread and milk,
on carpet, on furniture, on refrigerators.  Anyone who owns a
small business in the retail side, anyone who is in the restaurant
business, and certainly anybody who has an employee base of manufacturers
should fight this thing tooth and nail because they are a massive
loser, a massive loser.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Go ahead.
<p>
MR. GEER: And this is not a little boy crying &quot;Wolf!&quot;  I 
mean, there is evidence.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: Certainly.
<p>
MR. GEER: This book is full of the evidence of every community that has 
adopted these, with all of the promises that were made of economic 
revitalization, and it has not worked.  And it is those businessmen, those 
businesswomen who own the restaurants, who own the refrigerator/appliance 
stores or the clothing stores, (who) are the ones who are paying the
price now.
<p>
As for those communities that don't have it, those people need to step up 
to the plate and say, &quot;We're going to fight this with our dollars, 
with our influence, and get involved.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And the book again is <i>The Lucky Business</i>, for 
those of you just joining us, with Robert Goodman.
<p>
So it is not the savior of a city?
<p>
MR. GEER: Not at all.
<p>
MR. BROOKS:  You know, Kristi, one of the things that we have seen in 
North Carolina, for example, as the evidence has been presented -- David 
was talking about how it takes a lot of money to sell lies, but in our 
case, all we have been able to do is to actually present the evidence
to legislators and to others who would listen on the gambling
issue, pointing out how it impacts the poor, it harms the poor,
it creates compulsive gamblers, and it destroys retail businesses.
<p>
I was testifying before a Senate committee a couple of years ago,
and back in the gallery were sitting all the convenience store
owners, and they were there to testify in favor of the lottery
bill.  Well, when I presented the evidence that I shared a while
ago about Virginia, there was this little buzz that started back
in the back of the room, and after the meeting I was able to give
them more information.
<p>
They came back this time in our legislature and were against. They 
had taken a position actually against the lottery privately. Publicly, 
they had set their numbers so high as to what they had to get to sell 
tickets, so they knew nobody would buy it.
<p>
So that was an interesting case of where a group of retail businessmen 
actually looked at the numbers and said, &quot;Yes, this is really 
true,&quot; and they checked with their cohorts in Georgia on the other 
side of us and in Virginia with the convenience store people, and they 
found out, yes, this is a real revenue loser for our businesses.  So that 
is the kind of thing where just getting the information out to people and
letting them see what the facts are can really make a difference.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Has the Federal Government saying that gambling
on the Indian reservations and all these newly discovered tribes
looking for newly discovered gambling licenses, has this impacted
you all negatively as you are looking at the gambling issue? 
In some ways, the Federal Government seems to have thrown its
weight in that area on the behalf of the gamblers.
<p>
MR. BROOKS: Yes, we have seen the situation develop in North Carolina 
where we've got one tribe who is looking for recognition.  They happen
to be a tribe that is located, if in fact they are a tribe, right
on I-95, halfway between North Carolina and Florida.
<p>
MR. GEER: Just coincidentally.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes, coincidentally.
<p>
MR. BROOKS: Between New York and Florida.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. BROOKS: But we have the Cherokee Indian Nation in western North 
Carolina, and we are somewhat perplexed as to how federal law deals with
this whole area, because federal law says that the Indians can
do in a state what the state allows.  Well, we only allow bingo
in North Carolina for charitable purposes.  Well, they have been
running bingo for years, but now, all of a sudden, they have decided
that they are going to put in casinos, and they simply have gone
in and put in two casinos.
<p>
I have been out there and looked at them, and they are the same kinds of 
casinos they have in Cripple Creek, Colorado, and some of the others. They 
have all the games and the one-armed bandits, electronic now -- there is 
no arm. But they are basically doing what we think is in violation of
the federal law, and there is a real squishy area there as to
who prosecutes.  The North Carolina attorney general says it is
not his responsibility because it's a federal law.  But yet, then
you rely on the federal district attorneys to prosecute, and so
far we haven't seen anything coming out of this administration
to indicate that they are going to do anything about it.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is not surprising.
<p>
MR. SCIANNA: This is also a tool that the industry uses against states as 
well. They pressure states and say, &quot;If you don't bring gambling in, 
then some Indian reservation will have it, and you're going to lose the chance
at getting the revenue as well.&quot;  And it is just that pressure,
that extra lever that they use to pry it in.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So we are probably going to see a more federalizing, then, 
of the gambling issue, perhaps.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI:  Well, the Indian question is going to have to be dealt with, 
because as the waves of gambling go, historically, once you hit the high-water 
mark, then you see things begin to roll back.
<p>
What is tragic, absolutely tragic, is what our government, with our tax 
dollars, has permitted to let happen to the Indian people.  I mean, we thought 
what happened to them the first time around was bad.  Look at what we are 
doing to them this time.  It is a disaster.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It is very disappointing.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI:  And it is all going to come back, because the 
negativities of gambling will cycle.
<p>
There was an instance just in northern California. You all probably heard 
about the Pomo Palace incident on an Indian reservation just a few months
ago, where they ended up in a shooting war for 11 days, I believe
it was, or 11 people were seriously injured.  They were up and
down the streets just like in the wild, wild west that started
out over a fist fight, which started out over an election over
who would control the Indian casino, the Pomo Palace.  People
ended up dead and wounded in the streets over this matter.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Amazing. You know, obviously, we are going to have to
keep watching this.  It is not going to go away.
<p>
I would like to thank my guests for being with us today.  Please stay

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. 
I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.  Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> takes a look at 
issues involving what some in our country see as the greatest tragedy we 
have allowed to permeate society since slavery, the sorrow of abortion. 
<p>
The pro-life movement held its annual March for Life on Monday, January 22, 
coinciding with the anniversary of the infamous <i>Roe v. Wade</i> Supreme 
Court decision. It's a case which tears the heart of our Nation in two. 
Since then, the pro-life and pro-abortion movements have been bitterly
locked together hoping to influence government and impact the
lives of Americans in the struggle.
<p>
Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> will bring you guests who are taking a look at 
where our country has been and currently stands in this abortion battle.  But 
the conflict goes much further than official Washington, and so we will be
talking with the new wave of pro-life activities.
<p>
But first, <i>Straight Talk</i> would like to show you some of the March for 
Life participants, who are rarely allowed to express their views in the media. 
We hope to show you some faces that look familiar, because they are
the faces of your mother, your sister, or your neighbor, someone
who has an opinion with whom you can identify and not be embarrassed
by the radical tirades so often portrayed in media coverage.
<p>
Let's hear why these individuals marched for life, reasons you probably
won't read in the newspapers or see on broadcast news, as <i>Straight
Talk</i> takes you Behind the Headlines.
<p>

<p>
[March for Life segments follow:]
<p>
MARCHER:  I don't know if I can, but I had two children out of wedlock, 
and it was my choice, and my husband and I now are proud parents because
we chose life and not abortion, and I'm sorry.  And my husband's
here for a personal reason from an older experience, and we just
think that if we could get everybody to listen to us and to know
that conception is the time that life begins and that it's not
later on, and these partial-birth abortions are the worst thing
I could ever imagine or think of.  There are plenty of us out
here who would adopt babies and who would take babies and who
can't have them, and that's why we're here, just to be heard.
<p>
MARCHER: We're hoping this makes a big impact on all the politicians
that are against the new bill that they're trying to pass.
<p>
MARCHER: Just not enough education for women, and that's why they make
the choice.  The doctors don't tell them enough and nurses don't
tell them enough, and they don't have enough education to know
that they're killing somebody and not taking a bloody mass out
of them.
<p>
INTERVIEWER:  What do you see as a viable alternative to this, to 
abortion?
<p>
MARCHER:  Lots of women who are raped decide that that's what they want 
to do because it was under such a vile circumstance.  But if you can just 
hang in there for nine months, just for the baby, and give enough of that 
of yourself, there's plenty of people out there who would adopt babies. I 
know there's lots of kids in foster homes now, but the problem is trying to
be solved, and there are responsible people out there who would
love to have the children.
<p>
I guess the most beautiful choice would be to raise your child, no matter 
what circumstance the child was conceived under.  Children just bring a 
great joy to your life, and I can't explain it.  You have to -- I don't 
know -- if you're a mother, you know.
<p>
MARCHER:  This is an issue that affects so many women, and what we believe is 
that, in the situation of a crisis pregnancy, the solution is to eliminate 
the crisis and not the child.  Abortion has not been the solution for women
that NOW and other so-called feminists claim it has been, and
we're here to say that you can choose life and be there for both
the woman and the child.
<p>
INTERVIEWER:  What do you see as the alternative for women [inaudible]?
<p>
MARCHER:  All kinds of situations, solutions: helping them through legal 
means, keeping their jobs, child support enforcement, getting the men in on 
this, you know, because they're half responsible, aren't they?
<p>
MARCHER: I'm here because I wanted to speak out against abortion.  I think 
that it's wrong, and I came to speak to our Congressman about it, but
I was really disappointed about the way it turned out.  The march
is going better, though.  It is more positive, and I think it
is lifting everybody up.  It's really great.
<p>
MARCHER: I'm definitely in support of getting rid of abortion.  I don't 
think it should be an option that is supported by our country.
<p>
INTERVIEWER: What do you see as alternatives [inaudible]?
<p>
MARCHER: That we should educate young women and young men of how to protect 
themselves from getting in a situation that might cause an abortion.
<p>
MARCHER: I think adoption is a good idea.  If you can't take care of the
child, I'm sure there's somebody out there that would really like
to.
<p>
MARCHER:  I'm here today because I'm on the battlefield for
life.  I am adamantly against death by abortion, and it's a life-and-death
issue.  You can't deny it.  If there's life in the womb, you have
to go in there to kill it, and that's what these abortionists
do, and they say, &quot;When does life begin?&quot;  It doesn't
matter.  They don't go in there and kill the life until the life
is there.  So, basically, it is a life-and-death situation.
<p>
The definition of abortion, according to Webster's dictionary, is
the termination of a pregnancy resulting in the death of a developing
human.  If there's death, there had to be life, and if there was
life and now death, it's murder.
<p>
The basic thing is that all women know, when they have sex, that they have 
run the risk of becoming pregnant.  They should be ready to accept the 
responsibility for their actions.  We have alternatives of adoption, we have 
crisis centers.  Every archdiocese of New York, especially our Cardinal
has said, Any woman that becomes pregnant, we will take care of
you, and if you don't want the baby, we will put it up for adoption.
 And a lot of the other bishops have said the same thing.  The
alternative is there.  You accepted the sex situation.  You're
pregnant; accept the responsibility.  Be a human being.  Don't
kill the human being within you.
<p>
MARCHER:  I'm here today to march for life because of the sanctity and the 
beautifulness of life, and I'm so glad to see this huge crowd.
<p>
MARCHER: We are here, the marchers, because we do not agree in abortion, 
and so we would like to see the laws changed so that abortion would be 
stopped and outlawed in our land, because it is murder.  No matter how
small that little fetus is, it is a human being, and they have
not been given a right to live.  Their right has been snuffed
out before they even get a chance to protest.  People are taking
their rights from them, and as I said, they are humans.  They
are gifts of God, and they have every right to be born.
<p>
I do not wish any person, woman, teenager, that has had an abortion, I
do not condemn them.  God loves them as well as He does everyone
else.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
begins our discussion about abortion and where the debate
is taking place today.  Please stay with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
[March segment]
<p>
MARCHERS: <i>Roe v. Wade</i> has got to go, hey, hey, ho, ho! <i>Roe 
v. Wade</i> has got to go.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  January 22, 1996, marked the 23rd anniversary of a decision 
that became one of the most famous and controversial court cases in our 
Nation's history, <i>Roe versus Wade</i>. Jane Roe, a pseudonym for Norma 
McCorvey(?), challenged Texas' 1857 statute making abortion illegal, and 
she won, bringing us to what pro-life advocates battle against today,
the legal authority for women to abort unborn children.
<p>
[March segment]
<p>
MARCHERS:  Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners
now and in the hour of our death.  Amen.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: To remind the Nation of this landmark decision, thousands of 
pro-life activists from across the United States marched from the White 
House to the Supreme Court steps, hoping to stir the hearts and minds of
our country's leaders and citizens.
<p>
[March segment]
<p>
MARCHERS: Mr. Policeman(?), tell me why unborn babies have to die.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Included in this year's March for Life was Norma McCorvey
herself.  Just a short time ago, Ms. McCorvey rocked the pro-abortion
movement by denouncing her 1973 decision and by announcing that
she had embraced the faith of so many of those who had prayed
outside the clinic doors she had helped open.
<p>
Has this stand against abortion forced women and men to consider the 
ramifications of abortion?  Or has the Nation accepted abortion as a 
viable means of birth control?  The 1996 March for Life participants don't
think so and, in marching, are sending their message loud and
clear to a nation and a world.
<p>
[March segment]
<p>
MARCHERS: Pro-choice, that's a lie.  Babies never choose to die.
<p>
MARCHER: I love you, Mom.  Thanks for saving me.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  As you could see, this year's March for Life was extremely 
successful in bringing individuals from across the Nation.
<p>
So to fill us in on why the pro-life movement is not giving up in the 
face of a pro-abortion Presidency and the liberal elite, we are talking to 
Cathy Deeds, Deputy Director of Government Relations for the Family Research 
Council, and Frederica Mathews-Green, a syndicated columnist and author of 
<i>Real Choices</i>. Welcome.  Thanks so much for joining me.
<p>
Frederica, you've been looking at abortion -- I read a very interesting 
article of yours in <i>Policy Review</i> -- as a societal issue, and I found 
it interesting about your background that you were involved in Feminists for
Life, which to some people is probably a little bit of a non-sequitur.
<p>
MS. MATHEWS-GREEN:  A contradiction in terms, that's right.  Well,
one of the reasons I came to Feminists for Life was that, 20 years
ago, I was a feminist for abortion.  So I have had a complete
change-around on the issue, and because of that, I am particularly
interested in persuasion and in helping people to turn around
and to begin to envision America without abortion.  We don't have
to go on with the status quo.  So I'm more concerned with that
than with politics, which kind of represents the two arms of the
movement, I think.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It's true.  What accomplished your change on the issue 
of abortion?
<p>
MS. MATHEWS-GREEN:  I read a description of an abortion in <i>Esquire</i> 
magazine, of all places. A doctor had asked to observe an abortion when a 
friend did one, and he described the woman lying on the table, and the 
doctor took the needle and stuck it into her abdomen, and then he began
to see how that the needle began to jerk and shake as the baby
died.  It was such a horrifying description to me, and at that
time I thought it was just a glob of tissue.  It never occurred
to me there was actually a baby in there fighting for its life.
 And that turned me around.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And that is pivotal, and we got to meet you. In your book, 
you were talking about why women were choosing abortion and why they were 
then, some, choosing not to have abortion.  As the pro-life movement kind 
of assesses where it is, what is moving the discussion from abortion to life?
<p>
MS. MATHEWS-GREEN:  I think that, paradoxically, one of the good
things that happened was that we had some losses.  I know this
sounds ironic, but I think that the fact that the Casey decision
was in some ways a setback for the pro-life movement, that we
had Bill Clinton elected President, that we took some punches
in the last few years, has allowed our friends on the pro-choice
side to begin to examine their own ambivalence.  And we're starting
to see this come out in some magazine articles and some other
places.
<p>
And as they begin to look at their ambivalence, they begin
to admit what I had to admit, that it actually is a child, and
is this really what we want?  Do we want an America where a million
and a half unborn children are being killed every year?  That
begins to open doors toward finding some solutions, I think.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You are noting ironically now that we have the most
pro-abortion President in the history of America, signing on the
anniversary of <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, within days of his being sworn in,
a series of executive orders to take abortion even further.  And
yet abortion numbers have been going down.
<p>
MS. MATHEWS-GREEN: Abortion numbers have gone down just very slightly, 
and it's one of those things you don't want to make too much of because
there are so many factors that might be influencing this.
<p>
One of the most hopeful, I think, is that polls done recently of teenage
kids say they're choosing abstinence at a much higher rate than
ever before.  The rates of children that are in high school that
are having sex before marriage are dropping and dropping.  Who
knows?  Maybe they are just coming to their senses.  But I would
certainly hope that that is one of the factors.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And then, hand-in-glove with the societal changes, we see 
change, Cathy Deeds, up on Capitol Hill.  Cathy has been up there for
quite a while.
<p>
The strategy on the issue of abortion in in some ways a hostile 
legislating environment has been interesting. It has not been a 
straight-up, let's-go-for-the-constitutional-amendment approach. 
How would you describe the strategy today as it parallels
and tracks the sort of change in abortion attitudes in the culture?
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  Well, I think we have a unique situation in the 104th
Congress because we have a pro-life Congress.  The majority of
the Congress is pro-life.  That has not been the case for years
and years.  So there are some things we can do because of that.
<p>
The problem is, as we have been talking about, we have a pro-abortion
President.  So although Congress may pass very strong pro-life
bills, they will not get past this abortion President.  So we
really have to look at issues of consensus.  There are many issues
like federal funding, for example, that the majority of people
oppose their tax dollars being used to fund abortion, those kinds
of things, and Congress has passed some of those measures this
year, and a few have gotten to President Clinton when it's in
another bill.
<p>
But I think if we look at issues in this current political situation, 
where we have the majority of the people, that's a possibility.  But it 
is a difficult situation.  We have a pro-abortion President who will veto 
a straight pro-life bill.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So in some ways a growing legal availability of
abortion has created some discomfort and led us to some consensus-possible
ground on partial birth.  The Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act --
Cathy, we want you to give us an update on that -- was fascinating
because people who had never cast a pro-life vote in their entire
lives said, &quot;I'm not in favor of taking children who are
viable outside the womb,&quot; which would be the majority of
those children who are pulled from the womb, a Metzenbaum scissors
stabbed in the base of their skull, and living brain tissue extracted,
killing them, and then removing the child.  And a lot of people
cast a vote for life on that.
<p>
Cathy, what is the status of that bill?
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  Well, we talked about that a little bit on this
program a month or so ago, and yes, it's very exciting that the
bill was passed overwhelmingly in the House and in the Senate,
by a narrow margin, but it did pass.  The Senate added some minor
amendments that we were able to support, but therefore, the House
and the Senate have two different versions of the bill, so it
has to be worked out, and most likely the House will take the
bill up again and then it will go to the President.  I am sure
of the timing, maybe a month or so.  And, of course, he has vowed
to veto this bill.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  It is just incredible to think -- I mean, we have done a 
tremendous, I think, education campaign.  A number of people have seen the 
ads that actually depict this procedure.  We have talked about that, 
actually seen what's happening.  This is a partially born child.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is right.
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  The Supreme Court never addressed the issue of a partially 
delivered baby.  Clearly, most people think that is wrong, and as you said, 
so many entrenched typically pro-abortion members supported a ban on this.  
And yet President Clinton, who is such an extremist on this issue, is still 
going to veto this.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Right.  You know, the majority of Americans are not even 
aware that abortion can take place after the first trimester.  They think 
that it is only in that first three months, and they are appalled to know 
that there is no legal reason why you can't pull a nine-month child out and 
kill them.
<p>
What other kinds of consensus, Frederica, do you see as possible
as you look at the way that society is going on abortion?
<p>
MS. MATHEWS-GREEN:  I think one of the things that is starting to
emerge is the voice of women who have had abortions who are experiencing
terrible grief.  I believe you will be talking about that later
in this show.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes.
<p>
MS. MATHEWS-GREEN:  But if you have had 33 million abortions now, I 
believe, in America -- and because of the repeat factor, I am not sure exactly 
how many women that involves -- but that millions and millions of women who 
have been told that abortion was a gift to you; it's a blessing; you
should rejoice; you have no right to sorrow; you have no right
to grieve -- and they grieve in silence, but you can't keep that
inside forever -- and I am seeing a rising tide of abortion grief
breaking forth as women talk about it.  I think this may become
a really overwhelming force.
<p>
So this is something that again will continue the change in the public feeling 
about abortion.  One of the problems we've had is, we've been saying, 
&quot;It's a baby,&quot; and they're saying, &quot;No, it's a woman's 
right.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes.
<p>
MS. MATHEWS-GREEN:  When women start saying, &quot;No, it broke my 
heart,&quot; that shoots that argument apart.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I want to hold up Frederica's book, <i>Real Choices</i>.
It's the kind of book that you have to encourage people to read,
because it's the heart behind the event.
<p>
It is interesting that when I was a reporter, I interviewed a psychologist 
who was not a person of faith at all, who said that he got involved in 
post-abortion counseling because women were testing as having been sexually
violated when they reported having had an abortion experience,
women who had not been raped, not been molested, and yet this
abortion was a violation of them.
<p>
Cathy, we don't have a lot of time.  Any other bills besides partial birth 
that we need to be watching?
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  There's a number of funding restrictions that we're trying 
to get enacted that are, unfortunately, bottled up in some of the 
appropriations bills that are stalled in the Senate or that the President 
has vetoed.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So people need to be writing --
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  So we are working on that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We have to encourage people to get some pluralized(?)
sentiment in letters and read the book.
<p>
MS. DEEDS: And also, you know, we are somewhat discouraged on the federal 
level at times with a pro-abortion President, but certainly efforts could
take place on a state level, and the state legislatures are restricting
abortion funding, and there's lots going on at the state level.
So people can watch that, too.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That will be fantastic.
<p>
Please join us after the commercial break as we speak to an attorney
who represents those whose lives have tragically been affected
by the malpractice of abortion doctors.  Stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. I would
now like to welcome Helen Donovan, an attorney who represents
individuals and their families who have been severely affected
by the mistakes which are sometimes fatal made by abortion doctors.
 It is a whole new kind of malpractice suit, and thank you so
much for joining us, Helen.
<p>
MS. DONOVAN: Thank you, Kristi.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I have seen some of the different random cases.  I think
one of the big differences now is this is not random at all. You represent 
one of several attorneys in a national perspective who are saying there 
are malpractice issues taking place here, and there is something we need 
to be looking at.
<p>
MS. DONOVAN: They are taking place all over the country.  Ours is a small
firm, Amshoff, Donovan and Smith, and we represent women all over
the country.  There are attorneys in every state who are representing
women, but our goal is to more or less go out there and say, wherever
you are, we would be willing to look at your records and see whether
you may have a legal claim.  We don't take cases unless there
is merit to them, meaning there was malpractice, there was negligence,
there was a lack of informed consent, there are real damages.
<p>
There are many women out there who, unfortunately, have been violated
somehow, but they may not have a case.  But I think everyone would
be surprised at how many thousands of women there are out there
who do have real legitimate, alive claims, in the sense that they
meet the statute of limitations.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  In terms of malpractice issues and abortion, do you find that 
that as a surgical procedure, given that I know your firm initially just 
looked at malpractice in general and now is looking at some of this 
specifically, is there a higher rate of incidence in abortion cases, in 
abortion practices, than other kinds of surgical procedures?
<p>
MS. DONOVAN: I think it would be hard to say that.  One of the problems with
the whole abortion issue is the statistics and reporting.  We
know there are deaths out there, and we know they are not reported.
We know there are sterilizations, as in life-saving hysterectomies,
that don't go reported, in all different ways of reporting, whether
they don't get reported to the vital statistics bureau or whether
they have no requirement to report them at all, you know, they
are a clinic or a doctor's office.  So it is very hard to say.
<p>
Because the procedure is so underregulated and there are many
physicians who are operating, you know, like they moved to a new
town, changed their name, and got their license renewed, I would,
in general, say that there are more complications.  Some of them
are uninsured.  Many of the physicians are uninsured, so they
just can push the woman out and that's the end of it, and they
know that she's not going to come back to their clinic when she
starts to have an emergency situation.  She is usually going to
go to the hospital.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What are the typically kinds of injuries that you are 
seeing? Or maybe it is not typical. But what is kind of the breadth of 
injuries?
<p>
MS. DONOVAN:  Well, there is a range.  We see some conditions where the 
woman started to hemorrhage a couple of days after the abortion.  She ended
up going to the emergency room and they did another D&amp;C on
her.  Very traumatic for her, probably not a big-time case.  She
may have had retained parts.  That is very common.  She may have,
unfortunately, passed the head of the baby in the toilet.  She
is certainly traumatized by that, but it is going to be difficult
sometimes for us to find a doctor to say, &quot;Yes, that was
a breach of the standard of care, equals negligence; you've got
a malpractice case.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MS. DONOVAN: And the other gamut would be death.  There are numerous 
fatalities out there, and those occur in hospitals as a result of clinic
abortions and as a result of doctor's office abortions.  Doctor's
office abortions and clinic abortions kind of get mixed together,
because many places the people presume that's an abortion clinic.
You know, it has the names on it like a clinic.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.  It has kind of the look of the traditional clinic.
<p>
MS. DONOVAN:  It is listed under &quot;Abortion services&quot; in
the Yellow Pages.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MS. DONOVAN: It turns out that it is actually operating as a doctor's 
office, which means it doesn't have to meet any of the state requirements 
for an ambulatory surgical facility if that state has a regulation
that says abortion clinics and/or ambulatory surgical facilities
will have the following services available.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So they're sort of making it appear they have one set of 
services and having a completely other set.
<p>
MS. DONOVAN:  Well, it's a doctor's office, so it has nobody measuring the 
standards or anything like that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So what kinds of cases are you looking at, then,
in terms of that?  What are some of the horror stories you have
seen with your own eyes?
<p>
MS. DONOVAN:  Well, certainly we have a number of death cases on our docket, 
and I am reluctant to talk about our cases before there is a judgment or a 
settlement; one, because we never want to be accused of taking our case to 
the media.
<p>
But I do look in the papers and track as many other cases
as I can, and I am sure many people are familiar with the recent
conviction of the New York physician who killed a woman.  Well,
he had five -- his license was already revoked and he was appealing
it, so they still let him practice medicine, and he had numerous
other violations, and he is one who had changed his name and moved
to a new part of town.
<p>
I just heard of a terrible situation in Florida where apparently a 
girl may be facing a number of amputations because of complications.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  She was a diabetic or she had a circulation problem 
following the abortion?
<p>
MS. DONOVAN: I am not familiar with all the facts.  Actually, a news source
called me and asked me about that one.  Numerous young girls die
from abortion.  In Chicago, a 13-year-old; Alabama, 18-year-old;
Houston, Texas, 15-year-old and immigrant.  And that is also very
common.  Young girls who are very afraid, who aren't going to
ask lots of questions, and who also may not have a good understanding
of their own medical history.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Who probably wouldn't know the questions to ask even 
if they asked a lot.
<p>
MS. DONOVAN: Right, or maybe they don't understand the informed consent 
form, but they're not going to ask, &quot;Yeah, I'd like to really talk
to the doctor about this informed consent form.  I'd like to have
him explain to me what perforation means or what hemorrhage means.&quot;
You know, they are not going to go into the details that that
might require.  Or if they do ask, they are going to be told,
&quot;Oh, don't worry about those.  That never happens.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What have you seen in terms of jury reactions and
judge reactions to the emotional trauma issues?  I mean, so often
pain and suffering is the jury button to push, it would appear.
So for a person who did pass a head, did pass limbs, and was
traumatically faced with the fact that there is a person inside
myself who has died and I am very traumatized by that, are juries
and judges at all empathetic to that for these women?
<p>
MS. DONOVAN: I think it varies.  There are some precedents where women 
who did pass the baby afterwards did recover for emotional damages,
and that would be sort of strictly emotional images.  There are
other cases where that gets no sympathy.  I would say that judges
and juries vary as Americans vary, and it is very difficult to
predict in any case how it is going to go.
<p>
Many people have no sympathy for the woman who chose an abortion, 
regardless of the fact that this is medical care provided in their 
community, and it is obviously substandard, and you would think that 
everybody would be just as concerned about this procedure as any, but --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We don't have a lot of time yet, but have the feminists
and some of the liberal women's organizations come alongside you?
 I mean, this would seem like a women's health issue; yet my understanding
is that women have distanced themselves from it.
<p>
MS. DONOVAN: Well, I would say that the radical feminist movement would 
like us to just shut up and go away.  We are often portrayed as just
harassing doctors and clinics and things like that, which is hardly
the case.  We cannot afford, both money or resource-wise, to prosecute
any case that is not meritorious.
<p>
So we hope in the long run they will see that they have as much interest 
in protecting women from unsafe clinics and doctors as we do.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  As you would.
<p>
When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will be talking to a man who took
it upon himself to help women in crisis pregnancies.  Please stay
with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We are back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. Tonight we are talking about abortion and its 
effects on individuals' lives, and I am joined by Woody FitzHugh, a golf 
professional who has a testimony of his own and decided to given women a 
viable option to abortion.
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH: Thank you, Kristi.  Nice to be here.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Thanks for being with us.
<p>
You have been interested in the pro-life movement for quite a while, but 
how initially did you decide to get involved in creating an alternative? 
We will get into what the alternative is in a second.
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH: Okay. Well, the transformation in my life I owe to two 
people who inspired me.  Firstly would be Jesus Christ and secondly is
my wife, who has stuck me all these years and been very supportive
in everything I've done.
<p>
It was actually in 1994 when, as Bill Clinton became President and he 
signed a fetal tissue research bill on June 10, I just had a furious 
feeling towards him and I wanted to something to help the situation, 
and I began studying about the situation and found out that it seemed 
to be considered by most people to be a women's issue.  We all know, 
if you think about it, that it's not just a women's issue.  There is a 
man involved every time.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH: So I felt like I could do something, and I wasn't going to 
go shoot a doctor or anything, so I felt like as I grew and matured as
a Christian that that is when I felt like I heard from God in
not to be a fanatical way but in my own spirit that I ought to
do something to help this situation, and that is how the idea
came about.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And the idea was -- now, to go back to your man comment 
for a second, did you feel like, look, I don't care if I'm not allowed 
in here, that I want to get into this issue?
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH:  Absolutely.  I feel like this is the most
heinous crime that has ever befallen this country, and there has
to be something done to stop it.  We are losing babies every 20
seconds.  We are losing entire generations at a time, and there
seems to be no one out there standing up and saying, &quot;Hey,
this is really wrong.&quot;  I mean, I know there are many of
us who are, but according to, if you read the liberal media and
what not, they have control, and so you very seldom hear anything,
and I just felt a great desire to get involved and do what I could.
<p>
I mean, I am one person.  I am not an expert, as the other panelists
were, but I felt a desperate need to do something.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: In fact, you are a golf professional, and you have a long 
history in sports.  And so what did a sportsman decide to do?
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH: Well, I was at a golf tournament at the time it happened, 
and I had a revelational experience in which I felt that the best
thing for me to do was to be an open home in which the women could
come as an alternative to abortion and be protected, have shelter,
have services rendered to them, have a Bible study perhaps or
some kind of a training program, job training and some nursing
care, and so that is how the idea began, and two years later --
we actually purchased the house on January 22, 1994, the anniversary
of <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, and now we just passed our second year, and we
are very close to opening the doors.  About another week, we will
be letting the girls in.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And what is so fascinating about your story, Woody, is 
that -- I mean, here you are, a man in your community that has been 
involved. You took your own money and you bought a house to make a place 
for women and their children, which is pretty amazing.  I mean, what has 
been the reaction of the community to your gesture to reach out to these 
women?
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH: We have had so much support from really everyone that
it has been a wonderful experience from the very get-go.  We have
had laborers, construction workers, wanting to help, donating
their time, helping to build the entire house.  We actually had
to renovate the entire house.  It was an 1891 hotel which was
very dilapidated at the time that we took possession of it, and
so it needed all kinds of work, and the volunteers just came from
all the churches and all different kinds of walks of life, and
laborers, and we have doctors now who are going to deliver the
babies for free; we have nurses who are going to go check on the
girls; we have just support from every angle, and it has been
a wonderful thing.  It is very exciting to see it unfold.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And where will the girls come from?  How will girls
hear that this is a home that they can come and live in -- right?
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH: Right, absolutely.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And stay and get some training and some support, and you 
don't throw them out when they have the baby; you are going to help 
them segue into the community.
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH:  Absolutely.  We have job training, as I said, and they 
will be learning to do some kind of vocational skill, and we will allow 
them to stay at least six months after the pregnancy comes to term, and 
we will do that to help get them back on their feet, because the worst 
thing to do is just to shelter them until the baby is born and then say, 
&quot;Thanks a lot. See you.  Next girl, come in.&quot; We want to make a 
change in their lives.
<p>
We want to save the children, and we want to give them a good start in 
their lives beyond the time that the baby is born.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Fantastic.  How will girls come to you?
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH: Sorry.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And we want to give a phone number, too.
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH:  Yes.  The girls will come to us from the various pregnancy 
centers as well as from any church counseling.  Pastors, if they find out 
that a girl in their church has gotten pregnant, they will send them to us. 
And, basically, crisis pregnancy centers throughout the area.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: This is very exciting.  For anybody that wants more information, 
they can call us at Family Research Council.  Thank you so much, Woody,
and to all my guests.
<p>
When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> looks at what Gary Bauer, president 
of the Family Research Council, has to say regarding the abortion issue 
in his speech given to those involved in this year's March for Life.  Don't go 
away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. We now bring you
a portion of the speech given at the March for Life Rose Dinner
by Gary Bauer, president of the Family Research Council.  Gary
presents thought-provoking insights into the abortion debate.
Let's take a look as <i>Straight Talk</i> brings you our Homefront News.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>
<p>
[Segment from March for Life Rose Dinner follows:]
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Thank you very much.
<p>
I want to talk to you this evening not only about the direct subject
of the sanctity of human life but also about our country and the
relationship of the sanctity of human life to America and to its
future.
<p>
I fell in love with America a long, long time ago, as
I know each and every one of you did, too.  And so it's worth
it for us tonight to think about our country and about its hopes
and dreams and about its fears and nightmares.
<p>
You know, there's that great old book that I am sure all of you are very 
familiar with, <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> by Charles Dickens, and you may 
remember that the book begins with that wonderful line, &quot;It was the
best of times and it was the worst of times.&quot;
<p>
Now, the line was obviously written about England and France many years 
ago, but I believe it is a perfect description of America in 1996.
It is the best of times, and it is the worst of times.
<p>
You know, there are many ways that you can measure a great nation.  You
can measure it by the strength of its military or the growth of
its economy or the gleam of its cities, and by those measurements
the United States is a great nation.
<p>
But you can also measure a nation by how many of its children cry themselves 
to sleep at night, and the fact of the matter is that tonight in America 
too many of our children will cry themselves to sleep.  Too many children
abandoned, too many children without a father's arms to comfort
them.  Too many children already exploited through pornography
or slaves to drugs or sexually abused.
<p>
Ladies and gentlemen, by those measurements, the United States is in danger 
of becoming something other than a great nation.  And to top it all off, 
1.6 million of those children, this year and every year, will not
even make it out of the womb alive, and by that measurement, we
are in danger of becoming something less than a great nation.
<p>
I believe there is a sense in the United States today that we
are all one wrong turn away from a disaster.  And so what in the
world happened to this shining city upon a hill that the founding
fathers wanted and tried to give to us?
<p>
I think the first thing that happened is that we forgot God, and having 
forgotten God, we have unleashed the hounds of hell on our streets and our 
neighborhoods and our communities.  How ironic that that would happen here,
of all places.  Every one of us has in our pockets, or you ladies
in your purses, money that says, &quot;In God We Trust,&quot;
and the phrase has become as cheapened and as devalued as the
money it is printed on.  Lincoln called us the almost chosen people.
<p>
But to listen to the experts today, you would think the greatest
danger facing America is that men and women of faith like you
may actually go into the public square and assert God's word on
issues like the sanctity of human life or what it is we owe to
those who are more disadvantaged than us, and I am here to tell
you tonight, ladies and gentlemen, that unless you go into the
public square, America will not survive in the next century.
<p>
[Applause.]
<p>
The second thing that has gone wrong is that we have neglected
and failed as a culture and a society to pass on the great traditions
of our culture to our children.  We could spend all evening talking
about that issue alone.  Our children sit on the shoulders of
giants.  And yet the research shows that most American young people
have no idea of the sacrifices that have been made for the liberty
that they have today.
<p>
I think the third thing that has happened is that we have allowed 
Washington, D.C., and the people in Washington to become our masters 
instead of our servants.  And I don't point to any particular party; I 
point to both parties.  It's time for us to remind both parties that our 
liberty comes from no man; it comes from God.  It doesn't come from the 
President of the United States; it doesn't come from the Speaker of the 
House. It comes from God, and it is guaranteed to us by the original
contract with America, the Declaration of Independence and the
Constitution of the United States.
<p>
[Applause.]
<p>
The fourth thing that has happened -- and perhaps this should be at the 
top of the list, because all of these really are related to one another
-- is the issue that brings you here every year, that in this
country we have allowed the sanctity of human life to evaporate
and slip through our hands, and we pay the consequences every
day, not only in abortion but in city streets that we are fearful
to allow our own children to walk on.
<p>
Now, it is impossible to come to Washington, D.C., and have a dinner like 
this and not have a speaker like me turn to the question of politics.  And
so I know in an audience like this that there are both Republicans
and Democrats, and I want you to have patience with me because
I am going to insult you both.  Let me begin with the Democratic
Party, because that is the one that is easier for me to insult.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
You know, I grew up in a Democratic home, a blue-collar family, and 
whether you are a Democrat or not, you have to concede that the Democratic 
Party, over the years, has been the party of the little guy.  They were 
there at the beginning of the civil rights movement.  They were there to 
build a safety net for the poor in the United States, and they deserve great 
credit for being there for the little guy and when working men and women 
were organizing in the factories of America.  It is a great history and 
tradition that the Democratic Party has.  But on this issue, they have 
abandoned the littlest guy of all.
<p>
Let me share some letters with you. Here's a letter written back in the 
early 1970s. &quot;While the deep concern of a woman bearing an unwanted 
child merits consideration and sympathy, it is my personal feeling that 
the legalization of abortion on demand is not in accordance with the values 
which our civilization places on human life.  Wanted or unwanted, I
believe that human life, even at its earliest stages, has certain
rights which must be recognized:  the right to be born, the right
to love, the right to grow old.&quot;
<p>
Now, that couldn't have been said better by Nellie Gray or Jim Dobson. 
That was written by Ted Kennedy in 1971.
<p>
Here's a telegram in 1977, an open letter to Congress: &quot;As a matter 
of conscience, I must oppose the use of federal funds for a policy of 
killing infants.&quot; The sender of the telegram is referring to the 
effort in Congress at the time to subsidize abortions, and he called it 
killing infants. Was that written by Jesse Helms?  No, that was a telegram 
sent by Jesse Jackson on September 6, 1977.
<p>
Here's one written in 1986: &quot;In my opinion, it is wrong to spend federal 
funds for what is the taking of a human life.  It is my deep personal 
conviction that abortion is wrong.&quot;  Signed by then Senator Al Gore,
now the Vice President of the United States, who is sent by President
Clinton all over the world to promote abortion on demand.
<p>
And speaking of President Clinton, here is a letter in 1986 signed
by then Governor Bill Clinton:  &quot;I am opposed to abortion
and to government funding of abortions.&quot;
<p>
What happened to these men between the time that they wrote these letters 
and today is that they sold their souls for political gain, and they ought
to be ashamed of themselves.
<p>
[Applause.]
<p>
Now, what about the Republican Party?  Well, all during the 1980s, the 
Republican Party provided the leadership for the pro-family and pro-life 
movement, and I was proud to serve in the Reagan Administration during those 
years. But having said that, I also don't have to remind you that there
are some party leaders, some pollsters and pundits in the Republican
Party walking around with their finger up in the air trying to
figure out which way the wind is blowing and ready to sell you
out on this issue.  And it just doesn't come from those in the
liberal wing of the party.
<p>
So I am here tonight to say to the National Democratic Party and to the 
weak-kneed Republicans, of which there are some, that if neither of you 
know how to turn saving babies into a winning political issue, the American 
people may eventually decide that neither of you deserve to be the governing
party of the United States.
<p>

<title>Straight Talk November 1, 1995 Transcript</title>
<body>
<center><h2>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</h2>
<p>
<h4>Broadcast aired Wednesday, November 1, 1995, 8:00-9:00 P.M.</h4></center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You've never seen this show before, <i>Straight Talk
from the Family Research Council</i>.  You may be wondering what we're
about or why we have a television show.
<P>
 Well, the Family Research Council has been researching and influencing
government and cultural policies affecting the American family
since 1981.  Already this year, Family Research Council has appeared
on more than 50 television programs, from CNN's <i>Crossfire</i> to PBS
<i>MacNeil-Lehrer</i> to ABC's <i>Nightline</i>.  In fact, we are profiled in
the <i>New York Times</i> news feature, today.
<P>
 We've responded to what many have to say about families.  I am
your host, Kristi Hamrick, and now <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i> gives you the opportunity to hear what we have
to say, unedited.
<P>
 You watch the news and read the newspaper, but do you ever wonder
if you're getting the real story?  Gary Bauer is one source that
you can trust.  He knows what is happening behind Washington's
closed doors, from years of experience, from the Reagan White
House to grassroots America.  For a news perspective you can't
get in the newspapers, our first segment features Gary Bauer,
president of the Family Research Council, Behind the Headlines.
<P>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<P>
Gary, it has been a very historic week on Capitol Hill, and particularly
with the budget.  We've seen some real fights, almost to the finish.
 What's your perspective on the historic things we have been seeing
lately?
<P>
 MR. BAUER:  I think what's so unique about this past week is
that we've had a group of people run for office last year promising
the American people they would cut the budget, they would get
a balanced budget on the books that really would be predictable
and something where there would be a deadline for that balanced
budget.  And they have come to Washington and, lo and behold,
they have actually done what they said they were going to do in
the campaign.
<P>
 There has been a lot of public cynicism, and legitimately so,
in the last few years, about politicians saying one thing and
doing another.  But this latest group of Congressmen and Senators
have fulfilled their promises, and I think the American people,
over the next year, when they begin to look at the details instead
of listening to some of the scare tactics, are going to be astonished
and quite pleased that we now have some fiscally responsible people
in Washington and are cutting back the size of government.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  In this budget debate, we have seen some new heroes
as a result of the last election.  What's your perspective on
who deserves the credit for the historic things taking place on
Capitol Hill?
<P>
 MR. BAUER:  There's a lot of good guys in the House and Senate,
but I think the thing that really stands out is this freshman
class, particularly in the House of Representatives.  They have
come here, and they haven't been taken in by the power structure
of Washington at all.  They really have moved to cut some programs
that even impact their own home districts.  They have been willing
to take on their own leadership on occasion, which is really extraordinary
for freshmen.
<P>
 And so I think there has been a real generational change.  If
we have a couple more cycles like this where the types of people
you get in the House and Senate from both parties are more willing
to deal with some of these tough issues, I think the country will
be a lot better off for it.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  I think what strikes me about that -- and I am
interested in your perspective -- is here we see the most successful
class of recent history, maybe of all time, in terms of a real
change from the floor up, saying it's economic and social issues.
 At the same time, we see the GOP, it would appear, ready to throw
away the marriage of those issues and go with someone like perhaps
a Powell.  Colin Powell is in the news a lot lately.  What's your
perspective on what it means for the GOP or just what it means
for the current political climate?
<P>
 MR. BAUER:  Well, you know, Christy, I think the important thing
here is not the Powell candidacy or Bob Dole's candidacy or Phil
Gramm's candidacy; all of that will sort itself out, I think,
in the months ahead.  But the key thing really is what kind of
party is it; what are the principles the party stands for.
<P>
 I got into politics way back in 1964 in the Barry Goldwater campaign,
which was a disaster at the polls but began the movement in the
Republican Party to becoming a predictably conservative traditional
party.  And as the party stood for those principles over the years
after that, it began to win elections.  When it violated some
of those principles, the conservative coalition got divided, and
then we would lose elections.
<P>
 I guess the most obvious example is when some of his advisors
convinced George Bush to raise taxes.  I understand the pressure
he was under, but that was a mistake, and it ended up creating
Ross Perot and costing Bush the election.
<P>
 My hope would be that whoever the nominee of the party is a year
from now, that the party remembers that it has gotten this success
because it stood for things:  low taxes, smaller government, traditional
family values, the sanctity of life, a strong foreign policy.
 Those are the things that have gotten the party where it is today.
 Those are the things, I think, that can carry it into victory
later and make it the majority party in the next century, and
those are the things that I certainly want to fight for in the
months ahead.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  One last question, Gary.  There is a lot going
on on the Hill, and I know you need to get back to the phone calls,
Congressmen and Senators lining up.  But one thing that we hear
a lot about these days is that social conservatives are willing
to give on certain points.  And yet one of the things I know that
-- some of the data that Family Research Council has been looking
at, original polling, would indicate that some of those values
aren't for sale.  What's your perspective on whether or not conservative,
pro-family Americans are willing to have victory at any cost or
whether there are some things that are going to be sticking points
as people start looking at their platforms, issues, and just the
kind of society we want?
<P>
 MR. BAUER:  I think this is really important for the party establishment
to understand.  If the party walked out again on tax issues, for
example, or if for some bizarre reason it became a big-tax party,
millions of voters would walk out of the party at that point.
 These voters believe that Americans are overtaxed.  I believe
Americans are overtaxed.  So the party really needs to stay with
that issue.
<P>
 Likewise, if the party walked out on the concept of the sanctity
of human life, or if they walked out on issues involving parents
and the rights they ought to have in raising their children, if
they did that, there is a significant segment of the Republican
Party that would walk out on them.
<P>
 So I think it is a pretty basic issue.  Parties stay together
and become majorities because they deal with the issues that draw
those voters to them, and when they abandon those issues, the
voters abandon the party, and I think that is what would happen
in 1996.  I hope the party or no one in the party is so foolish
as to think that they can throw anybody in the coalition a bone
and somehow still get their votes on election day.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  Thanks for being
with us, Gary.  We'll look forward to some of your insights next
week. When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we'll ask some hard
questions about what is happening to our children's education.
 Stay tuned.
<P>
 [Commercial break.]
<P>
 ANNOUNCER:  Parents want their children to learn how to read,
to write, to do math, and to tell right from wrong.  We want schools
that teach sound curriculum and positive values, schools where
teachers are good role models.  At one time, it didn't seem like
this was too much to ask, but today our school system is not accomplishing
this essential task.
<P>
 Secretary of Education Richard Riley says that he has the answer.
 He says that he has a system that works, and it is called Goals
2000.  Those opposed to Riley believe that Goals 2000 creates
federal control over our children's education and over our rights
as parents and communities to have a say in that education.
<P>
 As a result, some states refused to cash in on the program. 
Virginia and New Hampshire never took a penny of the Goals 2000
funds, and Alabama recently sent back the $1.4 million in federal
funding they had received under Goals 2000.  If other states follow
suit, Goals 2000 may eventually go out of business.
<P>
 But for now, a growing number of parents are becoming increasing
disillusioned and distrustful of the public school system.  More
children are being enrolled in private schools, and some 400,000
families are currently homeschooling.
<P>
 The homeschool movement has become a promoter of strong family
relations and a model grassroots organization, providing a framework
for educational reform.  Yet Riley contends that Goals 2000 would
benefit all families, and he claims that there are no strings
attached.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  What are parents to believe?  Bill Mattox, Vice
President for Policy, and Jennifer A. Marshall, Education Policy
Analyst, both with the Family Research Council, are here to help
us understand why, for some, Goals 2000 is a four-letter word.
<P>
 Jennifer, you've worked quite a bit on education issues for us,
and what we have seen is that it is one of those things where
the advertising doesn't really represent the product.  What is
in Goals 2000 that gives us concern?
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  It is easiest to look at Goals 2000 as an application
process, where the state is required to do certain things to get
money from the Federal Government, and the Federal Government
requires that a state would turn in its standards and its assessments
in order to get money for this.  And that is an inappropriate
role for them.  They are not to be dealing with curriculum.  Historically,
they haven't been allowed to; now they have transgressed into
that area.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  So it is kind of like all the schools have to submit
their lesson plans -- 
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  Exactly.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  -- and the Federal Government is going to say,
&quot;I like it; I don't like it.&quot;
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  Yes.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  But some would say national standards are a good
thing.  I mean, we are looking at inner-city schools with falling
test scores, and we are saying, How do we make it better?  Why
not national standards?  I mean, what's wrong with that?
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  It's an easy answer; you're right.  But we've
seen with these national history standards exactly what can go
wrong.  They're easily captured by a political faction, and for
anybody who didn't think that the politically correct, anti-American
history standards that we saw last year were a problem, well,
what if Senator Jesse Helms or Representative Newt Gingrich had
written those?  I think we would have a different picture.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  What's kind of interesting about Goals 2000 is
it makes it out as though government is the solution to our educational
problems.  And, Bill, I know you have taken a look at children
who really do succeed.  A lot of people may have seen some of
Bill's columns country-wide, as a matter of fact, from the Detroit
News even on this topic.
<P>
 What have you seen, Bill, in terms of children who succeed? 
Why do they succeed in school?
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  Well, it's interesting.  For a long time, there
has been a great deal of inquiry into questions about why do kids
in certain schools do better than those in others, and dating
back to the mid-1960s, one of the things that has shown up consistently
in the research is that it is not so much what goes on at the
school that may be ultimately most significant; it is, instead,
what is taking place in the home and how rich a learning environment
kids have in the home.
<P>
 When kids have the benefit of growing up in a household where
their parents are actively involved in reading to them, in sharing
in mealtimes where there is a rich dinnertime discussion, in tucking
them into bed and that kind of thing, there are significant differences
that show up in terms of how well kids do in school.  How much
access kids have to home learning tools, to encyclopedias, books,
newspapers, computers, things of that nature, have a dramatic
effect on a child's learning.
<P>
 One of things that I guess concerns me a great deal about Goals
2000 is that it further marginalizes parents.  It kind of pushes
them to the periphery of the education of children and does not
recognize them as a central player.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  Now, Secretary Riley -- I have seen the news conference
where he was talking about this new partnership with parents and
how important that they are.  Does anything the government is
doing right now, or maybe the Clinton Administration, really facilitate
a greater partnership with parents?  I mean, in Goals 2000, is
one of the goals Mom and Dad showing up and helping?
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  There is quite a bit of rhetoric, actually, about
parental involvement.  But we find a problem when it is the government
defining exactly what parental involvement will be.  We have seen
parents be relegated to a back seat -- just pay and be quiet about
the way schools are run -- and that is not an appropriate role
for involving parents at all.
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  Yes.  I mean, this is such an important point, because
a lot of times, you are right, there is a lot of lipservice about
parental involvement.  The Secretary just put out a report last
year saying, Boy, parents are key to education.  And yet when
you stop and really examine what they are saying, the way that
they define parental involvement is, well, if you think of a potluck
dinner, I think they seem to think that what schools and experts
like themselves provide is kind of the meat and potatoes of education,
and what parents provide is kind of the dessert.  It's a nice
frill, but it's not absolutely essential to the well-being of
children and to their educational development.  And yet the research
consistently contradicts that point of view.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  One would think, if you look at some of the Clinton
Administration rhetoric on Goals 2000, that every state is clamoring
for this money, because it all comes down to money.
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  Yes.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  Jennifer, what does your analysis show in terms
of how states -- are they embracing this?  Are they exciting about
it?  What's happening at the grass roots?
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  You'd be surprised at how much murmuring there
is against Goals 2000, both at the federal and the state level.
 Two states flat out said, &quot;No, we will not take this money.&quot;
 They absolutely rejected the money, and that was New Hampshire
and Virginia.  And then we saw an almost unprecedented move of
Alabama to send back federal money and say, &quot;No, thank you;
we won't stoop this low to take this money.&quot;
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  That's kind of astounding.
<P>
 I know, Bill, you've been looking at different educational reforms
in the state.  What states have seen better numbers, or have we
seen better partnerships with parents anywhere?
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  Well, the key, I think, is to not think so much
in terms of systems or even in terms of states, but to really
look at how can we succeed in furthering education at the local
level, because one of the things that comes out of the research
again consistently is not just that parents are central players
in this process, but when they are surrounded by a community of
adults that are prepared to help them in that process and to support
them, then you then see the kinds of results that I think we are
all looking for.
<P>
 And so I think a lot of the key to this debate is getting the
discussion back to the local level, getting the Federal Government
-- and even in many ways the state government -- out of the action
and really putting emphasis on the local community and especially
on parents.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  I have been really interested as I have been looking
at the data that small things -- whether you read to your child,
which we'll talk more about later; whether a parent even attends
a PTA meeting, or whether there is even a father in the home --
that even family structure needs to be read, rather than what
dollars per child in education.
<P>
 Bill, you headed a fathership program at Family Research Council
for a long time now, Being a Dad Is Important Business.  Just
quickly, as we are getting near the end, what do we know about
the importance of even a father in the home, or for those people
with broken family structures, the importance of having a dad
involved, or a dad figure?
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  Well, this is a very important point, because a
lot of the research tends to focus on what are sometimes defined
as process variables; that is, are families eating together, are
they reading to children, are there various processes taking place
within the family that might enhance a child's learning?
<P>
 And yet we know that families in which fathers are present are
much more likely to have these kinds of things take place.  There
are dramatic differences in the rates, say, for example, of how
many family meals a family might enjoy together between two-parent
and single-parent households, and it's not because single mothers
have any less desire to be home and to be able to sit down and
dine with their kids; it is that they are quite often facing extraordinary
odds in trying to do the work of two parents by themselves.  And
it becomes very difficult for all the different trains to run
on time and for them to have the kind of routine that is actually
quite important to a child's well-being and educational development.
<P>
 So it is important that we recognize that the contribution that
families make is one that comes from these different processes
taking place, but there are family structures -- namely, those
in which both parents are present -- that lend themselves more
to these kinds of activities than single-parent families.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  Now, Goals 2000, Jennifer, it tries to say that
if we tweak things -- numbers of books, numbers of classrooms,
teacher ratios -- that it is all the hard variables, hard-wired
things, that make a big difference.  Is that accurate?  Would
you say that Goals 2000 says, &quot;Give me enough books; I can
give you an A student&quot;?
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  They focus on something called opportunity-to-learn
standards, which is just what you've described:  what goes in,
the inputs, measuring how much we've got there.  And it's all
about systems management.  It doesn't deal with the classroom
learning, the human variables, as Bill as spoken of, at all.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  And the human variables make a big difference.
<P>
 When we come back, we're going to add some more human variables.
 We're going to be talking with Mike Farris, president of the
Homeschool Legal Defense Association, and we'll find out why he's
concerned about Goals 2000 and what defense strategies he's using
to combat government control of education here in Virginia and
nationwide.
<P>
 [Commercial break.]
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  We're joined by Mike Farris, president of the Homeschool
Legal Defense Association.  Many political watchers may remember
him as the man that the entire Democratic Party ran against in
recent Virginia elections.
<P>
 Welcome, Mike.  Glad to have you here.
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Thank you.  Good to be with you.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  Thanks for coming.
<P>
 We were talking about some of the problems with education earlier,
and I know they drove you in a very powerful direction:  out of
the schools.
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Right.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  Tell me, why did your organization decide that
we need to go a completely different direction?
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Well, let's start with my family.  I was raised
in a public school family.  Not only did I go to public schools
myself; my dad was a public school principal.  In fact, I was
being prepared to be a lawyer for school districts.  My undergraduate
honors thesis was written under the tutelage of the state school
board's attorney.
<P>
 Someplace along the line, I figured out that the philosophy that
had taken over the education system was antithetical to the Christian
values that I believe in.  So we decided, first of all, for Christian
schools for our oldest daughter in kindergarten and first grade,
and then we heard about homeschooling and we decided to try that
14 years ago, and that is kind of a similar story -- change the
facts a little bit, but the themes are the same -- and there are
about 400,000 families homeschooling their kids today.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  And Goals 2000, did that exacerbate the numbers
of people going one direction or the other?  I mean, what are
you seeing in terms of educational trends today?
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Well, homeschooling is growing at a very rapid rate.
 Private schools are growing at a rapid rate.  Goals 2000 helps
the growth of the private school and homeschool movement.  Frankly,
the thing that helped it the most was the election of Bill Clinton.
 Within about three months after Bill Clinton's election, we saw
the most phenomenal growth rate ever in membership of the Homeschool
Legal Defense Association.
<P>
 So I think that that is -- people's uncertainty about their government
is translated to uncertainty about schools.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  In terms of the government, the Family Research
Council, under Jennifer's excellent assistance, and Bill, and
Bob Morrison, put together this brochure, Let Freedom Ring, which
took a look at the national history standards.  And it was amazing
to see what they left out, everything from Thomas Edison to the
man on the moon, as you saw earlier.
<P>
 Jennifer, you have been taking a look at what has been happening
in schools.  What kinds of voids are you seeing?  Do you agree
with the voids that Mike is describing?
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  Yes, and the national history standards show a
direction, a very negative direction, in which public education
is going.  We produced this document with five staff over a course
of five weeks with a couple thousand dollars.  It took the Federal
Government $2 million, over two years, and a panel of probably
hundreds of experts to come up with the anti-American product
that they put out last year.
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  Yes, I think it needs to be pointed out here that
not only did they overlook some of the folks that you mentioned,
but they did in fact find a way to include Madonna and the Simpsons.
<P>
 [Laughter.]
<P>
 So, somehow, somewhere, the priorities were out of whack.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  In terms of Mike's organization, recently I was
at a hearing where this whole piece of data came up that the larger
the family, the less intelligent the children at the end; that
somehow large families and homes break down when it gets to numbers.
<P>
 But we were talking about education earlier, Bill, and you saw
a whole different trend and in fact wrote about that recently
in an Op-Ed.  What did you see?
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  Yes, this has been a common theme in education research,
and it is confirmed by a new study that's out in just this month's
American Sociological Association Journal, which shows, just as
you said, the larger the family size, the poorer the educational
performance, supposedly.
<P>
 The key thing to remember, though, is this:  that some research
that has recently been done at the University of Michigan refutes
these findings in some very interesting ways.  What the University
of Michigan researchers did was they looked at some Vietnamese
boat children, some kids who had come over as refugees after the
events in the 1970s in Vietnam, and they saw that these kids were
doing amazingly well in the public school system.
<P>
 They began to ask, why is it that these kids are doing so much
better than many of their peers?  And they went and looked at
the dynamics taking place in the home and found that even though
these kids were coming from larger families, even though their
parents really could not speak much English, these kids were doing
exceptionally well; and part of the reason was because there was
something akin to the old one-room schoolhouse effect taking place.
 That is, after the kids would eat dinner, they would clear off
the dining room table.  The older children would tutor the younger
children, which would have the effect of reinforcing some of the
things that they were learning as well as transmitting new information
to the younger children.
<P>
 What that study showed is that if you think of children as kind
of educational consumers alone who are drawing upon their parents'
resources, one can easily imagine where this theory that the larger
the family size, the poorer the kids do in school comes from,
because they are all then in a sense competing with one another
for their parents' attention and resources.
<P>
 But if, instead, these older children end up serving in a sense
as educational producers who are contributing to the educational
environment in the home and making it a richer environment, then,
all of a sudden, everyone does better, and in a sense a rising
tide lifts all boats.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  Mike, you've got to be seeing this kind of thing
if you look at homeschooling.  Just today I was reading in the
paper that we are seeing the data across the board that homeschooled
children test better.  What do you see as you are looking at homeschools,
children working together, families working together?  What does
the data show in your people?
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Homeschoolers score 20 to 30 percentile points higher
than the public schools.  And so I would be happy to match any
ninth-born homeschooler with any firstborn public schooler any
day.
<P>
 [Laughter.]
<P>
 You can jimmy numbers any way you want, but the reality is my
ninth-born child is a smart little kid, and I have no doubts that
he is going to do just fine, and that he is enriched by the large
family.  And, frankly, if you control for some socioeconomic factors,
then I think that it is a complete explanation of these what I
would consider to be phony studies.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  In terms of homeschooling, you have had a tough
time, though, despite the growing prominence, sometimes getting
that even legal, and there have been a lot of attacks.  I am sure
we all remember H.R. 6.  What kinds of attacks are coming against
efforts to look at other educational options for families?
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Well, the establishment doesn't like anybody that,
A, pulls out of the system, and, B, does a better job.  The consequential
embarrassment that comes to them causes some retribution at times.
<P>
 But the battles have changed.  We have been defending homeschoolers
for 13 years now.  Initially, it was a total ban on homeschooling.
 It's a little more sophisticated than that now, and they usually
don't try to do a total ban, but the battles are still there.
<P>
 We had a situation in Kansas within this last three or four months
where a judge held that homeschooling was illegal.  We appealed
that and got that reversed.  The more common problem is really
social services agencies that -- like a case we have in Sacramento
right now.  There were three allegations against a family.  One
was that they were very religious; secondly, that they were homeschooling;
and, third is they heard a child say, &quot;No, Daddy, no.&quot;
 And based on those three facts and those three facts alone, they
busted down the door and did a strip-search of the children.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  That is amazing.
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  And so, of course, we are suing those people in
Federal District Court.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  Even that your organization, Legal Defense Association,
that we have to do that.
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  You know, one of the things Mike's comments reminded
me of is that even though we do see the system out there quite
often harassing homeschoolers, one of the things that was rather
interesting to me as I began pulling together some of this recent
research is that there are several very prominent school teachers
who have been in the public school system, or are currently in
the system, who are saying, &quot;You know, there's something
going on over there that we really ought to take notice of.&quot;
<P>
 I know a recent teacher who was just named Teacher of the Year
in New York City made comments of this kind, and a Seattle public
school teacher has written a book about homeschooling and talks
about how, in many ways, the homeschool environment offers what
public school teachers have for many years been advocating in
terms of teacher-student ratio and things of that nature.
<P>
 And so it may be that, at least among some school teachers, we
are seeing a change in attitude that is quite promising for years
to come.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  I thought it was interesting, in Massachusetts,
before public schools, 98 percent of the children were literate;
after public schools, it has always been a 6 percent drop and
never been that high.
<P>
 What do you think?  I think the fear that people have to have,
Mike, is that I don't want my children in public schools, but
can I really be a teacher?  How do you address that kind of concern,
if I say, &quot;Look, I'm concerned about national history standards;
I don't know if I can actually do a better job&quot;?
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Anyone who wants to homeschool can.  If you can
read and are basically literate yourself, you can homeschool your
kids.  Now, if you can't, you need to learn to read.  Somebody
who can't do basic math and cannot function at high-school-level
reading should not be trying to attempt this.  But for anybody
who meets those basic criteria, if you're willing to work hard,
you can do a very successful job.
<P>
 People imagine themselves trying to conduct a schoolroom.  Well,
you don't have to conduct a schoolroom.  Homeschooling is a much
different form of academic instruction, and it is easier in a
sense because you're not having group dynamics going on where
you're having to teach to the middle and trying to worry about
these; you're just teaching to one child.  It is much more efficient,
academically better, just all around is a very successful way
to produce a good education for your kids.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  I think some people see the homeschoolers as people
trying to go outside of the system, maybe an Amish thing, in a
way.  Do you see that?  Because, frankly, in the terms of your
name coming up in the news, it would seem like in some ways you
get more involved in the politics of education rather than less.
<P>
 How do you talk to people who say, &quot;If I go the homeschool
route, then I'm kind of missing out on part of my culture?&quot;
 Because you're certainly here in Washington today for many reasons.
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Well, my own belief -- and it may be a little bit
biased -- is that the most effective, most well-organized political
network in the country is the homeschoolers.  There's nothing
as good.  And people are very, very activist, and the reason is,
they've seen their freedoms directly threatened in their own life,
something that's core to their day-to-day existence; and trying
to motivate other people to get involved is much more difficult,
because it's an abstraction to them.  But homeschoolers have lived
the battles of freedom.
<P>
 What I am really excited about for the long range is the couple
of million kids that are being homeschooled that have had to personally
observe and be involved in the battles for freedom.  The leadership
potential among those kids is enormous, and I think that we're
going to see some great things.  If our generation can just hold
on by our fingernails for about another dozen years or so, my
view is that probably a quarter or a third of Congress will be
homeschool graduates within 20 years.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  That will be fascinating.
<P>
 Bill, politically speaking, in the poll -- Family Research Council
does a lot of original polling -- in the poll last year, you took
a look at who is the constituency for a pro-educational-choice
way of viewing government.  Tell me, we found some interesting,
different demographics on that.
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  Yes, we really did, because, like many others, we
were measuring the level of support for things like providing
parents opportunities outside of the public school system and
things of that nature, but -- 
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  We're going to have to hear more about that in
a second.  We're going to go to break.  We're going to be right
back with more on educational choice, or maybe you don't have
educational choice.  Please come back.  Thanks.
<P>
 [Commercial break.]
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  It was an exciting day on Capitol Hill today, in
fact a very historic vote.  The partial-birth abortion ban passed
in the House.  This was a long-fought and a very hard-fought bill
that we have been working on for a long time to preserve the lives
of children killed at the very end of the pregnancy, late-term
abortions beginning at five months through the moment of birth.
<P>
 Unfortunately, however, Congressman Joe Scarborough, who was
going to join us, could not be here, but we are happy to have
had his vote on the Hill.
<P>
 Mike, I know that one thing that you and the Congressman are
looking at is the elimination of the Department of Education.
 It is very exciting.  It is the kind of thing that we've been
talking about since 1980.  But why are we still talking about
it today?
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Well, we're talking about it because the moderates
in the Republican Party convinced President
<P>
Reagan to table the idea of eliminating the Department of Education,
and frankly, they were wrong.  What has happened to education
since the Federal Government has gotten involved has been abysmal.
 Take any measure of education you want.  Academic achievement
is down.  In fact, it is so bad now that the most recent National
Assessment of Educational Progress scores are only a quarter of
the eighth graders can do math, and only a quarter of the fourth
graders can read at the level of proficiency on both of those
statistics.  And out of every new dollar that has been spent on
education since 1972, 76 cents has gone to administrative costs
and overhead, and only 24 cents has gone to teachers.
<P>
 It's nuts.  It is a crazy, centralized, drunk system.   They're
drunk with bureaucracy.  And every new reform proposal, the only
thing you can say about it is it requires a centralized bureaucracy
to run it.  Other than that, it is just a new five-year plan like
the Soviets brought out.  Every three-and-a-half years, just like
the Soviets, they know that they fail after a while,  And so it
is time to just abolish the system and go back to local control
of schools.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  The issue in some ways is how to do that.  You
know, I think some people have a fear that educational systems
are going to be abolished, or somehow property taxes will go away
and we'll have more money and no schools.
<P>
 But certainly Michigan, which decided to be revolutionary, has
done some exciting things.  What do you think about what's happening
in Michigan?  And maybe you could tell people about it.
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Well, I don't know that much about the details of
the Michigan program.  I just am proud of Governor Engler's general
efforts.  I have a general knowledge of it, and I think that he
has done a good job in showing that you can do things in a completely
different way and make a difference.
<P>
 Now, the impact on a local school district is that about 6 percent
of an average school district's budget comes from federal funds.
 The smarter thing is just not send that money to Washington in
the first place.  So the proposal that Jennifer and I and others
have been working on for several months now is to stop spending
the $70 billion we spend at the federal level and, instead, have
a $70 billion tax cut.  Just leave the money in the locale to
begin with and let the local people figure out how to spend it.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  See, what's so ironic about that is, there was
a survey done recently that the majority of public school teachers
had their children in private school.  We have our President with
his daughter in a private religious school, our Vice President
with his children in private religious school.  And what is funny
is private options are becoming sort of the thing that wealthier
Americans have, and some people are a little intimidated by homeschoolers,
and so people, for lack of financial resources -- which are going
to Washington in taxes -- end up in the hands of the bureaucracy.
<P>
 I mean, Bill, I know that that is a thing that you have been
concerned about.
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  Well, it really does gall me as one who used to
live here in the District of Columbia and had my daughter in the
public school system here, and I can well remember those kids
that she went to school with that were part of her classroom.
<P>
 You know, when Bill Clinton came to town and walked down Georgia
Avenue and tried to identify with the people that lived there,
and yet then the next week was enrolling his child in a private
school that not one of them could possibly afford, it really did
strike me as very hypocritical.
<P>
 My hope is that we can see reform not just here in the District
of Columbia but throughout the country, so that families that
are far less fortunate than the Clintons or the Gores will enjoy
the kinds of options that they now have.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  And what was ironic about that in terms of the
dollar thing is that, as I understand it, the amount that we spend
per child in the District of Columbia is the highest of any in
the Nation.
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  Oh, it's extraordinary.  Its extraordinary.  I mean,
if you gave parents that kind of money to do with what Mike's
parents do, it's amazing the kinds of things that they could have
afforded or the kinds of private school options that parents could
avail themselves of.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  But, Jennifer, so you're not a homeschooler.  So
why should we care?  You know, what is it that you're finding
as an education policy analyst that would indicate that everyone
needs to really be in favor of the things that Mike is doing?
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  Well, at Family Research Council, we refer to
homeschoolers as pioneers of freedom, because they're defending
freedoms for us all.  We are all going to be better in America
because they are standing up and defending our freedoms.
<P>
 I would like to point out, too, about Mr. Clinton's great idea,
grand plan for local control of education, which he has called
Goals 2000, in that first year of funding, only 50 percent, less
than 50 percent, of the money makes it back down to the local
level.  That is not local control, by any stretch of the definition.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  In terms of local control, I think it is always
interesting that, annually, People for the American Way comes
out with a report, &quot;Attacks on the Freedom to Learn,&quot;
which could be as simple as a parent called a school saying, &quot;I'm
concerned about a book.&quot;  And this isn't democracy; this
is an attack on the freedom to learn.
<P>
 What kinds of ridiculous attacks are you seeing out there, Mike?
 And I know the &quot;censorship&quot; word gets thrown around
everywhere, and you're on the front lines of that.
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  I just don't take the People for the American Way
very seriously.  Any group that comes into being for the sole
purpose of saying born-again Christians don't have the right to
participate in politics just doesn't deserve to be called a civil
organization, much less a civil rights organization.
<P>
 Think of it.  What would people say if they would have come into
existence to say, &quot;We don't think Jews should be involved
in politics,&quot; or, &quot;We don't think that Lutherans or
Muslims or some other group&quot; -- apparently, it is okay to
say that evangelical Christians shouldn't be involved in politics,
but nobody else.  It is a patently ridiculous organization, and
I don't think that they have much of importance to say, period.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  As we get ready to close this segment of our show,
what one last thing would you like parents to know about homeschooling
or about their concern for education today?
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Well, I think homeschooling works very well, and
our desire simply is to be left alone, and I hope that that is
the desire of every parent, that they want to be left alone by
the Federal Government and allowed to run their schools.  Whatever
school they choose for themselves, whether it is public school
or private school or home school, they need to be left alone and
allowed to pursue excellence.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  I would like to thank Mike and our guests for their
insight and for giving us the hope that parents maybe some day
will have the opportunity to influence their children's education.
<P>
 Stay tuned; there is more to come.  Thanks for watching.
<P>
 [Commercial break.]
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  The Family Research Council staff works diligently
through a variety of means to defend and uphold the family in
government and culture.  Take a look at our efforts recently on
your behalf from the home front.

 [From Christian Coalition &quot;Road to Victory&quot; Appearance,
September 8, 1995]:
<P>
 MR. BAUER:  I remember, a month or so ago, being in a hotel a
few blocks from here, sitting in a hotel room with Dan Rather
as we did two hours of interviews.  And during those interviews,
Dan Rather at one point leaned over to me and, I thought, in a
very real way, not just rhetorically, looked at me and said, &quot;Gary,
just what is it that you people want, anyway?&quot;
<P>
 I said, &quot;Well, you know, Dan, I would like to live in a
country where my daughters can go out on a date at night and I
don't have to worry about date rape.  Or my wife can take a walk
through the park a few blocks from our house and not feel that
she has to carry a can of mace with her.  I would like a country
where we wouldn't have to have bars on our windows, whether we
live in the inner city or live in the suburbs.
<P>
 &quot;I would like a country where women have economic opportunity.
 I've got two daughters.  Why wouldn't I want that?  But I also
want an America where, if my daughters decide to be a mother or
a homemaker, that that decision will be held up and honored as
something noble and good and decent.&quot;
<P>
 [Applause.]
<P>
 I told him I wanted a country that rejected racism, the racism
of Fuhrmann in Los Angeles and the racism of quotas and set-asides
and all those programs, a country where we actually taught all
of our children -- black, white, and Hispanic -- to judge others
by the content of their character and not the color of their skin.
<P>
 I told him I wanted a country that believed in the sanctity of
life again, that looked at drive-by shootings or 1.5 million abortions
a year and knew that those things were a tragedy.
<P>
 I want to be in a country where, when people play by the rules
and work hard and save and do the right things in their homes,
they actually win at the end of the day, and they're not treated
like suckers.
<P>
 I want a country that takes virtue seriously again, a country
where children aren't crying themselves to sleep at night because
there are no fathers there to comfort them or because their bodies
have been racked by venereal disease or exploited by pornography.
<P>
 In short, I told Dan Rather than I wanted a shining city upon
a hill, the place that our founders promised us.
<P>
 And as I said those things, I watched Dan Rather nod his head
up and down.  He was agreeing with me; the body language was clear.
 When I was finished, he looked at me, and he said, &quot;Gary,
that was an eloquent answer.  I've never heard anybody quite put
it that clearly.&quot;
<P>
 [Laughter.]
<P>
 And, of course, last night, if you watched that special, not
one second of that answer made it into the final show.
<P>
 You know, my friends, I think Dan Rather understood, and I think
the folks at CBS also understand, that if they actually ever really
tell the American people what we want, that the American people
will join with us in one voice and we will win.
<P>
 [Applause.]
<P>
 [From Testimony by Cathy Cleaver, FRC Director of Legal Policy,
before the Senate Judiciary Committee on October 25, 1995]:
<P>
 MS. CLEAVER:  Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, on behalf
of Gary Bauer and the Family Research Council, I want to express
our sincere appreciation for the opportunity to address this distinguished
committee on the critical issue of religious liberty.
<P>
 The First Amendment is not internally inconsistent.  The Establishment
Clause was designed to prevent the state from coercing our religious
belief.  The Free Exercise Clause was designed to prevent the
state from interfering with the exercise of religious beliefs.
 Thus, the religion clauses were designed to work hand in hand
to promote government neutrality with regard to religion.
<P>
 In the last several decades, however, the Supreme Court has wrongly
interpreted the clauses to be antagonistic to each other.  The
Court has created a false conflict between the religion clauses,
which must be reconciled in each case.
<P>
 I will attempt to explain our preference for a constitutional
amendment rather than a federal statute and address certain specific
concerns that have been raised in the public debate.
<P>
 The Family Research Council supports an amendment to the Constitution
clarifying the First Amendment's prohibition of discrimination
against religious expression and against persons, groups, or organizations
in access to government benefits or protections on account of
the religious character of their speech or identity.
<P>
 We do not favor changing the First Amendment in any way.  Rather,
we support an amendment which would correct the Supreme Court's
misinterpretation of the First Amendment.
<P>
 Several concerns and questions have been raised about this approach.
 Is this radical approach really necessary?  First, it is wise
to keep from confusing procedure with substance.  Amending the
Constitution is a radical procedure, to be sure.  Article V of
the Constitution ensures that it is not to be achieved without
effort and consensus.  Yet the substance of a restorative religious
liberty amendment need not be radical in nature.
<P>
 Legal experts and numerous interested groups have examined potential
approaches for months, and the Family Research Council remains
willing to continue to discuss specific language for such an amendment.
 We are especially eager to hear your specific ideas, Mr. Chairman,
and those of Congressman Hyde.
<P>
 In closing, this principle of neutrality is not new.  It is the
aim and result of our First Amendment's religion clauses, properly
understood.  A religious liberty amendment could restore the saving
principle so that our First Amendment would not be used to promote
the empty state religion of secularism but to promote true freedom
and the prospect of freedom's fulfillment in truth, to which every
American is entitled.
<P>
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
<P>
 SENATOR HATCH:  Thank you, Ms. Cleaver.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  I will be right back for some closing thoughts.
 Stay tuned.

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight
Talk</i> from the Family Research Council.  We're thrilled to have
made it through our first show last week, and we are looking forward
to an exciting season ahead.  In our many weeks to come, <i>Straight
Talk</i> will be addressing issues that are critical to today's families,
which is really what the Family Research Council is all about.
 Working hand in hand with government policies are cultural issues
that affect those policies.
<p>
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i> we will be
sharing an investigation into what our society views as typical
sexual behavior, based on the studies and published works of Dr.
Alfred Kinsey, his studies known worldwide as the Kinsey report.
<p>
Within our show, we will be airing an exclusive video production
in full called <i>The Children of Table 34</i>.  This video asks, and
attempts to answer, some of the questions first investigated by
Dr. Judith Reisman, who examined the Kinsey data on child sexuality.
 Dr. Reisman cites clear evidence that children were either sexually
abused by adults for scientific studies or somebody lied about
the data.
<p>
This shocking revelation strikes at the core of society's
current sex ideologies, which have solely shaped sex and health
education curriculum; and the funding came even perhaps from our
own government.
<p>
So the Family Research Council decided to get
the word out, let people know that their tax dollars are funding
programs that are based on unscientific research.  Viewer discretion
and parental guidance are therefore strongly advised in viewing
tonight's show.
<p>
But, first, let's hear from Gary Bauer, president
of the Family Research Council.  Gary is quoted weekly in the
nation's newspapers, and makers from all kinds of news programs
call him.  In fact, today you may hear him talking about Colin
Powell.  This is his opportunity to share with you what you might
not hear from journalists and broadcasters.  Join me and Gary
Bauer as we talk about the stories that lie behind the headlines.

<p>
It is Tuesday morning,
and I am here with Gary Bauer, president of the Family Research
Council.  Most of political America, Gary, is watching the elections,
some pivotal ones in Kentucky and Virginia.  As we watch early
returns in what some are calling a referendum on the GOP and the
conservative pro-family movement, what do you see in this election
cycle?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  You know, Kristi, our viewers have us at a
disadvantage:  We are taping this while people vote, and our viewers
will know the outcome of the elections by the time they see us
talking about them.
<p>
But my sense is that whatever happened in
these elections around the country -- in Virginia, New Jersey,
I guess Kentucky, and Mississippi -- you can't cover up what the
overall trend in the country is.
<p>
I suspect conservatives are going
to do well and that our viewers already know that.  But even if
they don't, the fact of the matter is the trend line around the
country is unbelievably in a conservative direction.  And even
in these elections, the Democrats running around the country were
running as conservatives.  They were trying to act like they were
fiscal conservatives, economic conservatives.  They were not talking
about social issues because they know those issues are hurting
them.
<p>
So the untold story is that the Democratic Party and liberalism
around the country is demoralized.  You've got people switching
parties.  I think we'll have three more House members switch before
the end of the year.  State legislatures that have never been
Republican have gone into Republican control in the last few months
as special elections have been held.
<p>
So there is a strong conservative
tide running in the country.  I hope it continued today, but even
if there were some bumps in the road, I think that tide is going
to run for a while.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Some of the different interest
groups have said that an anti-American sentiment has been moving
away from being in favor of any referendum, tax increases of any
kinds.  Do you agree with that?  Because certainly there are all
kinds of tax-increasing referenda on the ballots.
<p>
MR. BAUER: Yes.  I think people will vote for referenda when the issue is
the right issue.  The critics are right about taxes, however.
 Just about anyplace in the country that there is a tax bond measure
or referendum on the ballot, people are saying no.
<p>
I mean, here in Northern Virginia, which is, of course, peculiar to this 
one area, but it really is very similar to a lot of places in the
rest of the country.  You've got state taxes, local taxes.  The
federal tax rate went up in the beginning of the Clinton Administration.
 There is a particular gross receipts tax in Northern Virginia
that has driven a lot of small businesses literally out of business.
<p>
Americans remain deeply overtaxed, and I hope that's an issue
that the Republican Party will continue to emphasize and run with
in 1996, because I think it brings millions of voters to the banner.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  When it comes to fear tactics in Washington right
now, some of the worst language is reserved for Medicare and the
Medicare vote.  Gary, you have been watching this for a while.
 Why do you think the Medicare debate needs to go forward? 
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, we believe that that program, which is a valuable
program to many elderly, has to be reformed, and it has to be
reformed to save it.  If you take the current trends in place
and let those trends continue another 20, 25 years, what you have
is a Medicare program that literally would be consuming almost
all of the revenue of the Federal Government.
<p>
Well, obviously,
we can't have that.  That's not going to work.  So we've got to
come up with a way to get costs under control, to save the program
for people like my 75-year-old mother who relies on it and many
of the other elderly who have come to rely on it.
<p>
I think it has
been disgusting to see some of the politicians use scare rhetoric
and harsh rhetoric to try to bamboozle, quite frankly, senior
citizens into thinking that their benefits are going to be taken
away and that they're going to be left without medical care. 
That's a disgusting thing to do to elderly people who already
worry about the future, and I think the politicians who engaged
in that are going to suffer for it at the polls next year. 
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  One of the most historic things in this last week has
been the partial-birth abortion ban vote in the House and, we
think, this week in the Senate.  What do you think, Gary, has
brought us to the point where we can see this kind of historic
pro-life vote?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  The problem on the abortion issue has
always been getting facts to the American people.  If you get
them facts, then the votes tend to come out pro-life.  We saw
that in the House of Representatives.  When the Congress had to
actually focus on the facts of what a partial-birth abortion is,
most of them were so horrified by the procedure that they voted
to ban it.
<p>
I think the final vote, at least the vote in favor
of the ban, was 288 votes.  That's a bigger consensus than a lot
of the economic agenda that the Republicans are pushing.  So I
think it was a very historic vote and probably the beginning of
a number of votes in the Congress that will, I think, educate
the American people.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Gary, thank you so much for
being with us, and we'll look forward to talking to you next week.
 Good night.
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Thank you.  Good to be with you, Kristi.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  When <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>
returns, we will speak to Bob Knight, who wrote, produced, directed,
and edited the 1994 documentary, <i>The Children of Table 34</i>.  Bob
will explain the importance of uncovering Dr. Alfred Kinsey's
unorthodox and unscientific study of child sexuality.  Stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk
from the Family Research Council</i>.  Tonight we are talking to Bob
Knight, Director of Cultural Studies at the Family Research Council.
 Bob daily examines cutting-edge social issues that affect and
are affected by cultural values.  He will be introducing one of
his most recent and possibly one of the most shocking issues he
has encountered.
<p>
Bob, welcome to <i>Straight Talk</i>.  Appreciate you
being here.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Thanks for having me, Kristi.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You were a journalist at the Los Angeles Times, got involved
at the Heritage Foundation on cultural issues.  You have a long
history of looking at the things that really have changed America.
<p>
What drew your attention to this particular topic?  Family Research
Council hasn't done any other videos.  You're the first.  What
caught your eye?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Well, it really began about five
years ago when I was doing research on federal funding for all
sorts of cultural projects, and I kept running into Kinsey, the
name Kinsey, the references to Kinsey.
<p>
I talked to a number of
people, including Dr. Judith Reisman, who had been investigating
Kinsey since 1981, and she revealed in a 1990 book, Kinsey, Sex
and Fraud, that some of the very basis for what we now regard
as gospel in sex education and sexology came out of experiments
on children in the 1940s under the rubric of science; and she
made the charge that it's either fraud or criminal exploitation
of children, but either way, we shouldn't be basing our idea of
normal sexuality on it.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I was interested in reading
some of the literature that you had written.  I mean, in terms
of attitudes about sex that have come from Kinsey, it has been
everything from 10 percent of the population is homosexual, which
was a project that you worked on; and showing that that was not
true -- it was really 1, at most 2 percent -- but even the data
that says men mature sexually at 18 and women, at 30, that data
all comes from Kinsey as well, correct?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  It does.
 Kinsey is the motherlode of information on the sex issues.  Kinsey
formulated what he called the Kinsey scale, which is a scale from
zero to 6.  Zero is heterosexuality; 6 is homosexuality.  Notice
he puts the norm at the bottom.  And he actually said that only
4 percent of the population constitute either end of the spectrum,
and everybody else is bisexual.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That's amazing.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  So he used this and, by the way, developed this before
he did 95 percent of his research -- it just came out of his head
-- and he used this to push the idea of outlet sex, which makes
all sexual acts equal morally, whether it is between husband and
wife or any other combination, in or out of marriage.
<p>
This was a moral leveling force that Hugh Hefner picked up with his 
playboy philosophy, and it became the grounding for the 
if-it-feels-good-do-it generation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, this video which we're going to
see does go into greater detail, but the thing that is compelling
-- you know, today there's a lot of stories -- oh, a priest who
molested children 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago --
there have been stories that have come from terrible sexual acts
of the past.  But what is powerful about this is that it's not
really just the past, is it, Bob?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  No, it's the guiding
force of most sex education today.  Kinsey is the only sexual
data on children we have because, after all, it's criminal to
exploit children in this fashion.
<p>
So what the Kinsey people did
was take this data from molestation of children and extrapolate
it into a philosophy that said, &quot;Hey, kids are not only viable
sexually, but they're entitled to it.&quot;  And, if you notice,
the history of sex education is to bring sex ed, graphic materials,
to children at earlier and earlier ages, because, after all, science
says they are sexual beings.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I know people have
got to be watching and saying, &quot;Are you really saying children
were molested?&quot;  And we are going to get into that in just
a little bit.
<p>
But, frankly, what has been interesting is the lack
of interest in discussing it.  Have you found that shocking as
you have tried to present this information?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  This has been a hard sell -- and, I think, for one reason:  
It strikes at the very heart of the sexual revolution, because Alfred Kinsey
is the most quoted sexologist in history.  What he said undergirds
most current if-it-feels-good philosophy.  And they sense the
danger here.  If you discredit Alfred Kinsey, a lot falls down
with him.
<p>
So we think that people instinctively who feel that
sex ought to be free and wild and there ought to be no structures
sense that this could be very bad for them if it gets out.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What is one fast thing people need to know before we
unveil <i>The Children of Table 34</i>?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Well, I wouldn't have any children in the room.  You know, some 
of the material is shocking.  We did it as tastefully as we could, and there's
really nothing obscene or anything.  But it's shocking.  It's
hard stuff to digest, and you don't want children around.
<p>
The only other thing is that we took three years to document this
and make sure everything is absolutely accurate.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: There is a lot of information there to see. When <i>Straight 
Talk</i> returns, we'll take a look at what Bob has investigated and the
revelations that he has discovered as we bring to you <i>The Children
of Table 34</i>.  Again, viewer discretion and parental guidance is
strongly advised, not because of the material you will see, but
just the ideas are very powerful.  Stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're back with <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i>.  Tonight's unique show includes the extraordinary documentary,
<i>The Children of Table 34</i>.  This documentary asks key questions
of Dr. Alfred Kinsey's child sexual studies.  Was consent obtained
from parents or guardians of those children who were sexually
molested in the name of science? <i>Straight Talk</i> now presents <i>The
Children of Table 34</i>.
<p>
<center><h3>The Children of Table 34</h3></center>
<p>
MR. ZIMBALIST:  Hello.  I'm Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.  A number of
years ago, I starred in The Chapman Report, a film about the sex
studies of Dr. Alfred Kinsey.
<p>
Like most Americans, I felt at the
time that Dr. Kinsey's work was groundbreaking, and it was.  But
since then, serious questions have been raised about the Kinsey
research methods, serious enough to warrant a closer look.
<p>
What would you think if you learned that some of the most important
scientific research of the century may have been based on fraud,
or, if not fraud, criminal experimentation on children, funded
by the taxpayer?
<p>
What if you learned that the results of this
research are exerting a profound influence on our society today,
ranging from how we deal with sex offenders to how, when, and
what our children are being taught about sex, not to mention why.
<p>
Every parent in America needs to know the facts behind Alfred
Kinsey's inclusion of children in his famous sex studies in the
late 1940s.  Recent revelations about government-sponsored radiation
experiments remind us once more of the dangers of projects that
violate informed consent and the standards of common decency.
<p>
As you watch this story unfold, you will learn how America has
unknowingly put its children at risk in the name of science. 
And you may also join me in asking, What happened to Dr. Kinsey's
smallest subjects?  Where are the children of Table 34?
<p>
NARRATOR: Children, our most precious gift and our hope for the future.
 Once upon a time, children were free to roam their neighborhoods
without worry.  Parents could count on the good intentions of
neighbors, school officials, and other adults to keep their children
safe.  But in recent years, parents have had to take special measures
to ensure that their children not come to harm.  Their fears are
not unfounded.  Many children have fallen victim to sexual abuse.
<p>
How did we go from a safe, caring environment for children to
one in which parents are terrified that their children are at
risk in just a few short years?  Part of the answer may be found
in Indiana, at the world-famous Kinsey Institute.
<p>
In 1948, a zoologist
named Alfred C. Kinsey shocked the world with his pioneering study,
<i>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</i>. Although many scientists were
critical of Kinsey's methods, the media popularized Kinsey's findings
about sex.
<p>
By 1981, Dr. Judith Reisman uncovered the role of child
sexual abuse in the Kinsey studies in a paper presented to the
Fifth World Congress of Sexology in Jerusalem.  She documented
Kinsey's reliance on the systematic molestation of more than 300
infants and children from 2 months old to 15 years of age.  Graph
tables depicting sexual activity in children use identical criteria
as those in the tables on adult subjects.
<p>
DR. REISMAN:  Then I went back and I took a look at the Kinsey report, 
<i>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</i>, and as I reviewed the tables, 
it struck me as clear as day.  How could they get this data?  Where would they
get these data?  How did they know that a 2-month-old baby did
or did not have an orgasm?  How did they get a record of 26 orgasms
in 24 hours for a 4-year-old -- a 4-year-old?
<p>
MR. TRUEMAN:  If these experiments took place, they involved acts to which 
no child could provide consent and for which no parent or guardian could
provide consent on behalf of the child.  Therefore, we are talking
about criminal activity, the criminal sexual abuse of children.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Research scientist Gordon Muir sees broad ramifications
from Kinsey's work.  According to Dr. Muir, who helped edit and
publish Judith Reisman's and Ed Eichel's 1990 book, <i>Kinsey, Sex
and Fraud</i>:
<p>
DR. MUIR:  Children as young as 2 months of age are
featured in tables, in some cases 188 children in one table, and
the legend beneath the table says, &quot;Timed with a second hand
or stopwatch.&quot;
<p>
The understanding that we have of childhood
sexuality and normal childhood sexual development as it is believed
and taught in academia today comes from the experimental evidence
documented in Kinsey's male report published in 1948, with the
child sexuality tables that we have just discussed.  It is absolutely
astonishing that this is taken as the basis for what we understand
to be normal childhood sexual development.
<p>
When I try to explain
this to colleagues in the type of science that I am involved in
and what I call the harder sciences of biology and medicine, statistics,
immunology, they frankly do not believe what I am trying to tell
them, and the only way that I can convince them of the truth of
this is to go to the library, pull off the shelf one of Alfred
Kinsey's books, and show them what in fact is inside, and it is
quite shocking.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Based on the Kinsey data, six researchers
formulated a theory of child sexuality that has influenced everything
from laws against molestation to how and when sex education is
taught.
<p>
Few professionals would disagree that Dr. Kinsey has been
the most influential figure in the study of sex, particularly
the concept of child sexuality.
<p>
DR. MUIR:  He did not openly promote
pedophilia, but he provided the &quot;scientific&quot; basis
for it.  He felt the main problem with adult-child sexual relations
was hysteria and overreaction on the part of parents and authorities.
<p>
He believed that young boys needed the help of older people to
develop effective sexual techniques, and he recorded that adult
sexual contacts with young girls were a source of pleasure to
these girls and may lead to better sociosexual development in
their later lives.
<p>
His co-author, Wardell Pomeroy, a prominent
sexologist, has written that the Kinsey research uncovered &quot;many 
beautiful and mutually satisfying relationships between fathers
and daughters&quot;.
<p>
Pomeroy also, in his sex education book, <i>Boys and
Sex</i>, refers to the possibility of &quot;loving sexual relationships&quot;
between children and animals.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Children have been increasingly portrayed sexually in 
major pornographic magazines.
<p>
DR. REISMAN:  In our study conducted for the U.S. Justice Department,
particularly juvenile justice and delinquency prevention, we came
up with some pretty surprising findings on the images of children
in <i>Playboy</i> and <i>Penthouse</i> and <i>Hustler</i>.  In particular, 
<i>Playboy</i> and <i>Penthouse</i> were surprising to us.  We were 
instructed to do the research because of the finding of these kinds of 
materials being used in sexual activities, sexual crimes, really, against
children.
<p>
Most disturbing was that 29 percent of the visuals --
that is, the photographs -- included some sort of nude or genital
display -- very, very surprising.  Twenty-one percent were visually
exposed and sexualized.  Twenty percent had some sort of genital
activity taking place of some type.  Ten percent involved force;
10 percent, killing or murder.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Before Kinsey, psychologists
had rejected the idea of children as sexually viable until the
age of puberty.  Earlier this century, Sigmund Freud paved the
way for Kinsey by asserting that children were sexual but that
their sexuality was latent; that is, not acted upon until puberty.
<p>
Kinsey's report radically altered this perception, spawning an
entire industry based on the notion that children have a right
to sexual relations at any age.  The Kinsey perception of the
&quot;right&quot; of children to have sex at any age has resulted
in challenges to laws protecting children from sexual exploitation.
<p>
MR. SHAHEEN:  In Florida recently, a state court judge threw out
several cases that had been brought under the statutory rape laws.
 Citing privacy grounds, the judge found that minors under the
age of 16 had a constitutional right to engage in sexual activity.
<p>
Several courts have recently held that parents do not have a right
to stop school districts from handing out condoms to their children.
 Again, you see in school districts, in courts, in the media,
the Kinsey philosophy that children should be free and autonomous
to decide for themselves what sort of sexual activity, what sort
of sexual behavior they should engage in, without any kind of
regulation or restriction from the state or their parents, has
begun to chip away at the protections that our legal system had
previously provided to children.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Some scientists feel that an inquiry of the Kinsey 
Institute is long overdue.
<p>
DR. MUIR: I have been in contact with perhaps the best known fraud specialist
in this country over a period of years concerning this Kinsey
research fraud allegation.  The person I am referring to, of course,
is Walter Stewart(?), who is well known in Congress and in the
scientific community for his work in the Baltimore case, particularly,
and in other cases.  Now, Stewart is firmly of the opinion that
there is something here that needs to be investigated and has
told me so many times.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Muir says that such an effort
may be mounted outside the United States and cites a letter by
Walter Stewart to the Canadian Medical Journal.
<p>
DR. MUIR:  What Stewart said was that he finds the evidence -- that is, 
for fraud and ethical violations in research -- compelling, since the evidence
comes almost entire from Kinsey's book itself.  He says, &quot;I
find it disturbing and believe it requires investigation.&quot;
<p>
NARRATOR:  Dr. Muir says he hopes that Congress will investigate
the Kinsey Institute once it is widely known that children may
have been used in sexual experimentation.
<p>
DR. MUIR:  Because there
is a mess here that has to be cleared up in the backyard of American
science, and it would indeed be tragic if it gets cleared up from
elsewhere first.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Important questions need to be answered.
 Where are the children today?  How were they procured for the
experiments?  Did their parents know they were being used in sessions
with avowed pedophiles?  Where are the children of Table 34?
<p>
DR. COURT:  I am concerned about these people, who must now be in
their fifties, that they must have had some very difficult experiences
following these experiments, and it would be good, really, if
they could be contacted even for therapeutic purposes at this
stage.
<p>
I often wonder if they will come forward when we are speaking
in lectures or speaking on radio or whatever it may be.  I have
been waiting to hear, for some of these people to remember the
experience and to come forward and say, &quot;Yes, I was one of
those.&quot;
<p>
NARRATOR:  Based on 12,000 interviews, empirical
observation, and Kinsey's own ideas about sexuality, the Kinsey
report, as it came to be known, had enormous cultural and scientific
impact.
<p>
MR. GAGNON:  You could use the findings from the survey
to counter the moral judgments of other people, and that's really
the importance of Kinsey.  As Kinsey moves the argument away from
the old kind of sterile debate about morality -- in which, of
course, there is no solution -- to a place where people can start
talking about sexuality in a different kind of way, looking to
different kinds of standards.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Kinsey concluded that
Americans' sex lives were far more varied than had been thought
and that children were sexual from birth.  But the Kinsey books
have serious flaws, as has been noted by the National Research
Council and Dr. Abraham Maslow, who warned Kinsey that sex surveys
tend to skew the data toward the sexually promiscuous and unconventional.
<p>
Because sexual manipulation of children is illegal, the Kinsey
studies have served as virtually the sole source for sex researchers.
 The Kinsey findings about children are based on interviews with
and records kept by pedophiles, which he described as &quot;adult
males who've had sexual contacts with younger boys and who, with
their adult backgrounds, are able to recognize and interpret the
boys' experiences.&quot;
<p>
DR. MUIR:  As a practitioner, a psychologist,
I cannot see that this is the way in which we collect information
about normal childhood sexuality.  To get pedophiles to go out
and do experiments on children is not how we learn about normality.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Please stay tuned to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>.  Did the Kinsey Institute people pay pedophiles
to conduct their studies?  After the commercial break, we'll ask
this and other questions as we continue with more of <i>The Children
of Table 34</i>.
<p>
[Commercial break.] 
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i> is back.  As we continue to put Dr.
Alfred Kinsey's scientific sexual findings under a microscope,
the Family Research Council's 1994 documentary, which we share
with you tonight, reveals the fallacies Dr. Kinsey's study created.
 Amazingly, these fallacies shape sex and health education even
today. Now, more of <i>The Children of Table 34</i>:
<p>
NARRATOR:  Kinsey acknowledges that some of the experiments involved the 
use of physical force with unwilling participants.  Kinsey describes
what he terms &quot;orgasms&quot; by the children, &quot;. . .
a gradual and sometimes prolonged buildup to orgasm which involves
still more violent convulsions of the whole body, heavy breathing,
groaning, sobbing, or more violent cries, sometimes with an abundance
of tears (especially among young children).&quot;
<p>
&quot;Some of the children exhibited extreme trembling, collapse, loss of 
color, and sometimes fainting.  The males in the present group will fight
away from the partner and may make violent attempts to avoid climax,
although they derive definite pleasure from the situation.&quot;
<p>
&quot;A fretful babe quiets down under the initial sexual stimulation,
is distracted from other activities, begins rhythmic pelvic thrusts,
becomes tense as climax approaches, is thrown into convulsive
action, often with violent arm and leg movements, sometimes with
weeping at the moment of climax.&quot;
<p>
According to Paul Gebhart(?),
a Kinsey report coauthor and former president of the Kinsey Institute,
the researchers were aware that the experiments were illegal.
 &quot;We have always insisted on maintaining confidentiality,
even at the cost of thereby becoming amoral at best and criminal
at worst,&quot; said Gebhart.  &quot;An example of criminality
is our refusal to cooperate with authorities in apprehending a
pedophile we had interviewed who was being sought for a sex murder.&quot;
<p>
DR. POMEROY:  Kinsey would have done business with the devil if
it helped the research, and this is true.  The research was absolutely
paramount.  And he was astute enough to stay out of trouble. 
He got in practically no trouble, but he worked at it.
<p>
DR. MUIR: Related to that, of course, is the question, did parents give
consent to what was being done?  Nobody has indicated to us that
consent was given.  Indeed, these coworkers seemed to indicate
to us that consent was not given, and they didn't really see it
as terribly important, because this wasn't going to be particularly
harmful to the children, anyway.
<p>
NARRATOR:  There is another possibility
regarding Kinsey's data on children:  that the experiments never
took place.
<p>
DR. MUIR:  We have the other serious implication that
the data are being used as if they were real in order to generate
a whole view of child sexuality and availability of children in
sexual encounters which is based on nothing.
<p>
NARRATOR:  If that is so, then scientific fraud may have occurred.  
In either case, the reliance on reports on sexual torture of children under 
the auspices of federally supported research cries out for examination,
especially since Kinsey's research had such a profound effect
on the entire sex research field.
<p>
MR. EICHEL:  I went back to
get a degree and went into the human sexuality program at New
York University, and it was when I was in that program that I
began to learn and see the indoctrination of what has been called
the Kinsey grand scheme.
<p>
Now, that term comes from Wardell Pomeroy,
Kinsey's closest associate, but I experienced it firsthand in
an international health seminar held in Holland, organized by
my professor, Dr. Deryck Calderwood.
<p>
Calderwood initiated nude-body
workshops in which he would give quasi-medical excuses for men
to touch each other's genitals and for women to interact in different
feely-touchy situations.
<p>
NARRATOR:  The Kinsey Institute has dominated
the world of sexology through the migration of Kinsey disciples
to several key centers of sexology, including New York University,
the University of Pennsylvania, and the Institute for Advanced
Study of Human Sexuality in San Francisco.  These three institutions
account for the lion's share of the academic credentialing of
sex educators in the United States.
<p>
Working with the Kinsey team
was Dr. Mary Calderone, who was medical director of the Planned
Parenthood Federation of America from 1953 to 1964, before co-founding
the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States,
better known as SIECUS.
<p>
MR. EICHEL:  She formed that organization
with Lester Kirkendall, another pioneering sexologist, who was
the teacher and the mentor of Deryck Calderwood, my professor.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Also involved was Kinsey's co-author, Wardell Pomeroy,
a founding member who also served as president of SIECUS as recently
as 1975.
<p>
MR. EICHEL:  In terms of Lester Kirkendall, in 1985,
he made a statement in an article entitled &quot;Sex Education
in the Future&quot; that I think is worth noting.
<p>He says that
programs of the future will probe sexual expression with same-sex
partners and even across generational lines.  &quot;With a diminished
sense of guilt, these patterns will become legitimate, and the
emphasis on normality and abnormality will be much diminished
with these future trends.&quot;
<p>
NARRATOR:  The most obvious impact
of this effort is to demystify the taboos of sexuality in sex
education classes to very young children.  Many sex education
curricula now begin in kindergarten and continue through high
school, often under AIDS prevention.  The message to parents:
 If we don't begin teaching children about safe sex as early as
possible, including every variation, then they may get AIDS.
DR. REISMAN:  Mrs. Smith or Ms. Smith from somewhere in Ohio, who
goes for her three-unit training in human sexuality because she
has to teach human sexuality to the kids and she has to teach
AIDS prevention, she goes to an accredited sex educator, and she
will be trained in the Kinsey model.  That is the only model that
she can be trained in.
<p>
And as a result, then, she has to set aside
whatever value structure, whatever moral structure she has been
carrying all these years, because she has been told that the &quot;science&quot;
has proven that children are sexual from birth, that children
have orgasmic potential from birth, that this therefore can be
perfectly fine.
<p>
[From a Nickelodeon special]:
<p>
CHILD:  How can you be protected from AIDS, like when you're having sex? 
<p>
TEACHER:  Well, one of the best ways, Magic, is wear a condom,
isn't it?
<p>
MR. JOHNSON:  Yes.  The safest way is to wear a condom.
<p>
NARRATOR:  As a result, some schools, and even a documentary
presented by Nickelodeon, are instructing children as young as
8 years old in how to use a condom:
<p>
TEACHER:  You roll it
down the penis, and that protects the man when his penis is inside
the woman's vagina.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Children are also told how to perform
anal sex.  At a safe sex youth conference in New York in 1994,
children as young as 12 were given graphic brochures advising
boys to enjoy safe sex with men and encouraging girls to experiment
with lesbian sex practices that could cause sterility.
<p>
MR. EICHEL: Nowhere in the program curriculum that was developed to be the
guidelines for future sex education was there anything that suggested
sick sexual behavior, any form of sexual activity that might
be categorized, or abnormality.
<p>
NARRATOR:  The Kinsey view of
child sexuality has also been promulgated by Dr. John Money, perhaps
the most prominent sex researcher in America.  A founding board
member of SIECUS, Dr. Money has written numerous books, as well
as hundreds of papers, reviews, and textbook chapters on the subject
of sex.
<p>
In 1990, Dr. June Reinisch dedicated her book, <i>The Kinsey
Institute New Report on Sex</i>, to Dr. Money, whom she describes
as &quot;one of my mentors.&quot;
<p>
Recently, Dr. Money was interviewed
by Piedika(?), the journal of pedophilia, which is published in
The Netherlands.  The journal argues for man-boy sex and contains
advertisements for the North American Man-Boy Love Association
and other pro-pedophile groups.
<p>
Kinsey Institute associate Dr.
Vern Bulow(?) is on Piedika's editorial board, which issued this
statement of purpose:  &quot;The starting point of Piedika is
necessarily our consciousness of ourselves as pedophiles.&quot;
<p>
MR. EICHEL:  But when you look at the journal Piedika, the Dutch
journal, you will see that on the board of directors you have
people like Vern Bulow.  Vern Bulow was the president of the Society
for the Scientific Study of Sex when they formed the accrediting
committee for future university programs that give degrees to
sex educators.
<p>
Vern Bulow did the foreword for Edward Brongursma's(?)
two volumes, <i>Loving Boys</i>.  John Money of Johns Hopkins Hospital
and the mentor of June Reinisch was interviewed in Piedika, and
of course, he is one of the people saying that sex with children
can be an enriching experience and doesn't harm the child.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shares with you the 
conclusion of <i>The Children of Table 34</i> and more insights from the 
documentary's producer, Robert Knight.  Please stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i> now
brings you the conclusion of our 1994 documentary, which reveals
shocking findings about Dr. Alfred Kinsey's children of Table
34.  And immediately following, we will once again speak with
Robert Knight, producer of this chilling video.  Please watch.
<p>
NARRATOR:  In Dr. Money's interview in Piedeka, he was asked about
child sexuality.  His reply:  &quot;If I were to see the case
of a boy aged ten or twelve who is intensely attracted toward
a man in his twenties or thirties, if the relationship is totally
mutual and the bonding is genuinely totally mutual, then I would
not call it pathological in any way.&quot;
<p>
This attitude mirrors
that of Dr. Kinsey, who once wrote that, &quot;It is difficult
to understand why a child, except for its cultural conditioning,
should be disturbed at having its genitalia touched.&quot;
<p>
MR. ZIMBALIST:  In 1965, the Kinsey team published the book, <i>Sex 
Offenders</i>, which argued that sexual behavior was so varied that 
certain activities should not be singled out for harsh punishment.
<p>
During the past 10 years, reports of child abuse cases have soared to more 
than 2.5 million annually.  Although many of these cases have proved
to be false reports, it is clear that child abuse, and the perception
of child abuse, is a growing problem.  Increasingly, child abuse
experts are expressing concern about Kinsey's impact on the way
people view sexuality.
<p>
MR. EICHEL:  One of the objectives of Kinsey-type
programming is to change the concept of the family, and if you
think about it, if Heather has two mommies and Daddy has a male
roommate, in a way, you are denormalizing the heterosexual nuclear
family.  And if you remember from the pedophile-type statements
in the writings, for example, of Theo Sanford, he said that if
children could be weaned away from the nuclear family, they could
then form emotional attachments with others beyond the family.
<p>
So, in a sense, the systematic destruction of the concept of a
family with a mother and father, and with the family break-ups
and divorces that are occurring, it is a very opportune time.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Attempts to uncover evidence regarding the experiments
on children have been rebuffed by the Kinsey Institute.  Former
director Dr. June Reinisch, interim director Dr. Stephanie Sanders,
and other Kinsey personnel either declined or did not respond
to interview requests.  Dr. Money also declined to be interviewed.
<p>
<i>Child</i> magazine featured an article by Dr. Reinisch urging parents
to regard their children as sexually active and to promote more
sexual activity.
<p>
MR. ZIMBALIST:  Given its critical role in overhauling
a culture that used to value and protect children above all else,
the Kinsey report is long overdue for scientific scrutiny.
<p>
DR. MUIR:  He used data from the rape of children, as we've discussed,
some as young as 2 months, to demonstrate and prove childhood
sexual capacity.  He concealed the full nature of these experiments,
and he concealed information on who performed these experiments.
<p>
He extrapolated these data to describe normal childhood development.
 He did not follow up these abused children, as was ethically
and morally required, though the identities of many of these children
are known and known today, and they still could be followed up,
and should be.
<p>
Furthermore, he shielded criminals who were involved
in this work, including one murderer that we know of, from the
police.
<p>
If I have not said enough about the need for this research
to be investigated, then I doubt if there is really anything else
that could be said.
<p>
MR. ZIMBALIST:  These questions need to be
answered:  How were the children procured for the experiments
recorded in Table 34?  Where are they now?  Most would be in their
fifties.
<p>
Also, many of the Kinsey associates themselves are still
around, but most of them are elderly.  It is important that they
be given the opportunity to shed light on what happened before
it's too late, before any more children are victimized.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back. Bob, you produced this video.  You've been 
working on this project for years.  As a matter of fact, you were talking
about it the day that I met you, about four years ago, three or
four years ago.  It's a very powerful video.
<p>
But what does the Kinsey Institute say when they're asked about this 
horrendous research?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  I am glad you asked that, because they
have finally broken their silence on it.  Dr. John Bancroft, the
new director of Kinsey Institute, has said that he looked into
the files -- which means they exist -- and he said that he thought
all the children had been molested by a single person, an elderly
pedophile, and that conflicts with what Dr. Kinsey wrote in the
Kinsey report.  So it has opened up a whole new realm of questioning.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And in fact, I understand that recently a woman
came forward and said that she was one of the molestation victims.
<p>
Family Research Council is looking for victims.  What are you
finding on that?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Well, we're hoping some people will
come forward because, actually, we want the identity of this so-called
lone pedophile, because if we nail that down, people will begin
to realize what may have happened to them so many years ago at
the Kinsey Institute.
<p>
This woman's story has checked out.  It
has an Indiana University tie, and we are hoping she's the first
of many who will come forward.  And, incidentally, her story probably
was research that was included in Kinsey's female volume, which
followed the male volume.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We don't have a lot of
time left, Bob, but the story doesn't end here, and I am sure
<i>Straight Talk</i> is going to bring updates.
<p>
But we are looking at
congressional action related to <i>The Children of Table 34</i>.  In
fact, you may even be testifying, Bob.  Briefly, in about 20 seconds,
what can Congress do, and what is happening right now in terms
of looking into this data?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Okay.  Right now before
Congress is the Family Privacy Protection Act, which bars any
federal funding for research into using children for which parents
have not given written consent.  We're testifying to say this
is a good idea; you've got to have written consent.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Really quickly.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Okay, and we hope Congress will
absolutely open the doors of the Kinsey Institute, using subpoena
power, holding hearings, whatever it takes to shed light on this.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're going to look forward to that.  <i>Straight Talk</i>
continues after the break.  Stay tuned to hear how you can obtain
a copy of the video, <i>The Children of Table 34</i>, and information
about other important issues being investigated by the Family
Research Council and Robert Knight.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Thank you for watching <i>Straight Talk</i> and the Family 
Research Council exclusive video production, <i>The Children of Table 34</i>.
 If you want more information, the video or some information,
please call the Family Research Council at 1-800-225-4008.
<p>
Hope you can join us next week when we'll be talking to people who
are successfully paving the way for the country's welfare reform,
and we'll share with you how you, too, can get involved.
<p>
Thanks for watching.

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick. Our show this week will 
try to answer some hard questions. What happens to people if the 
government isn't the safety net we've come to expect?  What kind 
of help can the private sector really be?
<p>
The concept of real welfare reform can seem overwhelming. The 
government for many years has said that it can best care for people 
caught in tough circumstances.  But the problem with the welfare 
state is that it's people, not statistics, we're talking about. 
The state doesn't have time or manpower enough for one-on-one attention. 
When lives really change, something personal happens. It is 
individuals who actually reform the welfare state, one person at a 
time, one life at a time.
<p>
Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> portrays examples of individuals like 
you and me who are making that reform a reality.  But first, let's take 
a look at the story on the minds of most of political Washington, 
yesterday's government shutdown in the name of a balanced budget.
<p>
I had the chance to speak with Family Research Council's Bill Mattox, 
who has been working on budget and tax policy in Washington, D.C., 
for more than 10 years. You won't find Bill's insights as to how this 
situation will affect our country and families in most news stories. 
Join me in questioning Bill on what lies behind the headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We are here with Bill Mattox, Vice President for Policy 
of the Family Research Council, and, Bill, as you and I know, the train 
has wrecked. It doesn't seem like Washington, D.C., is stopped, and yet 
a lot of people, interestingly enough, are saying that the train
wreck isn't about Medicare; it's not about whether or not we have
one tax proposal or another.
<p>
<i>The Washington Post</i> and Republican leadership are agreeing that 
the real issue here seems to be balancing the budget long term, over a 
seven-year period.  What do you think the train wreck says to pro-family 
America?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  I think it is primarily about whether or not the President 
and Congress agree on getting a balanced budget in the next seven years. 
The Congress has repeatedly moved toward that target and has said,
&quot;We believe strongly in a balanced budget, and here's proof
in the pudding.  Here's our proposal, here's our plan; we want
to see this adopted.&quot;
<p>
The President, in recent months, has given some good lip service to this 
idea. He has not been a long-time supporter of a balanced budget, but 
here in recent months he has said some nice things.
<p>
Unfortunately, when putting-up time comes, you cannot get to a balanced 
budget unless you are willing to make some very hard decisions.  And what 
the President is suggesting is that some of the hard decisions that 
Congress has made in the Medicare realm, for example, where they are not 
allowing the kinds of increases that would otherwise occur, that are going 
to lead the Medicare program to bankruptcy, what the President is suggesting
is that those kinds of hard decisions he doesn't want to see made
and would rather not have a balanced budget if that is what is
required.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And isn't that ironic, because he campaigned
on a balanced budget, as the freshman class campaigned on, and
it seems now that whether or not we have a balanced budget is
the true sticking point.  Is that going to hold?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: I think it will be <b>the</b> central question.  The big issue 
will be, how quickly will this whole matter be resolved?  I mean, I do
think we are going to see some type of stopgap measure adopted
here before too long that will get those nonessential government
services running again.  It is always kind of curious that these
programs are nonessential, and it leads me to say, Well, if they're
nonessential, why do we even have them in the first place?  I
mean, I do think we are going to see some type of stopgap measure
that will keep the government running.
<p>
The question will be, will we adopt a new budget for the new fiscal year, 
or will we instead continue to operate this year on last year's spending 
levels? Because that is essentially what is being done right now, is
that they are simply saying, We'll keep the government running
at last year's levels until we can settle this issue.
<p>
There are some advisors to the President, including James Carville(?), 
who, of course, was renowned for his insistence that &quot;It's the
economy, Stupid,&quot; in the 1992 campaign.  Carville has suggested
to Clinton, &quot;Look, don't resolve this problem.  Take this
to the voters next November and let the election of 1996 center
around the question of do you want to balance the budget on the
backs of the senior citizens,&quot; or whatever sort of spin that
Carville and company would like to put to it.
<p>
Of course, the big concern that we have is that this is irresponsible. 
This is just irresponsible on the part of those who have been elected
to govern this country, and we do not want to see an interminable
playing of politics by those in the White House or, for that matter,
those in the Congress.
<p>
We do want to see those pro-family tax cuts that, here again, both the 
President campaigned on in 1992 and the Congress did in 1994 after no 
action had been taken during the President's first two years in office. 
And one of the things that is threatened in this package is those pro-family 
tax cuts. If some type of resolution isn't made here, we could see those
tax cuts disappear, and I think that would be a tragedy.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: But the Family Research Council has been working on tax 
relief since the early 1980s, and ironically, the per-child tax credit,
which is about $2,500, if it had kept pace with inflation, would
be about $9,500 today, and we are talking about $500, which is
incredibly ironic.  Do you think the $500-per-child tax credit
will survive?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  We hope so.  The House and Senate leaders
met yesterday to finalize their tax plan.  The details actually
have not been released quite yet, but the early indications are
that the $500 credit has survived, that it will be the central
part of this tax package; that in fact in the first year, in 1996,
come October of next year, right before the elections occur, interestingly,
taxpayers will each receive a $125 check per child, and that in
the year following, the calendar year beginning then in 1997,
the $500-per-child credit would kick in.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: From your experience -- you do a lot of original polling 
for the Family Research Council, and next week, in fact, we are going 
to hear about what you are looking at for a family issues survey of 1995
-- but from your experience on the tax issue, how do you think
average Americans, pro-family Americans, are going to respond
to this kind of cat-and-mouse game we are playing?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Well, there are a lot of legislators who like to pose 
these two things against each other and say, well, you can either 
balance the budget or you can cut taxes.  But, surely, if you are 
going to be cutting taxes, you could be taking that money that you 
would have raised and putting it toward deficit reduction and making
it easier to balance the budget. 
<p>
These are not, however, mutually exclusive goals, and we have said from 
the outset, &quot;Look, we believe just like the American people&quot; 
-- and you're right; the polling data is ample there to show that the 
American people strongly want a balanced budget; they do want the fiscal 
house of this government brought into order.
<p>
Look, give us less government. Give us smaller government.  Cut our 
taxes. You can cut taxes and balance the budget at the same time.  That, 
I think, is something that this town really needs to hear, because quite 
often, as you say, a lot of cat-and-mouse games are played to suggest 
that you really cannot cut the taxes and balance the budget.  It isn't
so.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Bill, thank you very much for being with us,
and we look forward to seeing the poll next week.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Very good.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  After this commercial, we will be joined
by Jennifer E. Marshall and Deanna Carlson, Family Research Council
analysts who devote their time to researching and developing alternatives
to America's current welfare system.  Stay tuned for this and
the chance to meet those who are making practical changes in that
system.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. Tonight we are discussing welfare reform and the practical 
ways that individuals can step into the gap when the government frees 
itself from the welfare business.
<p>
Here with me now are Jennifer E. Marshall and Deanna Carlson of the 
Family Research Council.  Both work diligently to investigate what 
changes need to be made within our government and our society to 
make welfare reform a reality.
<p>
Welcome, both of you.  I get to see a lot of you, and frankly, you 
guys have been involved in a big fight in the last year.
<p>
Jennifer, can government do anything right?  I mean, the secret to 
welfare reform seems to be getting the government out of welfare.
<p>
MS. MARSHALL:  Well, I do agree that we need to revert from a 
government-driven system to one that is driven more by the private 
sector, by individual citizens and local communities.
<p>
In answer to your question, yes, the government can distribute some 
material assistance.  It doesn't do so efficiently.  But frankly, our 
concern is not particularly about inefficiency or about excess costs. 
Our worry is that government cannot offer material assistance and 
self-respect and human dignity at the same time.
<p>
You do rob people of something very precious. We need to allow them to 
work out problems on their own, to fend for themselves.  And you do 
damage to the human spirit when you suggest that they are not able to 
live by the same rules that the rest of us live by.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, Deanna, you, interestingly enough, were a social 
worker.
<p>
MS. CARLSON: Yes.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What was government able to do?  What were you able to do?
<p>
MS. CARLSON:  Well, working for a government agency is limiting. 
There are some things I could do for my clients.  I could set
up resources for them to meet their physical needs as well as
counsel them for their emotional needs.  But there comes a time
when people are in crisis situations where I felt like I had my
hands tied, and I couldn't give things to meet their deepest needs.
 Specifically, I am talking about their spiritual needs.
<p>
I remember one client I had who was severely handicapped.  She was 
three years old, and she required suctioning every 15 minutes so she
could breathe.
<p>
I went in and met with her mother a number of times,
and at one point I just realized that there was something more
I needed to do.  And so, on my own time, the best thing I did
for that family was to sit down with them one evening and to meet
with the daughters and the mother and to pray.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Not the kind of thing that you're going to get too often 
from a government service.
<p>
In your work at the Family Research Council, 
Jennifer, what would you like to see the private sector do?  Is it 
offering prayer support?  Can it offer food support?  How do you think
welfare can really be reformed?
<p>
MS. MARSHALL:  I think the key is to match individuals one on one so 
that we can build a personal relationship.  I am very interested in 
encouraging church members, in particular, to work one on one with 
children at risk.
<p>I think that religious activists are precisely the 
kinds of people who have the initiative and the energy and the idealism 
that will be required to do this job, because it is a big job.  But 
building relationships is the key.
<p>
We already have a very good precedent with crisis pregnancy centers. There 
are many of our constituents who are already doing this kind of work.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It is probably hard for people to believe, watching, saying, 
yes, it would be great if government would be more personal.  It would be 
great if we could build key relationships.  But how do you accomplish
a shift from a government-based care system to a private-based
care system?
<p>
MS. MARSHALL:  Well, I think, first, we need to look
at reducing the size of the population in need, and one of the
ways we do that is by an illegitimacy-based approach to welfare
reform.  We know that children born out of wedlock are much more
likely to live in welfare dependency, to depend on the government
for assistance, so that instead of just putting mothers back to
work, we should be finding ways to reduce the number of children
who are born to single mothers and absent fathers.
<p>
It is true that the government will always have a dampening effect on 
the kinds of private-sector remedies that are available, and so it
will be necessary to start scaling back government benefits, because
they crowd out civil society; they crowd out the traditional arrangements,
like families and churches.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I think here in Washington,
D.C, I know I walk by -- I am a public transportation user --
walk by homeless people and see a lot of heartache every day.
 We know that there is mental illness, we know there is drug abuse
and chronic alcoholism.
<p>
Deanne, I am wondering, is there not a
certain number of people who really need help, who are not capable
of some of the self-help things that could be offered?
<p>
MS. CARLSON: Yes, there are people who are dependent through nothing 
that they have done, who are born in a state of dependency.
<p>
I think what we want to do is encourage individuals to decide what they
can help with.  Some people are professionals.  They are skilled
to deal with very severe situations.  But for those of us who
don't have that type of education, we each have something that
we can give to someone.
<p>
If we see a homeless person on the street
and we have not worked for a homeless shelter, we can still give
that person respect, and that starts with smiling and with saying
hi.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  But for the people who are going to need a little
more than that -- because I think you are right -- you know, I
interviewed some people at a shelter not too long ago, and they
said the worst thing about living on the street is that no one
looks at you, and that was very powerful, to see these people
saying, We wanted just to be noticed.
<p>
But how does a government-private
sector world work, do you think?  Family Research Council is getting
ready for a welfare symposium December 13, Jennifer, that you
have been putting together that is going to look at private sector
initiative.  What is the key to private sector initiatives?
<p>
MS. MARSHALL:  Well, Kristi, you love individuals one at a time; you
don't love collectivities.  And this is one of the reasons why
we are talking about person to person, one heart at a time.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Fantastic!  And of some of the solutions that you have
seen, what strikes you as being some of the best and most powerful?
<p>
MS. CARLSON:  There's a church in Mississippi that was challenged
by the governor to meet the needs in their neighborhood, and they
identified the resources that they had within their church.  They
also identified the needs of their community, and they matched
people in need with people who could provide assistance.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That kind of matching is going to be key, and we are 
looking at the building of civic virtues.
<p>
When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will meet a former welfare 
recipient and find out how she, through determination and the support 
of an individual willing to help, overcame her welfare plight.  Please 
stay with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
NARRATOR:  When thinking of welfare recipients, what image
comes to mind?  Many identify welfare with nameless, faceless
statistics -- those who are beyond help, those who do not want
help.
<p>
But our current system has failed to bring the help that
lifts people from their sometimes shattering situations.  One
major flaw:  the system seems to have failed to incorporate the
key to achieving success -- personal relationships, a one-on-one
accountability.  That is how Lisa Biondo changed her circumstances,
stepped out of those statistics.
<p>
A former welfare recipient, Lisa now supports herself and her 
16-month-old son, Dillon. Combined with her own determination was the 
friendship of Megan McMullen. With her help and inspiration, Lisa began 
to achieve the success that marks her life today.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Tonight we are discussing
welfare reform and introducing you to individuals who diligently
are making a change in the current system.  Two of those people,
whom you just met in our video piece, are Lisa Biondo and Megan
McMullen.  With Megan's support, Lisa, a former welfare recipient
and single mother, has successfully overcome a difficult situation.
 I don't want to tell too much of the story.
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  Thanks for having me here.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thanks so much for coming.
<p>
MS. McMULLEN: Thank you.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What was it like for you?
 Maybe you could tell a little bit.  You were pregnant.  What
did you feel?  What were you thinking at the time?  What was your
family situation like?
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  When I found out I was pregnant,
I was very scared, and I turned to my mother and my father, which
they were very unsupportive of me, so I sought help through friends.
<p>
When I was seven months pregnant, I came to the Northwest Center,
and I was receiving AFDC at the time.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: How did you hear about the center?
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  Actually, I was staying at another maternity home similar 
to the Northwest Center. It was designed for a younger group, and I 
wanted to get out, so I researched some places and I came up with 
the Northwest Center and went to interview with them, and then I was 
accepted, and I had another interview with the actual house mother.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It had to be a very traumatic time for you.  What did you 
think your future would be like?
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  I had no idea.  It was very scary
when you are responsible for another life, and I didn't have my
high school diploma at the time, so I had to get my GED, and I
received that after I had the baby, and I am very confident now
that I can make it in life without the support from welfare and
things like that.  I have an excellent job, and I have great friends
who have been there for me for everything.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That's what I hear.  You met Megan, and was that a turning 
point for you?  How would you describe meeting Megan that day?
<p>
MS. BIONDO: Well, when I met Megan, I was not very open to talking to 
people. I didn't share too much information on myself.  And then as I
stayed there at the maternity home, we were in conversation, and
I just mentioned that I didn't have a birth coach, and so Megan
basically said she would be my birth coach, and it was just a
great experience, you know, having -- she was like a sister to
me -- [inaudible] brothers and sisters -- so this is great having
her support.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You do that for a living, Megan? Are you a volunteer?
<p>
MS. McMULLEN:  Yes.  I am a director of a crisis pregnancy center, and at 
the time I was not the director, when Lisa came to the Northwest Center; I 
was the program director.
<p>
She started coming to the pregnancy center because she wanted
to learn more about the pregnancy and about what delivery was
going to be like, and I guess we entered into a number of conversations
about that, and at one point she mentioned that she didn't have
anyone to go with her to the hospital that night, and she was
very nervous about it.
<p>
I just said at the time, &quot;Oh.  Well, I'll go with you.  Sure, no 
problem.&quot;
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  She didn't know what she was getting into.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You hadn't done that before?
<p>
MS. McMULLEN:  No, I had never done it before.  I
was very interested, and so Lisa and I started going to all of
her prenatal care appointments together and then to birthing classes,
and then we -- Dillon was expected -- what day was he expected
on?
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  He was expected July 8, but he didn't arrive
until July 21.
<p>
MS. McMULLEN:  We were waiting for a while.  But
that night, I guess, to tell the story, we were at a party at
the Northwest Center, and Lisa kept going, &quot;You know, I'm
getting the funniest feeling.  Something is going on.&quot;  And
everyone is going, &quot;Yeah, Lisa, that's all right.&quot; 
And she said, &quot;No, really, like something strange.&quot;
 Then we started timing them.  They were about five minutes apart.
 It was amazing.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So, tell me, how has this changed
your life?  You have now left welfare.  Was this a decision that
you guys talked about?
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  Well, basically, I had it
set in my mind, even from when I began receiving AFDC, I just
knew it was a sick cycle.  You get trapped in it, and I didn't
want to get trapped.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Had you seen friends or family or people around you 
getting trapped?
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  Well, I know a few people that have - you know, it is just 
the way -- they give you a certain amount of money to live on, but yet if 
you get a job, you make more than what you would normally get on a
check, and you would be ineligible, and so they basically, they
say, &quot;Well, here's your medical assistance, here's your food
stamps, here's this money,&quot; and it is very comfortable for
them to stay on it without having to go out and work.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And you didn't want to get stuck?
<p>
MS. BIONDO: No, I didn't want to -- I come from a middle upper-class 
family, and I was very embarrassed and ashamed to be on welfare.  But 
it was something that -- I used it as a stepping stone.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And for you, Megan, do you see in your work a lot of people 
trying to struggle to get off?  I mean, you see a lot of people coming in, 
and the temptation must be to stay on welfare.
<p>
MS. McMULLEN: Certainly. I think that quite oftentimes women are concerned 
about medical benefits, even, talking about a lot of minimum-wage jobs, you
are not getting medical benefits in order for their children and
things like that, that they feel trapped.  I think oftentimes
we are talking about young women that have second- and third-generation
welfare families, where it is everything that they have ever known.
 No one has ever talked to them about actually finishing high
school, actually going to college, working, doing things like
that.
<p>
I am seeing young women who are having their first baby
at 15, and that is not uncommon nowadays, to have four children
by 19.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What do you tell them?  You know, you have
some experience now to talk from, and you obviously work with
that every day.  What do you tell them when they come in?  What
can you say to someone in that situation?
<p>
MS. BIONDO: Well, basically, I have been through this so I know how they 
feel, and I have reached out and I have tried to help in my own way that I 
can.  I don't have much to give, but I try to give what I can.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You in fact invited a young woman to come and live with you.
<p>
MS. BIONDO: I did.  She was calling to the center, and I spoke
with her on the phone, and she finally came into the center, and
she didn't have anywhere to go.  Something inside of me just said,
Well, she can come home with me.  I have a very small apartment,
you know, but I wanted to provide for her.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Sure.
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  I gave her clothes, and she has a beautiful daughter
now, and she has everything, but I felt the need to help someone,
because I needed someone to help me.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Sort of one on one.
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  And Megan was there for me, so it is like
a cycle, you know, keep it going.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  In terms of what you are seeing in your work, Megan, is 
that what is making the difference, one person helping one person 
helping one person?
<p>
MS. McMULLEN:  I think, absolutely, the idea that someone who
is there at 12 o'clock at night when you call on the phone and
you're upset about something.  That makes the difference.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Sure.
<p>
MS. McMULLEN:  I think to know that there is someone
out there who truly cares, who is starting to talk about the future,
to go, &quot;Well, what are your plans?  Where do you want to
be a year or two from now, and what are the plans and the steps
that you can take to be there?&quot;
<p>
I think specifically with Lisa, the big step was originally to get her 
GED and then to get some work experience and then to get a job of her own, 
which she has now, which is fantastic --
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  Excellent.  An excellent --
<p>
MS. McMULLEN:  -- affording her -- she has health benefits,
she has an apartment for herself, and she can afford to pay for
excellent day care for Dillon, which is, I think, two years ago,
when you were talking about it two years ago, you wouldn't have
thought that that was possible.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, the Northwest Center is very well known in Washington 
for doing some wonderful work.  Everyone I know raves about it.  How could 
people get involved? Is there anything that you would advise someone in 
terms of how to be a real helping hand?
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  Well, basically, if you know someone that has reached out 
to you and expressed that they do have a problem, I would say do what you 
think that you can do to help them.  You know, there's lots of ways.  You 
can volunteer at the center.
<p>
MS. McMULLEN:  Lots of practical ways.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We have very little time left.  I would love you to give the
phone number of the center before we go.
<p>
MS. McMULLEN: It is 202-483-7008.  We are located in Washington, and we 
are open to taking anyone who would like to come and help us with anything.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: I have heard wonderful things.
<p>
Please stay tuned for more <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. Following this commercial break, we will be back and joined 
by Hannah Hawkins, a woman who took it upon herself to make a difference in 
her community. Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Anacostia. Southeast Washington, D.C.  A neighborhood 
recently labeled, &quot;The shattered heart of the murder capital.&quot;
<p>
In this neighborhood of what seems to be made of broken dreams and hopelessness 
lives Hannah Hawkins.  She is making a difference.
<p>
VOLUNTEER: Did you get a cup?
<p>
MS. HAWKINS:  God put us here for a reason, and that
is to serve and not to be served, and in saying that, He never
wants us to look down on a man unless we're picking him up.
<p>
[Children playing games.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And those who volunteer with Hannah
are also making a difference.
<p>
VOLUNTEER:  That's the sounds he makes when he's mad.
<p>
MS. HAWKINS:  Hold up nine fingers.  Now take away four.  Now, how many 
have you got left?
<p>
CHILD: Five.
<p>
VOLUNTEER:  It comes with volunteering:  giving it back.
<p>
MS. HAWKINS: Number one, I feel that you need, everybody needs to volunteer
in some organization, and the cost of real love -- and that's
our motto -- is no charge.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Hannah is beginning reform at the beginning, with children.
<p>
MS. HAWKINS: Because you're going to either deal with them here to you're 
going to be dealing with them somewhere later.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It is easy to see why Hannah Hawkins has created a successful 
organization which helps the children of her neighborhood in Anacostia. 
Ms. Hawkins started the Children of Mine Center in her home more than nine 
years ago. Hannah and her center now serve 75 to 100 children a day in an
after-school program that provides an immeasurable amount of academic,
nutritional, emotional, and spiritual support.
<p>
Welcome so much. I am glad to have you and Deanna back again.
<p>
MS. HAWKINS: Glad to be here.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Why did you choose to focus on the children?
 There are a lot of needy people out there.
<p>
MS. HAWKINS:  Well, many years ago -- I am an activist; I am a native of 
this city, and there are very few of us that are left in the city -- I 
became a drug counselor.  I have three sons who are recovering addicts.
 I found that so much emphasis had been placed on the adult addicts,
and no one was paying attention to the siblings.
<p>
I would travel through the street, walking through the streets all hours of 
the night, coming from different meetings, and I would find children
who were out begging for various things.
<p>
Therefore, I felt as though that we had to do something.  We could no 
longer sit around the round table and discuss what was happening to the 
children and not do something for the children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That first day that you decided to have children come into 
your home, what was that day like?  Or was it a special child, when you said,
&quot;I'm going to open my home&quot;?  How did that happen?
<p>
MS. HAWKINS:  Well, it is so ironic.  It just happened.  You know,
me and my prayer partner had started a Bible study group.  She
had it in her home, and I encouraged her to take the children
from out of her home because, by word of mouth, she had outgrown
her home, and I found her a place across the street from where
I lived, and in finding her a place, I found that children were
coming to me for counseling, and it just happened.  It is just
like when you fall in love.  You don't know when or where; it
just happens.
<p>
And so I found that the traveling into my home,
which I live in a very small, two-bedroom townhouse in Anacostia,
that I was no longer able to accommodate the many children that
wanted to come in.
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, other government agencies, people have come to you and 
offered to take this over or help, and you have said no federal funding.  
Why is that?
<p>
MS. HAWKINS: Well, the government agencies have not virtually come to 
offer assistance and taking it over.  They have admired me from afar,
like many people.  But I tell people that your mouth can say many
things, but your behavior don't lie, and their behavior has lied.
 They have not come forth to virtually offer me anything, and
to be honest with you, maybe it's all for the best, because some
of the services, one of the major services that we provide at
the Children of Mine Center is Bible studies, and when you are
receiving federal funding, they don't want you to discuss religion
at all.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  As a social worker, Deanna, I know you saw
a lot of that.  What impresses you most about Ms. Hawkins' program?
<p>
MS. CARLSON:  There are so many things that impress me about your
program, but one of them is that it is in a neighborhood that
you live in and that you are meeting a need of those around you.
<p>
All of us find ourselves in different neighborhoods, with different
children around us, and I have just noticed in you a real genuineness
and wanting to reach out to whoever it is, whatever those needs
are that you have seen.
<p>
I am really impressed, too, in the fact
that you are working with children and in that investment.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  In terms of the lives changed, even in a nine-year period,
what has happened to some of the kids that you have had?
<p>
MS. HAWKINS: Well, I have had them more than nine years in actuality; I 
have had them for over 10.  It is so ironic that you asked me that
question, because I always use a slogan, &quot;From little acorns,
big oaks grow.&quot;  The children are able to equate to this,
because they can see a little acorn, and then they know about
the big oak.
<p>
The children that have stayed under the umbrella
of the Children of Mine Center have grown.  I have taken them
from profanity to prayer, from crime to a normal way of living.
 And the problem -- and this is what I tell so many of my constituency,
and I try to tell society -- you know, we are so busy -- so many
of the Congressmen are so busy posturing themselves until they
don't understand that these children are no different than any
of us.  It is lack of nurturing that has occurred.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What kind of homes do the children come from?  How would 
you describe their environment?
<p>
MS. HAWKINS:  Well, they come from all over the city, all over the 
metropolitan area -- Northwest -- all four quadrants -- Northeast, 
Southwest, and Southeast. Some come from two-family homes.  Some are in 
foster care.  Some have been adopted.  We have adopted some of these 
children.  Some come --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Is there a common thread, do you think,
as you look at them -- two-parent, one-parent, rich or poor? 
What holds them together in your home and in your heart?
<p>
MS. HAWKINS: In the Children of Mine or in their home?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: In the children that you see coming in.  What do you see a 
common thread today?
<p>
MS. HAWKINS:  Well, the main thing that I see, and the
most common denominator, is that consistency -- and this is what
society does not have anymore.  Look at today.  The government
is closed down.  You don't know what is going to happen tomorrow.
 Through the grace of God -- it is nothing that I am doing; it
is only through the grace of God that we are able to do this.
 It is consistency.
<p>
There are days when I am awfully tired, awfully
tired.  But I go in spite of my tiredness.  And the children see
a consistent pattern that we are there.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: The research has been very clear that consistency and a 
stable environment is one of the key elements that children need. 
Faith is something that government often doesn't provide.
<p>
Deanna, what do you see in the research in terms of the powerful impact 
that role models and role models of faith have on kids?
<p>
MS. CARLSON: The research has shown consistently that if you have a 
faith-based program, it is more effective than the government programs, and 
that is exactly what Ms. Hawkins is doing in her center.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: The children -- I know you've got to have many different things
that you give them:  food, shelter, academics.  Academics is another
long-term skill.  What do you do for the children in helping expand
their thinking?
<p>
MS. HAWKINS:  Well, first of all -- and you must
understand this, and I cannot emphasize this enough -- the cost
of real love is no charge.  The children, they are very sensitive,
and I think we as adults, we underestimate the intelligence of
children.  They are just like sponges.  They will absorb anything
that you give them.
<p>
I will say to you just like I say to them
every night, &quot;Poison in, poison out.  Love in, love out.&quot;
 And that's what we try to give them:  love, consistency, understanding,
and patience.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I understand that even though there
are sometimes gang problems, crime problems in the area, that
people have been very much leaving your program alone and giving
you the space to do what you are doing.  Why do you think that
is, when so many people are talking about those kinds of gang
and crime problems in the inner cities?
<p>
MS. HAWKINS: Well, it's only through the grace of God, and what you 
must understand -- I will say to you just like I say to a lot of the 
volunteers that might want to come, and they say to me, which I laugh 
about it now, but it used to be very insulting, &quot;Is it safe to come
there?&quot;
<p>
And I say to them -- and I am going to say this to
you -- &quot;When you're doing God's will, He will put a hedge
of protection around you at all times.&quot;  They are more safe
there than they are sitting in their own so-called secluded living
rooms.  The community knows that we are doing God's work, and
that's why.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We have about a minute left, and I would
love to give you the opportunity to say anything you would like
to the people who are watching about your program or the work
that you are doing.
<p>
MS. HAWKINS:  I would just like to say to
you, my brothers and sisters, today, we have so many children
that have a hole in their hearts.  Please close that hole with
love.  Take time out to reach down and pick one of these children
up.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you so much, Ms. Hawkins.  It has been
an honor.  When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shares with you highlights

<p>
COMMITTEE CHAIR: Mr. Knight, could we have your statement, please, sir?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: Sure. I am Robert H. Knight, Director of Cultural
Studies of the Family Research Council.  I am a former journalist,
having been a news editor at the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, a Media Fellow
at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, and a Senior
Fellow for Cultural Policy Studies at the Heritage Foundation.
<p>
We appreciate your including Family Research Council in this hearing,
and we feel we are speaking on behalf of many parents all over
the United States.
<p>
In 1986, the White House Working Group on the
Family's final report included these words:  &quot;Parental nurturing
and education of the young is our most important national investment.
 It is the fundamental task of humanity.&quot;
<p>
Those words were penned by my boss, Gary Bauer, and nothing that has 
happened since has changed the truth of what he said.  It could have been 
said at any time and any place.
<p>
We often hear from child's rights advocates
that it takes a whole village to raise a child.  But parents are
indispensable.  Not even a whole village can replicate them. 
As the people most responsible for and most equipped to discern
the needs of their children, parents must be accorded deference
in all matters of education.
<p>
Children in public and private schools
are taught by dedicated professionals, but only because the parents
consent to have these professionals participate in their education.
 No one but a parent can understand how parents feel about their
own children.  And I am talking about adoptive parents as well
as biological ones.
<p>
Mother Teresa described such devotion through
a firsthand observation at her clinic in Calcutta.  She said,
&quot;I'll never forget.  I gave a child to a Hindu family, and
after a few months, I heard the child became very, very sick,
and I sent for the family, and I told them, 'Give me back that
child.  I'll take care of the sick child, and I'll give you another
healthy child.'  The father looked at me and said, 'Mother, take
my life rather than take the child.'&quot;
<p>
Like this Indian father,
most parents would lay down their lives for their children, and
they are acutely aware of this responsibility.  So decisions about
what kind of information is conveyed to children or extracted
from them are the parents' natural prerogative.
<p>
Any research methods,
including surveys, that place a barrier between children and their
parents should be outlawed.  Increasingly, parents have found
themselves fighting for their most fundamental rights against
hostile educators and government officials who honestly believe
that they, not the parents, know what is best for the children.
<p>
Such officials work overtime to acquaint children with revisionist
history, graphic sexual materials, and relativistic notions of
morality, all in the name of research and education.
<p>
Often parents are unaware of what the children are receiving.  The 
concept of informed consent is faulty, because there are too many ways 
for it to fail, as Senator Grassley pointed out.  Parents are often
not given adequate information, and a teacher may send a child
home with an announcement about an upcoming survey, but unless
the parents signs a permission form, there is no way to determine
if the parent ever got the message.  As a parent myself, I can
tell you, those messages don't always get through.
<p>
And to those who argue that written requirements are cumbersome and 
expensive, a loss of parental freedom to determine a child's education is
a far higher cost, one that is unacceptable.
<p>
There are other ways
that information can be obtained on dangerous behaviors.  Documentation
of the numbers of cases of out-of-wedlock pregnancies, sexually
transmitted diseases, suicides, drug overdoses, and the like is
readily available.
<p>
The drive to target all teens and children
because of the actions of the unfortunate few is a manifestation
of the educational dogma that information, in and of itself, with
no moral reference, can make a difference.
<p>
But two decades of
research have shown that giving youngsters more value-free information
about sex, for instance, has not resulted in any behavioral change
at all except perhaps earlier experimentation leading to more
problems.
<p>
With the advent of Goals 2000 and its emphasis on national
standards and accountability, the role of testing is becoming
paramount.  Outcome-based education as implemented by Goals 2000
moves schools away from the strictly academic and toward the production
of certain attitudes.  Consequently, the line is becoming blurred
between what is educational and what is therapeutic.
<p>
Parents are worried about surveys for two reasons. Some questionnaires 
reveal information that is nobody's business but that of the families,
and some questionnaires convey information to the children that
the parents would rather their children were not exposed to. 
<p>
The issue has been driven primarily by sex, suicide, and drug surveys
among young teens, some of which have been politically motivated
and manipulated.  A few years ago, a national youth survey on
sexuality contained questions that were so graphic that many parents
felt they were pornographic.
<p>
Concern over research on hapless
children has been driven by revelations of abuses by federally
funded researchers going as far back as the famous studies of
Alfred Kinsey in the 1940s.  It was under grants from the National
Research Council that Dr. Kinsey collected material for his famous
Kinsey report.
<p>
In that report, 317 children were reported to have
been subjected to sexual molestation and their responses recorded
in a graph table.  Nowhere is there evidence that parental consent
was given.  In fact, no one, not even parents, could give consent
for such acts.  But that didn't stop the Kinsey scientists.
<p>
Further documentation of this shameful episode of scientific abuse can
be found in the Family Research Council's new documentary, <i>The
Children of Table 34</i>, which I am donating and submitting for the
record.  It can also be found in <i>Kinsey, Sex and Fraud:  The Indoctrination
of a People</i> by Dr. Judith Reisman, Edward Eichel, with Drs. J.
Gordon Muir and John Court as editors.
<p>
Now, I am not suggesting
that the mere taking of a survey is equivalent to the kind of
abuse that Kinsey recorded, just that there is a temptation to
gather information because it can be done without asking whether
it should be done.
<p>
Surveys that ask questions about suicide or
drug use can plant the idea of either activity as an option, when
a teen may never have entertained this option.  For sheer repetition
of reference, harmful activities can lose their power to inspire
natural resistance.  After all, if a teen hears about this stuff,
a teen could conclude, &quot;If we're talking about it so much,
everybody must be doing it.  What's wrong with me?&quot;
<p>
Sex surveys, in and of themselves, are objectionable when directed toward 
children, and they are notoriously unreliable.  They are slanted towards
the unconventional.  People who indulge in unconventional sexuality
or precocious sexuality are far more interested in talking about
it.
<p>
Here's the dilemma for little Susie.  She responds to a question
that asks if she's a virgin.  If she answers yes, then she is
supposed to skip through several detailed questions about sexual
activities, such as how many partners she had had.  After an exercise
like that, she may feel like a sexual underachiever for having
kept herself chaste.
<p>
Teens are very peer conscious and can feel
left out and stigmatized for having to exempt themselves from
a battery of questions.
<p>
Likewise, if the onus is on the parent
to opt a child out of intrusive experiences, the possibility for
stigma is greater than if all parents have to opt their children
in with written consent.  Those who administer surveys are more
interested in high compliance than parental input, so they tend
to be opposed to such safeguards.  But parental rights have to
come first.
<p>
Family Research Council supports efforts like H.R.
1271 to safeguard the rights of parents to direct their children's
education and welfare, and that includes how, where, and when
children are included in research.  Parents are assigned that
task by no less an authority than God Himself.  It would be the
epitome of hubris to tamper with that bond because some educational
experts feel they are smarter than everybody else. Thank you.
<p>
COMMITTEE CHAIR:  Thank you, Mr. Knight.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council.</i> I'm Kristi Hamrick, and we are here to present issues that 
affect your family, all American families, and the impact government
and social policies have on families today.
<p>
In fact, this week's show provides new scientific data on what Americans 
want for themselves, their families, and our country as a whole.  Tonight 
you will hear the exclusive results of the Family Research Council's 1995
Family Issues Survey, which delves into things like our current
welfare program, crime, divorce, and pop culture's influence on
you.
<p>
In fact, just yesterday, Family Research Council held a news
conference to release scientifically conducted poll data.  Although
major media from ABC, NBC, and PBS attended, these stories that
appeared couldn't cover all of what is the most pertinent about
this original work.  So, before we divulge into our findings,
let's take a look at what the newspapers and networks got to see
of our news conference as <i>Straight Talk</i> takes you Behind the 
Headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">

<p><center><h4>Excerpt from News Conference</h4></center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I'm Kristi Hamrick, the Director
of Communications for the Family Research Council.  This is the
fourth annual Family Issues Poll.  Family Research Council, which
has had an interest in examining research of all kinds, likes
to participate in it as well, and sometimes I think we all know
that a number can say almost anything that you want it to say.
<p>
So we like to do our own numbers, take a look for ourselves at
where the people are in terms of their attitudes and values and
how do they see some of the reforms, from welfare reform to some
of the choices on abortion to some of the things about our culture
that really concern us.
<p>
So we have been doing polling under the
leadership of Bill Mattox, who is the Vice President for Policy,
who has been here in Washington quite a while and at FRC, I think,
10 years, and has been directing these polls.  So I would like
to invite him up to let you know where the country is today on
some really key family issues.  Bill, if you would come on up.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Thank you, Kristi. Today I am pleased to join Bob
Maginnis of our staff in releasing the findings of the Family
Research Council's 1995 Family Issues Survey.
<p>
Like other FRC polls that have preceded it, this year's survey addresses 
a wide range of questions that have cultural, public policy, and electoral
implications.  Indeed, the clear message of our 1995 survey is
that the catch phrase for the 1996 election year is unlikely to
be, &quot;It's the economy, Stupid.&quot;
<p>
Instead, many Americans perceive that our nation's most daunting problems 
stem from the fact that our nation's ship has lost its moral compass. This
is, I think, quite evident in a number of the findings of the
Family Research Council.
<p>
Kristi mentioned there was a significant
section of our poll that dealt with questions surrounding the
current welfare reform debate and, indeed, questions that I think
will become increasingly important as we see the budget battle
continue and as we see Congress increasingly move toward relimiting
government.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  We gave the statement and asked
for a comment.  The statement is:  &quot;The values promoted in
today's movies, on television, and in music lyrics do not represent
my views.&quot;  Seventy-five percent of all Americans agree with
that statement.
<p>
Now, possibly they agree -- and this is when we
asked even further about what would you do -- we found that clear
majorities of Americans would block out offensive material --
violence and sexually explicit material -- on cable television
and on computer networks.  As well, when we talk about cyberspace,
we also found, interestingly, that young women and older women
agree:  they don't want this sort of trash on our computer networks.
<p>
You know, we ask Americans -- and they are divided about this,
interestingly -- whether or not they can protect their kids from
the offensive nature of what's going on in our pop culture and
are they doing a good job.  Now, what we found is that 49 percent
said, &quot;Yes, we can protect our kids from the ravages of the
pop culture.&quot;  Forty-nine percent said, &quot;No, we can't.&quot;
 Forty-nine percent -- maybe the same first 49 percent -- said,
&quot;We're doing a good job.  We're monitoring the shows, we're
monitoring the music lyrics, and we're protecting our kids.&quot;
 But 49 percent said, &quot;We aren't.&quot;
<p>
We found that one-third
of all single moms and one-third of all divorcees say that they
can do the job.  But 61 percent, almost two-thirds, said, &quot;We
need help.  We cannot do this by ourselves.  We need possibly
government, possibly community activities, possibly even the industry,
to jump in and do the right thing.&quot;
<p>
We found that more than nine out of ten parents oppose public libraries 
giving objectionable materials such as <i>Playboy</i> magazine to young children 
without parental consent.  Then we found about nine out of ten Americans wanted
parents to have a veto power over the materials that any child
-- their child -- would take out of library, specifically because
parents are concerned about the moral guidance of their children,
and also, quite frankly, they are liable for the materials that
their child might check out of the local library.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: With that, we'll throw it open for any questions anyone may 
have. Yes?
<p>
QUESTION:  Is there a reason why you didn't focus on education
and the role of school?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, actually, we have done
a lot of education research in the past.  Last year's survey --
and this did not get the kind of pickup that it should have --
last year's survey found that younger parents -- that is, parents
of preschoolers and of early elementary school-aged kids -- tend
to support school choice to a significantly larger degree than
do parents of older children.
<p>
I think there are all kinds of reasons
why this might be so.  They may be less subtle in neighborhoods
that are -- and may have yet to even buy a house -- and since
we know that housing is quite often closely tied to school districts,
that could be part of the reason.
<p>
I think in many ways younger parents may perceive that the school can more 
likely have a positive effect on a potentially troubled child than that the 
potentially troubled child might have a negative effect on the school culture;
whereas, with older children, the opposite may be true, that many
perceive that a troubled teenager is more likely to be a corrupting
influence in a school than to benefit from some type of school
environment, having a positive effect on it.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, we'll be joined by Bill Mattox 
and Lieutenant Colonel Bob Maginnis, the two FRC staff members who spearheaded
the development and analysis of this year's poll, to bring you
the results.  Stayed tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. Tonight we are presenting the 1995 Family Issues Survey results
and FRC's top 10 list of findings, as detailed by our guests,
Family Research Council Vice President for Policy Bill Mattox
and Policy Analyst Lieutenant Colonel Bob Maginnis.  Welcome,
gentlemen.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Thank you.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  This was a very impressive product.  How long did it take 
to put together?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, we started the process back in the summer,
identifying some different questions that we wanted to ask, including
some that we have asked before in previous years.  We then put
together the questionnaire during the course of September and
worked then with our pollster in kind of fine-tuning that.
<p>
He went to the field in October, and we then spent really much of
the month since then analyzing the results, writing up the report,
getting graphics coordinated with Valerie Stambaugh of our staff.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, a product like this -- we have heard of Gallup
polls, we have heard of Worthland(?) polls.  Any difference between
the poll that Family Research Council did and anything you might
see on the evening news?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: No.  We, much like they,
surveyed 1,000 Americans, randomly selected by telephone, and
asked them a series of questions that they then responded to.
 So it was very, very similar to the kind of thing that you would
see on an evening newscast.
<p>
In fact, some of the CNN polls or other polls that you might see that some 
of the networks do quite often only surveyed 500 Americans and so, therefore, 
don't actually have the same accuracy that ours would.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: One of the things I know people look at is, is this the kind of 
thing I can depend on?  We're going to talk to people later about getting
a copy of this.  But when they look at this, they could depend
on this as well as they can depend on any other numbers that they
might find?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  I would say so.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Yes, I would think so.  You know, we look at polls all 
the time in writing the papers that we write, and the numbers here really
corroborate what we have seen on virtually every other national
poll.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're going to talk about what we've seen.
 Let's begin to count down Family Research Council's top 10 findings
in the 1995 Family Issues Survey.  Number 10:
<p>
MALE SPEAKER: Family breakdown and moral decline are fueling perceptions 
America is on the &quot;wrong track.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Family breakdown. So, tell me, we're talking about being right 
track, wrong track. Why do people think that?  What kind of went into the 
development of that number?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, the first question in every
single poll we have ever done is, &quot;Do you think that America
is on the right track or on the wrong track?  Are we moving in
the right direction or not?&quot;  And what we found this year
is that a significant proportion of the American public -- roughly
two-thirds -- say things are headed in the wrong direction.
<p>
What was really interesting is we followed this question up with a
second question that says, &quot;Why?&quot;  Because, typically,
that right track/wrong track question, the answer to it has closely
tracked the economy, and if the economy was going in the right
direction, Americans said the country was going in the right direction.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Kind of a guaranteed connection, wasn't it?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Exactly.  This year what we found is that when we asked
people, &quot;Why are things off on the wrong track?&quot; it
is not, they think, because of economic problems -- 18 percent
said that that was the primary reason -- but the vast majority
said, instead, that the primary reason why they think things are
going in the wrong direction is because of the breakdown of the
family and the decline in values in our society.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Did you find that surprising, given the relative stability 
of the economy?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Yes, I think it really is interesting
that you have this divergence between these two questions that
had always in the past gone hand-in-glove.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: In terms of what you are seeing, Bob, your area takes a look 
at a lot of crime and cultural issues.  Do you think that that underscores
the need to continue to look at those kinds of areas?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Well, clearly, you know, the last Presidential election
was about &quot;the economy, Stupid,&quot; and now it is really
what is happening in the cities and in the suburbs of our country.
 And if we don't do something to turn around the violent crime
epidemic, especially amongst the youth, then we are going to find
that no telling where this country is going to go.
<p>
So we have to turn that around.  That is why I think parents or single 
people throughout this country understand that we are indeed on the wrong
track.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to keep looking at what track
we are on.  To continue our countdown, let's look at finding number
9:
<p>
MALE SPEAKER: Adoption is viewed as the best response.
<p>
FEMALE SPEAKER: And abortion is viewed as the worst response to an unwed
pregnancy.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Very surprising findings when it comes
to the issue of abortion.  We hear all the time that Americans
worldwide are clamoring for more abortion, people worldwide, but
our finding found that abortion was not the knee-jerk response
of people to an unexpected pregnancy.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Oh, no. In fact, our polling suggests that the majority of the 
American public are clearly anti-abortion.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What kinds of numbers did you get on that, though?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Well, we asked people, we said, &quot;Look, imagine a young girl 
who is unmarried, teenager. She's pregnant out of wedlock.  What do you think 
she should do? Should she abort the child, put it up for adoption, marry
the child's father, or should she bear the child and keep it herself?&quot;
<p>
What we found is that the American public generally said adoption
is the best option.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Interesting.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: And that, closely following that, marrying the child's father is 
the second-best option.  And interestingly there, there were a lot
of men, both married and single, who regarded marrying the child's
father as the best option.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Many people think that men think abortion is the best option.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Oh, yes. I mean, that, I think -- I would have expected most 
men to say marriage is the last thing we want considered here.  But instead,
we found just the opposite.
<p>
When we asked, &quot;What would be the best thing that she could do?&quot; 
abortion ranked at the bottom.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Interesting.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  When we turned the question around and said, &quot;What do you 
think would be the worst thing that she could do?&quot; a clear majority said
abortion is the worst thing that she could do in that kind of
situation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Did you see breakdowns in ages or by
race or anything like that, or was it primarily a break between
male and female?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, most of this kind of standard
rank order held true across virtually every demographic group
that you could find.  There were some notable differences on the
basis of gender, with men being more likely to support marriage,
women more likely to support adoption, and their second choice
-- at least the choice of single women -- their second choice
was for single motherhood.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Interesting.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: And then third was marrying the child's father.  But abortion,
on everybody's scorecard, ranked last.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So, ladies, there is hope for you.  Marriage was at the top of 
the men's list. Okay, let's see now finding number 8:
<p>
FEMALE SPEAKER: Most Americans, including rank-and-file pro-lifers, strongly 
oppose subsidizing illegitimate births.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Strongly oppose. That's interesting, because the budget debate 
now, you would think, listening to the President and some of the Democratic 
members of the House and Senate, that people are out there saying, &quot;I 
want welfare just as it is.&quot;  But you do not find it?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: No. In fact, I think it is a reflection of some of the 
resistance to single motherhood and the perception that many people have
that government programs help to encourage illegitimacy; that
they do not want to see increases in the size of one's welfare
check if they have additional children out of wedlock.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That's interesting.  Do you think that, in terms of 
compassion -- you saw people saying basically, &quot;I am concerned about
subsidizing the lifestyle,&quot; or, &quot;I think there are better
ways to be compassionate.&quot;  What did you see in the numbers?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: I think one of the things that we saw throughout
this was that there is a compassionate impulse on the part of
many Americans, but there is also, I think, a recognition that
government programs quite often undercut that compassionate impulse
and encourage the kind of behavior that actually causes people
to find it that much more difficult to lead healthy, productive
lives.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Does this surprise you?  Bob, you watch the
Hill, as well as all of us.  As we are watching the whole welfare
reform debate, were you surprised to see the direction that Americans
were tilting?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  No, not really.  I think most
Americans are disenchanted with the current welfare system.  But
I was surprised that the numbers are absolutely high in regard
to especially the most religious part of our culture.  They were
saying, you know, fathers need to take more responsibility.  We
don't need to subsidize more illegitimate children.  What we need,
obviously, is to reinforce the family and reinforce marriage in
this country.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right, which is sort of an interesting
Family Research Council theme.  It is nice to hear that we are
consistently right on that.
<p>
We have a lot of other findings to come, but one last thing.  Do you 
think that this will be helpful in FRC's work on the Hill?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: I do, especially on the
question about the family cap, because, as you know, there has
been a debate between pro-lifers.  A lot of our friends have said,
&quot;You know, we really ought not to limit these welfare checks,
because we might encourage abortion.&quot;
<p>
Others have said, &quot;No. We've got to tackle unwed pregnancy, because 
those are the girls that are quite often having the abortions.&quot; I 
think this polling data, especially since pro-lifers --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It kinds of pulls it together.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: -- were supportive, I think, may help us to break that impasse.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Great. When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we are going to hear 
more of this impressive kind of data.  We are going to continue with our 
top-10 countdown and bring you more details.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i>. We are in the middle of looking at Family Research Council's
scientific and original Family Issues Poll.  We are ready for
finding number 7.
<p>
FEMALE SPEAKER:  Most believe that preventative
strategies aimed at curbing out-of-wedlock pregnancies are better
than those strategies aimed at promoting workfare.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So work is supposed to be better, in the eyes of most 
Americans, according to the White House, according to a lot of congressional
things.  But what you have found out was that in fact that whole
saving-sex concept ranks higher.  I found that a little surprising.
 Were you all?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  I think this one really did surprise
me, because it is clear that Americans do believe that welfare
recipients, all things being equal, ought to work for their benefits.
 But when we asked them, &quot;Do you think that is the best strategy,
a remedial strategy after people are already on welfare, that
we ought to focus our attention on trying to get them off, or
should we be focusing perhaps more of our attention on trying
to prevent the need in the first place by discouraging out-of-wedlock
pregnancy and seeing if we can't keep people off welfare?&quot;
<p>
And, lo and behold, folks said, &quot;Yes, we really think this
is where our energy ought to go, in part because we think that
this problem may actually be easier to solve than the problem
of getting people off welfare once they are on.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Interesting.  It seems to be a conclusion they have come to 
without a lot of support from the media.  Certainly the workfare kinds
of ideas, from Tommy Thompson in Wisconsin to other states, get
a lot of attention, while marriage alternatives don't.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Yes, and I think it is important that people understand, we 
are not suggesting that we don't think workfare is a good idea.  We
obviously think that the welfare reform package on the Hill, which
includes a significant workfare package, makes sense.
<p>
All we are suggesting here is that maybe the question here is a little 
bit more complicated or a little bit bigger than many would like to
kind of limit the debate only to this safe territory over here,
talking about work, without getting into some of these thorny
issues about how do we discourage out-of-wedlock sex.  And yet
what our finding suggests is that the American people really want
a focus on encouraging abstinence and encouraging people to avoid
out-of-wedlock pregnancy.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You know, what is interesting
about this number is it almost has implications into the title
X, which is the government's abstinence, saving sex, proposals,
versus title -- well, actually it is title X, which is the bad
side of the coin, the condom distribution, compared to title XX,
which is saving sex.
<p>
We spend one dollar in ten on saving sex
and do a lot on condom distribution, and yet this is a whole study
saying we think we need to focus our whole welfare reform even
more on saving sex.
<p>
Do you think this is a message the Hill is ready to hear?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  I doubt they are ready to hear
yet, but we clearly need to be sending a very clear message that
children, whether they are 12 -- and in some cases we have children
12 years old having children in this country, unfortunately --
or they are 28, and if they are not married, they shouldn't be
engaging in activities that are going to lead, obviously, to more
children, because children raising children is not a good idea.
<p>
But whether it is title X or title XX, our government needs to,
in my opinion, back out of the business of promoting sex and get
into the business of promoting abstinence.  You know, there was
an interesting profile --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That kind of promotion is going to be key, I think, in 
what the Family Research Council does.  But let's move on with our poll 
just a second.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Sure.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  In terms of promoting sex, we are going to get back to that 
later, but right now, finding number 6:
<p>
MALE SPEAKER:  The religiously devout are more apt to give
and volunteer and say they would do more if government welfare
programs were dramatically cut or abolished.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: In some ways, the sex number and the religiously devout number 
tie together, do they not?  People saying attitudes and the kinds
of people that we raise our children to be are really significant,
and they see the religiously devout as being good citizens.  What
did you find to be interesting about that finding?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Well, I think the thing that is hopeful here is that if we do
see a cutback in welfare programs, or perhaps even the abolition
of the government welfare state, we have religiously devout Americans
saying, &quot;We are prepared to pick up the slack.&quot;
<p>
What is impressive, I think, about that sort of offer, if you will,
is the fact that if you look at what individuals who are attending
church weekly are already doing, they are already giving to charities
at a higher level and volunteering in various charitable endeavors
at a higher level.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is interesting, isn't it? By what amount are you finding 
the people of faith to be more involved in their community?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, what we found is that if you look, for example, at 
giving to charitable organizations, that nearly 100 percent of those 
who attend church weekly say that they made more than one gift at some point 
during the last 12 months.  For the general population, the number was in the
mid-80s.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Interesting.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  So the difference is not that substantial, though I suspect that 
if you were to ask the question in terms of dollar amounts or percentage of 
income or things of that nature, some of these differences would prove
to be even greater.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And it is interesting, too, isn't it, because there is a lot of 
media information out there that would indicate that people of faith aren't 
the best citizens. You certainly get that from movies like <i>Cape Fear</i> 
to whatever: when faith comes up, it's negative.
<p>
We are going to come back in a moment with finding number 5.  We are going 
to look forward to telling you that in just a second.  Please join us in 
looking at finding number 5:
<p>
MALE SPEAKER:  Even members of Generation X believe today's popular culture 
encourages teen sex, violence, and drug use.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Why did you find that to be -- well,
Bill, you are laughing.  You will have to tell us a little bit
about that.  But that was a very quirky number, wasn't it?  Where
did all that came into that come from?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Well, I will let him answer why first, because he was 
laughing more than I was.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  I am just tickled with some of our staff members who are helping 
to tell the story today.
<p>
But, no, here I think what is interesting is this:  When we asked
people, &quot;Do you think that the popular cultural influences
are positive or negative?  Do they encourage out-of-wedlock sex?
 Do they encourage drug use?  Do they encourage violence?&quot;
 I don't know that it is altogether that surprising that the general
public -- parents, especially -- say, &quot;Hey, this is harmful
stuff.&quot;
<p>
But I think it is rather interesting that those in
that 20-something generation -- 18- to 29-year-olds -- say, &quot;Hey,
we agree.&quot;  The levels of agreement are not quite as large,
but there is, nevertheless, a strong majority that are prepared
to say that we believe that these kinds of influences are negative;
that they do encourage these types of behavior; and that the values
in pop culture really don't reflect our own.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: But for kids to say that, though, that seems even more 
startling, I mean that they would acknowledge, &quot;You're right. I 
watch this stuff.  I am more likely to have sex, do drugs, you know,
check out whatever the song is talking about.&quot;
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: But even when we asked the 18- to 30-year-olds, they 
came back and they told us in large  majorities that what they are seeing
on the pop culture is not reflective of who they are, of what
their family is all about.  And they are upset about that.  And
I think that that sends a clear message to our Congress that maybe
we need to consider the types of violence, the type of drug promotion,
the type of teen sexuality that is being pushed into the living
rooms of every American home today and start to rein some of that
in.
<p>
You know, what happened with Time Warner this past summer
with regard to rap music -- you know, we start to recognize that
those messages are not promoting the sorts of things that we want
healthy Americans to be all about.
<p>
So we need to be involved, not only as a government but as a people, showing 
that our pocketbook can influence large corporations that are promoting this 
stuff.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Helping people make good decisions.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Hopefully.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now it is time for us to see finding number 4. Please watch.
<p>
FEMALE SPEAKER: Single parents say families need help shielding their kids 
from harmful cultural influences.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is an very interesting number, and it kind
of ties into some earlier poll data from the Family Research Council
in terms of single parents seem to be the most pro-family in some
ways.  What are you finding as we are tracking single parents
over the years?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, if you look at this question,
it begins to make sense when you consider that a lot of single
parents are trying to do the work of two and cannot be there to
monitor their children's behavior at every moment.  And so when
the kids come home in the afternoons to an empty house, yes, the
chances of their getting involved in some type of incident in
the neighborhood or something are probably greater.  The chances
of possibly getting hold of some pornographic video to pop in
the VCR or something like that are greater.
<p>
So I think in many ways the lack of adult supervision is something that 
many single parents feel very acutely, and they say, &quot;Hey, look. 
We don't think that the job that we are being asked to do is one
that we can do alone.  We do need societal community support.
 We need, for example, public libraries to respect&quot; --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Be a little more discreet.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: -- &quot;yes, and respect our wishes; that we don't want 
pro-homosexual or <i>Playboy</i> or other types of materials available 
to our kids without some type of shield.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What is interesting about that is the knee-jerk ACLU 
reaction to parents saying, &quot;I'm concerned,&quot; is, &quot;Look, 
it's your problem. Deal with it. You need to be the monitor.&quot;  
But with single parents, they've got all that they can do to handle.
<p>
Bob, you have been working with a lot of single-parent issues.  What do 
you see on that?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Well, clearly, the single-parent issue
is dynamite, given the illegitimacy rate, given the whole welfare
 debate that we have today, and the out-of-wedlock birth issue.
<p>
But when we looked at the entire population, America is split
in half on can we deal with this; and parents are saying, well
-- half of them say yes and half of them say no.  And then when
we ask the question, &quot;Are you monitoring your children?&quot;
half say, &quot;Yes, well, we are watching the same television,
we are watching the music videos, and so forth.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: They are trying.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  But the other half say no, they aren't doing a very 
good job. And so we have a country that apparently is just divided down the 
middle in regard to this whole issue, and we need to pay close attention to 
it.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And it is incredibly stressful for the people in that 
situation. That is the saddest thing. Please stay tuned for more <i>Straight
Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. Following this commercial
break, we will be back and counting down to the number one Family
Issues Survey finding.  Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We are back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>, and we are rolling down to FRC's number one
finding in our top-10 list resulting from analysis of the 1994
or 1995 Family Issues Survey.  The survey experts, Bill Mattox
and Bob Maginnis, are here helping me count down.  So let's see
what our next result is as we count down to number 3:
<p>
MALE SPEAKER: Most Americans strongly support increasing tax benefits 
for families raising children and want this relief to remain permanent.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I am not so surprised that people want tax benefits.
 I am a little surprised maybe by the budget debate where that
seems to be the one thing everyone is suggesting we get rid of.
 How do you think these two things come together in the budget
debate?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, the encouraging news here is that people
don't just want tax relief, but they see the need for tax relief
for families with children, and of course, we have been talking,
really, till we're blue in the face, saying, &quot;Hey, look at
the way in which the tax code, over the last 40 or 50 years, has
dramatically increased the tax burden on parents.  Shouldn't we
do something with that?&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What kind of numbers did you get?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, what we found is that when you put
this to the American people, roughly 8 in 10 say yes, you know,
this really ought to be done.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Wow!
<p>
MR. MATTOX: What is impressive about that is that support for pro-family 
tax relief is even higher than that for the flat tax, which is something
else that we polled here.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What did you find on the flat tax?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  The flat tax generally had numbers in the
mid-50s range for the entire population.  Now, among, say, Republicans,
it was in the 70 percent range.  But this number here on pro-family
tax relief was consistent in the high 70s across the board, and
again, the point there that we want to have this tax relief made
permanent, not simply some sort of gimmick that you get this year
but you don't get the following year, but instead, something that
is in the tax code permanently that solves this problem once and
for all.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: I think what is interesting about that
is the <i>Washington Post</i> on Sunday and other esteemed members of
the media have been indicating that we should get rid of this
tax relief; if just -- if it wasn't for that tax relief, everything
would be great with the budget.  But 80 percent of Americans say
that they want that, and they want it permanently.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: That's right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  How do you think that some of the
people who are discussing this could better connect with the public
on that?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Listen to the polls.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
But, clearly, you know, as Bill points out, they favor permanent
tax relief.  They don't want a temporary tax cut right now if
they are going to get something permanent long range, because
we recognize we have a deficit in this country that has to be
serviced, and if we don't take care of that now, we are going
to be in trouble a few years from now.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Well, and I think the key message here for those who are 
trying to cut the size of government is to link those cuts in government 
spending to tax cuts and to say, Look, instead of going out and spending
money for all these programs that really aren't doing a good job,
we are going to instead give the money back to the people who
earned it and let them use it to buy their kids braces or to fund
a family vacation or to put food on the table.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is what is kind of interesting about this, isn't it? 
Families in America are really taxed.  You are taxed a higher rate when
you have small children than if you had no children, and then
later you are taxed for a marriage penalty if you are married.
 And then, frankly, your children are going to pay for the things
that somebody else chose to spend.
<p>
I mean, do you think that these kinds of numbers could indicate a stronger 
stand is possible here in Washington on this issue?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Well, you are right in saying that these are extremely important 
issues, because even though they don't perhaps directly influence behavior, 
they certainly do indirectly.
<p>
I don't know too many people who sit down and say,
well, &quot;Let's have us another kid, because that will give
us a tax break of X amount or whatever.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That's right.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  But when people see that, gosh, you know,
it really is difficult to make ends meet, it quite often does
cause them to say, &quot;I'm not sure that we can afford to send
our kid to private school.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It's a concern.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Yes.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're almost there, but let's hear first finding number 2:
<p>
FEMALE SPEAKER:  Most believe that divorce laws should protect the spouse 
that wants to save the marriage.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Divorce reform is getting a lot of interest
at the state level.  Family Research Council does not favor a
federal policy; we would like to keep the government out of that.
 But there is a lot of empathy out there for people trying to
keep a marriage together, despite all the different movie evidence
to the contrary.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Yes, well, we are approaching a 50 percent divorce 
rate in this country with every new marriage, and it is devastating what 
is going on.  As you indicate, every state in this country, or most states, 
have laws that protect the spouse that is seeking the divorce and not the 
spouse that wants to salvage the marriage.  We asked and found out that more
than half of Americans want to change that, want to turn that
around.
<p>
We also found, interestingly, that in cases where adultery
is involved, or abuse, that more than three out of four Americans
say that the spouse that is not guilty of that offense should
get the custody of the children; and, also, more than half of
Americans say that for the non-philandering spouse, that person
should get more than half of whatever is left of the couple's
property.
<p>
So they are sending a very clear message that we want
to protect people that want to keep together and keep their marriage
going, because they understand how devastating this can be to
children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  In America, it would seem that the marriage
contract is the only thing that can be unilaterally exited from.
 Everything else, we have to at least sit down and have a discussion.
<p>
Very quickly, Bill, what are one or two divorce reforms that Family
Research Council favors?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, the State of Michigan is doing the very kind of thing 
that we were polling about here, which is to say that they have a piece 
of legislation before the state legislature there that says, in cases 
where a spouse wants to work things out, instead of the law tilting in 
favor of the one who wants to leave, the law will instead tilt in the 
other's favor and will require fault to be shown on their part in order
for the one who wants to leave to leave.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We could see some changes in the law.
<p>
And now, our number one Family Issues Survey finding:
<p>
MALE SPEAKER:  Like other Americans, blacks support get-tough 
measures to combat crime.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Every poll -- Family Research Council's included -- 
would indicate that crime is at the top of the things that people are 
concerned about. And yet you all found this number interesting because of 
some of the rhetoric that came out of the O.J. Simpson trial.  What
did you find interesting about this number?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Well, in the aftermath of the O.J., the message was 
that black citizens are not concerned about crime in this country, and that
is completely wrong.  We found in great numbers that black Americans
are very, very concerned about crime.
<p>
Specifically, they want restitution paid to the victims of these heinous 
crimes. We also found that they want criminals who are incarcerated to work.
They aren't out there to enjoy being in a health spa or watch
TV; they are there to work.
<p>
Now, part of the problem has been -- and we need maybe some legislation 
here -- is that only 9 percent of the incarcerated people in this country now 
have gainful employment where they could possibly earn money so they could 
pay restitution to the victims.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Nine percent, you say?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Nine percent.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  A very low number.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Well, there are some reasons.  You know, after
all, most Americans who are law-abiding don't want to give up
good jobs, their good jobs, so that somebody that is a felon in
jail, so that they can earn money to pay their victims.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: But at the same time, there
should be some way in which we can find alternatives.  And there
are some that are out there today.
<p>
We also found that black Americans want drug testing of criminals before 
they are released.  Why? Because a third of all people going into prison 
committed their crimes while they were either intoxicated with alcohol or 
they were using a now-illicit drug.
<p>
So we don't want people that are inebriated or potentially drunks, and so 
forth, to get back on the streets and to just ravage our communities. 
And black Americans, after all, are the most victimized people in this 
country. Their sons and daughters are the ones that are going to jail the 
most. But yet they understand.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It is interesting; I mean, the numbers would indicate that 
they have a very clear understanding of the cost of crime in their communities. 
<p>
We have about 15 seconds left, Bill. When you take a look at Family Research 
Council's crime proposals, what do you see from this poll that can help
people have a more crime-free America?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, one of the other items that we included on the poll 
questionnaire was, &quot;What do you think of the legalization of drugs?&quot;
and found that the overwhelming majority of Americans, including
once again black Americans, say we don't want drugs legalized; we want,
instead, for illicit drugs to remain off limits to young people.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Very timely, especially given our past surgeon general's
exit.  And I am afraid we are going to have to exit shortly, too.
<p>
When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> presents Gary Bauer, president of
the Family Research Council, as he shares his views today with
the American press corps.  Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i>. FRC staff every week is involved in events to promote
strong families and inform people about the status of real Americans.
<p>
Gary Bauer, president of the Family Research Council, recently
held a foreign press briefing to share his views with an international
audience. <i>Straight Talk</i> now brings you Gary Bauer in the Family
Research Council's Home Front News.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>
<p>
MR. BAUER:  First of all, I would like to thank everybody
for coming here today.  There's a lot of news breaking in Washington,
D.C., so I fully expected to come over here and perhaps chat with
one of you.  So I am pleased that some of you could fit this into
your schedules.
<p>
I would like to just make a couple of brief comments
about American politics and about America at the end of this century
and then find out what is on your mind about things going on in
Washington.
<p>
This is sort of an ironic time for the United States.
 My oldest daughter just went off to college a few months ago,
and she spent the summer reading and re-reading some of the old
classics that she thought that she would have to be familiar with
in an American university.
<p>
One of the books she re-read was <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> by Charles 
Dickens. You may remember that at the beginning of the book, there is 
this wonderful line: &quot;It was the best of times and it was the worst 
of times.&quot;
<p>
I found myself thinking as I saw the book that that is a great 
description of the United States in 1995, even though it was written 
about Great Britain and France many years ago.
<p>
There are a lot of reasons that Americans can be very happy in 1995. It 
has been a very successful century for the United States.  We have 
prevailed in several major world conflicts.  I think it is not an 
exaggeration to say that we have won the Cold War, at great sacrifice to 
the American people, both financially and also with the blood of their
sons in places over the years.
<p>
The American economy goes through all the cycles economies always go 
through. There are ups and downs, and so forth.  But if I would have 
brought my Ross Perot charts with me today, I could show you an economy 
that, since 1900, has produced more jobs for more people and more opportunity
than any system in the world.
<p>
There are great medical breakthroughs, technological breakthroughs. There 
are a lot of reasons for Americans to feel good about themselves and about 
their country.
<p>
But, ironically, for about 10 years now, when the pollsters ask 
the American people how they feel, two-thirds of them say that America 
is headed in the wrong direction.  They said that when George Bush was in the
White House, and they are saying it when Bill Clinton is in the
White House.  They said it when the Democrats controlled the Congress,
and they are saying it now that my friends, the Republicans, are
controlling the Congress.
<p>
I don't believe, when they say that we are headed in the wrong direction, 
that they are thinking about the economy or about the military or about other 
issues that tend to grab the headlines.  I think Americans are making a 
comment about the heart and soul of their country, about its culture.
<p>
I think that most experts, when they try to measure a great nation,
look at the obvious things:  the size of its economy, the strength
of its military, the gleam of its cities.  That is one way to
measure a great country, and certainly by those measurements I
think the United States would have to be judged a great world
power.
<p>
But you can also measure a country by the strength of its
families, by what its culture -- the values its culture passes
on.  You can measure a nation by how many of its children cry
themselves to sleep at night.  And I think that in the United
States in 1995, today, too many children will cry themselves to
sleep because they have been abandoned by fathers who aren't there,
because they have been exploited in a number of ways.  And I think
by those measurements my country is in danger of being something
less than a great nation.
<p>
Now, politicians are notoriously uncomfortable talking about 
these kinds of issues.  They would much rather talk
about marginal tax rates and whether the food stamp program ought
to have $1 billion or $1.2 billion.
<p>
But my feeling is that these are much grander issues and much more 
important issues than the others I just mentioned, and that even though 
politicians don't talk about these issues a great deal, I believe the 
American voter is deeply worried about these things and has in recent years 
been indirectly voting on these issues.
<p>
Now, I think that fact has benefitted my party. I obviously am a Republican. 
I served with Ronald Reagan for eight years and have been active in the 
Republican Party for a long time, and I think that, generally speaking, many
voters, particularly evangelicals in the southern United States
and Catholics in the Midwest, have tended to identify these issues
of values and culture with the Republican Party and have tended,
rightly or wrongly, to identify hostility to traditional values
with the Democratic Party.  And I think, as a result of that,
the Democrats have had a very difficult time keeping otherwise
historically loyal voting blocs in their camp.
<p>
I believe that, on through 1996 and into the next century, this is going 
to be the great debate in America.  It is going to be a debate about
liberty and how you use it, the relationship of liberty to virtue,
and it is going to be a debate about the simple question of how
it is that free men and women live their lives; and that this
is perhaps one of the most important debates that any country
and any nation can possibly have.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm Kristi Hamrick, your host.  And you might say we're going 
to have a board report today on whether the business of government, which
runs on your money, has been working for the American family.
<p>
The Family Research Council works closely with Members of Congress
working to influence key decisions that affect the family, which
is that foundational unit bound by marriage, blood, and adoption.
<p>
Today we will discuss vital issues brought before the House and
Senate, such as pro-family tax relief and the Partial-Birth Abortion
Ban Act.  We will also be looking ahead toward issues in 1996
that could adversely or positively affect the American family's
future.
<p>
First, though, let's see what Gary Bauer, president of
the Family Research Council, has to say about the monumental issues
facing us this week, both nationally and internationally.  This
is his perspective, brought to you without a journalist's bias
as a filter.  Gary Bauer instead takes you straight Behind the
Headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Gary, we just saw the great &quot;train wreck&quot; here 
in Washington, D.C., over the budget, and frankly, it doesn't seem like it 
was that bad.  What is your perspective on what just happened in the
budget debate?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Kristi, this is really the great untold
story.  We had all the build-up to this incredible emergency the
country was supposed to face if Washington closed down.  Washington
did close down, and I think most Americans went about their lives
pretty much uninterrupted.
<p>
Now, there was some inconvenience. If you were a tourist here, the major 
tourist attractions were closed. I saw in the paper that the Grand Canyon 
was closed. That raised some questions in my mind:  How do you close the
Grand Canyon?
<p>
But at any rate, I think most Americans still got
their social security checks, their Veterans Affairs checks, and
so forth, and I think it actually was a lesson that there is a
lot of waste in Washington that we can do without, and most of
the world and most of America really won't notice if we make those
cuts.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It has been very interesting in the budget
debate how so many people, liberal Democrats and the <i>Washington
Post</i>, are saying, really, the Republicans and the Democrats are
so close.  If we could just be reasonable over some things like
pro-family tax relief, let's just get that off the table.  What
is your perspective on whether it is reasonable to get rid of
pro-family tax relief?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  No, that is outrageous.  I mean, when you look at the last 30 
or 35 years, the average American family has had stagnant income.  Literally, 
income growth has barely kept up with inflation.  So the average family today 
is at the same place that family was 25 years ago.
<p>
But if you look at government and their growth in resources, their growth 
has been through the roof.  They've gotten more and more money from
more and more American citizens in the form of taxes each year
than they have had the year before.
<p>
The whole country is tightening their belt; Washington is on a consumption 
spree. That is exactly backwards.  The tax cut is the one thing that ought 
to stay, and the budget cuts have to be implemented.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: This Friday, Gary, you are scheduled to be on <i>Larry King Live</i>, 
talking about a political roundup, and James Carville(?), the President's 
advisor, is going to be one of the guests.  In the <i>Washington Post</i> 
this week, he was saying that this budget debate is good for Democrats.
 Do you agree with Mr. Carville?
<p>
MR. BAUER: I don't agree with Carville on much, but I understand why he is 
taking that position. Unfortunately, the polling data is showing that the 
majority of Americans, probably because of what they have been told in
the media, have sided with President Clinton's handling of this
budget crisis.
<p>
Now, Kristi, keep in mind, these are the same Americans
that, one year ago, voted overwhelmingly for fiscal responsibility,
cutting down the size of Washington, for less government, less
bureaucracy, less regulations.  And now, one year later, they
seem to be saying the exact opposite in these polls.
<p>
I don't know how all that is going to play out, but I think Carville, 
unfortunately, has some reasons to crow right now that he and the other 
handlers of President Clinton have managed to position the President to
look good in all of this; but in fact all Clinton is doing is
supporting more spending, higher taxes, and all the things that
I think most Americans are against.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Obviously, Gary, the top news story this week is Bosnia.  A 
lot of the news commentators over the weekend said that Clinton can't go to 
the Congress with budget demands and Bosnia demands and expect both to be 
met. Do you think that the budget battle puts Clinton over the barrel?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  I see the argument, but I don't agree with it.  The
President has made it clear he is going to send the troops to
Bosnia regardless of what the Congress does.  So it really doesn't
make any difference what Bob Dole or Newt Gingrich say about this.
<p>
Now, it is true that the Congress could cut off funds for the
troops in Bosnia.  I quite frankly think that would be a mistake
politically as well as a mistake for those men whose lives are
on the line.  Anything you do to try to get at Clinton on this
issue will be interpreted by the President and the press as cutting
out the ground from underneath the young men and women that are
going to be put in harm's way.
<p>
So I think we need to keep being critical of the President's program on 
Bosnia. I think we need to ask hard questions.  But I also think we have to 
make it absolutely clear that once American soldiers are committed that we 
will stand behind them.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What pitfalls do you see for the President
and the nation in the Bosnia conflict?
<p>
MR. BAUER: Well, you know, Harry Truman said a long time ago, 
&quot;The buck stops here,&quot; meaning the Presidency.  Bill Clinton 
ought to be aware of the fact that it is very easy, as Commander-in-Chief, 
to commit American soldiers in all sorts of places.  It is very hard to 
extricate them with honor once you've gotten them in a fix.
<p>
If you put 20,000 or 30,000 men on the ground in Bosnia, and a year from 
now there isn't peace, then getting out of Bosnia while maintaining the
credibility of the United States is going to be very tough, and
at that point the American people, I believe, and public opinion
generally will turn on the President.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: At the end of the Bosnia debate, do you think that Americans 
will be more in favor or less in favor of women in combat?
<p>
MR. BAUER: I think, long term, Americans are going to be in favor of the 
ability of women to join the military and serve in support positions. But
I think once Americans see young women, their daughters, coming
home in body bags, I believe at that point public opinion will
turn against this idea of complete equality in combat of women
and men.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you very much for being with us,
Gary.  We look forward to seeing you next week.
<p>
MR. BAUER: Thank you, Kristi.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, we will be joined 
by Marty Dannenfelser, who knows just about all there is to know 
about congressional happenings in Washington, and he will share that 
insight with us.  Please stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  As the year comes to a close, we are that
much closer to April 15, taxes, a word that can send chills down
the spine especially for lower and middle-class families, who
often bear the brunt of our country's current tax system.
<p>
Forty years ago, the average family paid one dollar in 50 in taxes;
today, it is an average of one dollar in four, and rising.  For
that reason, advancing pro-family tax relief has been an FRC goal
since its creation in 1981.
<p>
In early 1995, the House finally passed a tax relief package containing 
key elements which benefit American families.
<p>
[Scene from the floor of the House of Representatives]
<p>
CONGRESSMAN:  When we wrote the Contract with America, we said
we agree with the American people that the Federal Government
is too big and takes too much of their hard-earned money.
<p>
The average family today pays more in taxes than it does in food,
shelter, and clothing combined.  Most households have a second
wage earner, not to support the family but to support the government.
 And, Mr. Chairman, starting today, relief is on the way.
<p>
[Applause.]
<p>
[Conclusion of House floor scene.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: The package included:
<p><ul>
<li>The $500-per-child tax credit
<li>An adoption tax credit
<li>Marriage penalty relief
<li>A credit for the care of an elderly parent
<li>Expanded individual retirement accounts
</ul><p>
With the package, the seven-year budget resolution also passed, providing 
$353 billion in overall tax relief.  It seemed that families were on the 
road to victory.
<p>
Yet the Senate soon thwarted the House attempts and
refused to pass a tax relief package until it had been amended.
<p>
One positive element remained:  The Senate did hold onto the $500-per-child
tax credit, along with several other pro-family provisions.
<p>
It was just a few weeks ago that both houses passed the long-awaited
Balanced Budget Act of 1995.  But President Clinton chose to veto
the act, which contained much-needed family tax relief.
<p>
The train wreck happened.
<p>
The country waited to see what this conflict would
produce, and on November 19, both sides eventually committed to
enacting a seven-year balanced budget plan by the end of this
year.  But the details have yet to be announced.
<p>
Congressional Republicans consider the $500-per-child tax credit a vital 
element for providing family tax relief.  Therefore, the upcoming 
negotiations, as we count down to 1996, are crucial to the future tax relief
of American families.
<p>
With us tonight is Marty Dannenfelser, the Family Research Council's 
Assistant to the President for Government
Relations, and Marie Wheat, Legislative Director for Congressman
Steve Largent; and Rick Dearborn, Senate Liaison for the Heritage
Foundation.  They are here to discuss why we need change to our
current tax system, pro-family tax relief.
<p>
Marty has been following this closely. Frankly, why is tax relief so 
controversial?  You all have been working on it.  I know, Marie, you were 
on the Budget Committee.  What is so controversial about a little tax relief?
<p>
MS. WHEAT:  I think it is about the size and scope of government.
 We want families to keep more of their money, and that is what
it is all about.  We want the government to spend less and families
to be able to keep their own money and spend it the way they like.
 Parents are better than bureaucrats at raising their own children.
<p>
MR. DEARBORN:  I agree.  I think it just comes down to a classic
difference between conservatives and liberals, and liberals believing
in big government and the ability to spend your money, and conservatives
and families believing in the fact that, look, it's our money
to begin with, and we would like a little bit of it back.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I have been in Washington for a long time; I know you
all have been, too.  I remember when a $500-per-child tax credit
was a pipe dream. Recently the <i>Washington Post</i> said, you know,
we could really get along if we could just get rid of that $500-per-child
tax credit.
<p>
Is it in trouble?  What kind of fight is going on on behalf of tax credits?
<p>
MR. DEARBORN:  I would just offer up that I think that there is a chance that 
it could be in trouble. There is always the potential that it could be in 
trouble. I am glad to see that Dole recently came out saying that he is going
to fight for $245 billion.  Armey was asked recently, well, shouldn't
we lower the family tax relief?
<p>
His answer, I thought, was kind of classic, which is, &quot;Look, I already 
gave at the Senate.&quot; I mean, these are folks that had a $345 billion 
tax package with the Contract With America and already came down $100 billion.
 So there are problems with making sure to shore up everyone else
to keep family tax relief.
<p>
But I think with folks like Phil Gramm, in a way, because of the Presidential 
context, pushing Dole more to the right, to be conservative and hold his 
ground on this, I think that should help at least guarantee some form of 
family tax relief.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, Marty, you were on the Hill so
recently before joining Family Research Council.  Do you think
from your long experience that Presidential politics are making
tax relief possible?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, I think it helped. Certainly there is a certain 
competition for the pro-family vote, which we feel is very healthy, and in Iowa, 
for instance, the first state, the pro-family forces are very strong, and I 
think that does give incentive to all of the candidates to be strong
advocates.
<p>
But I think, as Marie and Rick have stated, this is
a philosophical divide where these people do genuinely believe
that families are better equipped to spend that money than the
government and that families can provide for family members better
than the government.  So that is really what is driving the issue.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And from all of you, is that a tough case to make,
that families are better at providing?  I saw a thing on CNN this
morning where two liberals were laughing as though government
day care wasn't a good idea.  What kind of a fight are you having
to make to support the family in that context?
<p>
MS. WHEAT: What you see is that it plays well outside the beltway. It 
is the CNN pundits and the people that are on the media talk shows that
think a $500-a-child tax credit is a pipe dream or something that
they want to get off the table.
<p>
But out in real America, in our district, Steve Largent's district in 
Oklahoma, it resonates. People understand that a $500-a-child tax credit 
would let them keep more of their money and help them be able to raise their
children more effectively.
<p>
And so it is playing well.  The calls we get are in support of it 
overwhelmingly. So I think it's an inside-the-beltway versus 
outside-the-beltway, and the real people know that it's a good thing.
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: Do the Members of Congress feel that if they give the 
administration $200 billion of this, that it is going to go to reduce the 
deficit, or do they feel that it is going to go to spend more on various 
social programs?
<p>
MS. WHEAT:  We believe absolutely that it must go -- it has to
go to cut spending.  There has to be more deficit reduction; that
there is not an offset that you can make; that we have to get
the deficit under control.  And if they want to talk about tax
cuts, if they do want to talk that way, we pay for our tax cuts
-- quote, unquote.  Any of the cuts that we made, we cut spending,
if you want to get into that lingo.  I hate to digress into that.
 But if Clinton wants to spend more, let him cut more.  That's
the bottom line.
<p>
MR. DEARBORN:  Right.  Yes, we would say the same thing.  I would also 
piggyback on what Marie had said about family tax relief and how it resonates, 
I think, around the country. At the Heritage Foundation, we broke it down, 
family tax relief, as far as a $500-per-child tax credit by congressional 
district and also by county, and the one thing that we noticed is when
we gave that information to the press, all the local papers across
the country would literally just rewrite all of it in their columns
saying that Kenosha County receives X million in family tax relief,
and folks would write in and say, &quot;I had no idea that that
is what this family tax relief meant.&quot;
<p>
So, I mean, people outside the beltway -- you know, I agree with Marie -- I 
think understand what $1,000 more in their pocket per year means.  It
is when we get inside the beltway and everyone up here decides
that they know how better to spend everyone else's money that
we start having the problems.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you see -- some people are trying to say the freshman class 
is going to change America.  Some people are saying they're already becoming 
inside-the-beltway types.  What is your perspective?  I mean, pro-family tax 
relief seems to indicate that they are fighting strong.
<p>
MR. DEARBORN: I would say -- I do the Senate side, so I have kind of -- I 
can stand back and look and see what the House has done and compare
it to what the Senate has done.  A lot of people are saying that
the Senate is kind of the black hole for the House of Representatives,
and to a certain degree, I think they are absolutely right.  I
mean, there are some solid, good freshmen on the Senate side,
but when I see what the House does, I am just astounded that,
first of all, they are doing so much in such a short period of
time that is so revolutionary, I don't think they have a chance
to, first of all, catch their breath to become institutionalized;
and secondly, when they do start catching their breath, there
is something that happens on the Senate side that monkeys up what
they have already done on the House side, so they have to come
back and try to fix it again.
<p>
And I am not trying to be down on the Senate because, day in and day out, 
that's what I work with, are the folks on the Senate side, and there are 
some great warriors over there.  But for the most part, I think these House 
guys have just been phenomenal and really fighting hard for their 
constituents.
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  So many of them came here because they were
genuinely committed to change something.  They didn't come here
to be career politicians.  They came here to get a job done, and
then they are ready to go back home to their families.
<p>
MR. DEARBORN: Yes.  I mean, look how many of them have already said, 
&quot;Look, I'm doing the term limits things.  I'm a citizen legislator.
I'm going to serve my couple of terms up here and then I'm going
to go back, because I have a business back home, or I plan on
doing X back home.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That does seem to me a big change in the practical side.
<p>
We have about a minute left in our show.  What would you like people to 
understand about what has been happening here in this sausage-making process 
of tax reform, in the last minute?
<p>
MS. WHEAT:  I would say call your Congressman and call your Senator and tell 
them that you want tax cuts and that it is vital and it is important.
<p>
MR. DEARBORN: I would agree, and just say we should not be spending a dime
more on any of these programs.  You are talking $12 trillion over
the next seven years.  If anything, we should be putting that
money back in folks' pockets, and I would urge people to call.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And you think we can save the $500-per-child tax
credit, as much as it is under attack by the media, perhaps, more
than -- 
<p>
MS. WHEAT:  When Members hear, they listen.
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: I guess the other thing I would point out -- Marie alluded 
to it a moment ago -- is that the $500-per-child tax credit and the
other family relief has nothing to do with Medicare.  Those tax
cuts were paid for early on with some of the other discretionary
spending cuts.  Medicare is a separate issue.  That is something
that needs to be dealt with but has nothing to do with the family
tax relief.
<p>
MR. DEARBORN:  No connection whatsoever.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It is controversial, but I appreciate your all's help on that.
<p>
Please join us after the commercial break as we discuss another
pivotal and historic issue, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act.
 Stay with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Since the Supreme Court made the historic <i>Roe v. Wade</i> 
abortion decision in 1973, few congressional sessions have been so momentous. 
But it was a tough fight for life.
<p>
Within days of coming to office in 1992, Bill Clinton signed executive orders 
liberalizing abortion as never before.  Despite his extremely pro-abortion 
policies, the pendulum has swung back a few degrees on some key abortion 
issues.
<p>
Earlier this year, Family Research Council was a leader in the
nomination fight involving Dr. Henry Foster.  On the heels of
the controversial Surgeon General, Joycelyn Elders, Clinton nominated
another radical, a Tennessee gynecologist who had worked with
and on behalf of Planned Parenthood during most of his career
and was involved in a teen sex eduction project that had resulted
in even higher teen pregnancy rates.
<p>
The Foster fight came down to the wire, and only a few Senate votes held 
off the nomination. Still, Congress had had enough of the Surgeon General's 
office. After much rancorous debate, the House voted to defund the office,
saying it was too political and unnecessary.
<p>
Also at play in the budget debate, on the House side, tremendous pro-life 
gains were made in the spending bills under consideration.  Pro-family 
leaders were able to pass more than 10 pro-life-related measures, mostly
dealing with ending or restricting federal funding for abortion.
<p>
However, the biggest pro-life loss came from a Planned Parenthood
gold mine.  Title X of the Public Health Service Act is supposed
to work on reducing teen pregnancy and promoting family planning.
 But the program enacted, favoring condom giveaways and sex advice,
has instead been connected to increases in every teen reproductive
health category, from AIDS to sexually transmitted diseases of
all kinds, to pregnancy rates.
<p>
Although the GOP-headed House Appropriations Committee was able to defund the 
failed title X program and transfer the money to another program for needy 
women and children, a floor fight led to a narrow pro-life defeat, 207-221. 
The Senate also supported the controversial title X program.  And so it 
continues.
<p>
But the biggest victories this year have been in a battle that
isn't over yet.  On November 1, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly
passed the Partial-Birth Abortion Act, H.R. 1833, by a vote of
288-139.  The historic vote was the first time since abortion
on demand was legalized in 1973 that Congress voted to ban a particular
procedure.
<p>
Doctors use the partial-birth abortion procedure beginning
at 20 weeks and all the way through full term, nine months of
pregnancy.  The baby is delivered all but the head.  If the head
came all the way out, it would be considered a human being.  A
scissors is jammed into the base of the child's skull, and living
brain matter is suctioned out.
<p>
This horrific procedure is still under consideration by the Senate, with a 
vote expected at any time.  Although the outcome is hopeful, the real 
victories have come from informing the American people about what goes on 
behind the closed doors of an abortion clinic.
<p>
Abortion has always been an extremely controversial issue, and joining me 
to discuss current changes taking place in the pro-life battle is Cathy Deeds, 
Deputy Director of Government Relations for the Family Research Council;
and Congressman-doctor Tom Coburn from Oklahoma, who, along with
other pro-life Congressmen, positively impacted the Partial-Birth
Abortion Ban Act vote.
<p>
Thank you so much for joining us. That's a little hard to say ten times fast.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN:  It is.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I was at the news conference when you unveiled
this piece of legislation, and at the time, I thought I would
love to see it pass; I don't know if it could.  And here we are
today.  What prompted you to bring this to where it is?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: Well, first of all, I shouldn't take credit. I just
supported the effort.  I think some very thoughtful people came
up with the idea, how do we really show the American public what
abortion is?  And this particular, the worst case of abortion
-- it is all bad, but this worst-case issue is one where we can
actually show -- you can no longer deny what is happening to human
beings and human life with this procedure.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, you are, as well as being a Congressman, an 
obstetrician-gynecologist, so you have certainly seen many births.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: I personally delivered 3,000 babies.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Three thousand.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN:  I delivered seven over the weekend, this
weekend.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: A hobby.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: Well, it's not a hobby.  I am a citizen-based 
legislator, and I don't plan on being here very long, and I want to keep 
my skills and at the same time be based in my district, based on what I
do, which is a doctor.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That is fantastic.
<p>
So did you find -- one thing I found compelling, if you could tell us
a little about with the child, that in these late-term abortions,
the pain sensors in the child, they are not completely developed
in a rather horrible way.  Could you tell us a little bit about
that?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN:  Well, I think the important thing
is that this is -- even though others would want us to think that
this is a benign procedure for the infant, both in terms of the
anesthetic that might be applied and also in terms of the maldeveloped
pain fibers, that the opposite of that is actually the case, and
there has been some controversy over the anesthetic, and it is
important that women who are listening to this understand that
we can safely give general anesthesia to a woman without harming
her baby.
<p>
Some of the testimony that has been quite inaccurate
and unfortunate, that they would put forth untruths in terms of
that, could lead women to make a poor choice about needed surgery
during their pregnancy, so they should not do that.  We can give
anesthesia safely during pregnancy.
<p>
But I think more importantly is the fact that the fetus does in fact 
experience the extreme pain associated with this; that the nerve fibers 
are developed and that the anesthesia that a woman might receive locally 
has no impact at all in terms of protecting the fetus from that.
<p>
But why would somebody worry about pain if they're talking about 
terminating their life in the first place?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN:  And so there is all this paradox of what are we 
talking about and how do we raise the level of awareness of this human
life.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Of what happens.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: Of what actually happens.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Cathy, you have been working on this a lot.  What is the 
status right now?  It has obviously passed the House, thanks to the work 
of Congressman Coburn and others.  Where are we?
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  What we are talking about, obviously, as we described it, is 
such a horrible procedure. I mean, we are talking about a baby who is 
partially born, and the Supreme Court never addressed that situation when 
they legalized abortion, unfortunately.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  But I think that is why you find -- I mean, we were very, very 
pleased with the House vote.  We had 288 people voting for it.  Lots of
traditionally pro-abortion members crossed over, supported the
ban, I think because of an ad campaign that we are running, really
getting the word out about what this procedure does.  They were
seeing that this is killing a live baby while it is being born.
<p>
So that was the victory in the House, and we were very pleased
about that, and it is --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now we are to the Senate.
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  Yes, it's coming up in the Senate very quickly, possibly
as early as next week.  So we really have been working on the
Senators.  It is a tougher battle over there, because the Senate
has different rules, and therefore, they are able to amend the
bill, and we fear amendments that would weaken or gut the bill.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  As a citizen legislator, are you a little surprised
by the difference in the rules between -- especially when it comes
to a horrific thing like this, partial-birth abortions?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: Well, I would say, as one of the freshman Members 
of Congress, I have lots of disappointment in the rules of the Senate,
not necessarily in the Senators that are supporting some of these
critical issues for our country.
<p>
But what we need to do is to change the Senate, in my opinion, and to try 
to get people that are reflective of what our society's views are today. 
<p>
The real issue is, not very many people can say that it is okay to perform
a partial-birth abortion if in fact you know what it is, and the
real issue around abortion is let's not know what it is; therefore,
we don't have to deal with it.  And that is what is so important
about this ban.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You know, that was what was so interesting
during the floor debate on that, where one of the first things
out was Pat Schroeder trying to say, &quot;Let's not show what
we're talking about.&quot;
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And the very first vote out of the box had to be, Oh,
this is what we're talking about; these are the pictures.
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  To be on the charts.  There were big charts blown up for
people that may have not seen that.
<p>
But that is what -- I mean, I just need to commend Congressman Coburn 
because he has been such a leader, but especially to have a doctor, a 
practicing doctor, up there, even though this is not, of course, a recognized 
medical procedure, especially the partial birth.  All abortions we don't
think would be recognized, but to have you up there -- and I know
you talked to a lot of Members and Senator Frist on the Senate
side.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  I think that is helpful to some of the Members.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: I think the other thing that is important, if I 
deliver a child that is 24, 26 weeks, I am obligated as a physician to
do everything I can to keep that child alive.  And we take the
same child, turn it around in the womb, and pull its feet out
and its body out and then puncture its cranium and suck its brains
out and say that never was alive.
<p>
There is a tremendous paradox. You know, the tension has to build on that, 
and that is why I am very thankful, not so much that we passed this bill, 
that the American public is now willing to look at what we really do when
we abort babies.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I think that has been the biggest victory, frankly, the fact 
that we are just talking about late-term abortions. Yes, they happen; in 
fact, 77 percent of the American people think there aren't abortions past 
the first three months, the first trimester.
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  We should say -- I mean, of course, we in the Family Research 
Council and all the pro-life groups, we are opposed to all abortions. I 
mean, every abortion takes an innocent human life.  This particular abortion 
procedure is so heinous, as we talked about, but it is a starting point.
<p>
As we can see, we did get an overwhelming number in the House, and
we hope, we assume, that the Senate will follow along with that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And we may see a Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act
come up in the Senate as early as Monday.  What do you think,
looking to the next session of Congress, Cathy and Congressman
Coburn, what kind of pro-life activity do you think might come
up next session?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN:  Go ahead, Cathy.
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  Well, I mean, certainly, as the little piece mentioned,
we certainly have ongoing, unfortunately, ongoing pro-life battles,
mainly in the funding bills that fund Congress to get abortion
restrictions.  We will probably still have to continue with those,
hopefully maybe make some of those permanent, because right now
they are an annual fight, since these are annual funding bills.
<p>
I think we are talking with pro-life leaders and other pro-life
groups about looking at some other proactive or offensive-type
measures that get at the heart of the abortion procedure, other
types of limits.  We are talking about those, but definitely we
would certainly like to be more on the offensive, but we do have
a pro-abortion President.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes, we do.
<p>
MS. DEEDS: So we do have a difficult time.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN:  We also -- we have an absolute epidemic with 
sexually transmitted diseases.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes, we do.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: And although there, unfortunately, are not many 
forward-looking studies on the teaching that we now teach through title X 
funding, the retrospective analysis of that is that every state that spends 
more money on that has a higher incidence of teenage pregnancy, a higher 
incidence of unwanted pregnancy, a higher incidence of abortion, and a higher
incidence of HIV infection and --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It tracks the money.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN:  What it does is it tracks a loosening
of moral values.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: It gives a false sense of security.  The question to 
be asked is, when you go to doctors' groups who think that our policy is 
fine on AIDS, and you say, &quot;What's the best medical advice that
you would give your patient to prevent them from having a sexually
transmitted disease or getting pregnant or getting HIV?&quot;
they would say abstinence.  Why is that not our national policy
if that is the best medical advice?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is the best medical advice from a doctor, and I hope you all 
were listening. Pleased stay tuned for more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i> following this commercial break.  We will look ahead 
toward issues that face Congress in 1996.  Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>. I am now joined by Jacqueline Halbig,
FRC's Congressional Liaison; Cathy Cleaver, Director of Legal
Studies; and back with us is Marty Dannenfelser.  Thank you for
joining me.  I don't feel like I get to see enough of you all,
because everyone is running around all the time, and we're looking
ahead, what is going to happen next?
<p>
Cathy, we haven't talked to you.  We are actually going to be doing a whole 
show on your area in January.  But you are working on some pivotal projects.
 Tell us a little bit about what you see ahead in 1996.
<p>
MS. CLEAVER: Right.  I see a lot in the area of religious liberty.  I think
that is foremost in Americans' minds right now.  We have a state
of religious discrimination, and Congressman Hyde and Congressman
Istook are both working toward solving that problem by a Constitutional
amendment.  I think it is going to be a very interesting first
part of 1996 in terms of religious liberty.
<p>
Also, we see parental rights, a huge issue; very important to parents to get 
the government bureaucracies to play second in terms of who should decide how
to raise your children.  That is going to be a key issue, and
I also see that in early 1996.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What is kind of ironic about the Religious Equality or Religious 
Liberty Act is that a lot of people think, doesn't the First Amendment already 
give me those kinds of rights?  What is your answer to that?
<p>
MS. CLEAVER: Well, it does, absolutely.  The problem we are seeing is that
the Supreme Court has interpreted the First Amendment in such
a way that the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment mandates
discrimination against religious people or religious organizations.
<p>
That is not what our founding fathers intended, and that is not
what the literal language of the First Amendment would have us
see.  But we see, since the 1950s, increasingly, a sort of trend
by the Supreme Court in this misconstruction of the First Amendment.
 So a Religious Liberties Amendment would not change the First
Amendment; it would, rather, correct these misinterpretations.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Legislatively speaking, Marty, what is going to
need to happen to get this kind of religious liberties ball rolling?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, we're starting the ball towards hearings.
 There have been some hearings in the House and Senate so far,
and Congressmen Hyde and Istook have now introduced some amendments,
and they are going to be looking at hearings very soon, perhaps
before the end of the year, and then by early next year actually
moving the legislation in committee.  So we are going to have
to have a push at the grass-roots level to try to get positive
action.
<p>
But we do have some very good friends in people like Congressman
Canady, the subcommittee chairman, Congressman Hyde, and Congressman
Istook and others who are pushing for this.  So we are optimistic
about coming together and moving that legislation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Do you see a lot of support for it on the Hill?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: Yes.  Yes, there is very strong support.  I think that 
particularly this new Congress is very committed to the idea of families 
and religious faith.  They are realizing that people's religious faith
is so instrumental in framing their values, in framing what is
best for society, and that religion should not be put on the back
burner, should not be treated unfairly vis-a-vis every other type
of expression.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It is the kind of thing that comes up, just this week, a woman 
selling her son to pay a drug debt; last week, a woman cutting out a child of 
another woman because she wants a baby; and people say, how did we get this 
far? And it seems to be a lack of values and faith-based values.
<p>
Now, you are going to work on that, I know, Jacqueline, but what other
issues?  You are working on the Senate side, the House side. 
What issues are you tracking and do you see coming up?
<p>
MS. HALBIG: Well, I am concentrating on education reform as being a big 
issue in the second term of this session, and it is pretty exciting.
 We have before us -- our big goal with FRC is to repeal the federal
role in education -- and we have before us a few bills that will
tackle that.  One, in its embryonic stage, would get rid of the
Department of Education, and that is a first step.
<p>
But probably the biggest obstacle we have to this is President Clinton. 
If we can get through the House and Senate a bill that will get rid
of the Department of Education, we can pretty much expect that
it will be vetoed by President Clinton.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  But why would we want to get rid of the Department of 
Education? Some people say we need more standards, not less.  Don't we 
need a federal role?
<p>
MS. HALBIG:  Well, it's interesting.  Ever since the inception of the 
Department of Education, we have seen nothing but a decline in education. 
I mean, that is where all the studies came up that said, &quot;Oh, my 
goodness, we can't even compete with Germany and Japan anymore,&quot; and 
how interesting that that has all happened since the inception of the 
Department of Education.
<p>
So, clearly, education has declined since we have had a federal department. 
So to give power back to the local schools and parents is really where it's 
at.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I remember campaigning for Reagan in 1970-something, and we 
were talking about getting some changes in education.  Marty, you have been
around Washington, I hope, longer than me.  What do you think?
 Can we do that?  We have about 30 seconds left.
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: I think it is going to be very difficult to achieve those 
changes on Clinton's watch, but we have to begin framing the issues and
moving them through Congress and then explaining them to the general
public, and these things will grow as the public understands.
 A lot of this is tied together, empowering parents, not bureaucrats.
 Parental rights legislation, reform of education -- there is
so much from the philosophy.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So it is a values-based approach to the problems of, hopefully, 
the next century as we are nearing that point.
<p>
We are going to plan on having shows on all of these actually coming up, 
religious liberty in particular. One last thing as we are looking forward to 
a new session. I understand that Patricia Schroeder just said that she is not 
going to be back next time, and not the biggest pro-family advocate
we have ever had. Marty, what is your one thing that you would
say about Pat Schroeder?  Oh, well, sorry, we have to go.  But
we want to hear that.
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: Okay.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will take a look at the 
Family Research Council's press conference that took Banned Books Week by 
surprise. Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. FRC staff consistently 
is working on projects that will move the public debate beyond simple 
rhetoric. Charles Donovan, an FRC senior policy analyst, had the chance to do 
just that in a groundbreaking study that checked out liberal allegations
of book banning.
<p>
The report was released during National Banned Books Week in a September 
news conference, and it answers the question, Are classic literary works 
really being banned from libraries? Let's find out as <i>Straight Talk</i> 
brings you Home Front News.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: I am Kristi Hamrick, the Director of Communications for the 
Family Research Council, and we are very excited to have this opportunity,
as Paul Harvey would say, to &quot;tell the rest of the story.&quot;
<p>
This whole idea of censorship and banning books and some kind
of a hostile image of pro-family America, for the rest of America,
is not only laughable; it is not statistical.  I think we have
two good indications of what a pro-family America sees today happening
in our culture among the Banned Books Week concept.  We will have
some original research.  We will have some people talking about
their experience.
<p>
DR. DONOVAN: Thank you, Kristi.
<p>
I don't know whether it was our decision in Family Research Council or the 
National Press Club's. Of course, we are meeting in the First Amendment 
Room this morning, which is totally appropriate.
<p>
Before I get into a little bit of my statement, which I will try to keep 
brief because we are going a little long, I will say that if the
ALA had control of the Second Amendment and not the first, every
child would have a gun.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
It is a pleasure to be with you here this morning and to release the results 
of a survey conducted by Family Research Council.  It is an 18-month-long 
project that I undertook with a colleague of mine, William T. Spont.  Our 
basic qualifications are that we love books.
<p>
We noticed a trend, based on personal observation and talking with 
booksellers in New England, whereby a continuing number, an increasing number, 
in our view, of classic works of literature are finding their way into library
discard bins, book sales, used book stores, and the like.
<p>
We had one particular case where we were in a conversation with a New
England bookseller, major bookseller, and she showed us a volume
that was obtained from a library discard.  It was a $600 book
on the commercial market, essentially a rare book which the library
had for some reason chosen to dispense with.
<p>
That and a number of other impressions about the &quot;dumbing down&quot; 
of education and potentially the dumbing down of libraries struck us with 
the idea of conducting a national survey, which is what we did.  We
compiled a list of 100 major classic books of literature.  They
span a wide variety of topics:  art, architecture, literature
-- that is to say, fiction -- science, philosophy.
<p>
We took that list and sent it to over 500 libraries across the United 
States in all 50 states.  The only libraries we excluded -- and we are
talking public libraries -- the only libraries we excluded were
the very largest urban libraries:  Boston, Detroit, Chicago, and
so forth.  We presumed, based on some evidence, that they would
have the vast preponderance of these books.
<p>
We conducted a pilot survey in Massachusetts to test the list.  We also 
sent it to a couple of very good small collections in New England to verify
that the list was an achievable list.  We found that these small
collections both had a very high proportion of the books, approximately
80 percent.
<p>
We then waited for results.  It took two mailings.
 We got 204 responses from 49 states.  We promised -- I should
mention this -- we promised the individual libraries anonymity,
first of all because we don't want to be seen as critiquing or
criticizing any particular institution; secondly is the practical
concern that we wanted to encourage their cooperation.
<p>
I want to praise the libraries for their diligence in responding to 
us. A 40 percent response rate to any mailing nationally is extremely
good.
<p>
But these are very serious people in the libraries.  They
are very concerned about their collections, and a number of them
-- and these really are getting to our results -- a number of
them acknowledged to us in writing, in written comments on the
survey, that in fact classics do tend to disappear over time.
<p>
We found that, on average, the national average for libraries
other than urban libraries was something like 36 of 100 books.
 At least six libraries told us that as a result of our survey,
they went out and purchased books which they believed were on
their shelves at one time but that had disappeared.
<p>
Now, our basic point is not that there is book banning with respect to 
classics. In fact, this illustration of what is happening to classics 
illustrates how you can use the term &quot;banning&quot; quite loosely. 
We would not apply the term &quot;banning&quot; to these books.
<p>
What is happening -- we think it is of much more significant social
interest than many of the other controversies about literature
today -- is what we would call disappearing books.  In fact, we
think it would be more appropriate to have a disappearing high
education in the humanities week in the United States than to
have controversies week-long about whether or not public libraries
should buy Madonna's <i>Sex</i>.
<p>
In any event, let me give you a couple of examples. Einstein. Fifty-four 
percent of the libraries had Einstein's major work on relatively.  A 
similar proportion had Darwin's book on evolution, <i>The Voyage of the HMS 
Beagle</i>. The major works by Kepler on Copernican astronomy, 30 percent. 
Russo's <i>Social Contract</i>, one of the most important bases for the 
understanding of social policy in a democracy, under 50 percent.
<p>
What is happening to these books?  A variety of things happen to them. 
They deteriorate over time.  Books break down; they are discarded.  Some 
are not recognized by librarians as being important to the culture or
as being commercially valuable.  They are put on the discard or
what they call the deselection list.
<p>
Some are stolen. We have one incident with respect to the information raised 
by Focus onthe Family that was a case of theft.  Theft does happen.
<p>
So we concluded in our report that classics are especially subject to
deterioration; that in a time of constricted library budgets --
and I don't know whether they are constricted or not; it is a
point of fact that many libraries say they are -- it makes the
most sense for libraries not to discard some of the most important
works in their collection.
<p>
We recommend a number of steps be taken to reverse this.  First would 
be what we are doing here this morning, more media attention to the fact 
that there is a dumbing down of our libraries taking place.  And we also 
recommend what many librarians told me that they -- and we surveyed many 
of them by phone -- what they really find valuable.  They prize a cooperative
spirit in the community.  They see themselves as servants of the
community.
<p>
The vast majority of librarians are not presenting
<i>Playboy</i> to children, and they have no apologies about it.  They
are not buying it, or if they are buying it, they are putting
it on a reserve shelf.
<p>
So the vast majority of librarians we talked to are very concerned 
about this problem.  They want citizen cooperation. They love people 
who come in and who love books, and they rely heavily not on academic 
groups but on individuals who are simply widely read, many of whom -- 
one librarian told us he dealt with his classics problem by a fellow in 
the community who just loves philosophy.  He said, &quot;Well, go into the 
shelves. Tell me what I've got; tell me what I'm missing.&quot;  The gentleman
came back and gave him a list of major works in philosophy that
were missing.  He went out and bought them.
<p>
This is the way libraries are meant to work: to use all of the expertise of 
the community, to be sensitive to the values of the people in the community,
to make cooperative decisions.  And I want to say in closing that
most libraries do a very, very good job.  Most parents are very,
very concerned about their children.  Most of us, nearly all of
us, are concerned about educational quality.  If we are concerned
about those things, we will not complain about parents who care.
 We will do more to restore and strengthen our library collections.
<p>
Thank you very much.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i>, we are live from the Republican
National Convention.  It has already been an exciting few
days, and you have probably seen Gary Bauer, Family Research
Council's president, on many networks and on news shows. We
hope you have been watching the national policy debate and
seen Gary fighting for family issues during the Republican
platform hearings and on the floor of the convention.

<p>

Tonight we bring you more about those issues and
what the Republican Party promises for your family in the
future with some very special guests, including former 
Republican Presidential candidate, Ambassador Alan Keyes.

<p>

But first, let's go to Family Research Council's 
Kristin Hansen, who is live on the convention floor.
Kristin, I know that they have started the coverage. What 
do we have to look forward to this evening?

<p>

MS. HANSEN: Hi, Kristi. We are going to have so 
much fun this evening.  We have a great lineup of 
interviews.  We are going to be first talking with Rick 
Santorum and, hopefully, Senator Dan Coates later on.  We 
have the Young Republicans behind us.  So it is sure to be a 
fun evening.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Kristin, I can't wait to hear more, 
and we are going to be talking to Kristin throughout 
tonight's show.  But first I would like to introduce a key 
player in pro-life policies and the platform hearings, 
Colleen Parro, Executive Director of the Republican National 
Coalition for Life; and I am also joined by Marty 
Dannenfelser, who is Family Research Council's leader of our 
government relations.  Welcome, both of you.

<p>

Colleen, you all have been working for a long time 
getting us to this point.  The convention means, really, 
your work is done.  What has gone into getting us here, 
especially those interested in pro-life policies?

<p>

MS. PARRO: Well, a lot of hard work. We have 
reached out to pro-life Republican primary voters for the 
last five years, letting them know that the threat to the 
pro-life plank was real and that there was something that 
they needed to do about it.  We encouraged them to get 
involved in their precinct and county and state conventions; 
to get elected a delegate to the Republican National 
Convention, if possible, and many of them have done so; and 
in addition to that, to try to get on the Platform 
Committee, and many of them did that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So the pro-life platform that we saw 
come together last week was a five-year process.

<p>

MS. PARRO: Well, yes, actually. We have had a 
pro-life plank in the Republican Party platform since 1976 
calling for a human life amendment to the Constitution.  But 
the effort to overturn that really started in earnest by 
Republicans for Choice in 1992, and they have continued 
their efforts to try to strip the pro-life plank from the 
Republican platform.  We expect that they will continue to 
do that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I would think so.

<p>

MS. PARRO: And that is why it is so important for 
people to get involved in the process and to be here every 
four years to make the statement that this is the pro-life 
party.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Marty, you have been on Capitol Hill 
for 20-some years and now with Family Research Council.  How 
important is the platform in GOP politics?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, it is particularly 
important when you have a Republican President.  I can 
remember when Reagan and Bush were both in the White House 
and there were some staff who might have tried to steer them 
in one direction or another.  It was very helpful to be able 
to go back and say this is the position that is in the 
platform, and there would be letters signed by Members of 
Congress, and so on, that would reinforce that point.

<p>

So it is very important because it is a point at 
which people really get focused on policy.  You do hear a 
lot of people say, "Well, it is ignored after the 
convention."  But that is not really the case.  It really 
does set the blueprint for the policies that are in effect 
by the Congress but more particularly when you do have a 
President of the same party in the White House.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I know it hasn't escaped your 
attention, Colleen, that Vice President Al Gore and 
President Clinton at one time said they were both pro-life.
How do you help people remember their pro-life grass roots,
you might say?

<p>

MS. PARRO: Well, what is important for us to 
remember is that the platform is an excellent platform, and 
it is pro-life, but it takes grass-roots pressure from the 
bottom up to make sure that elected officials attempt, at 
least, to turn the principles in the platform into public 
policy and law.

<p>

We are seeing somewhat of an erosion of that 
support among the Republican leadership in Congress.  We 
cannot afford to let down on our job, which is to hold them 
accountable to the platform and to not be afraid to stand up 
to your local Congressman and say, "Hey, wait a second.  We 
want to restore the right to life in this country.  What are 
you doing to get that done?"

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, as somebody who has been on 
Capitol Hill, Marty, that kind of pressure, does that work?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: It does. Like I say, we would 
get Members of Congress to sign letters.  You might get 20, 
30, 40, 50 Members of Congress to point out in a letter to 
the White House, this was the position in the platform; this 
is the position that we expect to abide by.  It has been 
helpful to have that in there.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Standing by with Kristin Hansen, we 
have Senator Rick Santorum, a pro-life fighter, a real 
leader.  Senator, thank you so much for being with us on 
<i>Straight Talk</i>.

<p>

SENATOR SANTORUM: Well, thank you. It's good to 
be with you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Kristin, have the Senator talk to us 
about the importance of the kind of policy debate that we 
have seen take place over the last week.

<p>

SENATOR SANTORUM: Well, I think what we have come 
out and done in this convention with this platform is we 
have stood up for principle; that we have made very direct 
statements as to what the Republican Party believes in.

<p>

You know, I am a conservative who was elected in 
Pennsylvania, in a state where they say you cannot elect a 
conservative. What I found out, and what Spence Abraham 
found out in Michigan, and Mike DeWine in Ohio, is that what 
the voter wants is someone who is going to provide a clear 
vision for this country, who is going to stand up and fight 
for what they believe in.

<p>

They don't expect to agree with you on every 
issue.  But what they do expect you to do is to stand up and 
be honest, be forthright, and to deliver what you said you 
were going to do.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Senator, I am sure that you have 
seen that Jack Kemp is our new Vice Presidential candidate, 
used to represent New York, right on the border of 
Pennsylvania, a big football player.  Tell us, how do you 
think the Jack Kemp selection plays in Pennsylvania?

<p>

SENATOR SANTORUM: I think it will be very 
helpful.  Northwestern Pennsylvania, which obviously borders 
the Buffalo area and in fact gets a lot of the Buffalo 
television, is going to be a very strong area for us.  We 
just elected a governor from up in that area, and it is a 
swing area which we are going to do very well in now as a 
result of Jack.  Jack played football in Pittsburgh, frankly 
not very well. He only played five games for the Steelers.
But, you know, he lived there, he is known there a little 
bit, people remember him, and I think it will be a plus for 
him.

<p>

And just his message. I mean, Jack has such an 
inclusive message that is really going to help us in cities 
like Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, where we are going to 
reach into communities that frankly are not traditional 
Republican areas. So I think, overall, that vision, that 
energy is going to be very helpful in Pennsylvania.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One last question, Senator, and I 
really appreciate your taking the time to be with us.  There 
has been a lot of talk about inclusiveness in the big tent, 
but would the Republican Party be a pro-life party?  How 
would you describe its commitment on that issue?

<p>

SENATOR SANTORUM: Well, I don't think there is 
any question that the platform is clear.  I mean, we are a 
pro-life party, and the Democratic Party is a pro-abortion 
party. I don't use the term "pro-choice" because what the 
Democratic Party platform is, abortion on demand at any time 
during the pregnancy for any reason.  I mean, that is the 
extremist plank on abortion.  That is the plank on abortion 
that is well out of the mainstream, and I think we contrast 
very well with a party that says life is important, and that 
we stand up and we respect the right to life.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Fantastic!

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Senator, we had read that Dan 
Quayle, in his draft comments for this evening, was going to 
mention President Clinton's veto of the partial-birth 
abortion ban.  Have you heard anything more up to date on 
that?

<p>

SENATOR SANTORUM: I am not, but I am working 
very, very diligently on trying to override that veto.  I 
mean, the President allowing that barbaric procedure to 
occur is just -- what a horrible commentary it is on the 
moral leadership of this country, and frankly, if we don't 
override it in the House and Senate and the American public 
doesn't mobilize behind this, I think it is a horrible 
commentary on this country as a whole if we allow that to 
continue.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Thank you.

<p>

MS. PARRO: Senator, I have a question for you.  I 
am wondering, since Senator Dole the other day said that he 
had not yet read the platform and that, if he did, he would 
not feel bound by it, what efforts do you think are going to 
be made among Republicans to see to it that the Dole-Kemp 
ticket actually runs on the platform?

<p>

SENATOR SANTORUM: Well, you know, I think Bob 
Dole is making the statement like you would about a piece of 
legislation.  I haven't read every word of it, but I 
generally agree with its direction, and he is going to run 
on the themes and issues that were in the platform.

<p>

Bob Dole's record on the pro-life issue is 100 
percent; his record on most of the issues in the platform is 
right in line with that platform.  I mean, I think we 
shouldn't worry too much and picket our candidate.  I think 
what we should do is recognize that with a Bob Dole 
Presidency and with a Republican Congress, we are going to 
move forward on a lot of fronts that Bill Clinton is 
stopping us on right now.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Senator, as a former Pennsylvanian, 
I have to tell you that my parents are always telling me 
what a champion you are.  We really appreciate your being 
with us on <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>.

<p>

When we come back, we are going to have more, live from San Diego.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are very excited to have you back 
with us at <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>
where we are broadcasting live from the 1996 Republican 
National Convention.

<p>

We have Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell at the 
podium.  A lot of you may be watching.  There are a lot of 
issues that we are talking about here that affect you and 
your family, and we have been going to a lot of trouble to 
bring you some of the best in the business to give you 
insight into pro-family issues, other family issues.

<p>

I am joined by a very special guest, Ambassador 
Alan Keyes, and also Marty Dannenfelser from the Family 
Research Council.  Thank you.  It is a privilege to have you 
here with us.

<p>

How does it feel?  You obviously were making your 
way to San Diego, thinking perhaps that you would be 
candidate, and now you are here watching all this take 
place.  What kinds of thoughts are going through your mind?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, actually, my campaign, as 
I said repeatedly on the trail, was not so much about Alan 
Keyes becoming the nominee as it was about making sure this 
party stayed on track with its moral principles, its pro-life 
principles, that we had a strong pro-life plank in the 
platform, that we had a ticket in which the Vice 
Presidential candidate and others were not pro-abortion.

<p>

I think we have achieved all those objectives at 
this convention. I feel very pleased about that. I think 
there are, obviously, still some problems.  The convention 
organizers want to project, for reasons best known to 
themselves, an image of the party as a pro-abortion party  
that is not committed to the principles of the platform.  I 
think that is a great mistake.  But I think that we did 
succeed in making sure that the delegates who come to this 
convention are true to Republican principles.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I mean, it is quite a pendulum if 
you think about it.  We started with maybe Christine Todd 
Whitman and maybe Colin Powell as a Vice Presidential 
candidate and let's get rid of the platform to Jack Kemp and 
a strong pro-life platform.  Do you think that a lot of what 
you were talking about maybe might have changed that?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, I think it had an impact.
A lot of people were doing a lot of hard work in that
regard:  Phyllis Schlaffly, Gary Bauer, Jim Dobson, others
who had the courage and heart to speak up and to send a
clear, strong signal to Bob Dole, to the Republican Party
leadership, that the grass-roots Republicans were not going
to tolerate an abandonment of the pro-life principle and
that that would not be the best route for the Republican
Party.

<p>

I think, in any case, this fear of the pro-life 
issue on the part of the leadership is inexplicable, since 
the pro-life position has been our position, as we have 
gained strength all around the country, won Presidential 
elections, taken back the Congress.  I think if they pretend 
that there is some political liability involved here, it is 
a lie and they know it, and that some of them are doing it 
simply because they are not really committed to the moral 
principles that then lead to the pro-life position.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Marty, you have seen the impact of 
Presidential races on Capitol Hill.  What happens as leader 
like Ambassador Keyes speak out on the life issue?  What 
kind of buzz happens on Capitol Hill?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, it emboldens people who 
support the pro-life position, and it is very encouraging to 
those pro-life Members of Congress who sometimes get 
discouraged by their own leadership's lack of willingness to 
speak out on the issues.  So it is important to have people 
with the moral courage of Alan Keyes out there speaking 
forthrightly to the issues and speaking with clarity as to 
why this is so central to our national purpose.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have been talking to a lot of the 
delegates about why they are here, and it was interesting 
that more than half, almost 60 percent of the delegates, are 
first-time delegates.

<p>

As we have been doing some of the pro-life 
activities through RNC for Life and, obviously, Gary Bauer 
at Family Research Council talking to them, a good many of 
them got into this just because of their concern for the 
unborn.  And yet, earlier today, I was in Voice of America 
in a debate where a gentleman from Republicans for Choice 
was telling me that the abortion issue is a killer for the 
Republican Party.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, you know, that is, as I 
say, the simple lie that has been spread.  I don't believe 
that even the people who tell that lie think that it is 
true, since all of the polling that was done after 1992 
showed pretty clearly that the pro-life position did not 
hurt George Bush; it was his stand on taxes and his failure 
to keep his no-new-taxes pledge that hurt him.

<p>

It is also clear that, in 1994, overwhelmingly, 
pro-life, moral Republicans accounted for our ability to 
take the Congress from the Democrats.  How can that be a 
political liability?  It makes no sense.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have standing by Kristin Hansen 
on the convention floor.  Kristin, whom do you have with you 
now?

<p>

MS. HANSEN: Hi, Kristi. Right here with me I 
have Mr. Marco Gillam(?).  Mr. Gillam, where are you from?

<p>

MR. GILLAM: San Antonio, Texas.

<p>

MS. HANSEN: San Antonio, Texas?  And why have you 
come here to the convention?

<p>

MR. GILLAM: I am an alternate from the 20th 
Congressional District.  We don't have a Congressman there 
because his name is Henry D. Gonzalez.  We want to get more 
Republicans in the Congress.  We want to get a Republican in 
the White House.

<p>

MS. HANSEN: And what have you got here?  Oh, 
you're wearing a hat.  What does the hat say?

<p>

MR. GILLAM:  The hats are distributed by the 
Republican National Coalition for Life, a pro-life 
organization, and most of the Texas delegation is wearing 
it.  Fortunately, they go with our ties and our Texas 
accents.

<p>

MS. HANSEN: How do you think the Dole-Kemp ticket 
will do in Texas?

<p>

MR. GILLAM: They will carry Texas easily.  We are 
very excited that Jack Kemp is aboard.  I feel we are going 
to go forward together now and defeat Bill Clinton.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Mr. Gillam, how do you feel the life 
issue plays in Texas?  Do you see any kind of a drag on the 
ticket?  Certainly a lot of media coverage this week has 
indicated that it has been a bad thing for the GOP.  What is 
your position?

<p>

MR. GILLAM: What, the pro-life issue, did you say?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  That is correct.

<p>

MR. GILLAM: I think the majority of Texans are 
pro-life.  I know our delegation and the grass roots we 
represent who elected us up the line are opposed to 
abortion, especially partial-birth abortion.

<p>

It is an exaggerated issue. The pro-abortionists, 
I feel, are basing their arguments strictly on emotion.  I 
don't think it is going to be a drag.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Marty, how have you seen -- as the 
different delegations have been put together, some have 
tried to say that it is not that the majority of Americans 
are pro-life but that they control the process.  Do you 
think that is accurate?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, the pro-life people have 
been very committed to getting their people elected during 
this process.  That part is true.  But I think you see all 
too often that the network camera people and the talking 
heads in the news booths are very much out of step with the 
American people on the life issue, and they repeatedly frame 
the issue in a way that is not really representative of the 
true pro-life position.  But the grass roots do oppose most 
abortions in most circumstances, and the polls have been 
showing that repeatedly.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Mr. Gillam, you are standing by, I 
know.  Have you seen the life issue to be the majority 
position of your fellow statesmen, or do you think it is 
that you have been more involved in the process?

<p>

MR. GILLAM: Could you repeat the question?  I 
could barely hear you, Kristi.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Sure. Do you think that the pro-life 
position is that of the state of Texas, or do you think 
you guys have just been more active in the process?

<p>

MR. GILLAM: I can't hear hardly at all.

<p>

MS. HANSEN: Okay.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, Mr. Gillam, thanks so much for 
being with us, and I am going to ask that same question to 
Ambassador Keyes.  Ambassador, what is your perspective?  Do 
we control the process or do we have the philosophy on our 
side?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, two things are true.
One, I think it is true that pro-life moral conservatives 
are more active in the process.  That also means, of course,
come election day, they are going to be more active in 
distributing the literature, more active in carrying people 
to the polls, more active in knocking on doors, more active 
in spreading the word.  So their activism goes beyond the 
pro-life issue and really becomes the key asset for 
Republicans on election day, the activism of that moral 
conservative core of the party. Without them, I don't think 
we can win victories.

<p>

I also think that the election results would 
suggest that this business of pro-life being somehow not the 
view of the people is wrong.  If that is the case, why is it 
that pro-life conservatives can stand up, run for office, 
and win?  Why did they win overwhelmingly in the course of 
the 1994 election?  Why is it that not a single pro-life 
incumbent in the Congress was defeated on the Republican 
side in that election?

<p>

So I don't understand where these arguments come 
from when the facts simply don't track with this notion that 
the pro-life position is a political liability.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: You know, yesterday there was 
another primary in the state of Colorado, and the pro-life 
candidate in the Republican primary won a very decisive 
victory against a pro-abortion candidate.  A week earlier, 
there were three pro-life candidates in the states of 
Kansas, Georgia, and Michigan that won their victories, and 
it was a clear-cut challenge between pro-life and pro-abortion 
in all three cases.

<p>

So time after time we have seen this. We saw Pete 
Wilson and Arlan Specter run in the Presidential race.  
Their candidacies went nowhere, and it came down to 
competition between several pro-life candidates.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have a call on the line.  It is 
Nancy from New York.  Nancy, do you have a question for 
Ambassador Keyes or a comment about what we are watching 
right now?

<p>

CALLER FROM MILESSES, NEW YORK: Well, Ambassador 
Keyes, I think you're great.  I love you.  I would have 
voted for you or a libertarian, but I don't like the 
libertarian view on a strong defense.  I think that is 
imperative.

<p>

But I wanted to say is I don't know why you give 
the courtesy to the Democratic Party to say they are pro-choice. 
They are pro-death.  To me, pro-choice is my choice 
between abstinence and free sex.  When you get under that 
umbrella, it is either pro-life or pro-death.  It is the 
guilt of the women in America.  We don't understand there is 
grace for us, and the inability of us to say, "We were 
wrong.  It's death.  I'm guilty.  Forgive me."  That's it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Nancy, that is a very interesting 
point that you raise, and I want to make a point for all of 
you watching that you can call if you call 1-800-5000-NET 
with a question for Ambassador Keyes, who is going to stay 
with us through the show.

<p>

But, Ambassador, what is your response to Nancy's point?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I think she is correct.
Generally speaking -- I mean, I don't know if I said 
something to the contrary just a few minutes ago -- but I 
use the phrase "pro-abortion," not "pro-choice."  I think 
that the pro-choice slogan was a very shrewd one.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: In one way it does raise an 
issue, because I think what these people represent is the 
view that freedom consists of making any choice you please, 
and we know that if you define it that way, it then becomes 
a curse because it implies that there is no responsibility, 
no moral discipline, and that in turn undermines your 
ability to maintain a decent society and strong institutions 
in that society like the family.

<p>

So I think in that respect the notion that they 
are pro-choice does convey something about their 
irresponsibility.  But the truth is, in this context, they 
are pro-abortion and pro-death, just as the caller says, and 
generally speaking, I use that phrase "pro-abortion" because 
I think that this notion that I am against abortion but, 
which then leads to a tolerance for the sanctioning of this 
as a legal matter, that basically is a cop-out, and it 
leaves the evil abroad, which means that you support its 
existence.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have another caller on the line.
1-800-5000-NET for you to call and participate in this to 
ask a question for Ambassador Keyes or make a comment about 
what is going on behind us.

<p>

Again, we are live from San Diego.  We are going 
to look forward to talking with you.  Stay tuned as <i>Straight
Talk</i> brings you more of the national GOP convention.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Tonight we are live from the 
Republican National Convention, where we are talking to a 
true warrior for America's families, Ambassador Alan Keyes, 
and Marty Dannenfelser, our Director of Government Relations 
at Family Research Council.

<p>

Behind us, former Governor Carroll Campbell is 
talking, but I understand that Kristin Hansen has a special 
guest with her.  Kristin, you have Senator Coates with you?

<p>

MS. HANSEN: Yes. Hi. I am down here on the 
floor with Senator Dan Coates of Indiana, definitely a 
champion of the pro-family movement.

<p>

Senator, we have been here with the Family 
Research Council working with the platform hearings, and we 
were definitely happy with the way things went last week.
And now I know definitely people in the pro-family movement 
are interested in the Dole-Kemp ticket, and how are they 
going to stick to the platform in the next couple of months 
and in their campaign?  What do you think we are hoping to 
see with the Dole-Kemp ticket and the platform?

<p>

SENATOR COATES: You know, we were all pretty 
happy with the way the platform came out, and it is a 
document that I think forms the foundation of our party, 
what we believe and where we think the party ought to go, 
where America ought to go.

<p>

But the reality of it is not that piece of paper.
It is the translation of that paper into the reality of 
action of legislation, of carrying out the basis for all the 
various agendas and programs that are incorporated in that 
document.  That has to be a decision of the President, the 
Vice President, and the party to say we are going to take 
that piece of paper and we are going to turn it into 
reality.  That is our job, to make sure that that happens.

<p>

I really believe that the Dole-Kemp ticket and the 
people they will surround themselves with will advocate what 
we believe and share in our beliefs in terms of 
demonstrating to the American people that we care about the 
values, the underlying fundamental values that are important 
to the future of this country.

<p>

MS. HANSEN: What do you think people in Indiana 
are looking for in action under the Dole-Kemp ticket, 
especially families?

<p>

SENATOR COATES:  Well, I think they want to see a 
recognition of the fact that the family is the most 
important building block of society.  There is no government 
agency that will replace the family.  And, therefore, what 
we can do to strengthen the family, both through the tax 
code, through government policies that don't impact 
negatively on the family but rather encourage family 
formation, a strong declaration that the family is the 
essential foundation of America and we are not going to 
broaden that definition to include all different forms of 
what some people think constitutes a family, I think those 
are essential elements of what ought to be done in the next 
four years.

<p>

Also, I think we have to recognize that the family 
is torn asunder these days in many of our communities, in 
many of our neighborhoods.  And to the extent that we can 
reach out with proactive, conservative social programs, many 
of which I have outlined in my Project for American Renewal, 
to strengthen the family, I think that we need to take an 
active voice.

<p>

So there is a lot that we can do to change the 
definition and the direction that this current 
administration has taken in regard to the family and bring 
us back to a traditional base.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Kristin, if you can hear me, or 
Senator Coates, Senator, you are well known for working on 
welfare reform and on compassionate and community 
involvement.  How do you think welfare reform is going to be 
a part of this coming election battle?

<p>

SENATOR COATES: Well, the resolution that we have 
come up with in Congress and that Bill Clinton has signed is 
a recognition that the American people's voice has been 
heard as far as the White House, and Bill Clinton 
politically could not afford not to sign that.

<p>

I have defined this as step one of the welfare 
revolution.  We have taken the important step of 
transferring power out of Washington back to the states.  We 
have taken the important step of telling people that we are 
no longer going to allow them to live a lifetime of 
dependence on the Federal Government paying the bills; that 
they are going to have to get a job, they are going to have 
to take responsibility for their children, they are going to 
have to take responsibility for their lives.  We will help 
them in the transition, but it is a transition, and there is 
an endpoint to it.

<p>

But the second step ought to be to energize those 
institutions like the church, like the family, like 
volunteer associations, like Habitat for Humanity, church- 
or faith-based organizations to deal with some of these 
social problems that break down the family that government 
has not successfully dealt with.

<p>

We have spent trillions of dollars at the federal 
level with lousy results, terrible results, so we have 
condemned people to lifetimes of dependency.  And yet there 
are organizations across America that don't rely on 
government for their funding and for their ideas that are 
just reaching out with Christian love, reaching out with an 
involvement of themselves in other people's lives and 
bringing the transforming power that spiritual renewal can 
bring to lives, and that is where our future is in terms of 
how we deal with a lot of these problems.  They will not be 
solved in Washington.  Washington can feed the body, but it 
cannot feed the soul.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Senator, thank you so much for being 
with us today on <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>.

<p>

SENATOR COATES: Sure.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We really appreciate that, and 
thanks for your leadership on welfare reform.

<p>

SENATOR COATES: Thank you very much.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Ambassador Keyes and Marty both, how 
do you think welfare reform debate and those kinds of values 
issues are going to play and have been playing?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I think that it is kind of hard 
to see how welfare reform is going to be an issue in this 
election campaign given that the Congress and the President 
just agreed on a welfare reform effort which they passed, 
and you saw it.

<p>

That, by definition, kind of knocks the issue off 
the table as a point of difference, unless Bob Dole can 
define a bold proposal that would take things further than 
they have been taken as yet by the Republican Congress 
working with the President.

<p>

I think that is one of the dangers of progress in 
terms of reaching agreement on an issue just before an 
election.  Sometimes people say that prevents any progress 
from taking place before election time, but clearly, both 
the Congress and the President in this case thought that it 
was smarter for them to be seen doing something in an 
election year than just fighting about it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: But, Marty, we at the Family 
Research Council, and you in particular, have been working 
on things like the family cap and dealing with not extending 
additional benefits as more children are born out of wedlock 
into the home.  Why have you seen the family cap as being 
important in welfare reform, and where is that right now?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, the parliamentary process 
in getting the bill passed prevented that family cap from 
being included in the final product.  It was in the bill 
that was passed by the House of Representatives, but it got 
knocked out under a parliamentary objection in the Senate 
because of the process they were using to get the bill 
passed.

<p>

However, the bill does take away the need for many 
of the states to go hat in hand to the Federal Government to 
get waivers to implement that family cap and other similar 
proposals at the state level.  So that will probably be a 
boost that the states can do these things more on their own.

<p>

I think another interesting question is going to 
be what happens down the road, because some of these 
programs are going to remain in place for a few years and 
then be phased out, and there was a battle between the 
Clinton White House and the Congress about whether or not to 
extend the benefits after five years, and they did allow 
them to use federal funds through some other programs other 
than welfare after five years.  So that is still going to be 
something to see if there is an effort to maintain this 
federal support for welfare, or will it truly be turned over 
to the states at the end of that time period?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It seems like family tax relief has 
been the favorite theme of the Republican convention to 
date, but a lot of moral issues -- life, welfare reform -- 
have been very hard-fought and hard-won.  We are going to 
talk about what other issues we think are important in this 
next election cycle.

<p>

Remember, if you are watching at home, you are 
welcome to call us at 1-800-5000-NET.

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we are going to hear 
more from Alan Keyes and Kristin Hansen and Marty 
Dannenfelser, more here live at the Republican National 
Convention.  Join us after the break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i> is back with more live coverage of the 
Republican National Convention.  We are talking to you from 
the convention floor, and we are joined by a man who has his 
own followings of supporters amongst the Republican Party, 
Ambassador Keyes.

<p>

We have Kristin Hansen on the convention floor,
but we also have a caller on the line from Vermont. Hi.
Welcome to <i>Straight Talk</i>.

<p>

CALLER FROM FAIRLEE, VERMONT:  Hi.  Ambassador 
Keyes, it is a distinct honor to address to you two short,
interrelated questions:  If abortion is considered a woman's 
private choice, then why is it paid for with public funds?
Isn't this taxation without representation?  Thank you very 
much.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I think it is a very good 
question.  I think it really makes us all, as supporters of 
the public treasury, complicit in a choice that many people 
regard as immoral and that they are saying is entirely the 
private choice of that individual.  But if it is entirely a 
private matter, why should it be supported with public 
funds?  There is a contradiction there, and I think that 
contradiction actually points to the fact that this is not a 
private matter at all; that it is in fact a matter of 
concern because it violates an important public principle of 
justice, which is that all men are created equal and endowed 
not by their mothers' choice but by the Creator God with 
their unalienable rights.

<p>

So I think you are right; that is a contradiction 
that shows that within that pro-abortion position there is a 
self-confessed error where they try to say it is a private 
thing and then want to support it with public funds.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Let's take another call now, Ed from 
Pittsburgh.  Ed, are you with us?

<p>

CALLER FROM PITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA:  Yes, I am here.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And what is your question or comment?

<p>

CALLER FROM PITTSBURGH: First of all, it is a 
distinct honor to speak with you, Ambassador Keyes. The 
first question I have is, were you or would you consider 
being a running mate for Senator Dole?  And the second 
question is, are we going to see you back on track in the 
year 2000?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, as I often told people, 
the man who thought that Colin Powell might be his first 
choice didn't have Alan Keyes second on his list.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

And I think it took, to tell you the honest truth, 
a lot of honest pressure from moral conservative groups to 
make it clear to Bob Dole that that pro-abortion temptation 
was a bad idea, and he finally ended up with Jack Kemp, who 
doesn't emphasize the pro-life issue, is not really a pro-life 
leader but at least has a solid record of support for 
the pro-life position.

<p>

So I think that that is about the best we could 
have hoped for, given the strong temptation that Bob Dole 
seemed to have in the other direction, and that, 
unfortunately, is also exemplified in the lineup at this 
convention, which seems to be afraid of standing forward and 
presenting to the American people the clear argument for the 
pro-life position, which I think is a unifying argument that 
inspires Americans.  It is not, as they are trying to make 
us believe, a divisive argument.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you very much, Ambassador.

<p>

We have another caller, Heather, in Fayetteville, 
Tennessee.  Heather, thanks for joining us on <i>Straight Talk</i>.
Your question or comment?

<p>

CALLER FROM FAYETTEVILLE, TENNESSEE: Yes. I
would like to know why, every time I turn on the TV and 
watch the convention, all I see is pro-abortion speakers.  I 
don't see any pro-life speakers.

<p>

I will say I cannot vote for Bob Dole, I will not 
vote for him, I don't trust him, and you know, as they say, 
to get elected you run conservative, and once you are in 
office, you govern liberal.  Bill Clinton did it.

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, that's what they say: run right and govern left.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I think the caller puts her 
fingers on something that I have been disturbed about, that 
many others have pointed out, have been disturbed at.  As I 
say, they are putting a pro-abortion face on the Republican 
Party in spite of the fact that the body is strongly pro-life, 
and they claim that this is because there is some 
political liability in the pro-life position, but that claim 
is not supported by the facts.

<p>

That would lead me to think that some of the 
leaders who are pushing us in this direction are doing it 
because they want to jettison the pro-life position because 
they do not believe in pro-life principles and because they 
are looking, I think, to form an immoral coalition between 
the forces of unbridled greed and the forces of unbridled 
lust, and I don't think that is going to be good for the 
country or good for the Republican Party, and I think they 
should stop it, and I will be recommending as much as I can 
to Bob Dole, to Jack Kemp, and to others that they 
understand the winning position for this slate is going to 
be one that points to Bill Clinton's anti-moral, anti-family 
positions and really drives home the fact that we need a 
better alternative, not one that emphasizes economics to the 
exclusion of morality.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to want to take some 
more callers in a moment, but first let's go to the 
convention floor. Kristin, you are standing by with Senator 
Rod Grams.

<p>

MS. HANSEN: Yes, we have Senator Rod Grams from 
Minnesota.  Senator, thanks so much for joining us.

<p>

SENATOR GRAMS: Thanks, Kristin. My pleasure to be here.

<p>

MS. HANSEN: I would like to ask you, we have 
heard a lot about hope, growth, and opportunity in the last 
couple of nights.  I would like to ask you, can we 
realistically cut the taxes 15 percent and reduce the 
deficit?  How will that help families, and how should 
families be watching that?

<p>

SENATOR GRAMS: Well, when we talk about cutting 
taxes, what are we really saying?  We are saying that we are 
going to let families and individuals keep more of the money 
that they work so hard for rather than sending it to 
Washington, so that they can be in control and make the 
decisions how best to provide for their children and their 
family needs. So we need to cut taxes to give them that 
opportunity.

<p>

Second, we need to reduce taxes so that we can 
have economic growth.  I mean, that money is going to be 
spent.  It is going to be spent by families and not by the 
government.

<p>

So it is not a question of either balance the 
budget or give tax relief; that is not an either/or.  The 
question is, we can increase this pie through economic 
growth so we can give tax relief, provide more revenues, 
because we will have more workers and lower taxes, and we 
can balance the budget.

<p>

So it is something that goes hand in hand. It is 
like a hand-in-a-glove type of mentality.  But when the 
Democrats say that we cannot afford to do it, what they are 
saying is the era of big government isn't over, and we want 
that money in Washington rather than in your pockets.

<p>

So it is very important.  There is a big 
difference between our agenda and theirs.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Senator, thank you so much for being 
with us.  Unfortunately, we have to go to a break shortly.
But do you think we will get that $500-per-child tax credit?

<p>

SENATOR GRAMS: Well, we have been working on it 
since 1993.  Bob Dole has made it a very important part of 
his tax package, and we have a lot of support both in the 
House and in the Senate.  So will we get it?  If Bob Dole is 
President, you can bet that that will be a part of our 
budget in 1997.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Senator, thanks for everything you 
are doing for the family.

<p>

SENATOR GRAMS: Thank you very much.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shares 
more about family issues being addressed here at the 1996 
Republican National Convention. Don't go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>, where we are watching Olympic 
heroes come out to the podium.  We are live from San Diego, 
where Washington, D.C., has been transplanted at the 
Republican National Convention, and we are reporting from 
the convention floor and talking with our special guest, 
Ambassador Alan Keyes, along with Marty Dannenfelser, who is 
leading government relations in Family Research Council.

<p>

First we have a caller. Caller, are you there?
Do you have a comment or a question? Steve, I understand.

<p>

CALLER FROM SAN PEDRO, CALIFORNIA: Right. Yes, I 
do.  First of all, I would like to thank you all very much, 
especially Ambassador Keyes, for taking this call.

<p>

I have a statement to make, then a recommendation, 
and then I am soliciting your comments.  The statement is, 
I am pro-choice, the choice being sex versus no sex, 
protected versus unprotected sex, which is then followed by 
personal consequences.

<p>

My recommendation is that if there is then a fetus 
or any other consequences, that the issue be framed in terms 
of pro-life versus pro-death.  And now I am looking for your 
comments.  Thank you.  But the pro-choice issue is sex 
versus no choice.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Ambassador, your response?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I have to say that there is a 
bumper sticker out there that I have always found a very 
good one, and it says, "I am pro-choice until after 
conception."

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That is right.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: And I think that that is 
exactly right. It emphasizes the fact that, unlike what 
they try to make us believe, there is an element of choice 
involved in this, but it is the element of sexual 
responsibility, and you are exercising a choice when you 
decide that, outside of marriage, you are going to engage in 
sexual activities; and if, as a consequence of that, a new 
life is coming into the world, that is not the point at 
which you get to make your choice.  That child is not a 
choice; it is an obligation.  And it does not belong to you, 
because it belongs to God, and God has determined both its 
life and its rights, and you are supposed to respect them.

<p>

And that, by the way, is not a personal statement 
of Alan Keyes; it is a statement of American public 
principle which we should respect as a people.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: A powerful sentiment, and one we 
haven't heard much of yet from the podium.

<p>

Theresa from Louisiana, do you have a question or 
a comment for us?

<p>

CALLER FROM SUGARTOWN, LOUISIANA: Yes. I want to 
tell Alan Keyes that I really admire him and that I agree 
with everything he says.  But I would like to hear his 
comments on this subject.

<p>

I just turned from CNN, and they were really
bashing the Republicans for Jack Kemp's flip-flop on
affirmative action and on the Prop 187 in California, and
they say that he is doing -- well, they quoted "Empower
America" as saying that he had switched on his own volition,
but they really bashed the Republicans for putting that spin 
on it, saying that he is being a good VP, and why don't they 
just admit that he is following Bob Dole's lead?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, you know, I guess I would 
have to say that it probably is of his own volition but that 
he has decided of his own volition to follow Bob Dole's 
lead, and that it is good to be honest about that.  I saw 
that headline and said, "Well, Jack is acting like a Vice 
President already," and that is exactly what he has to do, 
and he knew that when he accepted the position.

<p>

So I don't think it should come as a surprise to 
us or to anybody else.  George Bush had to do the same thing 
when he decided to accept the Vice Presidency with Ronald 
Reagan on some issues, and I think that is what it means to 
run as Vice President.  That is why you have to ponder it so 
hard before you accept that position.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Hold someone's hat and agree with them.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, the positions that Bob 
Dole and now Jack Kemp have on those two issues are 
consistent with the positions that are espoused in the 
Republican platform. So I think it is a good thing that the 
two candidates are now running in sync with the Republican 
platform.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We have a special guest standing by.
Kristin, I understand that you are down there with Senator 
James Inhofe.  Senator, thanks so much for being with us.

<p>

SENATOR INHOFE: Well, thank you. It's nice to be 
with you.  It's kind of fun here.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, I'm glad to hear it.

<p>

Tell us, Senator, as you take a look at a lot of 
the discussion of unity, I am sure there is a lot of 
excitement about the tax policy.  Do you think that pro-family 
conservatives are going to have a lot to be excited about, too?

<p>

SENATOR INHOFE: Well, yes. Oh, I think they 
ought to be really excited. You know, I gave a talk today 
to a group that is sponsored by Coke Industries, a very 
large group, and by coincidence I was to be on the platform 
speaking with Jack Kemp.  That was set up before Jack Kemp 
became the nominee for Vice President.  So we had a chance 
really to talk about these things in a spirited way.

<p>

I think when you look at the tax cuts that are 
right out of the chute that Bob Dole proposed, that is very 
pro-family, you know, the $500 tax credit per child and the 
reduction in taxes, the whole idea.

<p>

I was at a town hall meeting in Sapulpa, Oklahoma,
the other day, and a gal named -- a real good friend of mine 
who came -- her name is Beverly LaHaye(?) -- she said, "You 
know, government has deprived me of my opportunity to be 
charitable."  That is what we are going to change in this 
country.

<p>

I am very excited about what is happening here.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Senator, we so appreciate your 
taking the time to be with us.

<p>

Marty, you have been working on welfare policy.
Do you think that a change will allow people the chance to 
be more charitable?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, I think so, and I think 
that Senator Coates earlier really touched upon it, that 
that is what we should be looking towards, is to give people 
at the local level the opportunity to do more within their 
own communities, and that is the type of charitable help 
that will really make a difference in people's lives, 
because it is much closer to home, and they know exactly 
where it came from, not from a faceless bureaucrat in 
Washington.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Do you see any connection, 
Ambassador Keyes, in the welfare state, where we are kind of 
dehumanizing people in a way, and the abortion mentality?  
Has there been a seepage over of our philosophy, kind of 
downgrading people?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, I think that both of them 
come, ultimately, from a failure to recognize that what 
defines human beings is their moral capacity, and I think 
that denying that moral capacity means that you set up 
programs that treat human beings as if they are ripe for 
dependency, have no initiative, can take no responsibility, 
and will not be accountable for their own lives and actions.

<p>

And so you hand them a handout, you don't ask that 
in exchange they show some respect and work and try to build 
up their lives, which, of course, is what is done at the 
charitable level by churches and by community groups where 
people work one to one and really have to deal with one 
another as human beings, showing respect for that moral 
capacity and that sense of responsibility.

<p>

And, of course, abortion rests on that same utter 
denial that we must be responsible for the consequences of 
our actions and that same radical selfishness which looks to 
someone else to bear the burden for your condition and 
situation.

<p>

In the case of the welfare state, it is some 
faceless taxpayer through some faceless bureaucrat from whom 
you get support, and in the case of abortion, it's the 
innocent life of that child that is going to be taken rather 
than having you take on the responsibility you should.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Tough issues.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: But the spirit is the same in both cases.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I would like to thank you so much, 
Ambassador, and so much, Marty.  We look forward to having 
both of you on <i>Straight Talk</i> again. I know our viewers 
will, too.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.  We 
have been coming to you live from San Diego.  Some things 
you saw on television; some things we showed you -- 
convention highlights when the Republicans were here in 
California.  The Democrats are in Chicago right now, but 
there are still more highlights, some more things that you 
didn't get to see on the networks or on some of your 
favorite programs.  So please stay tuned for more convention 
highlights from San Diego while we talk to you about what's 
going on Behind the Headlines. 

<p>

</center>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gary, thank you so much for taking
time out of your busy convention schedule to meet with us.

<p>

You have been here now for almost two weeks.  You 
came for the platform committee, and now we are in the 
middle of the convention.  As you evaluate the last two 
weeks, how would you describe what has happened?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, Kristi, first of all, it has 
been extraordinary to run into just literally hundreds of 
delegates that are at a Republican convention or any 
convention for the first time in their lives.  I have run 
into teachers and home-schoolers and just typical mothers 
and professional people that, over the last couple of years, 
have gotten into politics because they care about family 
issues or the sanctity-of-human-life issue.  And now here 
they are at a major party convention representing their 
states.  So that has been really exciting. 

<p>

The other thing is that these folks have 
accomplished some things here.  They have a good, 
conservative platform, because so many of them were elected 
as delegates.  I think they have had an indirect influence 
on Bob Dole's choice of a running mate.  I think the Dole 
campaign knew that they had to go with a running mate who 
was a solid conservative and also had a pro-life voting 
record. 

<p>

So I am impressed, and I think the delegates here 
ought to feel pretty good about themselves. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Again, in fact, the delegates really 
-- that story is one that confirms some things that you have 
said all along.  About 50 to 60 percent of the delegates 
describe themselves as being pro-family, pro-life 
conservatives.  Do you think that that reflects the kind of 
energy that you have seen nationwide? 

<p>

MR. BAUER: No question about it.  The real growth 
in the Republican Party all around the country is coming 
from pro-family and pro-life activists.  I mean, the 
economic issues are extremely important to the Republican 
Party, and the economic issues are also family issues in the 
sense that American families are working harder and harder 
and they are falling further and further behind on the 
treadmill.

<p>

But when you really go out around the grass roots, 
it is not so much the economic issues as it is the sense 
that there is something that has gone wrong with the 
culture, that the family has broken down -- the 1.5 million 
abortions a year that we have.  That is what is generating 
all this energy and excitement and growth in the Republican 
Party, and I hope the people at the top of the Republican 
Party understand that that is where all the new blood in the 
party is coming from. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: But if you think about where we have 
come on Vice Presidential selections; I mean, rumors of 
Colin Powell and Christine Todd Whitman, and now Jack Kemp 
is the selection --

<p>

MR. BAUER: Right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  -- what do you think was the impact 
that a lot of these pro-family Americans had on that 
pendulum swing? 

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, I actually heard through the 
grapevine that the Dole campaign did some polling of 
delegations before they got to San Diego and discovered that 
they would have a major problem on their hands at this 
convention if they had gone with a pro-abortion running mate.

<p>

So you are right; we went from a point six or 
eight weeks ago where literally almost every name on the 
list was pro-abortion and from the more liberal wing of the 
party to the point where, I think, over the last 10 days, 
even before the Kemp selection, almost every name was pro-
life and pro-family.  Whether it was Senator Nickles or 
Senator Mack of Florida, Governor Engler, or Jack Kemp, the 
ultimate choice, every trend line within the Republican 
Party is in a pro-life, pro-family direction. 

<p>

We saw it again just recently in the three Senate 
primaries in Georgia, Kansas, and Michigan.  I think we are 
going to see it this November in races all over the country.  
We saw it two years ago in the congressional races, where 
every pro-life incumbent won and no pro-life challenger lost.

<p>

So I think the trend line is pretty clear.  I am 
glad that Christine Todd Whitman and Colin Powell and 
Governor Wilson find other parts of the Republican agenda 
compelling enough that they want to be Republicans, but I 
think they are going to have to content themselves to be in 
a party that is pro-family and pro-life. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to see throughout the 
show, Gary, some of the scenes from San Diego.  But what do 
you think the untold story is that our viewers may not know 
about what has been happening here in the last two weeks? 

<p>

MR. BAUER: I think the untold story at this 
convention is the one that we have already talked about.  
There is a lot of cynicism in the media about people being 
turned off on politics, that nobody trusts the system 
anymore, and yet here there are literally several thousand 
people, most of whom are new to politics, just getting 
involved at the grassroots level. 

<p>

Time and time again, they came up to me and said, 
"I'm just starting.  This isn't a one shot for me.  I'm 
going to be in this four years from now and eight years from 
now."  That's exciting.  That's good for American democracy 
and good for America and good for the Republican Party. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gary, as we have gone from place to 
place throughout the convention and the platform hearing, we 
have seen crowds form, instantaneous news conferences, a 
tremendous outpouring of public support.  We are going to 
show some of that throughout the show. 

<p>

One reporter called it Christian Woodstock, 
watching the kind of reaction of people to you as you have 
come here to the platform.  What is your response to this 
incredible outpouring of really affection and interest in 
what you're doing? 

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, it's humbling, actually.  I 
mean, I am flattered by it and pleased by it.  But whatever 
I do in Washington, I am able to do only because I have the 
proxy of all these folks that have been coming up to us this 
week.  And so my hat goes off to them rather than them 
thinking that I am the important person in this movement.  
They are the important people, and I am just trying to speak 
for them.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gary, take a look at the next four 
years and the next eight years.  Where is the balance of 
power going to lie between the economics and the social 
issues, and how will they work together? 

<p>

MR. BAUER: I think that a Republican Party that 
will be at its peak effectiveness will be a Republican Party 
where the economic issues and the social issues are seen as 
being equal -- equal of attention, equal of energy, et 
cetera.  And when the Republican Party really finds its 
voice, not only on the need for economic reform and lower 
taxes but also on the issues of cultural renewal and the 
respect for life, then I think it's going to be an extremely 
difficult party for anyone to overcome and anybody to 
dislodge as the majority party in the United States.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to San Diego, 
California, where we are bringing you more pro-family 
highlights from the convention.  Let's take a look. 

<p>

[Clips from convention and related events follow:]

<p>

CONVENTION ATTENDEE:  Well, I think the families 
of America have a great ticket, they have a great platform, 
and now they've got a great party.  It's called the 
Republican Party. 

<p>

[Segment from Tribute to Patrick J. Buchanan,
Escondido, California, August 11, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MR. BUCHANAN: Friends, what are we doing to our 
own people?  During this campaign, I went down to a tiny
town in Louisiana, central Louisiana in the bayou country.
It is called Rayne, Louisiana.  I went there because I had
just heard that a Fruit of the Loom plant was shutting down.
The plant had been built in 1992.  And so I went outside 
that plant where 600 women worked, and they were bewildered, 
and some of them were crying, and they didn't know what 
happened, because the plant was brand new, and they were 
making $6 an hour, and they were told that the plant was 
being shut down and one just like it was opening up in 
Mexico.

<p>

So, you know, in Washington, the think-tank 
scholars, foundation-fed, will get up and tell you, "These 
are sunset industries, these are dead-end jobs.  Let them 
all go."  But to those women of Rayne, Louisiana, those $6-
an-hour jobs were how they were raising their kids.  They 
were the best jobs they ever had, and they are not going to 
be making computers when they lose those jobs; they're going 
to be on welfare and they're going to be on unemployment. 

<p>

Across America, company towns are becoming ghost 
towns.  Behind this surface prosperity, families are being 
uprooted, forced to move out to find new work.  Young women 
who want to stay at home with their preschool children are 
being forced into the labor market to make the money to keep 
up the family's standard of living. 

<p>

You know, I am a conservative.  I have been a 
conservative all my life.  But if preserving and protecting 
neighborhoods, families, and communities, if conservatives 
aren't doing that, what is it we conservatives are trying to 
conserve? 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

Friends, either we Americans go forward together 
or we are not going forward at all.  The American people are 
crying for deliverance.  Let us join forces with men and 
women of all parties to clean up our politics.  Let's put an 
end to all corporate contributions to political parties and 
all PAC payoffs that have put America the beautiful on an 
auction block and corrupted the democratic politics of the 
greatest republic on Earth.  Let us put an end to it all, my 
friends. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

We need a party that not only preaches but 
practices a conservatism of the heart, that looks out for 
all of our people, but especially for those who have no one 
else to look out for them and no one else to speak out for 
them. 

<p>

Friends, we are in the process; the job is not 
done of making the Republican Party that kind of party 
again.  When no one else dared, back in 1991, we walked off 
a little TV show and challenged the President of the United 
States.  Look how far we have come. 

<p>

Read that party platform of 1996.  Whole sections 
that stand for life, protecting our borders, immigration 
reform, economic patriotism, fair trade, equal justice under 
law, restoring America's lost sovereignty, and putting 
America first.  They are right out of the speeches of Pat 
Buchanan, speeches we have been giving for 18 months. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

I know and I have heard the sentiments in this 
hall tonight, and I respect them, and I appreciate them. I
think I know they are born of love for our cause and 
affection and love for me and Shelly.

<p>

But, you know, the other night -- I have been 
thinking and praying over this, and something came to me 
from the grammar school history books of my childhood.  In 
the Middle Ages, there was something they called the Truce 
of God.  During the 40 days of Lent, the warring nobles and 
knights of the kings, they suspended their battles with one 
another, and there was no fighting during Lent.

<p>

I believe that today this disputaceous and, yes, 
divided party of ours needs such a truce, a temporary truce, 
a truce of San Diego.  Let us, at least for the next 10 
weeks, nobles and knights and even peasants with pitchforks, 
suspend our battles with one another and join together in a 
common cause to defeat Bill Clinton and Prince Albert.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to San Diego, 
California, where we are bringing you more pro-family 
highlights from the convention. 

<p>

[Segments from the convention follow:]

<p>

CONVENTION ATTENDEE:  We are really impressed.
We, of course, are very excited by the announcement that 
Jack Kemp will be on the ticket, and we think, frankly, it 
has been a shot in the arm that the Republicans have needed, 
and we're looking forward to great things as a result. 

<p>

CONVENTION ATTENDEE:  The party now has a platform 
[unintelligible] for open opportunity, low taxes, higher 
economic growth, higher standard of living. 

<p>

CONVENTION ATTENDEE:  Well, I'm excited about the 
prospects coming up in November.  I think we're going to do 
very well in the House and the Senate, and I think that 
there's now -- people are very optimistic about our chances 
of winning the White House as well. 

<p>

[Segment from Pro-Family Briefing, August 12, 1996, follows:]

<p>

AMBASSADOR ALAN KEYES: We have, I believe, to 
stand before the American people in order to represent what 
we believe to be true about the heart of this nation's 
identity.  There are issues that go to that heart, and we 
must speak to them with integrity, and we must understand 
the priorities implied by that integrity, or two things will 
be true:  first, we will not win; and second, we will not 
deserve to win.

<p>

And I know that's hard for folks to understand 
right now, because in the midst of all of the things that we 
do with victory in mind, we sometimes forget that victory is 
not our purpose.  It is the result of serving our purpose 
well.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

When I fought against the Communists during the 
course of the 1980s in the Reagan years, it was my 
understanding that one of the reasons we fought them was 
that they were people who believed that the end justified 
the means; that it did not matter what moral principles you 
violated so long as, in the end, your partisan cause, 
whether in a country or in the world, was triumphant. 

<p>

This cannot be the Republican way.  It cannot be 
the American way, or the battle we fought in the 1980s will 
be meaningless. 

<p>

Now, why have I said all of that?  I say all of it 
because it is true.  I, along with others, want and have 
worked very hard to make sure that the appeal of the 
Republican Party would be as broad as possible in terms of 
the kind of formal groupings that the media and others try 
to impose on us:  Are we going to attract enough Hispanics 
and enough blacks and enough women and enough other 
divisions to our division to make it the majority division? 

<p>

This is important, except that those groupings are 
all wrong.  In the end, human beings are not fundamentally 
divided on the basis of these superficial differences.  We 
are fundamentally divided, most importantly of all, on the 
ground of what we think is right and what we think is wrong.  
That is the true division. 

<p>

And that determines, or ought to determine, our 
priority as individuals and as a party.  If it does not, 
then our ambition has corrupted our purpose, and even if 
that ambition succeeds, the corruption will fail. 

<p>

I think that is very important here in this room.  
I presume you're here because of your commitment to the 
necessity of addressing the issues that affect our moral 
character and moral life. 

<p>

We are being told these days that that is one 
special-interest group among many.  But I don't believe it 
is, because these issues are the heart of the matter.  When 
the nation was founded, it was founded on the basis of moral 
principle. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

When we went forward in the face of the wars and 
the adversities, starting with the Revolutionary War, what 
inspired and encouraged our people was that commitment to 
moral principle, that sense that as a nation we not only 
stood for something that would be successful -- see, this is 
what everyone wanted us to believe is the optimistic view of 
the American future:  We are optimistic because we're going 
to achieve success. 

<p>

But in the end, success is an empty word unless we 
know the standard by which that success is to be measured, 
and I think that success for America has to mean what it 
meant in the beginning, that we hold these truths to be 
self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are 
endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, 
and that that phrase is not just a statement of abstract 
principle; it is the definition of liberty.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And if we abandon that definition, then in the end 
our success will be no success at all. 

<p>

And the cause that brings us together, the cause 
of the family, the cause of our defense of life, these look 
like discrete causes(?), but they're not.  In the end, there 
is only one principle at work here:  either we accept that 
first definition of our liberty, which sees it as a gift 
from the hand of God dependent on our respect for His 
authority, His will, His standards, His law, or we do not. 

<p>

And I think that for all the polls -- I see polls.
This morning I was reading a poll about abortion, and the 
footnote in the USA Today thing was, you know, the vote 5 to 
4 in the Casey(?) decision seems to have achieved what all 
of these parties cannot.  It has gotten to the position 
where the majority of the American people are, according to 
our poll, and that is a position that is a little bit this 
way and a little bit that way about abortion, doesn't treat 
it as an issue of principle.

<p>

But haven't we in our history learned that there 
are certain issues that do not depend on majority vote, that 
there are certain issues that cannot depend on majority 
rule?  And was it not the wisdom of the founder of the 
Republican Party that there are times in history when you 
must stand for those principles regardless of what may seem 
to be the majority opinion, because the purpose of 
leadership is not merely to be the puppet of every majority 
whim; it is, rather, to be the representatives of those 
principles by virtue of which the majority assumes the right 
to rule, by virtue of which every individual assumes the 
right to demand respect for their vote and for their consent.

<p>

And the principles that we champion and defend in 
the cause of the unborn are not only the principles of 
respect for innocent life in every particular case; they are 
the principles of respect for that truth that the source of 
human rights is not a human decision.  It is not the 
mother's choice; it is not the Constitution's words; it is 
not the Supreme Court's decision.  The source of human 
rights is a will beyond our will, a choice beyond our 
choice, and we must respect that or lose all sense of right.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

Everything else we do, by the way, flows from 
that.  That includes our economic agenda.  When people stand 
in front of us as they sometimes try to do and they say, 
"Well, you've got fiscal conservatives and moral 
conservatives; they're at odds with each other."  Not in 
principle, because if I believe that by respecting So-and-So's 
right to control his $100,000, I am going to have to 
conclude that they have the right to own slaves and build 
death camps, is that understanding of individual rights 
accepted? 

<p>

See, we are not a party that believes in the 
untrammeled promotion of selfish interests.  We are 
committed to respect for individual rights because we 
believe in the capacity of human beings for moral choice and 
moral responsibility. 

<p>

And, therefore, we must be committed to doing 
those things and sustaining those things that build up that 
capacity for moral responsibility.  An educational system 
that understands that the ground of decent education is 
motivated and grounded in morality, and an economic system 
that understands that the ground of risk-taking and 
initiative and all of the things that are needed to sustain 
the free enterprise system we are dedicated to is a moral 
character capable of self-discipline and self-control and an 
individual will that acknowledges that there are limits to 
individual choice that come first in our responsibilities 
toward our children, toward our spouse, toward our 
community. 

<p>

This, I know, is what we all profess to believe.  
I hear it all the time.  During the course of my little 
campaign, even now as I walk the halls of this convention, 
everyone acknowledges this is what we believe. 

<p>

You will not hear this articulated from the podium 
at this convention, because the connection between our 
economic hopes and our moral identity is being denied here.  
But it is the truth of our Republican creed.  And regardless 
of what the consequences are for the moment, those who truly 
believe in that creed will have to stand for it, come what 
may. 

<p>

I am put in mind of the fact that Ronald Reagan 
spent 20 years in the American political wilderness 
championing what was right before, in the 1980 election, he 
finally was able to achieve success.  He stored up all that 
integrity so that, at a moment of our great international 
crisis, it would be there in reserve. 

<p>

Some of us still have to store up the integrity of 
this nation's truth, and in the moment of our real crisis, 
which is coming, which has come, it will be there in reserve.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  More pro-family highlights from the 
GOP convention in just a moment.  Please stay tuned. 

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to a look at more pro-family 
highlights from San Diego, California, and <i>Straight 
Talk from the Family Research Council</i>.

<p>

[Segment from Republican National Coalition for 
Life's "A Whale of a Party," August 13, 1996, follows:] 

<p>

MR. BAUER:  For millions of Americans, life is not 
about judicial decisions and executive decrees in 
Washington.  It's helping hands and good neighbors.  It's 
nighttime prayers and lovingly packed lunch boxes.  It's 
hard work and a little put away for the future. 

<p>

Those are the things you believed in.  Those are 
the things the American people, even in 1996, believe in.
Fight for those things.  Teach your children about those
things.  And if you do that, we will have this meeting again 
on the floor of the Republican convention in the year 2000. 

<p>

God bless you all.  Thank you.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MRS. BEVERLY LA HAYE:  You know, we're really the 
pro-life world right here.  You are the men and women of 
America that really count and will make a difference.  We 
dare not let our voice be silent; we must speak out. 

<p>

PARTICIPANT: -- three leaders who have brought 
the pro-life cause to the national audience through the 
Presidential debates. 

<p>

MR. BUCHANAN:  The platform of the Republican 
Party reflects the views and values of right to life all the 
way, and that's our victory.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES:  I believe that it is essential, 
given the evil that we fight, that we come together and 
unite, dwelling not so much upon our failings, our foibles, 
our inadequacies, as upon the fact that however hard the 
journey was, however great the temptations may have been, 
the Republican Party at this convention has reached the 
right conclusion, we have made the right choices, and we go 
forward now to represent once again the right alternatives 
for this great nation. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE DORNAN:  All of you remember 
Clinton, on the disgraceful day, 20th anniversary of Roe v. 
Wade, Phyllis and I and some of you and Gary Bauer were all 
out on the Ellipse.  He looks through the window at us and 
signs five executive orders, death orders, what Billy Graham 
and the Pope and Mother Teresa called the culture of death, 
five executive death orders:  RU 486, human pesticide; what 
Chris fights on, the Chiro(?) policy crushing the Mexico 
City policy.  It went on and on.

<p>

One has been reversed; four to go.  The one that 
is reversed, with your help, with Chris speaking on the 
floor with me, and Henry, no abortions in military 
hospitals. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

I won it last year.  I held the line this year.
One down, four to go.  God bless you.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE DORNAN: Here we are.  That's 
pretty good.  Hey, William, look up here, buddy.  Come on,
Molly, look around here.  There we are.  Here's all my gang.
This is why I'm for life.  Any questions?  There it is. 

<p>

[Segment from Christian Coalition's Faith and 
Freedom Celebration, August 14, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MR. RALPH REED:  We are to proclaim loud and clear 
that this country was made great not by taxing and spending 
bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., but by faith in God and the 
traditional family. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And in case you haven't heard it from the podium 
the last two days, let me say it so that there can be no 
doubt:  the Republican Party is a pro-life party, and as 
long as we're here, it always will be. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

We are inclusive.  We are open.  We exclude no 
one.  But lest there be any doubt, we will never walk away 
from the innocent sanctity of human life in the mother's womb.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

I have in my hand your 1996 Republican platform.  
There have been some this week that have said they haven't 
read the platform yet.  I don't intend on reading the whole 
thing this morning, but let me just go through a few of the 
things that are in here that this ticket and this party 
stand for. 

<p>

First of all, this platform calls for a human life 
amendment to protect all innocent human life:  born, aged, 
disabled, infirm, and elderly.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

It calls for a constitutional amendment to ensure 
that every single child in America has the same right that 
every member of Congress and every member of the Supreme 
Court has, and that is to be able to bow their head and 
begin their day with prayer in the public schools. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

It calls for a massive, $500-per-child tax cut, 
the largest tax cut in history directed at the family, to 
strengthen the most successful department of health, 
education, and welfare ever conceived, and that's the two-parent, 
intact family. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

It calls for returning control of education to 
parents and families, where it belongs, and abolishing 
outcome-based education, Goals 2000, and the Department of 
Education. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And it calls for not one more dime to go to 
Planned Parenthood to use our tax dollars to take the lives 
of unborn children. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

You know, to those who say that religious 
conservatives are an albatross hanging around the neck of 
the Republican Party, let me remind them of something.  This 
party was founded not simply to balance the budget, not 
simply to cut taxes.  It is not just a party of accountants.
This party, unique among all political parties in the 
history of Western civilization, was founded to right a 
wrong, to combat an evil, and to remove the stain of the sin 
of slavery from this land.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And just as it once stood for those who had been 
left behind who were of a different color and a different 
ethnic background, today it must stand for other 
marginalized people:  it must stand for the unborn; it must 
stand for the minority adolescent in the inner city who is 
walking through a metal detector into a school that is a war 
zone.  We must be a voice for the voiceless and a defender 
for the defenseless.  That's our mission. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  More pro-family highlights coming up 
in just a moment.  Please keep watching. 

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[Segment from U.S. Taxpayers Party National 
Convention Platform Hearing, August 15, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I want to start by just reading some 
copy that the Family Research Council had in an ad that we 
ran in the <i>Washington Post</i> about the Defense of Marriage 
Act.

<p>

As you know, in Hawaii, the Hawaii court could 
rule that a marriage of two men or two women is a marriage, 
and we have been very aggressive in fighting this.  This is 
the way that we began our conversation on the issue: 

<p>

"The institution of marriage was built to last.
It was made in heaven, recognized by the state, sanctioned 
by faith, and honored by the community.  It has gone hand in 
hand with the rise of civilization.  Marriage has survived 
Marxism, outlasted free love, outlived Woodstock, toughed 
out the Playboy philosophy, and even endured radical 
feminism." 

<p>

As one of six children from a large and boisterous 
extended family, I understand that family is more than a 
word.  You know, it's joyful; it's a great experience.  But 
it is concrete. 

<p>

Family is that unit which is bound by marriage, by 
blood, by birth, and by adoption.  It is not a fill-in-the-blank 
phenomenon.  It is not something that we define based 
on the way that we feel today and not tomorrow.  It is a 
firm foundation for raising the next generation, and it is 
specific, concrete, and has long-lasting benefits. 

<p>

The reason why our government recognizes family is 
not because the founding fathers were a well-organized 
interest group and were very effective in institutionalizing 
their world view until, thank God, you know, the homosexuals 
of log cabin came along to enlighten us, and I say that 
facetiously, of course. 

<p>

Family has created the world in which we all 
survive.  In the same way in which water is a bond of 
hydrogen and oxygen, and it creates something that has a 
unique and specific life-giving value to everyone, marriage 
is the union of a man and a woman.  And if we call every 
fluid water, that does not mean that everything you drink is 
going to have the same benefit.  And if we call every 
relationship marriage, we do not create the same foundation 
for our children, and we can bring the same poison into our 
society by pretending that all things are created equal if 
we pretend that they are.  Marriage is specific. 

<p>

That is one of the things that we're fighting and 
one of the things that we have to actually worry about 
today.  I marvel at the fact that in my 10 years in 
Washington, we go from talking about whether or not we 
should do more for the family to whether we even know what 
family is at all, and that we actually have to fight this.  
It's a chilling circumstance today. 

<p>

The Family Research Council was created to be a 
voice for the family at the federal level, and I presented 
to the Taxpayers Committee a whole family catalog of 25 
platform positions.  But I just want to kind of go through 
some touch points on things that we consider critically 
important at the Family Research Council. 

<p>

The American family is in crisis, and government 
cannot solve all the crises of the family.  But it can take 
positive steps to restore the integrity of the family and 
its vitality.  We can oppose the marriage penalty in which 
it is more financially profitable for us to live together 
rather than to marry, and under the Clinton Administration, 
that marriage penalty has increased. 

<p>

It is an overtaxed family that we are seeing 
today, and we have commended the 104th Congress for 
supporting a $500-per-child tax credit.  In fact, if the tax 
credit per child had kept pace with inflation, rather than 
the $2,500 that you have today, it would be about $9,200.  
And, ironically, when Bill Clinton was a governor, he was 
part of a national family coalition that said, Gee, we need 
a $1,000 tax credit; and the $500 one is still hard-fought 
and not yet won. 

<p>

Forty years ago, the average American family spent 
one in 50 dollars in taxes.  Today it is one in four.  And 
the second earner in a family, normally it covers about 30 
percent of the overall budget, which is exactly the kind of 
income that Uncle Sam is taking home.  We have a nation 
today in which one member of the family works for the 
government and one member of the family works to support the 
family.  And that's pathetic.  That's absolutely pathetic. 

<p>

We are not talking about women who say that they 
want to work or women who have -- I am sure we all remember 
that the Proverbs 31 woman had a thriving real estate 
business and was managing to trade with the merchant ships.  
You know, it is not a matter of saying we think that women 
should not be involved in their community.  What we are 
saying is that, statistically speaking, the vast majority of 
women would prefer to stay home when their children are 
young and cannot afford it because Uncle Sam has a voracious 
appetite for their funds, and we need to cut him off.  He 
needs to get a job. 

<p>

[Laughter and applause.]

<p>

One of the places that we can turn to on that 
front is welfare.  We believe that the failure to form 
stable families is at the heart of the welfare crisis, and 
we have in fact instituted a system which pays you not to 
name the father of your child, not to marry the father of 
your child, not to save any money, and not to work.  And if 
you manage to do these four things, yes, there's a raise in 
it for you.  And if you have another child, more money is on 
the way. 

<p>

We have created a series of disincentives that is 
destroying people, and I know that is not news to you.  The 
Family Research Council, among the policy that is supported, 
has been in favor of the family cap, and a lot of people 
have talked about this as a cruel thing.  But let us be 
honest.  We have created an incentive for you not to marry 
and for you to have more children as the best way to ensure 
that you see a raise in your income. 

<p>

My husband and I, as we contemplate our own 
family, know full well that, much as Family Research 
Council, I am sure, loves me, I don't think Gary is going to 
give me a raise every time I have a new child. 

<p>

Every family has to make its own decisions, and 
that is the strengthening process of family, people working 
together to survive, and we have destroyed families by 
pretending like certain of us are so inept or so incapable 
or must be spoken down to in such a way that we will believe 
little of them but that they bear more children, that they 
have no self-control and no capability, when in fact they 
are very intelligent people.  They are making the only 
decision available to them in which their income is 
automatically guaranteed to go up. 

<p>

And so we see that welfare reform is key.  But the 
most important kind of welfare reform is that which gets the 
community involved with people. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

We have to make our programs community-centered, 
church-centered, private initiative-centered.  We have to 
provide tax credits for those kinds of programs.  We can't 
be afraid to acknowledge that the most successful drug 
treatment programs are faith-based, that the most successful 
child care programs are faith-based, that the most 
successful alcohol programs are faith-based, that the best 
way to deal with out-of-wedlock pregnancy is faith-based. 

<p>

And instead, once again, we have a tremendous 
disincentive in our tax structure.  We're not going to help 
the people that are doing the job.  And you may have seen it 
in Texas.  There has been a lot of controversy over a drug 
program that actually works and got some money, some federal 
monies, and a very secular humanist set of lawyers went 
after them to take that money away because they actually 
mention God.  They actually mention God in the treatment of 
drug abuse. 

<p>

So, apparently, it's all right for us to have 
recidivism that leaves people dying in the streets, and it's 
not okay for us to get the community engaged in ways that we 
know will work. 

<p>

Welfare spending has increased from $57.6 billion 
in 1960 to $400 billion today.  We have gone during that 
period from 5.3 percent in out-of-wedlock births to 30.1 
percent in out-of-wedlock births.  We have gone from 22 
percent among African-Americans to 68.1 percent. 

<p>

You know, I believe frankly, I don't think we are 
hard-hearted, green-eyeshade people here -- I mean, I don't 
think anybody would have problems with a welfare state that 
was successful.  This is not a monetary discussion.  This is 
about true compassion.  And we are ruining people's lives 
with our federal dollars because we refuse to do the things 
that help them. 

<p>

We are not experimenting with "wedfare," in which 
we help people establish homes.  We are not allowing the 
church to get involved in matters of broken lives.  And 
isn't that what the church is for? 

<p>

Our goal has to be effective compassion and to get 
Uncle Sam out of the job as being the gluttonous middle-man.
On the critical moral issues of our day, we have got to have
the church involved in helping to solve our problems. 

<p>

But let us be clear that all of these programs and 
all of the tax benefits that we could think of are 
meaningless if we do not have life itself.  We hold these 
truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal 
and that they are endowed by their Creator with certain 
unalienable rights, and among those are life. 

<p>

We have got to appreciate the fact that we as a 
nation are funding, to the tune of some $245 million, the 
efforts of Planned Parenthood.  We are funding in the 
millions of dollars the U.N. conferences on the woman and on 
the child.  And we are spending millions and millions of 
dollars on condom handouts. 

<p>

I found it very ironic that my Federal Government 
made dancing condom ads.  I mean, at the very least, if 
you're going to allow such tasteless things to take place, 
can't they make them themselves?  Why am I forced to make 
these kinds of ridiculous and immoral ads and then pay for 
the air time to run them?  We are funding immorality. 

<p>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to a special live edition of 
<i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. I'm your 
host, Kristi Hamrick.  Tonight, we will bring you election 
analysis from a family perspective.  What does this split 
decision between the White House and Congress mean about the 
policies that will affect your family?

<p>

We've got some special guests to answer that 
question, but none more important than you, and we'll be 
taking your calls throughout the show.

<p>

With me tonight is former Presidential candidate 
Ambassador Keyes, who is founder and chairman of the board 
of the Declaration Foundation.  He is a syndicated columnist 
and host of his own nationally syndicated radio show, 
<i>America's Wakeup Call</i>.

<p>

Also with us is Marjorie Dannenfelser, the 
president of the Susan B. Anthony List, which is a 
nonpartisan, pro-life political action committee founded to 
help elect pro-life women to public office.

<p>

And another member of the Dannenfelser family 
joins us, her husband Marty, who leads the Family Research 
Council's Government Relations Department.  He heads the 
pro-life fight on Capitol Hill.

<p>

Welcome, each of you, to the show.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I appreciate your joining with us, 
and we will look forward to hearing what our viewers have to 
say to you.

<p>

Ambassador, let's start with you.  As you evaluate 
what just happened in the election -- Bill Clinton has 
returned, the Republicans have the House and Senate -- what 
do you think the take-home message is of the 1996 election?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I think it is pretty clear.
Bob Dole attempted to run a campaign that was strictly based 
on economic issues against a President whose great 
vulnerabilities were on the moral front. It was an insane 
strategy.  I said so for months.

<p>

In the last three weeks, four weeks, he tried to 
shift and talk more about what they called the character 
issues, but it was out of context.  He hadn't addressed the 
moral crisis that this country faces, and so, stupidly, 
pollsters were able to ask people, "Which do you think is 
more important, the issues or character?" when in point of 
fact character is an element of all the important issues, 
and that distinction showed that the homework hadn't been 
done.

<p>

The relationship between America's crisis in the 
family, in the schools, on the streets, the crisis of crime, 
even in the area of health care, you can see the impact of 
behavior that is resulting from the moral breakdown in the 
society.  Every one of these issues is in fact a reflection 
of the moral crisis, and to make a separation between the 
issue of character, the moral issues, and the tremendous 
issues that we face as a people, particularly as they affect 
our family and our kids, this is insane.  But I think it 
reflected the deficiency of the Dole camp.

<p>

On the House side, I think what we saw, however, 
was a confirmation of what began in 1994.  Essentially, the 
conservatism of America was confirmed in this election by a 
President who felt he had to run as a conservative, even if 
it meant lying all the time, and by a Congress that, in the 
end, is in the hands of an even more strongly conservative 
and strongly morally conservative Republican coalition than 
was the case before the election.

<p>

So I think, all told, the outcome of the election 
is a strong message that we had better start taking the 
moral issues seriously.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And everybody was a pro-family 
conservative.  I woke up to NPR one morning, National Public 
Radio, to hear Bill Clinton explain how the liberal, Paul 
Wellstone, is really a conservative.  I thought, boy, 
conservative values really must be playing if Paul thinks he 
has to be one.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

Marty, when you look at the Congress, do we have a 
more conservative Congress?  It would appear from the 
campaigns, anyway, that everyone is a conservative today.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, on paper, I would say 
certainly the Senate is more pro-family conservative.  You 
might look at who won and who lost in the House and see a 
narrow diminution of the strength in the House.  But you had 
a gap between the House and Senate last time, whereas the 
House was the real stronger body taking the lead on those 
issues, and some of them would get tied up in the Senate.

<p>

So I think the House is probably still 
sufficiently strong to push forward on many of these issues 
and now, hopefully, with some of the House members going 
over to the Senate, like Tim Hutchinson and Sam Brownback 
and so on, to add to that strength, they will be able to 
carry through and send more issues down to Mr. Clinton, who 
will have an opportunity to then show us what a pro-family 
conservative he is by signing some of these bills that we 
heard about on the Christian radio ads, and so on.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Tim Hutchinson has got to be a great 
story. I mean, here you've got Bill Clinton from Arkansas, 
and then you have, in his own Senate seat, he cannot put a 
Democrat in there.  We get not just a Republican but a 
conservative Republican.  We don't have a William Weld kind 
of Republican in that chair.  What do you make of that?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, you've had people like 
that getting elected ever since -- in Arkansas -- ever since 
Bill Clinton got elected President.  Mike Huckabee got 
elected lieutenant governor immediately after Bill Clinton, 
and now he is the governor.  He succeeded in the wake of a 
scandal involving the governor.  He was prepared to run for 
that Senate seat himself, but when the incumbent governor 
dropped out, he had to go fill it, and Tim Hutchinson was 
able to step into that void and fill that seat, and the 
trend in Arkansas is very much towards pro-family 
conservatives.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, Marjorie, you track the 
pro-life issue, and speaking for myself, personally, I had 
to be disappointed that the pro-life issues, they certainly 
motivate a lot of people at the grass roots, but at the 
Presidential level, there was almost a vacuum.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What do you see on the pro-life 
front in this election?

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: On the Presidential level, you 
mean, or on the congressional level?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: On any of the levels.  Where is the 
good news for us?

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Well, in several of our 
congressional races, abortion was a very high-profile issue, 
and the Susan B. Anthony List only picks candidates that are 
going to be very aggressive on the issue.  So where there 
are opportunities, our candidates were very forthright.  And 
certainly in some districts it is going to play better; in 
some districts it is just going to play not as well.

<p>

One of our best pieces of news is that Jo Ann 
Emerson, who ran for her husband's open seat in Missouri, 
beat the Emily's List candidate, whose name is Emily 
Firebaugh -- how about that?  And I understand she was.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

We really found that when our candidates used 
especially the partial-birth abortion ban issue, which no 
human being alive can be for partial-birth abortions, for 
the first time they had the courage to talk about it, a lot 
of candidates had the courage to talk about it because they 
knew that everyone was behind them, and their opponents were 
in retreat on that issue, because we focused on challenges. 
We were challenging incumbents, and all of them had voted 
against the ban.  So it worked well in those elections.

<p>

The problem was that there was a very concerted 
national effort to oust all those great Republican pro-life 
women who ran and won with our help, and they were 
successful in many cases.  So we had sort of a wash.  Picked 
up two, lost two.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I was watching CNN today and was 
very interested to hear that the pro-life issue is not 
influential anymore.  Do we agree with that?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I think there is going to be a 
lot of brainwashing garbage going on in the media right now 
in order to camouflage the truth of this election.  But I 
think that the aim of many things that happened this time 
around on the part of an establishment that included a lot 
of Republicans, meaning no offense, was to try to drive the 
moral issues, not just the pro-life issue but the moral 
issues, out of American politics.  They did not succeed.

<p>

I think there was a concerted effort to do that 
during the Republican primary season.  That failed.  I think 
that it was clear at the convention that an effort was made 
from the podium to lie about the real nature of the 
Republican Party and its issues, and that effort from the 
podium succeeded, with the result that Bob Dole never 
consolidated his base and ran one of the poorest campaigns 
we have ever seen in terms of an ability to consolidate 
support within the Republican ranks.

<p>

So I think that there was thinking that said we 
are going to use this election to get rid of the influence 
of these moral conservatives, and it simply did not work.  
And indeed, I think the election results, particularly with 
the defeat of prominent pro-abortion liberals, as I call 
them, the Colin Powell liberals, like William Weld, like 
Zimmer, I think it really put a wrench in the works of those 
people who had written their stories already about how this 
election proved that the moral issues were no good, the pro-
life issue was no good, Republicans were going to have to 
broaden their base by picking the likes of Susan Molinari 
and Christine Todd Whitman.  All of that is laughable in the 
face of the results of yesterday's election.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The Northeast was great.  I mean, 
there is Bob Smith, who struggles to a victory, and then 
you've got the Zimmers and the Welds who don't.  I mean, 
Zimmer took Christine's formula.  Marty, what did you think 
about that?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, it was interesting the 
way the networks were so quick to pronounce Bob Smith dead 
last night.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: They all projected that he was 
defeated early on in the evening -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: They had to resuscitate him.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: -- and he cast himself as Mark 
Twain today, that reports of my death have been greatly 
exaggerated.  But they all made these projections, and here 
was Bob Smith, who had been the champion of the partial-
birth abortion (ban), who had taken heat for talking about 
this on the floor of the Senate, which was not proper.  You 
know, that was not the type of thing you should do on the 
floor of the Senate, after all.  And yet they didn't, in the 
end, really get him.

<p>

And they called another state, the whole state of 
North Carolina, going the other way early in the evening, as 
well, and that came out five points in the opposite 
direction.  So it was very interesting.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I don't know if Bob Smith saw 
it, but I thought that there was a real Providential irony 
in the fact that Bob Dole wanted to be the one who could 
hold a newspaper that had printed a false headline, and to 
do that, he abandoned essentially the prominent position of 
the moral issues.  Bob Smith stuck with those issues, and he 
could have held a copy of the Washington Post that said, 
"Smith Loses."

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, he could have.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I mean, God gave him that 
victory because he had stood firm on the right issue.  I 
deeply believe this is true.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to talk more 
about this in a second.  When we return, we will open the 
phone lines so you can join the discussion with tonight's 
very special guests.  You can reach us by the phone, 1-800-
5000-NET, or by fax at 202-544-2405.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>, where we are coming to you live 
to talk about the election results.  I am joined by 
Ambassador Alan Keyes; Marty Dannenfelser, who heads the 
Family Research Council government relations operation; and 
Marjorie Dannenfelser, who is head of the pro-life PAC, the 
Susan B. Anthony List.  You can call us at 1-800-5000-NET or 
reach us by fax at 202-544-2405. Welcome back, everyone.

<p>

Marjorie, I was intrigued by a comment you made at 
the break about what we should have learned about how to 
choose our issues.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes. I was just following up 
on what Alan was talking about earlier about how candidates 
choose what they talk about in campaigns, and when they 
decide to open the newspaper and look at whatever poll data 
might happen to be out that day and choose that to talk 
about, they are destined to lose, because it never gets 
below the epidermis and you never reach the heart.

<p>

That is what happened to Bob Dole, and it happens 
to candidates around the country, too.  It is not just on 
the Presidential level.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is true.

<p>

We have our first caller on the line.  We have 
Carmen from Flagstaff, Arizona.  Carmen, do you have a 
question for our panel of guests?

<p>

FLAGSTAFF (AZ) CALLER: I have two comments.
Yesterday when I was going to vote, and I asked a lot of 
people that said, "We're not going to vote" -- people in the 
office, people everywhere -- "We're not going to vote.  You 
can buy the electoral votes, so my vote doesn't count."  
They said, "The unions already bought those votes, no matter 
how people vote, so it doesn't really matter." They 
wouldn't even think about going to vote.

<p>

The other comment is that -- I said it in 1992.  
King Solomon said it in the book of Proverbs.  "When the 
wicked are in authority, transgression increases."  So don't 
be too surprised if our moral values go all the way down, we 
see more terrorist attacks, more of everything.  That is 
what has been happening in the last four years.

<p>

But my biggest concern is the electoral vote, what 
people said yesterday.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's a really good point, Carmen. 
You know, Marty, we were looking at that this morning a 
little bit, about the fact that even though the unions put 
all that money in, and a lot of people had the same idea 
that Carmen did, that a lot of the freshmen survived despite 
$35 million or $40 million worth of onslaught.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: They did. They went out there 
and in some cases created a backlash.  They were pointing 
out that this was a lot of money coming in just to distort 
what they had really done. These were outside groups that 
really had no interest in informing their own constituents 
but rather to create this distorted image to the more 
general public, and it did create some backlash in certain 
areas.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I think there was a concerted 
effort, too, that dovetailed with what the newspapers and 
the television people were doing.  I can't help but think it 
was no accident that you had these wildly exaggerated poll 
numbers, as it turned out, and that in fact the most 
accurate pollster turns out to have been Zogby, who all 
along showed a much tighter race, going at one point to less 
than four percentage points.  And if that had been the kind 
of polling that had been characteristic, then all along it 
would have been portrayed as a tight race with Bob Dole 
fluctuating, and I think we would have seen a very different 
mentality among voters in terms of participation, interest, 
because they would not have had the sense that it was a 
forgone conclusion.

<p>

So the union money plus the media presumption 
about the outcome, I think, helped to induce apathy.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think it did, too.

<p>

Let's take another quick caller.  We have on the 
line Chuck from Ohio.  Chuck, what do you have to say?

<p>

XENIA (OH) CALLER: Good evening.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Hi!

<p>

XENIA CALLER: Thanks for taking my call.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thanks for calling.

<p>

XENIA CALLER: I am a conservative Christian. I 
am also a retired UAW member, so I was involved in unions, 
too, and I am just so glad that I am not working now or I 
would really be raising Cain, because I am one of the 40 
percent that voted Republican.

<p>

I saw Mr. Keyes on <i>Cornerstone Live</i> back in March.
Do you remember that?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Yes.

<p>

XENIA CALLER: You were on there with Elizabeth 
Dole, and it was right after your little escapade in 
Atlanta.

<p>

Well, I voted for Buchanan in the primary, but I 
wanted to make two points.  I was just wondering why 
Elizabeth Dole didn't have a little more influence with her 
husband in this partial-birth ban.  Now, I was wondering 
when it was ever going to come up.  It finally came up.  I 
followed him all over the country on satellite, on KU band, 
and he addressed it to just a couple thousand here and a 
couple thousand there.  He never really nationally exploited 
it.

<p>

The other point I would like to make is, right 
after the election last night, on CBS, Dan Rather thinks the 
Republican Party must pull together and move to the center 
and away from the religious right.  I can't see where he is 
coming from.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What is so ironic about that -- I 
want to hear what you have to say about that, Ambassador -- 
but the voting numbers were clear.  I know we have all heard 
them, that the best bloc of the GOP was the people of faith.
I mean, how could Dan Rather say that?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: This is why Rather wants us to 
move to the center, so we'll lose all the time.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

I was sitting next to, what is his name, Bob 
Fromme(?), I think, who was Torricelli's campaign 
consultant, and he was also responsible for that despicable 
commercial that featured David Duke against the civil rights 
initiative in California.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, that is right.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: And his advice to the 
Republican Party is that you had better go with the Whitmans 
and you better leave -- and I hope you'll follow Keyes' 
advice and do all of this moral stuff because then you'll 
lose.  No, it's not true.  They want us to abandon the moral 
issues because then we'll lose consistently, as Dole just 
did, and I think that is what Dan Rather and his cronies are 
up to. They would love to see Republicans behave every time 
the way Dole and Kemp behaved this time because we'll get 
creamed as they got creamed, in the debates and before the 
electorate. That is their wish, that we should do the wrong 
thing. I think if we ignore them and instead build on the 
base of strong moral conservatism, there is a majority 
there, including especially those people, some of whom sat 
out the election this time because they weren't very 
enthused --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, definitely.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: -- some of whom we still 
haven't awakened yet to move out of the pews and into the 
voting booth.  But we're going to.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: I find it interesting, every 
four years or sometimes even on the two-year cycles, the Dan 
Rathers and people like that have the same conclusions.  
They wring their hands about negative campaigns.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's right.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: They profess that the 
candidates are not talking about the issues.  But as you 
study the news, you find out that the sound bites of the 
candidates talking about the issues get shorter and shorter. 
I think they averaged about six or seven seconds in this 
most recent campaign cycle.  And then it is the same advice. 
It was the religious right again.  No matter how strong of a 
margin they got with them, they are the ones who were 
causing them this problem.  It is always the same 
conclusion.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It seems to me that Bob Dole and 
Bill Clinton ran the campaign that the media would like -- 
no issues, lots of fluff, absolutely nothing of substance --
and we had the lowest voter turnout since, what, the 1920s?

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes. About a million dollars 
of consultant fees will pay for that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Their idea of negative is very 
strange, too.  I mean, if you said anything at all, however 
true, about Clinton or about Democrats that brought out a 
lot of the negatives, which are there in the record, then 
that was negative campaigning.  But if you had a filthy 
piece like the Schrum(?) commercial, which basically used 
David Duke in order to do what, produce a 60-second slur 
that called everybody who supported the CCRI a racist, that 
is name calling, but they didn't consider that negative 
campaigning.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And they paid him to do that, too.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: That is right.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: I think it is important for 
people to realize how much is working against elected 
officials to do the wrong thing, you know, to make bad 
decisions, even when they are really well grounded in their 
faith when they arrive, they are still going back to their 
districts all the time, everything in Washington trends 
towards making the wrong decisions. The consultants, who 
just basically they worked on a congressional staff once and 
now they have the great position of telling other people 
what to do, I mean, they are not necessarily qualified to 
tell candidates how to run a good campaign. The 
consultants, the atmosphere of Capitol Hill.

<p>

Without the real active involvement of people out 
in the country, that will prevail, without, first of all, 
the faith and then the really active involvement of people 
out there.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It involves people.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will 
bring you more about the battle to protect pro-family 
issues.  Stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>, where we are coming to you live 
with Ambassador Alan Keyes; Marjorie Dannenfelser, president 
of the Susan B. Anthony List; and political expert Marty 
Dannenfelser of Family Research Council.  And we would also 
like to hear from you, so you can please call us at 1-800-5000-NET.

<p>

Ambassador, we were just talking about the fact 
that it is not so often that our issues are not advanced; 
they are not even -- you know, no one takes the time.  No 
one wants to do the fight, giving up before we even get 
started.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, I think you see a lot of 
that.  In fact, it is induced in a way by the media, and 
then it affects the minds of folks.  I thought it was a real 
disease on the Dole campaign, where they seemed very anxious 
to give up, I mean Scott Reed giving an interview to The New 
Yorker a week and a half before the campaign ended, that 
came out the day before the election, saying that, "I told 
Bob Dole every day, I put the poll numbers in front of him 
and said, 'You know, Bob, we might not win this one.'"

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I know.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: And I am thinking, what a thing 
for a campaign manager to be doing.  And the very night of 
the election, Nelson Warfield, two hours before the 
California polls closed, issued a statement praising Bob 
Dole for his courage in defeat.  And I am thinking, this is 
crazy, what is he up to?

<p>

But there was this mentality of preemptive 
surrender, and I am glad, actually, that at a personal level 
-- his staff apparently was very defeatist, but Dole went on 
fighting right to the end, and I think his willingness to 
put up a strong fight, not to back off and kind of collapse 
the way, unhappily, Bush did in 1992 was very important in 
helping Republicans to keep the Congress, because it buoyed 
up the party around the country psychologically; it helped a 
lot in California to keep things from getting out of hand 
there; and I think it helped to maintain the sort of 
firewall that prevented Clinton's victory from expanding 
into control of the Congress.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It could have saved the House and Senate.

<p>

We have a caller on the line from historic Valley 
Forge, Pennsylvania.

<p>

VALLEY FORGE (PA) CALLER: Oh, hi.  How are you?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Hi. Thanks for joining us.

<p>

VALLEY FORGE CALLER: When they wanted the Jews to 
repent, they showed the bodies, shriveled, and when they 
wanted people to send to Ethiopia, they showed the bloated 
bodies.  Why aren't Christians putting up billboards with a 
manger scene, with an empty manger, with the words, "I'm 
sorry, Joseph, we couldn't afford him"?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Good point.

<p>

Marjorie, you work on this pro-life issue.  What 
kinds of messages do you find really motivate people when 
you are working on them?

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Well, that was very touching, 
and that was a beautiful way to put it.

<p>

I find, and we have a unique stance at the Susan 
B. Anthony List among PACs.  We really require of our 
candidates that they do two things, that they project the 
justice of changing laws to protect the unborn, and they 
project the mercy and the compassion that we have to reach 
women where they are.

<p>

I mean, the reality of this issue is that women 
have abortions, and when we have women in public office who 
are talking to women on their own terms and saying that they 
have a sense for where they are -- I mean, I think it is 
very important.  It is very important to have that 
connection, and I think it is important to have women 
discussing it in those terms.

<p>

I think what resonates the most, frankly, just on 
a debate level -- I think that ad is a great idea that the 
caller called in with -- but is, what is it?  You know, 
whenever I am debating the issue, what is an abortion?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What are you choosing?

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: What is it? I mean, what is 
that "thing"?   You have to address that before you can move 
on.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Let's take one more quick caller.
We have on the line Kay from Wyoming.  Kay, do you have a 
question or a comment for our distinguished panel?

<p>

RIVERTON (WY) CALLER: I do. I have a couple 
things.  First of all, on the issues, our issues do not lend 
themselves easily to sound-bite campaigning, and until we 
break through that format that we are permitted, we are 
going to have problems getting our point across.

<p>

Dr. Keyes was pointing out about the polls, and 
you have to remember, the American press uses polls as a 
weapon, not a tool.  They try to use polls to change 
people's opinion or to frame it.  They don't use it for a 
measuring device.

<p>

My question, also, is -- the big question is, did 
the RNC learn anything this time around, and what are they 
going to foist upon us in 2000?  Are we going to have 
another left-leaning candidate and more empty issues?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, hours of conversations have 
gone into that.  I would have to say one thing, though.  I 
think that is the strength of NET as a network, to have an 
expanded conversation, and radio shows like yours.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Yes. Well, I think with 
respect to the RNC, we are just at the beginning of what is 
going to be, I believe, a very intense battle within the 
Republican Party between the grass roots, which I believe is 
overwhelmingly Reagan conservative -- pro-life, morally 
conservative, fiscally conservative, interested in 
reclaiming power from the central government and rebuilding 
the institutions of local self-government and civil society. 
I think that is the essence of the true conservatism at the 
grass roots in the Republican Party.  That is going to be 
pitted against the party elitists, the people who controlled 
the podium at the convention this time around, the people 
who had planned consistently a strategy aimed at dumping the 
moral issues, at emphasizing money above everything, and at 
trying to promote Colin Powell, Christine Whitman, others 
who basically represent the abandonment of the Republican 
Party's moral heart. We are at the beginning of that 
struggle.

<p>

I think that for the caller and for others around 
the country, what they have to realize, I think, is that in 
the next several years, we are going to have to commit 
ourselves at the grass roots to lighting fires that can be 
seen from every horizon so that nobody in the Republican 
Party structure or leadership can mistake the true sentiment 
that exists in the party at the grass roots, because it is 
going to require a lot of action; it is going to require a 
lot of persistence and perseverance on the part of people 
who are moral conservatives to keep the Republican Party 
where it belongs and to do what is necessary.  By the year 
2000, we must transform the leadership of the party.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Marty?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: On that point, I think the 
caller identifies a problem for pro-family conservatives 
that people in the major news media, the three or four major 
television networks, the newspapers on the Eastern -- you 
know, we know the newspapers, <i>New York Times</i> and others -- 
do not agree with us on these cultural issues.

<p>

But a candidate, particularly a candidate for 
President of the United States, has a unique opportunity to 
speak directly to the people.  Alan Keyes has done that, 
Ronald Reagan did that. Ronald Reagan faced a very hostile 
press.  We do hear some revisionist history from the press 
now about how nice they were to Ronald Reagan.  But those of 
us who remember the Reagan Presidency know otherwise.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's right.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Bob Dole and Jack Kemp had that 
opportunity in this campaign, and they had a moderator in 
those debates who was really a very fair-minded journalist 
who gave them some open-ended questions like, "Tell us about 
Clinton's character," or, "Tell us about the moral crisis in 
the country today," between the questioners from the 
audience in the second Presidential (debate), and they had a 
minute and a half or so to articulate these positions, and I 
don't think they did it.  They came around in circles back 
just repeating economic theory and things like that, and it 
was just absurd.

<p>

The other thing is, federal candidates can 
completely control the content of their advertising.  They 
are getting $60 million in federal funds to run a campaign. 
They can choose to do a 30-second spot, they can choose to 
do a one-minute spot, they can choose to do a five-minute, 
or Ross Perot did some half-hour spots, and they can speak 
as short or as long, within certain limits, as they want to, 
and as long as their resources will hold out, they need to 
identify the message and articulate it to the people.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And we are going to have to demand that.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: And Bob Dole obviously didn't 
do that, and he paid the price for it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's right.

<p>

We're going to have to talk more about this in a 
second.  Following this commercial break, we will continue 
our discussion about yesterday's election results and how 
they affect you.  Please stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Joining me tonight to discuss 
how yesterday's elections affect pro-family issues is 
Ambassador Alan Keyes, a steadfast leader in the pro-family 
movement, both inside and outside the beltway.  Also with us 
are Marjorie and Marty Dannenfelser.  Marjorie is the 
president of the pro-life PAC, the Susan B. Anthony List.
Marty heads Family Research Council's government relations 
efforts.  We are taking your calls at 1-800-5000-NET.

<p>

Coming back, Marty, a lot of us have been talking 
about who is going to be RNC chair.  Haley Barbour says he 
is stepping down.  Is this the kind of power struggle that 
pro-family people need to watch?  Where is the leadership 
going to come from?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, there are many different 
factions of people around the country, and people have 
formed their own coalitions.  They will look at who the 
members of the Executive Committee of the Republican 
National Committee are in the 50 states around the country 
and try to formulate a strategy for reaching them.

<p>

I think that is something; if people can have an 
influence on that process, it is probably worth doing.  But 
I don't think we should allow ourselves to become fixated on 
that, because the ultimate way that you nominate a candidate 
is at the grass-roots level, is to send delegates to the 
national convention, and it is the delegates who ultimately 
nominate the candidate -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: People who manage leadership.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: -- and then the candidate who 
sets the tone for the party and for the convention and for 
the campaign.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The Bush tone kind of was in our mouth this time.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I do think it is important, 
though, right now to try to work towards someone who is not 
going to be pushing what was, as I said, a conscious 
strategy of jettisoning the moral issues, which Haley 
Barbour was very open about.  I mean, he went around the 
country telling everybody who would listen for a while there 
that we had to get that pro-life plank out of the platform, 
we had to put these issues aside, and they were divisive, 
and all of this.

<p>

We don't need that.  What we need is someone who 
is going to articulate in a persuasive way the reasons for 
the positions that the Republican Party takes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: TO explain what we believe.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Exactly, and to do it in a way 
that will make sense to people and make them realize that 
the things we talk about are the issues.  They are not 
separate from the issues, as the media tries to imply.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Let's take a quick caller.  We have 
John on the line from the great state of Texas.  John, hi.
Do you have a comment or a question?

<p>

MIDLAND (TX) CALLER: Good evening. How are you 
doing?  I've got a quick comment, and then I've got a 
question for Alan.  I've heard all day long on the radio 
that women voted for Clinton because of abortion rights.  If 
that's true, I really feel sorry for a lot of these women.
I have Catholic friends -- I am Catholic and I even have 
Catholic friends that I know voted for Clinton, and I really 
feel sorry for them.

<p>

Alan, I was also at <i>Cornerstone</i>. I voted for you 
in the primary, and I saw you on TV last night, and you said 
something about you weren't a good speaker and you cheated.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Me?

<p>

MIDLAND CALLER: Keep on cheating, brother. We love it. We love you.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Oh, I was joking.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

MIDLAND CALLER: Where does your show originate from?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: The show originates from 
Rosslyn, Virginia.  We are on 35 stations now around the 
country and building.  So, hopefully, we will reach into 
your area sometime soon.  I hope so.

<p>

MIDLAND CALLER: Thanks a million for your show.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Can I comment for a minute, 
though, on this gender gap thing?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, the gender gap.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Before we even start to take it 
seriously.  I think it's a phony issue.  I do not believe 
there is a gender gap.  I think the gender gap is in fact a 
false symptom of something else.  And the simple fact of the 
matter, which nobody wants to really dwell on but which is 
the truth, is this:  Take Hispanic and black women out of 
the mix, and the gender gap evaporates.  It is not there.

<p>

And what does that mean?  It means you don't have 
a gender gap.  The gender gap is actually a symptom of the 
fact that we have large minority groups, Hispanics and 
blacks, who are captives of the Democratic Party; that 
amongst the white electorate, Republicans and Democrats 
compete pretty evenly still in terms of their ability to win 
the allegiance of voters; but that when you continue to get 
these lopsided majorities amongst Hispanics and blacks for 
Democrats, that produces a distorted outcome.

<p>

I think that is a very telling fact.  I am going 
to refuse to talk about this gender gap thing anymore 
because I think it is all a lie.  If one alteration makes 
the gap go away, that means that the true cause of the gap 
is not gender, it is something else, and this something else 
in this particular case is in fact racial politics, the 
politics of terrorizing minorities, which I think has been 
once again practiced in this election year by the Democrats.

<p>

But I also think it is going to change, because 
the Democrats have lost their base in the Congress which 
they used to buy off the leadership in the minority 
communities, and I think, over time, without the gravy 
train, they are going to have a very hard time continuing to 
dangle things they can't deliver in front of a coopted 
leadership, and people in the community are going to say, 
"Well, wait a minute.  We'd better start making our peace 
with these Republicans because, otherwise, we won't be part 
of the political process anymore."

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That is a fascinating analysis, 
because in <i>USA Today</i> and a Wirthlin poll I saw today all 
agree with that statement that you just made, that when you 
take minority women out, all the other things kind of break 
out evenly.

<p>

And in fact, Marty, is it not accurate that we 
have seen women more pro-life than men, generally, that 
women are more motivated for their concern for life?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: There are. There are more 
women who seem to vote on that issue, but on balance, more 
of those women vote on the pro-life side than on the other 
side.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: I don't know.  I think it is 
tremendously insulting to women to say that if you are of a 
certain gender, you are automatically going to vote -- you 
are going to have this opinion on this, this opinion.  We 
are thinking individuals that differ on all sorts of things, 
and it is more -- my vote has more to do with my core 
beliefs, what I believe in; also, my situation.  We have a 
family.  You know, things like that, not because I am a 
woman, because I am a human being.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think you are right.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: You know, the thing that I 
found striking, two things were true.  One, the lie about 
the gender gap very much influenced the thinking of the 
strategists in the Dole campaign to such an extent that they 
made foolish errors. The Susan Molinari pick was the 
stupidest thing they could have done for keynote speaker, 
except maybe for Colin Powell.  But why?  Because they 
wanted to reach out to Catholics. And what did they do? 
They put a pro-abortion Catholic on the podium who 
absolutely insulted the convictions and work of the 
Catholics who would lean toward Republicans because of their 
pro-life sentiment.  It was insane.

<p>

So Bob Dole ended up getting all the votes of pro-abortion Catholic 
women, right?  That's why he won the election.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: That's right, absolutely.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: He couldn't get those votes, 
but the votes he could have gotten, the strongly committed 
pro-life Catholics, were instead insulted by this notion 
that a pro-abortion speaker speaks for them.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: See, that is what is funny about 
that.  There was no big tent until Ronald Reagan pulled in 
pro-life Catholics and working-class Americans who felt that 
the Democratic Party was becoming liberal and insulting to 
their values.

<p>

The big tent -- I mean, you hear the Haley 
Barbours and Romsfields(?) of the world talking about it.
You would think they created it rather than they just 
benefitted from coming under the flaps.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, they didn't even 
understand it.  They are still talking as if the big tent 
has something to do with money.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: And it does not. The big tent 
had to do with the fact that the moral culture of the 
Democratic Party was hijacked by radical left-wingers who 
moved away from the traditional values of the American 
people and lost a lot of people amongst the union workers, 
amongst the ethnic groups, amongst the Catholics, who simply 
were not going to abandon their faith and their principles.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We will come back in a second.  When 
<i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will take more calls and continue 
our discussion with tonight's special guests.  Please stay 
with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to tonight's live 
edition of <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>.
I am honored to be joined by Ambassador Alan Keyes and 
Marjorie and Marty Dannenfelser, both long-term political experts.

<p>

We would also like to hear from you.  You can 
reach us at 1-800-5000-NET.

<p>

We have a caller on the line, Robert from 
Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Robert, hi.

<p>

ALBUQUERQUE (NM) CALLER: Well, good evening.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Good evening.

<p>

ALBUQUERQUE CALLER: This is the first time I have 
watched your show.  I have watched NET for a while.  But I 
like it so far.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, good. Thanks.

<p>

ALBUQUERQUE CALLER: I have two questions.  One 
you have actually partially answered.  Maybe Alan could add 
more to it.  That is, why did the Catholic vote go the way 
it did?  Two, what do you think is going to happen to the 
Republican hierarchy after actually -- I mean, it is pretty 
much common knowledge that they picked Bob Dole, they gave 
it to him, they got him through the primaries, and he lost 
the White House.

<p>

And then I have a comment, if I may.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Why don't you give us your comment 
really fast and then let's get to Alan's answers.

<p>

ALBUQUERQUE CALLER: Oh, okay.  Over the years I 
have dealt and struggled with abortion.  When it first came 
about, I went, "Yippee."  Then as I grew older and wiser, I 
realized that something was wrong here.

<p>

But the argument for abortion has always been, 
you're killing a baby, and that's true.  But I have taken on 
another tactic.  I have looked at these people who are pro-abortion, 
and I said, what gender actually benefits from 
abortion?  And the answer is men.  Men only benefit from it.

<p>

I am beginning to hear a little more about this, 
or talk this way in the media, not very much.  Do you think 
that -- or maybe my suggestion would be that you people 
would take the same course and that abortion does not 
benefit women.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is interesting.  Polling data 
indicates that single men are the biggest proponents of 
abortion, which I think there is a little self-interest 
there.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Oh, definitely.  I think they 
are very anxious to escape their responsibility toward their 
children, and so they are willing to kill the child and 
burden the woman with this awful psychological burden for 
the rest of her life that is involved in this, and we are 
not protecting.

<p>

In terms of the Catholic vote, one, I think we 
always have to remember that we are dealing with a situation 
where Catholics were overwhelmingly voting for Democrats 
until Ronald Reagan came along, and even Reagan's success 
meant that we moved from, what, 20 percent of the Catholic 
vote or less up to around 40, and even during Reagan, this 
is what we reached.  So we are not talking yet, at least, 
about getting the majority of the Catholic vote.

<p>

But I think, as I said, one mistake that was made 
in this election was that Bob Dole thought he was going to 
reach out to Catholics.  They said, "Oh, you've got to reach 
out to the Catholic vote."  And, of course, there was a 
great opportunity.  The Catholic hierarchy, for the first 
time that I can remember, actually came forward in an 
election year against a sitting Democratic President, and 
they were more Catholic than Democrat.  And for those of us 
who are Catholics, this was breathtaking, and I was so 
pleased to see it happen.

<p>

Now, what did that mean?  It meant a great 
opportunity, but to do what?  To reach out to pro-life 
Catholics and pull them in more strongly into the Republican 
cause.  And so what does Bob Dole do?  He chooses Susan 
Molinari, a pro-abortion, outspoken, rabidly pro-abortion 
Catholic, to give the keynote speech, and he thought this 
was going to help him with Catholics.  He's insane.

<p>

What it did, I think, was to take a lot of people, 
and I know, because as I went around the country speaking, I 
have found it infuriated a lot of people.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Oh, it did.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: They just felt deeply insulted 
that he simply didn't understand what was going on, who they 
were, and as a result, I think he actually may have hurt 
himself at that point and not really recovered in terms of 
the perceptions of a lot of the pro-life Catholics and I 
think, also, pro-life Christians who were not Catholic, who 
just felt like, what is this man trying to tell us?  Doesn't 
he understand who his people are?  And the answer, I think, 
was, unhappily, no, he did not, or at least his advisers 
didn't.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, I think that Bob Dole is 
fundamentally an honest and decent person, but his whole 
aura throughout this campaign seemed very calculating.  The 
debate over abortion in the Republican platform was very 
much, now we're going to have it this way, I'm going to do 
it this way, and we have to reach out to the moderate women 
and we can't offend them, so we're going to have this 
tolerance language in there.

<p>

And then he never talked about CCRI for a while 
until, all of a sudden, the last few weeks of the campaign, 
he acknowledged, yeah, we're going to talk about that 
because that's a wedge issue.  And then he didn't answer the 
question when Jim Lehrer asked him about Bill Clinton's 
character during the debate in front of 40 or 50 million 
people, and then he decided to go out on the campaign trail 
and conduct a discussion with the people in his audiences, 
"Should I get tough in the next debate?" and so on.

<p>

Just everything looked so calculating that people 
had to start wondering, well, what does this guy really 
believe in?  I think that is what came across, that every 
position he seemed to be taking was based on some political 
calculation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Rather than on what he believed.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: And it may very well be that 
Bill Clinton made his share of calculations, but at least 
when he was out on the stump, he was talking about how 
issues connect with people's personal lives.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Ironic as it may seem, I think 
some people -- and I am not saying they were right in this 
-- but they seem to prefer a sincere liar to an insincere 
honest man.  And I have to tell you that it's a dilemma, 
isn't it?

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: But don't you think that argues for 
something that I think we would be in agreement about, that 
people should stand up for something?  I think we would call 
them to stand for pro-life, pro-family values, but the 
politicals and the Dan Rathers and the Peter Jenningses say, 
"Don't stand for that much because that really offends 
people," when clearly, it draws them.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: I think the chief problem 
among candidates is just wanting to be liked.  It is a very 
basic human need.  But if you are not driven by your core 
beliefs, that just takes over.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I also think the media is very 
manipulative, because we were talking earlier about negative 
advertising.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: And the truth of the matter is, 
when you actually look at election results, challengers and 
others who are faced with tough fights, they only win when 
they are able to show people that an incumbent is not voting 
their views and values.

<p>

Now, the media calls that negative.  It is 
actually just truth-telling.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's right. It's a report card.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: If somebody has gone to 
Congress and voted in a way that betrays the values of their 
constituents -- you have liberals like a Barbara Mikulski 
pretending when they go to the Eastern Shore of Maryland 
that they are conservatives and respect family and all of 
this, meanwhile voting for everything that people there 
hate.  Well, if you want to beat somebody like that, you've 
got to tell people what she is about and what she stands 
for.  And they want to stigmatize that as negative 
advertising, and the only time -- the only time -- when that 
sort of thing is really, really bad, in their eyes, and you 
absolutely must not do it is when you are telling the truth 
about Democrats.

<p>

Now, of course, if you do the same thing and fill 
your commercials with lies, which is what the AFL-CIO did, 
they told untruths about the Republican Congress, but that 
was not characterized as negative advertising.  It's 
amazing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Isn't that funny?  Demagoguery was okay.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As long it was on Medicare.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, they were fortunate the 
Democratic members of Congress, and to a certain extent Bill 
Clinton, that they had surrogates, in a sense, doing their 
dirty work for them.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Weren't they, though?  They had the union money.

<p>

I would love to talk a little bit more.  I would 
like to thank all my guests, and we are going to have to 
have you back.

<p>

More about how you can receive information 
regarding issues affecting you and your family when <i>Straight
Talk</i> returns.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you for joining us here at 
<i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. If you 
would like to receive more information about Family Research 
Council, our guests this evening, or the topics we 
discussed, please call us at 1-800-225-4008.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
The 104th Congress should close this week, so tonight
<i>Straight Talk</i> is discussing some of the historic and 
controversial issues that caught the attention of those both 
on Capitol Hill and in homes across America.  These issues 
ranged from life to teen drug use to welfare reform to 
parental rights.

<p>

Tonight's guests worked consistently with our 
Senators and Congressman, dispensing crucial research 
information to ensure that the best arguments supporting 
pro-family viewpoints were heard.  You won't want to miss 
this key overview of your 104th Congress.

<p>

But first, we are taking you to an event which 
included some of the most prominent faith and family leaders 
in America today. They gathered in Senate majority leader 
Trent Lott's office to speak for life.  Protestant, 
Catholic, and Jewish voices blended as they urged Senators 
to override Bill Clinton's veto of the Partial-Birth 
Abortion Ban Act. This act would have protected viable 
children killed viciously moments from birth with a stab to 
the base of the skull.

<p>

The House voted to overturn President Clinton's 
veto.  After powerful debate, the Senate did not.  As you 
hear these leaders speak, you will understand why the fight 
for life is so intense and urgent.  And it's not about 
politics; it's about the kind of people we are.  Let's all 
take a look Behind the Headlines.

<p>

<center>

<p>

[Segments from the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban
Press Conference held September 26, 1996, follow:]

<p>

SENATOR TRENT LOTT: We have a great delegation of 
leaders here in this room that are going to make some 
comments on the vote that we are going to have today on 
overriding the President's veto of the Partial-Birth 
Abortion Ban.  This was a tragic mistake by the President, 
because this is a horrible, tragic procedure.

<p>

We are going to have this vote in the Senate this 
afternoon at 3:30, after continued debate this morning and 
about an hour and a half for closing debate, and then we 
will have a vote that will tell us a lot about the 
conscience of America.

<p>

This is not a regional issue.  This is not an 
issue that is affected by sex or race or by philosophy or by 
party.  This should be a vote of the heart and conscience.  
This horrible procedure is not rare, and it is murder of the 
worst kind.

<p>

We are not interested in this as a political 
issue.  We are interested in this because it is absolutely 
the right thing to do, and that is to override this veto.

<p>

So I am very pleased to be here with this 
distinguished delegation.  I want to thank them for taking 
the time to be here with us to support our effort to do the 
right thing in ending this procedure.

<p>

I want to thank especially Rick Santorum, a great 
Senator from Pennsylvania, that has taken this to heart and 
has taken it across america.  He has changed this debate.  
His efforts had an impact on the tremendous veto override 
vote in the House and are having (an impact on the) vote in 
the Senate, but more importantly, it is having an effect on 
people's minds and hearts all across America.  Thank you, 
Rick Santorum, for your work.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

SENATOR DON NICKLES: We need to recognize that we 
have laws in the land that protect endangered species, and 
if people kill the unborn of endangered species, they can be 
fined up to $50,000; they would be imprisoned for a year.  
And yet this procedure happens, and as Senator Lott 
mentioned, it is not rare.  It happens thousands of times, 
not a few times, not a couple of times.  It happens 
thousands of times across the country.

<p>

And, also, I will just mention that medical 
professionals have said it is never necessary.  President 
Clinton was wrong, maybe had wrong information, but it is 
never, never necessary for the health of the mother or to 
protect her fertility.  We have had people make that 
statement from respected professionals, C. Everett Koop and 
others, and this really is a vote about life and death.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

CARDINAL ANTHONY BEVILACQUA: This vote is 
critical for the preservation of this Nation, of our 
civilization.  As you have heard, partial-birth abortion is 
four-fifths birth and one-fifth abortion.  The child is but 
a few seconds, a few inches, away from full birth.  That 
means it is only a few seconds, a few inches, away from 
being legal infanticide.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

DR. JAMES DOBSON: You may remember in the 1980s a 
little girl named Jessica, a little toddler, fell down a 
well in Midland, Texas, and was trapped there, and a frantic 
effort to get her out began.  As I recall, for nearly 80 
hours they worked to get that little girl out.

<p>

The entire country held its breath while they 
struggled to save the life of this child, and I wept when I 
saw that child come out of that hole in the ground, and so 
did so many others.  Why?  Because of the worth of a single 
child, one child worth more than the possessions of the 
entire world in our viewpoint.

<p>

We are talking here not about one child; we are 
talking about what we now know to be thousands and thousands 
of children.

<p>

MR. CHARLES COLSON: -- and as one of the last 
survivors of Watergate, I have to tell you that I reflect 
back on that now and realize that that was a defining moment 
in the country's history because we decided as a people we 
were not going to suffer unrighteousness in high places.
And so this Nation rose up against that, and the question is 
whether, 20-some years later, we have that same moral 
indignation to rise up again against unrighteousness of the 
most horrid kind imaginable.

<p>

For me, as a Christian, I would have to say this 
with a heavy heart, but I believe if this veto is not 
overridden, that this Nation will be sanctioning 
infanticide, and a nation which sanctions infanticide is no 
better morally than China, no better morally than Nazi 
Germany was during the 1930s.

<p>

Those of us who are believing Christians, who put 
their first allegiance in the God of our fathers and Jesus 
Christ, could no longer, I believe, lend moral support to a 
government that had lost its moral legitimacy.  I think that 
issue is that serious today.

<p>

I am one who is praying for President Clinton, 
that even as he comes up here to the Capitol, his conscience 
will be stricken, he will realize that he was misinformed, 
change his opinion, and let the Nation rise up and say, 
"This is enough; we are not going to do this."

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

RABBI DANIEL LAPIN: The men and women that make 
up the body of the Jewish community understand that this 
issue has absolutely nothing to do with reproductive rights, 
but it has everything to do with the ongoing process of 
coarsening and vulgarizing American society.  This is 
something that must be stopped if we are not to descend into 
a horrifying and dark abyss.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. RICHARD LAND:  We face a situation where, in 
one operating theater, the doctors and the nurses are 
laboring heroically to save a baby's life moments from 
birth, and in the very next operating theater, they are 
laboring in some cases physically, holding the baby's head 
inside the mother's body until they can execute the child.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MS. KAY COLE JAMES: Never in my wildest dreams 
did I ever think that we would get to the point in this 
discussion, in this dialogue in America, where the extremist 
elements of the pro-choice movement would push the envelope 
so far that we are not even debating anymore whether it is 
human life; we know in fact that it is a human being.  It is 
a child.

<p>

And now we have taken this debate to the point 
that we actually have to stand here before the American 
people and plead with them that we as a Nation are not going 
to sit back and tolerate having children come down the birth 
canal and have a physician actually insert scissors in a 
very painful procedure that kills a child.

<p>

We are not talking in esoteric terms anymore, 
ladies and gentlemen.  We actually have to be here today to 
say we are talking about children, and they know it.  But 
somehow, somehow, the right to choose has been elevated over 
the right to life.

<p>

In a free and civilized society, there are some 
things about which there ought not to be a choice, and 
killing children as they come down the birth canal is one of 
them.

<p>

I feel like I am in a surreal environment that in 
America today, we have to debate that issue.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MRS. BEVERLY LA HAYE: It was Dr. James 
McMahon(?), who was one of the pioneers of the partial-birth 
abortion procedure, who said after he saw what was 
happening, before the procedure, he said, "Gee, I wish this 
baby could be adopted."

<p>

And why not? Why not let these babies live and 
then let somebody adopt them who could love them and give 
them life, rather than end their life just seconds before 
they have that opportunity?

<p>

If the President truly supports adoption, I 
challenge him to withdraw his veto and to say, "Let's adopt 
these babies and give them a chance to live."

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MS. WANDA FRANZ: One of the statements that is 
frequently made is that this procedure is only done under 
extreme cases, for cases in which the child is severely 
deformed or has a major medical problem.  However, 
Dr. Martin Haskell, who pioneered the procedure and has 
performed more than 1,000 of these procedures, has stated 
himself that 80 percent of the partial-birth abortions he 
does are purely elective.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. BOB DUGAN: Worst of all, the partial-birth 
abortion technique snuffs out the life of a child who is 
literally a somersault away from taking its first breath.  
How can God bless America if we allow this moral outrage to 
become the practice in our land?

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MR. BAUER: Every once in a while, a great nation 
is forced to deal with a great issue, with a defining issue 
that says something about who it is, what it is about, 
issues of race, of war, and of life.

<p>

This is one of those defining moments.  This 
moment says something about who we are as a free people.  
The founding fathers said this was a shining city upon a 
hill.  The question in 1996 is open:  Are we still a shining 
city upon a hill?

<p>

Even if this vote is lost today, the issue will 
never go away.  It will stick in our throat.  We are better 
than this.  We are a better people than this.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will 
discuss the consequences of the Senate's vote on partial-birth 
abortion.  Please stay turned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The battle between life and so-called 
choice, now spanning decades, continued most recently 
with partial-birth abortion.  Our guests tonight will 
discuss the implications of votes regarding such life 
issues.

<p>

Here tonight are three members of the Family 
Research Council's Government Relations Department.  I am 
joined by Marty Dannenfelser, assistant to the president for 
government relations; Jacqueline Halbig, congressional 
liaison; and Loralei Gilliam, legislative assistant.  All of 
you, welcome again to the show.

<p>

As you know, we are taking a look at some of the 
most significant votes that we have had, and partial birth, 
Marty, certainly was very powerful and most recent.  What do 
you see as the implications of this vote, which ultimately 
did not prevail, even though there were majorities in the 
House and the Senate?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, there were overwhelming 
majorities, particularly in the House, and increasing 
majorities in the Senate.  We went from 54 votes in the 
Senate to effectively 59, despite the 57 votes that were on 
the roll call, and many Senators who did vote against the 
override, I think, were very uncomfortable with that, 
knowing that it was a very unpopular position with the 
public.

<p>

So I think we are going to see further movement on 
that, and we got a two-thirds majority in the House on every 
occasion when the vote came up.  So I think that there is a 
lot of potential for this in the new Congress.  Congressman 
Charles Canady, the chairman of the Constitution 
Subcommittee in the House, has already indicated that he 
will be bringing this up again in the 105th Congress.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It seems like partial-birth abortion 
gave us an opportunity that we never had before to really 
talk about what happens in an abortion itself.  And so you 
have here late-term abortions, often viable children, 
healthy children, a scissors stabbed in the base of the 
skull, brain tissue vacuumed out, and the public 
overwhelmingly, as they become aware of it, saying this is 
horrendous.  I think it was something like 75 percent of 
people thought abortion only happened in cases of rape, 
incest, life of the mother, and then in the first trimester.

<p>

Do you think that partial birth has any positive 
implications in terms of its educational opportunities?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: As you noted, it really does 
cause people to focus on the reality of abortion.  In the 
past we have had so much discussion about euphemisms:  a 
woman's right to choose, keep the government out, and all 
these types of things.  And this really is very stark.  Most 
people don't realize that late-term abortions are allowed in 
this country, that they are allowed for any reason, and 
particularly this, where the baby is in the process of being 
born, I think is shocking to many people when they find out 
that this sort of thing is allowed in our country.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It seems sometimes like House and 
Senate members are locked into a position before they come.  
They run on a certain platform and then they come and kind 
of vote knee-jerk.  Did this issue help people break out of 
molds?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: I think so. You saw people 
like Jim Moran of Virginia, Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island, 
people like that, who is the nephew of Ted Kennedy, and when 
you see people like that starting to vote for this, some 
other people who had some pretty hard-line pro-abortion 
positions, it does give them the capacity to say, "This is 
different."  Many of them said, "Well, this was more like 
infanticide than abortion," which in many respects it was.
So it does give them an opportunity to finally cast a vote 
in favor of protecting life.  So that is a step, and 
hopefully, we will get them to look at other forms of 
abortion are just as heinous.

<p>

I think the analogy to what happened in England 
with the slave trade is something that is very instructive.  
William Wilberforce gradually outlawed the different methods 
of bringing the slaves on the boats, and so on, and when he 
forced people to focus on what was going on, how people were 
being held in bondage and treated very shabbily, they 
gradually said no, we can't allow that, and then no, we 
can't allow this other action.  And if people start saying, 
well, we can't allow partial-birth abortion, and then we 
can't allow the dismemberment of children, or we can't allow 
salt-poisoning of children, then perhaps they will start to 
really take a harder look at this abortion issue.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, that's fantastic.

<p>

Loralei, I know there were some other victories 
for us on the pro-life front.

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Tell us a little.

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: In the Labor, Health and Human 
Services appropriations bill, we were successful with 
looking at the education process of doctors.  The ACGME, 
which is the Accreditation Council for (Graduate) Medical 
Education, looked at training of abortion as a procedure for 
doctors.

<p>

Senator Coats took the lead on this in the Senate, 
and we were successful in keeping that in to where the 
doctors are not required or the medical schools are not 
required to learn how to perform abortions if they so 
choose.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And again, taxpayer funding was 
involved.  It was amazing to me, Marty, when we were talking 
earlier about the kinds of issues, how many involved 
taxpayer funding issues. Could you go through a couple of 
those for us?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, we renewed some things 
that had been lost in the last Congress.  When President 
Clinton first came in, he had veto threats on a number of 
bills where there had been longstanding restrictions, such 
as with the federal employees' health insurance programs, 
and that restriction, which had been in place for eight 
years, was lost in the last Congress; it was restored in 
this Congress.

<p>

On his third day in office, on the anniversary of 
<i>Roe v. Wade</i> in 1993, he handed down five executive 
memorandums on different abortion policies, one of them 
being a mandate to allow abortions in the military 
hospitals.  Now Congress has legislatively overturned that.

<p>

The District of Columbia prohibition on abortion 
on demand, funding for that, was lost in the last Congress, 
and it was renewed again in this Congress, and we did, of 
course, maintain the Hyde amendment, and as Loralei 
mentioned, the accreditation now so that these colleges that 
train doctors will not be threatened with the loss of 
federal funds if they refuse to be a party to the training 
of abortion.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I was really struck by one of the 
things that happened.  We don't often think about human 
research as happening in America.  You think of that as 
being some kind of Nazi phenomenon.  But we actually had to 
have legislation related to human embryo research, the 
creating of human beings for research purposes.

<p>

Loralei, what happened on that?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: We were successful in keeping embryo 
research from being funded.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It doesn't really allow -- they can 
still do some private funding, I guess, Marty, but they 
don't have to --

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: In federally funded programs, 
yes, they cannot be creating live human embryos for the 
purpose of experimentation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Which is ironic, because then in 
private programs they can, can they not, go ahead and use 
human beings for the purpose of research?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Yes. There is some scary stuff 
that is going on out there.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Is there any indication that if 
federal funds would be cut off we might see a little less 
human embryo research?  Although it is almost gruesome to 
think that it is happening.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: There might be a little bit, 
but it is important for the Federal Government to at least 
go on record and set the standard that this sort of thing is 
inappropriate, because when it gets federal sanction, it 
makes it that much more credible and acceptable throughout 
the entire society.  So it is an important step to say that 
that type of experimentation on living human beings is 
unacceptable.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We also took a look at funding in 
this session of Congress on international funding of 
abortion, and ironically, we might not have taxpayer-funded 
abortion in the United States, but internationally, that is 
not the case.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: No. You have a situation where 
the under secretary -- I guess his name is Tim Wirth(?) -- 
at the State Department is such a zealot in this area that 
he has a ball in the shape of a globe in his office where he 
keeps condoms, and the whole program has been promoted, and 
they have worked through the United Nations to promote this 
whole agenda.  We have managed to keep the funding in check 
because there are no longer the constraints on giving money 
to organizations that promote abortion as a method of family 
planning.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Astounding. When <i>Straight Talk</i>
returns, we will bring you more about America's fight for 
family issues within the halls of Congress.  Stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

ROBERT WOODSON: -- but use the considerable 
political and economic strength of churches and churchgoers 
and others to remove the kind of government barriers that 
prohibit faith-based organizations from properly serving 
their own peers.

<p>

REV. RONALD MOORE: -- every individual can find 
work, and whenever they find work, there is a sense of 
dignity.  It develops dignity, it develops accountability, 
it develops responsibility, and their moral and their 
ethical lives are changed, and I'm not talking about 
temporary change; we're talking about a permanent change.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As you just witnessed, some very 
controversial topics, such as immigration, affirmative 
action, and welfare reform activated the American public.  
With me to discuss some of those issues are the finest 
government relations staff in town, Family Research 
Council's Marty Dannenfelser, Jacqueline Halbig, and Loralei 
Gilliam.  Welcome back.

<p>

Marty, you all worked a lot on welfare reform, and 
there were some interesting -- people don't often think of 
Family Research Council as being involved in immigration 
policy, but there were a couple of things that caught our 
eye. What happened on these things?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, they were areas where we 
had some success in a scale-backed form from where we 
started. The welfare area, we wanted to tackle the issue of 
illegitimacy in the area of caps, and so on, and that did 
not survive.  There was a bill that passed the Congress and 
was vetoed by the President that included those types of 
provisions.

<p>

But the ultimate legislation that passed really 
ended the federal entitlement but left things largely to the 
states to design it, and even there, there were waivers that 
were still in place that are still potentially problematic.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Could you tell us a little bit more 
about caps, Jacqueline?  We were taking a look at different 
provisions. What were we hoping for when we got started?

<p>

MS. HALBIG: Well, we had pretty strong, high 
hopes, and a lot of those did not prevail, as Marty noted.
But the family caps were designed to stop the process of 
illegitimate births in families, that women kept having 
children out of wedlock and seemingly were rewarded for that 
by increased funding, and so we were trying to cap their 
funding and not allow them to get increased funding for each 
additional child that they had out of wedlock.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: But was that a desire -- I mean, it 
almost sounds kind of cold, and I ask this as a straw man 
setup question.  I mean, why caps?  Was that the most 
compassionate answer, and why would it have been?

<p>

MS. HALBIG: It seemed to work as far as a few 
experiments that took place.  One was in New Jersey, and it 
seemed to have the positive effect of not rewarding a 
negative action.  If you don't reward a negative action, 
then they won't continue to do that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Ultimately, what was the best thing, 
Marty, that came out of welfare reform?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, I think the idea that it 
did end the federal entitlement, and that is probably the 
most significant thing, and it gives much more power back to 
the states.  There have been many states that have been 
taking action that they have to keep coming on bended knee 
to the Department of Health and Human Services looking for 
waivers, and now they pretty much are on their own to design 
these programs.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Waivers would be like federal 
permission to try an experiment, to do something different.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER:  Yes, to get a waiver from the 
law dealing with Medicaid funding or some other proposal in 
the welfare area.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And so, for the first time, we are 
saying, look, we are not going to automatically give money 
if these situations exist; we are going to try to be smart 
about it. And we can actually do some experiments to try to 
change our situation?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: The idea is to try to phase it 
out at the federal level over a five-year period and then 
allow the states to put stronger work requirements and other 
things in the area of illegitimacy.  One of the areas of 
controversy with the family cap was the question of would 
that lead to increased abortions, and what they resolved was 
to say that states could get an increase if they were able 
to bring down their illegitimacy rate without increasing the 
rate of abortion.  So that was the compromise that was 
reached among people in the pro-family community who had 
some concerns in this area.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One of the things that was 
interesting this year, Gary Bauer testified on Capitol Hill 
-- President of Family Research Council -- about the 
persecution of Christians as an immigration issue.  I mean, 
we certainly have not really heard much about this in the 
past.

<p>

We have about a minute left, Loralei.  Could you 
tell us a little bit about the status of that?  What is 
happening?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: The immigration reform bill just 
went through and was passed and signed, and what it looked 
at is providing asylum.  We ran into women that were trying 
to find asylum here in the United States coming from China, 
having to deal with the human rights violations in their 
home countries.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Like forced abortion?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: Forced abortion and wanting to get 
out of their situations, and unfortunately, the 
administration was not very supportive of these women, and 
this new immigration reform looks at providing asylum for 
people that are trying to escape human rights violations.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Interesting, and I know in the 
Sudan, crucifixion of Christians, and we will probably hear 
more about this in the next session of Congress; it just got 
started.

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will continue our 
discussion on pro-family issues that were debated among 
Congressmen and Senators in the 104th Congress.  Please stay 
with us.

[Segment from PRIDE press conference on drug abuse 
prevention held September 26, 1996, follows:]

<p>

GENTLEMAN: Today marks the fifth straight year 
that we have come before you to announce that teen drug use 
is rising.  In fact, for every illicit drug and tobacco, 
drug use by students, mostly ages 11 through 18, is at the 
highest level PRIDE has ever recorded.  More students are 
using more drugs more frequently, and their use is more hard 
core than we have seen in nine years.

<p>

[Segment from Parental Rights and Responsibilities 
Act staff briefing held June 25, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MR. PAUL TUCKER: We sent our child to school one 
day with all the expectations that she is going to be going 
to school and there will be no problem, and she was informed 
that she had to go down for a physical examination.  Well, 
she thought, no problem, because my daughter does go to camp 
every summer; we do have physicals every summer for our 
children, and we do have the paperwork filled out and we 
hand that in.

<p>

My daughter decided to leave class early to go 
down to the office to explain to these nurses that she had 
the paperwork filled out, that she really didn't need a 
physical.  When she informed the nurses that she had done 
so, the nurse said, "We have lost your paperwork; you have 
to have the physical."

<p>

My daughter said, "But I already had one."  They 
said, "Well, it's too bad; you have to have one, anyway."
She said, "Well, let me call my mother."  They said, "No.
It doesn't matter what your parents think.  You are going to 
have this physical, anyway.  So it wouldn't matter what your 
mom said."

<p>

[Segments concluded.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Issues such as parental rights and 
teen drug use cut to the heart of families this year, and 
with me tonight are those who ensure factual information 
regarding these issues is provided to those making key 
decisions on Capitol Hill.

<p>

From Family Research Council, I am joined by Marty 
Dannenfelser, Jacqueline Halbig, and Loralei Gilliam.
Welcome, all, back to the show.

<p>

Jacqueline, you were tracking some of the parental 
rights issues.  What happened that affected parents and the 
way in which they make decisions for their families?

<p>

MS. HALBIG: Well, increasingly, we have just seen 
a large usurpation of parental rights in the just regular 
decisions in bringing up their children, like medical 
decisions, educational decisions, like educational choice, 
and just religious decisions.  A lot of ground has been lost 
to the state.

<p>

But this year we worked hard, as our viewers just 
saw, with Paul Tucker.  He had an incredible case where his 
child was brought in and had a gynecological exam, you know, 
for the whole world to see.  She felt very violated, 
obviously, and her parents felt like they had no recourse.

<p>

This is the Parental Rights and Responsibilities 
Act.  This is something that this bill would address.  So we 
are hopeful for next Congress as far as pursuing that 
further.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think what is interesting about 
that was not only did they give these children gynecological 
exams without parental notification or consent -- 

<p>

MS. HALBIG: That's right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  -- when they were confronted, you 
would think the school would be embarrassed and apologize, 
and they said, "Hey, we have a right, because bad parents 
might be out there."

<p>

MS. HALBIG: Right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And they were actually coming to legal loggerheads.

<p>

MS. HALBIG: Right. I mean, whose children are 
they, parents' or the government's?  Apparently, the 
government thinks that those children belong to them, and 
they have acted in such a way.

<p>

The FDA has --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Federal Food and Drug Administration.

<p>

MS. HALBIG: -- thank you -- has just also done 
something that was egregious, or we have just found out 
about it, anyway.  There has been a lady who has been making 
these home drug-testing kits so that parents could test 
their children for drugs.  What in the world is wrong with 
that? That's their right.

<p>

Well, the FDA doesn't seem to think so.  They are 
classifying these drug-testing kits, which include two urine 
sample cups and a label to send it to a lab, they are saying 
that these are a class III medical device, which is the same 
thing as a pacemaker.  Not quite.  It is not on the same 
grounds at all.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: A little plastic cup with a lid is --

<p>

MS. HALBIG: It's not quite a pacemaker, and that 
is what they are saying, so this woman who has been peddling 
these drug-testing kits has now come under fire from the FDA 
as if she has really violated the law.  So she is in danger 
of going to prison because she wants to allow parents to 
have the right to test their children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Astounding. Who are some of the 
groups that have been opposed to parental rights?  You would 
think everyone would be in favor of that.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, the National Education 
Association is one of the leading ones, and many other self-
styled child advocacy groups in the liberal community.  But 
the National Education Association, particularly in the area 
of education, they don't want parents to have any more say 
in curriculums or anything like that, so they have raised 
all kinds of horror stories about how any kind of parental 
authority is going to disrupt the classroom.

<p>

So that has been a real problem, and they have 
been an obstacle in many areas of providing school choice, 
cutting back on government mandates through the Goals 2000 
program, and so on.  So we see them rear their heads at a 
lot of turns along the way in the pro-family area.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think it has been interesting, 
too, to see what happened in pornography in the last year.
We have certainly seen some victories in pornography. But 
you look at the Internet, where children can get pornography 
easily, or have been able to, and in an attempt to restrict 
that through the telecom bill, where we were successful, the 
ACLU and others jump in, "Children need pornography," 
apparently.  And so that is a speech issue.

<p>

What else has happened on pornography?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, you run into these on-line 
companies that don't like the restrictions, as well, 
and the Microsofts, and they don't like any restrictions in 
the computer area.  So you do run into this libertarian 
group that has strong objections, and we have seen even 
within the conservative community that you run into a few 
people who have those problems.

<p>

But we have made good headway.  When people 
understand what this does to children and what kind of stuff 
is available to children, they do recoil at it, and many 
people do acknowledge that something has to be done.  The 
Senate voted 84 to 16 to pass this telecom restriction, the 
porn-on-the-internet restriction.

<p>

We had another success on getting the pornography 
out of the military as far as the commissaries on military 
bases, that the government should no longer be subsidizing 
that.  So there has been some movement in this area when 
people realize the detrimental effects this has on families.

<p>

MS. HALBIG: There is an additional success that 
just got passed, an amendment tacked onto the omnibus bill, 
which was something that Senator Hatch's staff was able to 
do.  It is an additional protection against child 
pornography on the internet.  It is computer verification -- 
when they take computer pieces of children and splice them 
together to make a whole child, traditionally, those things 
have not been considered real children so that they have 
gotten away with that kind of pornography.  But now they 
won't be able to since this has been amended.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Loralei, you work with our citizen 
action network a lot.  You are a computer guru, and tracking 
what people have to say about these things.  What is the 
constituent action network response to all these computer 
porn issues and some of the child issues that have come up?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: The initial reaction is disbelief.
So many families are just getting onto the 
internet/cyberspace activities and buying their new home 
computers and are thrilled with the new tools that it is 
going to provide.  And then they are excited to see their 
kids surfing the internet sites and going on the web and 
learning a great deal.

<p>

But at the same time, these children are able to 
access sites that provide hard-core pornography and are 
shocked by it that there are not any restrictions out there 
for that.

<p>

The telecommunications bill provided (for) the 
first time some kind of regulation going on.  Pornography 
has some form of regulation in every type of media, and this 
has allowed --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Even if it is just a driver's 
license at a video store, so that you are not giving it to 
kids.

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: Right, and this is going to provide 
a safeguard for these parents.  Our grass roots are very 
pleased with it, and almost it is like a security blanket.  
They are not scared for their kids to turn on their computer 
at home any longer.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I know we have been working for a 
long time to defund the Department of Education.  I have 
been in Washington 10 years, and I'm still hoping.  Any 
chance -- you know, there has been a lot of talk of the 
computer being great for home schools or charter schools -- 
any chance that Goals 2000 or educational choice could 
collide and there would be more parental option in our near 
future?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: It is probably going to be a 
long battle.  The entrenched bureaucracies and the unions 
are very strong in this area, and they have a lot of support 
in Congress on both sides of the aisle, and it is a tough 
battle.

<p>

But we are making headway.  There are many people 
who support parental choice, particularly many minority 
parents and lower and middle-income parents.  They see 
people at the national level, Presidents and Vice Presidents 
and other leaders of the civil rights community, and so on, 
sending their children to exclusive private schools, and 
they say, "Well, if they can afford to send their kids to 
those schools, why can't I send my kids to a school?  Why 
can't I have the wherewithal to send my kids to a private 
school?"

<p>

That is starting to put some cracks in the armor, 
so to speak, of the coalition that has been trying to limit 
parental choice.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There has been in Michigan some 
testing, some looking at ways to restructure an educational 
school system, and in New York City, the diocese which has 
consistently said to the New York City schools, "Give us 
your 1,000 poorest, worst-off children; we would be glad to 
educate them."

<p>

Do we see cracks in the armor, or when you all are 
lobbying on Capitol Hill, do the National Education 
Association and teachers' unions have the upper hand?

<p>

MS. HALBIG: They do. In a nutshell, they really 
do have the upper hand.  I don't know how to expound upon 
that, because they just have always -- they have more money 
than we do.  They control teachers, unfortunately, and they 
just have the upper hand as far as their policies are 
concerned.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to keep working 
on that.

<p>

More about your family's future when it comes to 
votes made by our congressional leaders when <i>Straight Talk</i>
returns.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. The 
Defense of Marriage Act, for which the Family Research 
Council held an exclusive briefing, was a victory in both 
the House and Senate.  Yet the homosexual activist agenda 
continues to have a profound impact in Washington.  Here 
again from the Family Research Council I am joined by Marty 
Dannenfelser, Jacqueline Halbig, and Loralei Gilliam.

<p>

Loralei, you're a southern girl.

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: That I am.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It's hard to believe, isn't it, that 
we are actually discussing in a law that marriage is between 
a man and a woman and that we had to lobby on this.  What 
was the reaction on the House and Senate when we went up to 
talk about what is marriage?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: It was amazing that we actually had 
to produce a federal piece of legislation, a law, that 
states that marriage is defined by a man and a woman.  But, 
unfortunately, we have cases in Hawaii that are going to the 
Hawaiian Supreme Court for same-sex marriage.

<p>

I don't think it is a new idea that a man and a 
woman create a marriage.  Unfortunately, the homosexual 
agenda, the folks on that side thought that we were trying 
to oppress them by saying that same-sex marriage should not 
be legal.  It's a traditional defense of the traditional 
family.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: But why would a case in a Hawaii court affect the 
rest of the country?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: Well, Article IV of the Constitution 
states that each state would have to recognize a previous 
law in another state.  So if Hawaii passed the ability for 
same-sex marriage, then Texas would have to recognize that 
marriage, even though -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You from Texas know that would not go over.

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: That would not go over, especially 
since we have sodomy laws on the books in Texas.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes. Sodomy laws are interesting.
A lot of the homosexual activists were going to go for 
sodomy laws and attack them with this legislation.  But, 
Marty, when the votes got to the Hill, did the Congressmen 
and women see the value of voting for marriage?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: They seemed to. They were able 
to split the difference in the Senate, though, because they 
had a vote the same day on what was called the Employment 
Nondiscrimination Act, which was a homosexual jobs civil 
rights type of bill that would put homosexual conduct on the 
same level as things like race, and we all know, as Colin 
Powell and others have stated, that they are very different 
things, that race is a benign characteristic that cannot 
change, whereas homosexual behavior is something that is 
changeable, and in fact thousands of people who have been in 
that lifestyle have left the lifestyle.

<p>

Yet Ted Kennedy and others in the Senate were 
determined to make that part of the law, and we have had 
examples when that has happened in other states where it has 
wreaked havoc in the work place where someone who was a 
homosexual, unbeknownst to the employer, did not get a 
promotion and then comes back and says, "Well, you didn't 
promote me because I'm a homosexual," and the employer says, 
"Well, I didn't know you were a homosexual."

<p>

Now, if that person was black, obviously, they 
would know that person was black, and they might have a case 
for saying there was discrimination.  But if the employer 
did not know they were a homosexual, they are really at 
great risk of lawsuits and all kinds of legal action that 
can cause a great deal of problem in the work place.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, it was really interesting.  You 
had the two bills, the Defense of Marriage Act, sort of 
establishing marriage in federal law and allowing the states 
to make their own decisions, going through at the same time 
as a gay civil rights bill.

<p>

I guess the question is, if how you have sex 
becomes a workplace issue, isn't this going to force 
everyone to fill out a form, "This is how I have sex"?  It 
is certainly not going to be apparent when you meet someone.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, that was one of the 
problems that we pointed out, and some of our friends in the 
Senate pointed out to their colleagues, that you are going 
to then have to start having records to demonstrate that you 
are hiring people, and then in order to have those records,
you have to start asking people, and that really starts 
invading people's privacy.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes. How do you prove it?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Correct. People don't want to 
be answering questions like that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It would seem very charged, and yet 
the vote was very close.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: It was only a one-vote margin, 
50 to 39, and one of the Senators who was absent would have 
supported that, and had he been there, Al Gore would have 
cast the deciding vote to pass that, because the Vice 
President votes to break ties.  So it was a very close vote, 
and Ted Kennedy vows that he'll be back next year and he'll 
be ready to pass that in the Senate.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And what do you think will happen? 
Do you think they'll have a chance?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, it will depend on the 
makeup of the Senate in the new Congress, and that is very 
much up in the air right now.  So I think as people realize 
more the facts about this issue that it will move in our 
direction.  As you know, we had the briefing up on the Hill, 
and we got feedback from people.  They didn't know that this 
was not a characteristic that you're born with.  They didn't 
know that there was another explanation for these sorts of 
issues, that there were thousands of people who leave that 
lifestyle and that there are ministries that help people in 
that situation.  And as they find facts like that out and 
they find out the problems that this can cause in the work 
place, they do tend to take another look at it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have about a minute left, and I 
know that one thing Family Research Council does 
consistently is fight for pro-family tax relief.
Jacqueline, what started in that front?  What did we see?

<p>

MS. HALBIG: We did see pro-family tax relief pass 
the House, and that was pretty exciting, a $500-per-child 
tax credit.  So that was a victory.  Unfortunately, it 
didn't fly in the Senate, but we did at least get that far 
in the House.  So that is encouraging.

<p>

Also along the lines of tax credits, there was an 
adoption tax credit which passed, something we have worked 
very hard for.  Because we are pro-life, we believe children 
should be adopted and give people a break who spend a lot of 
money trying to adopt children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think, what, the average cost of 
adoption is around $20,000, and this was $5,000 tax break?

<p>

MS. HALBIG: Right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That is really significant for people.

<p>

MS. HALBIG: It is significant.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There was one other change in 
adoption law, wasn't there, Loralei?

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: Yes. This was the first time that
we were able to get transracial adoptions be approved.
There is not technically a law out there that says one race 
parent could not adopt a different race child, but, 
unfortunately, that was what was happening in the adoption 
agencies.  They were not letting cross-racial adoption 
happen.  And we have put on the books now that, yes, a white 
family can adopt a Hispanic child, or a black family can 
adopt an Oriental child.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And that was something that Hillary 
Clinton and Donna Shalala had fought, as I understand.

<p>

MS. GILLIAM: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to come back 
and hear more about this when the 105th Congress comes.  
Thanks so much for being with us, and when <i>Straight Talk</i>
returns, we will bring you more information regarding issues 
affecting you and your family.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.

<p>

Have you ever wondered if women have had an impact 
on our political system; if the fact that women vote changes 
the way the world is, or at least the way the political 
system operates?  During the suffragette movement, when 
women were trying to get the vote, it was rumored that women 
were really going to change American politics, and today the 
gender gap is big news.

<p>

Just how do women view the political process, and 
what influence do they have?  We're going to hear from some 
experts who have a lot to say about how women are 
influencing the American political scene.

<p>

First, we are going to hear from Kay Coles James. 
She was former secretary of HHS in Virginia.  She is now 
head of government at Regent University, and in fact, she 
was once a vice president at Family Research Council.  She 
says that the way that women care about their families 
affects the way they care about politics.  Let's take a look 
at her insightful comments.

<p>

<i>[Note: Remarks of the participants for the 
balance of the telecast are segments from The Heritage 
Foundation Conference entitled "Women, Politics, and the 
1996 Elections," held September 27, 1996.]</i>

<p>

MS. JAMES: One media outlet says that there is 
something out there called Soccer Mom, and Soccer Mom is in 
fact the woman that both Bob and Bill are interested in 
dating right now.  She is one whose attentions they are all 
vying for.

<p>

Who is this person called Soccer Mom?  Now, those 
individuals who are doing the scientific polling will tell 
you precisely who she is.  I will only tell you what my 
impressions are of who she is.

<p>

And just for the sake of continuity, I have 
decided to name her, and I only picked this name because it 
is my daughter's, and when I've done this before, I've 
switched names four times within the speech because I forgot 
what I named her.  So let's call her Elizabeth.

<p>

Well, Elizabeth is, let's say, somewhere in her 
thirties.  She is a very active woman.  She is holding down 
a full-time job working outside the home.  She is sandwiched 
between her children and her aging parents.  Elizabeth has a 
lot on her mind.  While there are those in the nation who 
are figuring out how to balance the nation's budget, she is 
trying to figure out how to stretch the paycheck.

<p>

She is so very, very committed to being 
responsible with the family's finances.  She is not late on 
the bills, but boy, can she juggle that budget to make it 
all happen.  She is an incredible woman.  She cares deeply 
about her children, and she is very concerned about the 
future of this nation.

<p>

Now, when we ask Elizabeth how she feels about the 
upcoming election, there are three words that she picked out 
of a list for some research that was done for <i>Ladies' Home 
Journal</i>. She said, when asked to describe her feeling about 
politics, she says there are three adjectives:  frustrated, 
disgusted, and disillusioned.

<p>

I would like to add to that that right now 
Elizabeth is so engrossed in her own life that perhaps, just 
perhaps, even with the election as close as it is, she has 
not yet focused all of her time and attention on what is 
happening in national politics.  Right now Elizabeth is more 
concerned that if Bob could drive carpool for her this 
weekend and Bill could figure out how in the world she is 
going to get home from work, defrost dinner, get one child 
to piano lessons and the other one to a dance recital, then 
perhaps she would have time to concentrate on what they are 
saying.

<p>

My point to you is that I believe that Elizabeth 
and the other Soccer Moms out there are a very fluid group 
right now.  And if our national candidates could learn how 
to reach through the noise of their everyday lives, then 
perhaps they could get to her and persuade her that one of 
the two of them is the best choice to lead this nation.

<p>

Well, this particular Soccer Mom has, well, let's 
say for the sake of argument, a combined family income of
around $30,000, and she works as a loan officer in a bank.
Her husband works for the telephone company.

<p>

I just want to take you through Elizabeth the 
Soccer Mom's day and sort of set the stage for some of the 
things that you will be hearing.

<p>

Elizabeth turns over at 5:30 a.m., and as she 
smashes the clock down because its whining is driving her 
insane -- it came much, much too early, but, you see, she 
has to get up very, very early in order to prepare her 
children, herself, and, yes, her husband, in order to go out 
and face their work day.

<p>

Now, there are some things that are influencing 
Elizabeth's life at that moment that she doesn't even know 
about.  She isn't even aware of the fact that perhaps the 
reason that she is getting up and going out and facing a job 
and working that day is because the economy is as it is, and 
in order for her family to be able to survive, they need 
those two incomes.  And she isn't perhaps aware of the fact 
that while she is working 15 hours out of her week in order 
to pay her taxes and she only gets to spend 17 hours out of 
her week in one-on-one time with her children, that she is 
working almost as much time for the government as she is 
working for her children.  And someone needs to get that 
message through to her, so that when we begin to talk about 
a 15 percent tax cut, Elizabeth understands immediately what 
impact that's going to have on her and on her family.

<p>

Well, Elizabeth rouses those kids and gets them 
ready, and as she readies them for school, she begins to 
think about the kinds and the quality of education that her 
children are getting.  Now, she is very committed to public 
education.  Make no mistake about it.  She wants a good 
quality education in that community.  But her primary and 
her first responsibility is to her own children.  It is very 
important to her that they have the best education possible, 
and she somehow fears that her wealthier friends who can 
send their children to private school are getting a better 
edge, because when she looks at the standardized test 
results, for whatever reason, those children are scoring 
higher.

<p>

Now, she figures if we can get a little 
competition in there and somehow drive this issue, that 
perhaps we can improve the public schools, and Elizabeth 
believes, much like Polly Williams, that Bill Clinton should 
not be the only person who lives in public housing and sends 
his kids to private school.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

And she would love to take her tax dollars that 
she is spending, she would love to take that money and use 
it to send her children to the school that she chooses, 
because she understands their unique gifts, abilities, and 
needs, and she wants to make the decision about what kinds 
of education her children receive.  Elizabeth is very 
concerned about what she sees happening in public schools in 
America today.

<p>

And so Elizabeth puts the children in the car, and 
she begins to drive off to drop them off for their day in 
public schools.  She is mortified as she drives through the 
neighborhood and goes through a shortcut to get there and 
cut off a few minutes so she won't be late for work, drives 
through a neighborhood that she doesn't always take to get 
there, and is horrified, mortified, petrified, as she sees 
what she believes to be a drug deal going on not more than a 
few blocks from her child's school.

<p>

Now, Elizabeth is very concerned about crime and 
drugs.  She somehow had gotten a sense of security when she 
saw the data that came out several years ago saying that 
casual use among teenagers was down, and she was glad to 
have Nancy Reagan stand up there and tell the children of 
America, "Just say no."  She wasn't smirking, she wasn't 
making light of drug use, and it was exactly the same 
message that she was giving at home.

<p>

And so she felt a certain amount of security, and 
if Elizabeth had time and was listening to the evening news, 
she knows that the gains that we made under President Bush 
have in fact evaporated and that drug use among teens is up, 
and that is frightening to her, because she cares about her 
children, and she doesn't want leadership in this country 
that says, "Yes," with a smile, "I used drugs, and if I had 
the opportunity, I would do it over again."

<p>

Well, she drops them off.  Finally now, Elizabeth 
is headed to work.  She works very hard all day, and when it 
gets to be lunch time, Elizabeth has several phone calls 
that she needs to make on her break.  You see, as a sandwich 
mom, meaning that she is sandwiched between her children and 
her elderly parents, usually at least two to three times a 
week she tries to call her mom and dad at lunchtime.  And 
when she calls them, her father is horrified, saying, "Have 
you heard what they're trying to do to Medicare?"  He is 
frightened.

<p>

She says, "Dad, think about it this way.  What if 
you had a limited amount of money and you looked ahead to 
the end of the month and you realized, Dad, that if you 
didn't spend your money wisely, you were going to run out of 
money before you got to the end of the month?  Now, you have 
two options, Dad.  You can either begin to cut back and 
scale back and maybe change your diet a little bit, or you 
could decide, 'I'm going to worry about it later; let's have 
steak and lobster for dinner tonight.'"

<p>

And Dad said, "Well, of course not.  I would 
figure out how to make it work, how to stretch the limited 
dollars that I have so that we can eat all month."  And she 
said, "Dad, that's what Republicans are trying to do.  And 
in fact, they are not talking about spending less money on 
the food budget; they are talking about spending more, but 
we are not going to increase it as much and as fast, because 
we simply don't have the resources to do that.

<p>

"Dad, they really do want to save Medicare and to 
make sure that in fact you will always have adequate medical 
coverage."  Elizabeth has a lot on her mind.

<p>

But, you know, her boss comes to her in mid-afternoon 
and says, "You know, we have a little bit of a 
problem in balancing out our books.  We're going to need you 
to stay and work a little late," so that, by the time she 
finally leaves work that night, it's dark outside, the 
streets are a little more quiet than they normally are, and 
she has to walk the two blocks that she has to go to get 
into her car.  She sees shadows as she walks to her car, and 
she is angry that Bill Clinton cut prison funding by $580 
million, because some of those people need to be locked up 
and behind bars.

<p>

And so I think that you are beginning to see that 
there is a lot that is happening at the national level that 
can be, should be, and is indeed important to Elizabeth.

<p>

As she makes it home that night, prepares the 
family's meal, and then sits down to watch the evening news, 
there are two more things that come to her attention.  
Elizabeth looks at what is happening internationally, and 
she recognizes that as she looks at her 17-year-old son and 
thinks about her brother who is a Marine, she is very 
concerned that in America's foreign policy that perhaps, 
just perhaps, we are committing American forces to places on 
our globe with missions that are ill-defined; we aren't sure 
what victory looks like; and we're not really clear why 
we're there.

<p>

And that is important because, see, Elizabeth is 
patriotic, and she has taught her son that he will fight for 
and defend freedom and that one day he may be called upon to 
do just that.  But she wants to be sure that when her son or 
her brother is put in harm's way, that it is for a reason 
that is of some vital interest to America.  And she also 
wants to know that he is the best equipped, that he is the 
best trained, and that he has all the tools and resources at 
his disposal to do the job.  She does not want to be one of 
those mothers of one of the rangers who went into Somalia 
and then later was told that some of the defense officials 
should have acted upon requests that came from some of the 
commanders that they needed more equipment and heavier 
armor.  You see, that would be cold comfort to her.

<p>

She wants to know that America's military is 
standing ready and well prepared.  And so that is important 
to her.  She is concerned about what she hears about 
military morale that has hit an all-time low.  She is very 
concerned as she listens to the evening news that perhaps 
America is not prepared to face the international 
challenges.

<p>

And so Elizabeth may not have focused entirely on 
the election yet, and Bob and Bill may still be courting.  
She will have the opportunity to focus on what that means to 
her in terms of education, in terms of crime, in terms of 
drugs, in terms of a strong national defense, in terms of a 
definable national foreign policy.  Because, you see, 
Elizabeth cares about all those things because, yes, she is 
a woman, but she is also an American.

MS. MAC LEOD: It is very important, as we talk 
about women and politics here in 1996, that we have some 
context to put that into.  We must understand the patterns 
of feminism, we must understand some of the past of feminism 
in order to be put there, and I am really glad to see a lot 
of people that are in my age group, because we are the ones 
who have received a very narrow view as we have been raised 
of the feminist movement.

<p>

I did my graduate thesis on the defeat of the 
Equal Rights Amendment in Iowa in 1992, and the reason I 
chose that topic was because as I talked to people in my age 
group, I discovered that we did not know what the Equal 
Rights Amendment was all about.  We knew there was this 
brouhaha over it when we were young, back in the 1970s, but 
we didn't know what the issues were that surrounded it.  The 
only things we had ever been taught were what we read in our 
textbooks, that the ERA was about equal pay for equal work. 
And, of course, that was not all that the Equal Rights 
Amendment was about.

<p>

So I am starting off today just bringing up a very 
poignant figure in American feminism, a woman named Betty 
Friedan, whom I am sure you have all heard of.  As I started 
working on my thesis, I thought, well, I really need to dive 
into the concepts and the ideologies of feminism to 
understand these women, where they were coming from.

<p>

So I picked up a copy of <i>The Feminine Mystique</i>,
and, of course, believing I would completely disagree with 
everything Betty Friedan said, I began to read. And to my 
horror, I was agreeing with her. And I read, and I read, 
and I remember sitting in the library, and before I knew it, 
I had read 125 pages straight of this book, and I thought, 
Something's wrong.  I'm agreeing with this woman.  I'm not 
supposed to agree with Betty Friedan.

<p>

And so I stepped back and thought, Okay, what is 
it that she accomplished?  I had recently ended a 
relationship, so I knew I was going to be coming out of grad 
school with no strings, no marriage prospects, would be 
heading off into the career world, would be getting a job, 
supporting myself, and I thought, I can identify with the 
things she is saying in this book.  She wrote that book to 
women who were either newly out of school and headed off to 
a career in the 1960s or women who were married, 
intelligent, a lot of them starting out, of course, Smith 
women, who were not fulfilled because they were at home 
doing laundry and changing diapers, and in many cases, that 
is about all they were doing.

<p>

And so she took some very real fears that I 
believe every women who has any education at all and any 
ambition at all faces, she took those fears, and she said, 
"Okay, if you have these concerns" -- and remember, these 
were concerns that all women have -- "then you're a 
feminist, and this is the road that you must travel."

<p>

An entire generation of young women began to read 
her work and began to agree.  "Oh, I agree with her.  I must 
be a feminist."  And that is how a lot of the masses of 
feminism as we know it, as modern feminism, really got 
moving.

<p>

But, of course, we know that the core of the 
feminist movement in the 1960s and 1970s was actually very 
radical.  So we saw this big battle in the 1970s over the 
Equal Rights Amendment, and of course, I don't know how many 
of you realize that the word "woman" does not appear in that 
amendment once.  It wasn't about women.  It was about 
something much deeper. It was about eradicating any gender 
differences and gender roles whatsoever.

<p>

Now, I just got married recently, and I am 
starting to say, anybody who is married knows that there are 
major differences between men and women, which doesn't mean 
we are not equal.  Of course, we believe that men and women 
are equal not only under the law but under God.  But there 
are definite differences.

<p>

Women were given equal rights in the 1964 Civil 
Rights Act and the 1972 Equal Employment Act.  These were 
situations where we didn't need an Equal Rights Amendment.

<p>

Well, the feminists lost in the 1970s.  Women, by 
and large, did not buy into the gender feminist perspective. 
So the feminists were unsuccessful in the 1970s.

<p>

They spent the 1980s taking the Equal Rights 
Amendment battle to the state level.  They fought it state 
by state by state.  Many states, like Illinois, had to fight 
it 12 times in a row.  Then in 1992 we had the last major 
battle on this issue, and that was in Iowa, and once again 
they lost, and once again they lost because American women 
still are not buying into this radical, hardened, gender 
feminist perspective.

<p>

So, today, who are American women?  Well, I will 
give you one example.  We at Concerned Women for America 
really do believe that we represent most American women.  Of 
course, the National Organization for Women wants to tell 
the world that we don't, that we're radical, that we're 
extreme.  I don't really think I look like an extremist, and 
I don't think I look very radical.  But that's what they 
tell the world.

<p>

But we decided to find a polling organization that 
has a good national reputation and say, What do American 
women believe?  Not CWA members.  We want to know what 
American women truly believe.

<p>

We found out that the social issues were the most 
important to American women today.  Fourteen percent said 
that crime was their top issue.  Eight percent said that 
declining moral values were important.

<p>

When we asked women if they considered themselves 
a feminist, 60 percent said no; 26 percent said yes; and 9 
percent said somewhat.  And that fits what is happening with 
the feminist lingo today.  It is getting into this nebulous 
field, and no one is sure what feminism really is anymore.

<p>

People were asked their total favorable view of 
National Organization for Women.  Only 36 percent had a 
favorable view of NOW.  That's very significant.  That's 
something we're not hearing in the media, but it's something 
that's important when you're considering women today and 
their voting patterns.

<p>

I think this was the most exciting statistic for 
us.  We discovered that eight out of ten women said that 
they would rather stay home with their children if they were 
financially able to do it.  It's not that we believe that 
women have to stay home or they should stay home, but we 
keep hearing over and over and over that women have careers 
and that that's more important, and, you know, children, 
just plug them into day care.  But eight out of ten women 
said, "If I could afford to, I would stay home."

<p>

But we have a very conservative group of women in 
this country, women that, when the media talks and says that 
women speak with one voice, they're wrong.  The liberal 
women out there and the conservative women out there exist, 
but they are in two very distinct camps, and as we look 
towards the elections, we need to realize that attaching the 
"women" label to one group no longer suffices.

<p>

<p>

MS. CORSO: Right now you can hear of a gender gap 
anywhere from 20 percent to 32 percent.  While men right now 
are statistically even in their vote for Dole or Clinton, 
women by far prefer Bill Clinton.  If you go back to 
Eisenhower, even for Kennedy, women voted more conservative 
then.  For Reagan's 1984 election, women eked out men just 
by two percentage points, 51-49 for Reagan.  However, now, 
as we see, it is anywhere -- 57 is the last I had heard, 57 
percent Clinton, 31 percent Dole, for women.

<p>

Why? Well, first of all, women support government 
programs more.  Government is not a bad thing for them.  
They would like to see it cut back a little bit, but the 
government is a protector.  That is why they look to the 
government.  Men want the government gone.  Big government 
is bad to them.  Big government is what is taking away the 
things that they want, things that they need.  They are more 
concerned with take-home pay and things like that, whereas 
the woman wants to know that the government is going to look 
out for, again, her children.

<p>

She is also very concerned about social spending. 
She wants to know that the government will be able to take 
care of her parents, whereas the husband is concerned about 
his parents -- he is not going to just ship them off, but 
the burden again comes on the wife to make sure not only her 
parents are taken care of but his parents are taken care of, 
also.  That is why she is concerned that the government is 
not going to cut out Medicare.

<p>

Welfare is also important to women.  They agree 
that right now the welfare state is not the way it should 
be, but don't get rid of it.  Trim it.  Cut it back.  Make 
it streamlined.

<p>

Women, though, are much more conservative when it 
comes to cultural value issues, drugs and crime.  Children 
who take drugs are a mother's worst nightmare.  They also 
worry, I am allowing my child to walk to school.  What's 
going to happen on his or her way home?  This is a big, big 
concern.

<p>

Crime is also a concern when it comes to 
punishment.  Women want to see these criminals punished, but 
they also want to see them rehabilitated.  People are not 
generally bad.  A man wants to see the guy put away for as 
long as possible.  That's another huge difference.

<p>

Women want to see the jails restructured, not just 
build more but restructure them, do more in the ways of a 
halfway house, allow a criminal who is not a violent 
offender to come out and try to get him or her back into 
society.  If, however, it is a rapist or it is someone who 
has done any crime towards children, you can throw that out 
the window.  They want that person put away for as long as 
possible.

<p>

Right now the gap, the infamous gender gap, comes 
from not just the big difference between men and females but 
also from the difference between women.  There is a group 
being courted very, very strongly by the Dole and Clinton 
camps.  Anxious white females, instead of angry white males, 
is what they are being called. Or the Soccer Moms.  These 
are suburban, they are married, they work and they stay at 
home, depending.  They have to work because they need the 
second income.  They really do not want to.  They want to 
take their kids to soccer practice.  They want to work for 
the PTA.  They want to volunteer in the library.  However, 
they just can't.  They need the second income.  It makes 
them a little bit bitter.

<p>

Their age ranges from 35 to 54, and their 
household income is about $40,000 and up.  This is perfectly 
the middle class.

<p>

Right now, they are leaning very strongly towards 
Bill Clinton.  They feel that Bill Clinton is not the 
greatest President we've ever had -- they'll never admit to 
that -- but he is the better of the two choices.

<p>

Why are they against Bob Dole?  A lot of it is his 
age.  They all have parents who are hitting the same age 
right now.  They see what their parents go through.  Bill 
Clinton is young.  Bill Clinton is their age.  He has a 
daughter.  He knows what it's like trying to get that 
daughter into ballet school and making sure she gets into 
the right college.  These are the worries and concerns these 
people have.

<p>

Bill Clinton's character is also not that much of 
an issue to these people.  Character is not going to be the 
deciding factor.  They actually may see him a little bit 
better for all the problems that have happened.  He is able 
to stand up to these attacks.  Nothing has stuck to him.  
Therefore, he is just standing tough and bouncing back.

<p>

They also like Hillary. She is someone who is 
standing by her husband.  She is someone who is trying to 
raise Chelsea and having attacks thrown at her left and 
right.  Yet she is still standing there; she is still 
smiling.

<p>

These women also love Elizabeth Dole, so there is 
going to be no head-to-head here between the First Ladies.  
She is someone who, again, is standing by her husband and 
someone who knows the burden of working and trying to take 
care of her family, Bob Dole.

<p>

Women -- you can change.  Republicans can focus 
more towards women, and there are three ways to do this.  
The first way is focus on the children.  Democrats and 
Republicans have always talked about today and all that.  
You will notice now they are talking about the future, our 
children.  Everyone, all women are going to empathize with 
that.

<p>

You also see today that the drug issue has become 
forefront.  Every ad we see is about drugs.  The two camps 
know this is a way to appeal to the women, to allow the 
women to come front and center.

<p>

Women also make up their minds late.  This swing 
voter, this Soccer Mom group, they are leaning towards 
Clinton, but they are not definite.  They could change their 
minds.  And what is going to happen is the way that they 
talk about children, the way they talk about drugs is what 
is going to lean them one way or the other.

<p>

It is also the family.  The family is very 
important.  Family values got played up in 1992.  "Family 
values" as a catch phrase is not going to work.  True 
feeling towards the families, seeing how people, how the 
members of Congress, how Clinton, how Dole react to their 
own families and family problems -- women are not fooled by 
the words; they need to see.  They need to see what these 
people are going to do.

<p>

You can't just talk to women; you have to listen 
to women, also.  Big difference.  Men, you can talk to them. 
Men will listen, they'll sit, they'll think about it, 
they'll go off.  Women have to have a dialogue.  That is 
another big difference.  You can talk to a woman, but if you 
don't give her a chance to talk back to you, then you're 
going to lose that woman right there.

<p>

<p>

MS. BOWMAN: I have been looking at gender issues 
for quite a long time and, as a matter of fact, did my first 
study of gender issues going back to the early survey data 
from the 1930s, and I thought I would talk a little bit 
about the differences that we have seen over time and about 
where we are today.  Of course, there weren't as many 
pollsters in the 1930s as there are today, but they asked, 
actually, I think, perhaps more interesting questions than 
the pollsters are asking today over a broad range of issues 
overall.

<p>

If you look at the data from the 1930s to the 
early 1970s, the pattern appeared to be pretty similar.  
There were some areas where men and women differed 
significantly and many areas where they didn't differ at 
all.  The so-called women's issues, defined very differently 
in that period than they are today, produced hardly any 
differences between men and women.  There are not 
significant differences between men and women today on 
something like abortion.  There are more significant 
differences by age.  But there were also no differences in 
this earlier period.

<p>

From the earliest of survey history, men and women 
have differed very significantly on when it is proper for a 
society to use force, very broadly defined:  sending troops 
abroad, gun control, the death penalty.  If you look back to 
the Persian Gulf War, you can see gender chasms on some 
questions involving, for example, the acceptability of 
civilian casualties, men saying completely acceptable, women 
saying not acceptable.  So this is an area that has always 
differentiated the sexes.

<p>

Another area, in the early period, women were less 
likely to be informed, less likely to have opinions, and I 
think, as Regina said, there is still evidence of that in 
the polls today.  Women are not necessarily less likely to 
be informed; they are clearly lagging indicators in terms of 
making their views known, making up their minds.  If you 
look, for example, at attitudes about Jack Kemp in some of 
the polls, they are more positive than negative among women, 
extraordinarily positive among men.  But over a third to 40 
percent of women don't have an opinion yet about Jack Kemp. 
They are lagging indicators.

<p>

You see this in a number of different areas.
Women took a long time to be convinced that the fundamental 
nature of the Soviet Union had changed.  Men were pretty 
convinced early on.  After Gorbachev, it became clear to 
them that the situation had changed dramatically.

<p>

The economy is a very important issue where women 
tend to be a lagging indicator, perhaps because they are 
more concerned, as Regina said, with families, and those are 
the first things that come to their minds in thinking about 
supporting their families.  But women are much less likely 
to believe, or much slower to believe, that the recession 
has ended, that the economy is getting better, again 
suggesting another fundamental difference.

<p>

But in that early period from 1930 to 1970, that 
was about all that we learned:  differences on the use of 
force, women less likely to have opinions, similarities on 
many issues overall, and no differences on the so-called 
women's issues.

<p>

If you look from 1975 on, new things began to 
appear in the data, and while I think it is dangerous to tie 
attitudinal data to demographic data, clearly, there are 
some links.  Women were coming back into the work force in 
significant numbers after the war experience, when, of 
course, they had been active in the work force and then out 
of the work force for a while.  Coming back in, they were at 
the lowest rung of the economic ladder, first hired, first 
fired, and many of them were heading single families.  So 
the interaction of those demographic trends, I think, 
produced some of the changes that we saw in the attitudinal 
data.

<p>

Some things stayed the same.  Women continued to 
be slower to form firm opinions than did men.  So-called 
women's issues, once again, no differences between men and 
women.

<p>

We saw some new areas that we had not seen before, 
and those are the most important because they are what 
Regina addressed most dramatically.  One, the minor issue:  
women appear to be more risk-averse than men, Shannon Lucid 
notwithstanding.  When Gallup asked the question about 
whether you'd like to ride on the space shuttle, there's a 
35 percentage point difference between men and women on that 
question.  Most women do not want to ride on the space 
shuttle; most men think it would be a great idea to go up 
and give that a try.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

But again, you don't see a gap of 35 percentage 
points on many questions in survey research.  This is a 
gender chasm.  So the risk issues -- the location of nuclear 
power plants, chemical additives in food, safety and health 
issues overall -- women appear to be more risk-averse.

<p>

And then the final area that I thought Regina 
covered so well involves attitudes about the proper role of 
government in the society.  Women, by just about every poll 
that I see, favor a stronger role for government.  That 
isn't to say that they want government involved in their 
lives in an overwhelming way, but they do favor a stronger 
role for government.

<p>

I am just going to touch on three questions that 
were asked recently on issues involving government and see 
how you would respond to the questions, and then I will tell 
you how most men and women responded to those questions.

<p>

In early September, CBS and the <i>New York Times</i>
included two questions in their national survey that
underscored the deep skepticism that both sexes have about 
government.  But when asked to assess what kind of an impact 
government has on most people's lives -- is it negative, is 
it positive, or doesn't government have much impact at all? 
-- the national results, 42 percent said the impact of 
government was negative, 32 percent said positive, and 16 
percent said that government didn't have any impact on their 
lives at all.  But women were much more likely to say that 
government had a positive impact than were men.

<p>

Another question in the same poll:  Is government 
doing too many things better left to business and 
individuals, or should government be doing more to solve our 
country's problems?  Think about how you would answer that. 
Well, 62 percent of all Americans said that government was 
doing too much, and 28 percent said that government should 
be doing more, again a pretty clear opinion overall.  But 
once again, women were stronger on the pro-government side. 
Both men and women were negative about government, but 
women favored the government role more strongly than men.

<p>

But when the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> posed a question on 
their September 7-10 poll, they asked people which idea came 
closer to their own idea about government. The first 
statement was, "Government should provide tools to help 
families better their lives, such as education and job 
training."  The other formulation was, "The best thing that 
government can do for families is to cut taxes and allow 
individual families to decide for themselves how to allocate 
their money" -- very much what Bob Dole is talking about in 
trusting the people.

<p>

The overall percentages:  47 percent that 
government should provide tools to help families, 43 percent 
that the best thing government could do was get out -- a 
public pretty evenly split overall, but once again, women 
came down more strongly on the pro-government side.  Again, 
men and women were not overwhelmingly different on these 
questions, but it persists.  It is what we call in survey 
research patterned.  It is always there.  Women take the 
slightly stronger role for government overall.

<p>

So those areas have stood out in the research, and 
I think that is what is driving the gender gap that we are 
seeing in the Presidential-level polling overall.  We don't 
see it as much when you are asked about individual 
congressional races, and I think that that is because 
individual Republican Congressmen have dealt better with a 
lot of these issues in their districts in terms of talking 
about what is on their agenda than perhaps Bob Dole has 
overall.

<p>

But Republicans and conservatives have an enormous 
amount of work to do.  We cannot deny these very significant 
numbers that we are now seeing in this election overall.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. JAMES: Well, you see, politics is a very 
complex game here, and it is also very important for us as 
women to be as sophisticated about how that works, and so 
what that means for me is that not only is it important for 
the issues that I care about, but it is also very important 
for me that I look, as chairs of the various subcommittees, 
that I look for the leadership in the House, so it is 
important for me that Trent Lott stays there.  And if I 
lived in an area where I had two choices -- thankfully, I 
don't -- two bad choices, I would always go for the person 
that is going to keep Trent Lott and Newt there.  I mean, I 
would, because that is important for the overall, global, 
larger picture.  And so we are sophisticated enough to 
understand that and to be able to work with that.

<p>

MS. MILLER: We have talked about depending upon 
the age of the women makes a difference.  We have talked 
about employment status.  What about family status, whether 
they are married or not married, and how does that make a 
difference in voting patterns?  I don't know who wants to 
take a stab at that.

<p>

MS. BOWMAN: There is also a marriage gap, and in 
some surveys it is larger than the gender gap.  It is a 
very, very significant gap, with married voters being more 
Republican and single voters being more Democratic.

<p>

Married voters tend to turn out to vote.  They 
have more of a stake in the society.  We like to say that 
once you get a mortgage, a marriage, and children, that you 
are drawn back into the political process, and that is, I 
think, what the political science literature suggests, and 
clearly, there are significant marriage gaps.

<p>

MS. MAC LEOD:  . . . is when you look at this 
economy, fundamentally, we started in this nation on a 
premise that the family was the thing that would drive the 
economy; and as you have successful families and family 
businesses, you are going to filter that up, and you are 
going to end up having a successful economy.

<p>

So I think there is definitely merit to that as 
far as the families are getting smaller, people aren't 
focusing on family businesses, people aren't thinking about 
the family in terms of the economy in many instances these 
days, just at the grass-roots level, and I think that could 
have an effect.

<p>

As far as for Betty Friedan, I would just say you 
have just exemplified and pointed out the shift that the 
feminist movement has taken.  They hit on the social issues, 
and some of the more radical social issues, for so long, and 
they have suddenly discovered that women, younger women 
today, don't care, because they have never been told they 
can't get a certain kind of job.  They have never been 
discriminated against in any way, shape, or form.  And so 
when they are presented with this radical social agenda, 
they say, "Take a hike.  This doesn't affect me."

<p>

But the economy and their pocketbook is the one 
area that they are still able to have some sway.  So that is 
the direction that feminism, from a policy perspective, has 
been moving in the last few years.

<p>

MS. MILLER: Laurel, I remember the U.N. Fourth 
World Conference.  There are a lot of interesting things 
that they did in terms of the platform, and I do want you to 
mention a couple in terms of how the word "family" and how 
the word "mother" were recrafted, and it did not appear in a 
mainstream press in this country at all.  They just said, 
"We're doing wonderful things for women.  The Hillary 
Clinton speech is really going to uplift women around the 
globe."

<p>

Yet, at the same time -- you made an interesting 
comment about how they've taken this agenda that didn't work 
on the federal level, hasn't worked on the state level; it 
has gone to the international level.  Would you just mention 
a couple of those?

<p>

MS. MAC LEOD: I will give you some wonderful 
examples. Households, family -- they defined family and 
violence against women -- we are seeing a lot lately about 
violence against women, and of course, we are all women, and 
we would say no, we are not in favor of violence against 
women. But this U.N. document defined violence against 
women as always being home-based, and men are the abusers of 
women and children, and that is how this document put it.  
It was an occasion to go man-bashing rather than to address 
real concerns and issues of crime.

<p>

As far as motherhood, they sought to take out the 
word "mother," to remove the word "mother" from the document 
and replace it with "caretaker," or "household."  When they 
are taking about family, they want to talk about household, 
not family, because it is a system now -- and, of course, 
the gender feminism here in the West, especially in the 
United States, is really driving that -- gender, again, 
socially constructed.  They refused to define the word 
"gender" in the document.

<p>

So you have, for all intents and purposes, a 200-
page document that talks about gender all the way through, 
and yet it is never defined, because when push came to shove 
-- and I know Victor Morero(?) was pushed to the wall by 
Congressman Chris Smith in a hearing summer before last -- 
he said, "I'm sorry, we can't define gender as male and 
female, because there are large segments of society that 
believe it is socially constructed."

<p>

That was the position of our United States 
delegation.  That is the position that was maintained in 
Beijing.  There is no definition of gender, which is 
ludicrous.  When you look at any bill here in the United 
States, we have findings for bills in Congress.  We also 
have definitions for terms, because we know that, legally, 
if you don't define your terms, the sky is the limit in how 
they can be implemented.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i>, we stand with the American Family
Association and recognize Pornography Awareness Week.

<p>

Pornography permeates our society in a variety of 
forms, most of which we try to keep from children.  Yet 
pornography has entered a new, more accessible frontier, 
cyberspace.  Child pornography and other hard-core obscenity 
travels through cyberspace at an alarming pace and not only 
reaches children, who are often more adept on the computer 
than their parents, but also abuses children by portraying 
them in a sexual manner.

<p>

In fact, it is not illegal to send a child hard-core filth 
through e-mail or to make it easy for kids to 
find obscene pictures of sex and sexual-mutilation deaths.
Children, women, and men, though pornography addiction, are 
all victims of a multi-million-dollar pornography industry. 
And it is of particular concern now, because President 
Clinton has pledged to get every school hooked up on the 
Internet, a sometimes dangerous computer playground.
Tonight we talk to two key players in this crucial battle 
against pornography.

<p>

But first, let's talk about the election less than 
one week away.  The majority of U.S. voters are women, whose 
voices both inside and outside the beltway can no longer be 
ignored.  It is important for conservatives and liberals 
alike to learn how to talk to this constituency of women, to 
win their hearts and their votes.

<p>

Let's hear how women at a special Heritage 
Foundation event addressed this gender issue, as we take you 
Behind the Headlines.

<p>

<p>

[Segments from The Heritage Foundation Conference 
entitled "Women, Politics, and the 1996 Elections," held 
September 27, 1996, follow:]

<p>

MS. BLAIR: In America today, the term "working 
family" is practically an oxymoron.  You can work or you can 
have a family, but it is awfully, awfully hard to have both. 
The reason why that happens is, quite simply, the tax 
burden. The tax burden is what drives the second person in 
the family into the work force, as we have seen from the CWA 
poll, which showed that 80 percent of women, if they could, 
would stay home with their children.

<p>

What drives the tax burden?  It is often called 
women's interests, but what it really is is interest groups' 
interests.  Those are the folks who want to get every 
taxpayer in America to contribute one penny so that they can 
do this good thing, and those pennies add up, and you find 
that you've got folks working very, very hard to pay the 
government and try to manage to have a decent life for 
themselves.

<p>

If you look at the social issues, it seems to me 
that one thing we really cannot deny is that money has not 
solved those problems, and we would all have to acknowledge 
that it is going to be time and attention that solves those 
problems. Unfortunately, the more government we have, the 
more we are simply throwing money at those problems and not 
time and attention; and the more we drive women unwillingly 
into the work force and drive taxes up to take money away 
from families, the more we are simply doing the wrong thing 
for those problems.

<p>

The women who would like to be at home, the women 
who would like to be able to do volunteer work in their 
communities, so they say, would be exactly the people who 
would be doing volunteer work in their communities to help 
these social problems, who would be raising their children 
in a way that they felt confident that the children would 
turn out to be okay and solve some of those social problems.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MS. ARNETT: Let's listen to what women are 
saying.  And I think that something I am hearing today is, 
as a conservative women, I don't understand why the polls 
show that women are so overwhelmingly supporting Bill 
Clinton, because he stands for everything that I as a 
conservative woman think is contrary to our interests.

<p>

I believe that conservative women are really at 
the critical threshold of being the most important voice and 
the one that is the least heard in this debate, because 
conservative women have a sense of a society in which values 
matter and the individual and the family are the center of 
decisionmaking, not the government; in which there is a 
balance between different levels of government, where 
community service is something that we consider to be 
something that we want to do, where children and the future 
generations are something that we think about every day.

<p>

When you have a government that -- the classic 
quote -- "a government who can give you everything you want 
is a government who can take away everything you have," and 
there is just this disconnect with women being concerned 
about the future, being compassionate, wanting security, and 
yet all of the programs that have been shown by liberal 
agendas in which government controls the center of power are 
against the things that women most, in my sense, value.

<p>

So I think, as conservative women, we have an 
obligation to help others understand the consequences of 
these government policies.  And I also think women, in a lot 
of ways, are the ones who suffer most right now from the 
policy fixes that we most need.

<p>

The taxation and the tax treatment of health 
insurance is a tremendous problem that drives many of the 
distortions that we see in the current system.  For example, 
let's take two people, one woman who is working two jobs -- 
she may be divorced, she may be a single mom -- with two 
kids, and she doesn't have health insurance.  She is 
working. She is trying to provide for herself, for her 
family. She has stretched time and resources absolutely to 
the limit. She doesn't have health insurance, but she still 
has to pay her taxes.

<p>

She works at a company as maybe a temp, and the 
chief executive officer has this incredibly generous health 
insurance policy.  The reason for that is that the only way 
you can get a generous tax break for health insurance is if 
your employer buys the policy for you.  And so you wind up 
with this incredible, incredible distortion at the center of 
our health care system that costs $100 billion a year in tax 
benefits, in which the chief executive of a company can get 
all of his medical bills paid, absolutely everything, 
probably time at a spa, mountain climbing, all part of a 
health plan.

<p>

And here is this woman who is paying her taxes and 
working as hard as she possibly can.  She doesn't have 
health insurance.  The only way that she can get health 
insurance is to either go on welfare so she can get Medicaid 
or to try to get a job that pays generous enough benefits so 
she can get health insurance.

<p>

That is a terrible problem, where you have this 
woman paying taxes to subsidize health insurance for the 
chief executive officer so he can have this generous health 
benefit plan.  That is the kind of invisible problem in the 
current system that, if women knew about that, they would be 
outraged.

<p>

On taxes, we did a little chart here -- I should 
have brought it as an overhead to show you -- that shows 
that the average family pays more in taxes than it spends 
for food, shelter, transportation, and clothing combined.  
If you visualize a bar chart in which state and local taxes 
are a higher line than those four other things -- food, 
clothing, shelter/housing, and transportation combined -- 
people don't understand that, because they see the paycheck 
that they get, and they don't understand the reason you're 
having to work a second job, the reason you're having to be 
in the work place instead of being home where you want to 
be, raising your children, as eight of ten women say they 
want to do, is because you have to pay all these taxes.

<p>

Government security, the security that you say you 
want from government, is the very reason that your life is 
being so disrupted by a government that is seeping in in its 
power and authority to either take away the resources and 
the authority that you have or to pretend to give you 
something on one hand but to take two handfuls out on the 
other side.

<p>

That kind of education, I believe, as conservative 
women, we have a responsibility to help other people 
understand that government security and compassion and the 
sense of being in control of your own life is not something 
that can come from Washington.

<p>

<center>* * * * * * * *</center>

<p>

MS. SILBERMAN: I believe that conservatives are 
somewhat tone-deaf in the way that they relate to American 
women and the American people.

<p>

I don't know whether you all have noticed, as I 
have, in the last few weeks, there have been pundits on all 
sides of the ideological spectrum (who) having been talking 
about the "feminization of American politics" in relation to 
the gender gap.

<p>

I am absolutely fascinated by this, and I think it 
behooves conservatives to spend some time figuring out the 
whys and wherefores of this phenomenon, because it 
absolutely is a phenomenon.

<p>

At first blush, I think, to speak of the 
feminization of American politics is counterintuitive to the 
principles which many of my friends take as an article of 
faith, and that is that one's gender should not dictate 
one's ideology and that having a uterus does not 
automatically mean that you are a liberal.

<p>

It seems to me that the gender gap's inescapable 
concomitant is the feminization of American political 
discourse, and I have come to believe that both the gender 
gap and the feminization of our politics have resulted from 
the fact that conservatives are tone-deaf, and that 
everything that people hear in the media and from our 
culture really reflects the resonance of the liberal point 
of view, because conservatives just don't know how to talk 
to people.

<p>

[Segments concluded.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When we return, we'll talk to those 
in the fight against pornography, as <i>Straight Talk</i> observes 
Pornography Awareness Week.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. For more than a decade, the 
American Family Association has declared Pornography 
Awareness Week.  To help us understand why this week is so 
crucial, I am joined by two of those who have worked 
together in the battle against the multi-million-dollar 
pornography industry.  I would like to welcome Dee Jepsen, 
president of Enough is Enough, and Cathy Cleaver, the Family 
Research Council's director of legal policy.  Welcome to the 
show.

<p>

You all have been working on this issue for a long 
time, and why is that?  I think a lot of people think, well, 
I've seen some naked pictures and it hasn't really had an 
effect on me.  Why do we even need to be concerned about 
pornography?

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Well, first of all, the material that 
we are talking about is illegal material, and it has a very 
harmful effect upon society in general, and specifically, we 
have a great concern for children.

<p>

Today, with the availability of this material via 
the Internet, through the computers that kids are more 
literate at than most adults, it is a very big problem and 
getting bigger.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: We have so many ways in which we 
have seen pornography devastate communities and 
relationships. Sometimes we talk about the victims of 
pornography, and they, of course, include women and 
children, but not just women and children.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's right.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: Men also are very manipulated by 
pornography, and some don't realize it until they find that 
they have a compulsion to consume it.  So it really has no 
beneficial effect in our society, and we ought to keep 
working to try to push it away from the mainstream and into 
the fringes.

<p>

We have to tolerate some of it, some marginal 
amount, because of our free speech jurisprudence, but we 
don't have to tolerate it in front of our kids and we don't 
have to tolerate it in front of non-consenting adults.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Go ahead, Dee.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: It is ironic, too, Kristi, that some 
people in our society feel, men feel they should have the 
freedom to have this material.  The irony is that once they 
get addicted to it, which happens quite easily, they are no 
longer in control of that desire to see that material; it is 
in control of them. And we see all kinds of devastation, as 
Cathy mentioned, within family structures, and it becomes 
the hard copy, if you will, of what is playing in the 
theater of their minds, and what you see and what you hear 
does affect how you act.  I mean, that is what education is 
all about.  That is why we have multi-millions and, I am 
sure, billions of dollars spent on advertising in this 
country, to affect action.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The scope of pornography -- and 
let's just define it for a second about some of the kinds of 
pornography you are most concerned about -- I mean, a lot of 
people, they think pornography, they think <i>Playboy</i> magazine,
and I am not sure that they are really aware of the kinds of 
material that is available and that there is pornography 
that is actually illegal, because free speech seems to be a 
get-out-of-jail-free card, you know, in our society. It's a 
speech issue, so we can't stop anything.

<p>

But, Cathy, you are a lawyer.  How do the courts 
define what is illegal pornography?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: Well, the word "pornography" is not 
a legal term.  Pornography refers to any representation that 
is designed to arouse the viewer.  But then we move beyond 
the general definition into the legal terms.  There is a 
term called "obscenity," and what that doesn't mean -- 
people think that means foul speech.  It can include foul 
speech, but what obscenity is is the hard-core pornography 
that the Supreme Court says deserves no legal protection.  
The First Amendment does not protect obscenity or hard-core 
pornography.  Adults can't trade in it; they certainly can't 
give it to kids; they can't export it or import it; you 
can't sell it or buy it.

<p>

So obscenity, hard-core pornography, and that 
would be the XXX type of material or worse, simply is not a 
legal commodity.  It's like drugs:  it's illegal.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It's like bestiality, torture -- 

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Mutilation. Child pornography, of 
course, is a form of it, but all kinds of really bizarre 
behavior involving numerous men, women, animals.  It is 
beyond description.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: It is the deviant -- things people 
that aren't into this wouldn't even imagine.  It is beyond 
the imagination.  But then you look at the category of 
things, examples of which might be <i>Playboy</i> and <i>Penthouse</i>.
Those types of things have been deemed by the courts -- we 
don't always agree with this -- as being legal for adults 
but illegal for kids, and that would be legal pornography.
It is not obscene, but it can be characterized certainly as 
pornography.  And those things, we are allowed as citizens 
to enact laws or to encourage our legislators to enact laws 
to restrict the sale of these things, but we cannot prevent 
adults completely from getting them.  So that would be the 
second category of pornography.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Dee, you had a long and prestigious 
career before you came to Enough is Enough, which truly 
focuses on the hardest kind of pornography.  But what is the 
scope of pornography?  This is Pornography Awareness Week.
How many lives are touched by it?  How much money is 
involved?

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Well, we have always said, in recent 
years it is an $8 billion to $10 billion a year industry.
With the advent of the computer and the Internet as the new 
delivery system, I imagine those figures now have changed 
quite a bit. It is hard to measure. But the effect that it 
has had in human life is beyond measurement.  You know, we 
get letters, and we look into the faces and the hearts of 
people every day in one way or another that have been harmed 
by it.

<p>

Children who were molested, and one of the major 
tools in that molestation was pornography, will have a pain, 
a hurt in their heart that, even if they go through 
counseling and healing, there will always be a scar from it 
all their life. Ofttimes people that molest children were 
molested as children, not always certainly, but that is a 
factor.  Sometimes people turn to self-abuse because of 
misplaced guilt or low self-esteem.

<p>

It has a huge effect upon society, and I think it 
is even bigger than that, because it is a devaluation of 
human life, and there is no respect because there is no love 
involved.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I have certainly read in some of the 
literature on pornography that it encourages -- you know, if 
men see women as objects and they need these kinds of 
devices to become aroused, I mean, eventually, you can't 
have a healthy relationship if you can't see women as 
anything other than something that is a tool.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That is right.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: That is interesting.  Just this 
year, a psychiatrist named Dr. Gary Brooks has come out with 
a book that I would recommend called <i>The Centerfold
Syndrome</i>. It talks about how society is perpetuating and 
helping perpetuate the myth of the centerfold as the ideal 
woman, and all other women as being inadequate.  And men are 
manipulated by this, the result of which is inability to 
have intimacy with real women.

<p>

It is a fascinating book.  He is by no means any 
sort of conservative or religious leader.  He is a 
psychiatrist who has counseled men for many years about 
their issues of masculinity, and he has come out with this, 
and many people are angry with him.  The ACLU and others 
think he is a fraud.  But some feminist groups are taking 
note and saying, yes, that is what we have been trying to 
say all along.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Well, you know, every feminist, every 
religious, every non-religious, every moderate, every 
conservative, every liberal woman in this country ought to 
agree on this issue, and caring men should, also.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And I think they do.

<p>

We are going to want to hear more about this and 
what happens with children when we come back. When <i>Straight 
Talk</i> returns, we are going to bring you more about the fight 
to protect our children from hard-core pornography.  Stay 
tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>, where we are joining with the 
American Family Association in recognizing Pornography 
Awareness Week.  With me to discuss the need for such a week 
is Dee Jepsen, president of Enough is Enough, and Cathy 
Cleaver, the Family Research Council's director of legal 
policy.  Welcome back.

<p>

We were talking a little bit earlier about the 
effect that pornography has had on men, but pornography, 
Dee, has it not had an effect on crime?

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Yes, it really has, and Cathy can 
probably cite some studies about how it has affected areas 
where there is pornography available, sexually oriented 
businesses exist.  But it encourages rape, because a lot of 
this material is showing women being portrayed as being 
overpowered by men and used sexually, and demeaned and 
degraded.

<p>

It also plays a very large role in the molestation 
of children.  It very often, in fact most often, is involved 
in child molestation.  They use it not only for their own 
incitement, but they use it to break down the inhibitions of 
the child, and they use it as an instruction manual to show 
the child what to do.  And then if they photograph or film 
that molestation, producing child pornography therefore, 
they will often use it to blackmail the child into silence.

<p>

So it plays a huge role in that, and it has an 
economic effect upon communities, as well, where this is 
available.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: There are many ways in which the 
impact of pornography has been studied, and you don't 
usually hear a lot about this because there are forces out 
there -- free speech rights, absolutists -- that don't want 
people to really know this, and that is, where there is a 
high consumption of pornography, there is a correlative high 
incidence of rape and sexual attack.  There just simply is.

<p>

Oklahoma City was studied over a four-year period 
in the mid-eighties, and over 130 porn and sex businesses 
were run out of the city, and the rape rate dropped 50 
percent as it was rising in surrounding cities.  There was a 
direct correlation to the amount of pornography that was 
available and that was being consumed by the people of that 
area.

<p>

There are studies upon studies of community values 
and community worth and how housing and businesses and the 
value of that property diminishes immediately as soon as 
porn businesses move in en masse to an area.  You might 
think this is common sense, but it is also good business 
sense.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's right.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: There are many ways to approach 
fighting pornography.  There are spiritual, moral, but also 
business and just simple common-sense ways.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, the use of pornography in 
sex crimes, I think, has been really illustrated by the 
National Center on Missing and Exploited Children, which we 
have had on the show before, but just talking about how they 
use that pornography in the same way that men become 
addicted.  You become stimulated, and then you need to 
escalate the kinds of materials -- 

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's right. It's an addictive process.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is, and a desensitization to the violence of it, and 
then in acting out.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There was some legislation recently, 
Cathy.  It didn't work, but it was interesting, to attempt 
to deal with the fact that pornography is used to act out 
sex crimes in a pattern of use.  Could you tell us about 
that?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: Sure. A few years ago, we were all 
fighting for the Pornography Victims Compensation Act.  What 
that would have provided would be a tool for people, 
individuals who are harmed by pornography because of either 
an attack or some other personal violence, allowing that 
individual to attempt to prove that this pornography played 
a significant factor in their harm.  That law failed, but I 
wouldn't be surprised if we see that coming up again, 
because it makes a lot of sense.

<p>

When there is a direct business injury because of 
an unreasonable and careless business operation, you can 
recover business damages.  But there is no personal damage 
recovery right now from the ill effects of pornography.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes.  What I found so interesting 
about that case was it was a case where a gentleman had a 
video, that he would kidnap a woman -- 

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: And imitate the video.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: -- and imitate the video, actually 
play and stop the video and do that thing to the woman, and 
did this repeatedly.  It was very clear that he was acting 
out that specific video.  And they were not able to do 
anything to the company that had sold him a blueprint for 
murder.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's really what it is, and people 
may not have accepted this idea at the time, but I do think, 
over a period of time -- it takes a while for the public to 
become educated to something.  You think about what has 
happened in a generation as far as smoking is concerned, 
about drinking and driving.  It took 10 or 11 years for 
MADD, Mothers Against Drunk Drivers, to bring about a public 
change of heart, a mind-set.

<p>

You have to focus on the problem, and most of 
America hasn't done that because it's not a pleasant topic. 
It is very distasteful, especially as women, to work in 
this area.  But if we don't do it, our children and 
grandchildren will suffer because we haven't.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right. I know that you all are both 
really concerned because of the Internet and its effect on 
children.  I mean, as easy or difficult as pornography may 
have been to get before, now you can type in a word, a 
single word, like "sex" or "zoo," and get all kinds of 
horrible bestiality or any kind of molestation information 
coming up.

<p>

I was really disturbed to learn recently that 
there are some words on the Internet which are common, like 
"recipe" or the most common words that someone might type 
in, that pornographers have been putting those common words 
on their screens just to bring up the pornography, even if 
their screen has nothing to do with it.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: If Clinton really does have the 
Internet in every school in America, what are you all going 
to be concerned about?

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Well, we are very, very concerned.
In fact, Enough is Enough has revised its whole strategic 
plan to focus at this point in time on making the Internet 
safe for children.  That is a huge job, but it is a growing 
technology, and with, as you say, every child being able to 
have access to a computer by the year 2000, which is four 
years away, every parent and grandparent and teacher in this 
country ought to be concerned, and we ought to be doing 
everything we can to address that.

<p>

We feel, frankly, that it is going to take a 
multifaceted approached.  We need tough legislation with 
aggressive law enforcement.  We need an educated public, 
especially parents.  We need a technology industry that 
becomes family-friendly, and I think that is not only a 
civic responsibility, but I think it is a good marketing 
approach, and I think we are going to see more of that as 
time goes by.

<p>

We will need an international coordinated effort 
as time goes by, also, because it is an enormous problem.
It is not just in the United States where there is concern; 
it is growing around the world.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, Cathy, I know you and I 
have talked about this on occasion, but there has been a sad 
increase in molestation and rapes of children, of younger 
children, 8-year-olds molesting 4-year-olds and 7-year-olds 
and infants.  I mean, we are really seeing little children 
with not a -- and what has been interesting in some of the 
cases is their arguing that the children did not have 
criminal intent because they didn't understand, although 
they did act out a sexual molestation of a younger child.
Is it accurate to say that pornography on very young 
children has even a stronger effect than on adults?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: Well, it can.  It can absolutely 
have a stronger effect, and I think that what this 
highlights is how many liberal activists like to experiment, 
frankly, with our children, experiment with their new 
agenda.

<p>

The American Library Association, for instance, as 
a matter of policy, says it will never use screening 
mechanisms on computers in libraries, even when a child as 
young as 10 years old or younger sits down at that computer.

<p>

In my opinion, that is a reckless disregard for 
children, and that is really experimenting with their lives. 
And then when we see these cases, we can see how truly 
devastating this can be for children.

<p>

There are many other ways in which we sort of 
experiment with children with pornography.  It is absolutely 
dehumanizing.  In the recent case on computer pornography, 
we saw ACLU experts come up on the stand and say, "I show my 
5-year-old hard-core pornography."  This is supposed to be 
some sort of psychologist, sexologist, or something.  And he 
was applauded, and he was one of their star witnesses.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is amazing.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Yes, it sure is.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: Now, this is just completely 
unhuman, and we seem to have checked out our common sense at 
the door on some of these issues with kids.

<p>

But pornography can completely ruin a child's 
impression of the world, himself, his body, other people, 
and it's like a poison, and we've got to be careful not to 
feed kids.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We're going to have to hear more 
about this in a moment.  Following this commercial break, 
we'll continue our discussion, and we hope you'll stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Joining me tonight to talk 
about Pornography Awareness Week is Dee Jepsen, president of 
the Enough is Enough Campaign, and Cathy Cleaver, the Family 
Research Council's director of legal policy.  Welcome back 
again to our show.

<p>

You know, one thing that really struck me about 
the pornography discussions, we have all agreed, on a whole, 
in a society that some information is not appropriate for 
children.  You know, we no more give children guns, even 
though guns are legal in certain settings, or medicines, 
even though certain narcotics are legal in certain settings, 
than we give them pornography.  You can't sell it over a 
counter, or in a video store they couldn't check it out.

<p>

But on the Internet, I was shocked to learn 
recently that it is legal to e-mail a child the most graphic 
obscenity, and there is no law to stop it; that somehow on 
the computer world the law is void or suspended or 
something.  How do we explain that?

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: It is a very difficult thing to deal 
with, and Cathy might talk about some of the legal 
intricacies of it.  But we have had some victories in recent 
days. We were able to see the Communications Decency Act 
passed.  It is now being challenged in the courts and will 
be going to the Supreme Court.  Cathy probably knows more 
about that than I.  And we also saw a bill pass that made 
computer-generated child pornography illegal, just like 
child pornography per se is illegal.

<p>

Today, you look at modern movies and you see how 
that which you know is not real becomes real before your 
eyes, and they can do that on the computers, and that 
material is still used in the same way that other child 
pornography is used by pedophiles.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So, basically, although we know 
there were no dinosaurs in Jurassic Park, they could create 
them.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Exactly.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So if you created children for 
obscene pictures, that also would be illegal.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's right. That's right, and this 
material now being available by computer makes every home 
and school and library, every place there is a computer 
outlet hooked to the Internet, a site of delivery or 
distribution for pornography.  That is an appalling 
situation.

<p>

Cathy mentioned earlier about those within the 
library community that do not want to have any kind of 
filter system so children cannot -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And that's our taxpayer-funded 
libraries, too.  I mean, let's be clear.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  That's right.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: But some of these very same people 
would be so supportive of trying to create a risk-free 
environment in the area of toys and everything else that 
children are involved with, and they want quality control on 
everything, and I am not knocking that at all.  All I am 
saying is, this is what we are pouring into children's 
minds, and somewhere logic has become convoluted in that 
whole argument.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: We really treat both pornography, 
which we have been struggling with, and now the Internet 
with kid gloves, I think.  In the next few months we are 
going to be seeing at the Supreme Court the ACLU and other 
pornography magazine distributors, their challenge against 
this computer pornography law.  So there are many anti-pornography 
groups -- Enough is Enough, Family Research 
Council, and others -- who are trying to defend this law 
because it makes sense.

<p>

Guccione, the publisher of <i>Penthouse</i>, is now 
filing suit, we understand, against the military anti-pornography 
law, which says that we ought not sell pornography on our military bases.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: At a discounted rate.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: At a discount to our servicemen, yes.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: So that makes sense.  The law makes 
sense.  The challenge doesn't make any sense.  But it's a 
constant battle.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's where he makes his money.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: That's where he makes his money, so 
it makes sense to him.  There is a battle in our courts 
always, and there is a really a battle for the hearts and 
minds of the people of our society.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, here is an interesting 
counter to that.  Let's look at what has happened in 
television.  You have the President for the V-chip, 
assuming, of course, that the government decides what should 
be blocked as violence.  And you've got all of these so-called 
child advocates favoring pornography and pornography 
distribution, but on the other hand saying we must mandate 
more educational television, and we must govern advertising 
on television for its impact on children; we have to be 
harsher on cigarette and alcohol ads, so that even the 
presence of Joe Camel on a race car is anti-child.

<p>

And these same people who seem to think that Joe 
Camel on a race car will drive children to smoking don't 
think that killing people in a slasher film will have any 
effect on them at all.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That is a great example.  That is 
exactly right.  It makes no sense whatsoever.  But I really 
believe, if we talk about it long enough, that the American 
public are finally going to have the light bulb go on, and 
they are going to say, "Wait a minute.  There's something 
wrong here, and we're going to have to do something about 
it."

<p>

You know, homes and libraries and schools across 
this country should be at least installing blocking 
technology, and now there is new technology that can be 
installed, second generation, at the server level.  And we 
are going to be doing everything we can to get that done.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We just have a couple minutes left. 
Tell us how people could find out about that.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: Well, one thing they could do is 
contact our office.  That telephone number is 703-278-8343, 
and we could get material to them.  We would be happy to do 
that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There is a little bit of technology. 
I know Cathy has been concerned about how thorough it can 
be, but it would be something.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That is right.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: It should be done.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: It's a beginning.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: It's a beginning. Many parents have 
decided simply not to have the Internet in their homes if 
they have children.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: We hear it all the time.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: And if I had children, right now, I 
don't think I would have the Internet in my home.  The 
software blocking mechanisms are very inadequate, and it 
only takes one picture to really assault a child.

<p>

MS. JEPSEN: That's right.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: And so you might want to consider 
that if you are a parent now with kids, just not bringing 
the Internet in your home until it gets better, until these 
laws start to be enforced.  But at all costs, you ought to 
employ, find out which software blocking program is 
esteemed.  Enough is Enough has some ideas about which ones 
are good programs, and they are a good resource for parents.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to have people 
call us for that information.

<p>

I would like to thank both of you, and this is not 
over.  I know the court case is going to come up the first 
of the year, and we are going to want to hear back.

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will present 
another aspect of how this year's campaigns address women 
and the so-called women's issues.  Stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>.

<p>

I was fortunate to join the discussion at The 
Heritage Foundation, which you caught a glimpse of earlier 
in the show. These panels showed that there really are no 
kneejerk women's positions, although two issues, education 
and the life issue, are usually played as if there are.
Let's see how those issues unfold as <i>Straight Talk</i> presents 
some Homefront News.

<p>

<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">

<p>

[Segment from The Heritage Foundation Conference 
entitled "Women, Politics, and the 1996 Elections," held 
September 27, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I want to just put forward that 
there are two issues that I am going to address that I think 
are fundamental to our natures as women.  Harkening back to 
this obsession with feminine hygiene, I think there is 
something true about women's fundamental physical nature 
that makes you very practical about your children and about 
not just the children that you have but that you could have 
or that other women are having, that we are regularly 
reminded that we are not alone in the world, that we have a 
generation to think about before us and that we come from 
something, and I think it makes women, in particular, very 
practical.

<p>

There are two issues that I wanted to address that 
I think are fundamental issues for their importance to 
women, although I don't want to box them in as women's 
issues, but also the problem with them, from my perspective, 
and that launched me on a heated diatribe with Karen, was 
the way in which they are discussed.

<p>

Those issues that I think are very interesting to 
women are education and life.  And again, because of their 
fundamental connection to our interest in children and to 
our interest in our society's longevity, it is a long-term-thinking 
approach.  Both education and the life issue 
connect us to the future.  Both of them say that we are 
going to be building something and we are concerned about 
it.

<p>

But what irritates me about these two issues is 
that they are described in such kneejerk fashion, and I 
didn't get a chance to ask this question, but I think that 
women, in particular, have to be a little more irritated 
with the way in which the debate goes, because its competing 
slogan -- education, tax thing, you know, education, 
program, education this, education that -- as though somehow 
we are too unintelligent, A, to make our own decisions, B, 
to understand a greater context of the debate.

<p>

And so on the issue of education in general, at 
Family Research Council, I will tell you right up front, we 
think that people are smart enough to choose schools that 
have opportunity, and to take tax dollars and set them up as 
a sacred cow in a school system in which you have no input, 
in which groups like the People for the American Way or the 
American Library Association will label your calling the 
school an act of censorship, not because anything happened 
but because a parent accidentally got involved in the 
process, that somehow this is an offense to the educational 
system because you had a thought about your child's 
education.

<p>

And so what we have tried to do in terms of the 
education debate is say, look, people are intelligent.  They 
can make intelligent decisions, and the education debate is 
so jargon-full and practicality-absent.

<p>

And so what I wanted to say to the Dole campaign, 
if they were listening, is it's not to talk about education 
but to talk about it specifically and with compassion, 
because I don't think that Bill Clinton wins in the 
specifics, but I think sometimes he wins in the compassion, 
that as women we are very concerned about what happens to 
our children, and sometimes the green-eyeshade approach, 
which is a Republican-heavy approach, doesn't cut it for us.

<p>

I am not per se -- I can tell you for myself, if 
the money that my husband and I paid out in tax dollars was 
effective, I probably would be thrown out of the Republican 
Party for saying, "Well, sure, it's a lot, but, you know, 
they're doing something."

<p>

But the problem with a lot of people is they're 
taking a lot of my money and doing nothing.  They're doing 
nothing.  It is not just that my money disappears but that 
it ineffectively disappears.

<p>

I have been working for the end of the Department 
of Education for a long time, and I want to tell you why.
Seven cents out of every dollar spent in the local school 
comes from the Federal Government, but the majority of the 
mandates for education come from the Federal Government.  So 
for a toehold of dollars, we get a barrelful of policies, 
and none of them to our liking.

<p>

We have 150 education programs; 16,200 employees 
here in Washington, D.C.; a budget of more than $3 billion, 
bigger than five other departments, and for that we get 
nothing.  We get nothing.  And what I am arguing is that 
education might be a fundamental interest to us, but if you 
don't explain why what you are doing will help people do 
better, it is insignificant if it is less expensive, and 
that that is a problem with the education debate today.

<p>

In the same token, I am unimpressed with Bill 
Clinton's, "How about $1,500 for a trade school of any 
kind?"  Well, what if I didn't want to do that?  What if I 
had different goals for my money?  Why should Bill Clinton 
dictate for me where I spend my education goals, because 
then the government still is making choices for me.

<p>

The way that we have to talk about education 
today, though, has to be both pragmatic and specific and 
compassionate.  We cannot merely be cutting the dollars.  We 
have to be talking about where they're going to go.

<p>

I, for one, am a gigantic advocate of school 
choice, and you are always seeing people say, "Oh, you're 
going to get people out the process.  They are not going to 
get involved."  We have had several very successful school 
choice programs in the United States that didn't violate 
anyone's wall between church and state.  The first one was 
the GI bill, which educated a generation successfully and 
gave them money to go to the school of their choice, and the 
entire nation prospered.

<p>

The second one had to do with Pell grants and 
other educational grants that went to people to go to the 
school of their choice, and again, a tremendous success from 
choice.

<p>

In the same way -- let's not argue about the 
details today, because maybe we wouldn't all agree -- but 
can we not agree that people can make better choices and 
that it is not just the money but it is the way in which it 
is spent?

<p>

So I am a little annoyed sometimes by everyone 
trying to poke my woman button by mentioning education but 
not taking the time to explain how your program works, 
number one, and whether it is even a better use of my money 
than a couple of ideas that I have, frankly.  And so we have 
to start talking about education issues in a compassionate way.

<p>

And I go to the life issue again.  The research is 
clear, and I can go through the numbers but I will skip 
that, that women are pro-life (more) than men.  Again, I 
think it is a fundamental thing, that we understand 
something about what is happening on that area.  But again, 
I am painted as a caricature of myself in the public debate, 
and I reject it.

<p>

Partial birth, yesterday, I think, a very sad vote 
in which viable, healthy children can be stabbed in the base 
of the skull in the name of choice.  Even if a person is for 
abortion, is there no line that goes too far?  Is this the 
oozy of the NRA, frankly?

<p>

But let me take a look at a different abortion 
issue from the standpoint of a woman, and that is RU-486.
Let's say that you really think there should be abortion 
somewhere along the line.  So let's just say, yeah, we want 
abortions to be safe, legal, and rare, but certainly safe.
So we see the Clinton Administration lobbying for RU-486,
which is a chemical abortifacient.

<p>

This morning on NPR I awoke to the very 
fascinating and meaningless knowledge that, in the 1960s, 
Procter and Gamble developed Olestra, which is a pretend fat 
substitute that they will now use to make potato chips, and 
the consumer groups are going to go to court to stop it 
because it might not be healthy, despite the fact that they 
have been testing it for 30 years.

<p>

And in a six-month test on RU-486 in which we 
don't understand its impact on women's long-term fertility, 
whether these drugs originally designed for cancer and for 
ulcers might build up and be a toxin in your system, whether 
there is any impact on your ability to have future children 
-- we don't know any of this, but you know, because it is 
abortion and it's a "woman's issue," we are going to force 
it through and we're going to have abortion, thank God, with 
this chemical.

<p>

I just want to encourage us in our discussion as 
women of the life issue and of the education issues to put 
our practical and our nature-oriented issues to bear and to 
ask harder questions of people.  I think these two issues 
are powerful as long as we discuss them pragmatically and 
compassionately.

<title> Tax Limitation Amendment</title>

<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">

<h2><i>Tax Limitation</i></h2> <br>		             
</center>

Although April 15th is always an important day in the Unites States, this year, this day will earmark a hopeful turn of events.  The Tax Limitation Amendment, one of the first reform acts of the 104th Congress, will go to the House floor on April 15th.  Sponsored by over 166 Representatives, this amendment would require Congress to have a two-thirds majority vote in each house to approve tax-rate increases. <p> 

Senator Kyl (R-AZ) is the driving force behind the amendment for the Senate.  Senator Kyl has proposed that if this bill passes it would need ratification by 38 states in order to become the 28th amendment to the U.S. Constitution. <p>

One of the key factors to passing this bill would not only make it harder for Congress to raise taxes, but would force lawmakers to prioritize government spending.  The bill was written to encourage the elimination of lower priority programs to pay for new proposals as opposed to seeking finances through raised taxes. <p>

Recent surveys and studies have shown that the majority of American voters support the Tax Limitation Amendment.  The bill has also received tremendous backing from many high profile organizations, such as the American Conservative Union, the Christian Coalition, Citizens Against Government Waste, Family Research Council, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. <p>

Below is a layout of the proposed bill and some of the key reasons why it would stabilize tax laws: <p>

 <p> <br> <br> <br> 
					
					<center>April 15 Floor Vote </center> <p>

Section 1.<p>
	Any bill to increase taxes by increasing the rate or base of any tax may pass only by a two-thirds majority of the whole number of each House of Congress. <p>

Section 2.<p>
	Waiver during periods of declared war or imminent and serious threat to national security declared by a joint resolution.  Any provision which passed subject to the waiver shall last no more than 2 years. <p>

Section 3.<p>
	All votes will be roll call votes. <p>

<p> <br>  <br> 

				 <center>	Talking Points </center> <p>
<ul>
<li>The Kemp Commission on Tax Reform endorsed a 2/3rds super-majority requirement for tax increases. It is an essential part of any tax reform.<p>

<li> One-third of all Americans live in a state with tax limitation in their constitutions: Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and South Dakota.  Other states are pursuing similar measures. <p>

<li> In the last decade, taxes in non-super-majority states went up 104%.  In super-majority requirement states, tax revenues went up only 87%. <p>

<li> In the last decade, spending in non-super-majority states went up 102%.  In states with the super-majority protection, spending increased only 95%. <p>

<li> It must be more difficult for future Congresses to raise taxes. Because federal benefits tend to be targeted at specific groups, special interest groups consistently come together to effectively lobby for more spending.  Taxes, on the other hand are spread among many millions of people who would find it difficult to band together as an interest group. The built-in pressure in a democracy is toward more spending.  The super-majority provision successfully balances the pressure. <p>

<li> Four of the last five major tax increases were passed with less than a two-thirds super-majority.  Those taxes added an additional $666 billion to the tax bill for the American taxpayer. <p>

<li> On Day One of the 104th Congress, the House voted 279-152 for a super-majority requirement to raise income taxes -- 11 votes shy of two-thirds.  This important protection, though, only applies during the 104th Congress, and only to the House. <p>

<H1>The brutal assault on a good reputation</H1></CENTER>

<P>There's an axiom of Arkansas politics that it takes two generations for a family to get back its reputation after someone in the family gets himself elected governor.

<P>Poor Arkansas. The state may never regain its reputation for square dealing and straight shooting - which is actually how most of its sons and daughters, among the most honorable and decent people on earth, deal with one another.

<P>The stereotype of the barefoot hillbilly, with his jug of corn whiskey slung over one shoulder and his long rifle (with which he could put out the eye of a panther at a hundred yards) over the other, has been succeeded by the stereotype of the country lawyer/banker/chickenplucker who could and would pick his neighbor's pocket at a hundred feet.

<P>Many Arkansawyers will tell you, almost tearfully, that if Bill Clinton's reckless personal behavior and irresponsible abuse of the facts has embarrassed the nation, he has humiliated his home state. Hillary has done her part, too, though she gets an asterisk beside her name because she's from Illinois, not Arkansas.

<P>Only last week, Beverly Bassett Schaffer, the one-time Arkansas securities commissioner who Mrs. Clinton didn't remember talking to about the troubles Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan was having with the state, testified that well, yes, they did have a conversation and it lasted fully five minutes.

<P>Naturally nobody did anything wrong or said anything inappropriate. But we know enough now about how the first lady operates - &quot;there's hell to pay when she doesn't get her way&quot; - that we can guess how that conversation went. Mrs. Schaffer, who was then Miss Bassett, understood that Hillary was the wife of the governor - or &quot;Bill,&quot; as she referred to him in the correspondence telling an assistant to warn the governor that the feds were closing in on Madison S&amp;L -and she was in no position to do anything more than salute the wife. Madison, of course, was the reliable Clinton family piggy bank.

<P>If the rest of the country is getting a little weary of it all, we saw the strain begin to show on the Clintons and their entourage, and their paid pleaders, last week.

<P>Some of the dwindling band of Clinton acolytes among the reporters and commentators, yearning for one more invitation to sup at the White House, naturally went gaga over the president's tribute to the first lady before his State of the Union address at the Capitol. But not all. One of the exceptions, Mark Shields, the PBS commentator, observed that the salute to Hillary was a tribute that the president owed the first lady because she had swallowed hard and stuck by him at the first insinuations that his character was not all that it should be. Now that insinuations have been made against Mrs. Clinton's moral and ethical reputation, payback is only fair.

<P>You didn't have to be Sigmund Freud to detect and understand that icy stare that Mrs. Clinton shot back at her husband after he paid tribute to her as &quot;a wonderful wife, a magnificent mother and a great first lady.&quot;

<P>But unless Mrs. Clinton is unique as an American wife, a woman merely amused by the tales of her husband's heroic sexual adventuring, cutting a swath a mile wide through their friends and employees, she is particularly annoyed now when the tsunami of ethical and moral questions rolls toward the White House and it is she, and not he, who may be asked to drown and to be cheerful about it. She's entitled to wake up at 3 o'clock in the morning to wonder why the faithful wife must sacrifice herself to protect the pact made 25 years ago at Yale Law School to experiment on a guinea pig called Arkansas en route to important things in Washington.

<P>How galling now that she, who has taken such pride over the years in her part in the destruction of Richard Nixon, punishing him for covering up a third-rate political burglary, should now see similar punishment looming for covering up a third-rate bank robbery in a place no longer of any consequence to the Clintons.

<P>The White House, and Democrats generally, get red in the face at comparisons of Whitewater (or &quot;Wifewater,&quot; as the Economist calls it) to the Watergate scandals of nearly a quarter of a century ago. Such comparisons sting because they are so exquisitely apt. Al Hunt of the Wall Street Journal, perhaps the most faithful of all the Clinton liege men, sneers that comparing Whitewater to Watergate, the Clintons to Nixon, is &quot;like comparing a jaywalker to the Boston Strangler.&quot;

<P>Then Mr. Hunt reaches for the analogy himself: Susan Thomases, he writes, has dispensed &quot;more bad advice to a White House than anyone since Chuck Colson.&quot; Mr. Colson, of course, was convicted of Watergate cover-up crimes. He repented and found forgiveness in the blood of Christ. Any Methodist in Arkansas could explain the difference.

</CENTER>

<p><center><b><font size=5>Reality check</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>We received an interesting invitation to a video conference in Washington honoring Women's History Month, titled &quot;Sexual Harassment 1996: Scholarly Definitions &amp; Everyday Realities.&quot;

<BR><DD>And wouldn't you know that Anita Faye Hill, who charged she was sexually harassed by Clarence Thomas, is the featured special guest panelist. The video conference will take place March 27 at the Biz Net Studios in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Building.

<BR><DD>We're told that Paula Corbin Jones, who has brought sexual harassment charges against President Clinton, will not be participating.

<p><center><b><font size=5>Kooks on kooks</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>Democrats are finding that the World Wide Web is an effective means for distributing news, information and even a political jab or two to a large audience.

<BR><DD>Taking a peek at one of the Democratic Policy Committee's well-designed Web pages - http:// www.randomhouse.com/site/ election96/carville/ - we find links to such items as the &quot;Ridiculous Republican of the Week,&quot; the &quot;Republican Hatchet Job of the Week,&quot; the &quot;Republican Myth of the Week&quot; and, last but not least, the &quot;Republican Kook of the Week.&quot;

<p><center><b><font size=5>Say anything</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>It's an election year, and President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore certainly aren't fooling anybody, but for the sake of the youth of our nation, that's OK with Sen. Orrin G. Hatch.

<BR><DD>&quot;President Clinton has let the country down because of his failure to lead on the drug issue,&quot; the Utah Republican said. &quot;We have gone from a 'just say no' program under President Reagan to pleading with President Clinton to just say something.

<BR><DD>&quot;If the president is finally beginning to speak out more because it is a political year - I know he just held a conference on some aspects of this problem - then I say it is better late than never. I commend him for it.&quot;

<p><center><b><font size=5>Bunning and the boys</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>Pitcher-turned-congressman Jim Bunning is one of four baseball greats elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. The Kentucky Republican, 64, won 224 games with the Detroit Tigers, the Philadelphia Phillies and the Pittsburgh Pirates over 17 seasons.

<BR><DD>Rep. Henry J. Hyde, Illinois Republican, got to deliver the news about the future Hall of Famer's election to the House.

<BR><DD>In doing so, he told the story of when Mr. Bunning was pitching against the New York Yankees, who had a first-base coach named Bob Turley, &quot;a former pitcher who was very skilled at stealing signs. Every time Jim would throw a fastball, Turley would whistle, and the batters knew what the pitch was,&quot; Mr. Hyde noted.

<BR><DD>&quot;Now, the first batter up was Bobby Richardson, and Jim got him out. The second batter up was Tony Kubek, the shortstop. Jim got him out. The third batter stepped in, Mickey Mantle, and Jim walked over to the first-base coach, Turley, and he said, 'If you whistle, I am going to hit him right in the back with a pitch.'

<BR><DD>&quot;Jim took the mound. He got his sign, and he was at the top of his windup when Turley whistled. Jim decided to cross everybody up. He threw a slider. It got away from him, and hit Mantle right in the back. Mantle headed toward the mound with his bat, but decided better of it, and trotted down to first base.

<BR><DD>&quot;The next batter was Yogi Berra. Yogi stepped in, pounded the plate, looked at Jim Bunning and said, 'Hey, Jim, if Turley whistles, I ain't listening.'&quot;

<p><center><b><font size=5>The Wright stuff</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>Democratic Rep. Claude Pepper, who was the oldest member of Congress when he died in 1989 at 88, was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 1937. A liberal, he was on Capitol Hill to fight for Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal and against Ronald Reagan's conservative revolution.

<BR><DD>Last week, Sen. Byron L. Dorgan, North Dakota Democrat, recalled the week he first set foot in Congress and walked into the office of Mr. Pepper, &quot;and I saw something I have not forgotten.&quot;

<BR><DD>On the wall behind Mr. Pepper's desk, the senator remembered, &quot;was an autographed picture of Orville and Wilbur Wright making the first airplane flight. And it was autographed, 'To Congressman Claude Pepper,' by Orville Wright. ...

<BR><DD>&quot;Then, hanging just above that, was a picture of Neil Armstrong setting his foot on the moon, autographed, 'To Congressman Claude Pepper.'&quot;

<p><center><b><font size=5>We got you, boys</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>A tremendous audience of 250 people showed up for a news conference recently at which the national retail sales tax was unveiled. The legislation would abolish the Internal Revenue Service, the federal income tax and inheritance taxes, replacing them with a retail sales tax of about 15 percent.

<BR><DD>Republican Reps. Billy Tauzin of Louisiana and Dan Schaefer of Colorado are co-sponsors of the legislation, although fellow Rep. Sonny Bono, California Republican, dropped by to see why the big audience.

<BR><DD>Introducing the former Hollywood entertainer, Mr. Tauzin noted: &quot;You know, when Sonny wrote the song 'I Got You, Babe,' it was really the theme song for the IRS.&quot;

<BR><DD>To which Mr. Bono quipped: &quot;Billy and Dan, you guys have got a lot of courage for sponsoring this legislation, because you know you're going to get audited!&quot;

<p><center><b><font size=5>Pork alert</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>We've just examined the 1996 Congressional Pig Book, released by Citizens Against Government Waste.

<BR><DD>&quot;Rolling out the pork barrel and having a barrel of fun has long been one of Washington's more unseemly traditions, and few indeed have shown the will to resist its temptations,&quot; notes the 600,000-member, nonpartisan organization in the introduction.

<BR><DD>First, the criteria for pork: requested by only one chamber of Congress; not specifically authorized; not competitively awarded; not requested by the president; greatly exceeds the president's budget request; not the subject of congressional hearings; and serves only a local or special interest.

<BR><DD>Second, a few examples of pork 1996-style, followed by CAGW reaction:

<UL>
<LI>$395,000 awarded in conference for rice modeling at the University of Arkansas and the University of Missouri. &quot;Uncle Ben, not Uncle Sam, should be funding this research.&quot;

<LI>$3.75 million by the Senate for wood-utilization research from Maine to Oregon. &quot;How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if he had $3.75 million?&quot;

<LI>$1 million by the Senate for outreach for socially disadvantaged farmers.

<LI>$1 million by the Senate for research on the brown tree snake. &quot;The Brown Tree Snake, which is found only in Guam, has not been discovered to be life-threatening to humans, nor does it have the ability to survive in North America.&quot;
</UL>
<p><center><b><font size=5>Real death</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>A government notice states: &quot;According to the National Center for Health Statistics, tobacco, diet and alcohol are the three leading causes of actual death in the U.S.&quot;

<p><center><b><font size=5>Talk about reporters</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>Carrie Klein, a former aide to Sen. Mark O. Hatfield, Oregon Republican, compiled the congressional index that appears in the 1996 Media Studies Journal, published by Columbia University. One portion notes:

<BR><DD>&quot;Number of journalists accredited to the Senate and House press galleries: 7,142.

<BR><DD>&quot;Ratio of journalists to congressmen: 16:1.

<BR><DD>&quot;Ratio of journalists to senators: 71:1.&quot;

<p><center><b><font size=5>Sweet dreams</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>Sen. Jesse Helms, North Carolina Republican, was on hand at the White House March 12 to witness President Clinton sign long-awaited legislation to tighten sanctions against Cuba.

<BR><DD>Emerging from the signing ceremony, Mr. Helms encountered a horde of reporters in the White House driveway, one of whom pointed out: &quot;You know, the Cuban government says repeatedly that this law is going to have no impact, that in reality the other governments are not going to pay attention to what it says, on the contrary it's illegal because it goes against NAFTA and GATT. What's your impression? Do you think -&quot;

<BR><DD>&quot;Well,&quot; interrupted Mr. Helms, &quot;will you deliver a message to the Cuban government for me?&quot;

<BR><DD>&quot;Well,&quot; replied the reporter, &quot;I can't -&quot;

<BR><DD>&quot;Dream on!&quot; Mr. Helms told the Cuban government.

<BR><DD>&quot;... but I'm sure they're hearing it,&quot; the reporter said.

<p><center><b><font size=5>Sea to shining sea</center></b></font>

<BR><DD>We've intercepted a memo from the U.S. Coast Guard commandant's office that says Transportation Secretary Federico Pena &quot;has requested that the department commemorate Earth Day, April 22, 1996, with a celebration that reaches across the country from headquarters to our field units.&quot;

<BR><DD>It continues: &quot;This is an ideal opportunity to recognize every individual's role and responsibility and to reinforce one of the Coast Guard's most important missions, 'Protecting Our Environment.' This year's theme is 'Reduce, Reuse and Recycle.'&quot;

<BR><DD>The memo directs all field units &quot;to plan and participate in Earth Day festivities either by conducting Earth Day observations at your units ... or by contributing to local community Earth Day celebrations.&quot;

<BR><DD>It also requests that each unit provide in advance to the commandant's office a list and description of planned Earth Day activities.

<BR><DD>The Earth Day tradition was launched in the United States in 1970, shortly after the Cuyahoga River caught fire.

<BR><FONT SIZE=7>Clinton seeks to please<BR>gays and moderates</FONT>
<HR WIDTH=50%>By Paul Bedard<BR><font size=1>
The Washington Times</font><HR WIDTH=30%></center>


<BR><DD>President Clinton is wooing homosexual voters and AIDS activists, who were angered by his handling of their issues earlier in his term, by making new promises to consider expanded civil rights - including same-sex &quot;marriages.&quot;

<BR><DD>Capitalizing on a top issue in the community, Marsha Scott, Mr. Clinton's liaison to homosexual activists, is seeking suggestions on what position the president should take on same-sex marriages.

<BR><DD>In Boston recently, Miss Scott told a homosexual group, &quot;We [need] to find ways to ensure that those of you in these loving, long-term and committed relationships can enjoy all the same benefits that [heterosexual couples] are entitled to under the law.&quot;

<BR><DD>She added that using same-sex marriages may not be the right &quot;vehicle&quot; now but said, &quot;I'm going to argue that we broaden the context and look at the rights that gays and lesbians have ... and where those rights are denied.&quot;

<BR><DD>Asked about Miss Scott's little-noticed statements, a senior administration official said homosexual marriage is &quot;not something we intend to espouse.&quot;

<BR><DD>The official said that the White House will leave it to states to decide the issue, and that Mr. Clinton wants to do &quot;everything we can to support&quot; traditional marriages between heterosexuals.

<BR><DD>But the aide added: &quot;The president is aware that many communities and institutions are considering whether certain basic benefits can be provided outside the context of traditional marriage. The challenge in addressing these issues is to remain sensitive to the traditional values of our communities while preserving the fundamental right to live free from unjustified discrimination.&quot;

<BR><DD>Mr. Clinton, said the official, is &quot;personally&quot; opposed to homosexual marriages.

<BR><DD>Opponents of Mr. Clinton, however, noted that he also &quot;objected&quot; to late-term partial-birth abortions but vetoed a ban on the procedure.

<BR><DD>Conservative and liberal critics of the president complained about the aide's comments, which they said were designed merely to solicit support for the president. Miss Scott did not return a reporter's phone call.

<BR><DD>Steve Michael, a third-party presidential candidate supported by ACT UP, the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, said &quot;they're making more empty promises.&quot;

<BR><DD>Robert Knight of the conservative Family Research Council said, &quot;The president is between a rock and a hard place, because he knows embracing same-sex marriage would alienate most voters who view him as a moderate.&quot;

<BR><DD>In an interview with Windows, New England's largest homosexual newspaper, Miss Scott said that in a Dole-Clinton race, &quot;I think you have extremely clear choices. You are either at the political table with a Clinton administration, or there is not even a door for you to get to the table.&quot;

<HR>
27-November-1995

<P>
RUSTY


<p>Sorry -- this is going to have to be a short one. I've been in the Oval Office with Bill, Mrs. William J. Clinton, Bob Rubin, and Dick Morris. We were talking strategy for the coming budget battle, and I'm waiting for the meeting to resume. For the first time in months, we're feeling confident and ready to go to war!

<p> Mrs. WJC and Dick Morris have put Bill on a pretty stringent diet -- high fiber, low fat. As you must know, Rusty, ever since my New York Times bestseller Earth in the Balance (for which, by the way, I was paid a moderate advance and had my contract vetted by the Senate Ethics Committee -- just so you know), they've been clamoring for another Al Gore manuscript. Just last week I finalized it. It's a compilation of all of the changes and streamlining that we've done since my revolutionary ``Re-Inventing Government'' proposals. Let me tell you, I sweated over those 43 pages. But in the end it was worth it -- I smell another hit! 
<p>
And Tipper had a cute idea: put a picture of Bill five months ago on the front cover -- you know, puffy-faced, red-nosed, cottony-eyed, kind of a ``government before the Gore plan'' photo; and on the back cover, put a photo of the leaner, trimmer Bill as a ``government after the Gore plan'' photo. So now we're in a bit of a holding pattern, waiting for the leaner and trimmer Bill to emerge. 
<p>
In this meeting, anyway, he's certainly holding his own. I recommended that we make no concessions, no compromises. He nodded in agreement.
<p>
``Absolutely,'' he said. ``I think there comes a time when we just say, 'Hey, there are some things that we believe in, some things we will absolutely not compromise on.'''
<p>
``Great!'' I said.Bill looked plaintively at Mrs. WJC. She nodded to Dick Morris. Dick reached into a pocket and removed a jumbo Snickers bar. Bill tore into it.
<p>
``Gosh,'' I said, ``that's a peculiar diet regimen.''
<p>
``Yeah, well . . .'' mumbled Bill, mouth full. He turned to Bob Rubin, the Secretary of the Treasury. ``I raised taxes too much, didn't I?'' he asked.
<p>
Bob was about to reply, when Dick Morris snatched away what remained of the Snickers bar. Mrs. WJC took out a short ruler, and with amazing speed snapped it down hard on Bill's hand.
<p>
``Ow!'' he cried.
<p>
``There's more where that came from,'' she said.
<p>
I just looked out the window, embarrassed. You know me, Rusty: I say, ``Let Clinton be Clinton.''
<p>
Bob Rubin leaned forward and spoke, almost in a whisper. ``Mr. President, do you really think you raised my taxes too much?''
<p>
Bill was silent for a moment. Bob opened up his case and took out a large McDonald's bag. ``Look, Mr. President. Look what I've got! A Big Mac -- '' Bob removed the plastic box -- I made a mental note to tell him that it will take our precious environment 15,000,000,000 years to digest the box that contains a hamburger that will take him only 15 minutes to digest -- and Bob began to eat the Big Mac. He reached into the bag and pulled out another one.
<p>
``Well, lookee here! Another Big Mac, all warm and gooey. Who will help me eat this, I wonder?''
<p>Bill answered in a tiny voice, ``I will.''
<p>
Mrs. WJC got into the act. ``But why should he give it to you? You raised his taxes too much.''
<p>
``No I didn't.''
<p>
``I CAN'T HEAR YOU!''
<p>
``No I didn't!''
<p>
Bob tossed Bill the second Big Mac. Paper rustled, lettuce flew, special sauce splattered -- the whole thing was gone in an eyeblink.
<p>
The intercom buzzed. ``Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich on conference call, Mr. President.''
<p>
Bill reached for the phone. Mrs. WJC waved her ruler. Dick Morris produced a large pepperoni pizza.
<p>
``Hello, Senator, Mr. Speaker,'' Bill said. ``I must tell you that I'm very disappointed in your budget bill. I think it declares war on the poor and underprivileged, it maintains a generous welfare for businesses and lobbyists, and I plan to veto it.''
<p>He paused for a moment, while Dole and Gingrich spoke. After a moment or two, Mrs. WJC put away her ruler, and Dick Morris put the pizza down on the credenza.
<p>
Bill cleared his throat. ``Actually, Newt,'' he said, ``I see your point. And Senator, in a way I agree with you, too. Maybe if we all sit down -- ''
<p>
Mrs. WJC yanked the phone from the wall. Dick Morris tossed the pizza aside and asked if Bob and I would excuse them. As we crept out, a few aides wheeled in a large caterer's steam table, laden with pies, ribs, butte red corn, and a suckling pig.
<p>
I never realized that letting Clinton be Clinton would be so fattening.

Dear Cleta:
<p>
As active Constitutionalists, we must find a way to force the major media to <br>tell the truth about losses of our freedoms under the Constitution. We know that <br>laws being forced upon us are in truth unlawful, yet media supports every <br>oppressive law they pass.  I have tried to get them to begin telling the <br>people the truth about internal enemies of our Republic...to no avail. <br>I then assume that the media is part of the conspiracy to destroy <br>American freedoms.
<p>
Any suggestions?  
<p>
-- Constitutionalist
</pre>
<p>
Dear Constitutionalist:  
<p>
Yes.  Don't watch the network news, only read conservative newspapers and listen to conservative talk radio.  Since you don't get a balanced view of the world from the mainstream media anyway, you won't be missing anything except a rise in your blood pressure every time you read the paper or watch the news.

Dear Cleta,<br>
<p>
I live in Utah, where the local politicians talk conservatively but act <br>like big spending liberals. For example, our governor actively pursues states <br>rights while he continues to support dumping large amounts of money into <br>a failing educational system and does not support vouchers.
<p>
How can we convince "conservative" politicians to support conservative causes?
<p>
-- Truly Conservative
</pre>
<p>
Dear Truly:
<p>
There are only two things that influence a politician:  votes and money.   The state teacher organizations have a lot of influence even with conservative Republican governors  because they represent lots of votes.  And not only do the teacher unions control the education agenda in most states, but the state school boards association, the school administrators organizations, and even the PTA are all together when it comes to opposing vouchers.  Until and unless the rank and file taxpaying public get organized to support parents' rights in the use of their tax dollars for school choice, the aforementioned organizations (which mostly operate with tax dollars, by the way) will continue to dominate the issue of vouchers, even with governors like Mike Leavitt.  In Utah, however, I would think that a natural ally for you would be the Mormon Church.  Do you know where it stands on school vouchers?  My advice would be to start organizing Mormon parents to get the church to be supportive of vouchers.  Add to that the parents who home school, the Christian Coalition and other family groups,  teachers who are willing to speak out against their union leadership on this issue, Catholic school parents and leaders, and you will have put together a grassroots coalition of parents and taxpayers who represent a lot of votes.  Then, your governor will start to pay attention.

Dear Cleta:
<p>
With the federal government doing so many detrimental things in so many <br>different arenas, what can a person do to combat this overwhelming takeover <br>of our God-given freedoms? Do we even have a Constitution any more? How can <br>they get away with this?
<p>
--Drowning in a sea of politicians
</pre>
<p>
Dear Drowning:
<p>
They get away with it for two reasons:  First,  because the careerists in Washington -- of BOTH political parties -- are more concerned about "getting things done on Capitol Hill" than in making sure they stop bad things from being done.  A good example is what has happened to the Republican Congress in the last six months.  The Democrats have basically put themselves back in charge of Congress and the Republicans have let them be back in charge -- so we have the GOP Congress passing an increase in the minimum wage because the minority (the Democrats) demand it.  That's why I love the House freshmen -- they aren't afraid to take a stand and draw a line in the sand.  It outrages all the insiders -- but the bad things have happened here due to the "go along, get along" philosophy that has ruled Washington for such a long time.
<p>
Second reason:  because average hardworking Americans are not equipped with the right kind of information to do anything about any of this.  Most people have no idea how their representatives and senators in Congress really vote on things that people care about.  And trying to find out voting records is not easy.  So we (my colleagues and I) are working to come up with a system to provide specific information to citizens on a regular basis about how the congressmen and senators vote on things -- and whether the votes are liberal or conservative.  Watch for more information about this effort!  I think if the public knew how most of these congressmen vote, the voters would make changes in Congress.  The politicians fear that, too, which is why they make it so hard for the public to know what they're doing.  We're working on a way to change that.

<p>
<font size=+3>D</font>uring his recent visit to the U.S., Pope John Paul II 
spoke movingly of how America's founding documents and the abolition 
of slavery are linked with the moral causes of today.  &quot;President
Lincoln's question is no less a question for the present generation
of Americans,&quot; the pope said in Baltimore.  &quot;Democracy cannot 
be sustained without a shared commitment to certain moral truths
about the human person and human community.&quot;
<p>
As slavery was in the years before the Civil War, abortion is
a defining moral question.  The issue &quot;that will not go away&quot; 
is once again on the front burner of public debate.  Interestingly enough,
while talk grows among some leading conservatives about the circumstances
under which they could endorse &quot;pro-choice&quot; politicians, several 
leading liberal publications are giving space to the weightiest arguments 
against abortion on demand.
<p>
<center><h3>Facing Reality</h3></center>
<p>
The cover story in September's <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> is devoted to
abortion.  Prof. George McKenna of the City College of New York writes 
of the inescapable parallels between the pro-slavery and 
pro-abortion movements, including their rhetoric of &quot;privacy,&quot;
&quot;choice,&quot; and the insistence that &quot;religion&quot; should 
not interfere in the controversy. McKenna argues that abortion opponents
should adopt a &quot;Lincolnian&quot; position designed not to
outlaw abortion immediately through legislation, but to restrict it while 
galvanizing public opinion against the practice.
<p>
Naomi Wolf, an avowed feminist, writes in an Oct. 16 <i>New Republic</i>
article entitled &quot;Our Bodies, Our Souls&quot; that the feminist 
movement errs when it fails to acknowledge that abortion is an 
&quot;evil,&quot; that it kills &quot;children&quot; and traumatizes many 
women. While Wolf does not abandon her &quot;pro-choice&quot; position, 
she does urge defenders of abortion to embrace a &quot;moral framework&quot; 
that mourns the loss of the aborted child.
<p>
To these ripples must be added the wave caused by the partial
conversion of Norma McCorvey to the anti-abortion cause.  McCorvey, 
the &quot;Jane Roe&quot; of <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, recently abandoned the
pro-abortion camp and was baptized a Christian.  In an interview
on <i>ABC News</i>, she cited the grief that overwhelmed her when she 
saw &quot;empty swings&quot; in a park and thought of the children
whose deaths by abortion she had helped to cause.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>"ABORTION IS A DEFINING<br>
MORAL QUESTION . . ."</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><h3>Taking Action</h3></center>
<p>
While the public debate takes new turns, Congress has begun to
take forthright action to restrict abortion.  The House of 
Representatives voted in August to ensure that no federal health monies
would be denied to medical schools that refuse to abide by the
new abortion training mandate from the Accreditation Council for 
Graduate Medical Education. The House also reinstated a
stronger version of the Hyde Amendment limiting federal abortion
funding.  Both of these amendments, plus a ban on federally supported 
human embryo research, were attached to the 1996 Labor, Health and 
Human Services appropriation bill.
<p>
Perhaps the most important measure right now is the Partial Birth
Abortion Ban Act (H.R. 1833), cosponsored by 152 members of Congress, 
including 25 Democrats. A &quot;partial birth&quot; abortion is
a technique used to kill babies in the second or third trimester.
 It involves deliberately breech-delivering the baby alive until only 
his/her head remains in the mother's uterus while the rest of the
body protrudes into the birth canal.  The abortionist then jabs
surgical scissors into the base of the
baby's skull, opens the scissors to widen the cavity, then uses
a vacuum catheter to suction out the
brain.  Delivery of the now-dead baby with its collapsed skull
completes the procedure. A vote in the full House -- an historic 
moment in the rejuvenated national abortion debate -- is imminent.
<p>
<center><h3>What You Can Do</h3></center>
<p>
Time is short.  Call 202-225-3121.  Urge your representative to
vote for H.R. 1833, the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act.  At the same 
time, urge him or her to stand fast for the pro-life House
positions in the 1996 Labor, Health, and Human Services bill.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>
<p><a name="tax>
<b>Families First.</b>  The long struggle to provide tax relief for America's
families took a big step forward as the Senate Finance Committee approved 
a permanent $500 per-child tax credit on Oct. 19.  Marriage penalty relief, 
expanded individual retirement accounts (IRAs), and adoption tax
credits were also included.  Since the House has already approved
an even larger tax relief package with similar provisions, it appears that 
Congress will soon put family tax relief on the President's desk.  White 
House officials continue to threaten a Presidential veto.
<p>
<b>Careering.</b>  Hasty politicking on job training bills has both houses
talking dollars but not sense. The Careers Bill (H.R. 1617) and the 
Workforce Development Act (S. 143) streamline federal job
training programs but fail to uproot elements of Goals 2000 and
the School-to-Work initiative, with its central economic planning features. 
Congressmen are playing right into this agenda by
mandating data collection for a vast Labor Market Information
System, and promoting the National Skill Standards Board.  H.R. 1617 and 
S. 143 passed in their respective houses and passage in some form now 
seems certain.
<p>
<b>Back from the Brink.</b>  According to the 1995 Trustees Report, Medicare
will be bankrupt by the year 2002 unless major reforms are enacted.  
The full House approved reforms on Oct. 19 which 
introduce competition and choice into the failing Medicare system.
 In addition to capping the growth in Medicare spending, Medisave 
accounts for seniors -- similar to those proposed for
working families in Rep. Bill Archer's (R-Tex.) H.R. 1818 -- would
be established.  These accounts would allow seniors to choose their 
own doctors and pay for services not covered by a
traditional insurance plan (i.e., prescription drugs or long-term
care premiums).
<p>
<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>
<p>
<b>Red-blooded Change.</b>  For years, the American Red Cross has produced
AIDS materials full of misinformation.  Condoms have been emphasized 
instead of behavioral change.  Recently, however, Red Cross officials 
reversed course, calling for abstinence, HIV testing, partner notification,
and discouragement of  illegal behavior.  The largest federally-funded
AIDS education group, Red Cross still has a ways to go, however, since 
it still uses a &quot;nonjudgmental approach to HIV/AIDS 
education&quot; for youth, omitting the terms &quot;husbands&quot;
and &quot;wives&quot; in favor of  &quot;partners&quot; and
portraying homosexuality as no different from heterosexuality.
<p>
<b>Teen Trends.</b> New studies from the Centers for Disease Control
(CDC) find that: 1) births to teenage mothers declined by 4 percent 
from 1991-1993; 2) teen pregnancy rates (including both
births and abortions) were down in a majority of states; and 3)
after 50 years of increases, birth
rates among unwed women of all ages have leveled off for three
years at 45.3 per 1,000 unmarried women.  These encouraging figures 
coincide with an increase in both abstinent teenagers and in states 
adopting legislation encouraging abstinence education.
<p>
<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>
<p>
<b>Out of Control.</b> The large volume of calls from indignant parents
and teachers to the National Education Association (NEA) indicate the union 
went too far when it decided to promote the 
&quot;celebration of a Lesbian and Gay History Month&quot; endorsed
by homosexual groups and the American Historical Association.  At 
least one of the groups promoting the October observance
seems ready to admit defeat.  The president of the Gay, Lesbian,
and Straight Teachers Network told an <i>Education Week</i> reporter 
that the conservative reaction was &quot;beyond our control.&quot; 
<p>
<b>Capping Debate.</b> When members of the House and Senate meet soon
to strike agreements on a welfare reform bill, the defining issue will 
be the family cap. If passed, the cap would deny a
federally-funded increase in cash benefits to mothers who bear
additional children while on welfare.  While modest in scope, the 
cap is a critical first step in a larger effort to renew personal
responsibility.  Massachusetts recently went further by introducing
the first legislation in the nation that would terminate cash payments 
to unwed teenage mothers.
<p><a name="poll">
<b>FRC Survey.</b>  FRC's fourth annual Family Issues Survey, to be released
in late November, shows that most Americans (66 percent) believe &quot;things 
have pretty seriously gotten off on the wrong track&quot; -- compared 
to 21 percent who feel that things in America are on the
&quot;right track.&quot;  High &quot;wrong-track&quot;
perceptions usually reflect economic problems, and, indeed, a
new Census Bureau study shows that middle-class incomes showed no 
gains last year.  Earnings for full-time workers actually
dropped.  However, FRC's poll also shows that the majority (61
percent) of those who think the country is on the wrong track cite 
&quot;the breakdown of the family and a decline in values&quot; rather
than U.S. economic problems.

<p>
<h3>Colorado Ambush?</h3>
<p>
Oral argument was held Oct. 10 in the U.S. Supreme Court over
Colorado's Amendment Two.  A decision is expected in early spring.  At 
issue is the voter-approved referendum amending Colorado's state 
constitution so that homosexuals do not qualify for special rights. 
The measure invalidates special homosexual rights laws in several cities,
including Aspen, Boulder and Denver, but was struck down by Colorado's 
liberal state supreme court.
<p>
Amendment Two was initiated by Coloradans who perceived that homosexual
rights laws threaten their freedoms of religion, association and speech, 
as well as economic liberties.  For example, Boy Scout programs have 
been attacked in many places where &quot;gay rights&quot; laws are in
effect.
<p>
If the tone of the questioning by justices was any indication,
the Amendment could be in for a rough ride.  Led by Clinton appointees 
Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, six justices asked questions 
that seemed hostile.  Only Justice Antonin Scalia vigorously defended 
the law, arguing that the people of Colorado do not discriminate merely
by approving limits on special rights for particular groups -- 
particularly those which are not bona fide minorities. Scalia noted
that many states prohibit bigamy and homosexual conduct.  If these
laws are constitutional, he asked, then why can't Colorado bar special 
status for sexual orientation?
<p>
Justice Ginsburg answered that Colorado repealed sodomy laws in
1972, and that passage of the Amendment constituted a denial of 
homosexuals' access to the political process.  Scalia said,
however, that if that logic is applied, then all groups disadvantaged
by state laws, including smokers, have suffered unconstitutional 
discrimination.
<p>
Oral arguments do not dictate how a case will be decided, but
the hearing showed just how liberal the court remains in some crucial areas. 
Family Research Council filed a &quot;friend of the court&quot;
brief warning that delicate matters are best resolved through
laws that reflect bedrock cultural values.  Drafted by attorney 
Melissa Wells-Petry, who has written widely in support of the
military's ban on homosexuals, the brief warns that a reversal
of Amendment Two would constitute as large and destructive a judicial 
power grab as occurred in <i>Roe v. Wade</i> (1973).

<p>
<h3>Kinsey Breakthrough</h3>
<p>
Answering charges raised by FRC's new video, <i>The Children of 
Table 34</i>, Kinsey Institute Director John Bancroft told the 
<i>Indianapolis Star</i> (Sept. 19) that he believes the child sex data 
in the famous Kinsey Report from the 1940s was the work of one pedophile.
This account contradicts that of Alfred C. Kinsey himself, who wrote in 
<i>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</i> (1948) that explicit sexual 
data on 317 youngsters was collected by nine pedophiles.
<p>
Kinsey's findings continue to be the most influential data on
sex research published in this century.  Because the data have been 
used to validate the idea of child sexuality that animates most of
sexology and today's sex education, public illumination of Kinsey's
ethical swamp may lead to educational, legal and scientific reform. 
FRC is pressing Congress for an investigation into the
Kinsey Institute's child sexuality files, whose existence Dr.
Bancroft has now confirmed.  First
questions:  Who was the aforementioned pedophile and how did he
get access to hundreds of children, including infants?  Dr. Judith 
Reisman, who first explored the Kinsey child data in a 1981 monograph, 
and later in the 1990 book <i>Kinsey, Sex and Fraud</i>
with co-author Edward Eichel and editors Dr. J. Gordon Muir and Dr. 
John H. Court, says she is encouraged that the 50-year-old mystery 
might finally be solved.
<P>
Meanwhile, FRC is appealing the Public Broadcasting Service's
rejection of <i>The Children of Table 34</i> for airing. PBS 
designates June as Gay Pride Month and, in mid-October, began 
running a four-part series celebrating homosexual activism.  This
same PBS says that the FRC video presents a &quot;conflict&quot; 
because FRC, as a pro-family group, has an interest in the material. 
Presumably, the &quot;conflict&quot; is that the film accords with
FRC's stated aim of protecting children from sexual abuse.
<p>
The Kinsey Institute is still a heavy recipient of taxpayer money
through its connection with Indiana University.  Kinsey's work and 
continuing influence are long overdue for public scrutiny.

<center><font size=+2><b><i>FRC Goes to the Wire</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer</center>
<p>
<font size=+3>R</font>ecently I ran into Republican Sen. Arlen Specter of 
Pennsylvania after a lunch in the Senate Dining Room in the U.S. Capitol. 
Many times the senator and I have taken debater's chairs opposite each 
other, even discussing some of our differences on national television.
<p>
&quot;You're the only one who will debate with me about abortion,&quot;
he told me and joked that we should take our &quot;act&quot; on the road.
It has been a privilege for me to talk about social issues on
behalf of the many people who support the Family Research Council. Every 
day, reporters from organizations such as <i>The New York Times</i>, 
<i>The Washington Post</i> and the nightly news shows call us
at FRC for our -- and what we hope is your -- perspective.  But usually 
an hour-long conversation with a reporter becomes a 10-second soundbite 
on the network news or less than an inch of copy at the bottom of a 
two-column story.
<p>
Not any longer.  Our dream of providing a pro-family voice is
much bigger than merely building a conservative &quot;speed bump&quot; 
in a vast terrain of liberal reporting. That is why we are about to
premiere our own television show.  Our vision is to help a national
audience understand not only what we believe but why we support the kind 
of pro-family reforms that we advocate daily in Washington. Our aim is 
to make a connection with even more of those millions of Americans
who go to work every morning worrying about the kind of world
their children are inheriting.
<p>
Beginning Wednesday, Nov. 1, &quot;Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council&quot; will air at 8 p.m. on the new cable network 
National Empowerment Television (NET). We will be coming to
you on a weekly basis thereafter.
<p>
The show includes such segments as &quot;Behind the Headlines,&quot;
an insider's look at what is happening to the family in Washington, 
and &quot;Homefront News,&quot; which will highlight what FRC
has been doing to bolster the family.  The majority of our show,
however, will be fast-paced discussions of the answers pro-family 
advocates offer to the tough social questions we face today.
<p>
We believe &quot;Straight Talk&quot; has the potential to break
out of the 10-second soundbite box that conservatives usually occupy 
on television.  Family issues deserve in-depth treatment.  Most of
all, we hope to provide you with the kind of informative discussion
that will help you in your own understanding of the state of the 
family today -- in politics, in society, and beyond.
<p>
This is an exciting new venture for FRC.  NET now reaches into
more than 11 million homes and is growing daily. &quot;Straight Talk&quot; 
is an important addition to the network's menu.  We invite you to
watch and share your comments with us as the show unfolds.
<p>
Here's thanking you in advance for the kind of support that has
made &quot;Straight Talk&quot; possible.

<center><h2><font size=+3>S</font>PECIAL <font size=+3>R</font>EPORT:</h2>
<h4>Lobbying Reform</h4></center>
<p><hr width=30% size=2><p>
For years, political advocacy groups have taken advantage of the
public purse to finance their agenda.  Groups like Planned Parenthood 
receive millions of federal dollars each year, even as 
they engage in high-powered lobbying and political advocacy.
<p>
During its consideration of a multi-billion dollar appropriations
bill earlier this year, the House of Representatives adopted an 
amendment to prohibit recipients of federal grants from spending any
grant funds on political advocacy.  The amendment, sponsored by
Rep. Ernest Istook (R-Okla.), also proposed strict limits on the 
amount of political advocacy a grantee could engage in with
&quot;non-grant&quot; funds.  Rep. David McIntosh (R-Ind.) chairs
a House subcommittee that has held hearings and urged limits on such 
advocacy.
<p>
A coalition of liberal organizations has mounted a fierce campaign
to scuttle lobbying reform. This campaign has stalled the Treasury-Postal 
appropriations bill for several weeks.  The Clinton
Administration is threatening a veto if the Istook-McIntosh provision
is included in the final bill. The issue is likely to come to a head in 
mid-November.
<p>
<b>Action Item:</b> Call your congressman and senators today.  Tell
them it is time for genuine reform of the congressional spending process. 
A vital first step is to end &quot;welfare&quot; for lobbyists. 
<p><hr><p>

<p>
To help politicians summon the courage to scale back the role
of government in American life, FRC will host a one-day symposium 
on Dec. 13 in Washington, D.C. The topic will be government's 
contribution to cultural decay.  The conference will launch a new 
initiative to cultivate charitable alternatives to the welfare state. 
Under the leadership of Forest Thigpen, the Mississippi Family Council 
recently hosted a similar event, entitled &quot;Leading People Out of 
Poverty,&quot; that attracted some of the nation's leading authorities 
on reform. To order tapes, contact the Mississippi Family Council at 
(601) 969-1200.

<p>

<font size=+3>I</font>n 1888, the U.S. Supreme Court declared that marriage 
is &quot;the foundation of the family and of society, without which there 
would be neither civilization nor progress.&quot;

<p>

Because of its crucial role, marriage has a special status within
the culture and the law.  Its essence -- the joining of one man
and one woman in an exclusive legal, sexual, economic and spiritual
bond with the procreation of children as a desirable and common
result -- had not been seriously challenged for thousands of years.

<p>

<center><h3>Hawaiian Havoc</h3></center>

<p>

Now, a tiny segment of a tiny fraction of the population -- the
homosexual activist community -- is on the verge of radically
redefining marriage and family.  If they succeed, all distinctions
based on sex may fall, and the worst aspects of the rejected Equal
Rights Amendment will be imposed.  Homosexuals will gain the &quot;right&quot;
to adopt children; schoolchildren will be taught that homosexual
sex is the equivalent of marital love between husband and wife;
businesses will be forced to subsidize homosexual relationships;
churches will be pushed outside the civil law; and government
power will be wielded against anyone who holds the biblical view
of homosexuality.

<p>

In August, a Hawaiian court is expected to strike down that state's
law limiting marriage to &quot;one man and one woman.&quot;  The
case, <i>Baehr v. Lewin,</i> was brought by three same-sex couples
who charged the state with &quot;discrimination&quot; for not
granting them marriage licenses.  Despite widespread opposition
within Hawaii (recent polls show that 71% of Hawaiians oppose
same-sex &quot;marriage&quot;), homosexual activists hope to impose
their agenda through compliant courts.

<p>

Because the U.S. Constitution's Full Faith and Credit Clause calls
for states to honor each other's laws, homosexuals are planning
to fly to Hawaii, &quot;marry,&quot; and return to the mainland
to claim &quot;married&quot; status.  About 25 states now have
efforts underway to protect marriage, and three of them -- Hawaii,
Utah and South Dakota -- have enacted new laws protecting marriage.

<p>

In Washington, a bill is being drafted to bind the federal government
to a &quot;one-man, one-woman&quot; definition of marriage.  Tentatively
titled the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), the bill would protect
the military, Social Security,  and all federal agencies from
radical redefinition of wedlock.

<p>

<center><h3>Full Court Press</h3></center>

<p>

The marriage battle is being fought while several other key cases
involving homosexuality are being decided in the nation's courts.
The Supreme Court is expected to rule soon in a key Colorado
case in which voters had passed a constitutional amendment to
bar any city or county from enacting special rights based on sexual
orientation.  About a dozen cases challenging the military's ban
on homosexuality are being heard around the nation.

<p>

In Georgia, a federal appeals court ruled in favor of a lesbian
fired from her job at the state attorney general's office after
she announced that she had  &quot;married&quot; her lover.  Bear
in mind that the attorney general is required to defend Georgia's
sodomy law.  In  New York, the state's high court opened adoption
proceedings to homosexual couples and unmarried heterosexual couples,
thus devaluing marriage and jeopardizing children.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

The pattern is clear:  homosexual activists are using the courts
to get what they cannot achieve through democracy.  But the courts
do not operate in a vacuum.  U.S. Supreme Court justices noted
that one factor that affected the <i>Casey</i> decision upholding
<i>Roe v. Wade</i> was the court's public image.  Amherst legal
scholar Hadley Arkes notes that if Americans boldly defend marriage,
the courts may hesitate to radically redefine it.  If the states
pass marriage protection bills, and Congress enacts DOMA, the
judicial assault on traditional morality could falter.

<p>

<center><h3>What You Can Do</h3></center>

<p>

Call your Congressman and Senators and ask that they cosponsor
the coming Defense of Marriage Act.  The Capitol Hill switchboard
is 202-225-3121.

<p>

Call state legislators and ask them to support your state's marriage
protection bill, or if there isn't yet such a bill, ask them to
sponsor one.

<p>

Educate yourself about the threat to marriage today -- from mistaken
public policies and cultural decay.  Consult the enclosed reply
card for information on new resources that defend this embattled,
but essential institution.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>

<p>

<b>Border Order.</b>  H.R. 2202 by Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.),
and two competing Senate bills, Alan Simpson's (R-Wyo.) S. 1394
and Spencer Abraham's (R-Mich.) S. 1535, each seek to reform immigration
policy.  FRC deplores nativist rhetoric and supports provisions
which reflect the following principles:  (1) Illegal immigration
must be halted; America should not reward those whose first act
in this country is to break the law, and (2) America must remain
a country that welcomes legal immigrants, with appropriate safeguards
for our national sovereignty.

<p>

<b>Red Letter.</b> President Clinton went on record in a Feb.
28 letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah),
saying he will veto the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act when it
reaches his desk.  Mr. Clinton claims the legislation is unacceptable
because it does not protect a woman's life or &quot;health.&quot;
FRC responded by saying, &quot;That President Clinton would veto
a ban on a procedure characterized as four-fifths infanticide
and one-fifth abortion shows his clear disregard for the value
of human life.&quot;

<p><a name="gamble">

<b>Gambling Gambit.</b> On March 5, the House of Representatives
passed legislation to establish the National Gambling Impact and
Policy Commission.  The nine-member commission would conduct a
two-year study and report its findings to states, Congress and
the president. &quot;[T]his legislation creates no new regulations
and imposes no new mandates on gambling or state and local governments,&quot;
said its sponsor, Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.).  The sole purpose,
he added, is to help communities make informed decisions on gambling
questions.  Senate consideration is next.

<p>

<b>Healthy Debate.</b> On April 18-19 the Senate will debate
a health insurance reform bill sponsored by Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.)
and Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.).  The bill, which President Clinton
supports, does <I>not</I> contain medical savings accounts (MSA's),
and would give Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala
the power to ensure that state health insurance plans conform
with the &quot;goals&quot; of the bill, including &quot;comprehensive
coverage.&quot;  A related House bill, sponsored by Rep. Dennis
Hastert (R-Ill.), is expected to contain MSA's, no new taxes,
and no defined comprehensive benefits package.

<p>

<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>

<p>

<b>Teens and AIDS.</b> A new study released by the White House
advocates more efforts to reduce the spread of AIDS among teenagers.
Twenty-five percent of Americans infected with AIDS each year
are under the age of 20.  The report calls for more explicit AIDS
education and HIV testing without parental notice.  Meanwhile,
a House-Senate conference committee on the Ryan White Care Act
reauthorization is deadlocked over an amendment by Reps. Tom Coburn,
M.D. (R-Okla.) and Gary Ackerman (D-N.Y.) to require AIDS testing
of newborns.  The Clinton administration opposes the requirement.
FRC supports it.

<p><a name="prayer">

<b>Wing and a Prayer.</b> The Department of Transportation is
at odds with a DOT employees' group over whether a prayer and
fellowship group can label homosexual behavior a sin.  The 50-member
Christian organization has waited more than 14 months for official
status because it rejects a &quot;nondiscrimination&quot; clause
that includes sexual orientation.  Group leaders say they welcome
homosexuals, but cannot agree to give them leadership positions
or sanction actions they consider sinful.  Meanwhile, DOT has
already given preferential treatment to GLOBE, the Gay, Lesbian
or Bisexual Employees group.

<p>

<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>

<p>

<b>Court-Assisted Suicide.</b> The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ruled March 7 that Washington state's ban on assisted
suicide is unconstitutional.  The next day, a Michigan jury acquitted
Dr. Jack Kevorkian on charges of assisting in the suicide of two
individuals, the second time he has been exonerated.  Judge Stephen
Reinhardt, writing for the Ninth Circuit's 8-3 majority, directly
linked the ruling with <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, the 1973 case that
established abortion on demand.  Decision by Washington state
officials on an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court is pending.

<p>

<b>Damsels in Distress.</b> A new Population Reference Bureau
study confirms what Massachusetts and California have already
found:  about two-thirds of births to teenage girls are fathered
by men age 20 or older.  In addition, a 1994 Alan Guttmacher Institute
report found that six of 10 girls who had sex before age 15 were
coerced by males an average of six years their senior.  As more
girls grow up without fathers to protect their honor, their search
for a father figure leaves them more vulnerable to predatory males.

<p>

<b>Grave But Stable?</b> Another Population Reference Bureau
report reveals both positive and negative trends among U.S. families.
Good news is that the divorce rate has leveled off, the growth
rate of single-parent families has been halved, and more two-parent
families with children have formed. However, the report also shows
that the U.S. still has the world's highest divorce rate and that
single-parent families are increasing three percent annually.
Census reports such as these sometimes reflect only a change in
demographics, not a genuine attitudinal shift.

<h3>FRC Soldiers On</h3>

<p>

FRC's Military Readiness Project (MRP) was present on March 4
in Seattle, Washington when the ACLU and the Clinton Justice Department
once again misrepresented the military's homosexual law.  In the
case of <i>Philips v. Perry</i> which involves a homosexual sailor
who admitted to misconduct, Justice's attorney told a three-judge
appeals court panel that what the military has is a &quot;homosexual
accommodation law.&quot;  In fact, it has always had an exclusion
policy.

<p>

The government cited as evidence the fiction that some homosexual
service members have successfully convinced administrative boards
that being homosexual does not mean that they will engage in
illicit conduct.  At the hearing the ACLU asserted that homosexuals
can legally serve, and then argued that the <i>Philips</i> case
was really about discrimination.  Unbelievably, it took a judge
(a Bush-appointee) to highlight the fact that Philips had admitted
to homosexual sex with &quot;a dozen&quot; men.

<p>

The MRP has participated in five federal appeals court cases.
Most recently, on March 15, it joined the <i>Richtenberg v. Perry</i>
case which involves an Air Force captain who declared himself
a homosexual.  Like the others, he seeks to invalidate the law
and the Pentagon's regulations.  This case may present another
opportunity for the MRP to make oral arguments, as it did last
December in <i>Thomasson v. Perry</i>. The MRP will defend the
underlying law, and the Clinton Justice Department will defend
the faulty &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; implementing regulations.

<p>

Two cases soon to be decided, <i>Abel v. U.S.A.</i> and <i>Thomasson</i>,
are competing for the attention of the Supreme Court.  Decisions
in both cases are expected this spring, and one of them will be
appealed to the high court this summer with oral arguments likely
during the court's next term.

<p>

Meanwhile, a new administration could discard Clinton's faulty
&quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; regulations and require the
Justice Department to defend the law before the Supreme Court.
In any event, major news on this issue is only months away.

<h3>Rx for the Drug War</h3>

<p>

On Feb. 15, FRC hosted a national drug abuse prevention strategy
meeting.  Nationally known experts from diverse backgrounds and
regions came together to develop an eight-part action plan.  The
participants agreed:  the drug scourge is getting worse, and something
must be done to reignite grass-roots anti-drug efforts.

<p>

The strategy has a two-part prevention focus:  use of mind/mood-altering
drugs is dangerous to the individual and society, and comprehensive
community-based prevention is the most viable solution to the
drug crisis.

<p>

Drug education must begin at home.  The strategy calls for drug
education resources to be tied to accountability.  Drug abuse
messages must be congruent and consistently broadcast through
every educational setting (homes, schools, workplaces, communities
and media).

<p>

Law enforcement must identify all users and impose consequences
on abuse.  It must also create systematic accountability for funding
and success rates.  Key to the strategy is leadership.  Leaders
at all levels must speak clearly and serve as role models.

<p>

Grass-roots citizen action is vital.  Accountability for drug
abuse prevention must be locally based, and citizen groups must
have power over funds to make their programs work.  The media
must stop glamorizing drugs and provide truthful alternative messages.
The strategy calls for an annual report on media handling of
the drug prevention message.

<p>

Treatment for abusers should be delivered at the point of need
with accountability.  This includes providing appropriate long-term
treatment.  Finally, the strategy calls for reallocating available
drug funds with strict standards.  This year the federal government
will spread $13 billion across 140 programs with little accountability.

<p>

FRC wants the strategy to influence each political party's presidential
platform and all future drug-related legislation.   It provides
a federal model for the drug war that focuses the government on
supply interdiction and passes responsibility and fiscal authority
for prevention and treatment to local communities.

<p>

FRC's short-term goal is to have drug abuse recognized as a national
crisis. America must aim to cut current abuse levels at least
in half by the year 2000.  The long-term goal is the eradication
of drug abuse.

<font size=+2><b><i>Bashers, Bombers and Bigots</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer
</center>

<p>

Several years ago, radical homosexual members of the ACT-UP group
invaded St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City and desecrated
the Host.  Millions of Christians around the world believe that
Christ is really present in the sacrament of communion.  America
has had, tragically, anti-Catholic riots in its history.  &quot;Know
Nothing&quot; mobs even dumped one of the stones intended for
the Washington Monument into the Potomac because it had been generously
donated by the pope.  But Act-Up's church invasion set a new low
for efforts to offend the deeply held religious beliefs of a whole
community.

<p>

In suburban Washington, D.C., the Montrose Baptist Church has
twice been the site of suspicious fires.  No one has been charged
with arson, but church members have cited the congregation's strong
pro-life stance and its high profile during the 1992 Maryland
abortion referendum as making it a likely target in liberal Montgomery
County.

<p>

Now we have even more disturbing evidence of hatred in action.
At least 25 black churches have been hit in a new wave of arson
in California and a number of southern states. This form of bigotry
cannot be tolerated. That is why I have joined with a group of
black, Jewish, Catholic and evangelical Christian leaders to call
for prompt hearings by the Judiciary Committees of the House and
Senate.

<p>

The current wave of church bombings began on April 4, 1993.  That
was the 25th anniversary of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr.  The pace of these attacks has picked up since January,
1995.  There is evidence of a pattern here, a pattern that suggests
a conspiracy to violate our civil rights laws. There is every
reason for the federal government to act.

<p>

It does not matter what motivates the haters.  Whether it is a
<i>Hamas</i> suicide bomber who catches Bus No. 18 in Jerusalem,
or a racist who wants to terrorize black Christians peacefully
worshipping here at home, terrorism is evil and we must mobilize
against it.

<center>
<i><font size=+2>WE MUST MOBILIZE AGAINST<br>
TERRORISM.</font></i>
</center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

This is also a good time to reassert the real meaning of the First
Amendment. The right of the people to the &quot;free exercise&quot;
of religion is a precious one, bought with the blood of patriots
and martyrs.  Millions of our American ancestors came to this
country seeking this right above all others.

<p>

It does not help the cause of religious tolerance when the federal
government itself treats religion as a suspect classification.
Christian employees of the Federal Aviation Administration are
still finding their request to start a prayer group stiff-armed
by bureaucrats who welcome gay activist groups (see 
<a href="#news"><I>Newswatch</I></a>).

<p>

Moreover, the Clinton administration has recently moved to squelch
tuition assistance which has been provided since 1929 for Americans
serving in Ecuador.  The parents who chose the Alliance Academy,
a Christian school, were evidently pleased with the quality of
education provided and the spiritual and moral guidance their
children received there.  But now, with the opening of a completely
secular private school in Ecuador's capital, Quito, parents have
been told to enroll their kids in this private school or forego
the assistance the U.S. government has long provided.

<p>

Anti-Semitism, anti-Catholicism and racism have no place in our
sweet land of liberty. Nor does the disdainful view of too many
that religion itself is to be discouraged. As Irving Kristol has
wisely noted:  &quot;The real danger is not from a revived Christianity...but
from an upsurge of antibiblical barbarism that will challenge
Christianity, Judaism and Western Civilization together.&quot;
To which, I say: &quot;Amen!&quot;

<p>

<font size=+3>F</font>rom defending marriage to fighting to prevent the 
killing of the unborn late in pregnancy to presenting an unprecedented
balanced budget with family tax relief, the 104th Congress took
historic steps for America's families, according to Family Research
Council President Gary Bauer.

<p>

<center><h3>Missions Met</h3></center>

<p>

To be sure, the 104th Congress did not achieve all of its
objectives.  But the addition of a large group of conservative
freshmen substantially changed the legislative agenda.  These
freshmen apparently had an impact on national policy even before
they took office.  On Nov. 10, 1994 -- two days after the election
that reversed control of Congress -- the Justice Department abandoned
its two-year effort to weaken the interpretation of a child pornography
statute.  According to a new book by former Surgeon General Joycelyn
Elders, the election results also prompted the administration
to reverse a decision to provide clean needles to drug addicts.

<p>

The new chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the
Constitution, Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.), was in the forefront
of congressional initiatives to defend the traditional definition
of marriage and ban partial-birth abortions.  Canady held very
illuminating hearings in his subcommittee, helping to set the
stage for overwhelming House approval of the Defense of Marriage
Act and the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban.

<p>

Sen. Don Nickles (R-Okla.), the Senate sponsor of the Defense
of Marriage Act (DOMA), fended off an effort by Sens. Ted Kennedy
(D-Mass.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and others to attach the
Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) and other pro-homosexual
amendments to DOMA.  The Human Rights Campaign, a major homosexual
rights advocacy group, took credit for developing this amendment
strategy to &quot;derail&quot; the Defense of Marriage Act, which
they alleged was &quot;hate-driven.&quot;  Nickles and Majority
Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) negotiated an agreement that provided
for a clean vote on DOMA, followed by an up or down vote on Sen.
Kennedy's ENDA proposal.

<p>

An overwhelming majority of senators agreed with the argument
that marriage was not instituted to 'discriminate' against homosexuals,
but rather to unite one man and one woman and provide a strong
foundation for the nurturing of children.  President Clinton signed
DOMA into law at 12:50 a.m. on Sept. 21.  Despite last-minute
phone calls from the president to wavering senators, the Kennedy
homosexual jobs proposal came up one vote short, 49-50.

"THE 104TH CONGRESS<br>
TOOK HISTORIC STEPS."
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

Congress produced strong majorities in favor of the Partial-Birth
Abortion Ban, but on Sept. 26 the Senate fell eight votes short
of the two-thirds majority necessary to override a veto.
Despite administration objections, Congress did succeed in enacting
five pro-life provisions as amendments to spending bills.  One
of these measures protects medical schools from the loss of federal
funds if they refuse to provide abortion training. Another restores
a limitation on funding of abortions through federal employees'
health insurance programs.

<p>

<center><h3>More Vetoes</h3></center>

<p>

Several new anti-pornography bills were enacted and signed
into law by the president, but they will face difficult battles
in the courts.  Congress passed a balanced budget and family tax
relief package, but it was vetoed.  A modified welfare reform
package was enacted into law after stronger measures were twice
vetoed.

<p>

Line-item veto authority was provided to the president, effective
January 1997.  Vice President Gore suggested on a weekend news
program that this would give the administration leverage to press
Congress to liberalize welfare policies.

<p>

Since every new Congress starts with a clean slate, the policies
enacted during the past two years will be subject to revision
by the next Congress and president.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>

<p>

<b>FDA Checks Parents.</b> House Commerce Committee Chairman
Thomas J. Bliley (R-Va.) recently held hearings into why the FDA
refuses to allow the marketing of an Atlanta mother's drug testing
kit to parents who want to test their children.  FDA regulations
label the kit (a plastic cup and a shipping box) as a &quot;Class
III&quot; medical device, equivalent to an MRI or  pacemaker.
Even though businesses and athletic teams use the same kit, the
FDA claims it &quot;is concerned about issues such as anonymity,
confidentiality, coercion, and family discord.&quot;  Will the
same considerations govern FDA rulings on RU-486?

<p><a name="ex-gay">

<b>Hope for Homosexuals.</b> On Oct. 10, FRC co-sponsored a press
conference for the Second Annual Coming Out of Homosexuality Day
(Oct. 11) and the new support group, Parents, Family and Friends
of Ex-Gays (PFOX).  Hosted by Michael Johnston, a former homosexual
who is HIV-positive, the event was taped for C-SPAN.  FRC Cultural
Studies Director Bob Knight also spoke, along with <I>Lambda Report</I>
editor Peter LaBarbera, the Philadelphia Family Policy Council's
Bill Devlin, Tom and Ann Taylor, who have a homosexual son, and
ex-homosexuals Anthony Falzarano and Jane Boyer.

<p>

<b>Refuge for Abortion Victims.</b> Several immigration provisions
were rolled into the FY 1997 Omnibus Appropriations package, including
a humanitarian measure which allows people fleeing from coercive
abortion policies to seek asylum in the United States.  Effective
immediately, asylum may be granted for up to 1,000 people per
year who have been forcibly aborted or involuntarily sterilized,
or have a well-founded fear of persecution under coercive population
control policies. This restores a similar policy which was effective
under the Reagan and Bush administrations.

<p>

<b>Immigrants and AIDS Treatment.</b> Congress dropped a provision
in its immigration legislation preventing taxpayer-funding of
HIV-AIDS treatment for legal and illegal aliens.  Rep. Lamar Smith
(R-Texas) and Sen. Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.), chairmen of House and
Senate immigration subcommittees, said the change could encourage
&quot;thousands of HIV-infected aliens to seek asylum in the U.S.&quot;
Despite a 1993 law barring admission of HIV-positive immigrants,
earlier this year the White House directed the Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS) to consider granting asylum to HIV-positive
individuals.

<p>

<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>

<p>

<b>Elders on Drugs.</b> As Surgeon General, Joycelyn Elders called
for a drug legalization study, favored giving needles to
addicts and advocated marijuana as medicine.  On Oct. 9, she blamed
the new teenage drug epidemic on easy-to-get marijuana and then
said pot &quot;probably causes very little problem to anyone.&quot;
Marijuana can be addictive, damages the immune system, causes
respiratory diseases and mental disorders, and impairs coordination
and judgment.

<p>

<b>Gagging Chaplains.</b> Air Force Reserve chaplain Fr. Vincent
Rigdon has filed a federal lawsuit against the Secretary of Defense
(<I>Rigdon v. Perry</I>) for interfering with his religious liberty
and free speech by issuing a &quot;gag order&quot; that bars religious
leaders from discussing specific legislation in sermons or counseling.
In June, a Pentagon directive to Catholic military chaplains
prohibited them from &quot;participating or urging others to participate&quot;
in a nationwide postcard mailing to Congress which supported a
vote to override the veto of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act.

<p>

<b>Bork's Beatitudes.</b> Will America survive?  Not without
strong churches, says Robert Bork, respected jurist and author
of the controversial new book <I>Slouching Towards Gomorrah: 
Modern Liberalism and American Decline.</I> Bork contends that
the loss of reliable standards of right and wrong has resulted
in a &quot;loss of nerve, which means the community cannot summon
the will to suppress&quot; many social ills such as pornography
and crime. &quot;The Church which ought to be shaping and influencing
culture is instead being influenced by culture,&quot; Bork says.

<p>

<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>

<p>

<b>Insulting Hispanics.</b> Apparently, the Enola Gay controversy
taught the Smithsonian Institute little.  Hispanic Heritage Month,
which ended on Oct. 15, featured Andres Serrano, best known for
his vulgar and anti-Christian art.  (His creations include a crucifix
immersed in a jar of urine.)  The Hispanic community lacks not
for serious artists.  Selecting Serrano &quot;because of the body
of his work&quot; reveals the politically correct values of the
Smithsonian.  Such art merits no taxpayer money.  The real irony
is that Serrano would receive no support if his works glorified
Christian symbols.

<p><a name="pentagon">

<b>PX Porn Challenge.</b> Now that the sale of pornographic materials
at military stores has been prohibited, <I>Penthouse</I> publisher
Bob Guccione is challenging the 1997 Defense Authorization Bill,
claiming it is unconstitutional.  Guccione's magazine alone earned
$1.16 of the $4.6 million in 1995 sales at the Pentagon's worldwide
chain of tax-supported stores.  Mr. Guccione's real gripe with
the new law may be its threat to his revenues.  Getting the U.S.
government out of the porn business has been an accomplishment
10 years in the making.

<p>

<b>BULLETIN --</b> In education news, the CAREERS bill (H.R. 1617)
died with the closing of the 104th Congress.  The issue of job
training reform will most likely be raised again in the 105th
Congress next year.

<h3>Katy Bar The Schoolhouse Door To Parents</h3>

<p>

Parents effectively lose their right to direct the upbringing
of their children when they drop them off at school, according
to one federal court judge.  Earlier this year, Judge Melinda
Harmon, appointed by President Bush, ruled that Katy Independent
School District in Texas did not violate parents' rights by allowing
Child Protective Services to interrogate a student without notifying
his parents, nor by instructing him to lie to his parents about
the incident.

<p>

Take, for example, the case of 6-year-old Jonathan Prevette,
who last month kissed a classmate in Lexington, N.C.  Such incidents
have a long history in schoolyards across America and, until now,
were brushed off as childhood innocence, or reprimanded by teachers
and principals after discussing the situation with parents.  But
this time it was called &quot;sexual harassment.&quot;  The &quot;culprit&quot;
was suspended for a misdemeanor he can't even spell.

<p>

What prompted such a response?  Perhaps it was a nudge from
the U.S. Education Department, which this summer distributed guidelines
urging schools to set up sexual harassment policies.  Schools
were warned that under Title IX &quot;gender equity&quot; provisions
for federally funded programs, they may be held liable for letting
&quot;sexual harassment&quot; among students go unnoticed.

<p>

With even admiring looks now considered &quot;sexual harassment,&quot;
it is no wonder a school would seek cover from lawsuits by laying
down a blanket prohibition against anything remotely affectionate.
Ironically, the very same federal Education Department has promoted
sex education schemes that push condoms and the like on boys and
girls at even younger ages.

<p>

Such cold, heavy-handed responses to children like Jonathan
Prevette will continue if federal court decisions shut parents
out and let a remote and liberal federal education bureaucracy
hand down one-size-fits-all policies.  Embracing parents, on the
other hand, would result in the improved discipline and academics
many schools now seek in vain.

<h3>A Duty to Die?</h3>

<p>

The Supreme Court has accepted two important cases concerning
doctor-aided suicide.  In <I>Glucksburg v. Washington</I>, the
Ninth Circuit federal court &quot;found&quot; a constitutional
&quot;liberty&quot; right for terminally-ill patients to be killed
by their doctors.  Judge Stephen Reinhardt explained that his
reasoning is &quot;identical&quot; to the Supreme Court abortion
cases of <I>Roe v. Wade</I> and <I>Planned Parenthood v. Casey</I>.
These poisonous precedents live on, defending the destruction
of life.

<p>

The other case creates a constitutional right to be killed
by a doctor, not based on &quot;liberty&quot; but &quot;equality.&quot;
The Second Circuit federal court in <I>Vacco v. Quill</I> declared
that the New York law against causing or assisting suicide was
unconstitutional because it discriminates among terminally-ill
people.  According to the court, refusing artificial life support
and getting a lethal injection are equivalent, and since the former
is permitted, the latter may not be prohibited.

<p>

If these decisions are not overturned by the high court,
a &quot;right to die&quot; may soon become a &quot;duty to die&quot;
for those most in need.

<p>

A recent report on the Netherlands euthanasia experience
by Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.) provides a compelling context
for the current debate on doctor-assisted suicide in America.
Euthanasia of the terminally ill in the Netherlands has been
expanded since its inception in 1973 to permit the killing of
healthy people experiencing psychological distress.  Voluntary
euthanasia has given way to involuntary euthanasia, called &quot;termination
of the patient without explicit request.&quot;  In 1990, 1,000
people in the Netherlands were killed without their consent, 140
of whom were fully competent.

<p>

FRC is part of a broad coalition of groups urging the Court
to overturn the lower rulings, drafting <I>amicus</I> briefs detailing
the right of society to forbid euthanasia, and recounting the
tragedy of pre-Nazi Germany, where mercy killing was thought to
be the compassionate response to the plight of physically or mentally
disabled people, &quot;life unworthy of life.&quot;  Germany has
learned from its horrific mistakes, and now calls mercy killing
a crime against humanity.  Pray that the Supreme Court will not
sacrifice the lives of the infirm as they have done the lives
of the unborn.

<font size=+2><b><i>An Exercise of Citizenship</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer
</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>E</font>veryone needs to belong, to identify with something 
larger than self.  For some it is religion, for some it is a social 
construct, and for virtually all, it is national identity, citizenship, a
precious commodity involving rights, duties, and privileges.
I for one cannot imagine what it would be like to be the fabled
&quot;man without a country&quot; -- a man without citizenship.

<p>

Millions of people have left friends, family and their native
lands to immigrate, often at great personal risk, to the United
States.  Why?  Inscribed on the Statue of Liberty are the words,
&quot;Give me your tired, your poor; your huddled masses yearning
to breathe free. ...&quot;  That's it.  They come here for freedom.
Freedom of opportunity, of religion, from oppression, to raise
their families, to educate their children, to associate with friends
of their choice, and to achieve the American Dream.  They have
come because America is the land of the free.

<p>

Becoming an American involves more than a labeling process.
It implies adopting our language, customs, and national as well
as historical traditions.  It requires swearing allegiance to
the Constitution of the United States, renouncing fidelity to
any foreign state, and expressing willingness to serve this nation
as required by and under the law.

<p>

Recently, however, the process of becoming a U.S. citizen
has been &quot;dumbed down.&quot;  In the last 12 months, according
to published accounts, the Immigration and Naturalization Service
has conducted a full-court press to naturalize more than 1.2 million
new citizens.  Congressional hearings reveal that in the process,
longstanding rules have been bent, the citizenship test has been
simplified, citizenship has been granted to people who could not
speak English and, in many cases, criminal background checks may
have been bypassed.

<p>

Despite denial by the INS, evidence suggests that in at least
one case, hundreds of tests were submitted all of which were completed
in the same handwriting.  Extensive testimony before the Senate
Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration alleges a White House-initiated,
election-year effort to dramatically accelerate the naturalization
of new immigrants prior to Nov. 5.

<p>

The blessings of this land have not been bought cheaply.
Millions have paid the ultimate price while defending our way
of life.  To grant citizenship cheaply to anyone who applies or
for political advantage is an insult to those who have served
this nation.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

"THE BLESSINGS OF THIS<br>
LAND HAVE NOT BEEN<br>
BOUGHT CHEAPLY."
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

Every American is endowed with the God-given right to life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  Among the privileges are
the freedom to participate in the social, economic, political,
religious and cultural aspects of the community.  No wonder people
around the globe aspire to come to our shores!

<p>

Rights are important, but there are obligations crucial to
the survival of a free society.  Citizenship imposes broad responsibilities
on our nation, our community, our neighbors and our families.
One of the most cherished of these is the obligation to vote.
This democratic republic will survive only if it is truly representative
of all the people, and that requires broad participation in the
political process.

<p>

Sadly, far too few Christians go to the polls.  Abraham Lincoln
believed elections to be so important that he offered furloughs
to soldiers who wanted to vote. Edmund Burke said, &quot;All it
takes for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.&quot;
Now is not the time for any of us, whatever our heritage, to
lower the standards of good citizenship.  After all, we are men
and women <I>with</I> a country -- a country that needs us more
than ever.

<p>

&quot;<font size=+3>T</font>he Defense of Marriage Act is a powerful 
antidote to the destructive trend that has gripped this country at the 
hands of some injudicious judges.&quot; -- Gary Bauer, FRC president, 
before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on July 11, 1996.

<p>

On July 12, the House of Representatives approved the Defense
of Marriage Act (DOMA) by an overwhelming vote of 342 to 67.
The bill defines marriage for federal purposes as &quot;the union
of a man and a woman as husband and wife.&quot;  It also asserts
the power of Congress to interpret the Full Faith and Credit Clause
of the Constitution to protect the other 49 states if Hawaii legalizes
homosexual &quot;marriage&quot; as expected later this year.

<p>

<center><h3>Senate Action Soon</h3></center>

<p>

As of press time, DOMA was slated for Senate action before the
August 3 recess.  Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) has threatened
to attach an amendment to the bill that would grant homosexuals
special workplace protection.  This could kill DOMA, since the
Kennedy amendment is an unacceptable, back-door way of enacting
federal gay rights legislation.  Calls are needed to Capitol Hill
to urge legislators to &quot;pass DOMA pure.&quot;

<p>

The swift consideration of DOMA is testament to the hard work
of thousands of pro-family activists who have pressed Congress
to act.  FRC's government relations staff report that Capitol
Hill has been inundated with calls and letters supporting DOMA.

<p>

On June 24, leaders of 11 state family policy councils allied
with FRC and Focus on the Family spoke in support of DOMA at a
Washington press conference that drew national and regional press
coverage.

"URGE LEGISLATORS TO<br>
PASS DOMA PURE"
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

On July 3, FRC hosted a Capitol Hill briefing on DOMA with eight
experts who analyzed the faulty research on homosexuality and
addressed the importance of traditional marriage in law, culture,
education and adoption.  Speakers included author Dr. Jeffrey
Satinover,  Transformation Ex-Gay Ministry leader Anthony Falzarano,
Amherst Professor of Jurisprudence Hadley Arkes, FRC cultural
studies director Robert Knight, social work specialist Brenda
Destro, adoption expert Mary Beth Style, former school principal
and author Linda Page, journalist Peter LaBarbera, and Gary Bauer.

<p>

<center><h3>Briefing Highlights</h3></center>

<p>

The two-hour briefing ran live on C-SPAN, which repeated it three
times during the next two days.  Millions of Americans learned
facts about homosexuality and the homosexual political agenda
that are routinely omitted from media coverage.  Here are some
excerpts:

<p>

<b>Jeffrey Satinover, M.D.</b>, former Fellow in Psychiatry and Child
Psychiatry at Yale:  &quot;Two profoundly mistaken ideas have
sunk deeply into public sentiment where they exert a powerful
influence in the shaping of public policy as it relates to family,
sexuality and marriage.  1) Homosexuality is genetic, and that
consequently, 2) Homosexuality is unchangeable.  Neither idea
is true, and in fact there is a mountain of scientific evidence
to the contrary.&quot;

<p>

<b>Hadley Arkes</b>: &quot;Every argument for gay marriage is an argument
that would support polygamy.  The gay activists may not have the
remotest interest in promoting polygamy, but ... they have the
most profound interest...in discrediting the notion that marriage
finds its defining ground in 'nature.'  We can count on the fact
that there will be someone, somewhere, ready to press this issue
by raising a challenge in the court....&quot;

<p>

Anthony Falzarano: &quot;I speak to you today not just as an
observer of this movement, but as one of them.  I am a former
homosexual.  I lived that lifestyle from the time I was 17 until
I was 26.  I entered the gay lifestyle thinking that there really
wasn't any choice for me.  What I didn't realize is that although
I didn't choose to be homosexual, I did not have to be gay.  I
had a choice.... Many of us are sick and tired of a lifestyle
that initially seems very freeing but eventually puts us in all
kinds of bondage and eventually will kill us....&quot;

<h3>On the Hill</h3>

<p>

<b>Bill Emerson, RIP.</b>  A strong champion of the sanctity of
life and the family, Rep. Bill Emerson (Mo.) died of cancer June
22.  Emerson was universally admired by his colleagues and popular
with his constituents.  His public career was sparked by service
as a Congressional page at age 16.  The flag-waving families who
lined his funeral route and the members of Congress who paid him
tearful tribute during a July 12 memorial service offered praise
to his memory.  Emerson's quiet service was marked with integrity
and devotion.

<p>

<b>Istook Tries.</b> On July 11, the House passed the 1997 funding
bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and
Education. Defeated: a pro-family amendment offered by Rep.
Ernest Istook (R-Okla.) that would have required written parental
consent before a teenager receives any services, including abortion
referrals, under the Title X federal family planning program.
The House also defeated an attempt by Rep. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.)
that would have allowed federally-funded human embryo experiments.
Current law prohibits such research on live human embryos.

<p>

<b>Unaccountable.</b> The House and Senate passed separate health
reform bills last spring with bipartisan support, yet no compromise
has been reached.  Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) has been holding
the bill hostage by refusing to let the Senate leadership appoint
conferees.  Kennedy opposes medical savings accounts (MSAs), which
were contained in the House bill but narrowly defeated by the
Senate.  He has vowed to continue stalling until the leadership
appoints a majority of conferees opposed to MSAs. If Kennedy
succeeds, much-needed reforms (in access and ability to keep insurance
when changing jobs) will go by the boards.

<p>

<b>Jubilee Pits.</b> &quot;Come, Holy Spirit&quot; -- with those
words, Rep. Bob Dornan (R-Calif.) took the floor of Congress on
June 27 and defended his Christian faith, biblical sexual morality,
and FRC's role in exposing the homosexual &quot;circuit&quot;
party in a federal building in April. Dornan made the remarks
in response to a personal attack by fellow Rep. Steve Gunderson
(R-Wis.).  For a full transcript of Rep. Dornan's remarks as they
were printed in the <I>Congressional Record</I>, call 1-800-225-4008.

<p>

<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>

<p><a name="fdabortion">

<b>FDA Variety Store.</b> In a highly unusual move, the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) Reproductive Drug Advisory Committee
initiated hearings on two new abortion drugs -- hearings not solicited
by a drug manufacturer.  On June 28, the FDA committee decided
that increased dosages of oral contraceptives were &quot;safe&quot;
and &quot;effective&quot; for use as an abortifacient &quot;morning-after
pill.&quot;  Pro-abortion groups urged the FDA to force reluctant
manufacturers to relabel oral contraceptives for post-coital use.
On July 19, the same FDA committee considered approving RU-486
for use in the US.  FRC attended both hearings and  publicly opposed
both FDA actions.

<p>

<b>China MFN.</b> The Clinton administration prevailed in renewing
China's &quot;most favored nation&quot; (MFN) trade status for
the coming year.  On June 27, an effort to revoke China's MFN
status failed in the House of Representatives by vote of 141 to
286.  However, the House did pass a second, non-binding resolution
(H. Res. 461 by vote of 411 to 7) which called for hearings and
possible legislation to punish China for its military intimidation
of Taiwan, weapons sales, and human rights abuses.  FRC supports
hearings and opposes MFN for China because of its myriad human
rights abuses.

<p>

<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>

<p>

<b>Five-ring Political Circus.</b> The 1996 Olympics in Atlanta
were, sadly, misused to advance the homosexual agenda.  The Olympic
torch run bypassed Cobb County, Georgia, and Greenville County,
South Carolina, because officials there passed resolutions opposing
homosexuality.  The torch was actually hidden in a van and driven
through Greenville County during the night.  Meanwhile, the Clinton
administration lifted the ban on HIV-infected immigrants for the
Olympics, just as was done earlier for the Gay Games in New York.
It's not known whether other infectious diseases got equal opportunity.

<p>

<b>First Advocate.</b> In a first-ever presidential interview
with a homosexual magazine, President Clinton told <I>The Advocate</I>
(June 25) that his administration &quot;has taken more steps than
any previous in bringing the gay and lesbian communities to the
table.&quot;  Los Angeles-based Liberation Publications, which
publishes <I>The Advocate</I>, also owns Alyson Publications,
a Boston-based publisher of <I>Heather Has Two Mommies, Daddy's
Roommate, Daddy's Wedding</I> and books about sado-masochistic
sex with children.  One book gives advice for homosexual pedophiles
on how to avoid prosecution.

<p><a name="marijuana">

<b>MUM's Not the Word.</b> California's &quot;Medical Use of
Marijuana&quot; initiative will appear on the November ballot.
International &quot;decriminalization&quot; promoters who have
bankrolled this initiative claim it will provide &quot;compassionate
use&quot; of marijuana without prescription for people with cancer,
AIDS and glaucoma, but the initiative allows use for &quot;any
other illness&quot; and would virtually legalize possession and
cultivation for anyone, including children.  The federal government
rejects smoking marijuana as a medicine because it has serious
physical and psychological consequences.  Physicians wishing to
prescribe THC, marijuana's active ingredient, have the FDA-approved
drug Marinol.

<h3>FRC: Ready and <i>Abel</i></h3>

<p>

The Supreme Court will decide this September whether to hear the
first challenge to the Pentagon's new ban on homosexuals in the
military.  This appeal was prompted by the high court's recent
ruling that Colorado cannot constitutionally bar &quot;special
rights&quot; laws for homosexuals.

<p>

On July 1, 1996, former Navy Lieutenant Paul Thomasson, who was
discharged for proclaiming, &quot;I am gay,&quot; asked the high
court to hear his case.  He challenged both the law passed by
Congress and the Clinton administration's regulations on homosexuality
in the armed forces.

<p>

Thomasson lost his challenge in both the federal district and
appeals courts.  The appeals court hearing was noteworthy because
it included oral argument presented on behalf of the Family Research
Council.  FRC had filed two briefs in this case, both of which
thoroughly exposed the administration's illegal plans to use the
military to legitimize homosexuality.

<p>

Thomasson's attorney said his appeal decision was influenced by
the high court's <I>Romer v. Evans</I> ruling, which struck
down Colorado's &quot;special rights&quot; amendment.  He claims
that the judicial landscape has improved greatly with <I>Romer</I>.
Writing for the Supreme Court's minority in the <I>Romer</I>
decision, Justice Antonin Scalia said there is &quot;no foundation
in American constitutional law&quot; for the court's ruling.

<p>

It's expected the Clinton Justice Department will favor the appeal
request.  If the court accepts <I>Thomasson</I>, oral arguments
will likely be held this fall with a decision next spring.  The
military's ban should be upheld -- if the Supreme Court relies
on the constitution.

<p>

FRC's Military Readiness Project (MRP) has participated in 12
homosexual court cases so far.  Should the <I>Thomasson</I> case
be heard, the MRP will file an amicus brief and ask the high court
for time to make oral argument.

<p>

Meanwhile, also on July 1, 1996, the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit returned the <I>Abel et al. v. Perry</I> case
to federal district court directing that judge to determine whether
the military can constitutionally exclude soldiers who engage
in homosexual conduct.  The lower court previously ruled that
the First and Fifth Amendment rights of the six service members
in <I>Abel</I> were violated when the military sought to discharge
them based solely on their <I>admission</I> of homosexuality,
without regard to actual conduct.

<h3>Ban the Postcards!</h3>

<p>

The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act passed the House of Representatives
and the Senate and was vetoed by President Clinton on April 10,
1996.  The House will first attempt to override the President's
veto shortly after Labor Day. A two-thirds majority of those
present and voting is required to override.  If the House vote
is successful, the Senate is expected to make an override attempt
shortly thereafter. These are crucial pro-life votes.

<p>

On June 29-30, the nation's Catholic bishops sponsored a massive
pro-life postcard campaign (in local churches) to members of Congress
to urge support for the override.  It is expected that millions
of postcards will flood Capitol Hill in the next month or two.
The House Post Office has reportedly hired extra workers to deal
with the heavy influx of cards.

<p>

The Clinton White House is not waiting for the cards to react,
however. Administration officials at the Pentagon attempted to 
silence Catholic chaplains on military bases by issuing a directive 
forbidding them to mention the postcard campaign in church. They 
claimed it involved &quot;partisan political activity,&quot; a 
claim belied by the fact that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban was 
passed overwhelmingly by bipartisan majorities in both houses of 
Congress.  Many Catholic service members and their families believe 
that they were illegally denied the guidance of their priests and 
bishops on this vital issue. A legal defense fund which specializes 
in religious liberty cases is reportedly planning to file suit on 
behalf of military chaplains who believe that their First Amendment 
rights were violated.

<p>

FRC urges concerned citizens to call on their legislators to override
the veto by talking with them personally, especially at local
&quot;town meetings&quot; during the August congressional recess.
Calls and/or letters to the members' district offices are also
encouraged.  Please continue to educate your friends and neighbors
about partial-birth abortions by writing &quot;letters to the
editor&quot; to local newspapers, participating in radio talk
shows, etc.

<font size=+2><b><i>The Court's Conscientious Dissenter</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer
</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>J</font>ustice Antonin Scalia is making a name for himself 
as a conscientious objector to a Supreme Court run amok.  He is heard 
most often from the dissenting side these days, frequently accompanied 
by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Associate Justice Clarence Thomas.
His dissents are noteworthy -- some would say notorious.  Justice
Scalia has an uncanny knack for cutting through the majority's
sophistry and sloppy self-justification to make a stunning legal
defense of American tradition, true democracy, plain old common
sense and decency.

<p>

Scalia shines the light of truth on &quot;this most illiberal
Court, which has embarked on a course of inscribing one after
another of the current preferences of the society (and in some
cases only the counter-majoritarian preferences of the society's
law trained elite) into our Basic Law.&quot;  He believes that
it is &quot;no business of the courts (as opposed to the political
branches) to take sides in the cultural war.&quot;  We at FRC
believe the same, and Scalia's measured umbrage is our vicarious
voice.

<p>

In response to special rights gained by the well-funded gay lobby
in several Colorado cities, voters across the state approved a
constitutional amendment that would prevent any person from getting
such legal privileges solely on the basis of their homosexuality.
The Court majority said that the amendment was unconstitutional
because it was obviously born of hatred against gays, despite
what the Coloradans say.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>
THE COURT UNASHAMEDLY<br>
OVERSTEPS ITS AUTHORITY.
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

Scalia retorted that &quot;[t]he Court's portrayal of Coloradans
as a society fallen victim to pointless, hate-filled 'gay-bashing'
is so false as to be comical.&quot;  He also deplored the sinister
effect of the Court's &quot;verbally disparaging as bigotry adherence
to traditional attitudes.&quot;  Scalia charged the majority with
&quot;tak[ing] sides in the culture wars,&quot; specifically,
choosing &quot;the views and values of the lawyer class from which
the Court's Members are drawn&quot; and supporting this choice
&quot;by inventing a novel and extravagant constitutional doctrine.&quot;

<p>

The Court unashamedly overstepped its authority, he wrote: &quot;Amendment
2 is designed to prevent piecemeal deterioration of the sexual
morality favored by a majority of Coloradans, and is not only
an appropriate means to that legitimate end, but a means that
Americans have employed before.  Striking it down is an act, not
of judicial judgment, but of political will.&quot;

<p>

Scalia took up his pen again in the case challenging the male-only
admissions policy at the Virginia Military Institute:  &quot;Since
it is entirely clear that the Constitution of the United States
-- the old one -- takes no sides in this educational debate, I
dissent....Today the Court shuts down an institution that has
served the people of the Commonwealth of Virginia with pride and
distinction for over a century and a half.&quot;  To do that,
it &quot;sweeps aside the precedents of this Court, and ignores
the history of our people.&quot;

<p>

In one of the last cases of the term, Justice Scalia rhetorically
shook his head: &quot;The court must be living in another world.
Day by day, case by case, it is busy designing a Constitution
for a country I do not recognize.&quot;

<p>

Those are stark words from the bench, words befitting the steady
dismantling of legislative prerogatives today's &quot;conservative&quot;
Supreme Court is engaged in.  But Scalia is no doomsayer.  A recent
report of a celebration of his first 10 years on the bench with
his present and former law clerks noted that, despite his angry
dissents, Justice Scalia is a happy man with a sense of hope.
Apparently he knows, as we know, that ours is not in the winning,
but in the trying.

Dear Cleta:

     I live in Maryland and my congresswoman is Connie 
Morella.  She voted against term limits and other significant 
items in the Contract with America.  Everyone says she is 
unbeatable. Is that true and is there anything I can do to mount 
a campaign against her?

                     Taxed but not represented in Maryland
</pre>
<p>

Dear Taxed:
<p>
<dd>You're right.  Connie Morella is disgusting.  She votes wrong on most things.  I know, because she's my congresswoman, too...  Here are some suggestions if you are serious about replacing her:
<p>
<dd>First, this is a long term proposition -- it isn't going to be done overnight.  It will take at least 18 months of planning a campaign to get rid of her, and it might take two election cycles of intense effort.  It is difficult to get rid of an incumbent member of Congress without an infusion of major dollars and assistance like the labor unions are presently pouring into beating up on some of the freshmen.
<p>
<dd>Second, a small group of 5 to 10 people, dedicated to ridding the Congress of Rep. Morella should begin meeting monthly through the end of this year.  Who should come to the meeting?  People with a sincere desire to beat Connie Morella -- and at least one or two people who have been involved in politics in some form prior to this effort. The information at the meeting should include a map of the district and the voting patterns in both the GOP and Democratic primaries as well as the general elections from the past 3 cycles.  
<p>
<dd>Third, form some task forces: research (to gather information about her record); candidate recruitment (to develop a list of possible opponents for Rep. Morella); third, outreach (to develop a plan for broadening the circle of activists plotting her overthrow); fourth, finance (you can't do this for free).
<p>
<dd>Watch the fall campaign carefully and continue to meet monthly through December.  By then, you should have complete research on her record through this Congress and a sense of what it's going to take to beat her in two years.  When you've got that all assembled, write me again and we'll go from there.  
<p>
<dd>This is a good project.  I hope you'll do it.

<center><h1>A NATION MOURNS</h1></center>

<p>

<font size=+3>O</font>n April 10, President Bill Clinton vetoed the 
Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act (PBA).  With a stroke of his pen, Clinton 
continued to authorize abortion on demand, leaving to the abortionist 
the gruesome method of his choice.

<p>

And gruesome it is. In a partial-birth abortion, a child between
five and nine months of gestation is delivered -- all but the head --
and living brain tissue is vacuumed out after the child is stabbed
at the base of the skull with surgical scissors.  A top physician
testified before Congress that babies subjected to this process
most certainly feel pain.  Strangely, if a &quot;mistake&quot;
were made and the child slipped out of the mother, he would be
legally human and fully protected from being killed.

<p>

<center><h3>Broad Support</h3></center>

<p>

The brutality of this technique seemed capable of delivering a
first -- the first federal restriction of abortion since the 1973
<I>Roe v. Wade</I> Supreme Court decision.  In fact, Rep. Patricia
Schroeder (D-Colo.) fought to keep pictorials of the procedure
off the House floor, but the pro-life side carried the day, winning
the votes of House and Senate members who had never cast a pro-life
vote in their careers.  Winning margins in the House were 288-139
and 286-129, and in the Senate, 54-44.

<p>

When the bill went to the White House on Good Friday, it included
an exception allowing the procedure if necessary to save a mother
whose life &quot;is endangered by a physical disorder, illness
or injury.&quot;  The bill also received important symbolic support.
Many national leaders called for the President to approve it,
including liberal columnists and prominent clergy.  Several Catholic
bishops, including two cardinals, endured a soaking rain on April
1 to pray outside the White House.

<p>

When Bill Clinton vetoed the bill, beside him stood five women
who had experienced troubled pregnancies.  The setting was designed
to suggest that PBA had been the only answer to their trauma.

<p>

But it was not even clear that the women beside him had undergone
PBA, according to transcripts of the President's remarks and
media accounts.  The President said, &quot;The emotional power
of the description of the procedure -- which I might add did not
cover the procedure these women had ... was so great ...&quot;
He also cited the bill's omission of an exception for the &quot;health&quot;
of the mother -- a term defined so broadly by the courts that, PBA
supporters say, it means unrestricted abortion.

<p>

<center><h3>Feeling Pain</h3></center>

<p>

Many myths have been reported as fact in the PBA debate.  Among
the cruelest is that anesthesia kills the baby before the procedure
is carried out, a falsehood that, dangerously, only scares many
pregnant mothers needing legitimate surgery.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>
MANY MYTHS HAVE BEEN<br>
REPORTED AS FACT.
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

The decision on whether to attempt an override of the President's
veto rests first with the House leadership.  Since PBA began in
the House, the vetoed bill has been returned there.  If two-thirds
of the House votes to override the veto (a margin previously achieved),
then it would go to the Senate. The initial vote in the Senate
was short of the two-thirds margin needed for adoption.

<p>

The veto comes at a time when recent polls show that more than
two-thirds of Americans support either restrictions on abortion
or an end to PBA altogether.

<p>

&quot;I am among the majority of Americans who know that our nation
has more to offer than abortion,&quot; Family Research Council
President Gary L. Bauer said.  &quot;This is a time for us to
pray for the return of a respect for life, born out of our Judeo-Christian
heritage and honored by our nation's founders.  Our future depends
on it.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>What You Can Do</h3></center>

<p>

Write your member of Congress and two senators and urge them to
continue to press for enactment of the PBA.  Write or call FRC
(1-800-225-4008) and obtain a copy of our free packet (PK033) 
describing the truth about PBA's and the need
for federal legislation.  Thomas Jefferson once said that he trembled
for his country when he reflected that God is just.  A nation
that will not protect children (and mothers) at the very threshold
of birth has reason to tremble -- and to mourn.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>

<p>

<b>Omnibus Riders.</b> A new omnibus spending bill (H.R. 3019)
may include several pro-family provisions.  The Coats amendment,
which passed the Senate 63-37, would protect medical schools from
losing federal funds if they ignore an abortion mandate issued
by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. 
The mandate requires medical students specializing in obstetrics
to be trained in performing elective abortions.  House and Senate
conferees on the bill are also expected to maintain restrictions
on District of Columbia abortion funding and on international
population assistance to groups that perform elective abortions.

<p>

<b>Health Savings.</b> The House recently passed a health reform
bill (H.R. 3103) by a vote of 267-151.  FRC supported the bill,
which includes 100 percent tax-free medical savings accounts for
families and individuals.  MSA's allow working families to choose
their own doctors and make their own health care spending decisions.
An amendment by Sen. Robert Dole to include MSA's in the Senate
bill, cosponsored by Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.) and Ted Kennedy
(D-Mass.), was defeated, 52-46, under a veto threat from President
Clinton if MSA's were adopted.

<p>

<b>Et Tu, Newt?</b> House Speaker Newt Gingrich gave a speech
on March 24 endorsing a candlelight AIDS march that benefits pro-homosexual
organizations. Among them are the Whitman-Walker Clinic, which
treats AIDS victims but also runs homosexual activist workshops,
promotes lesbian parenting, and places &quot;safe sex&quot; ads
in a Washington homosexual newspaper that promotes strip clubs
and bathhouses.  The newspaper noted that Gingrich credited Rep.
Steve Gunderson (R-Wis.) for asking him to publicize the march.
Gingrich also credited Gunderson's homosexual partner.

<p>

<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>

<p><a name="fda">

<b>Rubber Stamp.</b> After experimenting on 2,100 pregnant American
women, the Population Council recently filed a petition with
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to request approval for
the abortion drug, RU 486. FDA Commissioner David Kessler had
earlier suggested that the FDA would put RU-486 on a fast-track
review process, perhaps approving the drug within six months.
FRC condemns any action by the FDA that would legitimize, for
the first time ever, a drug that would have no other use except
to kill innocent human life.

<p>

<b>Fostering Failure.</b> Dr. Henry Foster, head of a new Presidential
teen pregnancy task force, appeared with several pro-teen contraceptive
advocates at an April 10 Capitol Hill briefing.  The panelists
criticized abstinence-only programs, despite their proven effectiveness
in reducing teenage sexual activity and sexually transmitted diseases.
The panelists stressed instead more vigorous sex education programs,
increased use of contraception, and self-esteem programs. A hand-out
they distributed claimed that &quot;abstinence until marriage&quot;
programs and programs to produce &quot;secondary virginity&quot;
have not been shown to work.

<p>

<b>MIT Saber-Rattling.</b> On March 20, a Massachusetts Institute
of Technology faculty task force announced that it wants to open
the college's Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) program to
avowed homosexuals.  The task force encourages universities nationwide
to rethink their relationship with the ROTC and their adherence
to its homosexual policy. MIT risks losing $56 million, 16 percent
of its annual research budget, because of a 1996 law that denies
Pentagon dollars to any institution that has an anti-ROTC policy.
Last year, ROTC commissioned 7,200 officers, barely reaching
the Pentagon's goal.

<p>

<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>

<p><a name="marriage">

<b>States of Matrimony.</b> Kansas has become the fifth state
to enact a law protecting marriage, joining Hawaii, Utah, South
Dakota and Georgia.  Other states are also acting against an expected
Hawaiian court ruling that may legalize homosexual &quot;marriage&quot;
licenses, which could then be imposed on other states under the
Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution.  In Hawaii,
the Senate also voted 24-0 specifically to ban same-sex 
&quot;marriage.&quot; The vote boosts the state's case in the suit 
brought by three homosexual couples that triggered the controversy.

<p>

<b>Ornery.</b> The Republican and Democratic political establishments
were both thwarted by insurgent candidacies in the April 9 Texas
primary runoff.  Former Congressman Ron Paul beat incumbent Republican
Greg Laughlin, a recent party-switcher.  House Speaker Newt Gingrich
was among those who campaigned vigorously for Laughlin. Both
candidates had vied for the support of pro-family activists.  In
the Democratic race for U.S. Senate, school teacher Victor Morales
defeated veteran Congressman John Bryant despite Bryant's support
from former Gov. Ann Richards and labor unions, including the
Texas Federation of Teachers.

<p>

<b>Revisionists Revise.</b> Revisionist historians missed the
U.S. landing on the moon and the presidency of George Washington
in their first, politically correct attempt back in 1994 to devise
national history standards. Now the latest revision, just released,
re-defines the family as &quot;a group of people from whom we receive
love and support.&quot;  The standards also endorse President
Clinton's embattled Goals 2000 plan and, for good measure, put
in a plug for equalized school funding nationwide.  Some conservative
critics were assuaged, but the standards remain a biased political
document.

<h3>Implementing Beijing</h3>

<p>

Despite the fact that most women in the world marry and have
children at some point in their lives, the family remained a non-issue
at the 40th session of the United Nations Commission on the Status
of Women (CSW) which met in New York in mid-March.  The CSW is
planning the implementation of the Platform for Action of last
autumn's Beijing Women's Conference.

<p>

There was no statement at the session that the family had
value, no effort to protect or shore it up now that it is under
siege, not even an invocation of the UN's usual definition of
the family as &quot;the basic unit of society.&quot; 

<p>

Most of the meeting revolved about the issues of &quot;women
and poverty&quot; and &quot;women and child and dependent care.&quot;
Noting that women constitute the majority of the world's poor,
the Commission urged governments to undertake education and training
programs and to adopt legislation promoting women's rights to
inheritance, land ownership and political decision-making.  The
&quot;dependent care&quot; debate urged redistribution of responsibilities
in the home and more part-time work, child care services and elder
care.

<p>

The session ended with the adoption of strong resolutions
condemning traffic in women and girls (a growing problem especially
in some developing countries) and wartime violence against civilians.
The Commission also approved the UN's System-Wide Plan of Action
(known as SWIMTEP) for implementing the Beijing Platform, including
its controversial provisions for health and &quot;reproductive
rights,&quot; which many UN advocacy groups hold to include abortion
and contraceptive programs for girls.

<p>

Among the tasks which SWIMTEP assigned regarding reproductive
rights were: a directive for the World Health Organization (WHO),
UNICEF and UNESCO to report on promotion of these rights to the
UN Population Division; a directive to the WHO 
and the UN Fund for Population to provide governments with technical
guidelines on methods of family planning and community distribution
of contraceptives; and a directive to UN agencies to provide special
programs for youth regarding sexual behavior.  (These directives
make no mention of parental rights or the influence of religious
or ethical traditions.)

<h3>FRC's Day in Court</h3>

<p>

On April 5, FRC received good news from a federal appeals
court in a pace-setting military homosexual case, <I>Thomasson
v. Perry</I>.  In this case, a homosexual sailor challenged both
the law passed by Congress and the Clinton administration regulations
on homosexuality in the armed forces.

<p>

The full court of 13 judges heard oral argument in December,
including argument presented by FRC's Military Readiness Project.
The MRP had filed two briefs in this case, both of which thoroughly
exposed the administration's failure to implement the law.

<p>

The law Congress passed is very clear:  no homosexuals in
the military.  But this binding expression of the will of the
American people has not stopped the administration from creating
regulatory loopholes through which homosexuals not only could
serve, but could serve openly in the military.

<p>

In <I>Thomasson,</I> the majority federal judges said, &quot;no
way.&quot; They cited FRC by name as they ruled that the Clinton
regulations on homosexuals are invalid.  The judges declared that
the administration deliberately mischaracterized the law and deliberately
shaded its answers to Congress when concerned members tried to
pin down exactly how the White House was implementing the new
statute.

<p>

Meanwhile,  the MRP was in court April 8 to hear <I>Richenberg
v. Perry</I>, a federal appeals case involving a homosexual Air
Force officer.   Predictably, the government mischaracterized
the law, but for the first time a government lawyer spoke of the
increased risk of AIDS posed by homosexuals serving.

<p>

Government counsel quoted a gay activist, &quot;I didn't
fight all my life to remain celibate&quot; and used an illustration.
If an airman identifies himself as an F16 pilot, can't the military
reasonably infer that he flies?  The counsel said the military
excludes homosexuals for a similar reason.  After all, soldiers
who identify themselves as homosexuals will engage in illicit
behavior. The court in <I>Thomasson</I> found this logic compelling.

<font size=+2><b><i>The &quot;Big Blue&quot; Summit</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer
</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>&quot;A</font>t the end of today, give me your badge, your 
desk key and everything that belongs to IBM,&quot; Charlene Mitchell
remembers her manager saying to her.  &quot;Go home and don't
come back.&quot;  Mrs. Mitchell told <I>The Washington Post</I>
how she was &quot;surplused&quot; in 1993 by the computer giant,
known for decades as &quot;Big Blue.&quot;  It was a bitter pill
for Mrs. Mitchell to swallow.  She was the third generation in
her family to work for IBM.

<p>

Charlene Mitchell was just one of 12,500 layoffs by IBM in
the Washington area since 1987.  Nationally, more than 3.2 million
Americans have gotten pink slips from large multinational corporations
over a recent six-year period.  Many layoffs are inevitable, of
course, but controversial firing practices have become &quot;business
as usual&quot; under the leadership of a new crop of corporate
high-rollers.

<p>

IBM's chief, Lou Gerstner, Jr, bluntly told the nation's
governors in 1995 that they should &quot;confront and expel&quot;
anyone they saw as a barrier to achievement of the national education
goals. He invited them to a summit last month at IBM's New York
conference center:  &quot;We'll pull it all together,&quot; he
said.  Pull it he did.  Gerstner ruled discussion of parental
choice out of order, even though he conceded that the &quot;public
education system is broken.&quot;

<p>

Gerstner clashed with Gov. George Allen (R-Va.) behind closed
doors when the conservative opposed national curricula and national
tests.  How could Gerstner force the governors to accept his edicts?
He pointedly reminded them and the press that IBM is already
the largest employer in North Carolina and Vermont.  He enlisted
other corporate bigs into making the same threat: reform our
way or face a hiring boycott of your states.

<p>

It's ironic to be battling over education standards now.
Pro-family conservatives were among the first recruits for the
education reform movement of the 1980's.  We cheered when my boss,
Bill Bennett, called for &quot;Content, Character and Choice.&quot;
We battled the &quot;dumbing down&quot; of American education.
We wanted teachers who can teach and school curricula that emphasize
the basics:  reading, writing, math, history and reliable standards
of right and wrong.  Instead, we've seen the education reform
movement hijacked by people who have given such &quot;triumphs&quot;
as vague, behavioral Outcome-Based Education (OBE) and anti-American
history standards.

<p>

Nobody has greater concern for the future economic success
of America's young graduates than their own parents.  But it's
a mistake to look at education as just a matter of work force
preparation. Education is primarily about family, faith
and freedom.  It must pass on the heritage of Western Civilization.
When we concentrate on basics, when we respect parents' rights
and the authority of locally elected school boards, excellence
will follow.

<p>

One corporate executive at the IBM summit admitted as much.
He described his state of New Hampshire. They still have New
England town meetings to discuss school issues, he said, and parents
are actively engaged in their children's education.  The result:
top scores for New Hampshire kids on national tests, even though
the state spends very little per pupil.

I like the New Hampshire model, not the German model that
is increasingly put forward by Marc Tucker, a liberal education
theorist and close associate of Hillary and Bill Clinton.  In
the same issue of <I>Newsweek</I> (April 8) where Jonathan Alter
touted the German model for education and job training, the magazine's
&quot;Business&quot; section reported a German unemployment rate
twice ours. Mercedes-Benz is building factories outside Germany
for the first time in its history.  There is serious division
in German society -- East-West splits, anti-immigrant violence,
and skinhead, directionless youth.

<p>

We can have excellent schools if we respect parental rights,
institute parental choice and uphold our free institutions.  We
should not try to make our kids over in anyone else's image: 
Let Americans be Americans!

This month marks a departure from the usual format of <i>Washington Watch</i>. While most families are beginning summer vacations from school, Congress is entering the heart of its regular legislative schedule.  This special issue of <i>Watch</i> is designed to bring you up to date on what FRC regards as the most important pro-family policy measures pending on Capitol Hill.
<p>
On the inside pages, you'll find a convenient "scorecard" on the legislative achievements of the 104th Congress.  You may want to keep a copy handy for future reference.  Feel free to duplicate copies of these pages as you see fit for your neighbors or your church.
Bulk copies of this issue of <i>Watch</i> are available on request.  Just dial 1-800-225-4008 for information.
<p>
And remember -- for current pro-family legislative information, updated every Friday, dial FRC at 1-202-783-HOME (a toll call).
<p>
<i>Watch</i> will return in its regular format in July.  In the meantime, drop me a note and let me know how well <i>Washington Watch</i> is serving your need for timely facts and findings about how the family fares in national policy. 
<p><hr width=50% size=3><p>
<font size=+2><b><i>Dear Reader:</i></b></font>
<p>Late last year, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> asked me to write an essay on what pro-family Americans expected from the new Congress.  I was happy to do so, even though I had to begin my article with a concession.  The concession was this:  the new Congress should keep the promises made in the Republican Contract with America -- most of which involved economic and structural reforms -- then turn to the social agenda:  reversing the breakdown of the family, defunding our grossly mismanaged (and too often simply gross) arts agencies, protecting the sanctity of human life, reforming the education mess.
<p>
In the last four months, the pro-family movement has helped to implement a lot of reforms related to the budget and the economy.  Now it's time to deal with issues related to our families and values.  Patience may be its own reward, but in public policy, too much patience can be poison.  In my two decades in Washington, I have witnessed only a handful of opportunities for progress on a pro-family platform.  We are now in the midst of such an opportunity.  We can move forward and see dramatic policy change to strengthen the family unit morally, socially and economically.
<p>
Or we can see the opposite.  Because just as this opportunity is upon us, so too is there unprecedented danger to the family.  Every parent in America senses this fact.  To read a daily newspaper is to be bombarded with a hail of horrors.  To look at our nation's illegitimacy rate -- and to understand its correlation with youth crime -- is to recognize that America may be just a decade away from an explosion of street violence.  To see the staggering toll of abortions, the pressures on our court system to sanction euthanasia and assisted suicide, and other anti-life trends, is to know that the nation is perilously close to complete dissolution of the Judeo-Christian consensus that has sustained it through the centuries.
<p>
A wise veteran on Capitol Hill put our situation to me bluntly.  For the first time since it has been his job to understand the pulse of the American people, he cannot tell which way this nation is headed.  In the next five years, he said, anything seems possible, from a religious and pro-family renaissance to an utter collapse of traditional values that brings on drug legalization, homosexual marriages, and all-pervasive pornography.  
<p>
Life and death truly have been set before us.  Which way we will choose?  What follows in this special edition of <i>Washington Watch</i> is an effort to lay out an agenda for <i>the way of life</i> -- an American way of life.  My hope is that you will share these pages with your friends, your neighbors and those with whom you attend church.  Each of us has the responsibility to take a clear look at the alternatives that lie before us -- before the window of opportunity is shut.

<p>
<i>Introduction:  The architecture of family freedom is no accident, even if, once upon a time in America, government officials almost instinctively adopted policies to protect family stability and promote civic character.  Today, both deliberate and unintentional assaults upon the family have multiplied.  But the structure of the family is written on the heart of humanity.  Lawmakers can ignore that God-given structure, but they cannot erase it.  Here are ways that the 104th Congress can help to restore family-friendly public policy</i>.
<p>
<a name="life"><center><h3>Restoring the Sanctity of Human Life</h3></center>
<p>
<b>1. The Civil Right to Life.</b> Four members of the House, two Democrats and two Republicans, have introduced constitutional amendments to restore the right to life of children before birth.  Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) has introduced S. 320, the "Unborn Children's Civil Rights Act."  It would put Congress on record as declaring, among other things, that the U.S. Constitution sanctions no right to abortion and that <i>Roe v. Wade</i> was improperly decided.  It would also bar any federal funding or promotion of abortion, and provide for an expedited right of appeal to the Supreme Court when any abortion restriction is found unconstitutional by a lower court.  These proposals do not merely "modify" the abortion right, they would give protection to unborn children for the first time in 22 years.
<p>
<b>2. Members Against Dismemberment</b>. As a first step toward providing constitutional protection for unborn children, Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.) and Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) will offer legislation to ban "partial birth abortions," which involve the heinous D&X procedure performed on unborn children 20-26 weeks of gestation.  Hearings are scheduled this month in the House Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on the Constitution.
<p>
<b>3. "Lady Liberty" Means No to Forced Abortions.</b> The Clinton administration has shown blatant disregard for fundamental human rights by overturning previous administrations' asylum policy for families fleeing China's coercive "birth quota" system, with its forced abortions and sterilizations.  Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) recently attached language to the foreign aid bill (H.R. 1561) to restore the previous policy.  By record vote of  240-181 on the same bill, the House voted to deny U.S. foreign assistance dollars to non-governmental groups that perform or provide abortions, or that lobby other nations to repeal their laws restricting abortion.  The same measure would also require the United Nations Population Fund to end its involvement in China's draconian family planning program -- or lose all U.S. funds.  H.R. 1561 should pass the House as is, and the Senate should agree.
<p>
<b>4. Adopt Adoption Assistance.</b> In an effort to encourage adoption by lowering financial obstacles, the House of Representatives has passed a budget provision which allows taxpayers a $5,000 credit for qualified adoption expenses.  The Senate did not include the adoption assistance measure in their budget measure, passed on May 25.  An amendment offered by Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) that included the credit was defeated on May 23 by vote of 69-31.  The differing budgets now go to a House-Senate conference, and FRC will be working to ensure that the adoption credit survives in the final bill.  Adoption is the <i>option of choice</i> for dealing with crisis pregnancy.
<p>
<b>5. No Abortion Mandate</b>. Rep. Pete Hoekstra (R-Mich.) will introduce legislation to prohibit the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) from requiring hospital ob/gyn residency programs (including religious hospitals) to train or refer medical students to perform abortions, lest they lose accreditation.  At stake are federal  Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement dollars.  Subcommittee chairman Hoekstra also scheduled a June 14  hearing in the House Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee to examine ACGME's coercive policy.
<p>
<a name="education"><center><h3>Empower Parents for Education</h3></center>
<p>
<b>6. Be True to Our Schools.</b> At last, serious efforts are under way to dismantle the U.S. Education Department.  The House budget resolution withdraws funding for the department.  In addition, the House Education Task Force's "Back to the Basics Education Bill" returns authority to the state and local level.  This is a high-priority issue for FRC; action could come in Congress within several months.  The decline in American education parallels the rise of the Department of Education; it's time to test the linkage in reverse.
<p>
<b>7. Be True II.</b> The House has taken one small swipe at Goals 2000, the omnibus education legislation that transferred unprecedented education authority from localities to Washington, D.C.  Last month, the House passed H.R. 1045, which would eliminate NESIC, the equivalent of a national school board set up by the law.  Congress should now repeal <i>all</i> of the intrusive programs instituted by Goals 2000.  Kudos to Rep. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who has raised the issue in the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee, and to Gov. George Allen of Virginia, who has refused to accept Goals 2000 funding for his state.  We have to free our children from the control of the national education bureaucrats and their allies at the National Education Association.
<p>
<a name="purse"><center><h3>Protect the Family Purse</h3></center>
<p>
<b>8. Pro-child Tax Credits.</b> The $500-per-child tax credit helps relieve the tax burden on American families.  The House of Representatives has passed a tax bill that includes the $500-per-child credit and has also included it in its budget resolution.  Unfortunately, the credit's fate in the Senate is uncertain:  key Republican senators are raising doubts about the bill, and the Senate budget resolution passed on May 25 omitted it.  The Senate should change course and act to protect the family budget as it works to fix the federal budget.
<p>
<b>9. Don't Forget Health Reform.</b> Rep. Bill Archer (R-Tex.) has drafted legislation, not yet introduced, to change the income tax code to permit individual Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs).  These MSAs would give individuals and families greater control over their health care decisions, resulting in your family having coverage even if you change jobs, decreased costs, and broadened access to health care services.  FRC has joined a coalition of pro-family groups to promote such legislation.  The effort in 1994 to turn over health care to the government -- socialized medicine -- was defeated.  Sound reform is more critical now than ever.
<p>
<a name="wilderness"><center><h3>Tame the Cultural Wilderness</h3></center>
<p>
<b>10. Ban Homosexuality in Uniform.</b> Most Americans thought the military homosexual issue was resolved when Congress passed a reform bill in 1993.  Wrong.  The Clinton administration ignored the text of the law when it wrote the implementing regulations, effectively lifting the ban anyway.  Now the administration is using the federal courts to get around public opinion and scuttle the ban by building a losing case in the Supreme Court.  New legislation is imperative.  None is pending, but FRC's Military Readiness Project, with senior advisers former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Thomas Moorer and former Marine Corps Commandant Robert Barrow, is seeking Congressional support for appropriate amendments to the 1996 Defense Authorization Act.
<p>
<b>11. Porn-Free Cable TV.</b> With the encouragement of FRC, Reps. Tony Hall (D-Ohio) and Chris Smith (R-N.J.) have introduced legislation that would require cable TV operators to provide basic cable packages free of pornography.  Meanwhile, pro-family groups are working on alternatives to Sen. Jim Exon's (D-Neb.) Communications Decency Act of 1995, S. 314.   Exon's bill is a well-intentioned attempt to restrict transmission of pornography via computer, but may actually make it more difficult to prosecute.
<p>
<b>12. Porn-Free PXs</b>. Under current policy, military exchange managers are responsible to select magazines based on sales volume, customer preferences, and, in the case of pornographic material, whether or not it fits the definition of "obscenity" outlined in the 1973 Supreme Court case of <i>Miller v. California</i>.  The services oppose removing so-called "soft-core" pornography from exchange shelves because of the threat of legal action from the ACLU.  President Clinton has the unilateral authority to remove pornographic material from military stores.  He should do so, and Congress should adopt a resolution urging that action upon him.
<p>
<a name="misguided"><center><h3>Reform Misguided Federal Programs</h3></center>
<p>
<b>13. True Welfare Reform.</b> The full Senate should vote on a measure to restore the anti-illegitimacy provisions that were adopted by the House but then eliminated by the Senate Finance Committee on May 25.  The critical provisions are:  a restriction on federally funded cash benefits for adolescent unwed mothers; a "cap" on benefits  to mothers who bear additional children while on welfare; and bonus payments to states that succeed in reducing their illegitimacy rates without increasing the number of abortions.
<p>
<b>14. X Out Title X.</b> Title X of the Public Health Service Act -- a program which funds family planning projects throughout the country -- has been a dismal failure, especially among teenagers.  Since it began in 1970, out-of-wedlock births, pregnancies, and abortions among teenagers have all risen sharply.  Sexually transmitted diseases have multiplied in variety and are on the rebound as well.  Last year, Title X received $194 million in your tax money.  This summer, FRC will work to change that figure to zero.  Planned Parenthood will be poorer, but adolescent well-being should flourish.
<p>
<b>15. Cures, Not Activism.</b> Federal taxpayers spend billions on AIDS through the Ryan White Care Act. Unfortunately, much money now goes to groups promoting homosexuality to school-children through "AIDS education." The Act is the single largest source of funds for homosexual activism. A Washington, D.C., recipient, the Whitman-Walker Clinic, endorses "safe" bathhouse sex (with condoms) and holds gay political seminars. Basic reform is needed.
<p>
<a name="ideas"><center><h3>Other Family-Friendly Ideas</h3></center>
<p>
<b>16. Women at Arms.</b> The Clinton administration has conducted an aggressive campaign to thrust women into military combat.  Women can now be assigned to more than 80 percent of all military positions -- many combat-related.  Meanwhile, Congress has failed to host hearings to examine the recommendations of the 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces, which opposed many of the recent changes.  The administration, with Congressional neglect, has advanced a feminist agenda without regard for readiness.  Congress should convene hearings and prepare legislation that puts readiness first.  If they don't, someday soon your daughter could be drafted.
<p>
<b>17. Off the Dole.</b> The Integrity in Government Act (H.R. 1130), sponsored by Rep. Bob Dornan (R-Cal.), would limit federally funded persons or organizations, such as contractors and advocacy groups, from lobbying Congress for more funding.  It would also prohibit lobbyists from receiving federal funds.  The legislation would not apply to recipients of entitlements and would not restrict the ability of individual citizens to communicate with their elected representatives.
<p>
<b>18. Revitalize Drug Abuse Prevention.</b> Drug abuse among teenagers has increased significantly in recent years.  This change is attributable to a resurgence of pro-drug sentiment in popular culture, less-than-effective prevention programs, and President Clinton's silence on the issue.  The administration's drug strategy focuses on "harm reduction" -- treatment for chronic drug users and less enforcement.  Meanwhile, Congress is considering cuts in drug prevention programs.  Any long-term solution requires parental involvement, community programs, and strong national leadership.  New legislation is needed to address this plague. 
<p>
<b>19. Liberate the Arts.</b> The House passed a budget resolution (H. Con. Res. 67) on May 18, providing no funds for the National Endowment for the Arts or the National Endowment for the Humanities.  The resolution also ends funding for public television after three years.  A separate bill (H.R. 1557), passed by a House committee on May 10, would phase out the endowments by 1999.  Meanwhile, several senators have introduced S. 856, a bill that would keep the NEA alive.  FRC and other pro-family forces favor total defunding.  Artists need their freedom -- and so do taxpayers.
<p>
<b>20. Restore Religious Rights.</b> Rep. Ernest Istook (R-Okla.) is heading a congressional coalition in drafting an amendment to the U.S. Constitution which would restore to individuals and groups the right to speak and express their religious beliefs.  The language of the amendment is not yet final, but it is expected to include provisions preventing the government from prohibiting prayer or other forms of religious expression wherever non-religious expression is permitted.  The amendment is also likely to ban discrimination against or denying benefits to groups on account of their religious identity or ideas.  No more second-class status for this First Amendment freedom.
<p>
<b>21. Restore Parental Rights.</b> Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) and Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) are working on legislation to prohibit the government from interfering with the right of parents to direct the upbringing and education of their children.  Such a law would, for instance, support parents who want to opt their children out of offensive sex education programs.  State constitutional amendments to protect parental rights have also been introduced in over half of the states.  Public policy cannot put families first if it does not empower parents.
<p>
<b>22. Defund Anti-Family Legal Activism.</b> Pro-family groups are calling for defunding of the Legal Services Corporation.  The $415 million per year program purports to provide legal services to the poor but often engages in politically motivated legal assaults on the family.  Since 1974, taxpayers have given LSC $5 billion, some of it used for things like obtaining cable TV for prisoners, fighting welfare reform, seeking public abortion funding, and forcing states to fund sex-change operations.

<a name="meaning"><center><h3>The Meaning of Family</h3></center>
<p>
On the grounds of the U.S. Capitol there is a small cluster of crab apple trees, one of the most moving monuments in all of Washington.  The cluster was planted on June 12, 1952 in memory of the Sullivan brothers, five sons of Iowa who died in 1942 during an attack upon the <i>U.S.S. Juneau</i> in the Solomon Islands.
<p>
After this devastating tragedy, the U.S. Navy changed its policy allowing service by family members on the same vessel.  Never again would a single American family lay, simultaneously, so "costly a sacrifice on the altar of freedom." (A. Lincoln)
<p>
In 1942 the contributions of American families -- the meaning of <i>family</i> -- to our nation's well-being and survival were never in question.  Today, as the accompanying <i>Blueprint</i> shows, our nation is at grave risk of forgetting all that the courage and faithfulness of families have given this land.
<p>
As Americans commemorate the family during this month of June -- from  
celebrations honoring the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, to Father's Day -- Congress could give the nation no greater gift than to make pro-family legislation a priority.
<p>
FRC's writers and analysts are working overtime to bring the best family policy analysis to print.  Our recently expanded Government Relations staff is responding to an over-rising tide of requests for information.  Your partnership with us in this effort is essential.  FRC deeply appreciates your prayers and financial support.  If you can remember FRC with an additional gift this month, thank you.  Please use the enclosed reply card.

<TITLE>NEW RESEARCH SHOWS ADOPTED CHILDREN FARE BETTER THAN
CHILDREN IN SINGLE PARENT HOUSEHOLDS</TITLE>

<P>
<H2>NEW RESEARCH SHOWS
<BR>ADOPTED CHILDREN FARE
<BR>BETTER THAN CHILDREN IN
<BR>SINGLE PARENT HOUSEHOLDS</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<CENTER><I>by</I>
<P>
<I>Gracie S. Hsu</I></CENTER>
<P>
New research data released by the National Center for Health Statistics
shows that adopted children fare better than children in single
parent households on a number of practical health indicators.
 The study, &quot;Health of Our Nation's Children,&quot; is based
on the 1988 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS).
<P>
Specifically, the study found that adopted children are far more
likely than fatherless children in single parent households to:
<UL>
<LI><B>Wear seatbelts</B> -- While 20.6 percent of adopted children
rarely or never wear seatbelts, nearly 40 percent of children
in single-mother homes do not wear seatbelts.  This disparity
is especially marked when the children are under the age of 12.
 Among fatherless children, 30.1 percent of 3- to 4-year-olds
and 44.6 percent of 5- to 11-year-olds rarely or never wear seatbelts;
only 12.3 percent of adopted children in either age range do not
wear seatbelts.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>See a dentist</B> -- Only 10.3 percent of  adopted children
aged 3-17 have not seen a dentist in the past 2 years, compared
with 19.7 percent of children living in single-mother homes.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Live in a smoke-free home</B> -- Less than 32 percent of
adopted children currently live or have lived during the past
year in a household with a smoker, but the percentage increases
to nearly 50 percent for children in single-mother households.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Have a regular bedtime</B> -- While 8.3 percent of adopted
children have a late or irregular bedtime, fully 22 percent of
their fatherless counterparts have a late or irregular bedtime.
</UL>


<P>
These data show that children from adoptive two-parent homes are
at significantly lower health risk than children in fatherless
homes.  Such practical measurements add a unique contribution
to the overwhelming empirical evidence which demonstrates that
children living with two continuously married parents, whether
biological or adoptive, are healthier than children in single-parent
or stepparent households.  In light of the current national debates
over welfare reform and the adoption tax credit, the NHIS findings
take on even more significance.

<P>
<CENTER><H3>WELFARE REFORM AND ILLEGITIMACY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
At a time when some are attempting to shift the emphasis of welfare
reform away from discouraging illegitimacy these new data show
just cause to squarely focus attention on combating illegitimacy.

<P>
The evidence regarding illegitimacy is clear:  there is nothing
&quot;healthy&quot; about the decay of families.  Children of
never-married mothers are at elevated risk in the long term: 
they are more likely to use drugs, to be promiscuous, and to engage
in violent crime, among other high-risk activities.  But even
in the immediate, concrete terms of everyday life, measured by
seatbelt use or living in a smoke-free home, illegitimacy places
children at increased risk.  These findings are reason enough
for the welfare system to halt the subsidizing of illegitimacy
by increasing benefits to mothers who bear additional illegitimate
children while on welfare.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>THE ADOPTION TAX CREDIT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
As an alternative to illegitimacy, adoption ranks as one of the
best options.  In fact, when presented with four options as the
best means to resolve out-of-wedlock pregnancies among teenagers,
Americans ranked adoption as the best alternative (33 percent),
followed by keeping the child and marrying the child's father
(25 percent), keeping the child and raising it by herself (13
percent), and having an abortion (10 percent), according to a
recent Family Research Council poll.
<P>
Adoption is indeed a good option, and the aforementioned NHIS
data only adds more weight to the large and growing body of evidence
which shows that <B>adoption benefits children</B>.  Adopted children
are not only very often the recipients of a loving, two-parent
home, but they also exhibit high levels of self-esteem and self-identity,
as a recent Search Institute study shows.
<P>
Thus, it is encouraging that the U.S. House of Representatives
recently passed a proposal to make adoption a more affordable
choice for prospective adoptive parents by allowing a tax credit
of up to $5,000 for qualified adoption expenses.  These expenses
could include adoption fees, court costs, attorney fees, and other
expenses which are directly related to the legal adoption of the
child.

<title>SURVEY LINKS ILLEGAL DRUG USE TO POPULAR CULTURE</title>

<h2>SURVEY LINKS ILLEGAL DRUG<br>
USE TO POPULAR CULTURE</h2>

<p>
Adults and adolescents see popular culture as a major factor in
the recent increase of drug abuse, according to Columbia University
researchers.
<P>
The Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) at Columbia
released a national survey on June 29, 1995 showing that 76 percent
of adolescents and 67 percent of adults blame popular culture
-- television, movies, magazines, and popular music -- for encouraging
illegal drug use.[1]
<P>
&quot;What's at stake here is America's children,&quot; says CASA
President and former HEW Secretary Joseph A. Califano, Jr.  &quot;We
know that individuals who make it from age 10 to age 20 without
using illegal drugs, without abusing alcohol, without smoking,
are virtually certain never to do so.&quot;
<P>
The Luntz Research Company, which surveyed 2,400 adults and adolescents
between May 18 and June 8, 1995, asked, &quot;What is the most
important problem facing kids today?&quot;  One-third of the adolescents
answered &quot;drugs.&quot;  A distant second with 13 percent
was &quot;crime and violence in school,&quot; which often also
involves drugs.
<P>
The poll also included the question, &quot;When do kids start
using drugs?&quot;  Nine out of ten people who use drugs begin
by age 17.  A surprising one-third begin by age 13.

<title>ADOLESCENT MARIJUANA ABUSE GOES HIGHER</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<p>
<h2>ADOLESCENT MARIJUANA<br>
ABUSE GOES HIGHER</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
According to the 1994 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse
(NHSDA),  marijuana use among 12-17 year olds nearly doubled from
1992 to 1994.  The number of teenagers who believe they risk harm
by using marijuana has decreased.[1]
<p>
Four-fifths (10 million) of current illicit drug users use marijuana
and the highest rate of drug use is now among persons 16 to 21
years old.  They tend to be unemployed and lack a high school
diploma. 
<p>
Since the 1970's, the NHSDA has been the primary source of statistical
information on the use of illegal drugs in the United States.
 It is based on a nationally representative sample of the civilian
noninstitutionalized population age 12 and older. 
<p>
Similar results were found in a 1994 survey by the National Institute
on Drug Abuse (NIDA).  It found that marijuana use among 8th graders
rose from 6.2 percent in 1991 to 13 percent in 1994.  A similar
trend was evident among 10th and 12th graders.[2]
<p>
Both 1994 surveys found declines in the proportion of adolescents
who believe they risk harm by using marijuana occasionally has
decreased.  But White House Drug Policy Director Lee P. Brown
said, marijuana is &quot;a very dangerous drug that can cause
you to fight for your health and your life.&quot;[3]
<p>
Although some young people don't even consider marijuana a &quot;drug,&quot;
Dr. Carlton Turner, former NIDA director and head of the Marijuana
Research Project at the University of Mississippi, warns, &quot;There
is no other drug used or abused by man that has the staying power
and broad cellular actions on the body that cannabis [marijuana]
does.&quot;[4]
<p>
The short-term effects of marijuana include impairment in learning
and memory, perception, judgment and complex motor skills.  The
drug can cause difficulty in speaking, listening effectively,
thinking, retaining knowledge, problem-solving and forming concepts.
<p>
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala states, &quot;Young
people must understand that there is clear scientific evidence
that marijuana is a dangerous drug that can have acute and hazardous
effects.&quot;[5] More than 10,500 published scientific papers show
that marijuana damages brain cells, the lungs, may adversely affect
reproduction in women and fertility in men, endangers the unborn
baby and newborns of pot-smoking women, and could damage the heart.

<h2>WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING<br>
ABOUT ADOPTION</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;I hope that we will reach out across the country
and create an environment in which every couple who wants to have
a child -- or several children -- and is capable emotionally and
financially to adopt, has the opportunity to adopt.  And I hope
every child who finds himself in a situation without a permanent
relationship with adults who care will have an opportunity for
a permanent legal family; and that we will work together to make
adoption as easy as possible, as practical as possible, and as
supported as possible.&quot;  -- Speaker of the House of Representatives
Newt Gingrich at the National Council for Adoption's Adoption
Hall of Fame Banquet, 1995.
<p>
<li>&quot;Even if pro-choice and pro-life advocates can never agree 
philosophically on the question of abortion, we can agree on adoption. 
I have long been a proponent of adoption and will continue to support 
it. Both pro-choice and pro-life advocates can and should come together 
to promote adoption. Too many children desperately need families and 
homes.&quot; -- Syndicated columnist Cal Thomas, 1995.
<p>
<li>&quot;I'm particularly pleased that this house will serve
as a place from which children will be adopted under the responsibility
of Catholic Charities, and I would personally plead that everyone
who knows of this house, everyone who knows of other places like
it, will do all that can be done to promote adoption of the children
here in our own country.  We have more than 400,000 children languishing
in foster care in America.&quot; -- First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton at Mother Teresa's Home for Infant Children in Washington,
D.C., 1995.
<p>
<li>&quot;The fact is that with adoption comes joy and challenges
and, always, blessings.  If you're thinking of starting a family,
or adding another member to your present family, please consider
adopting a child who has been waiting -- sometimes a long time
-- for someone to love them and provide a happy home.  You'll
be giving a precious gift -- the special love of a family -- to
a child who desperately needs it.&quot;  -- Dave Thomas, founder
of Wendy's Old Fashioned Hamburgers restaurants in a publication
entitled &quot;Adoption Works...For Everyone:  A Beginner's Guide
To Adoption.&quot;

Dear Cleta:
<p>
I live in Glenside, PA, but my family pays more taxes to the city of 
Philadelphia than we do to our home township and county combined.  
Now Mayor Rendell has come out to my town and said we aren't paying 
enough!  We moved out of Philadelphia because we couldn't afford private 
school for our kids at the same time we were supporting patronage and 
perks for Rendell's friends.  How can I help him get it?  
<p>
--Robbed by the City of Brother Love
</pre>
<p>
Dear Robbed:
<p>
I presume you are talking about the income tax paid by people who work in Philadelphia but who live outside of the city.  Is that what you're talking about?  If not, write back and clarify.  If it is, you are taxed without representation.  You pay taxes on income to a jurisdiction in which you have no voting representation.  I'm wondering if the constitutionality of such a system has ever been tested in the courts.  Maybe you should contact one of the public interest legal foundations and discuss filing a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of such a system.

Dear Cleta:
<p>
Here is a possible idea for a "10" Veep nominee.  How about former 
governor Casey of Penn.? Yes, he is a Democrat but that makes the 
choice more provacative and interesting.  He comes from an area that 
is key to winning the election.  If he can pass any health concerns, 
he would be a great choice.
<p>
What do you think?
<p>
--Frank 
<p>
</pre>
Dear Frank:  
<p>
I think the Republican convention would go nuts if Bob Dole nominates a Democrat for Vice President.  Did you hear the furor when Dole floated Sam Nunn's name a few months ago?  I admire Bob Casey and his courage, but his health isn't great -- and with Bob Dole's age it makes the Vice Presidential candidate's health a key issue for the fall.  Nice try -- but it's probably a non-starter.

Dear Cleta:
<p>
I have long opposed the minimum wage as an infrngement into American 
private business by a fat over-regulating government.  I resent Uncle 
telling me how much I must pay someone to perform a given task.  How 
can we stop this and other unwarranted entanglement by government in 
private citizens' interests?
<p>
--Doc
</pre><p>
Dear Doc:  
<p>
The way you stop the federal government is by electing members of Congress who are willing to say "no" to their own constituents -- and get the government out of our hair.  That means you should make yourself known to candidates and incumbents and don't vote for anyone who is for higher taxes, more spending and bigger government.  That means you should vote for people who are for LIMITED government, which means term limits, balanced budget amendment, lower taxes.  If we are to create an environment where every person can realize the American Dream, we're going to have to organize the people who think like we do -- and fight back against the powerful interests who want a government that grows and grows.  If you want to help with that effort, write back and add your name to our list of the "Dream Team":  people who will work for real politcal change in America. We'll tell you how.

<a name="family"><center><h1>Family Hopes</h1></center>
<p>
<font size=+3>C</font>ontrary to the impression left by the recent O.J. Simpson 
trial, a large majority of black Americans support get-tough efforts to combat 
crime.
<p>
According to FRC's newly released Family Issues Survey, 82 percent
of blacks favor &quot;requiring convicted criminals to work while serving their 
sentence.&quot; Seventy-seven percent favor &quot;requiring convicted criminals 
to pay their victims and their victims' families financial compensation for the
pain, suffering, and economic hardship they caused.&quot;  Moreover,
85 percent of blacks favor &quot;requiring criminals to undergo drug tests to show 
that they are drug-free before completing their sentence.&quot;
<p>
<center><h3>Choose Life</h3></center>
<p>
The FRC poll, conducted by the Voter/Consumer Research Firm, also
found that:
<p>
<li><b>Adoption is considered the best response -- and abortion the
worst response -- to an unwed pregnancy.</b>
<p>
When asked what is the best response to an unmarried pregnancy,
29 percent choose adoption, 24 percent say marrying the child's father, 11 
percent choose single motherhood, eight percent opt for abortion, and the 
rest either volunteer that &quot;it depends&quot; or say they &quot;don't 
know.&quot; Conversely, when asked which of these options would be worst, 55 
percent say abortion, 13 percent say single motherhood, 12 percent say marrying 
the child's father, and six percent choose adoption.
<p>
<li><b>Most Americans -- including rank-and-file pro-lifers -- strongly
oppose subsidizing illegitimate births.</b>
<p>
Opposition runs strong and deep to &quot;increasing a welfare
mother's monthly welfare check if she has another child out of wedlock.&quot; 
Two-thirds (66 percent) say they &quot;strongly&quot; oppose such
increases.  Another 18 percent &quot;somewhat&quot; oppose welfare
benefit increases for illegitimacy. 
<p>
Only 13 percent say these increases are justified. Among those
who &quot;strongly&quot; favor laws against abortion, 70 percent 
&quot;strongly&quot; support the family cap, and another 16 percent 
&quot;somewhat&quot; support this measure.
<p>
<li><b>The religiously devout are more apt to give and volunteer --
and say they would do more if government welfare programs were dramatically 
cut or abolished.</b>
<p>
People who attend worship services at least once a week report
higher levels of giving (97 percent) and volunteering (79 percent) than any 
other demographic group. Frequent churchgoers are also more likely to say they 
would give and volunteer more if &quot;government welfare programs
were cut back dramatically, or abolished.&quot;
<p>
<li><b>Even young people think today's popular culture encourages
teen sex, violence and drug use.</b>
<p>
When asked to assess the degree to which today's movies, television,
and music lyrics encourage teenage sex, 63 percent of young Americans say 
&quot;a great deal&quot; or &quot;quite a lot.&quot;  Fifty-six percent
offer identical responses to a question about the entertainment
industry's role in encouraging violent crime, and 47 percent say the same 
about pop culture's contribution to alcohol and drug abuse. Moreover, 75 percent 
of Americans aged 18 to 30 either &quot;strongly&quot; or &quot;somewhat&quot; 
agree with the statement, &quot;The values promoted in today's movies,
on TV, and in music lyrics do not represent my own views.&quot;
<p>
<li><b>Single parents say families need help shielding kids from harmful
cultural influences.</b>
<P>
Only 36 percent of all single parents -- and 33 percent of divorcees
-- say parents can adequately shield children from violent or sexually-explicit 
material by themselves.  Better than 60 percent of single parents agree 
with the statement, &quot;These days, it is too difficult for parents to deal 
with this alone.&quot;  Moreover, 92 percent of all those surveyed say they
do not believe public libraries should make <i>Playboy</i> magazine available 
to children without parental permission.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>FOUR FIFTHS OF AMERICANS<br>
FAVOR FAMILY TAX RELIEF.</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<li><b>Most Americans strongly support permanent tax relief for families
raising children.</b>
<p>
Roughly four out of five Americans (79 percent) favor tax relief
for families raising children. Sixty-one percent say they would rather have 
&quot;a permanent tax cut beginning next year&quot; than &quot;a
temporary tax cut beginning this year.&quot;  Only 26 percent
say they would prefer temporary relief immediately.

<p>
<h3>On the Hill</h3>
<p>
<b>Partial Victory.</b> Accommodating the request of a majority of senators,
a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing was held on the Partial-Birth Abortion 
Ban Act (H.R. 1833) on Nov. 17. The bill passed the House by vote of 288-139 
on Nov. 1, drawing the votes of such infrequent supporters of abortion limits 
as Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) and freshman Rep.
Patrick Kennedy (D-R.I.).  Nurse Brenda Shafer told the Senate
committee that she assisted an Ohio abortionist with several partial-birth 
abortions, but was repulsed and then quit.  Senate floor action is likely 
before Dec. 7.  The Clinton White House continues to signal a veto.
<p><a name="gambling">
<b>Gambling Scourge.</b> Rep. Frank Wolf's bill (H.R. 497) to create
The National Gambling Impact and Policy Commission is gaining momentum. The 
bill, which has broad bipartisan support, does not outlaw, tax, or regulate 
gambling, but recognizes its growing influence. In 1993, Americans
made more trips to casinos than they did to major league ballparks.
 Today, casinos operate in 23 states, and 37 states have lotteries.  Studies 
show that gambling increases public corruption and other criminal activities. 
It cannibalizes legitimate businesses, and government's gambling-related
costs for regulation, lost productivity and family disintegration
outstrip the economic gain.
<p>
<b>Budget Break?</b> The battle between Congress and the White House
moved to the next stage Nov. 19 with an agreement to enact a balanced budget 
within seven years, using Congressional Budget Office (CBO) economic estimates. 
President Clinton reversed course and agreed to negotiate legislation by Jan. 
1 to achieve the zero deficit goal. Republican concessions on
spending control are likely.   FRC will work hard to keep the
$500-per-child tax credit in the GOP bill, as well as real spending limits 
to avoid leaving our children a legacy of debt.
<p>
<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>
<p>
<b>Playing the Odds.</b> Gambling industry political action committees
(PAC) are influencing legislation such as proposals to tax gambling revenues 
and regulate the American Indian gaming boom.  Gambling is projected to grow 
to an $80-billion-per-year industry this decade. According to the Federal 
Election Commission, PACs gave $321,942 to the major political parties in 
1993-94, and four non-PAC industry gifts totaling $690,000 went to the 
Republican National Committee in 1994. Columnist William Safire warns 
that state-sponsored gambling is a &quot;cancer ravaging society, corrupting 
public officials and becoming the fastest-growing teenage addiction.&quot;
<p>
<b>Murphy Brown Sweeps.</b> According to a new Census Bureau report,
America is experiencing a rise in the number of Murphy Brown-style moms. 
The study, released in early November, shows that the proportion of 
college-educated, never-married women who have given birth has more
than doubled in the past 10 years, while the proportion of young,
single, black women giving birth has dropped. The report also says that 
the illegitimacy rate among all never-married white women rose from 6.7 
percent to 12.9 percent.  The greatest rise in this group was, indeed, among 
women who are managers and professionals.
<p><a name="divorce">
<b>Divorce, American Style.</b> The U.S. divorce rate dropped slightly
in 1994, but <i>The Economist</i> magazine reports that divorce is still more 
common in America than anywhere else in the world. To combat this problem, 
a growing number of pro-family state leaders are working to reform
divorce laws to protect individuals who want to save their marriages
rather than promote the interests of individuals initiating divorce proceedings. 
By a margin of 55 percent to 31 percent, Americans support such reforms, 
according to FRC's newly-released Family Issues Survey.
<p>
<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>
<p>
<b>FRC Intervenes.</b> In a highly unusual move, the Fourth U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals granted a motion Nov. 20 that will permit FRC to present 
oral arguments in a key case involving homosexuals in the military. The 
case <i>Thomasson v. Perry</i> is likely to reach the Supreme Court next 
year. FRC sought to intervene in the appeals court to argue that the
Clinton administration regulations at issue do not faithfully reflect 
Congressional intent and will result in allowing declared homosexuals 
to serve.  Melissa Wells-Petry, a former Army litigator, will represent 
FRC at the Dec. 5 hearing.
<p>
<b>Young Guns.</b> A quarter of those arrested on weapons charges are
juveniles, and such offenses are the fastest growing crime among adolescents. 
Juvenile weapons cases have grown 86 percent since 1985 to more than 61,000 
arrests last year, and teen gun violence has risen steadily even
though the number of teens has declined.  Weapons offenses include
illegal use, possession, importing or exporting of guns, ammunition and the 
like.  Attorney General Janet Reno warns, &quot;If the last decade's trends 
continue unchecked, juvenile arrests for violent crime will double by the
year 2010.&quot;
<p>
<b>Money Talks.</b> A record turnout of Maine voters narrowly rejected
a proposal on November's ballot to deny special rights to homosexuals.  Four 
hundred thousand voters took part in the 53 to 47 percent outcome.  
Pro-homosexual rights forces spent an unprecedented $1.2 million, 10 times 
more than those who oppose special rights.  Despite the close vote, 
homosexual activists are pushing ahead with their plans to introduce gay rights 
bills into the Maine legislature for the 10th time.  None has passed to date.

<h3>The Bare Non-Necessities</h3>
<p>
Did local schools notice the difference when 89 percent of the
U.S. Education Department's 5,500 employees were sent home as 
&quot;non-essential&quot; federal workers during the recent budget show-down? 
Equally unnoticeable is any improvement resulting from Washington D.C.'s 
recurrent attempts at top-down education reform:  National Education Goals,
the Goals Panel, Goals 2000, the National Standards for U.S. History.  With all 
the rhetoric and frenzy over initiatives with such visionary titles, you'd 
expect to see some results as 1995 draws to a close.
<p>
But when the National Education Goals Panel met in November to provide a 
halftime report on progress toward the eight National Education Goals, set in 
1990 for the year 2000, they could point to no significant improvement. 
&quot;Progress is spotty at best,&quot; said Albert Shanker, President of 
the American Federation of Teachers union.  The panelists urged patience; 
Americans put up $3 million this year to hear the Goals Panel stall for time.
<p>
Americans are growing increasingly impatient with dismal academic
test scores year after year. Recently released results from the 1994 
National Assessment of Educational Progress remain poor: less than a 
third of the students tested were proficient readers; 57 percent of high 
school seniors scored &quot;below basic&quot; in their knowledge of U.S.
history.  Writers of the National Standards for U.S. History released last 
year thought they could improve performance by imposing an official body 
of knowledge.  However, if the 30,000 copies already distributed make their 
way into classrooms, students will continue to know more about Madonna,
whom the standards mention, than they do about Robert E. Lee, whom the standards 
ignore.
<p>
Regrettably, our millions earmarked for education reform over
the past five years have been ill-spent on bureaucracy and systems management. 
Bill Bennett, former Secretary of Education, suggested in 1989, &quot;I'd 
give the education reform movement another five years.  If we're not able
to get our schools back to where they were in 1963, after spending
40 percent more, then maybe we should just declare bankruptcy, give the people 
back their money, and let them start their own schools.&quot;  Time's up. We 
want our money back.

<h3>We the Parents</h3>
<p>
FRC has taken its battle for parental rights to the Supreme
Court.  FRC joined forces with the Of the People Foundation and asked the 
high court to hear the case of Massachusetts students and parents who oppose 
a school district's program of condom distribution to junior high and high
school students.  A &quot;friend of the court&quot; petition was
filed on Nov. 15.
<p>
In early 1992 the Falmouth School District adopted a policy
whereby school nurses were instructed to distribute free condoms to students 
as young as 11 years old -- even over their parents' objections.  Condom 
machines were also installed in high school student restrooms. FRC's brief 
argues that the program violates the parents' right to direct the upbringing 
of their children as well as the right to free exercise of religion.
<p>
In 1993, New York's highest court ruled that an identical public school 
condom distribution program violated the right of parents to rear their children 
as they see fit.
<p>
This dispute highlights the need for legislation to acknowledge
and solidify parents' fundamental rights.  To accomplish this, Sen. Charles 
Grassley (R-Iowa) and Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) have introduced the 
Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act of 1995 (H.R. 1946).  The
act establishes the fundamental right of parents to direct and
provide for the education and religious teaching of their children, and also 
addresses health care decisions and reasonable corporal discipline. Importantly, 
the act allows the government to intervene when it has a compelling interest 
to do so, and has specific allowances for cases of child abuse and neglect.
<p>
Support this much-needed legislation by calling or writing
your representatives today.

Without Welfare&quot; from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Willard Hotel in 
Washington, D.C.  The symposium is part of a larger FRC initiative to
cultivate the growth of charitable alternatives to the welfare
state.  To help political officials summon the courage to scale back the 
role of government in American life, the conference will also highlight the 
federal contribution to cultural decay.  For more information, please contact
Deanna Carlson at 202-393-2100.
<p></ul>
<li><b>Help Needed</b>

<center><font size=+2><b><i>Looking for Lincoln</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer</center>
<p>
<font size=+3>G</font>en. Colin L. Powell has declined to run for President in 
1996. He has also said that he will not accept the Vice Presidency, though 
time may change this decision. Finally, he is joining the Republican party. 
These are crucial decisions.
<p>
As everyone knows by now, Powell had described himself as 
&quot;pro-choice&quot; on abortion during an interview with ABC's 
Barbara Walters on the eve of his national book tour.  That position, 
combined with the warm reaction to his candidacy among some conservative
leaders in Washington, raised the real possibility that, for the first time 
in two decades, the Republican platform next year would reflect a 
&quot;pro-choice&quot; position on abortion.
<p>
The media response to this prospect, as well as to Powell, was
wild excitement.  From a strict news sense, it's not hard to understand why. 
A Powell candidacy presented historic opportunities: the nomination and 
possible election of the first black American President. Second, a GOP 
abandonment of its pro-life plank would have caused an earthquake
on the American political landscape.  Earthquakes are hard news.
<p>
The Republican Platform calls for a constitutional amendment to provide legal 
protection for the unborn.  It also calls for the appointment of judges who 
respect traditional values and the sanctity of innocent human life.  Has it 
made much difference?  One conservative leader has said that a pro-choice 
president like Powell &quot;could do more to lower the number of abortions 
than a presidential candidate who claims to be pro-life, who supports a 
constitutional amendment to ban abortions, but who does nothing more than pay 
lip-service to the pro-life constituency.&quot;
<p>
Of course, pro-life Americans want no part of this leader's dilemma.
 They prefer a third way: someone, Republican or Democratic, who not only claims 
to be, but is, pro-life, who supports full legal protection for the unborn, 
and who will pay service to that goal in both speech and action.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>PERSISTENCE ISN'T<br>
ALWAYS APPRECIATED.</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
So why are pro-life Americans so often made to feel like skunks at the wedding 
party?  Partly, I'm sure, it's because nothing is more alien to the modern 
American mind than a moral absolute, even when that absolute is the 
overwhelming duty to refrain from taking innocent human life.  Second,
there is the matter of persistence.  It isn't always appreciated.
<p>
In his <i>Lincoln: The War Years</i>, Carl Sandburg retells the story
of a White House reception after Lincoln's Second Inaugural. Frederick 
Douglass, the black anti-slavery leader, tried to enter the White House 
to greet the President.  Guards barred his way.  Douglass eluded them 
and rushed through the door.  He was seized and escorted to a plank that
led outside through a window. Once again on the street, he asked a 
passerby entering the White House to tell Lincoln that &quot;Frederick 
Douglass is detained by officers at the door.&quot;
<p>
Hearing the news, Lincoln invited Douglass into the East Room, and the 
journalist finally greeted the reelected president.  Lincoln told Douglass 
that he had seen him in the crowd listening to his address. &quot;There 
is no man's opinion that I value more than yours,&quot; Lincoln told him, 
&quot;what do you think of it?&quot;  Douglass replied, &quot;Mr. Lincoln, 
it was a sacred effort.&quot;
<p>
In this world of slippery slope relativism, where rights to do
wrong are enshrined among our political commandments, the pro-life cause 
is often treated like an unwelcome guest.  As 1996 approaches, some of 
the political &quot;palace guards&quot; are already trying to show us to the 
window again.  As they do so, we could use a little of the spirit of
Frederick Douglass.  After all, this cause is a sacred effort, too.

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=5>Taxing Self-Defense</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>

<hr>
<P>
 Even though you pay considerable taxes for police protection,
too often that protection fails, particularly in some areas of
the country that are overwhelmed by crime.  Consequently, many
citizens may feel the need to purchase a gun to protect themselves
and their families from the threat of crime.  What they probably
don't realize is how much they are <a href="/atr/tax-presentation/gunoped.html">paying in taxes again</a> when
they purchase the gun, merely for the privilege of defending themselves.
<P>
 All gun sales are subject to a 10% Federal excise tax paid directly
by the consumer.  The purchaser must also pay state and local
sales tax, averaging about 6%.  So right off the top, 15% of what
the buyer pays for a legal gun goes to the government in taxes.
<P>
 But that is just the beginning.  Out of the amount the consumer
pays for the gun, the manufacturer must pay Federal income taxes,
state income taxes, state and local property taxes, federal payroll
taxes, capital gains taxes, unemployment compensation taxes, workmen's
compensation taxes, business license taxes and fees, and utility
taxes.  For any delivery trucks, the manufacturer must pay gas
taxes, tire excise trucks, truck highway use taxes, and heavy
truck excise taxes.  On the phones in the factory, the producer
must pay telephone excise taxes.
<P>
 Altogether, these taxes consume about 30% of what the manufacturer
receives for the sale of a gun.  Counting the excise and sales
taxes paid by the consumer, about 46% of what the purchaser pays
for a legal gun to protect himself and his family ends up going
to the government in taxes rather than for the gun.  So if a good
self-defense weapon costs $200 in total, about $92 of that really
goes for taxes rather than for the gun.  All of the costs of manufacturing,
delivering and selling the gun are paid out of the remaining $108.
<P>
 These taxes are unfair to workers.  In a democracy, taxes should
not be hidden in the prices of products people buy.  They should
be explicit and clear, so that voters can determine whether they
think those taxes are worth what they are getting from their government.
<P>
 Thomas Jefferson wrote, &quot;Government should not take out
of the mouth of labor the bread that it has earned.&quot;  But
that is exactly what our greedy and overreaching government does
today.  It taxes you on your income when you earn it, and taxes
it again when you spend it, and taxes you over and over again
along the way.  As a result, the average family today actually
pays more in taxes than on food, clothing, and shelter combined.
<P>
 Tax relief for working people is long overdue.  Such tax reduction
would give workers more control over their own incomes and economic
future.  A major tax reduction would also greatly stimulate the
economy, leading to more jobs, higher wages, and expanded economic
opportunity and prosperity.

<center><h1>THE LEAST OF THESE</h1></center>

<p>

<font size=+3>D</font>oes increased social spending equate with better 
childhoods? For lack of a better answer, both Republicans and Democrats 
have been inclined to say &quot;yes.&quot;  Social spending by the
federal government for children and families has increased dramatically
since 1960, far exceeding the rate of inflation.  Yet, almost
all indicators suggest that child well-being today lags behind
what it was three decades ago.

<p>

Social spending advocates expect government to substitute
for mothers and fathers.  But noted child psychologist Urie Bronfenbrenner
has written that what a child needs more than government programs
is the &quot;irrational emotional attachment&quot; of fiercely
loving parents.

<p>

It's time to acknowledge that government can't buy love for
children any more than money can buy happiness for adults.  What
children really need are a mom and a dad.

<p>

<center><h3>Parents, Not Programs</h3></center>

<p>

Rather than winking at government's encroachment on families,
Congress should move quickly to pass pending parental rights legislation
(S. 984; H.R. 1946).  The legislation would neither create new
rights for parents nor repeal child abuse laws that protect children.
The new law would simply protect parents' rights to decide what
is best for their children without excessive interference from
Washington.

<p>

Having affirmed the central importance of parents, government
does sometimes have a role to play in helping parents.  One good
example is &quot;Megan's Law,&quot; which Congress has just passed
and the President has signed.  The new law requires states to
notify local law officials when convicted sex offenders are released
from prison and requires the police to notify the public when
a dangerous sex offender moves into the neighborhood.

<p>

<center><h3>Yes to Adoption</h3></center>

<p>

The community, of course, must step in to provide for children
who have no parents of their own.  But the importance of parents
remains the same -- or is even greater -- for children who are
alone.  The best government can do is to speed these children
into loving homes where loving parents are waiting.

<p>

&quot;The Adoption Promotion and Stability Act of 1996&quot;
(H.R. 3286), passed by the House but not yet by the Senate, offers
hope for vulnerable children currently free to be adopted.  In
the United States alone, there are over 50,000 foster children
awaiting adoption.  Over 20,000 children have been waiting for
a family for years.  The new legislation includes a $5,000 
non-refundable tax credit for qualified adoption expenses (for both 
domestic and international adoptions).  In order to eliminate unnecessary 
waiting periods for minority children in foster care, the legislation
also prohibits the use of racial considerations if they cause
a delay or denial of an adoption placement.

<p>

New adoption incentives will help some children; but Conna
Craig, President of the Institute for Children, argues that only
an overhaul of the foster care system will save children like
John.  A skinny kid who loves baseball, John has been waiting
for a home for nearly all of his 10 years.  Legally free to be
adopted since he was three, John's childhood is fast slipping
away.  He needs policymakers to understand that every child needs
a mom and a dad.

<p>

<center><h3>It Takes a Pro-Family Village</h3></center>

<p>

Even strong two-parent families require strong communities
to help pattern for children right habits of the heart.  When
so many children are languishing without families of their own,
community becomes all the more important.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

<center><i><font size=+2>
STAND FOR CHILDREN?<br>
STAND FOR FAMILIES.
</font></i></center>

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

&quot;The American Community Renewal Act of 1996,&quot; spearheaded
by Republican Congressmen James Talent (Mo.) and J. C. Watts (Okla.),
will strengthen communities more than any government handout
ever could by offering tax incentives for charitable giving, public
housing reform, and an end to government regulations that stifle
economic development in depressed neighborhoods.  By rebuilding
communities, we will strengthen the hands of parents -- and restore
some of childhood's lost innocence.

<p>

It's fair to admit that it takes a village.  Just as long
as we really mean a local &quot;village&quot; that preserves parent
autonomy, instead of a federal fiefdom that chains both children
and families to an all-powerful state.  Standing for children means
standing for families first.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>

<p>

<b>Senate Shake-Up.</b> Robert Dole leaves the Senate on June
11, freeing him of the need to navigate the Senate's procedural
obstacles.  Dole's departure has also set off a chain reaction
of races for top leadership posts in the Senate.  Majority Whip
Trent Lott and Republican Conference Chairman Thad Cochran are
vying to succeed Dole, with most insiders predicting a Lott victory.
GOP Policy Committee Chairman Don Nickles is running unopposed
to succeed Lott in the number two position of Whip.  Both have
advocated limited government, traditional family values, and the
sanctity of life.

<p>

<b>Suicide with Dignity?</b> The House Judiciary Subcommittee
on the Constitution recently held a hearing on assisted suicide.
The hearing followed two new federal circuit court decisions
legalizing &quot;physician-assisted suicide.&quot;  Witnesses
discussed the legal and moral ramifications of the rulings.  The
Ninth Circuit based many of its arguments on the <I>Roe</I> (1973
abortion decision) interpretation of &quot;privacy,&quot; overturning
a law approved by Washington State voters to ban assisted suicide.
The Second Circuit overturned a similar New York law. Several
members of Congress are writing legislation to reverse or restrict
these flawed decisions.

<p>

<b>Aiding Babies.</b> Congress has passed a measure under the
Ryan White Care Act to reduce the transmission of AIDS from pregnant
women to their babies.  The provision promotes voluntary counseling,
testing and treatment for pregnant women and the testing of newborns
for HIV.  Testing of newborns for HIV will be required if states
have not reduced the number of infected infants by 2000.  This
issue had been in deadlock for months because of opposition by
certain homosexual and feminist groups.  They argued that it could
lead to expanded mandatory AIDS testing and infringe on a woman's
&quot;right to privacy.&quot;

<p>

<b>PX Porn.</b> The House of Representatives' 1997 Defense Authorization
Act bans future military sales of pornography.  Last year the
Pentagon sold 12.6 million copies of 219 different pornographic
magazines, earning $4.3 million.  Military customers pay less
than the market price and pay no tax.  Government vending of pornography
sends the message that profiting from material that demeans women
is okay.  But common sense and science show that readily available
porn encourages, rather than discourages, episodes like Tailhook.
Senate action is next.

<p>

<b>Gambling Loses.</b> Pro-family forces, overcoming a well-financed
gambling industry campaign, secured Senate committee passage
of legislation to create a Gambling Impact and Policy Commission
(S. 704) on May 14.  The House passed similar legislation (H.R.
497) on March 5.  The unanimous Senate vote eases the way for
final congressional approval.  The Gambling Commission, which
has been granted subpoena power, will evaluate the industry's
impact on families, businesses and society.  The Commission will
submit recommendations for Congress and the states and will provide
insight into the consequences of legalized gambling.

<p>

<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>

<p>

<b>Bioethical Lapse.</b> President Clinton will soon appoint
15 members to his National Bioethics Advisory Commission.  The
commission's role is to &quot;identify broad principles to govern
the ethical conduct of research.&quot;  A White House office released
a revealing list of potential nominees.  Among the extreme views:
a Harvard Medical School professor who advocates legal changes
in the definition of death so that organs can be harvested for
transplantation before brain death occurs, and a Yale lawyer who
argues that parents who withhold birth control from their adolescent
children commit child neglect.

<p>

<b>Racial Reconciliation.</b> Family Research Council recently
hosted a meeting of African-American leaders in Washington, D.C.,
to discuss projects for racial reconciliation.  Among the goals
of the meeting was to reaffirm FRC's desire to address the specific
needs and concerns of all families, regardless of race or culture.
Participants explored how FRC and other family organizations
can more effectively fulfill the pro-family mission and help to
heal ethnic divisions in modern America.

<p>

<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>

<p>

<b>Sleet, Snow, and Frosty U.S. Attorneys.</b> On May 9, the
U.S. Postal Inspection Service successfully busted a nationwide
child pornography ring, despite the refusal by U.S. Attorney Janet
Napolitano and others to cooperate.  Napolitano, a Clinton appointee,
reportedly refused to authorize a search warrant for the operation
because she felt it improperly targeted homosexual men.  However,
inspectors were able to obtain the search warrant from local authorities.
Senators Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) have asked
Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate Napolitano to determine
whether she wrongly impeded the sting.

<p>

<b>Pro-life Planks.</b> Twelve Catholic and Protestant pro-life
leaders (including Gary Bauer) have signed a public pledge supporting
the current Republican platform language on legal protection for
unborn children.  While most media stories have focused on 
&quot;inside-the-beltway&quot; Republican skirmishes over this language, 
many pro-life Democrats are disturbed about their party's entrenched position 
favoring abortion on demand. Some 40 pro-life House Democrats are urging
party leaders to rewrite the 1996 platform to support at least
some protection of prenatal life.

<h3>FRC: Friend of the Family</h3>

<p>

The battle for pro-family policy is increasingly being fought,
not only in the halls of Congress, but in the courts.  In many
cases, groups opposing pro-family policies take advantage of liberal
courts, avoiding public and congressional debate of controversial
issues.  FRC has filed amicus curiae (&quot;friend of the court&quot;)
briefs in many cases, several of which are highlighted and described
below.

<p>

FRC has been active in defending anti-pornography laws in
cases like <I>ACLU v. Reno</I>.  In this case, FRC acted
as co-counsel defending the Communications Decency Act.  Our brief
defends the constitutionality of the Act, which is designed to
prohibit the knowing distribution of pornography to children.
No matter the outcome, all parties anticipate that the case will
ultimately go to the Supreme Court.

<p>

FRC has also been vocal in pro-life cases around the country.
Most recently, FRC filed an amicus brief in <I>Shenck v. Pro-Choice
Network</I>, a case to be heard in the Supreme Court in October
debating the constitutionality of court-ordered, 15-foot &quot;floating
bubble zones&quot; around patients entering and exiting abortion
clinics.  These &quot;zones&quot; are specifically intended to
prevent peaceful demonstrators from talking to anyone going in
or out of an abortion clinic.

<p>

In <I>United States of America v. Commonwealth of Virginia</I>,
FRC has co-sponsored a brief defending the right of the Virginia
Military Institute to admit males only and to continue receiving
government funds.  This case holds implications for all publicly
supported single-sex schools, whether military or not, across
the country.

<p>

<I>Romer v. Evans</I> (the &quot;Amendment 2&quot; case)
was decided on May 20.  FRC filed an amicus curiae brief asserting
that the Supreme Court of Colorado wrongly negated the people's
right to pass laws that deny special rights to homosexuals.  The
6-3 Supreme Court decision means that pro-family voters are effectively
precluded from winning on this issue at the state level, at least
insofar as a measure binds lower political jurisdictions.

<p>

Melinda Paras, spokeswoman for the National Gay and Lesbian
Task Force, commented that the decision drives a &quot;stake through
the heart&quot; of ballot measures sponsored by pro-family groups.
FRC is examining options for a legislative response to <I>Romer,</I>
and the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution has
promised to hold hearings.

<h3>Free Needles for Junkies?</h3>

<p>

A major media push is under way, using government reports,
to prove that giving clean needles to drug addicts slows the 
spread of the AIDS virus without encouraging illegal drug use. 
But the evidence is inconclusive and should not be used to 
start dangerous needle give-away programs.

<p>

Two of the three medical doctors on the leading and much-cited
government needle study say that needle exchange programs (NEPs)
&quot;are not the panacea their supporters hope for.&quot; They
favor more drug treatment rather than exchanges.

<p>

A 1993 law permits the government to use federal funds to
support exchanges if they can be scientifically shown to slow
the AIDS virus without increasing drug abuse.  So far, however,
needle studies are problem-plagued.  They rely on self-reporting
by addicts, downplay sexual transmission of the AIDS virus, generally
ignore the impact on communities near exchange sites, trivialize
the drug problem and never measure HIV seroconversion rates, the
only true indication of effectiveness.

<p>

Philip Lee, assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services
and a former needle researcher, has expressed concern that NEPs
&quot;may send a mixed message about drug use.&quot;  There are
75 NEPs now operating in 55 U.S. cities without federal funds.
These programs provide free drug-injecting supplies, condoms,
advice on shooting drugs properly, warnings about bad heroin,
and counseling that sometimes leads to treatment.

<p>

Lee Brown, President Clinton's first drug czar, said he &quot;can
find no compelling reason&quot; to fund NEPs.  Barry McCaffrey,
the nation's new czar, has said, &quot;The problem is not dirty
needles; the problem is heroin addiction.&quot;

<p>

&quot;Our goal should be to eliminate drug abuse,&quot; says
Rep. Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.), &quot;not to find a cleaner, safer
way to do it.&quot;  Dr. James Curtis, director of the Department
of Psychiatry, Harlem Hospital Center, says exchanges are &quot;poor
medicine&quot; and &quot;promote a breakdown in law and order.&quot;

<p>

Although the science is inconclusive, expect AIDS activists
and pro-drug legalization forces to pressure the federal government
to approve funds for NEPs.

<font size=+2><b><i>Renewing Our Vows</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer
</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>I</font>n announcing his support for the just-introduced 
federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana had
this to say:

<p>

&quot;The definition of marriage is not created by politicians
and judges, and it cannot be changed by them.  It is rooted in
our history, our laws, our deepest  moral and religious convictions,
and our nature as human beings.  It is the union of one man and
one woman.  This fact can be respected or it can be resented.
But it can't be altered.&quot;

<p>

If someone had told me five years ago that we would find
ourselves in 1996 defending marriage as the union of one man and
one woman, I would have asked him if he wanted me to take him
to my leader -- jokingly, of course.

<p>

Yet this idea of opening marriage to homosexual couples,
which seems more suited to another planet, is stalking the land.
Prompted by an impending court decision in Hawaii, legislators
in more than 30 states are rushing to protect their marriage statutes.
As of this writing, 11 states had enacted marriage protection
laws. 

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

<center><i><font size=+2>
ELEVEN STATES HAVE ACTED TO<br>
PROTECT MARRIAGE.
</font></i></center>

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

At the federal level, the Defense of Marriage Act was introduced
in the House on May 7 by Reps. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) and Bob
Barr (R-Ga.) and in the Senate on May 8 by Don Nickles (R-Okla.).
It is being endorsed by a slowly growing list of Congressional
sponsors, but many more are needed -- and swiftly, as the Supreme
Court decision in <I>Romer v. Evans</I> illustrates (<I>See</I> 
&quot;Courtwatch,&quot; page 3).

<p>

This is the most important pro-family legislation in many
years.  If marriage falls, it will begin a domino effect that
will totally redefine families within the law and culture.  For
starters, children will be taught in school that homosexuality
is the moral equivalent of marital love, businesses will be forced
to subsidize homosexual relationships, and churches that uphold
biblical morality will find themselves outside the civil law.

<p>

On Mother's Day, I debated Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) on
<I>This Week With David Brinkley.</I>  I reminded Mr. Frank that
it was fitting that we were discussing this on Mother's Day, since
our celebration of motherhood is one of the most powerful expressions
of just why the idea of homosexual &quot;marriage&quot; is so
dopey.  But it is more than dopey; it is dangerous.

<p>

If unelected judges in Hawaii are able to impose their will
on the rest of the nation through the Constitution's Full Faith
and Credit Clause (which compels the states to recognize each
other's licenses and records), then what's safe?  If two men can
marry, why can't three men?  Or two men and a woman?  Or a man
and a boy?

<p>

During our debate, Frank made the usual unfounded charge
that his opponents are motivated by &quot;hatred&quot; and 
&quot;prejudice.&quot; He repeated what has become homosexual activists' 
key argument against DOMA:  it is unnecessary.  Homosexual 
&quot;marriage&quot; is still illegal all over the U.S.  In other words, 
Barney Frank and friends want us to wait for a judicial defeat before we 
take the field in defense of marriage.  I'm sorry, but that's not good
enough. Marriage is the God-given foundation of society, and if
we let it be ruined, our children will rightly hold us responsible.

<p>

During the Battle of Britain, when things looked darkest,
Winston Churchill told the English people to &quot;never give
up.  Never, never, never, never give up.&quot;  Well, friends,
not only won't we give up defending marriage, we cannot give up.
I urge you to call or write your senators and congressman now
and press them to sponsor DOMA. Next Mother's Day, I don't
want to be debating a triumphant Barney Frank and his newly married
&quot;spouse.&quot;

<p><hr width=50%><p>

On May 19, the Family Research Council placed a full-page ad in 
<i>The Washington Post</i> with the tag line, "Let's Save Marriage, 
Before the Whole Cake Crumbles." The ad summarized the arguments for 
preserving the institution of marriage as a legally binding 
relationship between one man and one woman. <b>For a copy of the ad, 
or information about placing it in a local publication, call us at

<p><hr size=5 noshade><p>
<a name="un"><h2><i>UN:  Bound for Beijing</i></h2></center>
<p>
<font size=+3>F</font>rom Sept. 4-15, 1995, the United Nations (UN) will hold
its Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China.  The United
States will be sending a delegation to the conference -- despite
the objections of pro-familiy advocates.  First Lady Hillary Clinton
was originally slated to attend, but at latest word will not,
due to China's imprisonment of American human rights activist
Harry Wu.
<p>
<center><h3>Bracketing the Family</h3></center>
<p>
This conference purports to advance women's rights.  However,
many pro-family groups, including FRC, oppose the Beijing conference
agenda for the very reason that it denigrates women and families,
reflecting a radical feminist agenda.  For, not only is the conference
being hosted by a country with a long track record of abusing
women (e.g., female infanticide, coercive abortion policies),
but the platform document:
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>"<font size=+3>M</font>OTHER" IS BRACKETED<br>
FOR REPLACEMENT.</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<b>Denigrates motherhood and traditional family life.</b> For example,
the word &quot;mother&quot; has been bracketed throughout the
entire platform so that it might be changed to the term &quot;caretaker.&quot;
 Similarly, the word &quot;family&quot; has been bracketed for
change to &quot;household.&quot;  Bracketed sections indicate
that delegates could not agree in advance on the text.  These
sections are to be debated in Beijing.  In addition, the word
&quot;family&quot; almost always appears in a negative context,
i.e., in relation to domestic violence or female oppression.
<p>
<b>Devalues the husband-wife relationship to a mere power play.</b>
  Consider paragraph 198 of the platform:  &quot;Inequality in
the public arena can often start within the family when power
relations between men and women are unbalanced with discriminatory
attitudes and practices within the family.  The unequal division
of labour and responsibilities within households based on unequal
power relations also limits women's potential...&quot;  Thus,
rather than acknowledging marriage as a cooperative partnership,
the platform pits one mate against the other.  Notably, the words
&quot;wife&quot; and &quot;husband&quot; are never used.
<p>
<b>Leaves the term &quot;gender&quot; open for interpretation.</b>
 &quot;Gender&quot; appears more than 200 times in the platform
document.  But when asked to define the term, the UN rejected
the suggestion that there are two genders: &quot;male&quot; and
&quot;female.&quot;  The UN also rejected the definition of &quot;gender&quot;
as &quot;the socially-constructed roles which society assigns
to men and women.&quot;  In feminist literature, this definition
means that gender is subject to change and there exists a spectrum
of genders, perhaps even five (e.g., male heterosexual, female
heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, and transsexual).  Instead,
the UN decided that &quot;gender&quot; was to be understood &quot;in
its commonly accepted meaning.&quot;  The definition battle will
be a major focus in Beijing.
<p>
<b>Undermines parental authority in reproductive health decisions.</b>
 The platform repeatedly states that governments should &quot;emphasize
the role and responsibility of adolescents in sexual and reproductive
behavior through the provision of appropriate services and counseling[.]&quot;
 While occasionally mentioning the legal responsibility of parents
for their children, the platform refuses to recognize parental
authority regarding their children's reproductive health.
<p>
<b>Promotes abortion and contraception as reproductive &quot;rights.&quot;</b>
  In the tradition of previous UN conferences in Cairo and Copenhagen,
the Beijing platform urges governments to &quot;take action to
ensure that women's sexual and reproductive rights are fully recognized
and respected&quot; (paragraph 232).  In fact, the platform elevates
reproductive &quot;rights&quot; above all other rights, stating
that &quot;the ability of women to control their own fertility
forms an important basis for their enjoyment of other rights&quot;
(paragraph 98).

<center><h3>What You Can Do</h3></center>
<p>
Contact your representative and senators, either in Washington
or at their in-state office.  Tell them to speak out against the
Beijing conference, publicizing its violations of women's fundamental
dignity.

<h3>On The Hill</h3>
<p><a name="issues">
<b>The House Holds.</b> Before adjourning for its August vacation, the
House of Representatives passed two amendments to curb U.S. promotion
of abortion overseas.  Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) led the fight
to prevent U.S. funding of groups that seek to overturn the anti-abortion
laws of sovereign nations.  The Smith amendments would also deny
U.S. aid to the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) if it continues to
participate in China's coercive population control program.  Sen.
Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) intends to offer the same amendment to S.
908, the State Department authorization bill.
<p>
<b>Pro-Family Sendoff.</b> U.S. delegates to the Beijing Women's Conference
received pro-family instructions from the Senate on August 1.
 Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex.) offered an amendment which
called on the U.S. delegation to promote a representative perspective
on the value of motherhood and the traditional family.  The amendment
also urged the delegates to define &quot;gender&quot; classically,
as in &quot;male and female, the two sexes of the human being.&quot;
 Pro-family delegates and observers participating in pre-conference
negotiations at the UN headquarters in New York were energized
by passage of the resolution.
<p>
<b>Pop Aid Bust.</b> The foreign aid bill passed by the House in July
will make it more difficult for the Clinton Administration to
carry out its population control agenda.  The &quot;development
assistance&quot; account, which has traditionally provided hundreds
of millions of dollars each year for international population
projects, was substantially reduced and a separate account was
dedicated to child survival and disease prevention efforts.  Pro-family
forces will now try to persuade the Senate to go along with the
reduced anti-population money.

<center><h3>The United Nations at Half-Century: A Primer</h3></center>
<p>
<font size=+2>T</font>he messages of congratulation poured in from all over the
world.   President Truman thanked Almighty God for bringing the
world community so far in its search for peace.  South African
Prime Minister Jan Christian Smuts called its Charter &quot;not
a perfect document, by any means . . . But at least it is a good,
practical, workmanlike plan for peace.&quot;  As he presided over
the final vote to create the United Nations, taken on June 25,
1945, Britain's Lord Halifax expressed the hope that the delegates
had taken part &quot;in one of the great moments of history.&quot;
<p>
To carry out its charter, the United Nations has, over time,
created an alphabet soup of commissions and agencies.  Some of
these entities have social and economic missions; others have
military missions.  Recently, peacekeeping activities by UN agencies
in such trouble spots as Somalia (UNISOM), Haiti (UNMIH) and the
former Yugoslavia (UNPROFOR) have raised serious questions about
the world body's effectiveness and its proper role.  
<p>
The UN has grown with the decolonization of major European
powers and the breakup of the Soviet empire. The major bodies
of the UN have different functions. The UN's annual budget is
$4 billion. The U.S. contribution, according to our Mission to
the UN, is between $1 billion and $1.5 billion.  UN documents
are printed  in the five official languages: English, French,
Spanish, Chinese and Russian.   Unless otherwise indicated, the
UN body described below is headquartered in New York.
<p>
<b>The General Assembly.</b>  The largest UN body, the General Assembly
is comprised of 185 member states.  Each member has one vote in
the General Assembly.  The General Assembly has authorized many
of the key UN agencies which have a direct impact on families.
 These include the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD),
the UN Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA), the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF), and the UN Development Fund for Women
(UNIFEM).
<p>
<b>The Secretariat.</b> This body is headed by the Secretary-General,
who reports to the General Assembly.  He supervises executive
functions of the UN.  The Secretary-General has traditionally
been selected from the ranks of the &quot;non-aligned&quot; nations.
 Boutros Boutros-Ghali (Egypt) currently serves in the post.
<p>
<b>The Security Council.</b>  The Security Council consists of 15
members.  Five of these -- Russia, China, the U.S., Britain and
France -- have veto powers over council actions.  The Council
is charged with responding to threats to peace.
<p>
<b>The Economic and Social Council.</b>  The 54 members of this
body are elected to terms by the General Assembly.  It is responsible
for UN efforts in the economic and social areas.  It includes
many specialized agencies.  Among them are the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO, Rome), the World Health Organization (WHO,
Geneva), the International Labor Organization (ILO, Geneva), the
very influential International Monetary Fund (IMF, Washington),
the newly created World Trade Organization (WTO), and the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO,
Paris). 
<p>
<b>The International Court of Justice (World Court, The Hague,
Netherlands).</b> The 15 judges are elected to nine-year terms by
the General Assembly and the Security Council.  Questions are
decided by majority vote.  All members of the UN are members of
the World Court, as are non-members Switzerland, San Marino and
Liechtenstein.

<p><a name="convention">
<font size=+3><i>The</i></font> United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child
(UNCRC) was approved by the UN General Assembly on Nov. 20, 1989.
 It was in force on Sept. 2, 1990 after the 20th nation ratified
it.
<p>
The United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Madeleine
Albright, signed the treaty on Feb. 16, 1995.  President Clinton
has said that the U.S. will spell out its interpretation of the
Convention with a statement of  &quot;reservations and understandings&quot;
that will go to the Senate.
<p>
A treaty becomes law in this country if the U.S. Senate ratifies
it by a two-thirds vote (67 Senators, if all are present).  This
has not yet happened and seems unlikely because Sen. Jesse Helms
(R-N.C.), a strong opponent of the Convention, is chairman of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which must review it.
<p>
In fact, on June 14, Helms introduced S. R. 133.  This resolution
expresses the sense of the Senate that &quot;the primary safeguard
for the well-being and protection of children is the family, and
that, because the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the
Child could undermine the rights of the family, the President
should not sign and transmit it to the Senate.&quot;  Twenty-three
Senators are cosponsors.
<p>
As an international treaty, the UNCRC would be co-equal with
federal statutes, and possibly the United States Constitution.
 If the United States were to ratify the treaty as it stands,
it would become not only an international obligation, but also
a domestic obligation potentially regulating the most intimate
details of American family life. 
<p>
Several articles in the Convention grant children new rights
independent of their parents and families.  In the U.S. today,
children's rights are, in effect, held in trust by their parents.
 Under the Convention, children would hold those rights themselves.
 Conceivably, taking a child to church, when he would rather not
go, could be a violation of the child's right to freedom of religion
(Article 14); telling a child to turn off the television could
violate the child's right &quot;to seek, receive, and impart information&quot;
(Article 13), and so forth. 
<p>
The Convention on the Rights of the Child is a risk America's
families do not need -- and cannot afford -- to take.
<p><hr><p>
<a name="march"><center><h3>The UN and the Family: Major Documents</h3></center>
<p>
<font size=+2>T</font>he United Nations was founded in the shadow of the Second
World War, a renewed attempt by the victorious democracies to
establish an international body to safeguard the peace and promote
human rights.  From the beginning, with the drafting of the UN
Charter and related documents such as the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights, the UN has attempted to give voice to the common
aspirations of the world's people.  Only within the past two decades
has the UN expanded its agenda in ways that pose direct threats
to the traditional family.
<p>
Here are some major landmarks in the history of UN advocacy
regarding marriage and the family:
<p>
<b>Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</b> Article 16 asserts
the right &quot;to marry and to found a family,&quot; provides
that marriage must be entered into &quot;freely&quot; by the spouses,
and defines the family &quot;as the natural and fundamental group
unit of society . . . entitled to protection by society and the
state.&quot;  The Declaration was adopted by the UN General Assembly
in 1948.
<p>
<b>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.</b>
 The Covenant, which is in treaty form, promotes special measures
to protect the family, mothers, and children.  Article 10 repeats
the definition of family in the <b>Universal Declaration</b> and calls
for &quot;the widest possible protection and assistance&quot;
to the family. Addresses such issues as family leave and child
labor.
<p>
<b>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</b> Article
23 of the Covenant uses the same definition of family as the <b>Universal
Declaration</b>, and requires nations that have ratified the Covenant
&quot;to ensure equality of rights and responsibilities of spouses
as to marriage[.]&quot;
<p>
<b>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
Against Women.</b> Article 12 introduces language requiring nations
to ensure access to health care, including family planning.  Like
the <b>Universal Declaration</b>, it speaks clearly of &quot;men&quot;
and &quot;women&quot; in these contexts.  Article 16 enumerates
eight specific rights as regards marriage, with emphasis on equality
of rights regarding children and property and the &quot;right
to decide freely and responsibly on the number and spacing of
their children[.]&quot; The United States has not ratified this
Convention.
<p>
<b>International Year of the Family (IYF).</b> First proposed in
1987, the year was actually celebrated in 1994.  In the best modern
UN mode, Secretary General Boutros-Ghali announced that &quot;[t]here
is no single definition of a family.  There is no one model.&quot;
 An IYF document, &quot;The Changing Family Structure,&quot; lumped
together everything from &quot;polygamous&quot; and &quot;community&quot;
families to &quot;biological&quot; and &quot;adoptive&quot; families.
 &quot;Same-sex&quot; families also get equal footing in the document.
<p><hr width=65%><p>
<h3><center>NGO: FRC and the UN</center></h3>
<p>
&quot;NGO&quot; is one of the most commonly heard terms in
UN-speak.  It stands for &quot;Non-Governmental Organization,&quot;
and refers to private associations specifically recognized and
consulted by the United Nations.  Examples include the International
Red Cross, Amnesty International, Greenpeace, and Planned Parenthood.
 NGOs are first mentioned in the UN Charter of 1945 as important
resources for the General Assembly and the various commissions
it creates to address specific issues.
<p>
NGOs may be international or merely national in scope.  Their
number is large (some 1,500) and growing.  The presence of UN
Headquarters in New York City has given New York-based NGOs a
considerable advantage in lobbying the UN on a daily basis.  Some
NGOs, like WEDO, led by former Congresswoman Bella Abzug and a
major participant in UN conferences on population and the environment,
are almost fully funded by foundation money.  Others are grassroots-oriented.
<p>
NGO status can be permanent or temporary, allowing a group
access to the UN generally or merely to specific conferences.
 The Family Research Council was granted NGO status for the world
population conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1994.  FRC has
also obtained NGO status for Beijing (<i>see earlier article</i>).  This status
does not allow FRC to vote on the Beijing Plan, but it <i>will</i> make
us more effective eyes and ears for the American family.

<center><b><font size=+2><i>What So Proudly We Hail?</i></font></b><br>
by Gary L. Bauer</center>
<p>
Americans have historically sacrificed for peace. We went
to war twice in this century for the peace and freedom of Europe.
 Americans fought and died defending the independence of Korea,
Vietnam, Grenada, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.  Most recently, Americans
have shouldered the burden of famine relief in strife-torn Somalia.
The American people and their government respond generously to
natural disasters. 
<p>
America has taken a leading role in supporting the United
Nations, too.  From 1945 on, the U.S. provided the greater part
of UN funding and support.  President Kennedy defended the world
organization when the Soviets tried to hamstring it with a three-man
troika in place of its single Secretary-General.  That formula
would have guaranteed paralysis -- which is what the Soviets really
wanted.
<p>
Despite this record, the UN has often been a three-ring circus
of anti-Americanism.  The U.S. has regularly been denounced as
&quot;imperialist&quot; and a &quot;war monger&quot; during what
passed for UN debates.  Efforts to empower the nations of the
&quot;South&quot; by levying confiscatory assessments on the free
industrial democracies of the &quot;North&quot; have been popular
among all too many members of the General Assembly.  Third World
delegates have cheered the so-called New World Information Order,
which is nothing more than a dignified name for press muzzling
by tinpot despots. 
<p>
Still, Americans have remained largely willing to tolerate
the UN as an important forum for international discussion.  For
the sake of peace, we have gone the extra mile.  Recent stories
about UN diplomats who have run up thousands of parking violations
in New York City and who have stiffed the Big Apple's merchants
to the tune of millions have struck nerves, however.  No warm
and fuzzy talk of &quot;cultural disparities&quot; should cover
the obvious truth:  a ripoff is a ripoff.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+3>UN E</font><font size=+2>XPANSION</font> 
 <font size=+3>T</font><font size=+2>HREATENS</font><br>
<font size=+3>U.S. S</font><font size=+2>OVEREIGNTY</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
This corruption is far less troubling than the new trend
toward building an army of &quot;blue helmets&quot; to police
the world.  UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has moved
aggressively since the collapse of the Soviet Union to assert
a new doctrine of sovereignty. <i>Sovereignty</i>. That's a key word
and concept.  Americans recognize it better by referring to our
founding document, the Declaration of Independence.  That document
set forth our right to stand &quot;among the powers of the earth&quot;
as a free and equal nation.
<p>
The Secretary General's expansive view of UN authority is
not just an opinion.  The UN fielded only two peacekeeping missions
in its first five years, but it has dispatched the blue helmet
19 times in the past four years.  Many have greater ambitions
still.  Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, a communist, is
pushing a worldwide environmental initiative which sees a major
role for the UN.  Former French President Francois Mitterand,
a socialist, advocates the creation of a &quot;UN Legion&quot;
to give military teeth to the UN's resolutions. 
<p>
Veteran liberal Ronnie Dugger would go even further.  He
writes in <i>The New York Times</i> that if the member states are unwilling
or unable to man a UN Legion, the UN should accept volunteers
from the recognized Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs).  These
private groups are playing an increasing role in UN activities.
 The <i>Rainbow Warrior</i>, the Greenpeace ship that has confronted
whalers and nuclear test personnel, might be the first of a whole
fleet under the Dugger plan.
<p>
All of these suggestions come at a time of growing UN military
focus.  The UN Department of Peacekeeping has expanded from a
staff of 23 to more than 350 today, with a modern &quot;situation
center,&quot; staffed 24 hours a day.  What are the limits to
this mushrooming role?
<p>
As we watch the UN's Beijing Conference on Women, we should
each ask ourselves:  what if an army had the power to enforce
the resolutions passed by these delegates?  Would Americans remain
free and independent? I once considered such questions idle speculation.
 Not anymore.

Dear Cleta:

     How do I get my local newspaper to print my 'letters-to-the-editor'?

     It is my humble opinion that my letters are both cogent and relevent, 
yet they are rarely printed.  They are not overly wordy nor are they blazing 
tirades, but rather are reasoned opinions on todays issues.  I usually open 
with a statement, build a reasoned argument supporting my opening statement 
and then close with a call to action.  I always include my name, address 
and phone number with the letter for verification.

     Can you offer some suggestions?  If you would like, I can send an 
example of a recent letter for your critique.

Cordially,
Robert
</pre>
<p>
Dear Robert:  
</p>
<p>      You didn't say where you're from, so I don't know if you live in a big city or a small town.  Big city papers are the worst -- they are hard to crack because people don't know one another personally.  In a smaller community, the editors tend to know the folks who write letters.  Here are some suggestions:  Call the editor who puts together the letters page (or feature) and ask for an appointment.  Go see the editor and take some of your rejects.  Ask for constructive criticism and try to find out why none of your letters have been printed.  If the editor is a decent person, he/she will try to be helpful and may give you some pointers.  What will really happen is he/she will have a face to put with your name and you'll probably get your next letter printed.  If the editor is a jerk, document the way you were mistreated and send a letter to the editor's boss, usually the managing editor, with a copy to the jerk.  You'll never get a letter printed afterwards but it's not happening now either -- so at least you may be the one who sensitizes the paper a bit for the next guy.
<p>
     The problem with most newspapers is there is little or no competition.  But if there are weekly papers or other community papers in your area, don't overlook those.  They tend to be much more receptive to letters and citizen involvement.  And if you have a local radio talk show, be sure to call and tell your story there about how the newspaper is blacking out your opinions.  One of the reasons that radio talk shows are so successful is because people who have been shut out of many newspapers finally have an outlet.
<p>
     Good luck -- and keep writing (and expressing) your opinions!
</p>

Dear Cleta:

     I live in the 20th Congressional District of Texas, "represented" by 
Henry B. Gonzalez, a fat socialist thug who beat up a constituent with whom 
he disagreed in a public restaurant in San Antonio.  The case went to court, 
where Gonzalez's wrists were slapped.  He has a Republican opponent, James 
Walker, who needs help in his campaign.  You don't have to be a rocket 
scientist to know if Gonzalez were backed with tanks and guns he'd be a 
communist.  Ideologically, he thinks just like a communist.  But, lo and 
behold, Walker IS a rocket scientist!  He's a smart guy who can use our help.  
The redrawn district has many independents and conservatives, while many of 
its yellow-dog Democrats may not vote out of disgust for Gonzalez, who was 
nowhere to be found during the fight to save Kelly AFB--in his 20th District--
from the chopping block.

Sincerely,
Marco
</pre>
<p>
Dear Marco:
</p>
<p>  See my advice in our    <a href="/abic/letters/letter-3.html.cgi">first Capital Letters column</a> regarding my representative, Connie Morella.  The same advice holds true for every incumbent.  One difference is that you have a candidate right now.  If he doesn't have a lot of money, it may take more than one race for him to win.  Remember, an entrenched incumbent may have to face a tough challenge a couple of times before it's successful.  And sometimes the mere fact that he/she is facing a tough race is enough to cause him/her to take that fat congressional pension and retire.

     In Gonzalez's case, his taxpayer supported pension is worth over $1.2 million.  Why not round up some money and run some radio ads telling people that Gonzalez voted against term limits, against the balanced budget amendment and has a big fat congressional pension that he's voted for himself?  And if it doesn't work this time, just keep working on letting people know how he votes.  It certainly doesn't represent the thinking of that district, I'm sure.  Don't let him get by with it!  Just tell on him every chance you get.

Dear Cleta:

     Very nice web page!  Listen, you think you have problems with Connie 
Morella?  My Congressman, Albert Wynn (D-MD 4) makes Rep. Morella look like 
a right wing conservative!  This district is one of those "minority" 
districts that is full of government employees, very liberal, etc.  Wynn 
takes elections with 75+% of the vote, and gets lots of AFL-CIO money.
How do we get HIM to listen to logic and reason, or, in the alternative,
displace someone like him?

Signed,
Ron

<p>
Dear Ron:
<p>
     You've just advanced a major reason why the "apartheid" districts have been held unconstitutional by the US Supreme Court.  Race cannot be used as a factor in determining the congressional district boundaries.  Unfortunately, political persuasion and incumbency can -- and that is what matters most to incumbents.
<p>
     In the meanwhile, I believe that most black voters are much more conservative than their representatives.  Think about putting together a group of thoughtful constituents in Wynn's district that is bi-racial.  Visit some black ministers and start talking with them about family values and morality issues.  Most minority voters support issues like school choice, term limits, and conservative positions on social issues. Most minority representatives in Congress vote the other way.  See if you can build some common ground with some of the minority citizens who share your views on issues -- and once you get to know one another, perhaps you can reach consensus on some issues on which Wynn votes wrong.  Your activist group might be able to persuade him to change his voting pattern - or perhaps you can begin grooming a replacement who would be more in line with your views.  Don't just assume that minority voters are in tune with their Congressional Black Caucus.  On many, many issues, that is not the case.  The problem is that members of the Black Caucus rarely have any opponents so they vote however they want to.  It is a disgraceful situation and one that is perhaps being changed by the recent Supreme Court rulings on the racial gerrymandering.
<p>
     P.S.  Thank you for the compliment about the web page!  We're glad you're enjoying it!

<p>
<font size=+3>I</font>n a sweeping victory for families, Congress recently 
passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996, including provisions protecting
children from computer pornography.  The Telecom Act extends current
child protection laws to cyberspace, using the court-approved
&quot;indecency&quot; standard to keep patently offensive material
away from minors.  The cyberporn provisions punish only knowing
violations, while preserving existing electronic mail privacy
laws.
<p>
The significance of the new law's computer porn section cannot
be overstated.  It represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity
to set ground rules for the next great communications medium.
Pornographers have been flooding this promising technology, and
the new Telecom Act comes not a moment too soon.
<p>
<center><h3>ACLU Logs In</h3></center>
<p>
The American Civil Liberties Union has filed suit to strike
down the computer pornography section as unconstitutional.  Clearly,
the ACLU is fighting a losing battle.  Time and again, the courts
have upheld the constitutionality of &quot;indecency&quot; restrictions
in other contexts, most recently regarding dial-a-porn services.
FRC will file its own brief in response to the ACLU challenge.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>ACLU FIGHTS A<br>
LOSING BATTLE</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
The battle now shifts to the Clinton administration, whose
resolve in defending the law is questionable.  Last April, President
Clinton voiced concern that children &quot;may be exposed to things
on computer, which in some ways are more powerful, more raw and
more inappropriate than those things from which we protect them
when they walk in a 7-Eleven.&quot;  Clinton declared, &quot;I
do not believe in any way, shape or form that we should be able
to do on e-mail, or through the electronic superhighway anything
beyond what we could elsewhere.  I think the First Amendment has
to be uniform in its application.&quot;
<p>
However, in recent days the Clinton administration has appeared
to retreat from this resolve.  The floundering is reminiscent
of the notorious <I>Knox</I> case, where the administration tried
to weaken the federal child pornography law it was bound to defend.
Although Congress rebuffed that attempt, fear remains that the
administration might try a similar tactic again.
<p>
Objections to the new cyberporn law have less to do with
free speech than with arrogance and greed.  The &quot;online elite&quot;
know that if this new medium is to be truly open to a diverse
community, all members of that community will deserve respect,
including children.  Even with the new law, parents must be ever
vigilant in ensuring that cyberporn remains off-limits to their
children.
<p>
<center><h3>Nixing PX Porn</h3></center>
<p>
FRC continues to fight pornography on other fronts.  Last
month at the Supreme Court, FRC filed a legal brief in <I>Alliance
for Community Media v. F.C.C.</I>, a case challenging the regulation
of pornographic programs on cable television access channels.
The challenged law would simply give private cable operators
the ability to limit indecent programs.  It would relieve operators
of the current law requiring them to show everything, no matter
how offensive. In their lawsuit, the plaintiffs charge that restoring
a cable operator's right to decide against airing indecent programs
amounts to indirect government censorship.  FRC supports the right
of private cable operators to reject &quot;nude talk shows&quot;
and &quot;amateur porn hours&quot; on access channels.  Oral argument
at the Supreme Court was set for Feb. 21.
<p>
Pornography in the military has been another flashpoint.
For years, the U.S. military has been the nation's largest porn
purveyor, stocking military exchanges with tax-free smut worth
millions of dollars.  Not surprisingly, in recent years the military
has been plagued by sexual misconduct and assault.  New Jersey
Rep. Christopher Smith is drafting a bill to prohibit the sale
of pornography at military facilities worldwide.
<p>
<center><h3>What You Can Do</h3></center>
<p>
Over the last few months, tremendous progress has occurred
in the fight against pornography, thanks largely to grassroots
support.  Your continued involvement will help keep these gains
intact.  Insist that child protection laws apply consistently
to all areas of society, including the Internet.  Urge your members
of Congress to support the pending Smith bill on military porn.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>
<p><a name="believers">
<B>Forsaken Brethren.</B>  FRC President Gary Bauer testified
on Feb. 15 before the House Subcommittee on International Operations
and Human Rights regarding anti-Christian persecution overseas.
Bauer testified that this persecution takes many forms, from
harassment of worshippers to, in Ethiopia, actual crucifixion.
Abuses seem to be especially prevalent in certain Moslem countries.
Bauer called for a more coherent response from the U.S. Government
and from U.S. religious leaders:  &quot;How much longer,&quot;
he said, &quot;can we allow persecuted Christians overseas to
call out, 'Why have you forsaken us?'&quot;
<p>
<B>CAREERS Update.</B>  The National Governors Association recently
released a statement urging final passage of the CAREERS bill
(H.R. 1617) within 30 days.  Progress in a House-Senate conference
committee to combine CAREERS with the Senate's Workforce Development
Act (S. 143) has been slow due to major differences between the
bills, which would consolidate job training programs.  The bills'
extensive Labor Market Information System and implementation of
a skill certificate system could threaten workers' economic freedom.
Governors favor consolidation, which gives them more authority
over state job training and economic development.
<p>
<B>Pro-Life Progress.</B> A short-term spending bill signed by
President Clinton on Jan. 26 included three pro-life measures.
They are:  a ban on federal funds for the experimental creation
of human embryos; a ban on federal funding of abortions for prison
inmates, except in the case of rape or life of the mother; and
a compromise restriction on international population funds.  The
compromise will bar funding until July 1 for organizations that
perform or promote abortions overseas, but allow funding thereafter
at reduced levels from 1995 spending.  Pro-life members of Congress
continue to seek permanent restrictions.
<p>
<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>
<p>
<B>Innocent as Charged.</B> After a more than year-long federal
grand jury investigation, the Clinton Justice Department has found
no evidence of a national conspiracy to attack abortion clinics.
However, Attorney General Janet Reno has vowed to continue the
probe, and Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) has called for congressional
hearings on the issue.  Meanwhile, federal and state prosecutors
have used the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) act
to charge two peaceful pro-lifers, sidewalk counselors Carmen
Vazquez and Bobby Riley, with &quot;obstructing&quot; and 
&quot;interfering&quot; with women seeking abortions.
<p>
<B>Drug Fighter.</B> President Clinton has selected a get-tough
soldier to lead our nation's battle against drugs.  During his
State of the Union address, Clinton announced his decision to
tap Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey to replace drug czar Lee Brown,
who is now teaching in Texas.  Gen. McCaffrey is an expert on
narcotics trafficking who returns to Washington from a command
in Panama, where he has overseen U.S. cooperation with Latin American
and Caribbean nations on drug intelligence and interdiction since
February 1994. Drug abuse among American youth con-tinues to
rise.
<p>
<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>
<p><a name="baer">
<B>Baer Backs &quot;Mule.&quot;</B> Federal Judge Harold Baer,
Jr. provoked a firestorm Jan. 24 when he threw out the drug trafficking
conviction of Carol Bayless.  Bayless was driving a car with 80
pounds of cocaine and heroin in the trunk. Two accomplices ran
when police observed them.  Judge Baer,  a Clinton appointee,
said: &quot;Residents in this neighborhood tend to regard police
officers as corrupt, abusive and violent.  Had the men not run
when the cops began to stare at them, it would have been unusual.&quot;
Bayless had confessed to being a regular drug courier (&quot;mule&quot;).
<p>
<B>PC &quot;Volunteers.&quot;</B>  Mandatory voluntarism takes
the spirit out of serving, argue many parents and secondary school
students.  Graduation requirements for &quot;volunteering&quot;
are prompted by Goals 2000, which encourages community service.
But what some programs call service is actually political activism.
Others exclude religious service activities.  The conflict over
mandatory service may soon reach the U.S. Supreme Court if a New
York decision upholding a service requirement is appealed.  Federal
parental rights legislation (S. 984, H.R. 1946) could provide
a remedy by defining parental authority in school matters.
<p>
<B>Army Salvation.</B> An Army wife, Tambra Hartmann, lost her
license to run a home-based day-care service on a military post
because she said grace with the children over meals and played
Christian music.  The children's parents selected the service
in part because it was faith-based.   Last November, the U.S.
Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Army overstepped
its authority and violated the families' First Amendment freedoms.
The Army has changed the regulation to permit faith elements
as long as child-care providers inform parents of that fact before
enrollment.

<h3>Wedding Bans</h3>
<p>
Acting before Hawaiian courts mandate homosexual &quot;marriage,&quot;
which may occur in July, pro-family activists nationwide are working
to protect the definition of marriage.
<p>
In California, the state assembly voted 41 to 31 on Jan.
31 to prohibit the recognition of same-sex relationships as marriage.
A tougher vote is expected in the liberal Senate.  Utah enacted
a law in 1995 that defines marriage as the union of &quot;one
man and one woman&quot; and bars recognition of same-sex nuptials.
Other states considering such measures: Alabama, Alaska, Colorado,
Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island,
South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and Washington.  In Maine,
a marriage protection bill was introduced but withdrawn after
a lesbian legislator withdrew her own homosexual rights bill.
In Nebraska, a bill legalizing same-sex marriages has been introduced.
<p>
At the national level, a federal bill is being written to
reinforce the &quot;one-man, one-woman&quot; definition in all
policies, including Social Security and the military.  The tentative
title is the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), and a sponsor was
being sought at press time.
<p>
The gravity of the situation cannot be overstated.  If homosexual
&quot;marriage&quot; becomes law in Hawaii and is imposed on all
other states through the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution,
businesses will be forced to subsidize homosexuality, schoolchildren
will be taught that homosexuality is equivalent to marital sex,
and churches will be pushed into a religious &quot;ghetto,&quot;
where pressure will mount for conformity to civil law.  Redefining
marriage would redefine the family, giving homosexuals an uncontested
&quot;right&quot; to adopt children.
<p>
Citizens can do two things to preserve marriage:  1) contact
your state legislators and urge them to support current legislation
or to introduce a bill protecting marriage; 2) ask your congressman
and U.S. Senators to cosponsor the eventual federal bill.  The
Capitol Hill switchboard number is (202) 225-3121 or (202) 224-3121.

Marriage (513) 733-8908.

<h3>Wobbling on Welfare</h3>
<p>
The promise to &quot;end welfare as we know it&quot; remains
a popular talking point, but on Jan. 9 President Clinton vetoed
the welfare bill passed by congressional Republicans.
<p>
The nation's Governors have now advanced their own welfare
reform package, and regrettably they have chosen to abandon serious
attempts to reduce illegitimacy.  The House and Senate agreed
last year to prohibit states from using federal funds to increase
welfare payments to women who bear additional children while on
welfare, but would have allowed states to opt out of the prohibition.
<p>
While erasing the focus on illegitimacy, the Governors proposed
<I>adding</I> an extra $4 billion in child care funding.  Their
recommendation would increase spending on day care 49% more than
current law, without spending a penny on abstinence programs to
help reduce out-of-wedlock births.  The emphasis on child care
is ironic, since the Governors also moved to weaken the work requirements
passed by congressional Republicans.
<p>
In a letter to House colleagues, Congressman Jim Talent (R-Mo.)
argued that the last time Congress adopted a welfare plan proposed
by the Governors, a Democrat from Arkansas rode to the White House
partly on the strength of his pledge to fix the mess.  If the
Congress listens to the Governors' advice this year, it will have
committed itself to spending over half a trillion dollars to subsidize
fatherlessness through cash benefits, day care, job training,
and other services.
<p>
A recent FRC poll shows that three out of four Americans
believe that welfare encourages illegitimacy and, by a ratio of
two to one, that reducing illegitimacy is more important than
merely encouraging single mothers to support themselves.  A hefty
84% of Americans support a family cap, and an overwhelming majority
believe that work requirements should focus last on mothers with
preschool-aged children.  Both provisions would help reduce the
Governors' incentive to capture new federal dollars for child
care -- and would allay our concerns about leaving children, yet
again, at the mercy of public institutions.

<center><font size=+2><b><i>Foster Has a Future</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer</center>
<p>
In his State of the Union Address on Jan. 23, President Clinton
made an appeal to pro-family Americans.  He talked about balancing
the budget, reforming welfare, attacking drug abuse, and reducing
the rate of teen pregnancy, among other things.  For Drug Czar,
the President made a choice American families warmly applauded,
Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey.  Now comes Clinton's Teenage Pregnancy
Czar, and the ovation is over:  Dr. Henry Foster, Planned Parenthood
advocate extraordinaire and failed nominee for Surgeon General,
is back in the saddle.
<p>
Almost a year ago, President Clinton tapped Dr. Foster to
replace Joycelyn Elders as Surgeon General, saying that he wanted
Foster's Nashville-based teen pregnancy program, &quot;I Have
A Future,&quot; replicated throughout the nation.  But part of
the reason Foster was rejected as Surgeon General was that his
program, like all contraceptive-based programs, proved a dismal
failure.  According to an evaluation by the Carnegie Corporation,
a program underwriter, participants in &quot;I Have a Future&quot;
actually had <I>higher</I> rates of sexual activity than those
outside the program.
<p>
This is not the kind of leadership that America wants or
needs to help combat teen pregnancy.  This is not the kind of
program that will help reach the President's stated goal of reducing
the teen pregnancy rate by one-third over the next 10 years. 
And this is surely not the kind of approach that will help our
children grow up to be responsible and mature adults.
<p>
The research is crystal clear.  Teenagers' best safeguard
against having or causing an out-of-wedlock pregnancy is to have
two loving parents involved in their lives.  But it's also important
to create a culture where the values that parents teach their
children are reinforced outside the home.  Several abstinence
programs have done just that, with excellent results.
<p>
For example, only 1.1 percent of participants in the Washington,
D.C.-based <I>Best Friends</I> program became pregnant, as opposed
to 25 percent of other girls in the city.  The abstinence curriculum
<I>Teen-Aid</I> helped to reduce the teen pregnancy rate in Jacksonville,
Florida, by 35 percent just three years after it was implemented.
Examples of other successful abstinence programs abound.
<p>
Tragically, the President has chosen to support ideology
over progress.  The Foster task force has been christened the
&quot;National Campaign to Reduce Teen Pregnancy.&quot;  Reducing
pregnancy among unmarried teens is a laudable goal.  But to reach
it we must have a sustained reversal of the sexual activity that
haunts the young with unprecedented rates of pregnancy, abortion,
disease and emotional heartbreak.  Unfortunately, the Foster
group has already admitted that it intends to promote contraception
rather than abstinence.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>CLINTON CHOOSES IDEOLOGY<br>
OVER PROGRESS</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
While raising children well is a tough job, it's not impossible.
In truth, the teen pregnancy rate has been declining for the
last two years because more teens are choosing abstinence despite
all of the federal projects and cultural pressures promoting the
contrary.  Statistics published by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention show that the drop in teen pregnancy rates reflects
a rising number of teens choosing to abstain from sex.
<p>
The familiar Scripture says, &quot;Train up a child in the
way he should go, and when he is old he will not turn from it.&quot;
(Proverbs 22:6).  Last June the U.S. Senate reviewed Dr. Foster's
credentials and told the President this <I>isn't</I> the way
we should go.  But the President has refused to turn from his
old friend.  So now it appears that Henry Foster has a future
in government.  It's our nation's young people for whom the future
now looks a little bleaker.

<TITLE>THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT: IT'S TIME TO FREE THE ARTS</TITLE>
<BODY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/insight/insight.gif">
<P>
<H2>THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT:<BR>
IT'S TIME TO FREE THE ARTS</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<CENTER>
<I>by</I>
<P>
<I>Robert H. Knight</I></CENTER>
<P>
After years of debate and attempted reform, it has become clear
that the National Endowment for the Arts is beyond reclamation
and should be zero-budgeted by the 104th Congress. 
<P>
Particularly with regard to the visual arts (drawing, painting
and sculpting) and &quot;performance&quot; arts (theater, film,
live acts), the NEA has been a platform for attacks on religion,
traditional art forms, traditional families and traditional values,
and a forum for the promotion of homosexuality.  In the name of
tolerance, it has shown increasing intolerance toward standards
of any kind, including ordinary standards of artistic skill. 
Its peer review process has long been a buddy system for awarding
grants to colleagues, friends and clients of panel members, who
are almost uniformly hostile to traditional culture.   
<P>
However, even if the federal agency did manage to clean up its
act, the entire idea of government sponsorship of art is a bad
one.  Whenever the government decides to subsidize one artist
and not another, the government, in effect, determines what is
art and what is not.
<P>
Unlike any other arts sponsor, the federal government has unique
authority and responsibility.  Its powers derive from its claim
to represent all Americans and its money from mandatory taxes.
 NEA grants greatly influence what is presented in museums and
theaters and what private donors feel is worthy of support.  As
former NEA Chairman John Frohnmayer noted: &quot;Our grantees
state unequivocally that fund-raising is substantially easier
because of an Endowment grant.  It is an endorsement -- a mark
of quality and achievement.&quot;[1]
<P>
And what has the NEA done with this awesome responsibility? 
<P>
Since its founding, the NEA has openly favored the avant-garde
-- defined by <I>Webster's Third New International Unabridged
Dictionary</I> as: &quot;Those who 
create, produce or apply new, original or experimental ideas,
designs, techniques...and sometimes: a group that is extremist,
bizarre, or arty and affected.&quot;[2]  Unfortunately, the NEA seems
to have taken the latter portion of the definition to heart. 
There is a place, of course, for experimental art, but it should
be funded privately, not by taxpayers whose money often is used
to disparage their most deeply held beliefs.
<P>
As a federal agency, the NEA should not be fostering a bias toward
one particular art style over another.  In fact its own grant
guidelines specifically forbid it to do so or attempt to direct
artistic content.[3]
<P>
One reason the NEA has been able to promote bad art without public
scrutiny is that the media are not telling the whole story.  TV
broadcasters and newspapers are restrained by the bounds of good
taste from reproducing the most offensive works funded by the
NEA.  A January 2, 1991 <I>Los Angeles Times </I>article about
an NEA grant to performance artist Karen Finley described her
work only as &quot;strongly feminist in tone.&quot;[4] This leaves
the impression that Finley, who calls herself the &quot;Queen
of Dung,&quot; is controversial merely for being a feminist, not
because of her vulgarities.  
<P>
Because of this kind of obfuscation, most Americans have only
an abstract concept of the works in question.  Senator Jesse Helms,
the NEA's most active critic, has offered to debate the issue
on any TV network providing he can show viewers what is being
debated.  All have refused.  And for good reason.  If NBC-TV actually
aired some NEA-funded works, it would violate Federal Communications
Commission rules against obscenity and risk losing its broadcasting
license.  One federal agency would find itself prosecuting a company
for displaying materials sponsored by another federal agency.
<P>
<H3><CENTER>THE CHAIRMAN'S VIEWS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Under the chairmanship of actress Jane Alexander, the NEA has
not curbed its hostility toward traditional values.  In fact,
Alexander told the homosexual magazine <I>The Advocate</I> that
she intended to use the NEA to &quot;introduce people gently to
gay themes all across the country. And I mean gently, because
if you start with a kind of very overt thing, people get scared....
 You gently bring in gay people and introduce them to the world
through art.&quot;[5]
<P>
When asked, &quot;What sorts of grants would you reject out of
hand,&quot; Alexander answered: &quot;It's hard to say at this
point if there is any grant that I might reject.&quot;[6]
<P>
Indeed, Alexander later defended a performance in February 1994
at the NEA-funded Walker Art Center in Minneapolis in which an
HIV-positive performer, Ron Athey, sliced into another man's back
with a knife, mopped up the blood with towels and sent them on
clotheslines over the horrified audience.  He also had two female
assistants weave acupuncture needles through his own scalp and,
in turn, pierced the women's cheeks with steel spikes.[7]
<P>
Asked by a reporter what she thought of the performance, Alexander
replied that she trusted the judgment of the Walker management,
and said, &quot;Not all art is for everybody....  Americans are
certainly not used to seeing bloodletting, except in films, and
when it happens in person, it must be surprising.&quot;  Alexander
added that she thought &quot;all appropriate precautions&quot;
regarding health had been taken, &quot;So what are we left with
that was considered controversial?  The sacrification [sic], the
ritual-like aspect?  Is it that the man is homosexual?&quot;[8]
<P>
Congress responded to Alexander's lack of action by cutting $4
million from the NEA budget.  Athey then performed his act at
another NEA-funded theater, New York's P.S. 122.  &quot;With full
knowledge of this,&quot; culture critics David Horowitz and Laurence
Jarvik note, &quot;The NEA again funded both P.S. 122 and the
Walker Art Center in the most recent grant cycle.  Plainly, the
agency is deaf to the concerns of Congress and the public.&quot;[9]
<P>
Some of the more serious problems[10] at the NEA include:
<P>
- Bias against religion; rejecting positive portrayals of religion
as violating the separation of church and state, but funding attacks
on religion as &quot;artistic expression&quot;;
<P>
- Elevation of &quot;freedom of expression&quot; and &quot;artistic
merit&quot; as the main criteria for grants, ignoring the NEA's
charter legislation of 1965, which set &quot;encouragement of
excellence&quot; as the No. 1 criterion, followed by &quot;access
to the arts for all Americans&quot;;  
<P>
- Confusion in upper management about how to comply with congressionally-mandated
standards;
<P>
- Confusion about the NEA's primary mission;
<P>
- Conflicts of interest in the grant-awarding process;
<P>
- A bureaucracy openly hostile to public scrutiny;
<P>
- Bias against traditional forms of art and traditional values
in general.
<P>
<H3><CENTER>HOSTILITY TOWARD RELIGION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The First Amendment prohibits Congress (and federal agencies authorized
by Congress) to infringe on religious liberties.  It is clearly
unconstitutional to use federal tax dollars to create and distribute
an attack on religious beliefs.  The government has no business
dictating the value of religious beliefs or prescribing changes
in them. 
<P>
Yet the taxpayer-supported NEA over the years has funded works
that degrade or mock religious belief, particularly Christianity.
<P>
- In June, 1993, the Whitney Museum of American Art, which received
$200,000 from the NEA during 1992-1993, displayed <I>Abject Art:
Repulsion and Desire in American Art</I>.  The exhibit's journal
explains the focus: &quot;Although 'abject art' is a play on 'object
art,' the term does not connote an art movement so much as it
describes a body of work which incorporates or suggests abject
materials such as dirt, hair, excrement, dead animals, menstrual
blood, and rotting food in order to confront taboo issues of gender
and sexuality....  Employing methodologies adapted from feminism,
queer theory, post-structuralism, Marxism, and psychoanalysis,
our goal is to talk dirty in the institution [of art] and degrade
its atmosphere of purity and prudery by foregrounding issues of
gender and sexuality in the art exhibited.&quot;[11]
<P>
The Whitney show included works by Joel-Peter Witkin, who received
four fellowship grants from the NEA: Fiscal year 1980, $3,000;
FY 1981 $12,500; FY 1986, $15,000; FY 1992, $20,000.[12] Witkin's
work includes &quot;Maquette for Crucifix,&quot; a naked Jesus
Christ surrounded by sado-masochistic obscene imagery, and many
grotesque portrayals of corpses and body parts.  Another Whitney
exhibit was a film by Suzie Silver titled &quot;A Spy,&quot; which
depicts Jesus Christ as a woman standing naked with breasts exposed.
 The Whitney also included &quot;Piss Christ,&quot; Andres Serrano's
photograph of a crucifix in a jar of urine, and a film by porn
star Annie Sprinkle titled &quot;The Sluts and Goddesses Video
Workshop or How to be a Sex Goddess in 101 Easy Steps.&quot;[13] Sprinkle
has performed numerous times in NEA-funded venues such as Highways
in Los Angeles and The Kitchen Theater in New York, where she
has had audience members come on stage to examine her exposed
genitals.
<P>
- Diamanda Galas, who was The Kitchen Theater's first artist-in-residence,
performed &quot;Plague Mass&quot; at the Cathedral of St. John
the Divine in Manhattan in 1990, during which she appeared topless
and covered with blood.[14] A member of ACT-UP, the AIDS activist
group, she was arrested during a demonstration at St. Patrick's
Cathedral in New York in 1989.[15] On July 8, 1993, she opened the
Serious Fun Festival at Lincoln Center, which was supported by
a $14,700 dance grant from the NEA.[16] As the New York Times explains,
&quot;Conceptually, her work is close to that of the late David
Wojnarowicz, the visual artist-writer who died of AIDS in 1992.&quot;
 In 1990, the NEA gave a $15,000 grant to Wojnarowicz, who specialized
in photographs of men performing oral sex, anal sex, anal-oral
sex and masturbation.  An essay in one of his exhibits described
New York's John Cardinal O'Connor as &quot;a fat cannibal from
that house of walking swastikas up on fifth avenue,&quot; and
a &quot;creep in black skirts.&quot;[17]
<P>
- Anti-Christian material is distributed through the NEA-supported
Video Data Bank at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.[18]
The following are a couple of the offerings, with descriptions
cited from &quot;Gay and Lesbian Tapes Distributed by the Video
Data Bank&quot;:
<P>
<I>Popular Thought</I>.  This video equates the &quot;moral majority&quot;
with totalitarianism.  &quot;UThe message reverberates with the
interweaving of archival footage of Nazi Youth, book burnings
and modern day Ohio Youth for Jesus creating an audiovisual fabric
of hatredU -- Carole Ann Klonarides.&quot;
<P>
<I>Peccatum Mutum (The Silent Sin)</I>.  &quot;...explores relationships
among cloistered nuns....  Utilizing gothic expressionistic sets,
humor, serious kissing, and melodrama, this work expresses the
contradictions and ironic similarities between physical desire
and spiritual fervor.  A rare glimpse at the other side of Catholic
guilt.&quot;
<P>
<H3><CENTER>TARGETING THE FAMILY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Promotion of &quot;alternative lifestyles&quot; has long been
a staple of NEA grants.  A case in point is, again, NEA support
of the Video Data Bank, which offers these films and accompanying
synopses:[19]
<P>
- <I>Swamp</I>.  &quot;This subversive soap opera targets the
family, psychotherapy and property as the villains.&quot;
<P>
- <I>A Coalminer's Granddaughter</I>.  &quot;This hysterically
funny epic about a brutally realistic American family does for
lesbians what John Waters did for Baltimore....  Under the thumb
of her sleazy, evil father (brilliantly portrayed by novelist
Kevin Killian) Jane is not the hero of her own life....  <I>Coal
Miner's Granddaughter</I> opens up into the impressionistic world
of her sexuality...highly charged sexuality [that makes] staples
of lesbian erotica seem tepid and silly.&quot;
<P>
- <I>Talk to Me Like the Rain</I>.  &quot;...two brothers whose
incestuous behavior feeds a disillusionment in the trust and faith
with one another [sic].&quot;
<P>
- <I>Stephen</I>.  &quot;This production focuses on the story
of siblings and, in this case, twins locked in a complex, emotional
and sexual relationship....  In the end, the expectations of both
religion and a modern world are abandoned....&quot;
<P>
- <I>The A Ha! Experience</I>.  &quot;...explores the erotic elements
of mother-infant intimacy that are repeated in the oedipal devaluation
of the mother, the object of desire for the daughter.&quot;
<P>
<H3><CENTER>PROMOTING HOMOSEXUALITY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
By validating the pro-homosexual viewpoint through taxpayer-supported
government grants, the NEA has helped legitimize pro-homosexual
theater in general.  <I>New York Newsday</I> arts critic Linda
Winer notes that: &quot;The fact is, much of the theater these
days is gay....  Indeed, much of it has been for a very long time....
 This season there have been so many gay projects that I've been
searching for an alternative to the term 'straight play' when
describing a nonmusical.&quot;[20]
<P>
NEA-funded venues such as The Woolly Mammoth Theatre in Washington,
D.C., The Franklin Furnace and The Kitchen in New York, Highways
in Los Angeles, and countless other NEA-funded theater groups
around the country present works promoting homosexuality and blasting
traditional morality.  The NEA also supports pro-homosexual projects
shown on the Public Broadcasting System.  Some recent examples
of pro-homosexual, NEA-supported works:
<P>
- In April, 1994, Woolly Mammoth staged NEA grant recipient Tim
Miller's one-man performance, &quot;My Queer Body,&quot; in which
he, among other things, describes what it's like to have sex with
another man, climbs naked into the lap of a spectator, and finally
arouses himself sexually in full view of the audience.[21]
<P>
- In January, 1994, the Public Broadcasting Service showed <I>Tales
of the City</I>, a three-part miniseries celebrating homosexual
life in San Francisco in the 1970s.  The series was full of gratuitous
nudity, crudity, lewdness and dozens of instances of foul language.
 Families are lampooned and homosexuality is portrayed as superior.
 The series was co-produced by American Playhouse, which received
$750,000 in NEA funds in 1993.  NEA received an on-screen credit
as a supporter of the film. 
<P>
- In August 1994, the Public Broadcasting Service aired <I>One
Nation Under God</I>, a misleading, one-sided documentary by two
homosexual activists that attempts to discredit ex-gay therapy
and counseling.[22] The NEA is credited as a main sponsor for the
film, which links Christian ministries to Nazi techniques such
as shock/aversion therapy, a practice which has long been denounced
by the ex-gay movement.  The film misportrays several homosexual
activists, misrepresents Evelyn Hooker's psychological studies
of homosexual men in the 1950's, and uses Biblical references
out of context.  The film also takes quotes from several therapists
and former homosexuals out of context.  In one clip, a former
homosexual explains that he used to think that &quot;God hates
homosexuals,&quot; but that he now knows that God loves them.
 The filmmakers include only the fragment, &quot;God hates homosexuals,&quot;
reversing the man's intended meaning.  Dr. Elizabeth Moberly,
author of <I>Psychogenesis</I> and founder of a Pennsylvania-based,
ex-gay ministry, says the filmmakers misrepresented themselves,
took her out of context in her taped interview and distorted severely
what she and other therapists had said.[23] The film was shown at
several gay and lesbian film festivals during the summer of 1994
and at the 1995 Gay Games and Cultural Festival in New York City.
 Over the years, the NEA has supported several gay and lesbian
film festivals, which have presented hard-core pornography and
anti-religious themes.[24]
<P>
- The NEA-supported Video Data Bank at the School of the Art Institute
of Chicago offers numerous homosexual films.  <I>Danny</I>, a
20-minute documentary, includes footage touting &quot; Uthe raw
sensuality of cruising and anonymous encountersU -- Robert Rosenberg,
Global Village.&quot;  <I>Jollies</I> is an 11-minute film by
Sadie Benning, who &quot;recounts her earliest sexual encounters.&quot;
 Another Benning work, <I>Me and Rubyfruit</I>, &quot;chronicles
the enchantment of teenage lesbian love.&quot;  Other titles in

<P>
<H3><CENTER>TALKING POINTS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B>Curbing the NEA would amount to censorship, and that's against
the First Amendment, isn't it?</B>
<P>
The First Amendment to the Constitution states that &quot;Congress
shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom
of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peacefully
to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.&quot;
<P>
The Constitution limits the federal government and, by extension
of the 14th Amendment, the states, from censoring protected speech,
as defined over the years by Supreme Court cases.  It does not
limit individual citizens nor private groups, which have freedom
to maintain their own standards of decency and their own viewpoints.
 The issue is one of sponsorship, not censorship.  There is no
constitutional &quot;right&quot; of an artist to a subsidy from
his fellow taxpayers.  
<P>
<B>But won't the arts collapse without federal aid?</B>
<P>
More than $9 billion in private giving sustains arts in communities
all over America.[25} The NEA's $175 million is important more for
its symbolism than for the actual dollars involved.   An NEA grant
validates an artist, and the government should not be in the business
of determining what is art.  That process smacks of &quot;official&quot;
art, such as is imposed on the artistic communities in totalitarian
societies.
<P>
<B>Can the NEA be reformed?</B>
<P>
No, it can't.  Congress has tried several times to rein in the
rogue agency, including appointing an independent commission to
study the NEA in 1990.  With some fanfare, the NEA adopted a few
reforms, but continued to fund the worst excesses in the art world.
 Even after Congress slightly cut the NEA's budget in 1994 as
a message of discontent, it continued to shovel money to artists
whose primary purpose is to insult the majority of taxpayers.
 Also, NEA officials consistently have displayed an arrogant disregard
for the taxpayers.  Even a pro-reform arts critic, the late Samuel
Lipman, who had been a member of the National Council on the Arts
during the 1980s, finally came to the conclusion in the 1990s
that the agency was irreparable and should be abolished.
<P>
<B>Besides ending subsidies for bad art, are there any other reasons
to defund NEA?</B>
<P>
Yes.  The federal deficit is out of control, so Congress must
find ways to cut back without endangering infrastructure.  Before
1965, the United States got along just fine without federal art
subsidies, which are a product of the Great Society's massive
government expansion.   Also, NEA funds are distributed in a grossly
distorted fashion, with certain areas such as New York, Los Angeles
and Minnesota receiving far more money than other states and cities.
 And many grants go to artists who are already successful and
do not need the money.  Finally, ending federal subsidies would
put a dent in cultural imperialism; pampered artists could no
longer use the federal government to tell the rest of the nation
what is art and what isn't.  Pulling the plug on NEA money would
mean that communities would support the arts that the people in
those communities wanted -- not the art that is dictated from
Washington, D.C.

<P>
Over the past decade, the federal government has spent billions
of dollars on HIV research, which has been geared predominantly
toward end-stage HIV (full-blown AIDS).  In Fiscal Year 1995,
the U.S. Public Health Service will spend $2.7 billion directly
on AIDS, the highest expenditure for any of the nation's 10 most
lethal diseases.[1]
<P>
AIDS ranks near the bottom of the list of the top 10 mortal diseases
and accounts for about 35,000 deaths annually.  Heart disease
claims 720,000 lives annually, and cancer kills 505,000.  Yet
the federal government will spend more on AIDS than on heart disease
($828 million) and cancer ($2.4 billion).[2]
<P>
The point is not that AIDS should cease receiving attention. 
HIV is a contagious disease and its victims deserve compassion
and help.  Funding should continue for treatment, prevention and
care.  However, AIDS funding must be brought into line with expenditures
for other life-threatening diseases, and the money must be redirected
toward more effective approaches.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>A CHANGING EPIDEMIC</CENTER></H3>
<P>
The scourge of AIDS, which began in America among white, male
homosexuals, has moved into poor, minority communities, driven
by prostitution, drug abuse and promiscuous sex.  Yet most AIDS
funding is still directed by, for and to the original target population.
<P>
AIDS funding generally is allocated according to the numbers of
people who ever have contracted AIDS -- including those who already
have died -- not those currently diagnosed with HIV.  This formula
has, for example, directed money to white, homosexual AIDS groups
in San Francisco while cities which now may have greater numbers
of HIV-infected patients get less financial aid.  The CDC has
reported that 55 percent of AIDS cases in 1993 came from minority
communities, with blacks having the worst rate of all the groups.[3]
Black women were approximately 15 times more likely than white
women to get AIDS, and black men were five times more likely to
get AIDS than white men.[4]
<P>
For many years, AIDS policy has been driven by the demands of
HIV-infected people who dominate AIDS organizations.  Their situations
are tragic, and their focus on finding a cure is understandable.
 But because of their considerable influence, the lion's share
of AIDS funding has been spent for treatment of end-stage HIV
(AIDS) and not on the full spectrum of HIV disease. 
<P>
Even the prevention efforts have been tailored toward protecting
the identities of those with HIV rather than toward measures that
have proven effective in stemming other serious epidemics.  Much
government time at AIDS conferences has been spent on perfecting
&quot;nonjudgmental&quot; vernacular, such as substituting &quot;people
living with HIV&quot; for the word &quot;victim&quot; or even
the word &quot;patient&quot; in order to reduce stigma.  In the
same vein, concern for confidentiality, while important, has been
overemphasized, and sound medical procedures have been thwarted
and often ignored.  The first step in stopping an epidemic is
identifying, on a confidential basis, those who have the disease.
 This process has been hampered by federally-funded AIDS activists,
who have defeated efforts to increase early diagnosis and confidential
partner notification, the surest ways to pinpoint the disease
and to help check its spread. 
<P>
Furthermore, the federal government's preventative response to
the epidemic has consisted largely of a million-dollar ad campaign
promoting condoms and hundreds of millions of dollars for AIDS
education that targets schoolchildren, acquainting them with graphic
materials explaining the various ways AIDS is transmitted, whether
they are at risk or not.  At the same time, populations that are
most at risk for HIV transmission are under-served, particularly
in black or Hispanic communities.
<P>
The current premise of many AIDS prevention efforts is that <I>uninfected</I>
persons have primary responsibility for stemming the epidemic,
not those already infected.  The focus must be changed to make
personal responsibility on the part of those infected the foundation
of future programs. 
<P>
The most successful AIDS eradication program in America has been
run by the U.S. armed forces.  Early diagnosis is the key.  Since
1985, every member of the military has been screened regularly
for HIV, resulting in a depth of knowledge about the disease that
is unparalleled.  Unlike civilian doctors, military medical personnel
are not &quot;flying blind&quot; in this epidemic and are getting
early treatment and notification to those affected.  There is
no &quot;AIDS epidemic&quot; in the military because aggressive
knowledge-based intervention prevents the spread of disease.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>IDEAS FOR POLICY MAKERS</CENTER></H3>
<P>
Here are some proposals to overhaul federal AIDS programs, with
thanks to Americans for a Sound AIDS/HIV Policy, a nonpartisan
Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group, for their
wise counsel on several of these points: 
<P>
<LI><B>Initiate prenatal HIV testing for all pregnant women</B>,
with an opt-out for those who want it.  Twenty-six percent of
HIV-infected mothers transmit the disease to their babies today
in the United States.  However, mothers who do not know they are
HIV-positive can unwittingly transmit it to the 74 percent of
uninfected babies by breast-feeding.  Furthermore, research shows
that when HIV-infected mothers are treated with the drug AZT,
the transmission rate drops from 26 percent to 8 percent.  Thus
knowledge of HIV status can save many lives.
<P>
<LI><B>Begin HIV partner notification programs in all 50 states,
the District of Columbia and U.S. territories</B>.  Partner tracing
is the fastest way to alert those in danger of infection and is
standard public health procedure for virtually all contagious
and sexually transmitted diseases.  Earlier this century, epidemics
of gonorrhea and syphilis were greatly reduced using this time-proven
procedure. 
<P>
<LI><B>Guarantee confidentiality to all who are tested.</B>  Concern
over misuse of HIV status has been the main obstacle to effective
testing programs.  But public health departments have reported
more than 400,000 cases of AIDS to the CDC without a single breach
of confidentiality in any of the 50 states.  Moreover, venereal
disease testing has been done for years without any serious breach-of-confidentiality problem. 
<P>
<LI><B>Overhaul the Ryan White Act</B>, which dispenses about $650
million annually in federal funds.  The Ryan White Act is due
to expire in 1995.  Hearings need to be held to examine how the
money is being spent.  And the spending formulas should include
the following changes:
<P>
1) Only those infected with HIV or AIDS who need care should receive
benefits.  Formulas based on &quot;AIDS prevalence&quot; distort
funding needs because they count the dead along with the living.
 Money ought to go where it is needed most, which is, increasingly,
to under-served minority communities.
<P>
2) People with HIV or AIDS should qualify where they are currently
living, not where they were diagnosed.  Slating funds to areas
of diagnosis misses areas where AIDS patients are actually residing.
 For example, someone might be diagnosed with AIDS in a large
city, but return home to a suburban or rural area for care.
<P>
3) Means testing for AIDS care dollars should be introduced. 
Those with adequate insurance should not be in the same pool with
those who truly have no other means of payment.
<P>
<LI><B>Overhaul HIV/AIDS education</B>, which now emphasizes condoms
and has not been shown to be effective.  In fact, programs seeking
funding renewal should be required to show evidence that they
have reduced HIV transmission. 
<P>
Sex education should be geared toward abstinence education and
knowledge of HIV status.  True abstinence programs (not those
that merely mention abstinence and then focus on contraception)
are the only sex education programs that have been proven to alter
behavior in positive ways.  &quot;Comprehensive&quot; (contraceptive-based)
programs have been proven to have either no effect or to actually
encourage earlier or more frequent sexual experimentation.  The
key to stopping AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases is
not in the promotion of condoms but in the promotion of delayed
sexual activity and early knowledge of infection.  In a recent
test, three groups of people were monitored: 1) a group who received
HIV education, 2) a control group with no HIV education and 3)
a group who received HIV education, and who also underwent an
HIV test.  Only the latter group registered any behavioral change.
 Testing in and of itself heightens consciousness of the seriousness
of premature or promiscuous sex.
<P>
The federal AIDS education campaign has emphasized condoms first
and has treated abstinence as a largely unrealistic goal, even
though medical experts agree that it is the most medically sound
response.  Condoms are seen by some as a way of continuing high-risk
behavior regardless of HIV status.  But no honest medical professional
would recommend that an uninfected person have sex with an HIV-infected
partner using a condom for protection.  Condoms can reduce the
risk in a single encounter, but not to where it is anywhere near
acceptable to be considered in the context of &quot;prevention.&quot;
<P>
The CDC has even misrepresented the concept of abstinence, stating
in its literature that there is a &quot;26 percent failure rate
for periodic abstinence.&quot;[5] What they are really describing
is &quot;periodic sex.&quot;  There is no such thing as &quot;periodic
abstinence.&quot;  To understand the absurdity of this statement,
try imagining the police describing a burglar as having a 26 percent
&quot;periodic honesty&quot; failure rate.  Funding for all federal
AIDS programs that promote condom use and misrepresent abstinence
should be halted immediately.  Sex education programs under Title
X (a program that was a colossal, $3 billion failure over two
decades) should be zeroed out.
<P>
<LI><B>Focus research on the &quot;full spectrum&quot; of HIV</B>,
from inception on, instead of merely focusing on HIV's final stage
(AIDS).  Dr. Robert Redfield of Walter Reed Hospital notes that
finding a &quot;cure&quot; for this tricky retrovirus is only
a distant possibility (and still a worthy goal), but that early
detection is the key to prevention.[6] Also, research subject pools
need to include more women and people from minority communities,
where the epidemic is increasing at the fastest rates.
<P>
<LI><B>Change the formula for the Centers for Disease Control's
prevention planning committees.</B> They are currently biased
toward white, homosexual men, although the HIV epidemic has shifted
toward minority communities.  Testing authorization should not
be limited to licensed phlebotomists but expanded to include small,
trained groups that can operate within minority communities inexpensively
and efficiently, using the Orasure saliva-test collection device
recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
<P>
<LI><B>Support distribution of the saliva-based HIV test</B>, approval
of which was held up for nearly four years by the FDA.  The test
is a reliable, inexpensive and convenient way to detect HIV. 
The sample is processed in a lab, so public health professionals
can track the epidemic when names are gained through confidential
testing.  Conversely, an<I> anonymous</I> home test backed by
AIDS activist groups would help &quot;drive the epidemic underground,&quot;
a concern voiced, ironically, by those same groups whenever the
testing issue is raised.  Anonymous home tests would discourage
people from being tested in a manner that fosters early counseling
and treatment and that could be tracked by public health professionals,
and it would severely limit the impact of partner-notification
programs that are under way in many states.  Furthermore, the
trauma of discovering that one has HIV infection, experienced
alone, could lead some to suicide. 
<P>
Although concerns of confidentiality are not to be taken lightly,
the idea of anonymous HIV testing is being driven by the notion
that the primary responsibility for the epidemic should fall on
those who are uninfected, not on those who have the virus.  
<P>
<LI><B>Require routine testing of patients and health care workers.
</B> Both parties should be notified of the results.  Ignorance
of infection has never aided the cause of good medical care. 
In many cases, women do not show early signs of HIV infection,
and the first indication comes when the patient is actually dying
of AIDS.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</CENTER></H3>
<P>
In testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in
1991, Dr. Robert Redfield said, &quot;The chilling reality is
that the AIDS epidemic of the next decade has already occurred.
 Central to the military response was the recognition of HIV infection
for what it is -- a sexually transmitted, progressively fatal
infection, which, although not yet curable, is treatable and preventable.&quot;
<P>
The AIDS epidemic of the year 2000, indeed, has occurred already.
 In fact, it took place around 1990.  The HIV virus' incubation
period typically takes 10 years, so when public policy makers
are addressing full-blown AIDS in 1995, they are dealing with
behavior and causes that occurred in 1985.  While care of AIDS
patients and basic AIDS research is essential, prevention efforts
need to be targeted toward current patterns of behavior and the
current population groups most adversely affected.  Homosexual
white males still account for the largest number of AIDS cases,
but the growth in HIV infections increasingly is among poor, black
and Hispanic urban dwellers, including women.  It's time to gear
the federal AIDS effort toward sound, time-tested medical procedures
such as early diagnosis, reporting and confidential partner notification,
and it's time to make individual responsibility the touchstone
of public policy.

Authorization for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is due
to expire at the end of 1996.  But Congress must appropriate money
each year.  The new 104th Congress should decline to do so. 
<P>
There is no reason Congress should force the taxpayers to continue
subsidizing this outdated system, much of which (the best parts)
would survive nicely without federal aid.
<P>
The CPB, overseer of the Public Broadcasting Service and National
Public Radio, was created in 1967 to meet a perceived need for
taxpayer-financed alternative programming not provided by commercial
networks.  That need, if there ever was one, has passed.  The
advent of cable television, satellite dishes and improved radio
technology has created an enormous menu of broadcasting choices
for consumers.  America has more than 11,700 radio stations and
more than 3,100 television licensees, plus 109 cable networks[1]
and another 6,963 translators and boosters, which extend the reach
of existing stations.[2] In addition, computer technology has created
a multitude of interactive computer highways, such as the Internet.
 It is not as if consumers don't have enough access to information.
<P>
The basis for CPB's existence has always been an anti-free market
philosophy.   Proponents have said that the market is incapable
of providing good programming, so the government must step in
and do it, to the tune of $285.6 million annually.[3] This insults
the intelligence of the viewing/listening public, because it assumes
they won't appreciate or support good programming.  Yet the shows
that register high ratings on PBS turn out to be the very programs
that the public perceives to be excellent: <I>Sesame Street</I>,
<I>Barney and Friends</I>, <I>The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour</I>,
and <I>Masterpiece Theatre</I>, for example.  All of these shows
are generating more than sufficient revenue from sponsors, donors,
grants and product marketing.  They do not need taxpayer subsidies.
But there is other CPB programming that probably would fail to
attract a sufficient viewing/listening audience or donor support.
 These programs are so bad that their creators must dig into the
public purse.  Subsidizing bad art is a donor's prerogative, of
course -- unless the &quot;donor&quot; is the taxpayer, who has
no choice.  
<P>
In a time of massive federal deficits, it makes no sense to require
taxpayers to shell out their hard-earned dollars for art of any
kind.  And the CPB, like any government bureaucracy, has waste
built into it.  A Congressional Conference Report on the Public
Broadcasting Service discloses that &quot;a single individual
is paid $438,000 annually for his once a week 30 minute appearance.&quot;[4]
<P>
It also makes no sense when cable television and satellites are
providing hundreds of programming alternatives.  Anything that
is worth viewing on PBS, for instance, would be picked up by Bravo,
The Learning Channel, the Arts &amp; Entertainment Network and
other channels. 
<P>
Public broadcasting advocates acknowledge that major PBS and NPR
stations would continue to thrive without federal subsidies. 
Their concern, they say, is that smaller, rural stations would
be forced to close.  But rural radio listeners or TV viewers can
tune in to numerous commercial stations or even to National Public
Radio or Public Broadcasting Service stations in distant cities
merely by acquiring better equipment.  Would it really be a great
loss if rural folks were denied the ability to see <I>Tongues
Untied</I> on their own, local station? Living in the country
has its own rewards, but forcing other taxpayers to subsidize
money-losing operations and bad art should not be one of them.
<P>
Besides, there is no public clamor from rural people or suburbanites
or urban dwellers, for that matter, to continue to subsidize the
pet projects (and paychecks) of a small radical elite that is
at odds with most American values.  The case for CPB subsidies
is being made almost exclusively by those in &quot;the arts community&quot;
and radical political activists who stand to benefit directly
from taxpayer largesse.  A case in point is a recent letter from
Independent Television Service Executive Director James Yee to
public broadcasting advocates.  The taxpayer-supported (and, therefore,
in no way independent) ITVS was created in 1988 to provide new
programming for public broadcasting.  Yee urges his &quot;independent
colleagues&quot; to &quot;become involved in future efforts to
drum up support for public broadcasting, especially with your
local and national elected officials, local public broadcasting
station(s), media arts organizations, and civic and cultural institutions.&quot;[5]
Yee warned that &quot;an extensive informational outreach campaign
will have to be waged,&quot;[6] which means newspapers and broadcasters
will begin pelting their audiences with scary stories about the
demise of Big Bird, should budget cutters prevail.   
<P>
But the debate over CPB is not about grounding Big Bird.  Through
PBS and NPR, the CPB is peddling a political and social agenda
that is offensive to many.  For example, NPR reporter Sunni Khalid
revealed more than a bit of political bias when commenting on
the Republican Congressional victory during a C-Span <I>Journalists
Roundtable</I> (C-Span is not funded by CPB, but by America's
cable TV operators): &quot;I think there's a big difference when
people told Father Aristide to sort of moderate his views, they
were concerned about people being dragged through the streets,
killed and necklaced.  I don't think that is what [House Speaker]
Newt Gingrich has in mind.  I think he's looking at a more scientific,
a more civil way, of lynching people.&quot;[7]
<P>
The bright side is that few folks are tuning in to public broadcasting's
truly awful programs.   The bad side is that their money is being
used to produce shows that are used to validate attacks on them,
and then the same shows are foisted, in videocassettes, on unsuspecting
schoolchildren as &quot;educational&quot; supplements. 
<P>
Here are a few of the anti-family, anti-religious, pro-homosexual
offerings from public broadcasting in recent years:
<P>
<CENTER><H3>ANTI-FAMILY PROGRAMMING</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<LI>In July 1994, a mother in Akron, Ohio, was shocked to find a
program titled <I>What if I'm Gay</I> sandwiched between <I>Kidsongs
TV</I> and <I>Sesame Street</I> from 10:00 to 11:00 a.m. on her
local PBS station.  The mother's concern about placing such programming
at a time when many pre-school children and toddlers are watching
T.V. seems to have been largely ignored by the station.  After
the woman called the station to complain, the programming director
defended the show, saying, &quot;The quality of the program is
unquestionable.  It has good
writing and production and is well thought out.&quot;[8]
<P>
<LI>The Independent Television Service (ITVS) has been awarded more
than $38 million in public broadcasting funds since 1989.  For
that princely sum, according to public media watchdog <I>COMINT</I>
magazine, the public has received a mere nine hours of programming.
Perhaps this is a blessing, given ITVS's focus.  One five-hour
series called <I>Television Families,</I> for which ITVS (through
the taxpayers) ponied up $1.9 million, plans to feature &quot;tales
of more or less dysfunctional families&quot; which &quot;all fall
outside the mainstream.&quot; ITVS earlier had announced that
it is seeking programs that will &quot;test the boundaries, both
of form and content, that have defined the family's role on television.&quot;
 These include &quot;new alternative households, new patterns
for adoption and birth...new articulations of rights for children.&quot;
<P>
The anti-family agenda in this case is obvious.  It incorporates
and goes beyond <I>Murphy Brown's</I> glorification of single
motherhood.  The term &quot;alternative households&quot; is often
used to describe homosexual households and other non-traditional
households, putting them on the same moral plane as traditional
families.  &quot;New patterns for adoption and birth&quot; are
terms used to describe adoption of children by homosexuals and
artificial insemination.  &quot;Children's rights&quot; is the
anti-parent philosophy in which the state knows best when it comes
to handing out condoms, referring children to abortionists and
otherwise undermining the authority of parents. 
<P>
Another ITVS offering is <I>Dottie Gets Spanked</I>, a mockery
of 1950s American family life from the producer of the cult homosexual
films <I>Superstar</I> and <I>Poison</I>.  Yet another is <I>Terminal
USA</I>, described by the ITVS newsletter <I>Buzzwords</I> as
being about &quot;wholly unwholesome folks&quot; who &quot;cram
a lot of skeletons in their closet: drug abuse, homosexuality,
teen pregnancy, elderly abuse, unemployment, and infidelity (with
the pizza delivery boy) -- all under one roof.&quot; Making a
gratuitous slam on conservative Christians, <I>Buzzwords</I> concludes:
&quot;Unlike the absolute 'family values' of censorship-minded
evangelicals, <I>TV Families</I> values all kinds of families.&quot;[9]
<P>
<LI>In May of 1992 PBS broadcast a documentary called <I>What Kids
Want to Know About Sex and Growing Up</I>.  Produced by the Children's
Television Workshop, the show was an attack on traditional family
values in the guise of a pseudo-scientific presentation. 
<P>
The program contains graphic sexual information, aimed at children
as young as 8 years old.  Children are encouraged to use condoms
without being informed about high condom failure rates.  Abstinence
is given only a passing mention.  Parents are nearly invisible,
as are clergy or any other adults who would normally articulate
moral and familial ramifications of sexuality. 
<P>
Having a baby is illustrated through an exercise in which teens
carry around a bag of flour for a week and then talk about how
it cramps their style.  This exercise fails to take into account
the joys of parenthood.  It dehumanizes babies and subordinates
life itself to the cold sexual imperative. 
<P>
None of the instructors use the word &quot;marriage&quot; in any
context.  Sex is portrayed strictly as a physical act, without
the larger moral and social contexts that constitute the real
&quot;facts of life.&quot;  &quot;Husbands&quot; and &quot;wives&quot;
are not mentioned, just &quot;partners.&quot; This video is now
available in commercial video stores.
<P>
<LI>Children's Television Workshop also publishes <I>Sesame Street
Parents</I> magazine, which features an advice column by New York
University psychologist Lawrence Balter.   In the January/February
1994 issue, Dr. Balter advises parents that masturbation is a
&quot;tension-relieving activity that, much like hair twirling
and thumb-sucking, serves to soothe and calm children.  Masturbation
can also help a child learn more about his body and help him develop
positive attitudes toward sex....Avoid telling your son that touching
himself is 'not nice.'&quot;[10]
<P>
<LI>In 1992, the POV (Point of View) series began with <I>Color
Adjustment</I>, a documentary by homosexual writer and AIDS victim,
the late Marlon Riggs (see <I>Tongues Untied</I> item below),
who complained about the heterosexual bias of most family programming:
&quot;Have we exchanged the myths of pre-television America for
new fictions just as confining, for impossibly rigid, homogenized
fictions of the family, and the American dream....?&quot;[11]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>PRO-HOMOSEXUAL PROGRAMMING</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<LI>On January 5, 1995, National Public Radio's &quot;All Things
Considered&quot; ran what amounted to a promotion of homosexual
punk rock music, focusing on the new activist group Homocore.
 NPR reporter Rick Carr describes New York's Pansy Division as
&quot;one of hundreds of bands that infuse punk rock's do-it-yourself
aesthetic with gay themes.&quot;[12] 
<P>
<LI>In early 1994, PBS ran the miniseries <I>Tales of the City</I>,
a celebration of homosexuality in San Francisco during the 1970s.
 The series presents the homosexual lifestyle as superior to marriage
and family, with few apparent consequences from promiscuous sex
or illicit drugs.  The series is full of gratuitous nudity, crudity,
lewdness and foul language.  Traditional families are lampooned
through stereotypical caricatures of stupid fathers and meddling
mothers.  The only person dying from an incurable disease is a
heterosexual businessman who winds up cheating on his wife with
a transsexual.  Even an edited version of the series that ran
on Oklahoma public television caused a &quot;quite a bit of animosity
amongst a considerable number of legislators from rural areas,&quot;
Bob Allen of Oklahoma ETV told <I>Current</I>, a public broadcasting
trade journal.[13] The publication noted that <I>Tales</I> had also
drawn acclaim from critics and &quot;just about everywhere, local
outlets heard both praise and disapproval from viewers.&quot;[14]
<P>
<LI>In 1991, PBS aired a film documentary titled <I>Tongues Untied</I>.
 Written by ITVS grant recipient Marlon Riggs and shown under
the banner of POV, the documentary was so offensive that more
than 100 PBS stations refused to air it.  Still, many urban stations
did air the show, which contained full frontal nudity, bare buttocks
and 20 seconds of two men disrobing and having sex.
<P>
<LI>In June of 1992, PBS aired <I>The Lost Language of Cranes</I>
as part of Gay Pride Month.  The film features a father and son
&quot;coming out,&quot;  to declare their homosexuality.  The
movie also shows a man attempting to initiate anonymous sex with
a man in a homosexual porn theater.  Graphic scenes of homosexuals
kissing and engaging in sex are also featured.
<P>
Homosexual activists have acknowledged CPB's contribution to their
cause.  At a public hearing on CPB held in Washington, D.C. in
January 1994, Cathy Renna of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against
Defamation (GLAAD) congratulated CPB, which, she said, &quot;has
aired many documentaries, films, and series that have touched
on or dealt with gay issues.&quot; She urged CPB to &quot;continue
to bring as much gay-oriented programming as possible to the viewing
public without fear of reprisal or complaint.&quot;[15] At the same
hearing, Gregory King of the Human Rights Campaign Fund noted,
&quot;...the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, through your
support of National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service,
has had an important impact on the ability of lesbian and gay
Americans to emerge from the shadows of society into the sunlight
of American life.&quot;[16] He singled out NPR's <I>Morning Edition</I>,
<I>The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour</I> and the <I>Charlie Rose Show</I>,
which &quot;regularly include discussions with gay and lesbian
Americans on issues of public importance,&quot; and praised CPB
for its support of gay-themed programming, such as <I>In the Life</I>,
<I>The American Playhouse</I>, <I>Longtime Companion</I>, <I>Andre's
Mother</I>, <I>The AIDS Quarterly</I>, <I>The Lost Language of
Cranes</I>, <I>Silverlake Life: The View from Here</I> and Armistead
Maupin's <I>Tales of the City</I> for bringing &quot;gay and lesbian
concerns into the mainstream of American life, where they belong.&quot;[17]
<P>
What King failed to add is that these aforementioned programs
are loaded with homosexual activists' propaganda and ignore the
health consequences of homosexual behavior.  They also ignore
the existence of the burgeoning ex-gay movement, reserving that
topic for the smear show, <I>One Nation Under God</I>.  PBS' pro-homosexual
programs also typically screen out any knowledgeable opponents
of the gay rights movement. 
<P>
In closing, King urged CPB to &quot;continue to provide leadership
in using the airwaves...to break the bonds of bigotry.&quot;[18]
<P>
Speaking of bigotry, public broadcasting harbors the last respectable
form of bigotry in America: Christian bashing.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>ANTI-RELIGIOUS PROGRAMMING</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<LI>On September 6, 1993, National Public Radio's <I>All Things
Considered</I> chronicled a controversy in Colorado Springs. 
The story was about some parents who objected to their children
being baptized without their parents' knowledge during a local
church carnival.[19] The controversy was real, and the conflict compelling.
 However NPR's handling of the story was anything but evenhanded.
<P>
Opening remarks by the reporter implied that children are no longer
safe in Colorado Springs because of the presence of Christian
groups.  No spokesmen are included to combat the anonymous charge
that Colorado Springs is fraught with &quot;religious extremism.&quot;
 The story presented an organization named The Citizen's Project
as a &quot;liberal volunteer&quot; organization that promotes
communication and understanding between its members and conservative
Christians.  However, on another program aired on NPR, which was
also openly biased against Christians, the Citizen's Project is
described as a &quot;watchdog&quot; organization that gives citizens
a sense of belonging by &quot;organizing opposition to [the Christian]
agenda.&quot;
<P>
<LI>In October of 1993, NPR broadcast a documentary titled <I>The
Politics of Bigotry</I>.  Described as an &quot;in-depth investigation
of the Christian Right...,&quot; the show was actually an ugly
smear of Christians which violated the First Amendment protection
against infringement on the free exercise of religion.  
<P>
The two-and-a-half hour documentary contains many opinions presented
as if they were fact and gives Christians no opportunity to respond
to the majority of statements made by their detractors.
<P>
<LI>A segment of PBS's <I>Bill Moyers' Journal</I> titled <I>The
New Holy War</I>[20] was supposed to be a documentary about Colorado's
&quot;Amendment Two,&quot; a statewide ballot initiative which
would have prohibited political jurisdictions across the state
from granting special rights to homosexuals.  Instead it was an
anti-religious hit piece disguised as balanced journalism.  The
issue is framed in terms of a struggle between homosexuals, who
Moyers portrays as oppressed victims fighting for their rights,
and Evangelical Christians, who are pictured as intolerant bigots.
<P>
Moyers works hard to pass himself off as an objective journalist.
 However, he reveals his bias when he conducts an in-depth critical
look at an organization supporting Amendment Two without so much
as mentioning any one of the several organizations fighting against
it.  Also, Moyers fails to inform viewers of vote totals, the
percentage of evangelical Christians in the state, or that many
non-evangelicals supported Amendment Two.  Moyers charges, but
fails to present any evidence, that the conflict was strictly
between homosexuals and Christians.[21]
<P>
Moyers' greatest omission was his failure to present an accurate
portrayal of the homosexual lifestyle.  The show features male
and female homosexual couples who are clean cut, monogamous and
well-spoken.  While this image may be true of the couples featured
on the show, it is in sharp contrast with what the research tells
us about the homosexual lifestyle.  Research shows that male homosexuals
typically are quite promiscuous, with many sexual partners over
the course of a lifetime.  In addition, homosexuals are at high
risk for a host of sexually transmitted diseases and violence
within relationships.  Homosexual males typically and tragically
have shorter lifespans.[22]  Homosexuals are also more likely to have
drug and alcohol abuse problems.[23]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>RADICAL POLITICAL PROGRAMMING</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Ultra-left <I>Pacifica</I> radio, along with PBS's <I>Frontline</I>,
<I>Point of View</I> and dozens of PBS specials, have been criticized
for left-wing bias.  Some recent examples:
<P>
<UL><LI> In 1992, KPFK, the <I>Pacifica</I> station in Los Angeles, broadcast
an <I>African Mental Liberation Weekend</I>.  The 26-hour marathon
of speeches and interviews was called a &quot;hatefeast&quot;
by members of the L.A. Jewish community.[24] Speakers included Louis
Farrakhan, who said that whites and Jews were &quot;the pale horse
with death its rider and hell close behind.&quot;[25] The broadcast
also featured black supremacist Leonard Jeffries lecturing on
Jewish involvement in the slave trade and Steve Cokely, who evoked
a &quot;Jew doctors conspiracy to infect black children with AIDS.&quot;[26]
<P>
<LI>In May 1994, NPR announced plans to run prison-life commentaries
by convicted cop-killer and former Black Panther Mumia Abu-Jamal,
claiming that the show would bring a &quot;unique perspective
to listeners.&quot;[27] Although the show was canceled after Sen.
Robert Dole took to the Senate floor to decry CPB's lack of balance,
the incident raised serious questions about CPB's judgment and
commitment to balanced programming. 
<P>
<LI>Several specials have been broadcast which support totalitarian
and anti-American causes.  For example: <I>Maria's Story</I>,
a show about the war in El Salvador from the communist FMLN's
perspective and <I>Cuba in the Shadow of Doubt</I>, which was
described by a <I>New York Times</I> critic as having &quot;...a
romantic infatuation with Cuba.&quot;[28] Another example is a PBS
documentary on families divided over the Castro regime entitled
<I>Miami-Havana</I>.  The credits of the film contain a &quot;special
thanks&quot; to the Combinado del Este prison.  According to Alberto
Mora, a Cuban-American lawyer, &quot;no prison has a grislier
reputation than Combinado del Este.  Mind you, this notoriety
stands out even in the context of a prison system infamous for
its barbarism.&quot;[29]
<P></UL>
<CENTER><H3>NO NEED FOR SUBSIDIES</H3></CENTER>
<P>
In a truly free broadcasting market, programs of very limited
appeal would most likely not garner advertising support.  They
would be confined to media that are supported by those who seek
this information.  Left-leaning foundations and individual donors
might be persuaded to fund them, but they have little incentive
to do so while it is so easy to tap the taxpayers.
<P>
The programs mentioned above are not the examples that CPB supporters
cite when they complain that good programming would be lost without
CPB.  Instead, CPB advocates point to popular shows such as <I>Sesame
Street</I> and <I>The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour</I>.  They fail
to mention that the popular shows will fare well in free market
competition.  Children's Television Workshop, parent company of
<I>Sesame Street</I>, has a stock and bond portfolio worth more
than $51 million.[30] And gross merchandising sales of Sesame Street
items rack up $1 billion annually, earning CTW about $100 million
in royalties.[31] One divisional CTW president had an annual salary,
including bonuses, of $625,000.[32] 
<P>
CPB funding makes up only 14 percent of public broadcasting's
total budget.[33] Federal grants from other agencies, such as the
National Endowment for the Arts, make up another 5 percent.  The
rest comes from donors, businesses, foundations, state governments,
public colleges and universities, auction participants and private
colleges and universities.  All told, 49 percent of public broadcasting's
budget comes from taxpayers at all levels, but the direct federal
component makes up only 19 percent.[34]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Pulling CPB's tax-funded plug would force producers to take into
account the tastes of their audiences and would motivate public
broadcasters to look to their lucrative offspring, like Barney
or Bill Moyers, to contribute more to the collective coffers.
 The result? Good programming would continue to thrive, and the
offensive and meritless programs would likely go the way of that
other big bird, the dodo.  
<P>
It's time to zero-budget the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
 Big Bird should leave the nest of Big Government and fly on his
own.

TITLE X's FAMILY PLANNING FAILURE</H2>

<P>
Title X of the Public Health Service Act is a categorical grant
issued by the federal government to fund family planning projects
throughout the United States.  Enacted in 1970, Title X was supposed
to help reduce the unplanned pregnancy rate, especially in the
teenager population.  However, Title X has not only failed to
reduce the teenage pregnancy rate, but teenage reproductive health
has drastically worsened in every category.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>TITLE X'S IMPACT ON TEENAGE HEALTH</H3></CENTER> 
<P>
Over the lifetime of Title X, the number of teenage clients has
grown due to increases in both Title X funding and the overall
number of enrollees in Title X clinics.  Currently, an estimated
1.5 million Title X clients are teenagers, constituting approximately
one-third of the program's total clientele.  But even though more
teenagers are being exposed to these family planning &quot;services,&quot;
the rates of out-of-wedlock births, abortions, sexually-transmitted
diseases, and pregnancies have all risen significantly in the
teenage population since the program's inception.
<P><UL>
<LI><B>Out-of-wedlock births -- <I>Since the introduction
of Title X, the teenage out-of-wedlock birth rate has doubled.</B></I>
 The out-of-wedlock birth rate per 1,000 unmarried girls aged
15-19 rose from 22.4 in 1970 to 44.6 in 1992 (teen births have
declined since 1992).
<P>
This illegitimacy figure is especially important to note because
Title X advocates have sought to claim &quot;success&quot; by
pointing out that the overall teenage birth rate has declined.
 However, such a decline is only attributable to the decline in
<I>marital</I> births, <I>not</I> in illegitimate births.  In
1970, seventy percent of teenage births were marital; in 1991,
7 in 10 teenage births occurred <I>outside</I> marriage.
<P>
The same trend toward out-of-wedlock childbearing is evidenced
in the female population at large.  In 1970 when Title X began,
children living with one parent were more than four times as likely
to be products of divorce as they were to have been born out-of-wedlock.
 But by 1993, the Census Bureau reports found that American children
who live with one parent were almost equally divided between children
of divorce and those born to unmarried parents.
<P>
<LI><B>Abortions -- <I>Over the lifetime of Title X, the
teenage abortion rate has more than doubled.</B></I>  In 1972,
the abortion rate per 1,000 girls aged 15-19 was 19.1; in 1990,
the rate was 40.6.  While the abortion rate grew rapidly from
1972 to the early 1980s, the rate has apparently reached a plateau,
hovering between 40 and 43 abortions per 1,000 teenage girls over
the last 10 years.
<P>
While the rapid growth of the teenage abortion rate during the
early years of Title X is no doubt attributable, in large measure,
to the <I>Roe v. Wade</I> decision, the past decade's more stabilized
abortion rate cannot be viewed optimistically.  For during this
time, a rapid rise also occurred in out-of-wedlock births.
<P>
Interestingly, the women whom Title X clinics target -- low-income
women, minorities, and unmarried young people -- have the highest
abortion rates.  And, the Alan Guttmacher Institute reports that
half of all women having an abortion used a contraceptive method
in the month during which they conceived.
<P>
<LI><B>Sexually-Transmitted Diseases (STDs) -- <I>Sexually-transmitted
diseases among teenagers have increased dramatically despite the
fact that many Title X clinics provide both contraception and
STD screening.  In fact, teenagers now have higher rates of gonorrhea
than any other 5-year age group between 20 and 44.</B></I>  Currently,
one in four sexually experienced teenagers -- about 3 million
-- become infected with an STD every year.
<P>
For the first time ever, teenage girls have the highest gonorrhea
rates in the nation; teenage boys rank second.  The rate in adolescent
girls is 20 times higher than in women over 30, according to the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  Infectious
syphilis rates more than doubled among teenagers since the mid-1980s.
 Additionally, up to 15 percent of sexually experienced teenage
girls are infected with human papilloma virus, many of them carrying
a strain that can cause cervical cancer.  Chlamydia also has spread
explosively, currently infecting 22 percent of sexually active
girls and 10 percent of sexually active boys.  Finally, one in
five reported full-blown AIDS cases is diagnosed among people
in their 20s.  Due to the virus' long incubation period (about
10 years), most were adolescents when they were infected, according
to the CDC.
<P>
Sexually-transmitted diseases can lead to cancer, pelvic inflammatory
disease, ectopic pregnancy, infertility, and/or even death.  Estimates
from the general population indicate that between 100,000 and
150,000 women become infertile each year as a result of an STD,
and about 15 to 30 percent of the 2.3 million U.S. couples who
are infertile may be unable to conceive as a result of an STD.
 But beyond infertility, STDs also increase the likelihood of
contracting HIV.  According to some estimates, having an STD,
such as gonorrhea, increases by as much as 100 times the chance
of contracting HIV from an infected partner.
<P>
<LI><B>Pregnancies -- <I>Since the introduction of Title
X, the out-of-wedlock pregnancy rate among 15-to 19-year-old girls
has doubled.</B></I>  In the same time span, the <I>overall</I>
teenage pregnancy rate (marital and nonmarital) increased 23 percent,
climbing from 95.1 per 1,000 girls aged 15-19 in 1972 to 117.1
in 1990.  So not only did the overall teenage pregnancy rate increase,
but a greater proportion of these pregnancies are now out-of-wedlock.
 This trend is best evidenced by the growing rate of out-of-wedlock
births.  When Title X began, only 3 in 10 teen births were out-of-wedlock;
now 7 in 10 teen births occur outside marriage.
<P>
Despite the 23 percent increase in the overall teen pregnancy
rate, Title X advocates still claim &quot;success&quot; by stating
that &quot;fewer sexually experienced teenagers become pregnant
each year.&quot;  Advocates often remark that the pregnancy rate
among sexually experienced teenagers has decreased from 254 to
207 per 1,000 (19%) in the last two decades.  However, this figure
is derived from a statistical invention called the &quot;sexually
experienced teenage pregnancy rate&quot; (SETPR) which obscures
the disastrous changes in teenage sexual activity and ignores
the real indices of social health, i.e., the rates of teenage
pregnancy, abortion, out-of-wedlock births, and STDs.  The fact
is, a greater proportion of teenagers are sexually experienced
today than 20 years ago.
<P>
Consider the following hypothetical comparison of two nations,
Country A and Country B:
<p><pre><center>
<B>Country    # of teenage     # sexually     # pregnant    SETPR
          girls 15-19      active         annually           </B>
<P>
  A        1,000,000        500,000       200,000       400
  B        1,000,000        100,000       50,000        500
</center></pre><p>
In this straightforward example, Country B has a 25% higher &quot;sexually
experienced teenage pregnancy rate&quot; than Country A.  But
Country B has only one-fifth the sexual activity rate of Country
A and one-fourth of its teenage pregnancy rate.  In fact, it is
obvious that Country A can have a lower SETPR than Country B while
still having a higher sexual activity rate, a higher rate of STDs,
a higher number of pregnancies, and both four times as many abortions
and out-of-wedlock births as Country B!  SETPR may be of some
statistical interest at the margin, but as a measure of adolescent
well-being it is not merely useless, but grossly misleading.
</UL><P>
<CENTER><H3>TITLE X FUNDING</H3></CENTER>
<P>
By all accounts, teenage reproductive health has suffered under
Title X's watch.  Yet, incredibly, Title X programs continue to
receive <I>increased</I> government funding, currently reaching
an all-time high of $193 million for fiscal year 1995.  Why? 
Because there is <I>no</I> <I>accountability</I> or measure of
effectiveness connected to the funding of the program.  There
has never been an evaluation component included in the grants;
and in 1983, the Department of Health and Human Services discontinued
collecting client data.
<P>
The federal government is not only funding a failed program, it
is funding an <I>unauthorized</I> program.  Title X's funding
authorization officially expired in 1985, but the program continues
to receive federal dollars every year through inclusion in the
Labor/Health and Human Services Appropriations bill.
<P>
<B>PROHIBITION OF ABORTION</B> -- Section 1008 of Title X states
that &quot;none of the funds appropriated under this title shall
be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning.&quot;
 Yet many of the clinics which receive Title X funds perform abortions
in addition to providing other family planning services.  These
clinics creatively &quot;obey&quot; the prohibition by maintaining
separate budgets for abortion and family planning.  However, when
self-titled &quot;family planning&quot; clinics perform abortions
and refer clients for abortion when contraception fails, an implicit
assumption exists that abortion is indeed a method of family planning.
 Additionally, many Planned Parenthood (PP) clinics receive Title
X funds.  And while not all of these PP clinics perform abortions,
Planned Parenthood's reputation as an abortion provider is undisputable.
 Thus, to the client, no relevant distinction is made between
abortion and family planning; in fact, the prohibition has been
reduced to a mere bookkeeping formality.  Such a misuse of the
statute must be immediately halted and the integrity of the prohibition's
original intent restored.
<P>
<CENTER> <H3>TEENAGE SEXUAL ACTIVITY AND CONTRACEPTIVE USE</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Poor teenage reproductive health outcomes and Title X funding
are clearly correlated.  But the question that begs to be answered
is, &quot;What accounts for the correlation?  What effect do contraceptive
counseling and dispensing have on teenagers' sexual behavior?&quot;
 While such questions cannot be answered easily, there are clues
which point in a common direction.
<UL><P>
<LI>Sexual activity rates among teenagers are higher now than ever
before.  Currently, fifty-six percent of girls and 73 percent
of boys have intercourse before age 18, compared to 35 percent
and 55 percent in the early 1970s.
<P>
<LI>A 1993 <I>Public Health Reports</I> article found that adolescent
males who had been instructed in sexual biology and birth control
were at a higher risk of early first intercourse than were those
who had received no instruction.
<P>
<LI>Research from Planned Parenthood shows that the number one reason,
by far, that teenagers initiate sexual activity is peer pressure.
 By promoting contraceptive use among teenagers, Title X clinics
reduce the number of outside forces bolstering teenagers' resolve
to save sex for marriage.
</UL><P>
<B>MULTIPLE PARTNERS</B> -- According to the Centers for Disease
Control, &quot;The initiation of sexual intercourse early in life
is associated with an increased number of sex partners and a greater
risk for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).&quot;  Data show
that one-half of sexually experienced teenage girls wait almost
18 months between first intercourse and having sex with a second
sexual partner; another one-fourth wait almost 2 years.  Thus,
helping teenagers to delay sex initiation is especially important.
<P>
However, evidence also indicates that <I>contraceptive use leads
to increased sexual activity, with a greater number of partners.</I>
 Consequently, the dispensing of prescription contraceptives without
parental involvement by family planning clinics would serve to
exacerbate this trend -- which is, in fact, what is happening
today.
<UL><P>
<LI>Among sexually active girls aged 15-17, 55 percent have had
2 or more partners and 13 percent have had at least 6.
<P>
<LI>Between 1971 and 1988, the percentage of sexually experienced
women aged 15-19 living in urban areas who reported 4 or more
sex partners increased from 14% to 31%.
<P>
<LI>Forty-five percent of 15-24-year-olds who had initiated sexual
intercourse before age 18 reported having had four or more partners;
75 percent reported having had two or more partners.
<P>
<LI>Dr. Robert Kistner of Harvard Medical School, one of the developers
of the oral contraceptive, subsequently acknowledged that use
of contraceptives among teenagers is stimulating higher levels
of promiscuity:  &quot;About ten years ago I declared that the
pill would not lead to promiscuity.  Well, I was wrong,&quot;
he said (<I>Family Practice News</I>, 1977).
</UL><P>
<B>CONTRACEPTIVE FAILURE</B> -- Not only does contraceptive use
lead to increased sexual activity with a greater number of partners,
but contraception is not terribly effective at protecting teenagers
from unplanned pregnancy and/or STD infection.  Indeed, one-third
of teenage pregnancies occur <I>while a contraceptive is being
used</I>, and this figure does not even take into account the
STD transmission rate.
<P>
In part, this is due to the fact that no contraceptive method
is highly effective in protecting simultaneously against pregnancy
and infection.  Contraceptives with the best record for reducing
pregnancy risk offer little, if any, protection against STDs.
 On the other hand, condoms have a standardized failure rate of
15.7 percent at preventing <I>pregnancy</I> over the course of
a year; in teenagers, the rate is even higher.  In addition to
a poor contraceptive record, condoms have not been shown to be
effective at protecting women against STD infection.  A recent
<I>Family Planning Perspectives</I> article found that condoms
may protect women against some STDs, but the data are equivocal.
 In several studies, condoms showed no protective effect against
cervical human papilloma virus, chlamydia, or bacterial vaginosis
in women.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>MATERNAL AND INFANT MORTALITY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Maternal and infant mortality might not seem, at first glance,
to be related to a discussion of Title X's impact on teenagers;
but, in reality, the two concepts are inextricably connected.
 Title X's mandate is to reduce maternal and infant mortality
and to promote the health of mothers and children.  However, Title
X has miserably failed in fulfilling this mandate.  America ranks
24th in the world in infant survival, a very low ranking for a
developed country, let alone the wealthiest country in the world.
 And the problems associated with Title X -- out-of-wedlock births,
teenage pregnancies, and STDs -- are major factors undermining
maternal and infant health.
<UL><P>
<LI><B>Out-of-wedlock births</B> -- Nicholas Eberstadt and others
have shown that marital status at birth is the key indicator for
infant mortality, transcending both ethnicity and poverty.  And
the out-of-wedlock teenage birth rate has soared under Title X's
watch.
<P>
<LI><B>Teenage pregnancy</B> -- One major cause of infant mortality
is low birth weight, which is directly related to teenage pregnancy.
 Thus it comes as no surprise that Title X's failure to reduce
teenage pregnancy would also result in higher infant mortality.
<P>
<LI><B>Sexually-transmitted diseases</B> -- As was discussed earlier,
STDs have a negative impact on women's health, possibly leading
to cancer, infertility, and even death.  Ectopic pregnancies,
which can be caused by STDs, have quadrupled since 1970, and the
rate of infertility among women has also dramatically increased.
 But in addition to women, STDs hurt infants.  The infection of
infants from the mother's STDs (including, but not limited to
HIV) has become a significant problem and will only continue to
worsen as nonmarital sexual activity remains unchecked.
</UL><P>
<CENTER><H3>FRC RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING TITLE X</CENTER></H3>
<P>
<B>(1)</B>  <B>Remove all funding from Title X</B> -- Title X
has not only failed to reduce the rates of teenage pregnancy,
out-of-wedlock births, and sexually-transmitted diseases, it has
exacerbated these problems.  The program's lack of evaluation
criteria and its approach as an open-ended project grant have
frustrated accountability.
<P>
Title X does not deserve to continue receiving taxpayer dollars
and, in fact, <I>should</I> not be receiving federal dollars,
as an unauthorized program.  The federal government has a responsibility
to use federal funds wisely, and it should not be funding programs
which, by all accounts, have produced worsened health outcomes.
<P>
<B>(2)</B>  <B>If Title X comes up for reauthorization, do not
reauthorize</B> -- Title X's authorization expired in 1985.  And
Title X should remain unauthorized because it has never been shown
to benefit the American public.
<P>
<B>(3)</B>  <B>Promote saving sex for the context of marriage</B>
-- If the federal government must play a role in &quot;family
planning,&quot; it ought to promote the optimum health message
-- that sex should be saved for marriage.  Research shows that
people who postpone sexual activity until marriage and practice
monogamy within marriage are more likely to be sexually satisfied,
to have enduring marriages, and to be free from the ravages of
out-of-wedlock pregnancies and sexually-transmitted diseases.

<P>
Adoption is a good choice and sound policy.  And now it is finally
receiving some well-deserved attention by Congress.  Under consideration
are two laudable reform proposals which would make it easier for
more people to choose adoption.
<P>
(1) <B>Reducing financial obstacles</B> -- The House GOP's Contract
with America includes the Family Reinforcement Act, of which adoption
assistance is a primary component.  This proposal would make adoption
a more affordable choice for prospective adoptive parents by allowing
a tax credit of up to $5,000 for qualified adoption expenses.
 These expenses could include adoption fees, court costs, attorney
fees, and other expenses which are directly related to the legal
adoption of the child.  Appropriately, the legislation explicitly
excludes payments to surrogate mothers and to individuals adopting
their spouse's children.
<P>
(2) <B>Reducing legal (and psychological) barriers -- </B>As
a proposed amendment to the welfare reform bill, the National
Council for Adoption has suggested that unmarried mothers who
place their babies for adoption should be exempted from provisions
which require welfare recipients to identify the father of the
child as a condition of receiving assistance.  The proposal recognizes
paternal rights by giving fathers a period of up to thirty days
after the child's birth to come forward and claim custody of the
child.  Should the father fail to do so, his rights would be terminated,
and the child would be eligible for adoption.  This proposal should
be reviewed as a possible alternative to single parenthood that
increases the incentive for unwed mothers to choose adoption.
<P>
These proposals are laudable because they encourage adoption --
a beneficial option for the birthmother, the adopted child, and
the adoptive parents.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>BENEFITS OF ADOPTION FOR THE CHILD</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Adoption holds many benefits for the child involved.  Recently,
the Search Institute conducted the largest U.S. study of adopted
adolescents and their families to evaluate the mental health of
these adolescents at a time when they are forming their identities.
 This study, combined with other research, found that adopted
adolescents reap the following benefits:
<P>
<UL><LI><B>A Loving, Intact Family</B> -- Ninety percent of adopted
children live with married parents, and these families exhibit
high levels of warmth, communication, discipline, and cohesion.
 Indeed, the Search Institute's representative sample found that
only 11 percent of adopted adolescents report divorce or separation
compared to 28 percent in a national survey of adolescents.
<P>
<LI><B>Deep Child-Parent Attachment</B> -- Adopted adolescents
are as deeply attached to their parents as are their non-adopted
siblings.  Fifty-four percent report strong attachment to both
parents; another 30 percent are deeply attached to one parent.
 Equally compelling is the fact that 95 percent of parents experience
strong attachment to their adopted child.
<P>
<LI><B>Strong Self-Identity</B> -- Most adopted adolescents have
a strong self-identity, exhibiting higher levels of self-esteem
than their peers.  They accept their adoptive status with relative
ease and are as likely to report a positive self-identity as their
non-adopted siblings.
<P>
<LI><B>Positive Psychological Health</B> -- Based on multiple
indices of psychological health, the study found that at least
three-quarters of adopted adolescents are within the zone of positive
psychological health, even surpassing a comparison sample of public
school adolescents on several measures.
<P>
<LI><B>Financial Provision</B> -- Fifty-four percent of adopted
children live in homes with family income three times higher than
poverty level.
</UL><P>
<CENTER><H3>BENEFITS OF ADOPTION FOR THE SINGLE MOTHER</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Research shows that young, unmarried women who choose adoption
for their babies reap many personal benefits.  Comparing favorably
to their counterparts, who choose single parenthood, women who
choose adoption exhibit the following characteristics.  They are:
<P>
<UL><LI>More likely to complete high school and advance further educationally.
<LI>More likely to be employed and have a higher income.
<LI>Less likely to live in poverty.
<LI>Less likely to receive public assistance than birth mothers
who chose to parent out-of-wedlock.  In fact, 60 percent of welfare
recipients are, or were at one time, teenage mothers.
<LI>More likely to marry subsequently.
<LI><B>Less likely to have a repeat out-of-wedlock pregnancy</B>
than the teenagers who choose parenting or abortion.
</UL><P>
<CENTER><H3>THE NEED FOR ADOPTION POLICY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Adoption provides children with the benefits of solid, two-parent
homes while giving birthmothers the opportunity to mature before
taking on the adult responsibilities of childrearing.  That policy
should encourage adoption as a positive alternative for women
facing crisis pregnancies seems especially prudent during this
time when our nation's rates of out-of-wedlock pregnancy, abortion,
and single parenthood are skyrocketing.
<P>
<UL><LI><B>Illegitimacy</B> -- Births to unmarried teenagers continue
to escalate dramatically.  In 1992, there were 365,000 out-of-wedlock
teenage births -- a six-fold increase since 1950.  But even in
the population at large (not limited to teenagers), illegitimacy
is rampant.  Thirty percent of all our nation's children were
born to unwed mothers in 1991; in the black community, the figure
was an astounding 68 percent.
<P>
<LI><B>Single Parenthood</B> -- The number of children being raised
in single-parent homes is rapidly rising.  In 1970, 7.5 million
children lived in single, female-headed homes; by 1993, the figure
had more than doubled to 15.6 million.  In fact, over 27 percent
of all children under 18 live in single-parent homes (1993).
<P>
<LI><B>Abortion</B> -- Abortion is strongly linked to unwed pregnancy.
 Indeed, unmarried mothers account for 70 to 80 percent of the
1.5 million abortions performed on U.S. women; 406,000 abortions
were obtained by teenagers in 1992.  Thus, helping to make adoption
a more viable option could mean (1) fewer abortions, including
repeat abortions, and (2) many women being spared from experiencing
the trauma of post-abortion syndrome.
<P>
<LI><B>Poverty</B> -- Regardless of race or socioeconomic background,
a high correlation exists between single parenthood and poverty.
 Of all children under age 6 living in poverty, 61 percent are
from single-parent families (1992).  In fact, children under age
6 from single-parent households are more likely to live in poverty
than not.
<P>
<LI><B>Breaking the cycle</B> -- For the child of a single parent,
the statistical odds of becoming an unwed mother later in life,
or fathering a child out-of-wedlock, are staggering.  One study
found that 80 percent of the girls who were mothers at 15 were
themselves daughters of teenage mothers.  Adoption can help break
that cycle.
</UL><P>
The American public overwhelmingly supports adoption policy. 
A recent Family Research Council survey of 1,000 Americans found
that, by a margin of 3-to-1, respondents favor efforts &quot;to
make it easier for children born out-of-wedlock to be adopted.&quot;
 And when presented with four options to resolve out-of-wedlock
teenage pregnancies, 33 percent of respondents thought it best
to &quot;have the child and put it up for adoption;&quot; 25 percent
thought it best for the mother &quot;to marry the child's father
and have the child;&quot; 13 percent thought it best for the mother
&quot;to have the child and raise it by herself;&quot; and only
10 percent thought it best for her to have an abortion.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>THE CURRENT STATUS OF ADOPTION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Even though most people agree that adoption is a good choice,
few exercise that option.  Only 6 percent of all teenage mothers
choose adoption for their babies; in the black community, adoption
accounts for less than one percent.  So while the number of potentially
adoptable children is theoretically large due to the high numbers
of out-of-wedlock births and crisis pregnancies, there remains,
ironically, a shortage of children.  An estimated one to two million
prospective parents are <I>still waiting to adopt a child</I>.
<P>
Perhaps one of the reasons why so few unwed mothers choose adoption
for their babies is that adoption frequently is not presented
to women as a viable choice.  One study found that nearly 40 percent
of pregnancy counselors fail to include adoption as an option
in their counseling.  Even worse, the counselors had a 40 percent
rate of uncertainty and inaccurate knowledge about adoption. 
Incredibly, some pregnancy counselors who thought adoption would
be a good choice still failed to present it as an option, because
they thought the girls would not want to hear about it.
<P>
Consequently, the number of adoptions reflects the lack of attention
adoption has received.  The latest available data show that 51,157
unrelated adoptions (adoptions by people not related to the child
by blood or marriage) of American children occurred in 1986. 
Of these 51,000-plus domestic adoptions, approximately one-half
were adoptions of healthy infants (under 2 years of age) of all
races and ethnic backgrounds.  The remaining adoptions were of
older kids or of children with special needs, i.e., physical,
mental, or emotional disabilities, part of a sibling group, etc.
<P>
In addition to the adoption of American children, there were 10,097
foreign-born children adopted by Americans in 1987.  However,
due to a decrease in the number of adoptions of South Korean children,
this figure has since declined to an estimated 6,500 adoptions
in fiscal year 1992.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>FURTHER POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Because of adoption's many benefits for both mother and child,
enabling more women to choose adoption should be a policy priority.
 Thus, in addition to the two proposals discussed earlier, the
Family Research Council recommends the following measures to make
the promotion of adoption more comprehensive.
<P>
(1)  Protocol for counseling women in crisis pregnancies should
include presentation of the adoption choice and its manifold benefits.
 This protocol should be used by counselors regardless of their
place of employment, i.e., crisis pregnancy centers, public health
facilities, and abortion clinics.  Inherent in this recommendation
is the expectation that such counselors would be properly trained
and adequately informed about the adoption option.  Furthermore,
the development of maternity homes should also be encouraged as
a way to promote adoption, as such homes have higher rates of
relinquishment than do other facilities.
<P>
(2)  The Department of Health and Human Services should collect
data on all adoptions, both public and private.  Currently, the
federal government only tracks adoption through the public system,
and the data available on the private sector is both limited and
outdated.  Data collection would also be enhanced through the
use of uniform data collection measures in each of the states.
 In addition to tracking the number of adoptions, the federal
government should encourage social science research regarding
adoption's impact on adopted children, birthmothers, and adoptive
parents.  This would not only add to the slim body of knowledge
already existing, it would also heighten awareness of the adoption
choice.
<P>
(3)  Reduce the barriers for prospective parents to choose adoption.
 This would include removing the obstacles hindering transracial
adoptions, reforming the insurance code to guarantee coverage
for adopted special-needs children, and speeding up the process
by which foster children could be adopted.

<P>
The American Psychiatric Association is a leading private, clinical
professional organization.  Over the years, the APA increasingly
has promoted greater acceptance of homosexuality.  And now, some
APA members are trying to outlaw counseling to homosexuals who
desire to change their orientation.
<P>
The association's pro-homosexual position is not shared by some
of its own members, and it offends many people of faith.  For
example, APA member Dr. Roy H. Hart writes from a Jewish perspective
in <I>Psychiatric News</I> that organized psychiatry does not
choose to understand religion's aversion to homosexuality.  He
writes in the May 1994 edition, &quot;Americans have the highest
rate of church attendance and membership in the Christian world,
but psychiatrists contribute little to those statistics.  What
is ego-alien for the psychiatrist -- religion -- is the center
of existence for a vast segment of the population.&quot;[1]
<P>
APA President John McIntyre tried to bridge the chasm with religion
when, after a pilgrimage to the epicenter of Mormonism, Salt Lake
City, he commented on the &quot;improved dialogue between religion
and psychiatry.&quot;[2]
<P>
The bridge McIntyre began to build in 1994 is now crumbling with
the advent of the January 1995 issue of the <I>American Journal
of Psychiatry</I>, the APA's official publication.  That issue
contains an article by Franklin D. Jones and Ronald J. Koshes,
&quot;Homosexuality and the Military&quot; which adds salt to
an old wound.[3] The article is noteworthy for its poor review of
research.  Its quick initial turn-around along with its array
of revisions suggests that the <I>AJP</I> editorial staff ignored
normal review procedures in order to publish a politicized article.
<P>

<CENTER><H3>"HOMOSEXUALITY AND THE MILITARY"</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B>1. Underwent an unusual review process.</B>  The article
was received by the <I>AJP</I> staff on July 14, 1993.[4] It was
subsequently revised four times before it was accepted June 17,
1994.[5] The first revision was received within four months, a very
brief time for this internationally recognized journal.  Following
the initial review there were at least three more revisions, suggesting
an unusual review process -- more like a dialogue than a peer-review
process.  In typical peer review, one or at most two revisions
are allowed. 
<P>
<B>2. Misrepresents the history of the military's homosexual
policy.</B>  The authors claim that the Pentagon's policy was
first formalized in 1982, and that the ban dates back to World
War II.[6] But the policy was formalized by President Carter and
became effective on January 16, 1981.  It was revised and updated
January 28, 1982.
<P>
The military's homosexual policy dates back to the British Articles
of War in 1775.  An individual was drummed out of the Continental
Army for attempted sodomy in 1778.[7] Prior to WW II, the legal
construction of the Articles of War and Army regulations were
broader in nature than today's.  Homosexual misconduct was prosecuted
under the categories of &quot;conduct unbecoming an officer&quot;
or, for enlisted members, &quot;conduct to the prejudice of good
order and military discipline.&quot;  After 1900, individuals
were punished for committing homosexual acts, which were lumped
under the rubric of sodomy.[8]
<P>
A WW I War Department circular, signed by the Surgeon General
in 1917, listed homosexuality as cause for rejection under the
category of &quot;psychopathic&quot; characteristics.[9] The 1921
enlistment standards included an implied homosexual policy excluding
people thought to be homosexual.[10] The right to make decisions
concerning the retention of enlisted men was delegated to relatively
low levels.  Discharges for &quot;inaptness or undesirable habits
or traits of character&quot; were handled under Section 8, Army
Regulation 615-360.[11]
<P>
The War Department's 1941 policy, which was harsher than previous
ones, emphasized that homosexual &quot;sodomists&quot; would not
be discharged but court-martialed.[12] Despite this increased penalty,
during the war there was an unofficial toleration of some homosexuals
because replacements were not guaranteed.  The policy was revised
in May, 1947 and, again, in 1949 to mandate that &quot;[h]omosexual
personnel, irrespective of sex, should not be permitted to serve
in any branch of the Armed Forces in any capacity, and prompt
separation of known homosexuals from the Armed Forces is mandatory.&quot;[13]
<P>
This fundamental was added to the Uniform Code of Military Justice
in 1951 with Articles 125 (act of sodomy) and 134 (assault). 
In September, 1958, Class III homosexuals (those who had committed
no homosexual act while in the military service) were furnished
honorable or general discharges based on the character of their
service.[14]
<P>
In the late 1970s, the Report of the Joint Service Administrative
Discharge Study Group recommended that the military reaffirm the
longstanding ban (indeed, it was more than 200 years old) on homosexuals
by incorporating into the policy the principled phrase, &quot;homosexuality
is incompatible with military service.&quot;  It also called for
the phrase, &quot;processing (for separation) is mandatory unless...the
allegations are groundless,&quot; to be included in all subsequent
Department of Defense (DoD) directives.  It also recommended some
leniency in cases of &quot;unsuitability,&quot; i.e., those involved
in homosexual tendencies or acts between consenting adults would
be honorably discharged.[15]
<P>
The 1982 policy cited in the <I>AJP</I> article incorporates the
aforementioned recommendations but was first published during
the last days of President Carter's administration.  That policy
was replaced by a law signed by President Clinton on November
30, 1993.  The Pentagon published implementing regulations on
February 28, 1994.
<P>
<B>3. Misrepresents the homosexual discharge history</B>.
 The authors cite homosexual discharge numbers and costs from
a discredited 1992 General Accounting Office study.[16] Other studies
show that the GAO underestimated the scope of homosexual discharges
and overestimated the costs to the government.
<P>
The GAO report stated that it costs the government $27 million
annually to discharge homosexuals.  But that figure is misleading.
 The military has a fixed number of authorized personnel, established
by Congress.  The projected annual number of enlistments is directly
related to the projected number of losses to achieve the established
end strength.  The cost to train new service members and to separate
other members is determined from the projected number of enlistments
and losses.  Those are sunk costs tied to running the training
base and a change of a few percent is of no real financial consequence.
<P>
Given the size of the military, the number of homosexuals discharged
is small.  For example, from 1980 through 1991, a total of 8,427,872
people served in the military.  During that same period there
were 17,840 non-judicial administrative discharges for homosexuality
--  .0021 percent of all of those who served during that period.
 An unpublished Army study during the same period puts homosexual
discharges in perspective.  It found there were 3,153 administrative
discharges for homosexuality between 1983 and 1991 but five times
(13,655) more for alcohol abuse and four times (10,845) more for
personnel being overweight.
<P>
The article also fails to mention homosexual punitive separations
which were not included in the GAO report.  A study obtained from
the Pentagon under the Freedom of Information Act analyzed 100
Army cases from 1989 to 1992.  Forty-nine percent of those cases
involved children as victims.  Eighty-five percent involved victims
who had not consented, and five percent of the offenders were
HIV-positive.[17]
<P>
The same report summarized a 1992 incident at Fort Hood, Texas,
where 60 homosexual men [soldiers and civilians] met in a public
toilet next to a child care center.  The men cut holes in the
walls to permit sex between men in adjacent stalls.  The men also
installed a mirror to allow them to see the approach of intruders.
<P>
These homosexuals were indiscriminate in their choice of partners
and often engaged in sex within moments of entering the bathroom.
 Sexual acts included oral and anal sodomy, mutual masturbation,
and fondling of the buttocks.  All soldiers in this incident received
disciplinary discharges which would not have been measured by
the 1992 GAO study.  This information was neither cited by GAO
nor by the <I>AJP</I> review.
<P>
<B>4. Relies on debunked Kinsey research to distort the
estimate of homosexuals in the military.</B>  The authors state,
&quot;Most authors feel this [4 percent exclusively homosexual]
is too conservative and that about 7 percent to 10 percent are
primarily homosexual in orientation.  Kinsey et al. also found
that 37 percent of males between childhood and old age had experienced
homoerotic orgasm, and another 13 percent claimed to have had
homoerotic stimulation without overt contact.  If these epidemiological
data are reliable, the policy of the Department of Defense would
severely limit the induction and retention of service members...strict
adherence to the Kinsey data and the policy of the Department
of Defense would result in the elimination of every other soldier
(37 percent plus 13 percent) in today's military.&quot;[18]
<P>
Alfred C. Kinsey, an Indiana University zoologist, who authored
<I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</I> in 1948, based his research
on 12,000 interviews.  Kinsey relied heavily on data gleaned from
criminals and extrapolated his findings to the general population.
 Psychologist Abraham Maslow said that Kinsey's work, like all
sex surveys, had a high margin of &quot;volunteer&quot; error
because many people are not honest or willing to talk about their
most intimate sexual secrets.[19] 
<P>
No reputable survey has replicated Kinsey's findings, and a number
of recent studies suggest that the homosexual population is considerably
less than 10 percent of the U.S. population.  For example, a 1991
national survey of sexually active adults done by the National
Opinion Research Center shows that 98.4 percent of adults were
exclusively heterosexual that year.[20] A 1993 survey by the Battelle
Human Affairs Research Centers found that only 1.1 percent of
all Americans are exclusively homosexual.[21] A survey conducted
by the Alan Guttmacher Institute in 1993 found that one percent
of men consider themselves exclusively homosexual.[22] And a 1994
National Health and Social Life Survey at the University of Chicago
found that 2.8 percent of men and 1.4 percent of women identified
themselves as homosexual or bisexual.[23]
<P>
A March 1994 article in the <I>American Journal of Psychiatry</I>
cites several surveys of American men showing the prevalence of
homosexuality.  For example, the National Survey of Men found
that only 1.1 percent of men have been exclusively homosexual
during the preceding 10 years.  Another study found that 2.4 percent
of men are currently homosexual.[24]
<P>
<B>5. Relies on outdated polls to indicate that the public
supports lifting the ban. </B>The article cites two surveys done
before the national debate to suggest that Americans now favor
lifting the ban.[25]  It does not cite surveys with contradictory
findings nor does it discuss these contradictions.
<P>
Public support for lifting the ban eroded as the debate intensified
in 1993.  Midway through the debate, support for lifting the ban
was no more than 40 percent.[26] A national poll by Fabrizio, McLaughlin
&amp; Associates in March 1993 found that a decisive 54 percent
to 37 percent of voters disagreed that President Clinton should
overrule military leaders such as General Colin Powell and require
the military to accept homosexuals.[27]
<P>
Most military personnel support the ban.  A February 1993 <I>Los
Angeles Times</I> survey found that 40 percent of service members
disapprove, on moral grounds, of lifting the ban and 46 percent
said lifting the ban would enter into their reenlistment decisions.
 Another 11 percent said flatly that they would not reenlist because
of it.[28] A February 1993 CNN/Gallup Poll found that 74 percent
of men who had not attended college opposed lifting the ban. 
This is the prime recruiting population.
<P>
In essence, this review selectively cites survey data to support
its position, implying that no other dissimilar results have been
found.  
<P>
<B>6. Ignores the law and relies on Clinton's inconsistent
policy.</B>  The article makes no mention of the military's homosexual
law which was signed by President Clinton on November 30, 1993.
 The authors suggest that the regulations will &quot;generate
a series of court cases based on the freedom of speech and self-incrimination
statutes of the U.S. Constitution.&quot;[29]
<P>
No doubt the new regulations will be contested in the courts.
 The fact that the law and the new regulations are inconsistent,
however, is significant.  This fact was ignored by the authors.
 Consider some of the problems:
<P>
<LI>The Clinton Administration interpreted the law to permit so-called
&quot;celibate&quot; homosexuals to serve.  This view, i.e., that
&quot;celibate&quot; homosexuals even exist, contradicts past
legal rulings and will lead to more homosexuals serving and fewer
investigations of their likely misconduct.
<P>
<LI>The regulations dropped the critical statement that &quot;homosexuality
is incompatible with military service.&quot;  While Congress has
carried this principle forward in the law, Secretary of Defense
William Perry failed to include it in the regulations.[30]
<P>
<LI>The new policy potentially cripples military discipline by creating
a number of new obstacles before investigations can be started.
 Thus the regulations prevent commanders from investigating soldiers
for homosexuality without clear evidence that they have done something
criminally wrong.  According to Perry, attending gay pride parades,
frequenting gay bars, and possessing gay materials are not &quot;credible&quot;
evidence to initiate an investigation.[31]
<P>
<LI>The &quot;Perry rules&quot; also prevent criminal investigation
agencies from looking into most cases of adult, private, consensual
sexual misconduct, e.g., sodomy and adultery.[32]
<P>
<LI>Under the Perry rules, and directly contrary to more than 200
years of military practice, the DoD no longer considers homosexual
or bisexual behavior a marker for increased security risk.  Questions
about homosexuality were removed from security background investigations,
and information discovered during a security investigation cannot
be used for adverse action without high-level political permission.[33]
<P>
Clinton's Pentagon appointees are now pointing to the constant
number of homosexual discharges as proof that the policy is fine
as implemented.[34] This is misleading.  Most homosexuals facing
discharge do not challenge their separation.  However, it takes
just one advocate to exploit the weaknesses in the regulations
and then a court, deferring to the &quot;military's&quot; interpretation,
will strike down the statute as unconstitutional.   
<P>
Meanwhile, many soldiers are uncertain about Clinton's policy.
 In October 1994, military sociologist Charles Moskos conducted
an informal survey of soldiers in Haiti.  He found that 39 percent
thought the policy too lenient, 36 percent thought it to be a
good policy, and 22 percent were not sure.[35]  
<P>
<B>7. Attacks current policy requiring military psychiatrists
to report homosexual service members.</B>[36] The military does not
recognize absolute doctor-patient confidentiality.  A military
physician treating someone for a disorder that disqualifies the
member from continued service is bound by the regulation to report
the situation.  This is important for deployment and health readiness
purposes.
<P>
<B>8. Distorts facts about allied military experiences
with homosexuals.</B>  The article states, &quot;a survey of the
policies and practices of NATO armies revealed that only 24 percent
(4 of 17: New Zealand, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United
States) had exclusionary and separation policies.&quot;[37] The authors
ignore the June 1993 GAO report on &quot;Homosexuals in the Military:
 Policies and Practices of Foreign Countries.&quot;[38] This report
certainly could have been obtained and cited, given the number
of allowed revisions.  The GAO reviewed 25 countries and selected
four countries for detailed analysis.  The report states that
11 countries have policies that do not permit homosexuals to serve
in the military, 11 have policies that do.  Three of the latter
11 countries do not have any laws, regulations, or policies that
address this issue.  An unpublished Pentagon study conducted in
December 1992 found that some of those countries that permit homosexuals
to serve do so with strict guidelines. 
<P>
Testimony before the Senate and House Armed Services Committees
(SASC and HASC) in April and May 1993 illustrates the dramatic
differences between foreign militaries and our own.  For example,
the Netherlands started a homosexual military experiment in 1974.
 That nation has 65,000 service members, including 40,000 conscripts
who serve 14 months and who primarily commute from home each day.
 The U.S. has 2.5 million active and reserve service personnel
stationed in the U.S. and around the world at any given time.
 The German armed forces, which are included among those that
do <I>not</I> have an exclusionary policy, will not induct acknowledged
homosexual volunteers because they would &quot;undermine military
order and discipline.&quot;[39] Of the 476,300 members, 43 percent
are conscripts who, if identified as homosexual, may be required
to undergo psychological tests to determine their fitness.  The
German Federal Administrative Court declared in November 1990
that the military is justified in not allowing homosexuals to
serve in leadership and educational positions.
<P>
Foreign social experiences have little relevance for America's
military.  The U.S. is a superpower with urgent missions worldwide.
 America also has a radical homosexual community and a liberal
judicial system, a combination that guarantees a steady stream
of legal activism that is disruptive to military morale.
<P>
<B>9. Falsely claims that most societies approve of homosexuality.</B>
 The article states, &quot;Cultural studies....  In the early
1950s Ford and Beach studied 77 modern primitive societies concerning
attitudes toward homosexuality.  They found 28 condemned in which
it was condemned but 49, nearly two-thirds, in which it was approved
in more or less restricted forms.&quot;[40]
<P>
This observation is misleading.  Most modern societies consider
homosexuality a mental illness.  For example, a 1992 survey by
the APA's Office of International Affairs in conjunction with
the APA Committee of Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Psychiatrists
surveyed 125 psychiatric associations around the world.  It found
that all but three associations consider homosexuality a mental
illness or a sexual deviation.  U.S. psychiatrists are joined
only by Denmark and South Africa in their efforts to redefine
homosexuality and protect the &quot;right&quot; of homosexual
adults to conduct consensual sexual relations in private.[41]
<P>
<B>10. Misrepresents the pathological implications of
homosexuality.</B> The article cites a 1945 study of 183 former
college students known to be homosexual who served in the military
during World War II.  Sixty-four percent of these people &quot;served
with credible records.&quot;  The review also attributes the military's
decision no longer to view homosexuality as a mental illness to
the APA's 1973 decision to remove homosexuality from the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders-II.[42]
<P>
The article states that only 64 percent of homosexuals in their
study had credible service records.  Rather than being an indication
of success, this should be an argument for exclusion.  Better
than 90 percent of the 8.5 million World War II era veterans &quot;served
with credible records.&quot;  
<P>
The implication is that since 64 percent in a single study had
&quot;credible&quot; records, there is no justification for the
exclusion.  This proves nothing.  They were honored for their
&quot;credible&quot; service to their country, not their homosexual
behavior.  After all, the ban was in force, so homosexuals were
forced to curb their behavior. 
<P>
The history of the American Psychiatric Association's decision
to change the DSM-II is worth examining.  Specifically, the military's
World War II experience provided considerable insight into human
behavior.  Specialists in military medicine literally rewrote
the diagnostic codes and nomenclature for psychiatric disorders
which, ultimately, became the format used by the American Psychiatric
Association in the 1980s and 1990s.  In 1952 the APA Council approved
and published a new nomenclature for categorizing mental disorders
similar to those used by the military.  The nomenclature identified
homosexuality as a pathologic behavior, i.e., &quot;sexual deviation,&quot;
under the section on Sociopathic Personality Disturbances.[43]
<P>
The second edition of the DSM for Mental Disorders continued to
identify homosexuality as a &quot;sexual deviation&quot; disorder.
 And since 1945 the Army has consistently held that homosexuality
is a behavioral problem, not a mental disease.[44]
<P>
From 1969 to 1971, homosexual activists stormed the annual meetings
of the APA demanding the normalization of homosexual behavior.
 In 1971 homosexual activists invaded the annual meeting, screaming
and kicking, seizing microphones, and denouncing psychiatry as
&quot;the enemy incarnate.&quot;[45]
<P>
The DSM was challenged at the 1973 meeting of the New England
Psychiatric Society by homosexual activists.  They recommended
that the nomenclature's section on &quot;sexual deviation&quot;
be renamed &quot;sexual dysfunction.&quot;  Later that year APA
Trustees ruled that homosexuality would no longer be listed as
a &quot;mental disorder&quot; in its official nomenclature of
mental disorders and recommended that it be replaced by the term
&quot;sexual orientation disturbance.&quot;[46]
<P>
According to author Ronald Bayer in <I>Homosexuality and American
Psychiatry: The Politics of Diagnosis</I>, homosexual activists
used intimidation to force the APA to remove homosexuality as
a mental illness from the DSM of psychiatric disorders.  &quot;The
result was,&quot; explained Bayer, &quot;not a conclusion based
upon an approximation of the scientific truth as dictated by reason,
but was instead an action demanded by the ideological temper of
the times.&quot;[47]
<P>
Homosexuality was subsequently regarded as a variant of sexual
orientation disturbance.  The &quot;nomenclature revolution&quot;
continued and in 1986 the last remaining term, &quot;ego-dystonic
homosexuality,&quot; was removed from the DSM.  This was done
over the protest of many psychiatrists who preferred to label
it a long standing disturbance originating in the early years
of life.[48]
<P>
The membership of the American Medical Association disagreed with
the APA's decision.  A 1975 AMA membership survey found that 69
percent agreed that homosexuality is &quot;pathological.&quot;[49]
 Additionally, psychotherapists such as Elizabeth Moberly, Gerald
van den Aardweg, Joseph Nicolosi, Charles Socarides, and Masters
and Johnson have reported much success helping homosexuals to
recover, thereby proving the point that it is curable.[50]
<P>
<B>11. Claims military homosexuals would not contribute
to poor morale.</B>  The article proposes three points concerning
military morale.  First, it blames immature recruits for the anti-homosexual
policy but fails to cite supporting data.  &quot;Many recruits,
who may be insecure in their own sexual orientation, may react
with various forms of discomfort to the presence of an identified
homosexual person.&quot;[51] Second, it acknowledges that &quot;subcultures
in a military organization can disrupt functioning of the unit...since
the military copes with many subcultures, it remains for the military
to make a convincing case that this [homosexual] subculture is
substantially and essentially so much more damaging&quot; to justify
&quot;the costs of [the] current policy.&quot;[52] The military's
significant experience with drug and alcohol subcultures provides
ample experience with damaging categories of behavior.  Finally,
the authors state, &quot;We expect that acceptance of homosexuals
in the military will increase, negating the need for a walled-off
subculture and resulting in more respect for the homosexual soldier.&quot;[53]
 The authors provide no reason or basis for this supposition.
<P>
Morale is defined as &quot;a strong sense of enthusiasm and dedication
to a commonly shared goal that unifies a group.&quot;  Heterosexual
soldiers forced to live and work with avowed homosexuals cannot
be expected to do so with &quot;...a strong sense of enthusiasm.&quot;
<P>
Open homosexuals tend to bind their basic identity with their
sexual orientation and practice: &quot;I am a homosexual,&quot;
as opposed to the American soldier's basic identity: &quot;I am
a soldier.&quot;  The homosexual's preoccupation with individual
behavioral characteristics is incongruent with and detracts from
the commonly shared goal -- accomplishment of the mission -- which
unifies heterosexual soldiers and subordinates their individual
goals to that of the group.
<P>
The homosexual subculture is recognized as &quot;liberated&quot;
or, in a manner of speaking, undisciplined.  This is inherently
at odds with the 24-hour discipline system within which soldiers
must live and work.  Homosexuals are distinguished from other
subcultures by their behavior [sodomy].  Another group behavioral
characteristic is a very high rate of promiscuity.  Military records
indicate that homosexuals are statistically more likely to engage
in misconduct than heterosexuals.  They have a higher incidence
of drug and alcohol abuse than heterosexuals.  If these statistics
aren't enough, much-touted books such as Randy Shilts' <I>Conduct
Unbecoming</I> and Mary Ann Humphrey's <I>My Country, My Right
to Serve</I> provide, perhaps unwittingly, ample testimony to
the disruptive nature of homosexuals in military units.
<P>
The voice of experience also indicates that homosexuals jeopardize
military morale.  For example, a survey of active duty officers
conducted for the American Security Council Foundation found that
99.03 percent said homosexuals would undermine the cohesiveness
and readiness of combat units.[54] The Defense Readiness Council
compiled a survey of 2,800 retired flag and general officers.
 Nearly 90 percent said they believe homosexuals undermine morale.[55]
<P>
<B>12. Contends, against the evidence, that homosexuals
aren't a security risk</B>.  The article states that identifying
oneself as a homosexual is no more of a security risk than identifying
oneself as a heterosexual.  The authors call for the government
to show a &quot;nexus&quot; between the presence of homosexuals
and adverse impact on duty performance.[56]
<P>
This is a flawed argument.  Few people identify themselves as
heterosexual; that identity is assumed.  Homosexuals do, indeed,
identify themselves, however.
<P>
The article ignores the landmark research by Alan Bell and Martin
Weinberg, <I>Homosexualities: A Study of Diversity Among Men and
Women</I>, which found that a significant number of homosexuals
report that &quot;someone has threatened [them with] exposure
of homosexuality in order to get something of value.&quot;[57]
<P>
If the threat of blackmail was the only problem with homosexuals
in the military, then lifting the prohibition would be justified.
 However, for the many reasons cited in this analysis, homosexuals
should not serve openly and security investigations are a valid
mechanism for enforcing the ban.
<P>
<B>13. Contends, against overwhelming evidence, that homosexuals
are not a special health risk.</B>  The article virtually ignores
the documented health risks associated with the homosexual lifestyle,
citing only the military's HIV screening program.  &quot;By policy,&quot;
the authors explain, &quot;no one who tests positive for the HIV
virus is allowed to enter active duty.&quot;[58]
<P>
Admitting open homosexuals into the military violates the legal
principle of the assumption of risk.  This principle states that
if you know there is a risk and you assume it, then don't complain
when the risk materializes.  The review's authors denigrate a
very serious risk.
<P>
A recent report from the University of Michigan found that people
with HIV are more capable of spreading the virus during the first
60 days of infection, but that blood tests during this period
do not find the HIV.[59] This means that the military assumes the
risk, even though all personnel are initially tested, that soldiers
will not be infected.  This is why screening out high-risk groups
and not just those who test positive for HIV is smart.  Unfortunately,
the Clinton Administration no longer screens out homosexuals --
the highest-risk group for contracting HIV.
<P>
The Army's Surgeon General, Lieutenant General Alcide Lanoue,
addressed the health risks associated with homosexuals:[60]
<P>
&quot;The military setting provides unique requirements for
safety in executing the Army blood transfusion program and for
preventing the transmission of blood-borne pathogens (especially
HIV and hepatitis B) in the field setting.  Homosexual males would
comprise a pool of ineligible blood donors and as a group are
at high risk of infection by HIV and hepatitis B, both significant
blood-borne pathogens which can infect other soldiers through
exposure to blood in peace and war.&quot; [During Operation Desert
Storm, there were five documented instances where blood was drawn
from soldiers and transfused.  In Somalia, five units of blood
were drawn and directly transfused to Somalis.  The urgency of
such transfusions precludes testing for the AIDS virus.]
<P>
&quot;HIV and other Sexually Transmitted Disease rates will
increase to the extent that the proportion of homosexual males
in the Army increases because homosexual/bisexual men are allowed
to enter and remain in the Army.&quot;  [The CDC reports that
most of the AIDS patients in this country are homosexuals.[61] Homosexuals
account for a disproportionate number of America's most serious
STD's, including syphilis, gonorrhea, genital warts, and hepatitis
A and B.[62] Moreover, the 1994 homosexual sex survey in <I>The Advocate</I>,
a leading homosexual magazine, found that 13 percent of respondents
were HIV-positive and only 18 percent had taken all three shots
in the hepatitis B vaccine series.  <I>The Advocate</I> article
admits &quot;Gay men are one of the top risk groups for being
exposed to hepatitis B.&quot;[63] ]
<P>
&quot;A male homosexual soldier is significantly more likely
than a heterosexual soldier to be nondeployable for medical reasons
related to HIV infection.  If HIV-infected, the soldier will be
permanently nondeployable.  Male homosexuals are more likely to
acquire sexually transmitted diseases which can render them nondeployable,
such as gonorrhea, syphilis, and hepatitis B.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Readiness from a medical standpoint will suffer if the restriction
is lifted.  The impact would be felt at the unit level, when the
homosexual soldier cannot train and deploy for health reasons.
 Likewise, the impact would be felt Army-wide in terms of the
military blood program and of the burden placed on the Army health
care system.&quot;
<P>
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, homosexuals
are especially vulnerable to contracting HIV.  They are a high-risk
group because of co-factors associated with their lifestyle. 
These include recreational drug use, homosexual sex, malnutrition,
prior incidents of sexually transmitted diseases, and, most significantly,
sexual promiscuity.  
<P>
Homosexuals who participate in unsafe sex practices with multiple
partners and without taking precautions are at great risk of contracting
sexually transmitted diseases.  <I>The Advocate</I> survey found
that 72 percent of homosexual respondents engage in insertive
oral intercourse, 46 percent insertive anal intercourse, 45 percent
receptive anal-oral sex, 48 percent in three-way sex, 24 percent
in group sex (4 or more), and 10 percent in sadomasochism.[64] Most
of the homosexuals in the survey admitted to having had more than
30 sex partners over their lifetime, and about a third (35 percent)
report more than 100 partners.  The survey also found that homosexual
men use condoms only 1 time in 4.[65]
<P>
Heterosexuals have fewer sex partners than homosexuals.  A 1988-1990
General Social Survey found that 91 percent of men 25 to 29 years
of age are heterosexually active.  Nineteen percent of these men
have had only one lifetime sex partner, 55 percent have had 2
to 19 lifetime partners, and 25 percent have had 20 or more lifetime
partners.[66]
<P>
The University of Chicago published a national sex survey in October,
1994, which found that 20 percent of men have had only one sex
partner in their lifetime, 21 percent have had 2 to 4 partners,
17 percent had 5 to 10 partners, 16 percent had 11 to 20, and
17 percent report having had 21 or more sex partners.[67] However,
that survey excluded men over 59, who constitute one-sixth of
the population and who typically have more conservative sex lives.
 Thus the real figures probably are even lower for the population
of all men.[68]
<P>
Homosexuality also increases medical costs.  With the ban in place,
openly homosexual inductees are turned away.  However, with the
ban lifted, a homosexual recruit could contract HIV within days
or have early-stage HIV, test negative at first, and be accorded
full medical benefits for the rest of his life.  This is about
$120,000 in direct medical costs per AIDS patient.[69]
<P>
Dr. Edmund Tramont, Associate Director for retroviral research
at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, published a 10-year projection
for HIV costs at $1.7 to $1.9 billion.[70]  However, he warns that
this is in 1989 dollars, is based on the present rate of new cases,
and assumes that only 60 percent of health care beneficiaries
will use the military health care system.  The potential 10-year
cost could rise to $5 billion if these assumptions are incorrect.[71]
 The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services indicates that
the lifetime cost of treating a person with AIDS -- from diagnosis
until death -- is $102,000.[72] The American Medical Association
estimated the per-person AIDS patient cost would rise to $386,000
by the year 2000 and to $639,000 by the year 2008.[73]
<P>
As of April 1993 the military had dealt with 8,832 HIV-positive
service members.  Most have been separated from the service, but,
at that time, 1,580 were still on active duty.  Their status precluded
them from deploying overseas and necessitated special assignments
and special medical care.[74]
<P>
Homosexuals also have a much shorter life expectancy than heterosexuals,
as indicated by a study of more than 6,400 obituaries in 16 homosexual
newspapers.  The average age of homosexuals who died from AIDS
is 39; from all other causes it is 41.[75]
<P>
Substance addiction and abuse are called the second set of key
health problems after AIDS in the homosexual subculture (and violence
is third).[76]
<P>
Screening out homosexuals and discharging those discovered later
makes financial sense.  The 1992 GAO report states that the military
spent $26 million on homosexuals discharged.  The military spent
many times that figure treating homosexuals with AIDS -- people
who lied to enter the military and now receive full health and
pay benefits.  The cost-effective decision would be to minimize
the risk to the federal taxpayer by rejecting homosexuals before
they are recruited and discharging those later discovered.
<P>
<B>14. Cites legal challenges as indication that public
will soon favor homosexual service.</B>  The article briefly reviews
the current judicial climate regarding the military policy.  The
authors believe, &quot;With the increased public attention now
focused on the miliary policy, swift changes could sweep away
previous positions.&quot;[77]
<P>
The article cites two cases won by the government and the case
of Navy Petty Officer Keith Meinhold, who was discharged for saying
he was gay on national television.  Meinhold's case was labeled
&quot;the most recent legal case decided.&quot;[78]
<P>
Meinhold's case is not the most recent case decided.  The case
of former midshipman Joseph C. Steffan from the U.S. Naval Academy
was decided by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
on November 22, 1994.  The decision from the country's &quot;second
highest court&quot; declared the military's homosexual ban constitutional.[79]
<P>
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled August
31, 1994 that a statement of homosexuality alone is insufficient
reason to discharge Meinhold.  That decision was limited only
to sailor Meinhold and struck down the lower court's decision
to extend the ruling to the entire Defense Department.[80]
<P>
Although numerous cases of former service members discharged for
homosexuality are now in the judicial system, there is no indication
that &quot;swift changes&quot; will &quot;sweep away previous
positions.&quot;  On the contrary, it is expected that the 104th
Congress will force the Clinton Administration to enforce the
homosexual law despite rulings that are in conflict with the law.
<P>
The issue of homosexuals in the military was cited as one of the
pivotal issues that collapsed the Democratic Party's majority
in Congress.  The new majority should respond by reinstating the
full homosexual ban, i.e., require the Clinton Administration
to obey the new homosexual law and to reintroduce the questions
for recruits at induction.
<P>
<B>15. Concludes that the ban is based solely on bad attitudes.</B>
 The article states, &quot;The strongest argument for excluding
and separating homosexual persons from military service is 
not mental illness or security risks but the presence of social
strictures and adverse attitudes.&quot;[81]
<P>
The authors ignore a wealth of information that comes from Congress's
oversight hearings in 1993.  Reasons include combat readiness
(cohesion, deployability risk, family and community risks); manpower
(recruitment and retention risks); cost (medical, housing, claims
from soldiers previously discharged for homosexuality, quality
of force sustainment, and lost productivity); and political (military
used as laboratory for social experimentation to satisfy the political
views of a small minority).  The article completely ignores these
concerns.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
&quot;Homosexuality and the Military&quot; is an article that
was rushed to press, was poorly reviewed, and does little for
the academic credibility of the APA -- an organization that should
be promoting sound research, not a moral agenda that abuses and
neglects available research.  The article is evidence that the
APA is playing an ever greater role in the promotion of the homosexual
agenda.

<P>
In the welfare debate last year, President Clinton himself stated
that &quot;the real source of [the] problem is the inordinate
number of out-of-wedlock births in this country.&quot;[1]  He also
conceded that &quot;there's no question that [ending welfare for
unwed mothers] would work.  The question is... 'Is it morally
right?'&quot;[2]
<P>
While the President's proposed policies leave much to be desired,
he has formulated precisely the right question to frame the current
debate over welfare reform in general and illegitimacy in particular.
 There can be no more important policy objective than the preservation
-- or more properly in this day and age, the revitalization --
of our nation's moral capital.  As James Q. Wilson wrote in his
oft-cited article, &quot;The Rediscovery of Character: Private
Virtue and Public Policy&quot;:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The essential first step is to acknowledge that at root, in almost
every area of important public concern, we are seeking to induce
persons to act virtuously....  Not only is such conduct desirable
in its own right, it appears now to be necessary if large improvements
are to be made in those matters we consider problems.[3]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
There exists a striking public consensus that the welfare state's
practice of subsidizing illegitimacy is not only a massive problem,
but a moral problem at root.
<P>
Even so unlikely a source as Bruce Reed, President Clinton's leading
aide on welfare reform, acknowledges that the essential purpose
of reform must be to reverse the alarming rise in out-of-wedlock
births.[4]  If not driven exclusively by AFDC &quot;benefits,&quot;
the increase has at least been sustained and perpetuated by the
expansion of a system that pays recipients to bear illegitimate
children.  Current trends indicate that by the year 2015 -- some
studies project as early as 2000 -- one of every two American
babies will be born to a single mother, and illegitimacy will
surpass divorce as the main cause of fatherlessness.  If a job
program succeeds in putting more unmarried welfare mothers to
work (which is unlikely on a sufficiently grand scale, given budget
constraints), we will still be left with roughly the same number 
of fatherless children.  While
Great Britain has already succeeded in implementing reforms that
make work economically more attractive than welfare, the reforms
of the 1980s have only served to underscore in both Britain and
America the fact that little progress can be made without addressing
the collapse of the family.[5]
<P>
No moral judgment even need be adduced to acknowledge that intact
families bestow upon individuals and communities advantages that
simply come no other way.  Empirical evidence amassed by social
scientists in the last ten years (and chronicled for popular consumption
by Barbara Dafoe Whitehead in her April 1993 <I>Atlantic</I> article,
&quot;Dan Quayle Was Right&quot;) has confirmed in exquisite detail
what those who have lived in broken families already know.  A
single woman with children is not a viable economic unit for the
vast majority, but children need biological fathers for much more
than the extra dollars they add to the family budget.  As social
scientist Charles Murray has written, single parenthood is &quot;damaging
to children in so many ways that to list them individually would
be to trivialize them.&quot;[6]
<P>
Not surprisingly, Dr. Murray also concludes that &quot;illegitimacy
is the single most important social problem of our time...because
it drives everything else.&quot;[7]  More than 70 percent of all
juveniles in state reform institutions, for example, come from
fatherless homes; and the relationship between crime and one-parent
families is so powerful that controlling for family structure
erases the relationship between crime and race and between crime
and low income.  Illegitimacy feeds itself, too.  Young white
women who grow up without a father in the home are more than twice
as likely to bear children out-of-wedlock and to do so during
their teenage years when they are most likely to form long-term
attachments to AFDC.
<P>
If those on the welfare rolls have suffered most conspicuously,
it is also true that the welfare system has corrupted the ideals
and narrowed the vision of many who live well beyond the bounds
of the inner city -- even as it is now threatening our most cherished
civic institutions.  One obvious casualty is the weakening of
our conviction that the so-called &quot;bourgeois virtues&quot;
are available to all, regardless of race or class.  Early American
social workers, like Mary Ellen Richmond, understood the importance
of middle class norm-setting.  &quot;The way to reintegrate the
deviant into society, she argued, is to educate and indeed direct
them toward the shared values of the mainstream culture.&quot;[8]
<P>
The role of the traditional two-parent family is essential in
sustaining the institutions of a free society precisely because
it is the vehicle by which values are transmitted from generation
to generation.  If the family fails to impart virtues that temper
and restrain behavior, broad legal freedoms must give way.  So,
too, human dignity and equality, as the Founders understood them.
 Virtue, historian Gertrude Himmelfarb has said, is the only true
basis of equality and the only requisite for citizenship.[9]  As
Charles Murray made clear in his now famous op-ed &quot;The Coming
White Underclass,&quot; either we act now to reduce illegitimacy
and to reinfuse our public policy with a commitment to higher
and nobler things -- or we run the risk of sabotaging the entire
experiment in democratic self-government.
<P>
Or, as Michael Novak put it:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[T]he project of self-government depends on the capacity of citizens
to govern their own passions, urges, habits, and expectations.
 If they cannot govern their own lives individually, how can they
be successful in self-government as a republic?  The project of
self-government is moral -- or not at all.[10]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The Founding Fathers and many succeeding generations understood
that only a virtuous people can be free.  Do we?
<P>
Given the consequences for the individual child, the surrounding
community, and the national polity, bringing a baby into this
world without a sense of sacred responsibility cannot long be
regarded as a morally neutral act.  In a report issued in December
1994, the Progressive Policy Institute, policy arm of the Democratic
Leadership Council, joined others in acknowledging that &quot;it
is wrong -- not simply foolish or impractical -- for women and
men to make babies they cannot support emotionally and financially.&quot;[11]
 Donna Shalala made the same concession a year earlier, however
reluctantly, when she said in an interview, &quot;I don't like
to put this in moral terms, but I do believe that having children
out-of-wedlock is wrong.&quot;[12]
<P>
Congress should now recognize that it is also wrong to sanction
such activity by subsidizing it.  Republican strategist Bill Kristol
has said that &quot;neither our politics nor our sociology can
ultimately be neutral as to the content of the _laws of Nature
and Nature's God,_&quot;[13] chief among which is the fact that
we were made to live in families.  Charles Murray asks rhetorically:
 if &quot;a social policy that induces people to believe that
they are not responsible for their lives is one that inhibits
the pursuit of happiness and is to that extent immoral[,] [c]an
then a policy that <I>fails</I> to stigmatize be a moral one?&quot;[14]
<P>
Historical experience, related by Marvin Olasky and others, does
indeed demonstrate that the most effective social services have
been offered by private community groups, without any illusion
of moral neutrality.  In her seminal historical study <I>Poverty
and Compassion</I>, Gertrude Himmelfarb writes that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[a]fter making the most arduous attempt to objectify the problem
of poverty, to divorce poverty from any moral assumptions and
conditions, we are learning how inseparable the moral and material
dimensions of that problem are.  And after trying to devise social
policies that are scrupulously neutral and _value-free,_ we are
finding these policies fraught with moral implications that have
grave material and social consequences.[15]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
George Liebmann says, more simply, in a recent issue of <I>The
American Enterprise</I>, &quot;Rescuing an underclass is by definition
a highly moralistic undertaking.&quot;[16]  While controlling welfare
spending is a happy byproduct of terminating benefits to teen
mothers, even more promising is the opportunity to begin reversing
the message of the counterculture that has so eroded the character
of our people, in part by assaulting the family.
<P>
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan has used the phrase &quot;defining
deviancy down&quot; to describe Americans' tendency to ignore
excess levels of deviancy by normalizing what used to be considered
pathology.  Only by &quot;defining deviancy down&quot; have we
been able to ignore until now all the signs of impending disaster
that attend a burgeoning illegitimacy rate.  Barbara Whitehead's
1993 <I>Atlantic</I> article heralded a real and significant change
in the public mood, however; and the near-mythic ascendancy of
Charles Murray's &quot;Coming White Underclass&quot; piece the
same year seemed to confirm a general convergence of public opinion.
 In a recent Family Research Council survey of 1,000 Americans,
a substantial majority (81 percent) of respondents indicated that
&quot;women having babies out of wedlock that they can't support
financially&quot; is a serious problem.  The mounting public consensus
presents a unique opportunity to implement more than symbolic
change in the 104th Congress and to make sanctions against illegitimacy
the focus of that change.
<P>
In sending his welfare package to Congress more than 30 years
ago, President Kennedy articulated contemporary liberals' fundamental
misunderstanding of the causal role welfare plays in boosting
illegitimacy rates.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[W]elfare programs, [he said], must contribute to the attack
on . . . family breakdown [and] illegitimacy. . . .  Unless such
problems are dealt with effectively, they fester, and grow, sapping
the strength of society as a whole and extending their consequences
in troubled families from one generation to the next.[17]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Kennedy's insight about the consequences has proven historically
accurate; but his &quot;service&quot; approach to curbing illegitimacy
worked no better than the current President's will -- a fact which
an unnamed aide on the Clinton welfare task force acknowledged
last year.
<P>
While the President advocates a massive and expensive public relations
campaign against out-of-wedlock births, his aide confided to <I>Newsweek</I>
reporter Joe Klein: &quot;We looked at a hundred different programs
around the country that were trying to deal with this problem,
and not one of them moved the needle.  There just weren't any
results.&quot;[18]  Likewise, a formal study of the Teenage Parent
Demonstration, sponsored by the Department of Health and Human
Services in response to &quot;persistently high rates of teenage
pregnancies and births,&quot; found that &quot;[t]he program had
an unusual and disappointing pattern of impacts on pregnancy and
birth rates . . . despite . . . the substantial efforts of the
programs to empower [the] young mothers to take control of their
fertility.&quot;[19]
<P>
Charles Murray anticipated the problem in his 1988 book <I>In
Pursuit of Happiness and Good Government</I>.  &quot;The task,&quot;
he concludes, &quot;is not to devise a public relations campaign
to discourage single teenage girls from having babies, but to
neutralize whatever is impeding the age-old impulse of human beings
to form families.&quot;[20]  Eliminating grants to unwed teenage
mothers will be necessary, but not sufficient, to restore the
integrity of the family unit.
<P>
Only by historical accident were unwed mothers -- of any age --
ever included in the AFDC program.  Frances Perkins, President
Roosevelt's Secretary of Labor and chief architect of welfare
policy, opposed extending federal entitlements to unmarried mothers
because she foresaw that subsidizing illegitimacy would escalate
family breakdown.  It would be ironic at best if the current majority
in Congress were to find themselves to the left of the most liberal
member of the Roosevelt Administration because they rejected that
intuition, now confirmed by years of sad experience.  It is the
potential to reverse that sad experience that must define &quot;compassion&quot;
in the present debate.  As the one policy option that promises
to effect change in the current system, restrictions on benefits
by definition constitute the compassionate alternative.
<P>
Himmelfarb notes that the word &quot;compassion&quot; once described
&quot;a moral sentiment, not a political principle, a sentiment
evoked by _misery_ or _sorrow,_ not by poverty as such.&quot;[21]
 As political salvationism sought to preempt traditional morals
in the last 30 years, it was only natural that moral sentiments
should be confused with political principles.  Likewise, that
misery and sorrow should be equated with material poverty; for
the redefinition of compassion required a highly artificial view
of man as no more than a material being.
<P>
If compassion is once again properly understood, perhaps then
it will become more obvious that the object of our concern must
be &quot;misery&quot; and &quot;sorrow,&quot; not economic poverty,
and that the &quot;misery&quot; most evident today is the spiritual
and moral deprivation visited upon dependents of the welfare system.
 It is time that we stop suppressing the moral responsibilities
that make life precious for a resident of the inner city just
the same as for a middle-class suburbanite.  It is time, in short,
to secure equal access to the central satisfactions of family,
virtue, and freedom.

<P>
Again, in the course of the welfare debate, the abortion issue
has demonstrated its unique capacity to mobilize and divide.
<P>
Pro-life advocates who resist the so-called family cap, which
would freeze benefits to mothers who bear additional illegitimate
children while on welfare, fear with some justification that the
cap could promote an increase in abortions.  Pro-life advocates
who support the measure share both this concern and the long-term
goal of driving abortions to the point of zero.  Unlike the more
conventional conflict between pro-life and pro-choice groups,
pro-life differences over the family cap represent a dispute over
means, not ends, that is complicated by the absence of any hard
data from actual experimentation.
<P>
Such differences lend themselves to reasoned discussion and, ultimately,
resolution far more easily than the larger debate for and against
abortion rights, which Laurence Tribe has characterized as a &quot;clash
of absolutes.&quot;  While the choice between life and death cannot
be accurately described as a &quot;clash of absolutes,&quot; the
phrase does capture usefully the impossibility of winning adherents
to the pro-life cause without first changing hearts, one at a
time.  In other words, we should forfeit no battles, but neither
can we expect to win the war against abortion on demand without
a comprehensive, long-term strategy to develop and sustain a pro-life
consensus.
<P>
While a pro-life position must be part of the agenda for national
renewal, opposition to abortion must be only one plank of the
pro-life platform.  A crisis as broad and deep as abortion on
demand requires a transformation of the political and moral culture
as well as a reform of law.  Reducing illegitimacy is the <I>sine
qua non</I> of moral reconstruction; and right-to-life activists
should realize that, as one of the few weapons in the anti-illegitimacy
arsenal, the family cap not only serves their cause in the long-term
but deserves their active support in the short-term -- subject
to the critical qualification that there must be no attendant
funding for abortions.
<P>
No hard data are available to demonstrate that the family cap
stimulates the abortion rate.  And there is reason to think that
the family cap will <I>not</I> increase abortions, even in the
short-term.    
<P>
Feminists and welfare rights activists argue that the current
benefits level is already far too low to cover the costs associated
with a new baby.  If so, it is illogical to maintain that a cap
would have a sufficiently significant impact on the &quot;affordability&quot;
of another child to necessitate such a drastic measure as abortion.
<P>
The decision to abort, anyhow, is far more than an economic calculation.
 Twenty years of spiraling illegitimacy rates in the face of liberalized
abortion laws demonstrate that many individuals do not regard
abortion as a viable option.  Policy data collected by the Family
Research Council suggest that abortion is even less acceptable
to poor women;[1] and an article recently published in <I>Family
Planning Perspectives</I> found that abortion rates for teen welfare
mothers are <I>lower</I> than national averages for all teenage
girls.[2]
<P>
Those who are tempted to conclude that it is the availability
of welfare checks that reduces the abortion rate, relative to
the general population, should keep in mind the basis of comparison.
 That hypothesis -- that limited cash benefits suppress the abortion
rate -- would predict a <I>lower</I> rate of abortion in the general
population, relative to welfare mothers, because the average member
of the general population has more economic resources at her disposal.
 The empirical data, however, refute the hypothesis; and Douglas
Besharov of the American Enterprise Institute has commented that,
to the contrary, &quot;[k]ids who have less to lose . . . are
less likely to have an abortion.&quot;[3]       
<P>
The finding that abortion rates for teen welfare mothers are lower
than national averages for all teenage girls is a powerful suggestion
that non-economic factors determine the decision to carry a child
to term.  Other research supports the claim that, whether conception
was intended or not, most illegitimate births to underclass women
today are &quot;wanted.&quot;[4] Certainly, there is ample anecdotal
evidence to suggest that some girls have babies because they want
&quot;something to love&quot; -- or, worse yet, because their
peer group has perversely defined a baby as a status symbol.[5]
<P>
Others, including the young welfare mother who testified before
a recent congressional hearing on illegitimacy, simply believe
that abortion is wrong and choose not to compound their first
mistake by committing another.  While poverty dispirits some lives,
in others it serves to highlight the intangibles that make life
most sacred.  The point of decrying moral deterioration among
the underclass is to assert an easily forgotten truth: every person,
regardless of economic status, is capable of the very moral commitments
that argue most forcefully against abortion.
<P>
Even assuming that our ultimate objective is to save as many lives
as possible, it is by no means clear that the appropriate operational
measure of success in assessing the family cap would be the number
of lives saved in the short-term -- if such a number could be
approximated in the future as it cannot be now.  The question
itself is a red herring because it obscures the larger and more
important issue: &quot;What constitutes progress toward ending
altogether the culture that finds abortion acceptable?&quot;
<P>
Deciding on a rational means to maximize the total number of lives
saved in fact requires two sets of measures for maximizing that
good -- human lives saved in the short-term and human lives saved
over the course of several generations.  Since the policy changes
under consideration affect illegitimacy and the structure of the
welfare system, the number of lives saved in the long-run should
include both children who would have been aborted as well as the
children who would have fallen prey to the violent crime that
results from, as James Q. Wilson put it, &quot;neglecting the
processes by which the underclass reproduces itself.&quot;[6]
<P>
While there is no point at which the short-term perspective loses
relevance, few would dispute that there exists some point at which
the long-term implications demand consideration.  If it is true
that preserving the current benefits package will save lives,
presumably we could save even more lives by increasing the entitlements
tenfold.  Yet, most right-to-life activists intuitively understand
that there is an alternative good to be served by restricting
benefits that will in no way compromise our commitment to life.
<P>
Charles Murray wrote in his 1988 book <I>In Pursuit of Happiness
and Good Government</I>, in a passage that defined the parameters
and the language of the above analysis: &quot;It cannot be . .
. that the objective of a program is to save lives.  It may be
the <I>operational</I> measure of success, but it cannot be the
<I>construct</I> . . . because it has no discriminatory power.
. . .  One can too easily think of measures that will save lives
efficiently but are also totalitarian.&quot;[7]
<P>
The construct we are really interested in is &quot;advancing the
pro-life cause,&quot; which we may attempt to operationalize by
estimating the total number of lives saved now and later as a
result of the proposed policy change -- in this case, the family
cap.  And there is no question that reducing illegitimacy by imposing
restrictions on welfare benefits will serve the over-arching purpose
of the pro-life movement.
<P>
As Chuck Donovan explained in a paper published by the Family
Research Council, it is a basic statistical fact that marital
status and the abortion rate are inextricably linked.  The vast
majority of abortions are performed on unmarried women -- and
the proportion is growing.  To reduce abortions, therefore, we
should reduce the premarital sex and out-of-wedlock pregnancy
that create a perceived &quot;need&quot; for abortion.
<P>
Right-to-life activists who oppose measures to reduce illegitimacy
are helping to sustain the very system that encourages young women
to find themselves in the predicament that makes abortion seem
as attractive as it possibly could.  Opposition to the family
cap is a curiously negative way to affirm life.  Although it should
be noted that many pro-life advocates are the ones on the front
lines offering material assistance to unwed mothers who do decide
to keep their babies, it would be far more compassionate to try
to preclude the need for that help in the first place.
<P>
Glenn Loury and James Q. Wilson argued convincingly at recent
welfare hearings before the Human Resources subcommittee that
the problems of illegitimacy and abortion are moral -- not material
-- problems.  They require spiritual solutions which no government
can provide directly.  Yet, Loury writes, &quot;in every community
there are agencies of moral and cultural development that seek
to shape the ways in which individuals conceive of their duties
to themselves, of their obligations to each other, and of their
responsibilities before God.&quot;[8]
<P>
In many communities, right-to-life organizations are those very
agencies, and they deserve credit and gratitude they don't often
receive.  By gradually eliminating federal benefits, poor women
who are pregnant out of wedlock will be forced to turn to local
organizations, including right-to-life crisis pregnancy groups,
that will counsel against abortion and discourage further irresponsible
behavior.
<P>
Launching the arguments against illegitimacy in the context of
the current debate over those benefits will give new rhetorical
emphasis and more widespread attention to the arguments against
abortion; for, the two ills spring from the same misconception
that life is cheap and motherhood bears no sacred responsibility.
 Indeed, the bipartisan focus on illegitimacy is one of the most
golden opportunities we have had in quite some time to reverse
the message of the counterculture that has made abortion &quot;rights&quot;
seem palatable.
<P>
Yet, to increase the logic and appeal of pro-life arguments to
a significant number of people who do not now see the moral force
in such arguments, we must begin the task of rebuilding other
civic institutions that will nourish human souls and liberate
them to fulfill their full potential.  Such an ambitious project
will require a multifaceted strategy, and eliminating the welfare
benefits that encourage illegitimacy will be a key component of
that strategy.
<P>
The interconnections linking functioning communities with functioning
families are so rife and so apparent that even Democrats now concede
Dan Quayle was right.  Illegitimacy, by definition, is the failure
of families to form in the first place; and by driving a host
of social problems that corrode communities and erode the national
character, illegitimacy promotes the failing of family on a grand
scale.
<P>
Charles Murray writes that affiliation -- including family affiliation
-- is a means whereby people of common values are enabled to enact
those values.  A functioning community that promotes a wide array
of affiliations provides an extremely important venue both for
practicing virtue and for passing down to the next generation
the habit of virtue.[9] The pro-life movement is itself a classic
example of people expressing their interests and values through
affiliations that are sustained by a rich network of institutions
outside of -- and sometimes even in opposition to -- government.
<P>
Arguably, members of the underclass do not now have the same type
of privilege; but they should and could if we begin, in Michael
Joyce's words, &quot;the resuscitation of the civic sphere which
alone makes genuine citizenship possible.&quot;[10] Because civil
institutions are the very institutions that cultivate character,
that &quot;appeal to and sustain spirit and heart as much as mind,&quot;[11]
reconstructing them will engender a far more lasting commitment
to pro-life principles than obstruction of the family cap.  Michael
Joyce has explained eloquently: &quot;Through . . . countless,
subtle, daily interactions, our civil institutions give form and
substance to the everyday qualities and values without which life
itself would be impossible.&quot;[12]
<P>
Paradoxical as it may seem, reforming the culture will be the
most expedient complementary strategy for winning new and permanent
legal victories against abortion.  If any issue position depends
on one's idea of man, it is abortion.  And an individual's idea
of man is not something that gives way to clever arguments in
court or the Congress.  Instead, it is shaped and formed from
childhood by the quiet but pervasive messages of the surrounding
society in which children grow and develop into adults.
<P>
In addition to changing notions of the individual, we must also
change the related conception of government.  If we succeed in
restoring a commitment to limited government, the courts will
be under increasing pressure to reverse the abortion decisions
that have, in George Weigel and Bill Kristol's analysis, &quot;[reduced]
the actors in American society to the coercive state and the radically
autonomous individual, bereft of all social ties and responsibilities.&quot;[13]
 There is no better way to undermine this &quot;America of strangers,&quot;
to use Richard John Neuhaus' phrase, than to restore the civil
institutions that nurture the daily interactions and affiliations
that are anathema to the proponents of centralized government.
<P>
Right-to-life advocates give collective voice to a magnificent
idealism in our political discourse.  To them, it does not matter
that a decrease in abortions will mean a disproportionate increase
in minority babies born to low-income parents.  It does matter
that abortions end innocent lives because life is eminently sacred
and precious.
<P>
Thus, pro-lifers should understand more fully than anyone in the
debate over the family cap that abortion is not an issue that
can be nickel-and-dimed or reduced to a scientific calculation
of anticipated marginal changes in the abortion rate.  The very
attempt threatens, however unintentionally, to promote the same
thoroughly dehumanized and despiritualized view of life in which
pro-abortion forces indulge.
<P>
If our objective is to find a rational means to maximize the number
of lives saved over time, it bears repeating that, for Aristotle,
&quot;conformity with a rational principle&quot; meant something
far more humane than a cold mathematical calculation of odds.
 He distinguished between &quot;theoretical wisdom,&quot; which
is more akin to a scientific process, and &quot;practical wisdom,&quot;
defined as &quot;the capacity of deliberating well about what
is good and advantageous.&quot;  Aristotle knew that in making
decisions the best of statesmen would draw upon this more indefinable
wisdom that is an equal but different part of rationality.  So
should we draw upon the best part of our wisdom in evaluating
the costs and benefits of the proposed family cap.[14]
<P>
We should also bear in mind that what we think about the right
to life has an organic relationship with our vision of the kind
of society we should institute.  In the end, it really is not
possible to think about one in isolation from the other; or else
the arguments lose impetus, grow artificial and -- lifeless.
<P>
Not by coincidence, the Declaration speaks of &quot;life&quot;
in the same breath with &quot;liberty&quot; and &quot;the pursuit
of happiness,&quot; two conditions that speak directly to the
question of how best to organize society.  The Founders instituted
a limited government to secure natural rights, including the right
to life; but as George Will noted in a recent editorial, &quot;Our
creed of limited government . . . [has a] corollary vision of
human capacities and of the life worth living,&quot; captured
by the phrase &quot;pursuit of happiness.&quot;[15]
<P>
The Founders would have scoffed at the notion that the protection
of life and limb alone is an adequate notion of &quot;happiness,&quot;
and right-to-life activists forget that at their peril in the
present debate over the family cap.  By opposing the current system
of welfare benefits, we advocate a transformation of the political
and social culture that will sustain both &quot;happiness&quot;
and a more enduring pro-life consensus than even legal reform
can hope to accomplish.

Drug abuse among teenagers has risen significantly in recent years.
 A nationwide survey by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)
in 1994 found that annual marijuana use among 8th graders rose
from 6.2 percent in 1991 to 13 percent in 1994.  The trend is
also evident among 10th (16.5 percent to 30.4 percent) and 12th
(36.7 percent to 38.2 percent) graders.  And cocaine, crack, heroin,
and LSD use among teenagers is also rising and may soon rival
the high rates of the 1970s.[1]
<P>
The NIDA found that drug-related emergency room cases increased
eight percent from 1992 to 1993.[2] Cocaine-related hospital emergency
room visits grew from 101,200 in 1991 to 119,800 in 1992; during
the same period, heroin-related emergencies soared from 35,900
to 48,000.[3]
<P>
In one study of reckless drivers who were not obviously drunk
from alcohol, 59 percent tested positive for cocaine or marijuana[4]
and thirty-five percent of all automobile accident victims in
another study had detectable levels of marijuana in their blood.[5]
<P>
The biggest rise is in marijuana abuse, possibly because it is
perceived differently from the &quot;hard&quot; drugs.  Although
some young people don't even consider marijuana a &quot;drug,&quot;
Dr. Carlton Turner, former NIDA director and head of the Marijuana
Research Project at the University of Mississippi, warns, &quot;There
is no other drug used or abused by man that has the staying power
and broad cellular actions on the body that cannabis [marijuana]
does.&quot;[6]
<P>
The short-term effects of marijuana include impairment in learning
and memory, perception, judgment and complex motor skills.  It
can cause difficulty in speaking, listening effectively, thinking,
retaining knowledge, problem-solving, and forming concepts.[7]
<P>
These effects can translate into poor job performance.  An article
in the <I>Journal of the American Medical Association</I> found
that marijuana users had &quot;55 percent more industrial accidents,
85 percent more injuries and a 78 percent increase in absenteeism.&quot;[8]
<P>
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala states, &quot;Young
people 
must understand that there is clear scientific evidence that marijuana
is a dangerous drug that can have acute and hazardous effects.&quot;[9]
 Over 10,500 published scientific papers show that marijuana damages
brain cells, the lungs, may adversely affect reproduction in women
and fertility in men, endangers the unborn baby and newborns of
pot-smoking women, and could damage the heart.[10] 
<P>
Shalala calls for &quot;strong and comprehensive solutions....Young
people must grow up knowing unambiguously that drug use -- including
smoking marijuana -- is unwise, unhealthful, illegal and wrong.
 They must hear this from everyone in their communities -- their
parents, their teachers, their employers, their peers, the media
-- all of us.  We need anti-drug messages that are every bit as
pervasive and strong as the pop culture images that tell our youth
drugs are o.k.&quot;[11]
<P>
Dr. Lloyd Johnson, lead researcher for NIDA's 20th annual survey,
says the aggressive anti-drug messages of the 1980s have receded
into the background.  &quot;If the softening of attitudes...continues
unabated, we can expect to see continued increases in drug use
among our children.&quot;[12] 
<P>
Dr. Johnson blames the culture.  &quot;The arduously woven fabric
of attitudes, beliefs and peer norms which brought about that
decline (in the 1980s) is beginning to unravel....  Conversely,
we're seeing drug abuse, and specifically marijuana use, talked
about positively in rock and rap music, in television programming
and in other areas like fashion.&quot;[13]
<P>
The consequences of unabated illicit drug use go beyond those
already outlined.  For example, illicit drug use correlates with
crime.  The Bureau of Justice Statistics found that 32 percent
of inmates have used cocaine and half had used drugs in the month
before their offense.  Seventy-five percent reported having used
marijuana in the past.[14]
<P>
Drugs numb the conscience and lower inhibitions.  They contribute
to mood disorders and depression and low self esteem.  A high
proportion of cocaine users admit the drug makes them feel violent
at times.
<P>
Consider some recent examples of youth violence that involved
drug abuse.
<P>
<LI>Five Dodge City, Kansas teenagers, high on marijuana,
killed a stranger for no obvious reason.[15]
<P>
<LI>Three West Palm Beach, Florida teenagers mixed beer,
rum, marijuana and cocaine and then kidnapped and set ablaze a
tourist from Brooklyn.[16]
<P>
<LI>A New Scandia Township, Minnesota teen shot his mother
and stepfather to death.  He admitted to almost daily abuse of
marijuana.[17]
<P>
<LI>Two Miami, Florida teenagers were smoking marijuana
when one accidentally shot and killed the other.[18]
<P>
Social scientists confirm the relationship between drug use and
juvenile deliquency.  A 1990 study published in the <I>Journal
of Drug Issues</I> found the strongest association between the
severity of the crime and the type of substance used -- the more
intoxicating the substance, the more serious the incident.[19]
<P>
A study in <I>Today's Delinquent</I> found alcohol and marijuana
users commit twice the number of delinquent acts as non-users,
and a study in <I>Adolescence</I> found that half of all polydrug
users had engaged in delinquent acts.[20]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>THE CULTURE'S PRO-DRUG INFLUENCE</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Evidence of &quot;drug glorification&quot; in the culture is pervasive.[21]
<P>
Maureen Ketchum, executive director of the Youth Leadership Institute
in San Francisco, states, &quot;Some young people see that to
be hip, sexy, cool they have to drink, party and take drugs....Pop
culture is a factor and young people emulate what is put out there
to emulate.  The industry creates the norm and people live up
to it.&quot;[22]
<P>
Phil Salzman, director of the Gloucester [Massachusetts] Prevention
Network, which works with teenagers in school, writes, &quot;The
power of being accepted and wanting to be normal is a lot stronger
than the truth in the antidrug message....If there is a party
with beer, pot and 60 kids, the norm is determined by the majority
behavior.&quot;[23]
<P>
&quot;Woodstock '94&quot; shows that the sex-drug-rock counterculture
of the 1960s is not dead.  It was temporarily stalled in the 1980s
when the Reagan administration, activists and citizen groups mobilized
against it.  But youth drug use has not disappeared.  And glamorization
of drug use in the industry appears to be on the rise.  Consider
the evidence.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>DRUGS ARE A MAINSTAY IN ROCK AND RAP MUSIC</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML)
has counted 45 music groups that have declared their support for
legalizing marijuana.[24] Here is a profile of some of the pro-drug
groups.  
<P>
<LI>The Black Crowes often unfurl a 48 x 24 foot curtain
bearing a marijuana leaf and the words &quot;Free Us&quot; at
their shows and sell rolling paper for marijuana cigarettes on
the side.[25] They wear trousers covered with images of cannabis
leaves.  Lead singer Chris Robinson told rock magazine <I>High
Times</I>, &quot;We did 350 shows, smoked every night and never
got busted.&quot;  He explains, &quot;Pot's got nothing to be
taboo about, man.  It's part of pop culture.&quot;[26] 
<P>
<LI>Cypress Hill, a rap group, cites the history of marijuana
on the inside cover of its compact disc, &quot;Black Sunday.&quot;
 That disc includes the songs &quot;Legalize It,&quot; &quot;I
Wanna Get High,&quot; &quot;Stoned Is the Way of the Walk,&quot;
and &quot;Light Another.&quot;  Group member Sen Dog states, &quot;We
made it popular to be into the blunt,&quot; which refers to the
trendy practice of smoking a hollowed-out Philly Blunt cigar packed
with marijuana.  Their 1993 album has sold more than a million
copies and included the hit single, &quot;Insane in the Membrane.&quot;[27]
<P>
<LI>Tom Petty's double platinum album &quot;Wildflowers&quot;
includes &quot;You Don't Know How It Feels,&quot; which has the
line, &quot;But let's get to the point, let's roll another joint.&quot;
 Another song on the same album, &quot;It's Good to Be King,&quot;
includes the line, &quot;It's good to get high and never come
down.&quot;  And Petty's non-album track titled, &quot;Girl on
LSD,&quot; has the following lyrics, &quot;Through ecstasy, crystal
methane glue, I've found no drug compares to you.... I was in
love with a girl on LSD.&quot;
<P>
<LI>Green Day's album, &quot;Dookie,&quot; which has sold
more than five million copies, includes songs like &quot;Basket
Case,&quot; with the lyrics, &quot;I think I'm cracking up.  Am
I just paranoid?  I'm just stoned.&quot;  Green Day bassist Mike
Dirnt told <I>Rolling Stone</I>, &quot;I think drinking and doing
drugs are very important.... [He comments on a recent concert.]
 I was flying on acid so hard, I was laying up against the wall
with my bass lying on my lap.&quot;  Tre Cool, Green Day's drummer,
said, &quot;When people bring weed to our shows, that's wonderful.
 I'm the guinea pig.  If somebody throws a bag of weed onstage,
Billie will watch to make sure we don't get all [expletive deleted]
on it, but I dive right in.&quot;  Billie Joe Armstrong concludes,
&quot;...Tre really likes pot -- but the main thing of choice
was speed.  People think that we're this big pot-smoking band
even though we sound like an amphetamine band, but I dabbled a
lot in speed for a long time.  That was the drug of choice on
the scene I came from.&quot;  The band, originally named Sweet
Children, renamed itself in 1989 &quot;after one of its songs
about hanging out and smoking pot.&quot; [28]
<P>
<LI>Nine Inch Nails' album, &quot;The Downward Spiral,&quot;
includes &quot;My Self Destruct&quot; with the lyrics, &quot;I
am the needle in your vein and I control you, I am the high you
can't sustain and I control you.&quot;  &quot;Hurt&quot; has the
following lyric, &quot;The needle tears a hole, the old familiar
sting, try to kill it all away.&quot;  &quot;Hurt&quot; explores
drugs as a means of escape.  Lead singer, Trent Reznor, was voted
<I>Spin</I> magazine's &quot;Best Artist&quot; for 1995, and Nine
Inch Nails was voted the &quot;Best Metal Band&quot; in 1995 by
<I>Rolling Stone</I> readers.  
<P>
<LI>Time Warner distributes an album by rapper Dr. Dre
titled, &quot;The Chronic,&quot; a slang term for a potent strain
of marijuana.  The cover features marijuana leaves.  The album
peaked at number two on the Billboard charts, stayed in the top
10 for eight months, and has sold more than three million copies.
<P>
<LI>The Beastie Boys' latest album, &quot;Ill Communications,&quot;
includes a pro-pot song, &quot;Legalize the weed, and I'll say,
'Thank heavens.'&quot;  The Beastie Boys were declared &quot;Best
Rappers&quot; by <I>Spin</I> and <I>Rolling Stone</I> magazines
for 1995.
<P>
<LI>Snoop Doggy Dogg's album &quot;Doggystyle,&quot; includes
a rap, &quot;Bathtub,&quot; which states, &quot;You can smoke
a pound of bud [marijuana] every day...That's the American dream&quot;
and another, &quot;Gin and Juice,&quot; which states, &quot;Rolling
down the street smoking indo [Indonesian marijuana], sippin' on
gin and juice,&quot; and a third, &quot;Tha Shiznit,&quot; which
states, &quot;I gotta fat bud, sack full of chronic in my back
pocket...Need myself a lighter so I can take a smoke.  I smoke
every day.&quot;  Snoop Doggy Dogg was arrested on December 21,
1994 in Lake Charles, LA, for possession of marijuana and drug
paraphernalia.  He was named by <I>Rolling Stone</I> as &quot;Best
Rap Group&quot; for 1995.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>DRUG MUSIC'S IMPACT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Parent's Music Resource Center reports that teens listen to
an estimated 10,500 hours of rock music between the seventh and
12th grades alone -- just 500 hours less than the total time they
spend in school over 12 years.  Typical estimates are that the
standard teen listens to rock music four to six hours each day.[29]
<P>
Dr. Joseph Stuessey, professor of music history at the University
of Texas, told the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee that, &quot;Music
affects behavior.  This simple fact has been known intuitively
for centuries.... In the 20th century, especially in the last
four decades, tons of research has been done on the interrelationship
of music and human behavior.... It affects our moods, our attitudes,
our emotions, and our behavior.  It affects us psychologically
and physiologically.&quot;[30]
<P>
Child and adolescent psychiatrist Dr. Robert Demski identifies
music as one of the most powerful influences on youth.[31]
<P>
Dr. Sheila Davis, a professor of lyric writing at New York University,
states that songs &quot;are more than mere mirrors of society;
they are a potent force in the shaping of it....[P]opular songs...provide
the primary `equipment for living' for America's youth.&quot;[32]
<P>
Child psychologist Dr. David Elkind writes in <I>The Hurried Child,</I>
&quot;Music can influence young people as much as any visual media.&quot;[33]
<P>
Pharmacologist Dr. Avram Goldstein of Stanford University writes
in <I>Physiological Psychology</I> that for 96 percent of the
respondents in his study, their biggest thrills came from music.[34]
<P>
Dr. Paul King, medical director of the adolescent program at Charter
Lakeside Hospital in Memphis, warns that &quot;80 percent of the
teenagers he treats have listened to heavy metal rock several
hours a day.&quot;[35]
<P>
<H3><CENTER>MTV'S TREATMENT OF ILLICIT DRUG USE</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Dennis Cooper writes in the March 1995 edition of <I>Spin</I>,
a rock music magazine, that pro-drug visual images are especially
provoking.  He explains, &quot;Just the mention of the word
'heroin' in a lyric, or a photograph of a hypodermic
on a CD cover, or the sight of junkie musicians all wrapped up
in some glamorous video, and they [recovering addicts] go crazy
with longing for the stuff.&quot;[36]
<P>
Researchers have found that the marriage between television and
music is powerful.&quot;  The video clarifies the meaning of a
song.[37] MTV's meteoric rise in popularity evidences the power.
 According to the authors of <I>Dancing in the Dark</I>, an eleven-month
study of the growing, changing, and powerful influence of music
and media on youth, music television is &quot;one of the most
powerful forms of contemporary propaganda.&quot;[38]
<P>
MTV founder Robert Pittman explains music television's impact
on youth:  &quot;We're dealing with a culture of TV babies.  They
can watch, do their homework, and listen to music all at the same
time.... At MTV we don't shoot for the fourteen year olds, we
own them.&quot;[39]
<P>
Author Donna Gaines explains, &quot;With MTV, drug use has just
taken on the status of a commodity.&quot;[40] Video director Samuel
Bayer disagrees.  He gives MTV more credit: &quot;I grew up in
the '70s, when there were drug references all over the place....
Kids are smart enough to read between the lines.  Something like
Kurt Cobain dying -- that's what happens when your life is [expletive
deleted].  If anything, videos have the opposite effect.&quot;[41]
<P>
MTV has a drug policy.  Carole Robinson, a senior vice president
at MTV, says that her network does not &quot;promote, glamorize,
or show as socially acceptable the use of illegal drugs or the
abuse of legal drugs.&quot;[42] But Cooper points out, &quot;You
don't need a degree in deconstruction to see the signs of drugginess
all over MTV, whether it's Alice in Chains' elegant little travelogues
of junkie life, or Ministry's 'Just One Fix' clip, in which heroin
withdrawal is given a snazzy, action-packed movie-trailer look,
or even Tori Amos's clip for 'God,' in which a character simulates
'tying off.'  If kids are smart enough to know what's fiction
and what's not, then they are smart enough to decode these kinds
of messages too.&quot;[43]
<P>
Cooper compares MTV's drug policy to a makeup artist's covering
of crow's-feet on an aging actress.  &quot;Pot leaves, pills,
and hypodermic needles are successfully smudged beyond recognition,
but the subtleties remain.&quot;[44]
<P>
MTV and Black Entertainment Television (BET) digitally blur images
of marijuana leaves and names in music videos, such as Dr. Dre's
&quot;Nothing but a G Thang&quot; which features men wearing baseball
caps emblazoned with marijuana leaves.[45] A former member of several
prominent alternative rock bands told Cooper, &quot;I can't even
watch MTV anymore, it's so full of junkies.  I can spot them in
an instant, and I feel like they're calling to me from this terrible
and fascinating place in my past.&quot;[46]
<P>
MTV aired a pro-drug program, &quot;Straight Dope&quot; on August
27, 1994.  Host Kurt Loder introduces the program stating, &quot;We
are going to spend the next hour taking a very close look at drugs,
what they are, what they do to people who use them, and how well
or poorly official government prohibition, the eight-year long
war on drugs, has worked.&quot;
<P>
A teen on the program says, &quot;It's not like I'm trying to
commit suicide or anything -- it's no worse than drinking coffee,
smoking a cigarette, drinking a beer, or taking a shot of tequila.&quot;
<P>
Loder portrays some drug users as rational, everyday people who
are minimally affected by the illicit substances.  The three-part
film was publicized for public school use by &quot;MTV Community
of the Future&quot; and is endorsed by the National Education
Association.  MTV offers &quot;teacher support material&quot;
to help with classroom discussions.[47]

<P>
The May 5, 1994 edition of <I>Rolling Stone</I> is headlined,
&quot;Drugs in America:  The Phony War, the Real Crisis.&quot;
 The magazine is devoted to a pro-drug message.
<P>
The March 1995 edition of <I>Details</I>, a pop culture magazine,
includes an article about the Sativa Hemp Store in San Marcos,
Texas, which stamps dollar bills with the words &quot;I grew hemp&quot;
coming out of George Washington's mouth.  The first president
grew rope hemp at his Northern Virginia estate, Mount Vernon.
 &quot;Hemp activists say the stamp helps to draw attention to
the utility -- and former respectability -- of the plant.&quot;[48]
<P>
Drug advertisements are in many metal, rap and hip hop magazines.
 The college edition of <I>Rolling Stone</I> recently included
an invitation to join NORML which states, &quot;Every 2 minutes,
another American is arrested on marijuana charges.  You could
be next!&quot;[49] Another ad solicits for a bumpersticker, &quot;There's
no hope -- let's do dope.&quot;  <I>Rolling Stone's</I> December,
1994 Double Issue (December 29, 1994 to January 12, 1995) advertises
a &quot;Genuine Ostrich Egg&quot; with a marijuana leaf and the

The same edition of <I>Relix</I> includes a very sympathetic article
entitled &quot;Families Against Mandatory Minimums.&quot;[53] FAMM
president Julie Stewart's brother is serving a five-year term
for cultivation of marijuana.  She accuses the Drug Enforcement
Agency of preying on naive Grateful Dead fans.  &quot;They are
not serious professional drug dealers and so they don't expect
the person who they're selling drugs to, to be an undercover agent.&quot;[54]
 Stewart makes her case by stating, &quot;[T]he drug offenders
are actually pushing violent offenders out of prison because the
violent offenders do not have a mandatory minimum time that they
have to serve.&quot;[55]
<P>
<I>Relix</I> includes a section inviting readers to write to &quot;Incarcerated
Deadheads.&quot;[56] Although the section does not list their convictions,
a personal ad reads, &quot;Help!  In April of 1986 I was arrested
at Irvine Meadows for possession.&quot;[57]
<P>
&quot;Friday at Four&quot; is an America Online interactive computer
talk show with special guests.  It recently hosted Yale law professor
Steven Duke, who taught President Clinton and is the pro-drug
author of <I>America's Longest War: Rethinking Our Tragic Crusade
Against Drugs</I>.  
<P>
Duke responded to questions about drugs.  He said that banned
drugs should be legalized &quot;Absolutely, without a doubt, immediately!&quot;
 He favors lifting the ban on &quot;marijuana, opiates (heroin
and morphine) and cocaine, including crack.&quot;  He also promoted
needle exchanges.  He explained, &quot;I think drug prohibition
causes half of our serious crime....Our biggest problem, worst
drug problem is the tobacco problem.  Legalizing drugs will reduce
the use of alcohol, which is far more damaging than any popular
illegal drug.&quot;[58]
<P>
Even the popular &quot;Dear Abby&quot; syndicated advice column
has gone pro-drug.  Abigail Van Buren recently wrote in favor
of legalization.  She wrote, &quot;The legalization of drugs would
put drug dealers out of business.&quot;[59]
<P>
<H3><CENTER>CALLING ALL PARENTS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Government leaders and scientists recognize that curbing drug
abuse requires positive prevention programs, messages to counter
the pro-drug cultural bent, strong enforcement, and involved parents.
<P>
Joseph Podgorski, a principal of Amherst Central High School near
Buffalo, New York, faults parental naivete for teen drug abuse.
 &quot;There is certainly a lot of drinking going on, especially
on the weekends, and I'm sure there is casual drug use...The biggest
problem is trying to get kids' parents to admit that their kids
have a problem.  A lot of it is just not wanting to deal with
it.&quot;[60]
<P>
Numerous studies show that parents can make the difference for
children faced with peer and cultural pressures to take illicit
drugs.  For example, a study in the <I>Journal of Children in
Contemporary Society</I> found that childhood predictors of adolescent
substance abuse include: family history of drug abuse, family
management and discipline styles, family communication patterns,
and the child's own early use of the gateway drugs.[61]
<P>
A 1985 NIDA study of the use of illegal drugs among children states
that &quot;traditionality, family intactness, self-awareness,
monitoring, and firmness&quot; are parental traits found in the
families of drug-free children.[62]
<P>
A 1990 study in the <I>Journal of Youth and Adolescents</I> considered
peer versus parental influence for substance use.  It found that
parents are the most influential people in the teenager's life,
both for drug users (63.2 percent) and abstainers (79.1 percent).
 Abstaining teens still go to their parents first (66 percent)
when problems arise.  However, drug-using teens tend to go to
friends more often with their problems.[63]
<P>
There are conflicting studies which found that friends and peers
have replaced parents as the greatest influencers of teen values.
 And for the 1990s quite possibly the media will emerge as dominant.
 <I>Dancing in the Dark</I> warns, &quot;Youth...need the media
for guidance and nurture in a society where other social institutions,
such as the family and the school, do not shape the youth culture
as powerfully as they once did.&quot;[64]
<P>
<H3><CENTER>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Superior Court Judge Lois Haight chaired a 1988 White House Conference
on a Drug-Free America.  She heard from 1,000 recovering addicts
who unanimously gave the same heartfelt message, &quot;Make it
difficult, very difficult to use [illicit drugs], because if you
don't, the lure and seductiveness of the 'high' will prevail.&quot;[65]
<P>
Youth attitudes and behaviors have changed with regard to the
threat associated with illicit drugs.  Although the culture has
increasingly embraced pro-drug messages, concerned citizens can
effectively counter these negative influences by educating themselves
to the threat and exercising their responsibility to listen and
lovingly guide children to &quot;Just Say No&quot; to drugs.

THROWING FIRST COURT<BR>

<I>by</I>
<P>
<I>Lt. Col. Robert L. Maginnis (U.S.A., Ret.)</I></CENTER>
<P>
The Justice Department appears to be throwing a key military homosexual
case by not calling expert witnesses to rebut the half-truths
presented by pro-homosexual witnesses like former Assistant Secretary
of Defense Lawrence J. Korb.
<P>
Six avowed homosexuals are contesting the military's homosexual
law in a Brooklyn federal district court case, <I>Abel et al.
v. William Perry</I>.  This is the first federal case challenging
the military's new law.  Plaintiffs allege that the military ban
violates equal protection and free speech rights and imposes punitive
rules unrelated to fitness and ability to serve.[1]
<P>
Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund and the American Civil
Liberties Union are representing the homosexual servicemembers.
 They called six &quot;expert&quot; witnesses to refute the military's
constitutional right to exclude homosexuals.  Not one of those
witnesses was countered by expert defenders of the ban.[2]
<P>
The law is on solid constitutional ground.  Congress has the constitutional
responsibility for writing personnel laws for the military: Article
I, Section 8.  Congress conducted extensive hearings in both the
Senate and the House in 1993.  It then codified the military's
policy banning homosexuals, and President Clinton signed it into
law on November 30, 1993.  The law took effect on February 28,
1994.
<P>
Mr. Korb, who testified on March 16, is an apologist for homosexual
causes who now works for the Brookings Institute.  In the past,
he frequently has relied on a discredited study from the Defense
Personnel Security Research and Education Center (PERSEREC), which
contains much sloppy research and misinformation.
<P>
Some of Korb's statements on the topic deserve closer examination:
<P>
<LI><I>Army Times</I>, February 17, 1992.  Korb states: &quot; [PERSEREC]
 completed two 
studies that concluded: <I>Homosexuals are better prospective
military members than heterosexuals</I>; the Pentagon should engage
in empirical research to see if they can function appropriately
in military units; and the Pentagon should make judgments about
individuals based on conduct, not sexual orientation.&quot;
There is no evidence that &quot;homosexuals are better&quot; soldiers,
and the Pentagon's 1993 studies found conclusively that homosexuals
are a high-risk category of potential recruits. 
<P>
<LI><I>CNN</I>, &quot;Larry King Live,&quot; July 27, 1993.  Korb
said, &quot;[A]ccording to the Pentagon's own studies done out
in Monterey, <I>approximately 200,000 people in the military are
homosexuals.  So you're talking about 10 percent of the force</I>.&quot;
<P>
The cited &quot;studies&quot; relied on the discredited work of
sex researcher Alfred C. Kinsey.  They exaggerate Kinsey's already
overblown findings of sexual deviance in the general population,
including the now-refuted 10 percent myth for homosexuality. 
Even Planned Parenthood, <I>The New Republic</I> and <I>Newsweek</I>
concede as much.  More reliable surveys indicate that the homosexual
population in America is less than two percent.
<P>
<LI> Testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, March
31, 1993.  Korb testified, &quot;Professor Theodore Sarbin, co-author
of a 1991 PERSEREC study for the U.S. military, has stated that
<I>there is no data linking gays to lower morale or cohesion</I>.
 Rather he (Sarbin) noted that where there's good leadership,
there's high morale.&quot;
<P>
This statement is without foundation.  PERSEREC omits any reference
to any scientific study of military unit cohesion and discipline
and their effect on combat readiness.  
<P>
The Pentagon's 1993 task force that studied the issue of homosexuals
in the military found hundreds of cases where servicemembers discovered
to be homosexual were very disruptive.  Mr. Korb's anecdotal account
is disputed by these cases.
<P>
A survey by the American Security Council Foundation found that
99 percent of active duty officers said homosexuals would undermine
the cohesiveness and readiness of combat units.[3] The Defense Readiness
Council compiled a survey of 2,800 retired flag and general officers.
 Nearly 90 percent said they believe homosexuals undermine morale.[4]
<P>
<LI>Testimony in the 1994 case of <I>Margarethe Cammermeyer v. Les
Aspin</I>.  Korb told that court: &quot;The policy was never intended
to authorize the military to discharge someone simply based on
his or her status -- absent any evidence of conduct.  To the contrary,
conduct was the real focus of the policy....A servicemember's
own admission of being gay -- absent any indication of her propensity
to engage in homosexual conduct -- is simply not sufficient grounds
for discharging her under the existing policy....The policy I
authorized should not be construed as authorizing such an irrational
outcome.&quot;[5]
<P>
The military's pre-1993 ban was based on the principle that, &quot;Homosexuality is incompatible with military service.&quot;  Decades of court
rulings have affirmed the military's position that declaring oneself
a homosexual implies the person has or will engage in illegal
homosexual behavior.  
<P>
<LI>Testimony in the 1995 case of <I>Abel et al. v. William Perry</I>.
 Korb told the court, &quot;We were losing a lot of very good
people in whom the government had invested a lot of money.&quot;
 He also compared the homosexual exclusion with women in the military.
&quot;I can't over-emphasize the great opposition from military
leaders to ending the draft and bringing women into the services.&quot;
 Korb said he once shared a room with a homosexual without any
problem.
<P>
The military releases three times as many people each year for
drug abuse than it does for homosexuality.  And homosexuals in
the military have a bad record: as a group, they have a high ratio
of discipline problems and account for most of the AIDS cases.
<P>
Homosexual activists often try to compare their agenda with the
integration of blacks into the military.  Former chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff General Colin Powell does not agree:  &quot;Skin
color is a benign, nonbehavioral characteristic.  Sexual orientation
is perhaps the most profound of human behavioral characteristics.
 Comparison of the two is a convenient but invalid argument.&quot;[6]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Justice Department and the Pentagon have many witnesses (active
duty and retired officers and civilians) who would refute the
half-truths presented by the pro-homosexual witnesses.  It is
inexplicable that in a politicized case like <I>Abel v. William
Perry,</I> the Justice Department failed to call experts to challenge
the misinformation promoted by homosexual groups.
<P>
The 104th Congress must demand that the Justice Department represent
the military's interests.  The evidence supports the military
homosexual law, but if the government is silent about the facts,
cases like this will be lost, and the destruction of military
morale will proceed unchecked.

<P>
In a lackluster performance, the Clinton Administration failed
to use key arguments and called no witnesses in the first court
test of the military's new homosexual law.  
<P>
On March 30, 1995, Judge Eugene Nickerson of the Eastern District
of New York struck down parts of the military's new homosexual
law and the Pentagon's implementing directives in the case of
<I>Lieutenant Colonel Jane Able, et al. v. United States of America</I>.[1]
<P>
Judge Nickerson ruled that six service members' First and Fifth
Amendment rights were violated when the military sought to discharge
them solely based on their admissions of homosexuality.  He enjoined
the Pentagon from discharging the six, and the Justice Department
is expected to appeal the case to the Second Circuit Court of
Appeals.
<P>
This case follows a pattern seen in the Steffan, Meinhold, and
Cammermeyer cases whereby the government ignores key arguments
for prohibiting service by avowed homosexuals.  These cases demonstrate
fundamental differences between the law, which was signed by President
Clinton on November 30, 1993, and the Pentagon's implementing
directions, which took effect February 28, 1994.
<P>
Specifically, the Justice Department failed to:
<P><UL>
<LI>Call witnesses to represent the government's interest.  The
plaintiffs called six &quot;expert&quot; witnesses to dispute
long-held &quot;myths&quot; about homosexuals. 
<P>
<LI>Present well documented arguments for denying homosexual service
based on physical and psychological problems.
<P>
<LI>Demonstrate that the policy is conduct-based rather than status-based
as the plaintiffs argued.
<P>
<LI>Show that homosexual &quot;lifestyles&quot; and &quot;values&quot;
are contrary to the best interests of the armed services and present
serious morale and unit cohesion problems.
<P>
<LI>Refute a flawed study cited by the plaintiffs as evidence that
homosexuals will not damage morale and unit cohesion.
<P>
<LI>Demonstrate that homosexuals present a risk to the military
and therefore the military's ban is justified.  
</UL>
The judge noted key differences between the law and the directives:
<P><UL>
<LI>Although the law permits asking about homosexual acts and orientation
at the point of admission, the Clinton Administration has rejected
the questions.  The judge labeled this as unusual.  On one hand
the Pentagon encourages homosexuals to join (by not making homosexuality
part of a pre-induction litmus test) and then insists that the
homosexual remain secretive about his &quot;status.&quot;
<P>
<LI>The law denies service to homosexuals, but the directives permit
service to admitted homosexuals who can rebut the presumption
that they will engage in homosexual misconduct.  This creates
a status/conduct dichotomy.  The judge labels the rebuttable presumption
as &quot;Orwellian.&quot;
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>FIRST AMENDMENT ARGUMENT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The plaintiffs complain that the government violated their First
Amendment rights when it tried to discharge them for stating that
they are homosexual.  
<P>
The military law [10 U.S.C. 654(b)(2)] permits discharge when
&quot;the member has stated that he or she is a homosexual or
bisexual, or words to that effect, unless there is a further finding,
made and approved in accordance with procedures set forth in the
regulations, that the member has demonstrated that he or she is
not a person who engages in, attempts to engage in, has a propensity
to engage in, or intends to engage in homosexual acts.&quot; 
The Pentagon's directives which implement this law [DoD Directive
1332.14 and 1332.30] have the same litmus test.
<P>
The government argued that this is not a First Amendment issue
because the law and the directives are directed solely at the
prohibition of acts and give members the opportunity to rebut
the presumption of misconduct.  However, the government failed
to show a nexus between a declaration of homosexuality and homosexual
misconduct.  In fact, government lawyers labeled much of the available
evidence as &quot;myths,&quot; thus aiding the plaintiffs.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3> GOVERNMENT FAILED TO EXPLAIN RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH HOMOSEXUALS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The judge noted that the government made no argument to exclude
homosexuals based on &quot;mental illness,&quot; security or infectious
diseases.  In fact, Justice Department lawyers dismissed these
well-founded arguments as &quot;myths.&quot;  Consider the facts.
<P>
<B>Homosexuals as a category present unacceptable risks.</B>
Research shows that homosexuals tend to be extremely promiscuous
and tend to have high incidences of sexually transmitted diseases,
especially the deadly AIDS virus.
<P>
Admitting homosexuals into the military violates the legal principle
of the assumption of risk.  This principle states that if you
know there is a risk and you assume it, then don't complain when
the risk materializes.  
<P>
A recent study from the University of Michigan found that people
with HIV are more capable of spreading the virus during the first
60 days of infection but that blood tests during this period do
not find the HIV antibodies.[2] This means that the military assumes
some risk, even though all personnel are initially tested, that
soldiers are not infected.  This is why screening out high-risk
groups and not just those who test positive for HIV is appropriate.
 Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration no longer screens out
homosexuals -- by far the highest risk group for contracting HIV.
<P>
The Army's Surgeon General, Lieutenant General Alcide Lanoue,
has addressed the health risks associated with homosexuals:[3]
<P><UL>
<LI>&quot;The military setting provides unique requirements for
safety in executing the Army blood transfusion program and for
preventing the transmission of blood-borne pathogens (especially
HIV and hepatitis B) in the field setting.  Homosexual males would
comprise a pool of ineligible blood donors and as a group are
at high risk of infection by HIV and hepatitis B, both significant
blood-borne pathogens which can infect other soldiers through
exposure to blood in peace and war.&quot; [During Operation Desert
Storm, there were five documented instances where blood was drawn
directly from soldiers and transfused.  In Somalia, five units
of blood were drawn from soldiers and directly transfused to Somalis.
 The urgency of such transfusions precludes testing for the AIDS
virus.]
<P>
<LI>&quot;HIV and other Sexually Transmitted Disease rates will
increase to the extent that the proportion of homosexual males
in the Army increases because homosexual/bisexual men are allowed
to enter and remain in the Army.&quot; [The CDC reports that most
of the AIDS patients in this country are homosexuals.[4] Homosexuals
account for a disproportionate number of America's most serious
STD's, including syphilis, gonorrhea, genital warts, and hepatitis
A and B.[5] Moreover, the 1994 homosexual sex survey in <I>The Advocate</I>,
a mainstream homosexual magazine, found that 13 percent of respondents
were HIV-positive and only 18 percent had taken all three shots
in the hepatitis B vaccine series.  <I>The Advocate</I> article
admits that, &quot;Gay men are one of the top risk groups for
being exposed to hepatitis B.[6]
<P>
<LI> &quot;A male homosexual soldier is significantly more likely
than a heterosexual soldier to be nondeployable for medical reasons
related to HIV infection.  If HIV-infected, the soldier will be
permanently nondeployable.  Male homosexuals are more likely to
acquire sexually transmitted diseases which can render them nondeployable,
such as gonorrhea, syphilis, and hepatitis B.
</UL>
&quot;Readiness from a medical standpoint will suffer if the restriction
is lifted.  The impact would be felt at the unit level, when the
homosexual soldier cannot train and deploy for health reasons.
 Likewise, the impact would be felt Army-wide in terms of the
military blood program and of the burden placed on the Army health
care system.&quot;
<P>
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, homosexuals
are especially vulnerable to contracting HIV.  They are a high-risk
group because of co-factors associated with their lifestyle. 
These include recreational drug use, homosexual sex, malnutrition,
prior incidents of sexually transmitted diseases, and, most significantly,
sexual promiscuity.  
<P>
Homosexuals who participate in unsafe sex practices with multiple
partners and without taking precautions are at great risk of contracting
sexually transmitted diseases.  <I>The Advocate</I> survey found
that 72 percent of homosexual respondents engage in insertive
oral intercourse, 46 percent insertive anal intercourse, 45 percent
receptive anal-oral sex, 48 percent in three-way sex, 24 percent
in group sex (4 or more), and 10 percent in sadomasochism.[7] Most
of the homosexuals in the survey admitted to having had more than
30 sex partners over their lifetime, and more than a third (35%)
report more than 100 partners.  The survey also found that only
one time in four do homosexual men use condoms.[8]
<P>
Heterosexuals have fewer sex partners than homosexuals.  A 1988-1990
General Social Survey found that 91 percent of men 25 to 29 years
of age are heterosexually active.  Nineteen percent of these men
have had only one sex partner, 55 percent have had two to 19 partners,
and 25 percent have had 20 or more partners.[9]
<P>
The University of Chicago published a national sex survey in October,
1994, which found that 20 percent of men have had only one sex
partner in their lifetime, 21 percent have had two to four partners,
17 percent 5 to 10 partners, 16 percent 11 to 20 and 17 percent
report having had 21 or more sex partners.[10] However, that survey
excluded men over 59, who constitute one-sixth of the population
and who typically have had more conservative sex lives.  Thus
the real figures probably are even lower for the population of
all men.[11]
<P>
Homosexuality also increases medical costs.  With the ban in place,
openly homosexual inductees are turned away.  However, with the
ban lifted, a homosexual recruit could contract HIV within days
of induction or have early-stage HIV and not test positive and
be accorded full medical benefits for the rest of his life.  This
is about $120,000 in direct medical costs per AIDS patient.[12]
<P>
Dr. Edmund Tramont, Associate Director for retroviral research
at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, published a 10-year projection
for HIV costs at $1.7 to $1.9 billion.[13] He warns that this is
in 1989 dollars, is based on the present rate of new cases and
assumes that only 60 percent of health care beneficiaries will
use the military health care system.  The potential 10-year cost
could rise to $5 billion if these assumptions are incorrect.[14]
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services indicates that
the lifetime cost of treating a person with AIDS -- from diagnosis
until death -- is $102,000.[15] The American Medical Association
estimated the per-person AIDS patient cost would rise to $386,000
by the year 2000 and $639,000 by the year 2008.[16]
<P>
As of April 1993 the military had dealt with 8,832 HIV-positive
service members.  Most have been separated, but at that time 1,580
were still on active duty.  Their status precluded them from deploying
overseas and necessitated special assignments and special medical
care.[17]
<P>
Homosexuals also have much shorter life expectancy than heterosexuals
as indicated by a study of more than 6,737 obituaries published
in <I>Omega: Journal of Death and Dying</I>.  The average age
of homosexuals who died from AIDS is 39; from all other causes
it is 42.[18]
<P>
Substance addiction and abuse represent the second key health
problems after AIDS in the homosexual subculture (with violence
the third).[19] A report by the National Lesbian-Gay Health Foundation
found that homosexuals -- men and women -- are about three times
as likely as heterosexuals to have an alcohol or drug abuse problem.[20]
<P>
While the 1992 GAO report states that the military spent $26 million
on homosexuals discharged,  it spent many times that figure treating
homosexuals with AIDS -- people who lied to enter the military
and now receive full health and pay benefits.  The cost-effective
decision would be to minimize the risk to the federal taxpayer
by rejecting homosexuals before they are recruited and discharging
those later discovered.
<P>
The 1992 GAO report also found that women are discharged for homosexuality
four times as often as men.  They are much more likely to be processed
under administrative discharge procedures than men.
<P>
Lesbians are also disruptive to unit morale and cohesion.  Pentagon
records include vignettes[21] such as the case of a female sergeant
who drank too much.  She approached four different women at a
base social club making sexually explicit remarks and grabbing
one woman's buttocks.  She was arrested on charges of indecent
assault.
<P>
A female veteran told her account of another female soldier who
made sexual advances in a barracks.  &quot;I was stuck in the
same barracks with that person for three months.  I had to get
up and look at that person every day.  She [the homosexual] insisted
on trying to find a mate in the barracks, and by the end of the
training, everyone has [sic] lost morale.&quot;
<P>
A female basic training soldier complained to her drill sergeant
that other female trainees were &quot;making out&quot; in a common
area.  The sergeant subsequently found seven female soldiers partially
dressed, embracing each other, holding hands, and kissing.  The
seven admitted they were lesbians and said that they were consenting
adults.  They stated they had not engaged in sexual activities,
and their lifestyle had nothing to do with being a good soldier.
<P>
A female air force veteran was assigned a lesbian roommate.  She
made strong sexual advances to the straight airwoman, so much
so that the airwoman left her room and slept on the floor in a
friend's barracks.
<P>
<B>The Justice Department ignored evidence showing that homosexuality
is a pathology.</B>  
<P>
Rather, contrary to long-established military precedence, the
government embraced the concept that homosexuality is normal or
at least of little consequence.  Labeling homosexuality as other
than a pathology is a serious mistake.
<P>
The military's World War II experience provided considerable insight
into human behavior.  Specialists in military medicine literally
rewrote the diagnostic codes and nomenclature for psychiatric
disorders.  Since 1945, the Army has consistently held that homosexuality
is a behavioral problem, not a mental disease.[22]
<P>
In 1952, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) Council approved
and published a new nomenclature for categorizing mental disorders
similar to those used by the military.[23] In the more than 40 years
since that time, the APA, under pressure from militant homosexual
groups, has progressively changed the nomenclature so as to remove
the negative connotations implicit in the terms &quot;sexual deviation&quot;
or &quot;pathology.&quot;
<P>
During its annual meetings from 1969 through 1971, the APA was
besieged by activists demanding the recognition of homosexual
behavior as normal.  In 1971, homosexual activists invaded the
annual meeting and denounced psychiatry as &quot;the enemy incarnate.&quot;[24]
<P>
In 1973, activists challenged the New England Psychiatric Society
to rename the section on &quot;sexual deviation&quot; to &quot;sexual
dysfunction.&quot;  Later that year, APA trustees ruled that homosexuality
would no longer be listed in its official nomenclature of mental
disorders but, rather, would be referred to as &quot;sexual orientation
disturbance.&quot;[25]
<P>
The revision of nomenclature continued when, in 1986, the last
remaining term, &quot;ego-dystonic homosexuality,&quot; was removed
from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders.
 This was done over the strong protest of many psychiatrists who
preferred to label homosexuality a long standing disturbance originating
in the early years of life.[26]
<P>
A survey of the American Medical Association membership in 1975
found that 69 percent agreed that homosexuality is &quot;pathological.&quot;[27]
 An argument used by those who promote homosexuality is that this
proclivity is inborn and irreversible.  Numerous psychotherapists,
including Elizabeth Moberly, Gerald van den Aardweg, Joseph Nicolosi,
Charles Socarides, and Masters and Johnson have reported significant
success in helping homosexuals to recover, thereby proving it
is a curable pathology.[28]
<P>
Despite considerable evidence of success in gender reparative
therapy, the APA, under pressure from gay activists, voted to
stop recommending efforts to turn unhappy homosexuals into heterosexuals.
 In December 1994, AMA's governing House of Delegates called for
a &quot;nonjudgmental recognition of sexual orientation by physicians.&quot;[29]
<P>
<B>The government ignored evidence that homosexuals are a security
risk by relying on a debunked government report which suggests
that homosexuals are no more at risk of blackmail than heterosexuals.</B>
<P>
The primary study comes from the Defense Personnel Security Research
and Education Center (PERSEREC), an agency of the Department of
Defense.[30] Although the report contains much sloppy research and
misinformation, it is frequently cited by one of the plaintiffs'
key witnesses in this case, former Assistant Secretary of Defense
Lawrence J. Korb.
<P>
Few people identify themselves as heterosexual; that identity
is assumed.  Homosexuals do, indeed, identify themselves, however.
<P>
Landmark research by Alan Bell and Martin Weinberg, <I>Homosexualities:
A Study of Diversity Among Men and Women</I>, found that a significant
number of homosexuals report that &quot;someone has threatened
[them with] exposure of homosexuality in order to get something
of value.&quot;[31]
<P>
If the threat of blackmail were the only problem with homosexuals
in the military, then lifting the prohibition might be justified.
 However, homosexuals should not serve for many reasons, and security
investigations are a valid mechanism for enforcing the law.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>JUDGE SEES A STATUS V. CONDUCT DICHOTOMY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The legal fiction that an admission of homosexuality is not a
valid presumption of misconduct has long been dismissed by the
courts.  For many years, the military has won homosexual cases
because the courts recognize that people don't label themselves
homosexuals without some experience or intent to engage in the
defining behavior.  The Clinton Administration tried to finesse
this point in court but failed to persuade the judge, who labeled
the government's arguments as &quot;Orwellian.&quot;
<P>
Because the government failed to show a connection between a declaration
of homosexuality and misconduct, the judge understandably concluded
&quot;that the admission of homosexuals did not pose an uncontrollable
risk that they would commit acts inherently dangerous to morale,
good order, and discipline....&quot;
<P>
<CENTER><H3>JUDGE RELIES ON DEBUNKED STUDY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The government argued that homosexuals create sexual tension in
single-gender organizations.  This tension undermines morale and
cohesion which are key to military readiness.
<P>
The plaintiffs dismiss this argument by citing a Rand Corporation
study which concludes &quot;although some disruptions might result
from having acknowledged homosexuals serving in the military....the
experience of analogous [non-military] organizations...suggests
that any increase is likely to be quite small.&quot;
<P>
In 1993, Secretary of Defense Les Aspin commissioned the Rand
Corporation to study lifting the military's homosexual ban.  The
Rand study cost $1.3 million and contains inaccurate or misleading
information and inappropriate parallels.
<P><UL>
<LI>Judge Nickerson cites Rand's report on other countries, &quot;[N]o
serious problems were reported concerning the presence of homosexuals
in the force.&quot;
<P>
Rand ignored the June 1993 GAO report on &quot;Homosexuals in
the Military: Policies and Practices of Foreign Countries.&quot;[32]
 The GAO reviewed 25 countries and selected four countries for
detailed analysis.  The report states that 11 countries have policies
that do not permit homosexuals to serve in the military, 11 have
policies that do.  Three of the latter 11 countries do not have
any laws, regulations, or policies that address this issue.  An
unpublished Pentagon study conducted in December 1992 found that
some of those countries that permit homosexuals to serve do so
with strict limitations. 
<P>
Testimony before the Senate and House Armed Services Committees
(SASC and HASC) in April and May 1993 illustrates the dramatic
differences between foreign militaries and our own.  For example,
the Netherlands started a homosexual military experiment in 1974.
 That nation has 65,000 service members, including 40,000 conscripts
who serve 14 months and who primarily commute from home each day.
 The U.S. has 2.5 million active and reserve service personnel
stationed in the U.S. and around the world at any given time.
 The U.S. routinely participates in combat operations, something
the Dutch have not done for 50 years.      
The German armed forces, which are included among those that do
<I>not</I> have an exclusionary policy, will not induct acknowledged
homosexual volunteers because they would &quot;undermine military
order and discipline.&quot;[33] Of the 476,300 members, 43 percent
are conscripts who, if identified as homosexual, may be required
to undergo psychological tests to determine their fitness.  The
German Federal Administrative Court declared in November 1990
that the military is justified in not allowing homosexuals to
serve in leadership and educational positions.
<P>
Foreign social experiences have little relevance for America's
military.  The U.S. is a superpower with urgent missions worldwide.
 America also has a radical homosexual community and a liberal
judicial system, a combination that guarantees a steady stream
of legal activism that is disruptive to military morale.
<P>
<LI>Judge Nickerson cites the 1992 GAO study on analogous organizations
which &quot;accepted homosexuals into their ranks...[and] have
generally not reported adverse impacts.&quot;
<P>
Rand's &quot;analogous organizations&quot; are fire and police
departments.  Researchers visited six cities and concluded that
homosexuals were integrated through clear and simple policies,
aggressive leadership and adherence to strict standards of conduct.
 The report prescribes the same approach for the military.
<P>
Rand ignores the important lessons from San Francisco Chief of
Police Anthony D. Ribera, who told the HASC on May 7, 1993 that
his department experiences a &quot;significantly higher&quot;
number of AIDS deaths among homosexual officers.  His department
routinely tests for Hepatitis B -- as demanded by the policemen's
union.  And they rely on local hospitals rather than other officers
for emergency blood.
<P>
San Francisco's officers also go home evenings or, as in the Seattle
Fire Department, occupy private cubicles when required to stay
overnight.  Additionally, homosexual officers serve primarily
in homosexual districts and, as in New York City, no one is forced
to pair up with a homosexual.  Chief Ribera concludes, &quot;Our
experience is remotely parallel to the military.&quot;
<P>
Sgt. Edward Striedinger of the Seattle Police Department told
the HASC about female officers who complained about advances from
lesbian officers.  These women refused to file formal complaints,
citing fear of reprisals. 
<P>
The parallels between paramilitary and military organizations
are mostly cosmetic, such as wearing side-arms and uniforms. 
The differences are pronounced but ignored in Rand's briefing.
<P>
<LI>Judge Nickerson cites Rand's study on racial integration of
the services stating, integration &quot;did not 'destroy' unit
cohesion and military effectiveness.&quot;
<P>
Rand equates the evolving &quot;discriminatory&quot; homosexual
policy with the integration of blacks into the military.  General
Colin Powell has rejected the linkage: &quot;Skin color is [a]
benign, nonbehavioral characteristic.  Sexual orientation is perhaps
the most profound of human behavioral characteristics.  Comparison
of the two is a convenient but invalid argument.&quot;[34]
<P>
The Council of 100 (a national organization of African-American
Republicans founded in 1974) points out differences in the moral
and social climate in 1948 (when President Truman directed the
military to integrate), and the fact that blacks had honorably
and openly served since the Revolutionary War.  The Council said
that the homosexual discrimination argument is &quot;a disingenuous
strategy to divert attention from the real issues&quot; of readiness
and cohesion.[35]
<P>
The integration of avowed homosexuals brings into the military
services individuals whose behavior violates federal law.  The
integration of black Americans involved no behavioral assumptions.
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>FIFTH AMENDMENT ARGUMENT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The government argued that heterosexual service members &quot;will
be upset by a co-worker's mere statement of homosexuality&quot;
and as a result refuse to work cooperatively.  The judge labels
this unjustified discrimination.
<P>
The government once again failed to present compelling evidence
that homosexual &quot;lifestyles&quot; and &quot;values&quot;
are incompatible with military service.
<P>
Consider the implications of homosexual service for military morale.
<P>
Morale means &quot;a strong sense of enthusiasm and dedication
to a commonly shared goal that unifies a group.&quot;  Heterosexual
soldiers forced to live and work with avowed homosexuals cannot
be expected to submit to sexual tension with &quot;...a strong
sense of enthusiasm.&quot;  
<P>
Open homosexuals tend to derive their basic identity from their
sexual orientation and practice: &quot;I am a homosexual,&quot;
as opposed to the American soldier's basic identity: &quot;I am
a soldier.&quot;  The homosexual's preoccupation with individual
behavioral characteristics is incongruent with and detracts from
the commonly shared goal -- accomplishment of the mission -- which
unifies heterosexual soldiers and subordinates their individual
goals to that of the group.
<P>
The homosexual subculture is recognized as &quot;liberated,&quot;
or in a manner of speaking, undisciplined.  This is inherently
at odds with the 24-hour discipline system within which soldiers
must live and work.  Homosexuals are distinguished from other
subcultures by their behavior [sodomy].  One group behavioral
characteristic is a very high rate of promiscuity.  Military records
indicate that homosexuals are statistically more likely to engage
in misconduct than heterosexuals.  They have a higher incidence
of drug and alcohol abuse than heterosexuals.  If these aren't
enough, much-touted books such as Randy Shilts' <I>Conduct Unbecoming</I>
and Mary Ann Humphrey's <I>My Country, My Right to Serve</I> provide,
perhaps unwittingly, ample testimony to the disruptive nature
of homosexuals in military units.[36]
<P>
The voice of experience indicates that homosexuals jeopardize
military morale.  For example, a survey of active duty officers
conducted for the American Security Council Foundation found that
99.03 percent said homosexuals would undermine the cohesiveness
and readiness of combat units.[37] The Defense Readiness Council
compiled a survey of 2,800 retired flag and general officers.
 Nearly 90 percent said they believe homosexuals undermine morale.[38]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>JUDGE MAKES NO MORAL DECISION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Judge Nickerson explained that his task &quot;is to determine
the constitutionality of the policy adopted by Congress, not its
morality.&quot;  He argues that everyone is &quot;entitled to
think it demeaning and unworthy of a great nation to base a policy
on pretense rather than on truth.&quot;
<P>
The judge suggests that constitutionality and morality may not
agree in this case, but many soldiers think this is clearly a
morality issue.  And requiring soldiers to &quot;tolerate&quot;
homosexuality will lead to recruitment and retention problems.
 The <I>Los Angeles Times</I> survey found that 46 percent of
soldiers said lifting the ban would enter into their reenlistment
decision and 11 percent would not reenlist because of it.  A February
1993 <I>CNN/Gallup Poll</I> found that, among men who had not
attended college, the prime recruiting population, 74 percent
opposed lifting the ban.  
<P>
The judge's labeling this a &quot;pretense&quot; is based on the
Clinton Administration's decision to stop asking recruits whether
they are homosexual.  Asking the question keeps honest homosexuals
out and sends a clear message that to serve, others must keep
their homosexuality a secret.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
It is expected that the Supreme Court will hear this case by 1997.
 As long as the government permits homosexuals to serve and as
long as the Clinton Administration's implementing directives flout
the law, however, the outcome is in doubt.
<P>
The 104th Congress must take legislative action to stop the evasion
of reality.  The Clinton Administration should be required to
abide by the law and the Justice Department must defend the law
using longstanding and successful arguments.

<TITLE>ACCREDITATION COUNCIL MANDATES ABORTION TRAINING </TITLE>

MANDATES ABORTION TRAINING</H2>

<P>
On February 14, 1995, the 23-member Accreditation Council for
Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) voted unanimously to pass new
regulations mandating that all medical residents specializing
in obstetrics and gynecology be trained to perform elective abortions.
 Individual residents expressing moral or religious objections
would be able to opt out of the abortion training.  However, medical
institutions opposed to abortion, such as Catholic hospitals,
would still be required -- in order to maintain their accredited
status -- to provide their students with abortion training by
arranging for their students to receive such training at another
location.
<P>
The wording of the new requirement is as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;Experience with induced abortion must be part of residency
education, except for residents with moral or religious objections.
 This education can be provided outside the institution.  Experience
with management of complications of abortion must be provided
to all residents.  If a residency program has a religious, moral
or legal restriction which prohibits the residents from performing
abortions within the institution, the program must ensure that
the residents receive a satisfactory education and experience
managing the complications of abortion.  Furthermore, such residency
programs must have mechanisms which ensure that residents in their
program who do not have a religious or moral objection receive
education and experience in performing abortion at another institution.&quot;[1]
<P></BLOCKQUOTE>
Programs which fail to comply with the new regulations risk losing
their accreditation.  Accreditation status qualifies teaching
hospitals to receive federal reimbursement for services which
medical residents provide to patients.  Moreover, doctors must
ordinarily graduate from accredited training programs to get certified
as competent in their specialties.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>DECLINE IN ABORTION PROVIDERS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Over the last twenty years, the number of medical schools offering
elective abortion training to their residents has declined.  In
1976, 92.5 percent of U.S. 
medical schools offered first-trimester abortion training, either
on a routine (26.3 percent) or optional basis (66.2 percent).
 This contrasts with 1991 figures in which 68.8 percent of medical
schools offered first-trimester abortion training -- 12.4 percent
on a routine basis, 56.4 percent on an optional basis.[2] Second-trimester
abortion training is only slightly less common than first-trimester
training programs (65.4 percent vs. 68.8 percent respectively),
but fewer medical schools routinely offer second-trimester abortion
training (6.7 percent); more provide optional training (58.7 percent).[3]
<P>
About one third of medical schools refuse to provide abortion
training due to moral and/or legal reasons.  For example, Catholic-affiliated
hospitals -- which make up about 20 percent of all U.S. hospitals
-- do not perform elective abortions because of religious and
moral beliefs.[4] Other hospitals, such as the publicly financed
Truman Medical Center in Missouri, are legally prohibited from
performing abortions because laws in several states -- including
Missouri -- bar the use of taxpayer money to fund abortions.[5]
<P>
In addition to the declining number of medical schools which provide
abortion training, fewer physicians are willing to perform abortions.
 A Columbia University survey found that nearly half of the ob/gyn
chief residents graduating each year have never performed a first-trimester
abortion.[6]
<P>
Overall, the Alan Guttmacher Institute (AGI) reports that the
number of hospitals, clinics, and physicians' offices that provide
abortions -- 2,380 in 1992 -- has been declining at a rate of
about 65 a year.  Most of the decline can be attributed to hospitals;
the number of hospitals providing abortions decreased by 18 percent
between 1988 and 1992.[7]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>ENSURING THAT WOMEN HAVE A CHOICE?</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Proponents of ACGME's new regulations such as the National Abortion
Federation, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the
Feminist Majority Foundation, the Center for Reproductive Law
and Policy, and the current leadership of the American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) point to the decline
in abortion providers as justification for the mandate.  They
emphasize that unless the procedure is required, many ob/gyn students
will choose to opt out of abortion training, thereby decreasing
access to abortion.
<P>
Abortion advocacy groups hope the ACGME mandate will help bring
abortion back into the &quot;mainstream&quot; of ob/gyn practice.
 Currently, the vast majority of abortions are performed in clinics,
isolating abortion from the general practice of medicine.  Abortionists
also say they frequently feel less respected by their colleagues
and society in general.  By including abortion as a necessary
ob/gyn service, abortion proponents hope to remove the taint associated
with abortion and also reduce the targeting of clinics by abortion
protesters.
<P>
Finally, the ACGME cited patient safety as a reason to require
abortion training.  Dr. John C. Gienapp, Ph.D., executive director
of ACGME, said, &quot;Those physicians who choose to develop appropriate
medical skills in the area of abortion must be trained adequately.&quot;[8]
 The American Medical Association agreed, saying in a statement,
&quot;For the safety of patients, it is essential that physicians
providing abortion services are trained and competent.&quot;[9]
<P>
While the new regulations will not go into effect until January
1, 1996, abortion advocacy groups as well as several medical societies
-- including ACOG -- have lobbied the ACGME for over a year to
adopt such a policy change.[10]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>OR REMOVING CHOICE FROM OB/GYN PHYSICIANS?</H3></CENTER>
<P>
ACGME's new abortion mandate has received considerable opposition
-- from pro-life groups to many within the medical establishment.
 &quot;Pro-choice&quot; physician James Schreiber, M.D., chief
of obstetrics and gynecology at Washington University Medical
Center in St. Louis, denounced the new policy as coercive and
&quot;anti-choice,&quot; saying that institutions with moral objections
were &quot;being forced into an untenable position.&quot;[11]
<P>
Richard T. F. Schmidt, M.D., a former ACOG president (1977-1978)
and residency review committee member, also questions the rationale
behind the abortion training mandate.  In a letter to ACGME's
ob/gyn residency review committee, Dr. Schmidt wrote, &quot;Is
there a demonstrated lack of knowledge or technical competence
among program graduates?  Or is the purpose to make more residents
comfortable with the <I>idea</I> of elective abortion and its
performance?&quot;  Commenting on the diminishing number of programs
offering elective abortion training, Dr. Schmidt said that given
a choice, faculty and residents &quot;voted very clearly with
their feet.&quot;[12]
<P>
The Christian Medical and Dental Society (CMDS), the American
Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops, and other pro-life and pro-family
groups have also registered their strong opposition to the new
mandate.  These groups argue that requiring residents to undergo
abortion training will have the effect of dissuading many pro-life
medical students from choosing to specialize in ob/gyn.  These
groups also believe that residents will receive intense pressure
from within the medical school to undergo abortion training due
to the accreditation requirement.[13]
<P>
The fears these groups express may well be justified.  An editorial
published in the <I>New England Journal of Medicine</I> indicates
that ob/gyn residents will receive considerable pressure to undergo
elective abortion training.  The author of the editorial, an advocate
of the new ACGME requirements, writes that &quot;[r]esidents who
wish to opt out of abortion training should be required to explain
why in a way that satisfies <I>stringent</I> and <I>explicit</I>
criteria&quot; (emphasis added).[14]  Furthermore, two years ago the
University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill
found that greater numbers of residents were refusing to perform
abortions even though the school provided training.  As a result,
the school sent a letter to all prospective residents in the summer
of 1993 saying that it would accept only candidates who agreed
to perform abortions.  The policy was rescinded after threats
of a class-action lawsuit.[15]
<P>
The North Carolina scenario demonstrates that ACGME's new policies
were not passed in response to ob/gyn residents who wanted to
receive abortion training but were unable to receive it.  Such
a conclusion is also supported by a recently released survey by
the American Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a
recognized special interest group within the American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG).  With almost 25 percent
of the 36,000 ACOG members responding, the survey found that 59
percent of respondents felt that abortion training should <U>not</U>
be required in residency programs.[16]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>IMPACTS OF THE ABORTION TRAINING MANDATE</H3></CENTER>
<P>
ACGME's new requirements seem to be implicitly directed at teaching
residents to perform second- and third-trimester abortions.  As
Congressman and family physician/obstetrician Tom Coburn (R-OK)
has testified, medical residents already receive training in handling
spontaneous abortions (miscarriages) through dilation and curettage
(D &amp; C), which is the usual technique used for first-trimester
abortions.  Only later-term abortions require additional training
in special techniques to &quot;terminate the pregnancy.&quot;[17]
<P>
The new policy would also require teaching hospitals to provide
or obtain additional facilities, equipment, and faculty (or contract
with other institutions to do so).  Furthermore, hospitals which
have not historically referred patients for abortions because
of moral reasons and which refuse to provide abortion training
on-site would nonetheless be forced to violate their fundamental
beliefs and directly collaborate with abortion providers.  The
mandate also violates laws in roughly half the states that exempt
hospitals from referring for abortion, contraception, or sterilization
when the hospital is conscientiously opposed.
<P>
Because the abortion training mandate does conflict with several
states' laws, it can also be reasonably expected that Planned
Parenthood and other abortion providers will file lawsuits to
change the laws which (1) exempt hospitals from referring for
abortion, and (2) explicitly ban the use of taxpayer monies to
fund abortions in publicly-funded hospitals.

<P>
<I>Lt. Col. Robert L. Maginnis (U.S.A., Ret.)</I></CENTER>
<P>
The forced feminization of the Navy is undermining combat readiness
and Congress must exercise its Constitutional responsibility to
examine these politically motivated changes before more damage
is done.
<P>
Defense Secretary William Perry promised, &quot;Our over-arching
goal is to maintain a high-quality, ready and effective force.
 By increasing the numbers of units and positions to which women
can be assigned, the military services gain greater flexibility
in the development and use of human resources.&quot;[1] 
<P>
Unfortunately, Mr. Perry has set a course to feminize the Navy
without regard for military necessity.  Today, 94 percent of Navy
billets, including previously exempt combat positions, are open
to women.  Secretary Perry promotes these changes as &quot;equal
opportunity.&quot;[2]
<P>
Consider factors that seriously impair Navy readiness.
<P><UL>
<LI>A Navy study found that women are NOT physically equipped to
perform most at-sea emergency tasks.
<P>
<LI>A 1995 Navy policy embraces pregnancy as an acceptable readiness
problem in spite of the fact that almost half of pregnant sailors
never return to their crews after delivery.
<P>
<LI>Fraternization is a growing problem among crew members aboard
mixed-gender ships and this contributes to serious morale and
cohesion problems at sea.  It also has a negative effect on the
well-being of military spouses back home.
<P>
<LI>The Navy has ignored longstanding screening standards in order
to accelerate less qualified women into positions, thus bypassing
more experienced men.
<P>
<LI>Sexual harassment charges are a favorite tool of some women
who manipulate Navy leaders to promote personal agendas.
<P>
<LI>The Defense Department has promised to raise the percentage
of female servicemembers to perhaps 25 percent of the total force.[3]
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>STUDY SAYS WOMEN ARE DIFFERENT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Navy has ignored key findings which demonstrate that women
are less equipped physically to perform assignments aboard combat ships.
 The Navy Personnel Research and Development Center in San Diego,
California, conducted a comprehensive study of 350 men and 195
women to determine what effect training had on their physical
performances.  The study measured performance on five basic damage
control tasks: carrying litters on level surfaces and up and down
ladders, moving and starting emergency pumps, turning engine bolts,
and directing fire hose streams.  Virtually all male recruits
were able to perform all of the tasks before training, while women
could perform only one of the tasks to a satisfactory standard.[4]
<P>
Even after significant training, women showed no appreciable improvement.
 The study found that the differences between the sexes on measures
of lifting strength and aerobic capacity are dramatic.  
<P>
All naval crewmembers must be prepared to perform damage control
assignments.  Lack of physical strength among female sailors can
decrease survivability.  For example, had more women been aboard
the <I>USS Stark</I>, crippled by an Iraqi missile in the Persian
Gulf, the loss of life and property would very likely have been
greater.
<P>
Analogous organization experiences show similar trends.  Civilian
fire departments have reported disproportionate differences between
the sexes in injury rates when women are expected to perform like
men.  They suffer up to three times as many disabling back injuries
as men.[5] Women suffer more injuries because to lift the same load
as men, they must operate near their maximum lifting capacity,
e.g., a male medic carrying a litter uses on the average half
of his lifting power, but a woman uses on average her full lifting
capacity.
<P>
The 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in
the Armed Forces found that women's aerobic capacity is significantly
lower, meaning they cannot carry as much as far as fast as men.
 Despite the existence of an exceedingly small number of Amazonian
women who resemble men in muscular mass, on average, women are
shorter, have less muscle mass and weigh less than men.  This
puts them at a distinct disadvantage when performing tasks requiring
a high level of muscular strength and aerobic capacity.[6]
<P>
The Commission also found that women are at a higher risk for
exercise-induced injuries than men, with 2.13 times greater risk
for lower extremity injuries, and 4.71 times greater risk for
stress fractures.[7]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>PREGNANCY POLICY HURTS READINESS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Navy's 1995 pregnancy policy ignores readiness while favoring
protection of individuals' rights.  As the number of women in
the Navy increases, pregnancy becomes a serious readiness issue.
<P>
At any given time, up to 18 percent of Navy women are pregnant
and a study of two ships showed a pregnancy rate as high as one
in three.[8] That's nearly 8,423 women or enough to crew almost
two aircraft carriers.  During Desert Storm 1,145 women on ships
needed to be reassigned because of pregnancies, at an average
of 95 per month.[9]
<P>
According to the policy, a woman may serve aboard ship until she
is 20 weeks pregnant.  While aboard ship, she must never be more
than six hours from emergency OB/GYN care.  Perhaps this provision
exists because at least five babies have been born on Navy ships,
one of which died shortly after birth.  Obviously, this policy
limits the pregnant sailor's deployability and her job performance
is frequently limited.
<P>
On average, each pregnancy taken to term removes a female sailor
from her ship for at least six months.  Once the child is born,
the sailor receives six weeks of convalescent leave and is not
required to re-deploy for four months.  That period can be extended
by the attending physician.  Many women never return to their
ship after giving birth.  According to Navy records, 35 percent
leave the Navy and eight percent remain on shore.    
<P>
Those who do return are unable to devote full time to their infant,
often creating an unhealthy reliance on child care at an extremely
impressionable age for the child.  Extended care for children
during frequent deployments denies the child the nurturing that
is key to a balanced emotional composition.   
<P>
According to Jay Belsky writing in the <I>Journal of Marriage
and the Family</I>, children left in child care while mothers
work &quot;scored more poorly on a composite measure of adjustment
than did children whose mothers were not employed during their
first three years....[and they] were significantly more noncompliant
than agemates without such early experience.&quot;[10]  These problems
are made worse as the mother-child separations are longer and
more frequent.
<P>
According to the Defense Manpower Data Center, two thirds of all
uniformed female mothers of one child have never married.  There
are never-married servicemembers with as many as nine dependents.
 Today, there are 84,831 never-married female active duty members
from all services with at least one child.[11]
<P>
Unmarried female servicemembers with at-home dependents are eligible
for benefits identical to married members.  For example, they
receive larger government quarters (more children means more bedrooms),
larger allowances driven by family size (such as cost of living
allowances), government-subsidized child care and medical care.
 During each pregnancy the servicemember is provided all pay and
allowances, time off and free medical benefits.
<P>
If a pregnant sailor wants an abortion she must be transported
off the ship to a location near an abortion clinic.  Before this
happens Navy personnel must counsel her about her options.  If
she chooses abortion, she is given, at government expense, a complete
blood count (CBC) to determine whether to administer Rhogam to
prevent an immune reaction.  After the abortion, the Navy provides
medical attention for problems arising from the procedure, like
clinical depression or an incomplete abortion.  The costs for
this treatment are borne by the Navy.
<P>
Navy policy prohibits supervisors from taking action against a
woman who becomes pregnant during a deployment, and there is no
requirement for women to use birth control during deployments.
 One command did, however, send a message to all ship captains
directing them to counsel their female sailors about the advantages
of NORPLANT, the under-the-skin birth control device.[12] 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>SEX TAKES PLACE AFLOAT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Two sailors aboard the <I>USS Eisenhower</I> were recently punished
for having sex, videotaping the event and then showing it to fellow
sailors.  The sailors were charged with adultery, since each of
them was married to someone else.  The incident shows that mixing
men and women in close quarters for extended periods can lead
to misconduct, and it has serious implications for morale.
<P>
The number of pregnancies aboard the USS Eisenhower, the first
combat vessel with female crewmembers, grew from five to 39 in
a couple months.  In all, 13 percent of the female crew became
pregnant.  By comparison, less than four percent of the male crewmembers
left the <I>Eisenhower</I> for medical reasons since April 1994.[13]
<P>
An active duty Naval officer with recent at-sea experience supervising
female sailors claims that every ship has &quot;large numbers
of pregnancies.&quot;  This officer alleges that advancement in
the Navy depends on supporting the &quot;vital program of women
at sea&quot; and he is &quot;not sure the Navy [has] thought through
the pregnancy issue.&quot;[14]
<P>
A seasoned chief petty officer who recently supervised women aboard
ship alleges that many women &quot;get pregnant to avoid deployment.&quot;
 He believes that many &quot;Generation X&quot; women are in the
Navy for financial gain, the education and to find a husband.
 Sex aboard ship is common.  As a supervisor who wouldn't tolerate
sexual liaisons among crewmembers,  he claims that his disapproving
female subordinates were very uncooperative with him due to his
lack of tolerance of their fraternization.
<P>
The chief alleges that many of his female subordinates were untrained
prior to a recent deployment because they had only been recently
reassigned to the crew.  They were replacing other females who
&quot;got pregnant at the last minute.&quot;  It is difficult
to replace women with men, because ships are now configured to
accommodate a specified number of billets for each sex. 
<P>
Apart from the immediate shipboard impact, the policy hurts family
members who stay ashore and worry about the sexual climate to
which their spouses are being subjected.  An officer's wife recently
wrote about sexual tensions in Haiti.  Two men shared a tent with
a female officer who &quot;made it known that she was open to
intimate relationships.&quot;  The male officer indicated the
situation made him &quot;uncomfortable and awkward&quot; and it
&quot;was to him professionally and personally&quot; distressing.
 He had recently married and his wife was pregnant with their
first child.[15] Military wives often worry about the prospects that
their husbands might be sexually preyed upon by women willing
to use sex for personal gain.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>AFFIRMATIVE ACTION COMES ABOARD</H3></CENTER>
<P>
There is growing anecdotal evidence that shows that female sailors
get special treatment.  Consider several incidents.
<P>
A female sailor aboard the <I>USS Eisenhower</I> was disciplined
for &quot;falling in love.&quot;  Her punishment was three days
on bread and water in a Navy brig.  Since the carrier has no female
jail, she was sent ashore to Rota, Spain via an Italian island,
Italy, Germany and finally Spain.  En route to Rota, she and her
two escorts shopped and dined their way for five days, all at
government expense.  She told the <I>Norfolk Virginian-Pilot and
Ledger-Star</I>, &quot;I was free to go.  We went out to eat,
to the shopping malls in Italy and we stayed in hotels.  It had
to be a huge expense.&quot;[16] Some &quot;punishment.&quot;
<P>
The 19-year-old claims she was the only female crewmember disciplined
for breaking the captain's no-dating policy and alleges other
women were found &quot;with their boyfriends kissing in closets
and other hideaways aboard ship.&quot;[17]
<P>
Tragedies which involve Navy women have also been handled in an
unusual fashion.  The fatal crash of an F-14A Tomcat fighter on
October 25, 1994 is revealing.  In an unprecedented move, the
Navy released Lieutenant Kara S. Hultgreen's training records
to the media and her mother, Sally Spears.  It also went to great
lengths to recover the aircraft from the ocean floor.  Finally,
it released a video showing Hultgreen's last carrier approach.
<P>
Although initial reports blamed a failed engine for the crash,
on March 14, 1995, the Mishap Investigation Report (MIR) contained
&quot;...repeated instances of pilot error.  It notes the role
of engine trouble but concludes that Hultgreen's flight-control
mistakes were the most critical factors [in the accident].&quot;[18]
 The MIR, written to exacting standards, is classified as &quot;privileged&quot;
and is used for improving the safety of future flights.
<P>
On March 7, 1995 a female Navy pilot called a live national radio
show from the deck of the <I>USS Abraham Lincoln</I>, the same
carrier to which Hultgreen was assigned.  This F-18 pilot called
to promote women in combat aircraft.  She explained that the &quot;women
in the military&quot; debate is about &quot;equal opportunity&quot;
and as far as she is concerned there is &quot;no problem.&quot;[19]
<P>
In August 1994, a male Navy pilot told his boss that he objected
to women serving in combat, but would follow orders.  He now faces
dismissal for failing to &quot;demonstrate leadership&quot; despite
having received outstanding efficiency reports.[20]
<P>
Another male officer alleges that women are receiving preferential
treatment for command and promotions.  One female officer was
selected to become a ship's executive officer after only three
years of sea duty.  The more seasoned male officer explained that
the standard has long been no less than six to eight years of
sea duty before eligibility for this coveted assignment.  He also
cited the example of a female commander who was excused for hitting
a sea buoy, an act which is normally a career killer.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CHARGES OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The 1991 Tailhook convention branded the Navy as a haven of sexual
harassers.  Even though much of the evidence is contradictory,
the Navy has suffered serious public relations damage.
<P>
In the wake of Tailhook, several key senior Navy leaders have
taken direct hits from women alleging sexual harassment.  Admiral
Stanley Arthur decided to drop a female lieutenant with poor flying
skills from helicopter aviation training.  The lieutenant claimed
that she had been eliminated from flight school because of &quot;retaliation&quot;
for filing a successful sexual harassment complaint.  The man
involved in the harassment charge was punished for making inappropriate
comments and has since left the Navy.
<P>
Adm. Arthur reviewed the lieutenant's record and found evidence
of poor aptitude and performance both before and after the harassment
incident.  He wrote: &quot;From this review I do not have sufficient
confidence that [the lieutenant] could safely and successfully
operate an aircraft in a dangerous and unforgiving operational
environment....I do not desire to see her or perhaps others die
because she could not perform at a level consistent with our standards.&quot;[21]
<P>
The admiral had been nominated to become Commander in Chief of
Naval Forces in the Pacific (CINCPAC).  After his decision, his
confirmation was procedurally shelved possibly because of threats
from congresswomen like Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-CO) who fought
the retirement status of outgoing Chief of Naval Operations Frank
B. Kelso II, who oversaw the Tailhook investigation.  The Navy
withdrew the Arthur nomination.
<P>
Tragically, Coast Guard Captain Ernest J. Blanchard IV took his
own life after learning of an investigation into remarks he allegedly
made at a dinner at the Coast Guard Academy on January 10, 1995.
 An officer who attended the dinner said, &quot;I heard the remark
that some of the things the speaker said would have been OK maybe
20 years ago....I guess they were jokes, off-color remarks, not
politically correct.  Some women in the humanities department
apparently complained about the comments.&quot;[22]
<P>
Blanchard, considered a rising star in the Coast Guard, wrote
a formal letter of apology to the &quot;offended&quot; woman,
but it was not accepted.  The female officer pressed her allegations.
 Blanchard offered to retire but permission was denied.  Friends
believe that he felt that his character was being assailed and
that he was being treated as an example by the Coast Guard.
<P>
In other instances, remarks by junior officers have met with charges
of sexual harassment.  For example, when a petty officer reported
that two of his subordinates were having a lesbian relationship,
the women responded by alleging sexual harassment.  The senior
chief was removed from the ship.
<P>
Another officer was removed for being a &quot;gender offender.&quot;
 The first words out of his boss's mouth were: &quot;You're guilty
of sexual harassment,&quot; a clear violation of the long tradition
of being held innocent until proven guilty.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Clinton Administration's decision to scuttle exemptions for
women and to embrace the feminization of the Navy has seriously
damaged readiness.  The 104th Congress should reverse the current
trend before irreparable harm is done to the U.S. Navy and the
defense posture of the nation.

<P>
John Cardinal O'Connor of New York has defined two conditions
-- and two conditions only -- that justify opposing the anti-illegitimacy
measures recently adopted by the House.  His opposition hinges,
first, on the &quot;virtual inevitability&quot; that a freeze
on benefits &quot;amounts to a programmed 'short-term' increase
in abortions&quot; and, second, on the lack of &quot;any hard
evidence&quot; to support the contention that reducing illegitimacy
will reduce abortions.[1]
<P>
The Cardinal's principled objections deserve an answer, and all
people of faith should be relieved by the fact that we do have
hard evidence to allay both of his concerns.  Given the weight
of evidence suggesting that abortions will not increase in the
short term and will in fact decrease in the long term, those who
defend the status quo on moral or empirical grounds must now bear
the burden of proof.  And those who have been both puzzled and
troubled by the rift in the pro-life ranks over this issue must
understand that the division springs not from a different understanding
of our moral responsibilities, but from a different degree of
reliance on the actual empirical record.
<P>
While it is far too premature to draw any decisive conclusions
from the welfare experiment in New Jersey, there is absolutely
no statistical indication as of yet that an increase in abortions
has occurred since the state's family cap took effect August 1,
1993.  In fact, the total number of Medicaid-funded abortions
in New Jersey declined from 13,629 in 1993 to 13,424 in 1994.[2]
<P>
Because Medicaid data is collected by date of payment, rather
than procurement, the raw numbers do contain some distortion.
 Yet any Medicaid-funded abortion occurring within approximately
the first year after implementation of the cap is included in
the current data set.  While the 1994 numbers are still subject
to some adjustment to reflect the most recent abortions for which
no claim has yet been filed, the existing margin between the totals
for 1993 and 1994 can accommodate the anticipated inflation without
threatening the indication that abortions have not surged upward
as feared.
<P>
Likewise, the number of privately funded abortions performed on
welfare mothers
 is expected to be too negligible to affect the finding that abortions
have not significantly increased (especially since the average
cost of an abortion in New Jersey in 1993 was equal to eight times
the $64 amount by which the new policy reduces the benefits package
each month).  Although no hard data is available to address the
question, Susan Tew of the Alan Guttmacher Institute commented
that &quot;it logically does not make sense to suggest that women
who are in severe financial straits and are eligible for a publicly
funded abortion would forgo those Medicaid dollars in lieu of
scarce private resources.&quot;  No data is available, she noted,
precisely because the possibility that welfare women forgo available
public funding for the abortions they choose to have is too remote
to merit the expenditure of research dollars.[3] 
<P>
The only other significant objection to the use of Medicaid data
-- the only data we have at present -- is that the population
includes approximately 57,000 women (ages 16-45) who are eligible
for Medicaid, but are not subject to the Family Development Program
(FDP) in New Jersey that included the family cap.  The presence
of such a sizeable group of women who are not subject to the new
welfare policy could conceivably mask an increase in abortions;
but the fact that the non-FDP population remained virtually unchanged
between 1993 and 1994 suggests that there is no hidden increase
lurking in the short-run data.
<P>
Anita Leone, executive director of an association that represents
all the publicly-funded abortion clinics in New Jersey, confirmed
in a recent interview: &quot;We know that abortions in New Jersey
are currently decreasing.  We just don't know why.&quot;  Since
the decline in the birth rate among welfare mothers in New Jersey
has been rather substantial since implementation of the family
cap (estimates range at least as high as 11.4 percent[4]), the fact
that an increase in abortions is not yet indicated is significant.
<P>
The anecdotal evidence collected by those who are on the frontlines
of welfare reform in New Jersey confirms the general pattern that
is beginning to emerge from the data.  Richard Traynor of the
Legal Center for Defense of Life in New Jersey and David Sciarra
of New Jersey Legal Services, who together filed a class-action
suit over the New Jersey family cap, both commented in telephone
interviews that the class was certified to include welfare mothers
who had aborted their babies -- but that neither one could locate
a woman who had actually aborted in the wake of the cap.
<P>
Instead, the only plaintiffs who mention abortion in their affidavits
explain that they consciously decided on moral grounds not to
terminate their pregnancies, despite increased economic pressures.
 One woman testified that she made an appointment at an abortion
clinic but ultimately &quot;became very upset about having an
abortion and decided that [she] could not go through with it.&quot;
 Another woman who already had two children and was carrying triplets
-- three times the pressure -- never even considered abortion.[5]
<P>
The decision to abort, the evidence suggests, is uniquely invulnerable
to rational economic incentives.  And welfare mothers are apparently
more inclined to consider &quot;non-rational&quot; factors than
any other population group.  Public opinion data collected by
the Family Research Council suggest that abortion is even more
morally repugnant to poor women;[6] and the fact that abortion rates
for teen welfare mothers are <I>lower</I> than national averages
for all teenage girls is a powerful indication that non-economic
factors determine the decision to carry a child to term.[7]
<P>
Many who now argue otherwise are precisely the ones who maintain
that the current benefits level is already far too low to cover
the costs associated with a new baby.  If so, it is illogical
to predict that a cap would have a sufficiently significant impact
on the &quot;affordability&quot; of another child to trigger such
a drastic measure as abortion.
<P>
State-by-state data from the 1980s demonstrates that small changes
in welfare payouts do not affect abortion rates in the short term;[8]
and Michael Schwartz of Life Advocacy Alliance has found in analyzing
more recent data that states with the highest average monthly
benefit for a family of three also tend to have the highest ratio
of abortions to live births.[9]
<P>
Not surprisingly, then, the only &quot;evidence&quot; the plaintiffs
could offer in the New Jersey suit was 55 letters from pro-life
activists expressing concern that freezing benefits might increase
abortions.  As of yet, there is nothing more concrete than their
concern itself to corroborate their claims; and pro-lifers who
are unconvinced by the hearsay -- including John Tomicki, past
president of New Jersey Right to Life -- have concluded that welfare
reform itself is a pro-life cause.
<P>
Contrary to Cardinal O'Connor's assertion, we do have compelling
statistical evidence to suggest that reducing illegitimacy will
reduce abortions.  Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation has
found an astronomically high correlation between abortion and
illegitimacy in a state-by-state analysis.  His study shows that
an increase of 100 in the number of illegitimate births per 10,000
women, in fact, results in an increase of 200 in the number of
abortions per 10,000 women.[10]
<P>
The vast majority of abortions are performed on unmarried women
-- and the proportion is growing.  To reduce abortions, we must
reduce the premarital sex and out-of-wedlock pregnancy that create
a perceived &quot;need&quot; for abortion.  Marriage affords the
best protection -- indeed, the only real hope -- for the children
of the poor.
<P>
In deference to that fact, John Paul II wrote in his most recent
encyclical <I>Evangelium Vitae</I> that &quot;[a] general <I>and
no less serious </I>responsibility [for abortion] lies with those
who have encouraged the spread of an attitude of sexual permissiveness
and a lack of esteem for motherhood, and with those who should
have ensured -- but did not -- effective family and social policies
in support of families.&quot;[11]
<P>
The Pope's teaching leaves ample room for inferring that a program
that undermines families and promotes sexual immorality as effectively
as our current welfare system does is equally responsible for
abortion as permissive abortion laws.  Those who countenance the
status quo in welfare countenance a system rife with abortion.
 And those who fight for welfare reform wage a war against abortion
that is no less morally valid than peaceful sit-ins, prayer vigils,
and reform of law.

Evelyn Hooker has been among the most influential figures in the
highly successful movement to convince the American people that
homosexuality is a &quot;normal variant&quot; of human sexual
behavior.  Her 1957 study, &quot;The Adjustment of the Male Overt
Homosexual&quot; (<I>Journal of Projective Techniques,</I> 1957,
21, 18-31) is the most frequently cited scientific source for
the argument that homosexuality is not a pathology, that homosexuals
are as free from mental disorder as heterosexuals.  
<P>
Such assertions have not only found their way into standard psychology
textbooks but have also provided a scientific basis for decisions
in major court cases involving the legality of state sodomy laws
and prohibitions against homosexual employment in certain state
and local agencies (e.g., schools, police departments).  Indeed,
when the American Psychiatric Association debated the issue of
homosexuality in 1973, Evelyn Hooker's work was Exhibit A for
those who wanted to remove homosexuality from the group's list
of mental disorders. 
<P>
For many commentators and activists, the Hooker study effectively
ended the debate over whether or not homosexuals were in any way
abnormal in their relationships with each other and with the community
at large.  Today many Americans have accepted the idea that homosexuality
is &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;healthy&quot; without realizing
that such an opinion is derived in large measure from a single
study -- one conducted by a UCLA professor whose previous laboratory
subjects had been rats.  
<P>
In all this extravagant homage to Hooker and her study, several
points have escaped her admirers, to say nothing of the federal
courts: 
<P>
1. In her 1957 report, Evelyn Hooker did not use a random sample
to test the stability of homosexuals, but allowed gay rights activists
to recruit those homosexuals most likely to illustrate her thesis
that homosexuality is not a pathology.  Individuals who proved
unstable were deleted from the final sample.
<P>
2. Hooker's published account of how she recruited heterosexual
subjects is not consistent with a more detailed later account.
<P>
3. Six subjects in her study, three from each group, had engaged
in both homosexual and heterosexual behavior beyond adolescence.
<P>
4. Hooker made several errors in her mathematical calculations
that raise doubts about her care and competence as a researcher.
<P>
5. Hooker did not attempt to prove that homosexuals were normal
in every way, nor does her study support the idea that homosexuals
as a group are just as stable as heterosexuals.
<P>
6. Hooker was relatively inexperienced in administering the Rorschach
test, and this inexperience may have led to mistakes in the administration
and evaluation of the Rorschach.
<P>
7. On the Thematic Apperception Test and the Make-A-Picture-Story
test -- which require subjects to make up fictional narratives
about depicted scenes -- the homosexuals could not refrain from
including homosexual fantasies in their imaginary accounts.  For
that reason, Hooker altered the nature of the study by no longer
asking the judges to use the TAT and MAPS in an attempt to determine
the sexual orientation of each of the 60 subjects, since the differences
were apparent from the narratives.
<P>
In order to understand fully the nature of the controversy over
Hooker's study, it is helpful to review its history.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>THE HISTORY OF THE HOOKER STUDY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Evelyn Hooker did not begin her research on homosexuals as a logical
development in her career as a psychologist or even out of a dispassionate
scientific curiosity. From all indications, she undertook the
study to prove that homosexuals could function as normal human
beings.  As she herself said, &quot;How could my hypothesis have
been anything else?  I'd seen these men and saw nothing psychopathological
in their behavior.&quot;[1]
<P>
&quot;These men&quot; were the many friends she'd made in the
Los Angeles homosexual community -- one of whom, Sam From, persuaded
her to undertake the investigation.  &quot;Now we have let you
see us as we are,&quot; he said to the UCLA professor.  &quot;It
is your scientific duty to do a study of people like us.&quot;[2]
 Despite the fact that she was a &quot;rat runner&quot; -- with
no clinical experience in the area of human behavior, she undertook
her study, which would become, along with the Kinsey report, a
prime weapon in the hands of the gay rights movement.
<P>
It is important to examine carefully the manner in which Hooker
planned and executed her research, which was funded by the federal
government's National Institute of Mental Health.  A number of
commentators have failed to read Hooker's own report carefully
or else have deliberately distorted her methods and findings for
their own purposes.  Here is just how she proceeded and what she
found.         
<P>
<CENTER><H3>SELECTION OF SUBJECTS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
First, to find her homosexual subjects, she enlisted the early
gay rights group Mattachine Society, which, as she put it in her
published report, &quot;has as its stated purpose the development
of a homosexual ethic....&quot;[3] Members of the Mattachine Society
volunteered for the study and also recruited their friends.  Hooker,
herself, created a &quot;control group&quot; of heterosexuals
for the experiment, despite the fact that on the standardized
tests she intended to use, norms had already been established.
<P>
In her 1957 report, Hooker offers this somewhat cryptic explanation
of heterosexual recruitment:
<P>
Because the heterosexuals were, for the most part, obtained from
community organizations which must remain anonymous, I cannot
describe further the way in which they were obtained.[4]
<P>
Years later, a <I>Los Angeles Times</I> reporter elicited from
Hooker a somewhat different explanation, one that is fairly explicit
in detail:
<P>
She canvassed the education secretaries of labor unions, thinking
that they would have liberal attitudes.  &quot;I was wrong,&quot;
she says; as soon as she explained the nature of the study, no
one wanted to participate...So Hooker took to collaring candidates
wherever she could find them, including a fireman who showed up
to inspect her home.  &quot;No man is safe on Saltair Street,&quot;
joked her husband.[5] 
<P>
She did not insist on a random sampling.  In fact, she deliberately
sought out only those subjects who seemed stable and &quot;normal&quot;
-- at least in their ability to adjust to their social environment.
 She defined the criteria for membership in the groups as follows:
<P>
In both groups subjects were eliminated who were in therapy at
the time.  If, in the preliminary screening, evidence of considerable
disturbance appeared, the individual was eliminated (5 heterosexuals;
5 homosexuals).[6]
<P>
As for the sexual proclivities of the participants, Hooker says
the following in her report:
<P>
I attempted to secure homosexuals who would be pure for homosexuality;
that is, without heterosexual experience.  With three exceptions
this is so.  These three subjects had not had more than three
heterosexual experiences, and they identified themselves as homosexual
in their patterns of desire and behavior.  The heterosexual group
is exclusively heterosexual beyond the adolescent period, with
three exceptions; these three had had a single homosexual experience
each.[7]
<P>
Originally, she chose 40 homosexual subjects and matched them
as closely as possible by age, IQ, and education with 40 heterosexual
subjects.  At some point, as noted parenthetically above, she
found five from each group too unbalanced to include in her study,
so apparently she dropped these ten and their matches in the opposite
groups -- for a total of 20 eliminated.  This winnowing process
reduced the size of the total pool from 80 to 60.
<P>
It is instructive to read her summary of these matchings and then
compare that summary to the chart containing the same information.
<P>
The homosexuals, and thus the heterosexuals, ranged in age from
25 to 50, with an average age of 34.5 for the homosexual group
and 36.6 for the heterosexual group.  The IQ range, as measured
by the Otis Self-Administering Tests of Mental Ability, was from
90 to 135, with an average for the homosexual group of 115.4 and
for the heterosexual group of 116.2.  In education the range was
from completion of grammar school to the equivalent of a master's
degree, with an average for the homosexual group of 13.9 years
and for the heterosexual group of 14.3.[8]
<P>
Turning to the table upon which she lists the age, IQ scores,
and education of all 60 subjects, a careful reader finds that
the figures neatly arranged in columns <I>contradict her summary</I>.
 While she says the age range for all subjects is 25-50, the chart
indicates that the youngest subject is 26 and the oldest 57. 
The figures on the table indicate an average age of 35 for the
homosexuals and 37 for the heterosexuals -- different averages
than the ones Hooker gives.
<P>
In her summary, she says the range of IQ scores is 90-135, but
the lowest IQ score on her chart is 91.  Despite this error, however,
her averages for both homosexuals and heterosexuals are consistent
with the chart.
<P>
On average years of education, she gives as a range the completion
of grammar school to the equivalent of a masters degree.  Here
her summary is at best imprecise, since the least amount of education
is 9 years -- past the junior high level and three years beyond
elementary school.  The highest educational level indicated on
the chart is 18 years, which is a year beyond the course requirement
for most master's programs.  Also, her average education for homosexuals,
based on the chart, should be 14.0 rather than 13.9.
<P>
These mathematical discrepancies are minor but disturbing.  If
all the averages had been incorrect, a generous reader might have
concluded that somehow she had printed the wrong chart -- a single
careless error.  But given the accuracy of <I>some</I> of her
calculations, it seems more likely she made several careless errors.
 A footnote on the first page of the Hooker report suggests that
the materials were rushed into print -- that, though she hesitated
to publish her paper, &quot;[i]n view of the importance of her
findings it seemed desirable to the editors that they be made
public....&quot;[9]  (In other words, she was saying something that
well-placed members of the profession wanted to hear.)      
<P>
To be sure, these figures are largely irrelevant to the final
conclusions of her study.  The averages of ages, IQ scores, and
amount of education lend only marginal credibility to the selection
process.  Yet the inaccuracies tell us something important about
Hooker's reliability as a researcher, the degree to which we can
trust her methodology.  As noted below, Hooker scored the Rorschach
test herself, despite the fact that she had had little previous
experience in this area.  Add to this inexperience a lack of mathematical
precision, and the study begins to pose genuine problems. 
<P>
At this point, two observations are in order concerning Hooker's
overall method of selecting her subjects.  First, in choosing
a small sample that is anything but random, Hooker has declined
to test the proposition that homosexuals and heterosexuals in
society are equally likely to be normal, well-adjusted human beings.
 As she, herself, says in the report, she is only interested in
&quot;whether homosexuality is <I>necessarily</I> [emphasis added]
a symptom of pathology.&quot;  To answer that question, she maintains,
&quot;All we need is a single case in which the answer is negative.&quot;[10]
 In other words, in this study she is concerned with finding at
least one homosexual who, after testing, doesn't fall into the
category of &quot;pathological.&quot;  This is why she has focused
on the healthiest possible cohort.    
<P>
But the limited scope of her study cuts two ways.  Knowing the
nature of the sample, no one could reasonably conclude from her
findings that homosexuals as a group are no more likely to be
mentally disturbed than heterosexuals.  Yet this is precisely
what many have concluded.  If one accepts the study as valid and
definitive, one can only conclude that some homosexuals are not
pathological <I>in their dealings with the world at large.</I>
  As Hooker herself observes, there is no evidence to conclude
that homosexuals are not pathological in their sexual activities.
<P>
A second point to note about Hooker's selection process is her
ease in recruiting homosexual subjects and her difficulty in recruiting
heterosexual subjects.  Indeed, her account in the study report
is evasive; and her later recollections suggest that she may have
shaded the truth initially in order to cover up problems she encountered
in recruiting the control group.         
<P>
This question becomes more pressing when one reads that in her
group of 30 heterosexual men, she still must include three who
have had homosexual experiences <I>in their adult lives</I> --
by no means a &quot;pure&quot; sample -- and we don't know how
many more had had homosexual experiences in adolescence.  No one
-- not even Kinsey -- would call this an unambiguously heterosexual
group.
<P>
From Hooker's own report -- and from a follow-up interview in
later years -- we see that homosexuals were not only eager to
participate, but indeed were the instigators of the study.  They
hoped that it would prove they were &quot;normal&quot; human beings;
so they scoured their own community to find just the right volunteers
to prove her limited hypothesis.  When analyzing the results of
the Hooker study, it's very important to remember who instigated
the project and the fact that the subjects were well aware of
its ultimate goal.  (In light of this fact, the performance of
homosexuals on two of the three tests, as discussed below, may
well indicate that homosexuality generates social behavior that
is obsessive, indeed all but uncontrollable -- certainly one indication
of pathology.) 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>THE TESTING OF THE SUBJECTS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
To prove her thesis, Hooker administered three standardized tests
to her 60 subjects -- the Rorschach Test, the Thematic Apperception
Test (TAT), and the Make-A-Picture-Story test (MAPS).  The Rorschach
test, as most people know, consists of a series of ink blots that
subjects are asked to interpret.  The Thematic Apperception Test
requires subjects to describe and make up stories about pictures
of people in various settings.  The MAPS test requires subjects
to arrange cut-out pictures and then make up a story about their
arrangement.   
<P>
Despite her lack of clinical experience in what is called &quot;projective
techniques,&quot; according to Hooker, she administered and scored
the Rorschach test herself.  After scoring the test and constructing
profiles, she placed the results in random order and passed them
along to two experts in Rorschach analysis.  Thus we have Hooker's
scored results analyzed by Drs. Klopfer and Meyer, with two tasks
in mind: first, to rate the subjects on &quot;overall adjustment&quot;
and second, to see if they could determine which were the homosexuals
and which were the heterosexuals.
<P>
On the task of determining overall adjustment (i.e., social stability),
the judges differed sharply in some respects but agreed in others.
 For example, Judge &quot;A&quot; rated 15 of the 60 as &quot;top&quot;
in stability, while Judge &quot;B&quot; rated only 4 as &quot;top.&quot;
 The other ratings revealed greater agreement. However, more homosexuals
than heterosexuals ranked in the two &quot;top&quot; groupings
and more heterosexuals than homosexuals ranked in the two &quot;bottom&quot;
groupings.
<P>
When assigned the task of choosing between the homosexual and
heterosexual subjects, Judge &quot;A&quot; correctly identified
17 of the 30 pairs and Judge &quot;B&quot; 18 of the 30.  An ideal
random selection would have identified 15 out of 30, though Hooker
is technically correct in saying that, in such a small sample,
the results indicate that &quot;neither judge was able to do better
than chance.&quot;[11]
<P>
Critics of Hooker's Rorschach results make at least two points.
 First, they question her ability to administer and score the
test.  As an animal researcher until the time she undertook this
project, she obviously had logged comparatively little experience
in administering Rorschachs, a delicate and highly complicated
task in which the clinician gently and obliquely elicits spontaneous
responses.  Some authorities in the field maintain that, under
ideal circumstances, a more qualified expert would have explored
many avenues Hooker failed to note and would have found out many
things Hooker missed -- including indications of the pathology
of the homosexuals.
<P>
A second criticism of her methodology is the lack of &quot;blindness&quot;
in the administration of the Rorschach.  Ideally, given the nature
of the results sought, the test should have been administered
under circumstances in which both interviewer and subject were
unaware of the purpose of the test.  In the case of the Hooker
study, both she and her subjects knew what she was striving to
prove -- and both she and the homosexuals had a vested interest
in proving the hypothesis that homosexuals were not necessarily
pathological.
<P>
Can Rorschach subjects tailor their answers to desired ends? 
Absolutely, say some Rorschach experts.  One example of such a
phenomenon in &quot;projective techniques&quot; is called the
&quot;Rosenthal Effect,&quot; in which a subject generates the
results he or she believes the researcher wants.  In this particular
case, both the researcher (Hooker) and her homosexual subjects
had a compelling reason to produce these results.
<P>
Perhaps the most significant implications of Hooker's study came
from the MAPS and TAT results, which were analyzed by a single
judge.  Here is Hooker's own account:
<P>
The problem of identifying the homosexual protocol from this
material was essentially a much easier one than that encountered
with the Rorschach, since few homosexuals failed to give open
[sic] homosexual stories on at least one picture.  The second
task given the Rorschach judges, of distinguishing the homosexual
from the heterosexual records when they were presented in matched
pairs, was therefore omitted.[12]
<P>
Note that the identity of the homosexuals was so obvious in these
tests that Hooker did not even ask the judge to distinguish between
homosexual and heterosexual.  Simply put, the homosexuals gave
themselves away on tests less dependent than the Rorschach on
the training and experience of the examiner.  Despite the fact
that they knew the purpose of this test was to prove their own
stability, normalcy, and lack of differentiation from heterosexuals,
they still did not refrain from indulging themselves in homosexual
fantasies, thereby exposing their sexual appetites.  It is difficult
not to conclude that in verbalizing such fantasies, they were
exhibiting the obsessive nature of homosexuality, the difficulty
of homosexuals to control their desire, even when their reputation
in the psychiatric community was at stake.
<P>
As one research analyst puts it:
<P>
So Hooker's study suggests that sexual fantasies among homosexuals
are irrepressible, so much so that such people cannot always see
ordinary situations and relations as devoid of sexual content,
but must, on occasion, interject sexual significance where it
does not exist or, at the very least, need not exist.  Following
the logical conclusions of this experiment, we are compelled to
conclude that there is something substantively different about
the way homosexuals and heterosexuals look at the world.[13]
<P>
In evaluating the MAPS and TAT results for stability, the single
judge assigned &quot;top&quot; scores to no one; 9 homosexuals
and 7 heterosexuals were rated &quot;next to top&quot;; 15 homosexuals
and 19 heterosexuals were ranked &quot;average&quot;; 6 homosexuals
and 3 heterosexuals were rated &quot;next to bottom&quot;; and
no homosexuals and 1 heterosexual were ranked at the &quot;bottom.&quot;
 (Again, critics say that the absence of &quot;blindness&quot;
raises the possibility that the Rosenthal Effect was again operative
in the evaluation process, since the judge knew what Hooker was
seeking.)
<P>
<CENTER><H3>SUMMARY OF RESULTS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The remainder of her study is a highly selective summary of comments
by judges, all of which support her thesis that the two groups
are, in effect, indistinguishable in terms of &quot;overall adjustment.&quot;
 In her own evaluation of the results, Hooker -- aware of the
degree to which she is challenging leading authorities in the
field -- offers a set of &quot;admissions&quot; about the limitations
of her study.  In this section she concedes the possibility that
homosexuals are indeed pathological, a point overlooked by most
of her admirers.
<P><UL>
<LI>She speculates that the psychological defect of homosexuals
may lie &quot;in a weakness of ego-function and control and that
this cannot be adequately diagnosed from projective test protocols.
 As one psychiatrist puts it, the material produced in the Rorschach
is like that produced on the analytic couch.  Two men may produce
very similar material on the couch, but the difference between
them is that one -- the normal -- gets up at the end of the hour
and resumes his normal functioning, while the other does not.&quot;[14]
<P>
<LI>She also admits that the pathology of homosexuality may only
occur &quot;in an erotic situation and that the homosexual can
function well in non-erotic situations such as the Rorschach,
TAT, and MAPS.  Thus, one could defend the hypothesis that homosexuality
is symptomatic of pathology, but that the pathology is confined
to one sector of behavior, namely, the sexual.&quot;[15] (She seems
to have disproved this proposition by her own study, since the
homosexuals were unable to control their sexual fantasies, even
in a &quot;non-erotic situation&quot; such as taking the MAPS
and TAT.)
<P>
<LI>During Hooker's research, she took the life histories of her
subjects; and though she didn't include an analysis of these materials
in her study, she did indicate that when she eventually published
her results, &quot;the life history data from the two groups will
differ:  namely, in the love relationships.  Comparisons between
the number and duration of love relationships, cruising patterns,
and degree of satisfaction with sexual pattern and the love partner
will certainly show clear-cut differences.&quot;[16]
</UL>
Hooker never published the summary of these histories, though
in a fairly recent interview with writer-researcher Edward Eichel,
she said she still hoped to do so after 35 years.  However, she
undoubtedly found in these personal histories what most other
researchers have found:  a substantially greater number of sexual
partners among homosexuals than heterosexuals and a significantly
shorter duration in relationships.  These findings, if published,
could well have cast further doubts on the stability and normalcy
of homosexuals.
<P>
It is significant to note that Hooker's stated reservations seldom,
if ever, find their way into the summaries of her work -- summaries
that are now <I>de rigeur</I> in legal and scholarly discussions
of homosexuality.  Her 1957 report has, like a folk tale, become
simpler and purer in the constant retelling.  Instead of a complicated
account filled with the predictable complexity of life, we now
have only Beauty and the Beast.     
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CITATIONS AND  USES OF THE HOOKER STUDY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Perhaps as important as the Hooker 1957 research itself is the
use that others have made of her findings.  Not only has this
single study with only 60 subjects been cited repeatedly by prominent
psychiatrists, social critics, and gay activists; but such summaries
have also been accepted as part of the expert testimony in high-profile
court cases nationwide.
<P>
Curiously, many of those who cite the study not only incorrectly
summarize its content but do so in remarkably similar fashion.
 It's as if one commentator misread Hooker and all the rest derived
their knowledge from that single erroneous commentary.  Here are
several examples:     
<P><UL>
<LI>In the <I>Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry</I>, Dr. Judd
Marmor, a driving force in the American Psychiatric Association's
decision to drop homosexuality from its manual of disorders, has
written this summary of Hooker's research: &quot;Hooker (1957)
conducted a cooperative study of 30 male homosexuals and 30 male
heterosexuals who were matched for age, I.Q., and education. 
The homosexuals were all rated 6 and the heterosexuals 0 on the
Kinsey scale.  None of the subjects was in therapy.  Two judges
independently, without prior knowledge of which subjects were
which, reviewed the Rorschach protocols, Thematic Apperception
Tests, and Make-a-Picture-Story responses, and tried to distinguish
the homosexuals from the heterosexuals, but they were unable to
do so.&quot;[17]
<P><UL>
<LI>Marmor repeated this very passage when he submitted an affidavit
in <I>Morales v. Texas</I>, a case heard before a state court
in Texas.
<P>
<LI>Dr. Gregory Herek supported Marmor's testimony in <I>Morales
v. Texas</I>, saying under oath: &quot;The classic study in this
case was conducted by Hooker (1957).  She administered the Rorschach,
Thematic Apperception Test, and Make-A-Picture-Story Test...When
asked to assess which protocols were obtained from homosexuals,
the experts were unable to distinguish respondents' sexual orientation
at a level better than chance.&quot;[18]
<P>
<LI>In a 1990 article on Hooker, <I>Los Angeles Times</I> reporter
Bruce Shenitz described the experiment in precisely the same way:
 &quot;On all three tests, two-thirds of the heterosexuals and
homosexuals were assigned a rating of 3 (average) or better. 
Next, the judges were presented with pairs of tests and asked
to distinguish between heterosexuals and homosexual.  They were
able to do so no more accurately than if they were flipping a
coin.&quot;[19]
</UL></UL>
This striking agreement among scientific experts and the working
press is remarkable, especially when one realizes that all of
these accounts <I>are untrue</I>.  Marmor's version is particularly
faulty.  Indeed, the brief passage quoted above contains five
demonstrable errors of fact.
<P>
1.  &quot;The homosexuals were all rated 6 and the heterosexuals
0 on the Kinsey scale.&quot;  In the first place, in her report
Hooker makes no reference whatsoever to the Kinsey scale.  In
the second place, she gives evidence in her narrative to contradict
Marmor's generalization.  Three heterosexuals reported homosexual
contact after adolescence and three homosexuals reported heterosexual
behavior.  Kinsey described his &quot;0&quot; rating as &quot;[e]xclusively
heterosexual with no homosexual&quot; and his &quot;6&quot; rating
as &quot;[e]xclusively homosexual.&quot;
<P>
2. There were three judges involved rather than two, as Marmor
reports.
<P>
3. Dr. Marmor reports that the judges reviewed all three tests
when, in fact, two judges reviewed the Rorschach and one judge
reviewed the MAPS and TAT.
<P>
4. Dr. Marmor states that the judges reviewed the MAPS and the
TAT, as well as the Rorschach, in an attempt to distinguish between
heterosexual and homosexual subjects when, in fact, no judge was
asked to make this distinction for the MAPS and TAT because Hooker
knew the homosexuals had &quot;outed&quot; themselves.  
<P>
5. Contrary to what Marmor states, the MAPS and TAT did indeed
reveal the sexual orientation of the homosexuals.  
<P>
Both Herek and Shenitz make some of the same errors Marmor makes.
<P>
1. They suggest that more than one judge reviewed all test results.
<P>
2. They also state that after looking at the results of all three
tests, the &quot;experts&quot; or &quot;judges&quot; were unable
to distinguish between homosexual and heterosexual subjects.
<P>
Shenitz is no more than a newspaper reporter, but in <I>Morales
v. Texas</I>, Marmor and Herek were testifying as expert scientific
witnesses before a judge -- Marmor as former president of the
American Psychiatric Association.  It is ironic that while the
Morales judge accepted the testimony of Marmor and Herek without
question, he ignored the research of Paul Cameron, who gives a
careful and precise summary of the Hooker study in his volume
<I>The Gay Nineties: What the Empirical Evidence Reveals About
Homosexuality</I>.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
This unquestioning acceptance of &quot;authorities&quot; on the
basis of professional reputation or political correctness threatens
the integrity of our legal system.  Judges must take greater responsibility
for assessing the soundness and accuracy of testimony by so-called
experts; yet, paradoxically, such a task is manifestly beyond
the competence of the court.  This dilemma is the consequence
of the politicizing of the scientific community over the past
several decades, particularly in questions of sexuality.  The
recent exposure of Kinsey's errors indicates just how long researchers
have been careless or deliberately misleading in approaching sexual
questions.  And the widespread acclamation of recent, flawed studies
&quot;proving&quot; that homosexuality is inherited genetically
is evidence that the problem has only worsened over the years.

<P>
The 1995 federal appropriation bills which were approved by the
last Congress are filled with duplication, political favoritism,
social agendas, and questionable grants.  The alarming misuse
of taxpayer money should encourage citizens to demand more accountability.
<P>
Consider some government spending already approved for 1995:
<P>
<UL><LI> The Corporation for Public Broadcasting may pay a single individual
$438,000 for a once-a-week, 30-minute TV appearance.[1]
<P>
<LI>Federally financed Howard University gets $5.5 million to prepare
practicing attorneys to do pro bono work in Washington, DC.
<P>
<LI>NIH will spend $2.5 million to build playgrounds for monkeys.
<P>
<LI>DOT will spend $400,000 to help Russians build roads.
<P>
<LI>The Pentagon will spend $18 million for new homes at an Army
base that is losing one third of its existing personnel.
<P>
<LI>The State Department will give Russians $15 million for &quot;family
planning.&quot;
<P>
<LI>The State Department will spend $750,000 to study tropical bird
migration.
<P>
<LI>The EPA will spend $250,000 to control zebra mussels in the
City of Chicago.
<P>
<LI>The EPA will spend $70,000 to study a European fish in Lake
Superior.
<P>
<LI>HUD will spend $53 million for a sewage plant in Mexico.
<P>
<LI>The Forest Service will spend $635,000 to build a visitor center
on a remote and inaccessible by road peninsula on Alaska's panhandle.
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>DETAILS FROM 13 APPROPRIATION BILLS</h3></CENTER>
<P>
<B>1. Foreign aid in non-foreign bills</B>:  The appropriations
bill for &quot;The ForeignOperations, Export Financing, and Related Programs for the Fiscal
Year Ending September 30, 1995&quot; includes funding for most
foreign aid programs.  Foreign aid, however, can be found in other
bills.  
<P><UL>
<LI>The Federal Highway Administration was given $400,000 to provide
technical assistance to Russia.[2] 
<P>
<LI>The Department for Housing and Urban Development (HUD) was given
$52.5 million to finance the construction of a waste treatment
plant in Tijuana, Mexico.[3]  HUD is funding a second wastewater
facility near Micicali, Mexico for $47.5 million.[4] (Congress also
appropriated $1 million through the International Boundary and
Water Commission to reimburse the City of San Diego for treatment
of Tijuana sewage.[5]) 
<P>
<LI>Funding for the Smithsonian Institution includes a $50,000 grant
to the Mpala Center, Kenya for facility and equipment purchases.[6]
</UL>
<B>2. Suspect foreign aid</B>.  
<P><UL>
<LI>The State Department will provide $15 million for &quot;family
planning&quot; to Russia in 1995.[7]
<P>
<LI>It will give $50 million to the United Nation Population Fund
(UNPF) with the intention that none of this money will be used
to fund abortions in China.[8] The UNPF is expected to give $7 million
for &quot;voluntary family planning programs&quot; in China.[9]
<P>
<LI>The State Department will grant $750,000 to the Fish and Wildlife
Foundation to study neotropical migratory bird conservation.[10]
</UL>
<B>3. Duplication of programs</B>.  Our government should
look to eliminate redundancy.  Consider:
<P><UL>
<LI>The Treasury Department's plan to build a training facility
near Tuscon, Arizona.  There will be a dormitory, a dining facility
and $2.9 million in firearm ranges.[11] Just outside of Tuscon is
the Army's Fort Huachuca, which has many modern firearm ranges.
 Treasury should arrange with the Army to use existing ranges
rather than building duplicate firing facilities.  After all,
the FBI Academy's entire campus is located on Quantico Marine
Base in Virginia where it has joint use of all ranges.
<P>
<LI>The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) was appropriated
$175,000 for a special purpose grant to be given to Domestic Violence
Prevention, Inc. in Bowie County, Texas.[12] Why is housing money
used for this project when the 1994 crime bill authorizes $324
million for the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act?[13]
The crime bill also has $10 million for nonprofit organizations
to establish projects that coordinate intervention and prevention
of domestic violence, and authorizes $30 million for rural domestic
violence and child abuse enforcement.
<P>
<LI>The Department of Interior received $800,000 to monitor salmon
on Alaska's Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers.[14] The National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will spend another $700,000
to collect information on salmon in the Yukon River as well.[15]
NOAA collects information on salmon at other locations as well.
<P>
<LI>The Small Business Administration is directed to grant $3.25
million for three incubator facilities.[16]
<P>
<LI>The Justice Department is appropriated $29 million for &quot;Drug
Courts&quot; which is a program that provides drug treatment during
and after incarceration for non-violent offenders.[17] This replicates
ongoing programs both inside prisons and in many communities.
<P>
<LI>The National Science Foundation was appropriated $2 million
to establish in 1995 an interdisciplinary center to support research
on violence.[18] The 1994 crime bill authorizes many programs to
research violence:[19]
<P><UL>
<LI>Title IV-Violence Against Women Act of 1994 requires the Attorney
General to study campus sexual assaults, the &quot;battered women's
syndrome,&quot; the abusive spouse, and domestic violence.[20]
<P>
<LI>Title III-Crime Prevention includes research grants to investigate
juvenile violence, drug use, and gang violence.[21]
<P>
<LI>Virtually every section of the crime bill requires at least
one federal agency to either study or research special aspects
of violence.[22]
</UL><P>
<LI>HUD will award housing money for six substance abuse programs
and eight crime prevention programs.[23] The 1994 crime bill includes
duplicate grant programs.
<P>
<LI>Congress has already appropriated $20.4 million for federal
support of the 1995 Special Olympics in New Haven, Connecticut
and both the XXVI Olympiad and the X Paralympiad in Atlanta in
1996.[24] The GSA and HUD will contribute $3 million to the X Paralympiad.
 (The Paralympiad was established in 1960 to create awareness
of athletes with physical disabilities.)  The X Paralympiad will
take place in Atlanta August 16-17, just after the Olympic Games.
 Some 4,000 athletes representing 110 countries are expected to
participate.  HUD's contribution goes to assist disabled veterans
to participate.
<P>
<LI>Congress appropriated $5.6 million for the taxpayer funded District
of Columbia School of Law ignoring Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly's
recommendation to close the school.  Two of the best law schools
in the nation are in Washington, D.C. - Georgetown University
and American University and another is in nearby Baltimore.  Additionally,
the appropriation bill lists the other reasons to close the school:
it must dramatically expand its library before it can earn full
accreditation; it must increase faculty salaries and other staff
and student services; and the school needs a permanent facility
of at least 125,000 square feet.[25]
</UL>
<B>4. Spending to remember former Congressional Leaders.</B>
<P><UL>
<LI>The National Historical Publications and Records Commission
is giving $2 million to the Thomas P. &quot;Tip&quot; O'Neill,
Jr. Library at Boston College.[26] The money will be used to organize
Mr. O'Neill's personal papers.  
<P>
<LI>Two million dollars was also granted to the Robert H. and Corinne
W. Michel Congressional Education Fund.[27]  Michel was for many years
the House minority leader.  
<P>
<LI>The Merit Systems Protection Board granted $10 million to the
Morris K. Udall Scholarship and Excellence in National Environmental
Policy Foundation.[28] Udall was a liberal congressman and environmentalist
from Arizona.
</UL>
<B>5. Other questionable expenditures.</B>  
<P><UL>
<LI>The Army recently announced that the 1st Infantry Division headquartered
at Fort Riley, Kansas will be removed from the force.  This means
approximately 5,600 soldiers or a third of the post's population
will leave.  Meanwhile, Congress has appropriated $12.6 million
to build 126 new homes at Fort Riley.[29]
<P>
<LI>The 6th Infantry Division headquartered at Fort Wainwright,
Alaska was deactivated in July, 1994.  Cuts in the Army's presence
in Alaska will be felt at both Fort Wainwright and Fort Richardson
which is near Anchorage.  Yet, Congress appropriated $5 million
to build 72 new homes at Fort Richardson and $66 million to replace
the nearby and jointly used Elmendorf Air Force Base hospital.[30]
<P>
<LI>The Department of Agriculture's Forest Service will spend $635,000
to build a visitor center at Ketchikan, Alaska.  Ketchikan is
located on a remote peninsula reachable only by boat and small
plane.  Ketchikan county has a population of 14,000 inhabitants
scattered among numerous small villages.  The Department also
gave $500,000 to Alaska because &quot;many timber mills have closed.&quot;[31]
<P>
<LI>The National Institutes of Health, National Center for Research
Resources, was directed by the conference committee to reserve
$2.5 million for playgrounds for monkeys used in research.[32]
<P>
<LI>The federal government helps to fund Washington, D.C.'s Howard
University.  Part of the University's 1995 appropriations ($5.5
million) are for the creation of a Law School Clinical Center
to provide legal assistance to supplement the Legal Services Corporation
and to conduct training for practicing attorneys to perform pro
bono (free) services.[33]
</UL>
<B>6. Did you know?</B>  Here are some of the various
and sundry federal spending programs.
<P><UL>
<LI>$46 million to build and operate military child development
centers, including one in Germany and one in Great Britain.[34] These
federally subsidized centers are part of a growing network of
child care facilities that include every military activity worldwide.
<P>
<LI>$45 million will be spent by the Library of Congress for books
for blind and physically handicapped people.[35]
<P>
<LI>The Department of Transportation will give $26 million for employee
bonuses and cash awards.[36]
<P>
<LI>$2.7 million to the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation.[37]
 This 34 person organization oversees construction projects along
Washington's Pennsylvania Avenue.
<P>
<LI>$27 million annual operating expenses for the U.S. Holocaust
Memorial Council, which is a private organization that oversees
the Holocaust Museum.[38] This relatively small but popular museum
was first opened to the public two years ago.  It was built with
$168 million in private donations raised in just four years.[39]
The Council continues to receive donations from many national
and local organizations.
<P>
<LI>Child Nutrition Programs include $500,000 in state grants for
special dietary needs of children with disabilities.[40]
<P>
<LI>$7 million for the private organization American Printing House
for the Blind.[41]
<P>
<LI>The State Department oversees a $533 million United Nations
peacekeeping appropriation.  This money can be spent with one
stipulation: that American manufacturers and suppliers are given
an &quot;equal&quot; opportunity to provide equipment, services,
and materials to the United Nations peacekeepers.[42] The Senate
amended this appropriation to transfer $350 million to unspecified
&quot;International Organizations&quot; for peacekeeping activities.[43]
<P>
<LI>HUD will grant the City of Chicago $250,000 to control zebra
mussels which originally came from the Black Sea area of Europe.[44]
 The Department of Interior will continue to study zebra mussels
at St. Croix, Virgin Islands.[45] The National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration was appropriated $3.7 million to research zebra
mussels.[46] If the zebra mussel is truly endangering our oceans
and lakes, then a more focused effort should be undertaken.
</UL>
<B>7. Legislating inside appropriation bills.</B>  Five
appropriation bills contain social legislation.  
<P><UL>
<LI>The Architect of the Capitol is directed to hire a &quot;diverse
labor force.&quot;[47] This means hiring quotas.
<P>
<LI>The National Science Foundation is directed to award at least
20 percent of all grants to small colleges and universities that
consist of &quot;predominantly underrepresented groups&quot; in
science and technology.[48]
<P>
<LI>When hiring investigators the John F. Kennedy Assassination
Records Review Board is directed to give preferential treatment
to former Office of Personnel Management employees.[49]
<P>
<LI>The Office of Personnel Management is encouraged to promote
&quot;diversity.&quot;  OPM's definition of &quot;diversity&quot;
includes people of different sexual orientation.[50]
<P>
<LI>The appropriation bill for the Department of Agriculture deletes
Senate language aimed at ending the use of taxpayer funds to promote
homosexuality.[51]
<P>
<LI>Health and Human Services is directed to increase quotas for
black nurses nationally.[52]
<P>
<LI>The Federal Bureau of Investigation was appropriated funds to
restore special agents &quot;eliminated in prior years associated
with background investigations.&quot;[53] A former marker for elimination
based on a background investigation was identifying the candidate
as a homosexual.  The FBI Academy has started training for homosexuals
previously rejected.
</UL>
<B>8. Please explain these appropriations.</B>  Many programs
are funded without adequate explanation.  
<P><UL>
<LI>The Department of Education is awarding $4 million to the Mary
McLeod Bethune Memorial Fine Arts Center on the campus of Bethune
Cookman College in Daytona Beach, Florida.[54] The facility will
allow students to be trained for the fields of entertainment and
hotel management.[55]
<P>
<LI>The U.S. Institute of Peace gets $11.5 million.[56] The ten year
old institute has received $76 million in federal grants.  In
1991 it shifted from discussing peace to teaching conflict resolution
in America's classrooms.  There are more than 300 violence-prevention
programs and 100 conflict resolution curricula available to America's
28,000 high schools and 78,000 grade schools.[57] The 1994 crime
bill contains many grants for anti-violence programs.  
<P>
<LI>The Bureau of Mines is directed to do &quot;essential Arctic
research&quot; in Anchorage, Alaska.[58]  Anchorage is 400 miles south
of the Arctic Circle and has no arctic characteristics like permafrost.
 Why not conduct the research nearer the Arctic Circle, perhaps
at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks?
<P>
<LI>The National Telecommunications and Information Administration
is appropriated $1.5 million for the Pan-Pacific Educational and
Cultural Experiments by Satellite Program.[59]
<P>
<LI>Washington, D.C. received $720 million from the federal government
for public education.  The appropriation bill states, &quot;the
Board of Education has overspent its appropriation for personal
services by millions of dollars while underspending its appropriation
for other-than-personal-services by an equal amount.  The chronic
recurrence of such an imbalance suggests that the Board of Education
habitually submits budgets to the Congress that the Board knows
to be unrealistic and that the Board intends to disregard.&quot;[60]
<P>
<LI>The Department of Housing and Urban Development will award 261
special purpose grants worth $291 million.[61] These include:
<P><UL>
<LI>$450,000 to construct the Center for Political Participation
at the University of Maryland.[62] The Center &quot;is the first
academically-sanctioned program in the country to support young
leaders seeking elective office.&quot;[63] The advisory board includes
actress Morgan Fairchild, Congressman Steny Hoyer, Congresswoman
Connie Morella, <I>ABC News'</I> Sheila Kast, and the wife of
Maryland governor Parris Glendening.[64]
<P>
<LI>$500,000 to the Maine College of Art for renovations to a Portland
building.[65]
<P>
<LI>$1 million to develop the Center for Pacific Rim Studies in
San Francisco.[66] The Center will do research on competition and
offer training for professionals.  It is focused on trade development,
including foreign language and culture, legal systems, commercial
practices and data links.[67]
<P>
<LI>$6.5 million for the Points of Light Foundation.[68] The <I>Los
Angeles Times</I> found that the Foundation in its first four
years spent $22 million on administrative expenses and $4 million
on grants to service organizations.  Expenses included $1.4 million
for a kickoff celebration and more than $108,000 paid to the Hill
and Knowlton public relations firm to promote the party, as well
as a $160,000 salary for its top executive.  In the first four
years, it received $26 million from the government.[69]
<P>
<LI>$500,000 for the National Invention Resource Center in the
City of Akron, Ohio.[70] The Center is part of the nonprofit Inventure
Place which opens July, 1995.
<P>
<LI>$70,000 to study the European Ruffe in Lake Superior.[71] The
Ruffe was introduced in 1986 to Duluth Harbor which is on Lake
Superior.  The Ruffe now makes up 65 percent of the harbor's fish
population.  Why is federal housing money being used to study
the spread of this fish?  Possibly some of the $450,000 appropriated
for the Great Lakes Fishery Commission could be used to study
the Ruffe.[72]
<P>
<LI>$750,000 for a center to coordinate academic training for physical
therapists at the Veterans' Administration hospitals in Brooklyn,
NY.[73]
<P>
<LI>$2.5 million for Project Social Care MB, Inc. to serve elderly
Holocaust survivors in Brooklyn, NY.[74] There are about 2,000 Holocaust
survivors in the greater New York metro area.  Another organization,
Selfhelp Community Services, has a $51 million annual budget and
has the prime focus on helping survivors.[75]
<P>
<LI>$250,000 for port modernization at Davisville, Rhode Island.[76]
<P>
<LI>$300,000 to expand the science and mathematics complex at the
University of South Carolina.[77]
<P>
<LI>$1.2 million for the Fire Safe Cigarette Act.[78] These funds
go to the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the National
Institute of Standards and Technology to measure the cigarette's
ignition propensity.[79]
<P>
<LI>HUD special purpose grants also fund: 5 child care centers,
the restoration of 5 theaters/museums, restoring or building 5
libraries, running a summer camp program, and building a bicentennial
and media activities center for a city.[80]
</UL></UL>
<B>9. AIDS money scattered among bills.</B>  Most AIDS
money is found in the appropriations for HHS, but AIDS money is
in other bills as well.
<P><UL>
<LI>The Department of Agriculture will grant Indiana $250,000 to
study HIV/STD prevention in rural areas.[81]
<P>
<LI>The Pentagon is being given $33 million to study AIDS.[82]
<P>
<LI>HUD is appropriated $186 million for housing people with AIDS.[83]
 HUD also is awarding special purpose grants worth $4.3 million
for other HIV housing facilities.[84]
</UL>
<B>10. Politics and agriculture appropriations.</B>  The
1995 agriculture appropriations appear to be based more on politics
than merit.  The top three states to receive agriculture grants
earmarked by state were Arkansas, Iowa and Mississippi.[85] Arkansas
received $17.7 million, Iowa received $11.9 million, and Mississippi
received $10.45 million.
<P>
Senators from these states were on the conference committee for
appropriations.  Additionally, President Clinton is from Arkansas
and former Secretary of Agriculture Mike Epsy is from Mississippi.
<P>
The U.S. Department of Commerce reports that the highest net farm
income for 1991 came from California which ranked seventh in discretionary
agriculture grants.  Mississippi ranked 21 in net income and Arkansas
was ninth.[86] But Arkansas received almost 300 percent more discretionary
grant money than California, the highest farm income state.  Arkansas
grants included:
<P><UL>
<LI>$462,000 for a National Center for Agricultural Law Research
and Information at the Leflar School of Law in Fayetteville, Arkansas.[87]
<P>
<LI>$1.2 million for a new agriculture building and $946,000 for
an Alternative Pest Control Center at the University of Arkansas.[88]
<P>
<LI>$4.8 million for the Rice Germplasm Center, Stuttgard, Arkansas.[89]
<P>
<LI>$1.1 million for the Arkansas Children's Hospital.[90]
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Taxpayers should demand that the 104th Congress review and rescind
appropriations that waste money or promote a political agenda.

<H2>THE DOLLARS AND SENSE<br>
OF CUTTING GOVERNMENT</H2>

<P>
American families must balance expenses with income.  When this
fails, they delay clothing purchases or visits to the dentist.
  Such decisions are difficult,  but the alternative of  mounting
debt is too risky.  These hard-working taxpayers likewise expect
the federal government to keep its fiscal house in order by balancing
expenses with income.
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives Budget Committee is beginning
the process of balancing  the national budget.  The Committee
proposes a balanced budget by the year 2002, but to get there
will require a lot of  belt tightening.   
<P>
Their proposed budget includes many needed cuts.  They propose
to terminate, privatize, or convert to block grants three Cabinet
departments, 284 programs, 69 commissions, 13 agencies, and three
commercial activities.[1]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>DEPARTMENTS TO BE ELIMINATED (3)</CENTER></H3>
<P>
The Department of Energy was created in 1977 by President Jimmy
Carter in response to the energy crisis of the early 1970s.  
The 20,213-employee agency promotes energy conservation, controls
federal supplies of power, and develops alternative sources of
energy.   However, 85 percent of DoE's budget is spent on activities
that are not energy related.[2]
<P>
The Department of Education was established in 1979 by President
Carter to expand the federal role in education.  The Department's
budget has doubled while student performance has declined.   According
to former Secretary of Education William Bennett, more than 90
percent of the students entering U.S. colleges today would not
be admitted to post-secondary education anywhere else in the world.[3]
 In fact, only a small part of federal education spending reaches
American classrooms.  Most of the Department's current functions
of technical assistance and information can be transferred to
the states or other federal agencies.
<P>
The Department of Commerce was created in 1903 and spends $3.6
billion per year on more than 100 programs of which three-fourths
are duplicated by other federal agencies.  More than half of the
Department's budget and a third of its employees staff the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.[4] This organization would
become an independent agency.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>AGENCIES TO BE ELIMINATED (3)</CENTER></H3>
<P>
Just as America's taxpayers can do without the three cabinet-level
departments targeted for elimination in the House GOP Budget,
they can surely get along without the 13 agencies the House GOP
Budget would eliminate.  For example:
<UL>
<LI>The U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration was created in
1981 and spends $17 million per year promoting tourism and recreation
activities by conducting surveys, distributing promotional material,
and running regional marketing shows.  There is no reason for
the federal government to be involved in an activity that is already
handled by a prosperous private industry.[5]
<P>
<LI>The Minority Business Development Agency was created in 1971
to promote the development of minority-owned businesses and to
steer these businesses toward government contracts.  It was appropriated
$44 million in fiscal 1996 even though it duplicates a  loan program
run by the Small Business Administration.[6] 
<P>
<LI>The Maritime Administration was created in 1950 to tap the
domestic maritime fleet in case of national emergency.  Unfortunately,
the government-owned &quot;Ready Reserve Force&quot; was not seaworthy
during the Persian Gulf call-up.   The Maritime Administration
is part of the Department of Transportation and primarily acts
as a custodian of federal subsidies used to shield U.S. vessels
from foreign competition.[7]  But most (96 percent) of all waterborne
cargo entering or leaving the U.S. is on American vessels.
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>PROGRAMS ELIMINATED (284)</CENTER></H3>
<P>
Likewise, most taxpayers aren't likely to miss the 284 programs
eliminated by the House GOP Budget.  These programs include:
<UL>
<LI>The Federal Helium Reserve and Processing Facility will cost
$26 million over the next five years.  It was established in 1925
to insure a constant supply of helium for military blimps and
observation balloons which are no longer used.  The United States
produces most of the world's helium, exporting 5.5 times as much
helium as is produced worldwide.  But the government stays in
the helium business because of a federal ban prohibiting NASA
and the Pentagon from purchasing privately produced helium.[8]
<P>
<LI>The Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, which will
spend $2.7 million in 1995, was established in 1972 to oversee
the &quot;Avenue's revitalization.&quot;  The corporation is governed
by a 23-member board which oversees joint ventures with the private
sector, sponsors festivals, cultural performances, and athletic
events on Washington's Pennsylvania Avenue.[9]
<P>
<LI>The Points of Light Foundation in its first four years spent
$22 million on administrative expenses and $4 million on grants
to service organizations.  Expenses included $1.4 million for
a kickoff celebration and more than $108,000 paid to a public
relations firm to promote the party, as well as a $160,000 salary
for its top executive.[10]
<P>
<LI>The National Rail Passenger Corporation (AMTRAK) was created
in 1970 to take over the nation's ailing private passenger rail
service.  It has cost the taxpayer $17 billion but carries less
than one-half of one percent of America's inter-city passengers
or about 22 million passengers a year, a quarter of the entire
rail passenger service.[11]
<P>
<LI>The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) was established
in 1968 and now sponsors more than 600 National Public Radio (NPR)
stations and 340 Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) television
stations.  PBS and NPR are primarily (80 percent) funded through
private and non-federal public donations, but the federal share
provided by CPB for fiscal year 1996  is $286 million.[12]
<P>
<LI>The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) was created in 1974 to
provide low-income individuals with legal representation. LSC
will spend part of this year's $415 million budget to fund lobbying
or campaigning for local political initiatives.  The agency, a
piggybank for left-wing causes, has fought reforms designed to
reduce out-of-wedlock births; filed suit against a nonprofit homeless
shelter; and tried to create a &quot;constitutional right&quot;
to federal welfare.[13]
<P>
<LI>The AmeriCorps program, created by President Clinton, funds
community-based organizations &quot;to address problems they identify
by using the skills of individuals serving in National Service
positions.&quot;  Participants are given a stipend, an educational
award or credit toward student loan repayment, medical benefits,
and free child care for volunteer work.  The taxpayer cost for
each &quot;volunteer&quot; exceeds $30,000 or more than $3 billion
over the next five years.[14]
<P>
<LI>The National Endowment for the Arts has been a platform for
attacks on religion, traditional art forms, traditional families
and traditional values, and a forum for the promotion of homosexuality.
 NEA grants greatly influence what is presented in museums and
theaters and what private donors feel is worthy of support.  As
former NEA Chairman John Frohnmayer noted: &quot;Our grantees
state unequivocally that fund-raising is substantially easier
because of an Endowment grant.  It is an endorsement-a mark of
quality and achievement.&quot;[15] In 1994, the private sector donated
more than $9.6 billion to the arts.
<P>
<LI>The Mary McLeod Bethune Memorial Fine Arts Center located
on the Campus of Bethune Cookman College in Daytona Beach, Florida
received a grant of $4 million from the Department of Education.
 The facility will allow students to be trained for the fields
of entertainment and hotel management, fields adequately covered
by the private sector.[16]
<P>
<LI>The Essential Air Service Program (EASP) was created in 1978
to continue air service to small communities.  EASP will spend
$28 million in 1996 subsidizing commuter service to 80 communities.
 It was initially authorized for a ten-year period.  The subsidies
that these airlines receive from taxpayers range from $5 to $320
per passenger.[17]
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>BOARDS, COMMISSIONS, AUTHORITIES TO BE ELIMINATED (269)</CENTER></H3>
<P>
Similarly, it is difficult to justify deficit spending to support
many federal boards, commissions, and authorities.  Among those
the House GOP wants to delete are:
<UL>
<LI>The Interstate Commerce Commission was created in 1887 to
oversee the rail industry.  It now oversees rail traffic, trucking,
barges, buses, freight forwarders and express companies.   Legislation
that deregulated transportation has increased competition and
made the ICC largely obsolete.[18]
<P>
<LI>The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) was created in 1965
to fight poverty.  It is one of 62 federal economic development
programs under 18 federal departments and agencies.  ARC is currently
funded at $200 million.[19]
<P>
<LI>The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) was created in 1933 to
generate and distribute electric power for the Tennessee Valley.
 Today, TVA manages locks, dams and recreation areas, operates
a research center, and funds economic development.
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES TO BE PRIVATIZED (3)</CENTER></H3>
<P>
Rather than believing worthwhile public functions must be performed
by government, the House GOP Budget plan recognizes that commercial
activities ought to be privatized.  Specifically:
<UL>
<LI>The Department of Energy operates five Power Marketing Administrations
which sell electricity from 131 dams.  In 1994, the PMA's sold
$3 billion worth of electric power.  The Budget Committee recommends
selling four of the PMA's, which are not a profitable investment
for the taxpayer.[20] 
<P>
<LI>The Naval Petroleum Reserves were established in 1912 by Presidents
William Howard Taft and Woodwork Wilson to assure fuel for the
Navy.  The project oversees two commercial oil fields and an oil-shale
reserve.  Studies show that these facilities operate far less
efficiently than comparable privately-owned fields.[21]
<P>
<LI>The United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC)  produces
and markets uranium enrichment services to private utilities in
the U.S. and abroad.  USEC advertises that it serves &quot;approximately
90 percent of the domestic market and about 40 percent of the
world market.&quot;[22] This taxpayer- financed commercial enterprise
could be sold for profit and operated more efficiently through
privatization.
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Individually, these programmatic cuts may not amount to much;
 but collectively these changes translate into hundreds of billions
of taxpayer savings and a balanced federal budget by 2002.

A study of fruit flies by National Institutes of Health scientists
has rekindled the debate over whether homosexuality has a genetic
component. 
<P>
A set of male fruit flies, the study reports, formed mating chains
with each other after their body chemistry was altered.  But a
close look at the study reveals that the most reasonable conclusions
from the evidence are that male and female sex drives are quite
different, and that frenzied males, under certain conditions,
will mate with anything, even other males. 
<P>
Writing in the June 1995 <I>Proceedings of the National Academy
of Sciences</I>, Shang-Ding Zhang and Ward F. Odenwald of the
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke division
of the National Institutes of Health report a heightening of the
sexual activities of fruit flies that had been heat-treated to
reduce levels of the chemical serotonin.[1] Reduction of serotonin
has been linked in other studies to an increase in sexual activity
and same-sex coupling among some animals (rats, cats, and rabbits).[2]

<P>
Media reports, predictably, have exaggerated the actual findings
of the research.  <I>Time,</I> for instance, reported that the
new study &quot;adds to the mounting evidence that homosexuality
has genetic origins....&quot;[3]
<P>
The <I>Time</I> article and other media reports ignore or underreport
key elements of the study that work against the claim that homosexuality
may be hereditary or even partly hereditary.  One finding was
that altered females, the study notes, were not affected in any
discernible way.  
<P>
Another finding -- that normal males resisted sexual advances
by the altered males for up to two hours and then succumbed to
same-sex activity -- indicates strongly that homosexual behavior
is environmentally induced. 
<P>
From the study:
<P>
&quot;At the beginning of chaining periods, in bottles containing
[more than] 80 percent transformants [treated flies], nontransformant
males were observed only at 
the head of fast moving chains where they repeatedly displayed
repelling signals to advancing suitors -- i.e. wing-flicking,
face-kicking, and/or running away....After a 2-hr. exposure to
vigorous transformant courtship, many, if not all, of the nontransformants
were observed courting and inducing courtship.&quot;[4]
<P>
In bottles in which females were present, the females formed defensive
clusters, impeding males' efforts to mate with them.  In one jar
pictured in the article, the females were huddled at the very
bottom while the males formed long lines of sexual activity in
the rest of the jar.  Some of the males did mate with the females,
but the females offered resistance.  
<P>
As the study explains: 
<P>
&quot;Lead males would typically break off their heterosexual
advances after experiencing one or more of her repelling signals...such
as kicking his face and/or running or flying away.  During vigorous
chaining periods, females predominantly grouped together in tight
clusters; however, no female-female courtship was observed in
or outside of these dense packs.&quot;[5]
<P>
The male &quot;homosexual&quot; activity might have had little
to do with preference and merely involve frenzied mating with
the nearest available partner.
<P>
But listen to how <I>Time</I> magazine summarizes the participation
by the &quot;straight&quot; males:
<P>
&quot;While the gays formed their conga lines, the straights stayed
to the side -- but only temporarily.  After a few hours, the straights
joined in and, for the time being, acted gay.&quot;[6]
<P>
No mention is made by <I>Time</I> of the struggle by the &quot;straight&quot;
flies to ward off the hypersexual males.  And the use of the word
&quot;gay&quot; to describe the flies gives them anthropomorphic
overtones; that is, the writer attributes human characteristics
to a non-human rather than vice-versa.  But the notion of being
&quot;gay&quot; is a calculated construct of self-identification
for political purposes.  Many people struggling with homosexuality
reject the idea that their defining characteristic is to be &quot;gay.&quot;[7]
 The <I>Time</I> article does concede that &quot;[t]he type of
gene they've been studying in fruit flies could not begin to account
for the complex variations in human homosexual behavior.  For
one thing, the gene does not cause flies to renounce heterosexuality
altogether.  If a 'gay' fly is surrounded by females instead of
males, he'll fertilize the lady flies.&quot;[8]
<P>
Another culturally significant fact from the study is that when
non-treated male flies constituted 50 percent or more of the population
in a bottle, the researchers found that &quot;little or no chaining
was detected and nontransformant participation was rarely observed.&quot;[9]
<P>
In other words, when the bottle's &quot;culture&quot; was at least
half normal, the male-to-male sex occurred not at all or rarely.
 But when the normal flies were surrounded by &quot;homosexual&quot;
flies and attacked repeatedly, they finally gave in to the behavior.
 Again, it is perilous to extrapolate insect studies to humans,
but this sounds much like experiences reported among convicts.
 Otherwise sexually normal prison inmates sometimes indulge in
homosexual behavior, not because of genetics but because of the
immediate environment (coercion, lack of opposite-sex partners,
peer acceptance of the behavior).  According to psychiatrist and
author Jeffrey B. Satinover, &quot;It is common knowledge that
when some heterosexual men are placed in isolation for long periods
of time with each other that they will engage in homosexual behavior.
 But, once released, they will resume their heterosexual behavior.&quot;[10]
<P>
The social sciences are increasingly looking to animals or insects
for clues to human behavior, even though human sexuality is quite
different.  But if any lessons are to be drawn for human purposes,
they might be these:
<P>
<LI>  The sexes are quite different in their sexual needs, drives
and reactions to particular stimulants.
<P>
<LI>  A culture that hopes to maintain its sexual norms is at risk
when a critical mass of deviant behavior occurs.
<P>
 <LI> Homosexual behavior is learned, and occurs among those who are
vulnerable to the environmental factors that tend to produce homosexual
behavior. 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
As with other studies purporting to show a genetic link to homosexuality,
the NIH study is being hailed by homosexual activists, who are
trying to equate homosexuality with an immutable characteristic
such as skin color or ethnic origin in their drive to create support
for an entirely new category of behavior-based special civil rights.
<P>
The actual research often reveals something entirely different
from what is claimed.  Researchers Zhang and Odenwald summarize
that &quot;both genetic and environmental factors play a role
in male sexual behavior[11]....elements of the basic machinery controlling
male sexual behavior may be highly conserved between taxonomically
distinct organisms.&quot;[12] They call for more research on the
topic to &quot;enhance our knowledge of the underlying mechanisms
controlling sexual behavior.&quot;[13]
<P>
The study is interesting.  But it gives no hard evidence of anything
other than the fact that male fruit flies subjected to a sexual
stimulant may mate with anything in sight.  In March 1993, two
Columbia University psychiatrists examined the various studies
purporting to find a homosexual biologic component.   They concluded
that &quot;there is no evidence at present to substantiate a biologic
theory...the appeal of current biologic explanations for sexual
orientation may derive more from dissatisfaction with the present
status of psychosocial explanations than from a substantiating
body of experimental data.&quot;[14]
<P>
In other words, politics, not science, is driving the debate.
 An honest look at the evidence of 70 years of psychology, therapeutic
research, the history of the entire human race, and the moral
codes of all the great civilizations tells us that homosexuality
is not only universally discouraged as learned behavior but can
also be temporary, controlled, or even changed.
<P>
Given the well-documented, socially and medically destructive
effects of homosexual behavior on individuals, families and communities,
compassion and prudence should lead us to discourage any cultural
promotion of homosexuality as a moral and normal activity.  Media
reports indicate that homosexual experimentation among high schoolers
has increased considerably in recent years as schools have presented
homosexual activity as normal, desirable and even &quot;cool.&quot;[15]
 Sexually vulnerable young people are being steered onto a behavioral
path that they and their families will sorely regret and which
will even cost some of them their lives at an early age.
<P>
Homosexual behavior, like other destructive vices, can be learned
-- and unlearned.  Under no circumstances should it be promoted,
particularly through misrepresentation of scientific studies.

<P>
Federal arts funding, much like the welfare system, has created
a class of beneficiaries who are hostile to conservative, pro-family
causes.  Recipients of federal aid all too often become cheerleaders
for big government, the family's natural enemy.  Big government
strips families of their incomes through confiscatory taxation
and diminishes their autonomy through intrusive social welfare
and educational programs designed to wean children from their
parents (and parental values) at earlier and earlier ages. 
<P>
The same taxpayers who suffer the indignity of seeing their own
earnings used by bureaucrats to undermine their families also
pay for a federally-subsidized artistic and media elite to cheer
on their tormentors: the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,
the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment
for the Humanities.
<P>
It is long past time that the federal arts and humanities endowments
be de-authorized and de-funded.  Spawned during the 1960s' Great
Society years, these agencies, despite whatever good they have
done, have damaged American culture, ripped off the taxpayer,
waged war on the family and religion, and politicized the academy
and the arts.   
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CURRENT PROPOSALS TO TRIM THE ENDOWMENTS ARE ILL-ADVISED AND
COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Merely cutting the budgets and stretching out the life of the
agencies will cause more mischief.  When Proposition 13 was enacted
into law in California, hostile government officials began cutting
back on essentials, such as police and fire departments, leaving
the waste and fat untouched.  The object lesson to the voters
was that challenging government growth meant the onset of anarchy.
 Similarly, if the federal budgets for public broadcasting and
the arts and humanities are merely reduced, the truly offensive
offerings will be the last to be de-funded.  Vengeful bureaucrats
will trim where it will cause the most pain and where patrons
would complain most loudly.  A couple of years ago, when Congress
stalled in passing an appropriations bill for the federal government,
the Smithsonian closed its 
doors, as did some national parklands, enraging taxpaying visitors.
 But the long-obsolete federal Helium Reserve suffered no loss
of gas.  Again, the message to the voters was:  we will punish
you if you don't lobby your elected representatives to reinstate
our funding -- with increases. 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>SOME POLITICIANS THINK THEY CAN BUY PEACE BY APPEASING THEIR
OPPONENT. INSTEAD, THEY CREATE A HARDENED ENEMY.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
In terms of the federal endowments, the political price is actually
higher for merely cutting instead of eliminating them.  Recipients
of federal aid are the natural foes of budget cutters and will
continue to use their taxpayer-provided subsidies to wage political
war on them.  Hundreds of arts organizations are being lobbied
to bring pressure on individual members of Congress to preserve
art pork in their own districts.
<P>
A case in point is a letter from Independent Television Service
Executive Director James Yee to public broadcasting advocates.
 The taxpayer-supported (and, therefore, in no way independent)
ITVS was created in 1988 to provide new programming for public
broadcasting.  Yee urges his &quot;independent colleagues&quot;
to &quot;become involved in future efforts to drum up support
for public broadcasting, especially with your local and national
elected officials....&quot;  Yee warns that &quot;an extensive
informational outreach campaign will have to be waged.&quot; 
Such campaigns cost money, but are easier to mount when federal
subsidies pour in to handle other costs.  
<P>
The current House plan to phase out the endowments serves only
to give welfare artists some time to restore their subsidies.
 Indeed, subsidy supporters have acknowledged, through their accord,
that the phase-out plan is their best hope for saving the agencies
and returning to business as usual.[1] 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CUTTING BACK THE ENDOWMENTS WILL NOT LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT REFORM.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Congress repeatedly has slapped NEA on the wrist, and still the
NEA sends money to The Kitchen, Franklin Furnace and other centers
of blatantly offensive &quot;performance&quot; art that denigrates
religion, families and traditional morality.  Indeed, a <I>Washington
Post</I> critic observed recently that the 1993 Biennial Exhibition
at the NEA-funded Whitney Museum was &quot;one long whinging [sic]
whine of political correctness, suggesting as it did that the
only art that counts is art produced by lesbians, inhabitants
of barrios, sufferers of AIDS and others on the margin.&quot;
 Two years later, at the 1995 Biennial, &quot;[h]omosexuality's
still hot, especially the kinds involving punctures of the flesh,
accessories of leather, bondage and cross-dressing, but so too
are the subtlest of painterly abstraction.  Nuances and nipple-rings
are both themes of this exhibit, if it can be said to have any
themes at all.&quot;[2]
<P>
NEA chairwoman Jane Alexander has boasted of using the endowment
to promote homosexual themes[3] and has even defended a public bloodletting
by an HIV-infected  performer at an NEA-subsidized venue.[4]  Despite
many assurances by past and present NEA officials that excellence
and artistic merit are the criteria for grant allocation, this
is clearly not the case.  More than $9 billion in private giving
sustains arts in communities all over America.[5] The NEA's $175
million is important more for its symbolism than for the actual
dollars involved.  An NEA grant validates an artist, and the government
should not be putting its imprimatur on much of the anti-family,
anti-religious propaganda that counter-culture activists brazenly
categorize as art.  The entertainment industry has revenues in
the tens of billions of dollars  each year.  Time-Warner alone
took in $15.9 billion during 1994.  Clearly, Hollywood is in a
better position to subsidize the endowments for arts and humanities
than US taxpayers who struggling to get out from under $200 billion
in annual deficits.
<P>
<CENTER><H3> CORPORATION FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING</H3></CENTER>
<P>
In 1967, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Public Broadcasting
Act creating CPB.  The agency oversees the Public Broadcasting
Service, which was formed in 1969, a year before the creation
of National Public Radio.  CPB's total appropriation in fiscal
1969 was $5 million.  In 1992, Congress re-authorized CPB with
a three-year, $1.1 billion appropriation.  By 1993, CPB's annual
federal appropriation was $318.6 million, which rose to $386 million
for fiscal 1995.  There are 349 public TV stations and 200 TV
grantees receiving CPB funding.[6]  PBS claims to reach 1.8 million
teachers and 29.5 million students through educational programming
and services, and 97 million Americans overall each week with
some PBS programming.[7] National Public Radio is carried on 595
stations, and CPB awards money to 391 public radio grantees. 
<P>
The basis for CPB's existence has always been an anti-free market
philosophy.   Proponents have said that the market is incapable
of providing good programming, so the government must step in
and do it, to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars annually.[8]
 Yet the shows that register high ratings on PBS turn out to be
the very programs that the public perceives to be excellent: <I>Sesame
Street</I>, <I>Barney and Friends</I>, <I>The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour</I>,
and <I>Masterpiece Theatre</I>, for example.  All of these shows
are generating more than sufficient revenue from sponsors, donors,
grants and product marketing.  They do not need taxpayer subsidies.
<P>
But there is other CPB programming that probably would fail to
attract a sufficient viewing/listening audience or donor support.
 These programs are so bad that their creators must dig into the
public purse.  Subsidizing bad art is a donor's prerogative, of
course -- unless the &quot;donor&quot; is the taxpayer, who has
no choice.  (For detailed examples, see FRC's Policy paper entitled
&quot;Public Broadcasting?  Let's Free Big Bird.&quot;)
<P>
<CENTER><H3> NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
NEA was established in 1965 when President Johnson signed the
National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act, which also
created the National Endowment for the Humanities.  NEA's initial
budget was $2.5 million, but grew over the years to about $175
million annually (fiscal 1995 appropriation is $167.7 million).
 A fiscal 1995 rescission bill, HR 1158, would reduce 1995 funding
to $162.5 million.[9] All told, NEA has spent more than $3 billion
of tax money in its 30-year history.   
<P>
The plan approved by the House Economic and Educational Opportunities
Committee on May 10, 1995 would reauthorize NEA through fiscal
1998 but eliminate funding in fiscal 1999.  Funding would be reduced
by 40 percent in fiscal 1996, another 40 percent in fiscal 1997
and by 20 percent in fiscal 1998. The NEA would get no money in
fiscal 1999.[10]
<P>
NEA would also face a $5 million cap on administrative expenses,
which would entail an 80 percent reduction in budget for staff.
 Currently, NEA spends $24 million annually on administration.[11]
<P>
Beginning in 1996, grants to individuals would be eliminated,
with all grants going to institutions.  Eighty percent of annual
appropriations to the state art councils would be in the form
of block grants.[12]
<P>
A Senate bill (S 856) introduced by James Jeffords (R-VT) and
co-sponsored by Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS), Alan Simpson (R-WY), Edward
Kennedy (D-MA) and Claiborne Pell (D-RI) would reauthorize NEA
for five years (FY 1996-2000) at gradually reduced funding levels.
 Forty percent of the NEA's program budget would go to &quot;partnership&quot;
grants with the states, local and regional groups; 40% more would
go toward organizations of &quot;national significance;&quot;
a final 20% would go to direct grants to organizations, such as
theaters or museums, and to individual artists. 
<P>
Most significantly, the bill keeps intact much of the current
peer review system, in which panelists award federal tax dollars
to their friends and associates.  It also locks in place the conditions
under which the NEA would reject a grant over &quot;obscenity.&quot;
 An artwork would have to be found legally obscene in a court
of law before the NEA could move to recover funds.  Given that
a grant from the NEA automatically gives an artwork &quot;artistic&quot;
significance no matter how offensive, the provision is meaningless
in terms of curbing abuses of taxpayer funding.  
<P>
The bill also directs the current NEA director to give &quot;Distinguished
Lifetime Service for the Arts&quot; awards to &quot;each of the
former Chairpersons of the Endowment.&quot;  This means that federal
taxpayers would honor, among others, John Frohnmayer, the NEA
chief whose tenure ended when he was forced by President Bush
to resign over NEA's continued funding of anti-Christian and pornographic
works. 
<P>
Finally, the bill creates an entirely new federal agency to nationalize
standards for all public libraries and museums.  The &quot;Institute
for Museum and Library Services&quot; would be authorized for
five years, beginning with a budget of $75 million in fiscal 1996
&quot;and such sums as may be necessary for each of the 4 succeeding
fiscal years,&quot; and would have grant-making authority.  This
is a potentially lucrative source to be abused by well-connected
left-wing groups like the American Library Association, would
give the federal government potential control over the nation's
local public libraries, and would do to libraries and museums
what the NEA has done to art -- redefine it using federal tax
dollars to further a radical cultural and political agenda. 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES</H3></CENTER>
<P>
NEH was established at the same time NEA was born, in 1965.  The
fiscal year 1966 budget was $5.9 million, and the agency had a
staff of 13.[13] The agency expanded over the years until it reached
a budget of $177 million in fiscal 1995.  
<P>
Officials at the NEH are hardly contrite for sponsoring a widely-denounced
set of national history standards that, among other things, emphasize
the role of the Ku Klux Klan (17 references) and exalt Soviet
advances in space while ignoring Albert Einstein, the Wright Brothers,
Paul Revere, Robert E. Lee and the American moon landing.[14] The
NEH also specializes in promoting cultural relativism, feminist
studies and other Marxist and neo-Marxist theoretical quagmires
on the nation's campuses.[15]
<P>
The current plan approved by the House Economic and Educational
Opportunities Committee would reauthorize NEH with an annual 20
percent funding reduction through fiscal 1998 starting with the
1995 appropriation of $172 million (which includes a recent House-approved
$5 million rescission).  No funding would be allocated to NEH
in 1999.  The 5 percent cap for administrative expenses would
also apply to NEH, as well as the termination of direct federal
grants to individuals (scholars would continue to receive grants
through recipient organizations such as universities).  Eighty
percent of appropriations would go to state humanities councils
in the form of block grants.  Senate bill S 856 would reauthorize
NEH for five years at gradually reduced funding levels, beginning
with $168.6 million in fiscal year 1996.  Each state would get
a minimum of $200,000 in funding each fiscal year.  Grants would
continue to be made to &quot;groups, individuals, and State agencies
or entities.&quot;  
<P>
<CENTER><H3>SUMMARY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Attempts to curry favor with the welfare broadcast media and arts
groups are useless and only embolden the political enemies of
budget cutters.  So, we must ask budget-cutting Members of Congress:
why give the very people who will never love you enough subsidies
to stay in business so they can continue taking shots at you?
 The federal arts subsidies must end once and for all.

<h2>DRUG ABUSE PREVENTION:<br>
HOW TO KEEP KIDS DRUG FREE</h2>

<p>
The recent dramatic rise in drug abuse is fueled by a pro-drug
culture, generational forgetfulness and crippled prevention programs.
 The problem demands renewed grassroots attention by parents,
community involvement and aggressive, private and public, national
anti-drug leadership.
<P>
Drug abuse is symptomatic of  numerous social pathologies such
as rampant fatherlessness which afflicts 18 million American children.
 And abuse has personal and cultural consequences:  increased
crime, poorer health, lowered productivity, and significant costs
to the nation in health and welfare support.  Curbing this scourge
must become a national priority.
<P>
This paper will profile the drug abuse problem, the culture's
contribution to that problem, the parents' role and the history
and future of organized, drug prevention programs.
<P>
<center><h3>A RISE IN DRUG ABUSE PORTENDS MORE VIOLENCE</h3></center>
<P>
A 1994 survey by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) found
that marijuana use among 8th graders rose from 6.2 percent in
1991 to 13 percent in 1994.  A similar trend is evident among
10th and 12th graders.  Adolescent abuse of cocaine, crack, heroin,
and LSD is also rising.[1]
<P>
The Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education (PRIDE) reports
that the U.S. is in the midst of a new wave of adolescent drug
abuse.  Associated with this increase is more violent behavior.
 PRIDE found that children who use alcohol, marijuana, hallucinogens,
and/or cocaine are significantly more likely to carry a gun to
school, take part in gang activities, attempt suicide, threaten
to harm another, and get in trouble with the police than children
who abstain from drugs.[2]
<P>
The Supreme Court agrees that there is a relationship between
drug abuse and juvenile crime.   On June 26, 1995, in the case
of <I>Vernonia School</I>
<I>District v. Acton,</I> the court decided  that school-sponsored
drug testing is constitutional, giving local officials a tool
to fight the problem.[3]
<P>
The Vernonia School District told the high court that disciplinary
problems had reached &quot;epidemic proportions.&quot;   The school
administration concluded that rebellion in the classroom was fueled
by alcohol and drug abuse and that student athletes were the leaders
of the drug culture.   
<P>
After a parent &quot;input night&quot; to discuss a proposed drug
test policy for athletes, the parents present gave unanimous approval.
 The policy's purpose is to &quot;prevent student athletes from
using drugs, to protect their health and safety, and to provide
drug users with assistance programs.&quot;  The high court okayed
athlete drug testing. 
<P>
<center><h3>A PRO-DRUG CULTURE</h3></center>
<P>
Andrew Peyton Thomas, Arizona assistant attorney general and a
former NAACP counsel, writes in <I>Crime and the Sacking of America,
&quot;</I>There is ... an undeniable
relationship between crime and drugs.  Drug addiction can both
lower inhibitions among offenders and spur them on to other crimes
to finance their dependency.&quot;  He argues that in spite of
the synergism of crime and drugs, analysts cannot conclude that
drugs cause crime.  In fact, drugs &quot;do not ingest themselves
... Drugs reach their human hosts only after being invited.&quot;
  What then leads children to use drugs?[4]
<P>
James Burke, chairman of the Partnership for a Drug Free America,
told delegates at the May 1995 American Cities Against Drugs Convention
in Atlanta that in 1962 there were fewer than four million people
who tried illegal drugs.  By 1993, this number had grown to 80
million who had tried drugs, with six million in various stages
of addiction.[5]
<P>
According to Burke, attitudes drive drug abuse:  &quot;In the
last two years, the numbers [of drug abusers] have gone up dramatically.
 We allowed it to happen.  We were going in the right direction.
 We took our eye off the ball.  Kids [today] view illegal drugs
as less dangerous and more acceptable.&quot;[6]  Burke attributes
the attitude shift to fewer news stories about the risks of drugs,
more pro-drug information, more legalization discussions, and
reglamorization of drugs by the music industry.
<P>
A national survey released by the Center on Addiction and Substance
Abuse at Columbia University supports Burke's contention.  It
found that 76 percent of adolescents and 67 percent of adults
blame the popular culture -- television shows, movies, magazines,
and popular music -- for encouraging illegal drug use.  One-third
of the adolescents also said that drugs are the most important
problem facing them.[7]
<P>
The Washington pollster who did the survey, Frank Luntz, explains,
&quot;It's not parents talking about children.  It's kids talking
about themselves.&quot;  The polls show that respondents feel
that the entertainment industry helps to create an environment
in which drug use is not stigmatized.[8]
<P>
Other pro-drug influences are working to transform the culture.
 For example, youth clothing manufacturers like Adidas produce
shoes called &quot;Chronic,&quot; which are made from hemp and
named after the slang term for a marijuana-packed cigar.[9]
<P>
Cultural icons like baseball star Darryl Strawberry undercut anti-drug
messages. Strawberry is an admitted cocaine addict and alcoholic
who has been jailed for spousal abuse and convicted of fraud.
 Although his former manager, Tommy Lasorda of the Los Angeles
Dodgers, said Strawberry ought to be in jail, not playing baseball,
New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner recently signed Strawberry
to a new contract.  Lee Brown, Office of National Drug Control
Policy director, said that Steinbrenner's decision tells our youth,
&quot;If you use drugs, you can be rewarded with big money in
big-time sports ... It is no wonder kids may think that star athletes
are into drugs and there are no real penalties.&quot;[11]
<P>
Even television news programs have taken up the pro-drug banner.
 ABC aired &quot;America's War on Drugs -- Searching for Solutions&quot;
on April 6, 1995.  It includes a litany of distortions such as
the unproven notion that legalizing drugs will reduce crime  and
that drug treatment is a better alternative than enforcement.[12]
<P>
Former CBS news anchor Walter Cronkite hosted a <I>Discovery Channel</I>
program entitled &quot;The War on Drugs.&quot;   The June 20,
1995 documentary sympathetically profiles the plight of jailed
drug offenders, declares the drug war lost, and calls on President
Clinton to form a bipartisan commission with sweeping powers to
reappraise the war.
<P>
<I>NBC Nightly News</I> profiled a commentary by marijuana advocate
Dr. Lester Grinspoon which appeared in the June 1995 <I>Journal
of the American Medical Association</I>.[13]  The NBC &quot;Health
News&quot; segment by Robert Bazell interviewed many people who
claim marijuana helps them with medical problems that include
AIDS, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma, and cancer.  NBC ignores more
than 10,500 scientific studies which chronicle the adverse consequences
of marijuana use.[14]
<P>
<center><h3>GENERATIONAL AMNESIA</h3></center>
<P>
The drug crisis of the 1970s was reversed by the parents of the
1980s who took charge.  They became involved in their children's
lives, forced schools and community organizations to join the
fight, and supported efforts by President and Mrs. Reagan, who
promised to make drug fighting a national priority.
<P>
Gary Fields, school superintendent in Zion, Illinois, believes
that today's teens are being raised by &quot;drugged parents&quot;
who struggle with their own abuse history and often enable their
children.  He says these parents must stop denying the problem
and he encourages them to give their children a strong anti-drug
message at home.  Otherwise, he says, school-based prevention
programs won't work.[15]
<P>
Southern Methodist University professor Robert Hampson studies
child and adolescent behavior.  He says that parental involvement
in drug-abuse prevention is critical to helping children stay
drug free.  &quot;A healthy family,&quot; he explains, &quot;is
one in which the children respect their elders, older siblings
serve as strong role models, communication lines remain open and
parents remain open, and parents feel empowered to shape their
children's lives.&quot;[16]
<P>
Deborah Cohen of Louisiana State University Medical Center led
a study to identify specific parenting behaviors associated with
the onset of alcohol and tobacco use.  Cohen's 1994 study, published
in <I>Pediatrics,</I> found that children who reported that parents
spent more time with them and communicated with them were less
likely to use alcohol and tobacco.[17]  Another 1994 study in
<I>Pediatrics</I> found that parental monitoring is an effective tool 
in the prevention of drug use.[18]
<P>
Research has identified numerous risk factors that contribute
to adolescent drug abuse.  They include:  availability of drugs,
family and community mobility, community safety, parental drug
use or attitude toward drugs, and level of supervision.
<P>
The Virginia Council on Coordinating Prevention found that most
children who defy the odds of becoming drug abusers &quot;have
had the opportunity to establish a close bond with at least one
person who provided them with stable care and from whom they received
adequate and appropriate attention during the first year of life.&quot;
 A caring and supportive relationship remains the most critical
variable throughout childhood and adolescence.  In fact, even
for those from a troubled home environment, &quot;a good relationship
with one parent&quot; provides a substantial protective effect.[19]
<P>
Rosemary Hinojosa recognizes the need to empower parents to rear
resilient children.  She is the executive director of La Familia
Fuerte [Strong Family], a drug abuse prevention program for Mexican-American
children in Dallas, Texas.  Her program takes a holistic approach
which involves parents in keeping children drug free.  She educates
parents on child-rearing, health, and substance abuse issues.[20]
<P>
&quot;We're trying,&quot; Hinojosa says, &quot;to help the families
draw from their own strengths and allow them to see they have
those strengths, so when we're gone, they can fall back on them.&quot;[21]
<P>
Hinojosa's focus on the home is proper, but some children don't
have parents who are willing or prepared to guide them away from
drugs.  In these cases, when parents fail, government has become
a poor substitute.
<P>
<center><h3>HISTORY OF DRUG PREVENTION</h3></center>
<P>
Drug abuse is an international problem.  For example, in the 1960s,
then-Chinese Premier Chou En-lai told Egyptian President Gamal
Abdel Nasser, &quot;We are getting back at the West now.  We are
helping the Vietnamese make drug slaves of the American GIs with
heroin and hashish.&quot;[22]
<P>
Chou En-lai blamed the 19th-century British [translated &quot;the
West&quot;] for smuggling opium into China, leaving 90 million
opium addicts.  Hoping to curb the opium supply, the Chinese &quot;illegally&quot;
disposed of tons of British opium.  The British responded by starting
the First Opium War, which was settled in their favor after China
ceded Hong Kong.  
<P>
The Chinese opium plague wasn't resolved until the 1950s and only
after unprecedented public health efforts.   Neighboring Japan
fought an amphetamine epidemic that began during World War II
with government encouragement in order to keep war factories producing
and men fighting.  They were sold without prescription for &quot;elimination
of drowsiness and repletion of the spirits.&quot;
<P>
In 1951, the Japanese government passed the Awakening Drug Control
Law to deal with the nearly two percent (750,000) of the population
who were abusing amphetamines.  The law began a successful three-year
campaign to eradicate the abuse through treatment, education and
stiff penalties.[23]
<P>
Singapore had a heroin epidemic in the late 1970s.  Poh Geok Ek,
director of the Central Narcotics Bureau, states, &quot;The situation
called for immediate action; otherwise, heroin, like an infectious
disease, would spread like wildfire.&quot;[24]
<P>
Singapore adopted harsh laws that called for the death penalty
for trafficking more than 15 grams.  Between 1980 and 1985, 15
people were hanged.   That country also embraced large-scale and
mandatory &quot;cold-turkey&quot; drug rehabilitation.  Poh explained:
 &quot;Our aim is to persuade the addict that he no longer needs
the drug and finally to give him an incentive to replace the drug
with a more satisfying way of life.&quot;
<P>
The Singaporean rehab model includes indoctrination and a military-style
exercise regimen, followed by six months in a halfway house and
two years of close drug supervision.  Today, Singapore has one
of the lowest drug abuse rates in the world.
<P>
 The American Civil War (1861-1865) created a morphine epidemic.
 Many soldiers who were treated with morphine for battlefield
wounds became addicted.  After the war, local drugstores and mail-order
firms like Sears Roebuck legally sold opium or morphine, and by
the beginning of the 20th century, one percent of the U.S. population
were opium addicts.[25]
<P>
The U.S. has fought the opium trade for most of two centuries.
 America signed a treaty with Siam in 1833 acknowledging the need
to curb the flow of opium.  President Teddy Roosevelt organized
the 1909 Shanghai Convention to control the production, manufacturing,
export, import, and distribution of narcotics.[26]
<P>
The U.S. pushed for an international meeting in the Netherlands,
which produced the Hague Opium Convention in January 1912.  That
treaty included, for the first time, control over cocaine.  The
Hague Treaty provided the basis for the 1914 Harrison Narcotics
Bill, which committed the U.S. to controlling drug trafficking.
<P>
After World War II, heroin emerged as a major problem in America's
inner cities.  The government responded by embracing treatment
modalities, including methadone maintenance, therapeutic communities,
and outpatient care.  Politicians passed abstinence laws and created
a phalanx of anti-drug forces.  Meanwhile, educators joined the
fray by stressing information about types of drugs and the negative
consequences from their use.  Proponents of this approach argued
that teens used illicit drugs because they were ignorant of their
harmful nature.  
<P>
This scare tactic approach was replaced by values clarification
(teaching social and personal skills). Today, most programs are
characterized as risk based protective factor type approaches.
<P>
School-based programs designed to prevent drug abuse have been
an integral part of the nation's anti-drug effort for more than
two decades.  Drug education is a $2 billion industry replete
with teachers' seminars and anti-drug texts.  Most of the money
comes from block grants for counseling, and social work.  Yet
there is conflicting evidence whether these programs really make
a difference.
<P>
The President's 1995 National Drug Control Strategy paper concludes
&quot;that only prevention efforts can bring about a long-term
solution to the problem of illicit drug use and its consequences.&quot;[27]
 The paper argues that there has been significant progress since
1979 in reducing casual use of illicit drugs -- from 24 million
to 12 million users -- and that prevention programs have played
a critical role.  
<P>
The National Structured Evaluation (NSE) of Alcohol and Other
Drug Abuse Prevention, sponsored by the Center for Substance Abuse
Prevention, recently concluded an analysis of hundreds of prevention
efforts.  The NSE found that effective programs emphasize personal
skill development, provide social sanctions and rewards that discourage
drug use and for adolescents at risk, provide professional individual
and family counseling.
<P>
 According to the NSE, there are seven typical prevention approaches.[28]
<UL>
<LI>Positive decisionmaking:  Helps develop personal skills for
preadolescent children.  It is in a quarter of all programs and
is a common school-based program.
<LI>Safety/health skills:  The least common, it provides skills
development and drug lectures.
<LI>Psychosocial skills:  Focuses on personal skill development
without fact-based drug lectures.  Accounts for 10 percent of
the programs.
<LI>Counseling intensive:  Provides individual and family intervention
and drug information.  Accounts for 10 percent of the programs.
<LI>Case management:  Focuses on individual needs to include health
care and addiction counseling.  Accounts for 7 percent of the
programs.
<LI>Multidirectional:  Combines many activities, personal skills
development, skills training, drug information lectures, and alternative
drug-free recreation.  Accounts for 13 percent of the programs.
<LI>Environmental change:  Provides training, changes law or enforcement
patterns, and alters the physical setting.  Accounts for one-third
of the programs.
</UL>
<P>
<center><h3>DRUG PREVENTION PROGRAMS</h3></center>
<P>
The Federal Government funds and oversees drug prevention through
efforts like the Department of Education's Safe and Drug-Free
Schools and Communities Program.   One of the best known is Project
D.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse Resistance Education).  
<P>
DARE is distinctive because of its widespread adoption nationwide;
its use of uniformed policemen teaching in local schools; and
its local control.  
<P>
DARE was created in 1983 by the Los Angeles Police Department
for grades K-12.  It uses a core curriculum consisting of 17 hour-long
weekly lessons, usually offered in 45- to 60-minute blocks.  DARE
focuses on teaching skills to resist social pressures to use drugs,
making decisions, building self-esteem, and choosing healthy alternatives
to drug use.  The programs for high school students address additional
topics like conflict resolution, gang prevention, parent education,
and after-school recreation.
<P>
The Research Triangle Institute (RTI) in cooperation with the
National Institute of Justice studied DARE's effectiveness.  Their
study found that DARE is popular and that many DARE  coordinators
plan to expand the program.  Many districts without the program
want to adopt it.
<P>
But RTI's meta-analysis found that DARE does not reduce drug use
despite its success in increasing student knowledge about substance
abuse and enhancing their social skills.[29]  William Midzelski, a
U.S. Department of Education drug education specialist, said,
&quot;It's well established that DARE doesn't work.&quot;[30]
<P>
Phyllis Ellickson, a Rand Corporation researcher, states, &quot;DARE
has a following and sales force that is extremely powerful in
fighting for scarce resources.  But its growth is totally out
of scale to its effectiveness.&quot;[31]
<P>
The Drug Policy Foundation (DPF) hosted a conference in Washington,
D.C. in November 1994.  A seminar entitled &quot;Truth or DARE&quot;
featured two activist parents critiquing DARE.  Richard Evans
of  Northhampton, Massachusetts, says DARE does not define drug
abuse and relies on values clarification.  According to Evans,
teachers like DARE because it gives them a free hour each week.
 Local police like DARE because it gets them into the lives of
children.  And politicians like DARE because it makes them look
like they are doing something.
<P>
The other DPF panelist was Steve Wallace of Chapel Hill, North
Carolina, who complained that DARE officers scare kids.  He said
that DARE consumes $600 to $700 million each year but doesn't
help children learn.
<P>
Despite the fact that the program has demonstrated limited success,
DARE has many supporters.  Glenn Levant, DARE's executive director,
states, &quot;Scientists will tell you bumble bees can't fly,
but we know they can.&quot;  Steve Rusiniak, a youth-bureau detective
in Wayne, New Jersey who has taught DARE classes for three years
states, &quot;I do know, because I've heard back from many kids
and their families, that DARE has established a good rapport.
 DARE has done something.  I'm not claiming that DARE is the answer,
but it's part of it.&quot;[32]
<P>
Less publicized prevention programs have shown promising results.
 Project Smart, founded in 1981, teaches children to resist peer
pressure, to interpret advertisements for alcohol and cigarettes,
and to practice saying no to drugs through role playing.[33]
<P>
Drug Strategies president Mathea Falco touts the successes of
Project Star.  She claims in her 1992 book, <I>The Making of a
Drug-Free America,</I> that there was a 30 percent drop
in drug abuse among adolescents in a Kansas City test.[34]
<P>
High-Scope curriculum advocates claim that 70 percent of their
inner city graduates stay away from drug dealing compared to peers
who hadn't participated.  This program includes a weekly 90-minute
home visit from counselors who focus on teaching parents how to
parent.[35]
<P>
The Archdiocese Drug Abuse Prevention Program (ADAP) is based
in the Bronx.  The curriculum focuses on group prevention counseling.
 According to executive director Sally Ann Shields, &quot;Information
does not change behavior.  It's the development of skills and
the relationships with counselors [that change behavior].&quot;[36]
<P>
ADAP is recognized by the federal government's Center for Substance
Abuse Prevention (CSAP) as one of the nation's best prevention
programs.  ADAP claims that 91 percent of participants significantly
reduced or eliminated drug and alcohol use and 79 percent of the
adolescents improved their grades and behavior at school.[37]
<P>
The President's National Drug Control Strategy states, &quot;America's
faith community can play an important role in finding solutions
to the related issues of drugs and violence.&quot;[38]  In fact, ONDCP
has called for a meeting of faith community leaders before the
end of 1995.
<P>
Religion-based drug treatment and prevention programs have been
especially successful.  Freddy Garcia, an ex-addict, has spent
the last 30 years helping inner city children fight drug addiction.
 He claims a 60 percent success rate using teaching on marriage
and the family, practical Christian living, Biblical counseling
skills, and love.  His staff includes ex-addicts, because, as
Garcia says, &quot;The man who has come back from the precipice
can best show others the way.&quot;  Garcia's &quot;Victory Mission&quot;
has 60 branches and has treated over 13,000 substance abusers.[39]
<P>
U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich named Garcia to a citizens' group
to recommend solutions to problems like poverty, crime, substance
abuse, and teen sex.  He said of Garcia, &quot;Freddy Garcia has
achieved results that are almost unheard of ... rather than studying
him, all too often the bureaucracy has tried to put folks like
Freddy out of business because they don't have a Ph.D. or they
don't fill out the paperwork right.&quot;[40]
<P>
Teen Challenge is a religion-based drug treatment and prevention
program that claims that 86 percent of individuals who go through
their program remain drug free.[41]  The basic philosophy is, &quot;We
believe that sincere faith in Christ is the motivation needed
to extract the deep-rooted symptoms that cause dependence on narcotics.&quot;
[42]
<P>
Characteristics shared by successful programs include parental
involvement, knowledge of drugs and their dangers, positive social
activities, positive role models, rewards and recognition for
youth interests, and an overall caring and supportive environment
in communities with integrated health, social service, and educational
systems.
<P>
<center><h3>THE FUTURE OF DRUG PREVENTION</h3></center>
<P>
The Oakland, California based &quot;Just Say No&quot; International
called on the Clinton Administration to look at youth drug-abuse
prevention as an economic issue as well as a social health issue.
 It found that over one-third of America's youth are at risk of
succumbing to drug use.[43]
<P>
Volunteer chairman and Hewlett-Packard executive Jack Brigham
cites his organization's survey of 6,404 youth educators, administrators
and other service providers, stating, &quot;The survey findings
confirm that youth drug-abuse prevention must be viewed by the
federal government not only as a social health issue, but as an
economic issue critical to the long-term economic health of this
nation.&quot;[44]
<P>
But Shirley Higgins, a communication specialist with the anti-drug
organization InTouch, told Speaker Newt Gingrich in a recent letter,
&quot;While the federal government has a vital role to play, we
have got to stop engaging in the fantasy that the federal government
can rescue us from our addictions, our community apathy where
it exists, our lack of self-responsibility and our lack of a vision
of a future that goes beyond the next five years.&quot;[45]
<P>
The Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education (PRIDE) subscribes
to three basic beliefs with regard to any future solution.  First,
it believes that parents have a strong instinct to protect their
children.  All we need to do is help parents to understand the
harmful effects of drugs, understand their child's social pressures
and help them develop an action plan.[46]
<P>
Second, our youth have a &quot;goodness of heart&quot; or a deep
care and concern for their peers.  We must help young people by
forming positive peer groups.  Finally, there is a contingent
of adults in every neighborhood.  These adults must be brought
together to network their resources and battle the scourge of
drugs.[47]
<P>
<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>
<P>
The drug debate should be an issue in the 1996 presidential campaign.
National leaders, public and private, must help rein in insidious
cultural influences and government must increase -- not ease up
-- pressure on drug traffickers.  It must also abandon &quot;feel
good&quot; strategies and embrace drug prevention programs that
work.

<h2>GLOBALONEY, FAMILY STYLE:<br>
THE UNITED NATIONS WORLD SUMMIT FOR<br>
SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT TAKES ON THE FAMILY</h2>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>
What follows is a commentary on the &quot;Draft Declaration and
Draft Programme of Action&quot; prepared by United Nations staff
for the &quot;World Summit for Social Development&quot; scheduled to
occur in Copenhagen March 6-12, 1995.  This commentary is indicative
of problems found in the document, which runs some 55 pages in
typescript, and which addresses, in generally broad language,
a wide range of social issues and concerns in member countries
of the United Nations.  This commentary will be updated after
Copenhagen to discuss the final language of the Declaration and
Programme of Action.    
<P>
<center><h3>INTRODUCTION</h3></center>
<P>
Following the United Nations and its swamp of commissions, declarations,
and conferences can be a debilitating experience.  The situation
is compounded by the rapidly growing basket of UN documents and
observances devoted to such topics as the family (International
Year of the Family, 1994), population and development (International
Conference on Population and Development, 1994), social development
(World Summit for Social Development, 1995), and women (Fourth
World Conference on Women, 1995).    
<P>
Thematically and administratively separate, these observances
and conferences tend to overlap in subject matter.  This is due
in part to the ambiguity of mission in many UN agencies and documents,
and the tendency of recent UN meetings to produce &quot;smorgasbord&quot;
documents that say in 1,000 words what more succinct documents
(like those of the American founding) say in 10.  Thus, for example,
the bitter dispute over abortion at the ICPD in Cairo in 1994
is likely to be reprised at the Beijing women's conference and
its preliminary meetings.              
<P>
An additional factor promoting these disputes is the continued
presence and agitation within the UN structure of international
lobbies (some with economic ties to the UN, and others privately
funded) devoted to particular agendas.  The United Nations Charter
(for example, Chapter X, Article 71, relating to the Economic
and  Social Council) makes specific provision for consultation
by the UN and its constituent councils and agencies &quot;with
nongovernmental organizations [NGOs] which are concerned with
matters within its competence.&quot;  
<P>
The Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) is responsible for conducting
all events in connection with the World Summit for Social Development.
<P>
NGOs vary in the amount and type of energy they devote to UN activities.
 Essentially, they  are private, charitable (i.e., tax exempt)
or advocacy organizations that are accredited by the UN  to lobby
at particular conferences and the preparatory meetings leading
up to them.  In the context of Cairo and Beijing, NGOs such as
the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF)  and the
Women's Environmental and Developmental Organization (WEDO) have
exerted continuous pressure, with considerable internal UN support,
for the drafting of documents that  strongly endorse abortion,
the redefinition of the family, and other radical causes.    
<P>
Preparatory meetings leading up to designated international conferences
are called, in UN lingo, &quot;prepcoms.&quot;  Major prepcoms
for both the Cairo population conference and the Beijing women's
summit have been held months in advance at the United Nations
headquarters in New York.  The prepcoms are run by &quot;Preparatory
Committees,&quot; composed of representatives of member nations
of the UN.  In between sessions of the prepcom, the Committee
chairman, with  the assistance of the UN Secretariat, may be tasked
with such responsibilities as the drafting of  declarations and
programmes of action.  The periods between prepcoms are invaluable,
especially to New Yorkbased NGOs, as opportunities to lobby UN
officials and to influence the development of conference documents.
<P>
With respect to the World Summit for Social Development, a second
session of the prepcom  was held in New York from August 22 to
September 2, 1994.  At that session, the committee  tasked its
chairman to prepare a declaration for consideration in Copenhagen.
 The UN Secretariat was charged by the committee to prepare a
programme of action for Copenhagen.  The analysis that follows
discusses the draft declaration and programme of action of November
22, 1994, as prepared by the chairman and the Secretariat.  As
of this writing, a final draft is in the process of  being completed
for submission to the summit in Copenhagen.    
<P>
That the United Nations is an incessant document mill has become
increasingly obvious.  The  November 22 draft, as discussed below,
incorporates a wealth of vague and contradictory ideas,  not the
least of which is the situational irony of a massive United Nations
bureaucracy proclaiming itself the savior of decentralized government.
 But, the question may be asked, are not most UN documents merely
recommendations, without the force of law?  Indeed, the design
of the  Economic and Social Council announced in the UN Charter
is precisely that of a body constituted to hold meetings and make
recommendations.  Article 62 defines the powers of ECOSOC as 
follows:                 
<P>
1.  The Economic and Social Council may make or initiate studies
and reports with respect to international economic, social, cultural,
educational, health, and related matters and may make recommendations
with respect to any such matters to the General Assembly, to the
Members of the United Nations, and to the specialized (UN) agencies
concerned.                  
<P>
2.  [ECOSOC] may make recommendations for the purpose of promoting
respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms
for all.                  
<P>
3.  [ECOSOC] may prepare draft conventions for submission to the
General Assembly ...      
<P>
4.  [ECOSOC] may call, in accordance with rules prescribed by
the United Nations, international conferences on matters falling
within its competence.  This brief Article summarizes the activity
of the ECOSOC with respect to the World Summit  for Social Development
 with one exception.  That is, none of the documents of the Summit
 amount to a convention, a legal instrument that requires the
approval of the General Assembly  and the submission to members
states for ratification.  Examples of such conventions are the
Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention for the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.  It
is important to realize that the language developed at Copenhagen
for its nonbinding declaration and programme of action will thereby
acquire momentum within the UN system, and perhaps form the basis
for future conventions with potentially legally binding force.
<P>
<center><h3>WEDO AND THE GLEN COVE CONCLAVE</h3></center>
<P>
It is this possibility that motivates the activities of the most
intensely involved NGOs, such as  the Women's Environmental and
Development Organization (WEDO).  Former Democratic Congresswoman
Bella Abzug, a privatecitizen member of the US delegation to the
Cairo population conference, is the leader of WEDO.  An uncompromising
feminist and abortion advocate, Abzug  represented WEDO at a November
29 to December 2, 1994 planning meeting for the Beijing women's
conference.  This global strategy meeting was held in Glen Cove,
New York.  While  focused primarily on Beijing, the meeting included
working groups focused on devising strategies and language for
the whole basket of UN conferences and documents in progress.
 In that context, many of its recommendations are instructive.
<P>
The Glen Cove working group on the Copenhagen document criticized
it for its focus &quot;on the  family as the basic unit&quot;
of society, and for overlooking &quot;the changing configuration
of the  family.&quot;  The working group called for women's housework
to be remunerated, for a &quot;universal  adequate annual guaranteed
income,&quot; and &quot;payment for childcare.&quot;  It also
called for the adoption of a tax on &quot;international financial
transactions&quot; and &quot;taxation of transnational corporations&quot;
to  finance social development, presumably under UN auspices.
 (In this regard, the November 22 Copenhagen draft recommends
that the General Assembly task the ECOSOC to study such  proposals.)
<P>
The working group proposed a number of changes to the Copenhagen
draft (See full text of  the November 22 draft in the Appendix).
 The changes include a subtle call for changes in electoral systems
to establish a &quot;mechanism for women's ... equitable representation
at all levels of  the political process.&quot;  Other language
developed at Glen Cove suggests this &quot;mechanism&quot; would
 include gender quotas for public office.  In addition, the working
group proposed that the  Copenhagen document ensure &quot;that
effective laws and agencies exist to prevent and eliminate  discrimination
on the basis of gender [and] sexual orientation ...&quot;; &quot;that
women and adolescents  have access to good quality, comprehensive
health care, including the full range of reproductive  and sexual
health care services, including access to safe abortion ...&quot;;
and that the draft's  language regarding &quot;family as the basic
unit of society&quot; be replaced with references to &quot;households
and families&quot; as &quot;important economic units.&quot;  
<P>
The Glen Cove working group recommendations for Beijing are also
revealing.  The group  called for the &quot;recognition of sexual
orientation as a fundamental human right within the context  of
the expanding definition of the family.&quot;  It also called
for &quot;sexual and reproductive education to [sic] boys and
girls&quot;; affirmative action to assure that &quot;governments
... achieve 50% representation in elected and appointed office
by women by the year 2005,&quot; to be achieved by &quot;setting
 targets or quota systems&quot;; and encouraging &quot;activities
aimed at changing traditional decisionmaking roles in the family.&quot;
 One specific action recommended by the working group is that
the UN Secretariat prepare a &quot;gender balance rating card&quot;
to be published at the beginning of each session of the General
Assembly &quot;rating and ranking Member States on the basis of
numbers, positions, titles, race and ethnicity of women participating
in their Missions to [the] UN ...&quot;      
<P>
Other working groups dealt with the aftermath of the Cairo population
conference and discussed ways to expand the advances made in promoting
the notion of &quot;reproductive health and  decisionmaking&quot;
as aspects of fundamental human rights, including possibly adolescents
and  single people.  The goal remains to assure that abortion
is included in future UN documents &quot;as a  basic method of
fertility regulation and as an essential part of reproductive
health services and  rights.&quot;    
<P>
Finally, Working Group 2 at Glen Cove developed a program of lobbying
and other activities  to be undertaken between the Copenhagen
and Beijing meetings.  The program is entitled the  &quot;Women's
Global Campaign, 180 Days, 180 Ways.&quot;  The campaign's goal
is to extend the statements of belief and programs of action of
the Glen Cove coalition to a wider network of women,  NGOs and
&quot;disenfranchised people.&quot;  Expanded usage of online
computer networks is  envisioned.  All of this is in keeping with
a recognition that the topdown organization of social  movements
by such bodies as the United Nations are doomed to failure if
it cannot enlist the  support of a grassroots movement in member
nations.                                      
<P>
The Glen Cove conclave amounted to a gathering of radical feminists
rebuffed politically in the  United States but rewarded in the
closed environment of New York and the United Nations,  funded
and supported by a variety of such populist funding sources as
the Ford, and Rockefeller  Foundations, and abetted by the swelling
throng of UN and Clinton Administration bureaucrats  dedicated
to adopting the sexual revolution on a global scale.  With each
new UN conference and  document, they have another opportunity
to move the international clock in the direction of their  Brave
New World.    
<P>
<center><h3>ANALYSIS OF NOVEMBER 22 COPENHAGEN DRAFT</h3></center>
<P>
All page numbers refer to the November 22, 1994 draft declaration
and &quot;programme of  action.&quot;  The actual text of the
draft declaration reviewed begins on page 3 and concludes at page
 55.  Most paragraphs in the declaration are identifiable by numbers
or letter designations in the  text, and these designations are
used in this commentary.  Language that is objectionable is  indicated
by brackets [ ].  Language to be added or substituted for objectionable
language is indicated in bold.    
<P>
Suggested modifications follow.    
<P>
Page 3, paragraph 2.  Modify line two to read &quot;profound social
problems specially poverty,  unemployment, family breakup and
social exclusion.&quot;  The phenomenon of family dissolution
is  a virtually universal concomitant of development; indeed,
it is especially pronounced in the most highly developed nations
as individuals tend to supplant family (agrarian) units as the
primary  sources of production.  Asserting the problem of family
breakup at the outset of the document  will serve to buttress
family preservation as an essential component of development throughout
 the declaration.    
<P>
Page 3, paragraph 4.  &quot;Peace and security&quot; are insufficient
descriptors of national aspirations.   This paragraph should be
modified to read &quot;the achievement and maintenance of conditions
of  freedom, peace and security with and between ... cannot be
attained in the absence of conditions of freedom, peace and security.&quot;
 This language is needed to express the basic condition  of political
freedom as the key to economic and human progress.  Conditions
of &quot;peace and  security,&quot; at least in the military sense,
prevailed in Soviet Russia and numerous authoritarian  regimes
of East Asia, Africa, and the Americas.  Peace and security alone
are insufficient conditions for human wellbeing and development.
<P>
Page 4, paragraph 11, line 2.  The word &quot;contradiction&quot;
should be modified to read &quot;contrast.&quot;  This distinction
may not carry over well in other languages besides English, but
it is important that the document not be read to assert that in
every case the expansion of prosperity occurs for some at the
expense of the poverty of others.   All wealth is not the product
of exploitation.  Were it so, development by definition would
be a zero sum game in which no real improvement in overall global
living standards is possible.  The declaration must reject this
notion in principle. &quot;Contrast&quot; better suggests the
morally troubling existence of stark inequities in the distribution
of the world's basic resources.    
<P>
Page 4, paragraph 12, line 3,  The word &quot;people&quot; or
&quot;peoples&quot; appears to be missing after  &quot;Globalization
also permits.&quot;    
<P>
Page 4, paragraph 14, subparagraph a, line 2, add the following
language:  &quot;the gap between rich and poor, aggravated by
cultural factors and social mores, has increased.&quot;  This
addition recognizes that the economic gap between rich and poor
is not purely an economic phenomenon. In the United States, for
example, families headed by a single parent are five times more
likely to be poor than are families headed by two parents.  Casual
attitudes regarding divorce and sexual activity outside of marriage
have fueled these inequities.    
<P>
Page 6, paragraph (h).  Language is needed here to suggest, as
economically as possible, that &quot;family,&quot; while expressed
in different cultural and legal terms in many countries, nonetheless
has an archetypal and crosscultural meaning.  If we can speak
of &quot;equity and equality&quot; between men and women at various
points in the document, we can also make clear that the family
is an archetypal arrangement of man and woman, and their offspring,
and others related to them by  blood, marriage and adoption. 
<P>
Page 7, paragraph 21.  This paragraph needs to be strengthened
to include recognition of due  principles of subsidiarity and
of the possibility that government, even when wellmeaning, may
 overreach and become the principal obstacle to the attainment
of development.  Thus, language  should be added which states:
 We acknowledge the [primary] special responsibility of  governments,
particularly those units of government closest to and most accountable
to the  people, to attain these goals.  We also acknowledge that
they cannot be achieved by government  alone, and that, indeed,
governments may hinder development by overinvolvement in and 
disruption of healthy social and economic activity.    
<P>
Page 8, commitment 2, subparagraph b.  Modify to read:  &quot;the
provision of primary health care  and the promotion of reproductive
health and voluntary and informed family planning for  married
couples, reinforcement of the social and legal significance of
the archetypal family unit, safe drinking water ...&quot;  Addition
of &quot;voluntary&quot; is necessary to affirm the right of couples
to reject the &quot;provision&quot; of family planning; reference
to the marital couple is a natural correlative  of the term &quot;family&quot;
in family planning.  The role of the dissolution of the family
in fostering  intractable poverty is described above.    
<P>
Page 8, commitment 2, subparagraph c.  &quot;access to land, credit&quot;
should be modified to read  &quot;opportunity to acquire land,
credit ...&quot;  The emphasis must be on expanded opportunities,
and  the United Nations should make clear that it is not endorsing
policies of expropriation and confiscation of lawfully acquired
and owned resources.                                        
<P>
Page 9, commitment 4, subparagraph a.  &quot;Promote basic values
of respect for pluralism and  diversity, tolerance and responsibility,
political and personal freedom, nonviolence and solidarity ...&quot;
<P>
Page 10, commitment 4, subparagraph e:  &quot;central role of
the archetypal family.&quot; 
<P>
Page 10, commitment 5, subparagraph b:  &quot;Establish policies
[objectives and measurable goals] to  enhance gender balance.&quot;
 This language clearly stipulates the formulation of quotas for
political representation of women, presumably created and enforced
by the United Nations and its instrumentalities.  As such, this
language is at war with the declaration's expressed commitment
to respect for national sovereignty and decentralization of developmental
initiatives.  Moreover, it is  false in principle.  The key to
equity and equality is opportunity.  Government policies should
 indeed guarantee such opportunities, and those governments that
do so will reap the richest rewards in diverse and freely chosen
representation.  Republican forms of government are incompatible
with quotas, and republican forms are precisely those that have
proven most resilient in  expanding political participation by
all citizens.    
<P>
Page 10, commitment 5, subparagraph c.  In this context, there
is no reason to exclude men from protections against &quot;exploitation,
abuse and violence.&quot;  Violence against entrepreneurs in the
 United States, for example, frequently takes the form of attacks
upon disfavored ethnic groups  engaged in lawful business activity
in the cities.  Prejudice and violence against citizens of foreign
extraction is also common in many countries.  Both of these types
of phenomena are severe hindrances to the development of small
enterprises in economically depressed communities.  The selective
nature of much of this violence against men certifies it as an
issue of equity and equality.  Therefore, the subparagraph should
read:  &quot;Take effective measures to eliminate all kinds of
 exploitation, abuse and violence against men and women, with
particular attention to  immigrants, [women] refugees, and [women]
noncombatants in situations of armed conflict.&quot;    
<P>
Page 10, commitment 5, subparagraph d.  &quot;Encourage the ratification,
[removal of reservations,]  and implementation of all provisions
...&quot;  The United Nations is to be expected to encourage the
 ratification of international instruments approved by the General
Assembly.  Reservations, however, are a critical mechanism by
which sovereign nations adduce understandings that protect  important
cultural and legal values and policies.  In this particular regard,
reservations in many  nations preserve understandings regarding
special protections for women and mothers, and for  their offspring,
born and unborn.  The language as written is once again at war
with the declaration's commitment to respect national sovereignty.
 It is intrusive and should be modified as noted.    
<P>
Page 11, subparagraph d.  &quot;Increase official development
assistance, both in total and for social  programs, without coercion
or reducing the resources allocated to other sectors.&quot;  This
language is needed to address the continuing problem of assistance
linkage:  the withholding or threatened withholding of assistance
funds from nations which do not conform national policies to donor
nation's preferences in such areas as population control.  Addition
of coercion or reinforces the declaration's commitment to national
sovereignty.    
<P>
Page 11, commitment 7, subparagraph a.  &quot;Protect basic social
programs and expenditures, in  particular, those affecting the
weakest and most vulnerable segments of society, from acrosstheboard
budget reductions, while eliminating inefficient spending and
perverse incentives against work and family formation, and increasing
the quality of social expenditures.&quot;    
<P>
Page 12, commitment 8, subparagraph d.  &quot;Ensure that taxation
systems are fair, [and] economically efficient, and nonpunitive,&quot;
<P>
Page 16, paragraph 4.  &quot;Social development is also clearly
linked to the development of peace, freedom, stability and security
...  to promote social development requires a reorientation of
values, objectives, and priorities, in order to strengthen or
reform existing institutions and  policies.  Human dignity, [equity]
equal opportunity, freedom  and social justice must be ...&quot;
 The rationale for each of these suggested changes is outlined
in similar contexts above.  Note that the strengthening of all
existing institutions should clearly not be the objective of the
United  Nations in this declaration.  Many national institutions,
both private and public are, in fact,  destructive of human wellbeing.
 The declaration itself calls for reform of multilateral lending
 policies to the most debtridden nations.  No one, for example,
should support strengthening of  the UNFPA, which has exhibited
warm relations with national governments employing population
policies deeply destructive of human life and human freedom. 
<P>
Page 16, paragraph 5.  &quot;This same global community is threatened
by environmental degradation, epidemics, various forms of intolerance,
attacks and stresses upon the archetypal family unit, sexual exploitation
and the drug trade, violence and criminality . . . &quot;    
<P>
Page 16, paragraph 7.  &quot;Gender equity and equality of opportunity
[and the full participation of  women] in all economic, social
and political activities is essential.&quot;  Besides being redundant
as  written, this phrase could be abused to discourage governmental
policies that protect full or parttime homemakers and that permit
them to freely choose the terms of their participation in  economic
and other activities.  The right of families to establish their
own patterns of workfamily  involvement must be affirmed.  Another
alternative here is to change the word &quot;full&quot; to &quot;open.&quot;
  Ask yourself this question:  which nation of the world has the
fullest participation of women in  economic activities?  Clearly,
it is the People's Republic of China, with its cadres and worker
 brigades.  Free nations typically exhibit much more diverse and
complex arrangements, with equality of opportunity guaranteed
and norms of participation left to individual and family choice
and capability.  This is the more socially just and free condition.
<P>
Page 17, bulleted items:  Add &quot;a strengthened role for the
archetypal family, churches and  private associations for selfbetterment;&quot;
and &quot;public policies that discourage illegal and/or  selfdestructive
behaviors that shorten lifespan and/or reduce productivity.&quot;
 The latter  language should be unexceptionable; it is aimed at
such practices as smoking, drug abuse, and  activities that transmit
HIV and other diseases.  The impact of these factors on human
lifespan, productivity, and development is clearly massive.  
 
<P>
Page 18, paragraph 11, add a subparagraph e:  Promoting the expansion
of political freedom in the context of transitions to market economies,
and directing development assistance to smallscale and private
ventures that maximize individual creativity and initiative. 
<P>
Page 19, paragraph 13, subparagraph e:  &quot;... and ensuring
that subsidy systems benefit people in  poverty, avoid incentives
to nonproductive lifestyles and family breakup, and reduce disparities.&quot;
As noted above, family breakup is a key determinant and perpetuator
of poverty; subsidy  (welfare) programs should avoid designs that
punish intact families and reward illegitimacy.    
<P>
Page 19, paragraph 13, subparagraph g:  &quot;Assisting developing
canters and countries in transition to establish efficient, nonpunitive
and fair tax collection systems.&quot;    
<P>
Page 20, paragraph 14, subparagraph a:  &quot;Ensuring that institutions
 public, private, and  natural, including the family unit  and
agencies responsible for the design and implementation ...&quot;
 This language eliminates any possible bias toward governmental
institutions as  opposed to private and natural institutions engaged
in critical social development, primarily the family, business,
and religious denominations.    
<P>
Page 20, paragraph 14, subparagraph b:  The phrase &quot;full
transparency ... for all ... private  institutions&quot; raises
important questions for private associations, including churches,
which are  generally accorded far more freedom of action than
governmental and quasigovernmental  institutions that operate
with public funds.  This subparagraph should be amended to include
 language respecting the privacy rights of voluntary and religious
institutions except insofar as  necessary to meet generally accepted
standards of accountability under the laws of each nation.   Without
such language, private institutions are vulnerable to treatment
as publicly owned entities.  Therefore, add &quot;Nothing in this
subparagraph shall be construed to diminish the right of  voluntary
and religious institutions to appropriate privacy protections
consistent with generally accepted standards of accountability
under the law.&quot;    
<P>
Page 20, paragraph 14, subparagraph c:  Throughout the document,
no attempt is made to define  &quot;discrimination&quot; or to
limit in any way its application to only those characteristics
of persons  rightly regarded as &quot;neutral&quot;   ethnicity,
national origin, creed, gender, disability, etc.  It may be  better
to leave this term undefined, on the presumption that prevailing
national policies, which  generally protect only neutral characteristics,
are what is meant.  Nonetheless, the recent action in the European
Parliament to protect homosexual partnerships, and US initiatives
to expand &quot;domestic partnership&quot; legislation offer some
argument for defining &quot;discrimination&quot; here to mean
only the protection of neutral characteristics.  Possible language:
 &quot;Eliminating de jure  discrimination, while [ developing]
encouraging educational programmes and media campaigns  aimed
at eliminating de facto discrimination against persons based on
race, sex, national  origin, religion, political affiliation,
disability, or other characteristics unrelated to character or
performance.    
<P>
Page 20, paragraph 14, subparagraph d:  [reflect better]  better
reflects    
<P>
Page 20, paragraph 14, subparagraph f:  &quot;Making political
and social processes inclusive of all  lawabiding members of society
...&quot;  Many nationstates exclude criminals from access to
certain political and social processes.  The phrase as written,
like much of the declaration, is  susceptible of widely varying
interpretation, but as written it appears open to abuse.  The
best course of action may be to delete the phrase &quot;inclusive
of all members of society and&quot;, since &quot;respecting political
pluralism and cultural diversity&quot; sufficiently describes
an open political  system.    
<P>
Page 20, paragraph 15, subparagraph c:  &quot;ensuring that all
obstacles to full equity and equality  between women and men are
removed in all private and public institutions of society.&quot;
 The  dangers in this language are obvious.  The United Nations
is hereby committing itself to eliminating anything it regards
as inequities between men and women in private institutions. 
If  churches and parachurch organizations are excepted from this
proscription, that fact is not  mentioned.  These issues have
created tremendous friction and debate in the United States and
 elsewhere in the developed world.  Most US &quot;equal rights&quot;
statutes have been limited in their  application to &quot;public
accommodations,&quot; a term which embraces many private institutions
that  hold themselves forward as open to the public, but excludes
those, such as churches and other  religiously affiliated institutions,
which impose membership requirements based on creed.  Most US
statutes, with one or two exceptions, also exempt private, nonpublicly
supported clubs and  associations (e.g., the Boy Scouts, the YMCA).
 This principle should be protected here.  &quot;Public accommodations&quot;
is not a term common to UN documents.  I recommend revision to
read &quot;all  [private and] public and publicly accessible institutions
of society&quot;.    
<P>
Page 21, paragraph 16, subparagraph a:  The language as written
suggests governmental  interference with the media to ensure socially
constructive attitudes.  The goal is laudable, but its implementation
by government is violative of free speech standards and guarantees.
 The purposes  of government in this regard are better served
by policies that encourage the development of a diverse body of
mass media.  Increasing the body of media voices, not stifling
an errant few, is a proper sphere for government action.  It is
akin to averting the growth of monopolies in the economic sphere.
 If language stating this objective cannot be obtained, change
&quot;Ensuring&quot; to  &quot;Encouraging&quot; to leave this
objective in the realm of the bully pulpit.    
<P>
Page 21, paragraph 16, subparagraph c:  &quot;including on gender,
family and cultural issues ...&quot;  The paragraph as written
is narrow and excludes needed improvements in data collection
on  issues of family structure and culture.  For example, international
data preliminarily examined by scholars at the American Enterprise
Institute suggests a close linkage between infant mortality and
 family structure.  Gender analysis is one of only many relevant
possible areas for improvement.    
<P>
Page 21, paragraph 17, subparagraph d:  &quot;... policies to
combat terrorism, organized crime,  sexual exploitation and drug
trafficking.&quot;  This additional language gives higher visibility
and  priority to efforts to combat the exploitation of minors
in South Asia and elsewhere around the  world where the international
sex and pornography trade are officially ignored or inadequately
 resisted.    
<P>
Page 22, paragraph 20:  The personal dimension of poverty is excluded
from this analysis of the  origins of poverty.  It is most easily
addressed by modifying the first sentence of the paragraph to
read &quot;and cultural and personal values.&quot;  Without more,
however, this entire section focuses too  heavily on &quot;political
and economic structures&quot; and too lightly on personality structures
such as  selfdiscipline, deferral of gratification, honesty and
hard work.  To address this problem, add  after &quot;those who
cannot support themselves&quot; the following: &quot;to foster
personal qualities of selfdiscipline, honesty, hard work, and
the deferral of gratification;&quot;    
<P>
Page 24, paragraph 26, subparagraph a:  The most important indicator
of poverty is family  structure.  This indicator must be added
to the litany of poverty and vulnerability indicators.    
<P>
Page 26, paragraph 29, subparagraph a:  Language should be added
to the phrase &quot;redistributing  land&quot; to bar expropriation
and confiscation of lawfully owned and managed property.  The
US  Constitution includes a &quot;takings clause,&quot; which
obliges government to compensate owners for  lawfully expropriated
or attached property.  Even in developed countries, this principle
is  irregularly and inadequately followed.  This paragraph should
read:  &quot;encouraging the  redistribution of [redistributing]
land where necessary to foster a return to productive use  and
where full compensation and other due process of law is guaranteed
to lawful owners.&quot;    
<P>
Page 26, paragraph 30, subparagraph a:  &quot;access of people
living in poverty to responsible levels  of credit ...&quot; 
The United Nations should not require any lending institution
to make irresponsible  loans.  In fact, the declaration's clear
and repeated call for debt restructuring and forgiveness for 
developing nations dramatizes the fact that irresponsible lending
that ignores economic viability damages both the lending institution
and the dependent party.  This experience must be applied to micro
as well as macroeconomics.    
<P>
Page 26, paragraph 30, subparagraph c:  &quot;Providing incentives
for [, earmarking percentages of  the lending base].  In line
with the criticism noted above, lending institutions must retain,
for the sake of their depositors as well as the wellbeing of borrowers,
reasonable standards of viability and repayability for all loans
in their portfolio.  Encouraging lenders to provide responsible
levels  of credit to impoverished persons for socially valuable
purposes is a laudable aim, but setasides  and quotas can only
encourage distortions in the loan market and the placement of
irresponsible  loans.  This will not alleviate poverty and may,
in fact, hinder normal patterns of development.    
<P>
Page 27, paragraph 32, subparagraph b:  The phrase &quot;full
and equal access&quot; to health services  suggests that the same
standards of service that apply to women should apply to girls.
 The  implication is that services to be provided are identical
irrespective of maturity, marital status, or other factors.  Add
at the end of this sentence, &quot;with due regard for the responsibility
of  government to protect the vulnerability of the immature and
the sanctuary of the family.&quot;    
<P>
Page 28, paragraph 33, add a new subparagraph i, and adjust the
following subparagraph accordangle:  &quot;Encouraging the formation
and retention of stable family units, as a shield against poverty,
the appropriate locus for sexual expression, childbearing and
childrearing, and the essential factor in successful education
and the creation of productive and responsible  citizens.&quot;
<P>
Page 28, paragraph 34, subparagraph c:  The antagonism, in some
nations, between formal and  nonformal education for preschoolers
should be acknowledged.  To some extent, these objectives can
be mutually exclusive.  Numerous education experts believe that
nonformal education  within the family is significantly healthier
and more effective than early formal education before a child
is emotionally or psychologically ready to learn.  The best way
to address this concern is to add the word voluntary before &quot;preschool
education&quot; to assure that mandates do not drive out parental
education of young children in the home. 
<P>
Page 29, paragraph 34, subparagraph d:  Same changes as recommended
for Page 8, commitment 2, subparagraph b.    
<P>
Page 29, paragraph 34, subparagraph e:  Removing objectionable
language in this context may  prove impossible.  I recommend instead
that language be added to encourage the provision of  health care
to expectant mothers and the children they carry that will enable
them to carry those  children successfully to term.  &quot;Safe
motherhood&quot; must be made to be synonymous with safety for
 both mother and child  this is logical because, without the child,
it is not motherhood at all. The strategy of proabortion organizations
at Cairo was to move away from an individual conception  of maternal
health that focuses on the health of every motherandchild in utero
toward a collective, public healthoriented concept that denies
the need to protect the health of mother and child in all circumstances.
 This is one occasion where the faulty language in the declaration
can be improved by making it truly universal, i.e., protective
of all mothers and children.  Amend this language to read &quot;full
access to such services, including voluntary and informed reproductive
health/family planning care for married couples [and], education
on safe motherhood, and  supportive services for all expectant
mothers and the children they carry, [and prenatal and postnatal
care] both prenatally and postnatally.    
<P>
Page 29, paragraph 35, subparagraph e.  &quot;Expanding and strengthening
social insurance   programmes and tax policies to protect working
people ...&quot;  Burdensome taxation can subject  working families
to poverty.  Recently the United States reformed a program called
the Earned  Income Tax Credit to provide additional income to
lift working families above the poverty line.   Broadly considered,
this is a &quot;social insurance&quot; programme, but the key
is that it is based on an  alleviation of taxation on the working
family, not the direct imposition of a tax on families or  other
entities.   
<P>
Page 30, paragraph 36, subparagraph d:  &quot;Improving the status
of the single parent in society&quot; is  opposed to policies
that responsibly discourage the deliberate choice of single parenthood
or  sexual irresponsibility.  Assisting single parents to care
for their child is generally sound policy,  but even here society
gains nothing by refusing to recognize that promotion of adoption
is the  better alternative for many single mothers.  To avoid
these notional difficulties, amend this  subparagraph to read:
[&quot;Improving the status of the single parent in society and]
Ensuring that  singleparent families receive the social support
they need, include support for adequate housing and the child
care of their choice, with special emphasis on incentives for
marriage and  strengthening extended family networks.&quot;  
<P>
Page 32, paragraph 43, bullet one:  The &quot;full participation
of employers and trade unions&quot;  excludes the vast majority
of the world's workers.  Add &quot;nonunionized workers&quot;
to this phrase.    
<P>
Page 34, paragraph 46, add a subparagraph g:  &quot;Establishing
policies to encourage invention and entrepreneurship, to protect
the products of invention and entrepreneurship from  misappropriation,
and to provide inventors and entrepreneurs with access to capital
and  economic rewards sufficient to encourage the development
and introduction of new technologies and methods.&quot;  Much
technological development takes place outside &quot;national and
local technology institutions; indeed, the home computer revolution
was largely sparked by the  technical wizardry of two Americans
working out of a garage.  Assurance of economic rewards,  protection
of copyrights and patents, and access to capital are as or more
critical than support for technology institutions as a means to
promote employmentintensive growth.  Experience demonstrates that
governments cannot always predict, produce, or judge which technologies
will have the most profound impact in promoting economic growth
and human betterment.    
<P>
Page 34, paragraph 47, subparagraph d:  Revise to read &quot;increasing
family benefits and social  support such as equitable and substantial
financial support for all forms of child care, including care
at home.       
<P>
Page 38, paragraph 55, subparagraph d.  This paragraph is a glaring
demonstration of the  irreconcilability of the declaration's claimed
dedication to sovereignty and its clear commitment to utilize
United Nations instrumentalities to change attitudes toward the
division of paid labor and housework!  Many families around the
world obviously do not wish their attitudes to be changed.  They
believe explicitly in the social and childrearing advantages of
a single wageearner  structure.  They have no wish to impose those
structure on all peoples and families around the globe.  They
adopt such patterns as sequencing in which a primary caregiver,
usually the mother, leaves the paid labor force to devote herself
fulltime to the care of her family, only to return to paid labor
as the children enter formal schooling or are fully grown.  That
the United Nations would seek to use its resources to foster the
destruction of such patterns is reprehensible, but it will also
ultimately be futile.  This language is a retreaded version of
the most doctrinaire  feminism that is losing popularity even
in the most advanced nations.  If language of any kind is  needed,
it should state only &quot;Devising public policies that support
maximum family choice and empowerment over questions of parental
division of labor.&quot;  The reference to &quot;child care  facilities&quot;
appears to favor the least popular form of child care in the United
States, i.e.,  institutional child care.  This phrase should be
modified to read, as above, support for all forms  of child care,
including home care and family care.  The phrase profamily tax
relief should  also be added to this litany of workfamily policies,
as this issue transcends all the others in  promoting family freedom.
 Other objections could be raised to this paragraph, but these
are the  major ones.    
<P>
Page 38, paragraph 55, subparagraph e.  On the scale of public
values, encouraging fathers and  mothers to stay together is far
more important than using atomic scales to measure gender  equality
in diaperchanging and other domestic duties.  Nearly all studies
of child care issues point out that most parents would prefer
to have one or both working parents spend more time with their
children, if loss of income were not an issue.  The point is that
all of these subparagraphs ignore parental choice and parental
preferences and subordinate them to the goal of encouraging women
to take paid employment.  Other than ideology, it is not clear
why this should be so.  This  paragraph should be replaced with
one that reads:  Encouraging governments to recognize the unique
contributions of families with children and to adopt policies
that maximize parental time spent in childrearing activities and
minimize the need for families to spend inordinate time in paid
labor activities at the expense of overall family wellbeing. 
The goal here is to encourage at least some form of a family wage
system that leaves each parent's role as the parents mutually
agree.  Parttime, flexible, and home working schedules promote
this result, as well.    
<P>
Page 41, paragraph 64, add to the last bullet item listed:  &quot;violence,
crime, drug abuse and  trafficking, sexual exploitation, and other
behaviors that diminish productivity, shorten lifespan and spread
disease.  This language is needed to assure that &quot;respect
for diversity&quot; does not  include respect for actions that
involve a dimension of personal immorality.  &quot;Diversity&quot;
properly means neutral differences, not moral disputes about issues
of character.    
<P>
Page 41, paragraph 66, subparagraph c:  Revise to read &quot;Giving
community organizations,  private associations and natural institutions
like the family greater control . . .&quot;                  
<P>
Page 42, paragraph 67, subparagraph a:  The phrase &quot;as appropriate&quot;
may suffice to address  concern about the overextension of prohibitions
on discrimination to distinctly moral categories. Marriage laws
currently &quot;discriminate&quot; against samegender pairs. 
Enacting legislation to  reverse this situation would be inappropriate,
but it may be wiser to nail this down with some  effort to define
unacceptable discrimination.  Note the language at page 40, paragraph
59 that  comes close to defining the scope of acceptable prohibitions
on discrimination:  &quot;different groups which are defined by
language, ethnicity, religion, geography or class.&quot;  This
internal definition  may offer a route to an acceptably limited
definition of discrimination, with the addition of gender and
disability.    
<P>
Page 42, paragraph 67, subparagraph b:  [removal of reservations],
for the reasons noted above.    
<P>
Page 45, paragraph 71, subparagraph a:  In many places in the
declaration, the emphasis on the  elimination of violence against
certain groups in society (armed conflict, for example) is culturally
true and entirely appropriate.  Here it is mystifying.  Young
males are disproportionately the victims of homicide (at the hands
of other young males, in most cases) in developed countries, including
the United States.  On the general issue of social violence, thereis
absolutely no need for gender oneupmanship.  The United Nations
should never jettison concern for violence against young men,
who are among the most pathetic victims of family breakup in advanced
societies.  I recommend ending the first sentence of this paragraph
as follows, &quot;with particular attention to vulnerable persons
who are the most frequent victims of violent acts.&quot;  Crime
and violence are pervasive enough that they should never be turned
into mere group politics.    
<P>
Page 47.  Nearly every word on this page illustrates the tension
in this document between its  repeated pledges to respect and
promote &quot;decentralization,&quot; government &quot;closest
to the people,&quot;  &quot;national sovereignty,&quot; &quot;small
business entrepreneurs&quot; and &quot;grassroots/community organizations.&quot;
   As national strategies are here designed, &quot;priorities
and time frames&quot; are the responsibility of national governments.
 &quot;Massive political will to invest in people&quot; is required
to achieve these goals.  All of this is &quot;primarily the responsibility
of national Governments.&quot;  The declaration does not strive
to reconcile these contradictory themes and objectives.  In small
nationstates, national Governments may in fact be close to the
people.  In large nations, they are remote, and the general direction
of policy reform is running counter to central government solutions.
 The declaration's only attempt to resolve this problem is to
include language at various points that expresses all points of
view.  The irony of the United nations amassing resources and
summoning political will to promote local solutions ought not
to miss anyone's attention.  There are far too many problems with
this page to fix it, but it is probably the clearest expression
yet of the authors' actual intent in devising the programme of
action.    
<P>
Page 48, paragraph 75, prologue:  Include family counseling and
assistance among the spheres  of work done by NGOs.          
<P>
Page 49, paragraph 76, subparagraph f:  This paragraph includes
the first reference in the  document to &quot;debate&quot; about
the direction of social policy.  The rest of the declaration could
be  improved by correcting this omission and recognizing that
the most progressive nations are those that have the most debate
about all of the issues covered by the document.    
<P>
Page 50, paragraph 77, subparagraph a:  add nonpunitive before
&quot;taxes&quot;; add at the end or that  provide incentives
for selfdefeating and selfdestructive behaviors.    
<P>
Page 52, paragraph 82.  This paragraph broaches the possibility
of vesting the United Nations  with taxing authority.  This idea
is only surfaced here, but its philosophical implications are
 profound.  It raises the possibility that the United Nations
Economic and Social Council will take on the characteristics of
an extralateral, rather than multilateral institution.  Such a
mechanism  would inevitably diminish individual nations' role
in managing and overseeing the development of  United Nations
policy.  This paragraph deserves wide publicity and debate now.
 Similar concerns are raised by the references to international
taxation and involuntary financing of the United  Nations at paragraphs
85 b and 86 g.
