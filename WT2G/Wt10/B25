OPINION
<P>
SPROUSE, Senior Circuit Judge:
<P>
George Mason University appeals from a summary judgment granted
by the district court to the IOTA XI Chapter of Sigma Chi Fraternity
(FN1) in its action for declaratory judgment and an injunction
seeking to nullify sanctions imposed on it by the University because
it conducted an &quot;ugly woman contest&quot; with racist and
sexist overtones. We affirm.
<P>
I
<P>
Sigma Chi has for two years held an annual &quot;Derby Days&quot;
event, planned and conducted both as entertainment and as a source
of funds for donations to charity. The &quot;ugly woman contest,&quot;
held on April 4, 1991, was one of the &quot;Derby Days&quot; events.
The Fraternity staged the contest in the cafeteria of the student
union. As part of the contest, eighteen Fraternity members were
assigned to one of six sorority teams cooperating in *388 the
events. The involved Fraternity members appeared in the contest
dressed as caricatures of different types of women, including
one member dressed as an offensive caricature of a black woman.
He was painted black and wore stringy, black hair decorated with
curlers, and his outfit was stuffed with pillows to exaggerate
a woman's breasts and buttocks. He spoke in slang to parody African-Americans.
<P>
There is no direct evidence in the record concerning the subjective
intent of the Fraternity members who conducted the contest. The
Fraternity, which later apologized to the University officials
for the presentation, conceded during the litigation that the
contest was sophomoric and offensive.
<P>
Following the contest, a number of students protested to the University
that the skit had been objectionably sexist and racist. Two hundred
forty-seven students, many of them members of the foreign or minority
student body, executed a petition, which stated: &quot;[W]e are
condemning the racist and sexist implications of this event in
which male members dressed as women. One man in particular wore
a black face, portraying a negative stereotype of black women.&quot;
<P>
On April 10, 1991, the Dean for Student Services, Kenneth Bumgarner,
discussed the situation with representatives of the objecting
students. That same day, Dean Bumgarner met with student representatives
of Sigma Chi, including the planners of and participants in the
&quot;ugly woman contest.&quot; He then held a meeting with members
of the student government and other student leaders. In this meeting,
it was agreed that Sigma Chi's behavior had created a hostile
learning environment for women and blacks, incompatible with the
University's mission.
<P>
The Dean met again with Fraternity representatives on April 18,
and the following day advised its officers of the sanctions imposed.
They included suspension from all activities for the rest of the
1991 spring semester and a two-year prohibition on all social
activities except pre-approved pledging events and pre-approved
philanthropic events with an educational purpose directly related
to gender discrimination and cultural diversity. The University's
sanctions also required Sigma Chi to plan and implement an educational
program addressing cultural differences, diversity, and the concerns
of women. A few weeks later, the University made minor modifications
to the sanctions, allowing Sigma Chi to engage in selected social
activities with the University's advance approval.
<P>
On June 5, 1991, Sigma Chi brought this action under 42 U.S.C.
Sec. 1983 (FN2) against the University and Dean Bumgarner. It
requested declaratory judgment and injunctive relief to nullify
the sanctions as violative of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
Sigma Chi moved for summary judgment on its First Amendment claims
on June 28, 1991, filing with its motions numerous affidavits
explaining the nature of the &quot;ugly woman contest.&quot; Also
submitted were large glossy photographs of the participants as
they appeared in the skits, including photographs of the Fraternity
member depicting the offensive caricature of the black woman.
<P>
In addition to the affidavit of Dean Bumgarner explaining his
meetings with student leaders, the University submitted the affidavits
of other officials, including that of University President George
W. Johnson and Vice-President Earl G. Ingram. President Johnson,
by his affidavit, presented the &quot;mission statement&quot;
of the University:
<P>
(3) George Mason University is committed to promoting a culturally
and racially diverse student body.... Education here is not limited
to the classroom.
<P>
(4) We are committed to teaching the values of equal opportunity
and equal treatment, respect for diversity, and individual dignity.
<P>
(5) Our mission also includes achieving the goals set forth in
our affirmative action *389 plan, a plan incorporating affirmative
steps designed to attract and retain minorities to this campus.
<P>
....
<P>
(7) George Mason University is a state institution of higher education
and a recipient of federal funds.
<P>
Vice President Earl G. Ingram's affidavit represented:
<P>
(6) The University's affirmative action plan is a part of an overall
state plan designed, in part, to desegregate the predominately
&quot;white&quot; and &quot;black&quot; public institutions of
higher education in Virginia.... The behavior of the members of
Sigma Chi that led to this lawsuit was completely antithetical
to the University's mission, as expressed through its affirmative
action statement and other pertinent University policies, to create
a non-threatening, culturally diverse learning environment for
students of all races and backgrounds, and of both sexes.
<P>
(7) While the University has progressed in attracting and retaining
minority students, it cannot expect to maintain the position it
has achieved, and make further progress on affirmative action
and minority issues that it wishes to make, if behavior like that
of Sigma Chi is perpetuated on this campus.
<P>
The district court granted summary judgment to Sigma Chi on its
First
<P>
Amendment claim, 773 F.Supp. 792 (E.D.Va.1991).
<P>
II
<P>
The University urges that the district court's grant of summary
judgment was premature. It stresses that there remain factual
issues which the district court should have weighed in its conclusion.
According to the University, the Fraternity's intent in staging
the contest is crucial to the issue of whether its conduct was
expressive. The University also stresses that if given time it
could demonstrate more completely the harm the contest caused
to its educational mission. It is, of course, beyond cavil that
summary judgment should not be granted while a viable issue of
material fact remains. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317,
322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). Summary judgment
principles require the court to find that the evidence is such
that a jury could not reasonably find for the party opposing summary
judgment. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252,
106 S.Ct. 2505, 2512, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). Only disputes over
facts that might affect the outcome of a suit under the applicable
law preclude entry of summary judgment.
<P>
In our view, for the reasons that follow, the district court was
correct in concluding that there was no outstanding issue of material
fact.
<P>
III
<P>
We initially face the task of deciding whether Sigma Chi's &quot;ugly
woman contest&quot; is sufficiently expressive to entitle it to
First Amendment protection. From the mature advantage of looking
back, it is obvious that the performance, apart from its charitable
fund-raising features, was an exercise of teenage campus excess.
With a longer and sobering perspective brought on by both peer
and official disapproval, even the governing members of the Fraternity
recognized as much. The answer to the question of whether the
First Amendment protects the Fraternity's crude attempt at entertainment,
however, is all the more difficult because of its obvious sophomoric
nature.
<P>
A
<P>
First Amendment principles governing live entertainment are relatively
clear: short of obscenity, it is generally protected. See, e.g.,
Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., --- U.S. ----, ----, 111 S.Ct. 2456,
2460, 115 L.Ed.2d 504 (1991) (nude dancing); Southeastern Promotions,
Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U.S. 546, 557-58, 95 S.Ct. 1239, 1245-47,
43 L.Ed.2d 448 (1975) (musical &quot;Hair&quot;); Berger v. Battaglia,
779 F.2d 992, 999 (4th Cir.1985) (blackface performance), cert.
denied, 476 U.S. 1159, 106 S.Ct. 2278, 90 L.Ed.2d 720 (1986).
As the Supreme Court announced in Schad v. Borough of Mount Ephraim,
452 U.S. 61, 101 S.Ct. 2176, 68 L.Ed.2d 671 (1981), &quot;[e]ntertainment,
as well as political and ideological speech, is protected; motion
pictures, programs broadcast by radio and television, and live
entertainment ... fall *390 within the First Amendment guarantee.&quot;
Id. at 65, 101 S.Ct. at 2180. Expression devoid of &quot;ideas&quot;
but with entertainment value may also be protected because &quot;[t]he
line between the informing and the entertaining is too elusive.&quot;
<P>
Winters v. New York, 333 U.S. 507, 510, 68 S.Ct. 665, 667, 92
L.Ed. 840 (1948).
<P>
Thus, we must determine if the skit performed by Sigma Chi comes
within the constitutionally protected rubric of entertainment.
Unquestionably, some forms of entertainment are so inherently
expressive as to fall within the First Amendment's ambit regardless
of their quality. For example, in Ward v. Rock Against Racism,
491 U.S. 781, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 105 L.Ed.2d 661 (1989), the Supreme
Court flatly ruled that &quot;[m]usic, as a form of expression
and communication, is protected under the First Amendment.&quot;
Id. at 790, 109 S.Ct. at 2753. Justice Kennedy explained: Music
is one of the oldest forms of human expression. From Plato's discourse
in the Republic to the totalitarian state in our own times, rulers
have known its capacity to appeal to the intellect and to the
emotions, and have censored musical compositions to serve the
needs of the state. The Constitution prohibits any like attempts
in our own legal order.
<P>
Id. (citations omitted).
<P>
Motion pictures, too, are included within the free speech guarantee
of the First Amendment. The Court emphasized in Joseph Burstyn,
Inc. v. Wilson, 343 U.S. 495, 72 S.Ct. 777, 96 L.Ed. 1098 (1952),
that &quot;[t]he importance of motion pictures as an organ of
public opinion is not lessened by the fact that they are designed
to entertain as well as to inform.&quot; Id. at 501, 72 S.Ct.
at 780; see also Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U.S.
50, 62, 96 S.Ct. 2440, 2448, 49 L.Ed.2d 310 (1976) (motion picture
theaters involve communication protected by the First Amendment,
but the state can regulate their secondary effects).
<P>
Even crude street skits come within the First Amendment's reach.
In overturning the conviction of an amateur actor for wearing
a military uniform in violation of a federal statute, the Supreme
Court discussed the statute's &quot;theatrical production&quot;
exception. (FN3) Schacht v. United States, 398 U.S. 58, 61-62,
90 S.Ct. 1555, 1558-59, 26 L.Ed.2d 44 (1970). Responding to the
Government's argument that the amateur skit was not a &quot;theatrical
production,&quot; Justice Black, writing for the majority, stated:
<P>
It may be that the performances were crude and amateurish and
perhaps unappealing, but the same thing can be said about many
theatrical performances. We cannot believe that when Congress
wrote out a special exception for theatrical productions it intended
to protect only a narrow and limited category of professionally
produced plays.
<P>
Id. Although this part of the opinion related to interpretation
of the involved statute, Justice Black proceeded to declare that
an actor participating in even a crude performance enjoys the
constitutional right to freedom of speech. Id. at 63, 90 S.Ct.
at 1559.
<P>
Bearing on this dichotomy between low and high-grade entertainment
are the Supreme Court's holdings relating to nude dancing. See
Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., --- U.S. at ----, ----, 111 S.Ct.
2456, 2460, 115 L.Ed.2d 504 (1991); Schad v. Borough of Mount
Ephraim, 452 U.S. 61, 65-66, 101 S.Ct. 2176, 2180-81, 68 L.Ed.2d
671 (1981); Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., 422 U.S. 922, 932-33, 95
S.Ct. 2561, 2568-69, 45 L.Ed.2d 648 (1975); California v. LaRue,
409 U.S. 109, 116-18, 93 S.Ct. 390, 395-97, 34 L.Ed.2d 342 (1972).
Most recently, in Barnes, the Supreme Court conceded that nude
dancing is expressive conduct entitled to First Amendment protection.
(FN4) Barnes, --- U.S. at *391 111 S.Ct. at 2460. In Barnes, the
Court reviewed a Seventh Circuit opinion authored by Judge Flaum,
Miller v. Civil City of South Bend, 904 F.2d 1081 (7th Cir.1990)
(en banc), rev'd sub nom. Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., --- U.S.
----, 111 S.Ct. 2456, 115 L.Ed.2d 504 (1991), which thoroughly
analyzed the questions of whether and how nude dancing is expression
entitled to First Amendment protection. The Miller opinion noted
that dance is inherently expressive entertainment, as it conveys
emotions and ideas. Judge Flaum refused to distinguish &quot;high&quot;
art from &quot;low&quot; entertainment on the asserted basis that
low entertainment &quot;fail[s] to communicate a defined intellectual
thought.&quot; Id. at 1086. Applying the test enunciated in Texas
v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 404, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 2539, 105 L.Ed.2d
342 (1989), (FN5) he concluded that nude dancing communicated
a message of eroticism and sensuality, understood by its viewers
as such. Miller, 904 F.2d at 1087. Thus, notwithstanding its artistic
quality, nude dancing was sufficiently expressive to entitle it
to First Amendment protection. Justice White's dissent in Barnes
echoed Judge Flaum's opinion:
<P>
&quot;[W]hile the entertainment afforded by a nude ballet at Lincoln
Center to those who can pay the price may differ vastly in content
(as viewed by judges) or in quality (as viewed by critics), it
may not differ in substance from the dance viewed by the person
who ... wants some 'entertainment' with his beer or shot of rye.&quot;
<P>
Barnes, --- U.S. at ----, 111 S.Ct. at 2475, 115 L.Ed.2d at 529
(White, J., dissenting) (quoting Salem Inn, Inc. v. Frank, 501
F.2d 18, 21 n. 3 (2d Cir.1974), modified sub nom. Doran v. Salem
Inn, Inc., 422 U.S. 922, 95 S.Ct. 2561, 45 L.Ed.2d 648 (1975)).
<P>
In sum, although the Barnes plurality did not explore these views,
it appears that the low quality of entertainment does not necessarily
weigh in the First Amendment inquiry. It would seem, therefore,
that the Fraternity's skit, even as low-grade entertainment, was
inherently expressive and thus entitled to First Amendment protection.
See Barnes, --- U.S. at ----, 111 S.Ct. at 2460;
<P>
Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 790, 109 S.Ct. 2746,
2753, 105 L.Ed.2d 661 (1989); Schad v. Borough of Mount Ephraim,
452 U.S. 61, 65-66, 101 S.Ct. 2176, 2180-81, 68 L.Ed.2d 671 (1981);
Schacht v. United States, 398 U.S. 58, 61-62, 90 S.Ct. 1555, 1558,
26 L.Ed.2d 44 (1970).
<P>
B
<P>
The University nevertheless contends that discovery will demonstrate
that the contest does not merit characterization as a skit but
only as mindless fraternity fun, devoid of any artistic expression.
It argues further that entitlement to First Amendment protection
exists only if the production was intended to convey a message
likely to be understood by a particular audience. See Texas v.
Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 404, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 2539, 105 L.Ed.2d
342 (1989). From the summary judgment record, the University insists,
it is impossible to discern the communicative intent necessary
to imbue the Fraternity's *392 conduct with a free speech component.
<P>
As indicated, we feel that the First Amendment protects the Fraternity's
skit because it is inherently expressive entertainment. Even if
this were not true, however, the skit, in our view, qualifies
as expressive conduct under the test articulated in Texas v. Johnson.
It is true that the Johnson test for determining the expressiveness
of conduct requires &quot; '[a]n intent to convey a particularized
message' &quot; and a great likelihood &quot; 'that the message
would be understood by those who viewed it.' &quot; Id. (quoting
Spence v. Washington, 418 U.S. 405, 410-11, 94 S.Ct. 2727, 2730,
41 L.Ed.2d 842 (1974)). As Johnson and Spence point out, however,
the intent to convey a message can be inferred from the conduct
and the circumstances surrounding it. Thus viewed, the University's
argument is self-defeating. The affidavit from the University's
Vice-President, Earl Ingram, stated that the message conveyed
by the Fraternity's conduct--that racial and sexual themes should
be treated lightly--was completely antithetical to the University's
mission of promoting diversity and providing an educational environment
free from racism and sexism.
<P>
Dean Bumgarner, in his affidavit, stated that the University does
not and cannot condone this type of on-campus behavior which perpetuated
derogatory racial and sexual stereotypes, tends to isolate minority
students, and creates a hostile and distracting learning environment.
Such behavior is incompatible with, and destructive to, the University's
mission of promoting diversity within its student body [and] sends
a message to the student body and the community that we ... are
not serious about hurtful and offensive behavior on campus.
<P>
Importantly, the affidavits establish that the punishment was
meted out to the Fraternity because its boorish message had interfered
with the described University mission. It is manifest from these
circumstances that the University officials thought the Fraternity
intended to convey a message. The Fraternity members' apology
and post-conduct contriteness suggest that they held the same
view. To be sure, no evidence suggests that the Fraternity advocated
segregation or inferior social status for women. What is evident
is that the Fraternity's purposefully nonsensical treatment of
sexual and racial themes was intended to impart a message that
the University's concerns, in the Fraternity's view, should be
treated humorously. From the Fraternity's conduct and the circumstances
surrounding it, we have no difficulty in concluding that it intended
to convey a message.
<P>
As to the second prong of the Johnson test, there was a great
likelihood that at least some of the audience viewing the skit
would understand the Fraternity's message of satire and humor.
Some students paid to attend the performance and were entertained.
What the Fraternity did not anticipate was the reaction to their
crude humor by other students on campus and University officials
who opposed the racist and sexist implications of the Fraternity's
skit.
<P>
Even considering, therefore, the sparsity of the evidentiary record,
we are persuaded that the Fraternity's &quot;ugly woman contest&quot;
satisfies the Johnson test for expressive conduct. (FN6)
<P>
IV
<P>
If this were not a sufficient response to the University's argument,
the principles relating to content and viewpoint discrimination
recently emphasized in R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, --- U.S. ----,
112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992), provide a definitive answer.
Although the Court in St. Paul reviewed the constitutional effect
of a city &quot;hate speech&quot; ordinance, and we review the
constitutionality of sanctions imposed for violating University
policy, St. Paul 's rationale applies here with equal force. Noting
that St. Paul's city ordinance prohibited displays *393 of symbols
that &quot;arouse[ ] anger, alarm or resentment in others on the
basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender,&quot; but did
not prohibit displays of symbols which would advance ideas of
racial or religious equality, Justice Scalia stated: &quot;The
First Amendment does not permit St. Paul to impose special prohibitions
on those speakers who express views on disfavored subjects.&quot;
Id. at ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2541, 2547.
<P>
As evidenced by their affidavits, University officials sanctioned
Sigma Chi for the message conveyed by the &quot;ugly woman contest&quot;
because it ran counter to the views the University sought to communicate
to its students and the community. (FN7) The mischief was the
University's punishment of those who scoffed at its goals of racial
integration and gender neutrality, while permitting, even encouraging,
conduct that would further the viewpoint expressed in the University's
goals and probably embraced by a majority of society as well.
&quot;The First Amendment generally prevents government from proscribing
... expressive conduct because of disapproval of the ideas expressed.&quot;
Id. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2542 (citing Johnson, 491 U.S. at 406,
109 S.Ct. at 2540).
<P>
The University, however, urges us to weigh Sigma Chi's conduct
against the substantial interests inherent in educational endeavors.
See Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Community Sch. Dist., 393 U.S.
503, 89 S.Ct. 733, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969). The University certainly
has a substantial interest in maintaining an educational environment
free of discrimination and racism, and in providing gender-neutral
education. Yet it seems equally apparent that it has available
numerous alternatives to imposing punishment on students based
on the viewpoints they express. (FN8) We agree wholeheartedly
that it is the University officials' responsibility, even their
obligation, to achieve the goals they have set. On the other hand,
a public university has many constitutionally permissible means
to protect female and minority students. We must emphasize, as
have other courts, that &quot;the manner of [its action] cannot
consist of selective limitations upon speech.&quot; St. Paul,
--- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2548; see also Carey v. Brown,
447 U.S. 455, 471, 100 S.Ct. 2286, 2295, 65 L.Ed.2d 263 (invalidating
a ban on residential picketing that exempted labor picketing);
Schacht v. United States, 398 U.S. 58, 62-63, 90 S.Ct. 1555, 1559,
26 L.Ed.2d 44 (1970) (invalidating a law that allowed wearing
military uniforms only in dramatic portrayals that did not &quot;tend
to discredit the military&quot;). The First Amendment forbids
the government from &quot;restrict[ing] expression because of
its message [or] its ideas.&quot; Police Dept. v. Mosley, 408
U.S. 92, 95, 92 S.Ct. 2286, 2289, 33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972). The University
should have accomplished its goals in some fashion other than
silencing speech on the basis of its viewpoint.
<P>
The decision of the district court is affirmed.
<P>
AFFIRMED.
<P>
MURNAGHAN, Circuit Judge, concurring in judgment:
<P>
While I agree with the majority's affirmance of the district court's
grant of summary judgment, I feel that its reasoning goes unnecessarily
too far. By holding that the First Amendment prohibits any action
by a public university to prevent or punish offensive conduct
like that at issue, the majority *394 goes much further than necessary,
going beyond the facts of the instant case in order to reach a
conclusion unsupported by First Amendment jurisprudence.
<P>
The present case can be decided easily within the contours of
First Amendment law simply by holding that George Mason University's
action violated the Fraternity members' rights by punishing them
post hoc and in conflict with its tacit approval of their performance.
Instead, the majority ranges far to discuss what it has concluded
the law would be absent such permission. The majority opinion
expounds upon the development of First Amendment doctrine and
concludes that George Mason was absolutely forbidden from regulating
speech based on its content. However, the Supreme Court has held
repeatedly that a content-based regulation of protected expression
survives judicial scrutiny if it &quot; 'is necessary to serve
a compelling state interest and is narrowly drawn to achieve that
end.' &quot; Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. v. New York Crime Victims
Board, 502 U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 501, 509, 116 L.Ed.2d 476
(1991) (quoting Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481
U.S. 221, 231, 107 S.Ct. 1722, 1728, 95 L.Ed.2d 209 (1987)). Accord
Perry Education Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U.S.
37, 45, 103 S.Ct. 948, 954, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983);
<P>
Carey v. Brown, 447 U.S. 455, 100 S.Ct. 2286, 65 L.Ed.2d 263 (1980).
Thus, the Supreme Court has recognized that regulation of speech
based on its content is not only permissible but, in limited circumstances,
justified.
<P>
In an attempt to reach a much broader conclusion, the majority
cites from Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 95,
92 S.Ct. 2286, 2289, 33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972). Yet, the quoted passage
from Mosley misrepresents its holding. The Mosley Court did not
rule that Chicago's selective proscription of nonlabor picketing
was per se unconstitutional, but rather indicated that the regulation
would be valid if Chicago demonstrated that nonlabor picketing
was &quot;clearly more disruptive than [labor] picketing.&quot;
408 U.S. at 100, 92 S.Ct. at 2292. A complete reading of First
Amendment jurisprudence reveals &quot;that content-based distinctions,
far from being presumptively invalid, are an inevitable and indispensable
aspect of a coherent understanding of the First Amendment.&quot;
R.A.V. v. St. Paul, --- U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 2563,
120 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992) (Stevens, J. concurring).
<P>
George Mason's treatment of the Fraternity is not itself constitutionally
flawed, because the University was concerned about the message
of the students' performance, but because of the permission to
give the performance which the University granted. The University,
following the Fraternity's performance of the skit, meted out
punishment to the Fraternity, without any prior indication that
such behavior was not allowed at school-sanctioned events, and
despite indicating that the Fraternity's skit had University approval.
<P>
Actually, forbidding the skit or requiring substantial amendment
was not beyond its power. The University does have greater authority
to regulate expressive conduct within its confines as a result
of the unique nature of the educational forum. Tinker v. Des Moines
School District, 393 U.S. 503, 513, 89 S.Ct. 733, 740, 21 L.Ed.2d
731 (1969) (holding that expressive activity in a school setting
can only be restricted if it &quot;materially disrupts classwork
or involves substantial disorder or invasion of the rights of
others&quot;); see also Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S.
104, 117-118, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 2304, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972) (stating
that the Court had never &quot;suggested that students, teachers,
or anyone else has an absolute right to use all parts of a school
building or its immediate environs for his [or her] unlimited
expressive purposes&quot;); cf. Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263,
276-277, 102 S.Ct. 269, 277-278, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981).
<P>
In Widmar, Justice Stevens, concurring in judgment, has provided
an insightful analysis of the special character of institutions
of higher education:
<P>
Today most major colleges and universities are operated by public
authority. Nevertheless, their facilities are not open to the
public in the same way that streets and parks are. University
facilities--private or public--are maintained primarily for the
benefit of the student body and the  faculty. In performing their
learning and *395. teaching missions, the managers of a university
routinely make countless decisions based on the content of communicative
materials. They select books for inclusion in the library, they
hire professors on the basis of their academic philosophies, they
select courses for inclusion in the curriculum, and they reward
scholars for what they have written. In addition, encouraging
students to participate in extracurricular activities, they necessarily
make decisions concerning the content of those activities.
<P>
454 U.S. at 278, 102 S.Ct. at 278 (Stevens, J., concurring in
judgment). In the present case, the University, by officially
recognizing Greek-letter social organizations and participating
in the planning of their events, inevitably has participated in
the activities of those groups. Therefore, it must retain the
ability to refuse to sanction certain behavior which infringes
on the rights of other students. The University need not allow
activity distinctly injurious to its objectives.
<P>
Certainly, the most fundamental concern of a university is to
provide the optimum conditions for learning. The majority concedes
that &quot;the University certainly has a substantial interest
in maintaining an educational environment free of discrimination
and racism, and in providing gender-neutral education.&quot; Therefore,
the University must have some leeway to regulate conduct which
counters that interest, and thereby infringes upon the right of
other students to learn. See Tinker, 393 U.S. at 513, 89 S.Ct.
at 740; cf. R.A.V., --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2565 (Stevens,
J. concurring) (&quot;A selective proscription of unprotected
expression designed to protect 'certain persons or groups' would
be constitutional if it were based on a legitimate determination
that the harm created by the regulated expression differs from
that created by the unregulated expression.&quot;).
<P>
By concluding that a university must be allowed to regulate expressive
conduct which runs directly counter to its mission, I do not mean
to imply that a university has the unrestricted power to silence
entirely certain perspectives. I wholeheartedly believe that the
free exchange of ideas and debate are fundamental to a place of
learning. Yet, they comprise only part of a university's mission
and must be balanced against a university's other interests, especially
those interests which rise to the level of constitutional significance.
(FN*)
<P>
Moreover, if the University, in advance, had refused to allow
the Fraternity to perform its intended skit, the marketplace of
ideas would hardly have been endangered. The Fraternity, if it
wished, could have presented its ideas and perspectives on the
value of women and Blacks in an open debate, allowing other students
to challenge its perspective.
<P>
All in all, my concurrence rests on the unrevoked permission to
give the skit. I find it unnecessary, and of doubtful validity,
to suggest that, regardless of such approval, there was any First
Amendment provision guaranteeing the right to give the skit, in
circumstances under which it was inextricably linked with George
Mason University.
<P>
FN1. Although Sigma Chi's national fraternity is not involved
in the litigation, the IOTA Chapter XI is hereafter referred to
as &quot;Sigma Chi&quot; or &quot;the Fraternity.&quot;
<P>
FN2. Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance,
regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the
District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any
citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction
thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities
secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party
injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding
for redress....
<P>
42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983.
<P>
FN3. 10 U.S.C. Sec. 772(f) provides:
<P>
While portraying a member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine
Corps, an actor in a theatrical or motion-picture production may
wear the uniform of that armed force if the portrayal does not
tend to discredit that armed force.
<P>
FN4. At least eight justices agreed that First Amendment protection
extends to nude dancing, but they differed in their approaches
to defining that protection. Justice Rehnquist, writing for a
plurality, relied on the four-part test announced in United States
v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968).
He concluded that the Indiana statute prohibiting public nudity
was constitutional because it was unrelated to the suppression
of speech, infringed only incidentally on protected expression,
and furthered the important government interest of prohibiting
public nudity. Justice Scalia concurred in the result, but wrote
separately because he believed the statute regulated conduct,
not expression. Justice Souter also wrote separately because he
believed that the state's interest was to combat secondary effects,
an interest unrelated to the suppression of expression.
<P>
Justice White, joined by Justices Marshall, Blackmun, and Stevens,
dissented, stating that the Indiana statute targeted the erotic
message communicated by nude dancing. He would have applied a
higher standard of scrutiny than the O'Brien test requires. *395_
<P>
Because the sanctions imposed in this case targeted the message
communicated by Sigma Chi's skit and are thus related to the suppression
of speech, we do not rely on the O'Brien balancing test as the
Barnes plurality did.
<P>
FN5. In Texas v. Johnson, discussed infra, the Supreme Court stated:
<P>
In deciding whether particular conduct possesses sufficient communicative
elements to bring the First Amendment into play, we have asked
whether &quot;[a]n intent to convey a particularized message was
present, and [whether] the likelihood was great that the message
would be understood by those who viewed it.&quot;
<P>
Johnson, 491 U.S. at 404, 109 S.Ct. at 2539 (quoting Spence v.
Washington, 418 U.S. 405, 410-11, 94 S.Ct. 2727, 2730, 41 L.Ed.2d
842 (1974)). FN6. We think this conclusion gains support from
City of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Publishing Co., 486 U.S. 750,
108 S.Ct. 2138, 100 L.Ed.2d 771 (1988), in which the Supreme Court
said that one factor weighing in the equation of whether conduct
is expressive is &quot;whether the activity in question is commonly
associated with expression.&quot; Id. at 769, 108 S.Ct. at 2150.
A live, albeit crude, skit performed for an audience is an activity
commonly associated with expression.
<P>
FN7. Nor can we accept the University's contention that the sanctions
were imposed as a result of the Fraternity's &quot;pure conduct,&quot;
unrelated to its communicative aspects or viewpoint. See Arcara
v. Cloud Books, Inc., 478 U.S. 697, 702-05, 106 S.Ct. 3172, 3175-77,
92 L.Ed.2d 568 (1986); Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence,
468 U.S. 288, 293 &amp; n. 5, 104 S.Ct. 3065, 3069 &amp; n. 5,
82 L.Ed.2d 221 (1984); United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367,
376, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 1678, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968); Kovacs v. Cooper,
336 U.S. 77, 89, 69 S.Ct. 448, 454, 93 L.Ed. 513 (1949). The University's
affidavits clearly point to the contrary conclusion.
<P>
FN8. In St. Paul, the Court rejected the Minnesota Supreme Court's
pronouncement that St. Paul's &quot;hate speech&quot; ordinance
was narrowly tailored to serve St. Paul's compelling interest
in &quot;ensur[ing] the basic human rights of members of groups
that ha[d] historically been subjected to discrimination.&quot;
St. Paul, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2549. Although the Court
acknowledged that this interest was compelling, it concluded that
the content discrimination contained in the ordinance was not
&quot;reasonably necessary to achieve St. Paul's compelling interests.&quot;
Id.
<P>
FN* In a case decided one month prior to R.A.V., the Supreme Court
noted that among the most difficult First Amendment cases were
those requiring a reconciliation of our commitment to free speech
with our commitment to other constitutional rights. Burson v.
Freeman, --- U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 1846, 1851, 119 L.Ed.2d
5 (1992). In Burson, the Court ultimately upheld the content-based
regulation, namely, a Tennessee law prohibiting election-day political
speeches within 100 feet of a polling place, holding that the
State's interest in protecting the right to vote was sufficiently
compelling.

v.
<P>

<P>

<P>
E.D. Virginia,
<P>
Alexandria Division.

MEMORANDUM OPINION
<P>
HILTON, District Judge.
<P>
This matter comes before the court on plaintiffs' motion for summary
judgment and defendants' motion to dismiss. In this action, the
plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief for George Mason
University's imposition of discipline on the plaintiff fraternity
which has allegedly abridged the plaintiffs' right of free speech.
Plaintiffs argue that the discipline imposed upon *793 them unconstitutionally
punishes expression protected by the First Amendment. Defendants
contend that the plaintiffs' conduct was not protected speech
and that if protected speech, George Mason University has compelling
educational interests at stake which justify the discipline imposed
on plaintiffs.
<P>
This action arises under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to
the United States Constitution and 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983. This court
has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Secs.
1331 and 1343 and may give declaratory relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
Sec. 2201. The plaintiffs in this action are the Iota Xi Chapter
of Sigma Chi Fraternity which is at George Mason University (GMU)
and two members of the fraternity, the president and the immediate
past president of the chapter. Defendant GMU is a public university
maintained and funded in significant part by the Commonwealth
of Virginia which was acting as an educational institution at
all relevant times. Defendant Dean Bumgarner is the associate
vice president and dean of student services at GMU who was acting
on behalf of GMU at all relevant times.
<P>
For the past two years, a week long event known as Derby Days
has been held at GMU by the Iota Xi chapter of Sigma Chi. Derby
Days is a major social event for the chapter and is held to raise
money for charity. One event during Derby Days has traditionally
been the &quot;Dress A Sig&quot; contest in which members of the
fraternity dress as caricatures of &quot;ugly women&quot;.
<P>
During the week of March 11, 1991, Dominic Lapus, an Iota Xi chapter
member acting as co-chair of the 1991 Derby Days program, submitted
the printed Derby Days program for approval to Kathryn Schilling,
GMU's assistant director of student organizations and programs.
The program listed the following as one event: &quot;Dress a SIG
contest (dress coaches like ugly women.)&quot;. As in former years,
university approval was sought. Ms. Schilling approved the Derby
Days program on behalf of the university, after requiring numerous
changes to be made in the proposed program. She required no changes
whatsoever to be made relative to the proposed &quot;ugly woman&quot;
contest.
<P>
The &quot;Dress A Sig&quot; event took place on April 4, 1991
in the cafeteria of the student union building on the campus of
GMU. In that event, one of the participants dressed in black face,
used pillows to represent breasts and buttocks and wore a black
wig with curlers. One week later, several GMU student leaders
signed a letter to Dean Bumgarner requesting the imposition of
sanctions on the Iota Xi chapter of Sigma Chi as the &quot;Dress
A Sig&quot; contest had offended them because it perpetuated racial
and sexual stereotypes. On April 19, 1991 Dean Bumgarner announced
the proposed discipline and clarified that discipline in a letter
on May 1, 1991. The discipline imposed by Dean Bumgarner and GMU
prevents the plaintiffs from holding social and sports activities
for a two year probationary period and, during that same period,
requires the chapter to submit other planned activities to the
university for advance approval.
<P>
Plaintiffs and defendants agree that the First Amendment claims
are ripe for summary judgment. As there are no material facts
in dispute on the First Amendment claims, it is proper to resolve
this issue on summary judgment.
<P>
One of the fundamental rights secured by the First Amendment is
that of free, uncensored expression, even on matters some may
think are trivial, vulgar or profane. Berger v. Battaglia, 779
F.2d 992, 1000 (4th Cir.1985), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1159, 106
S.Ct. 2278, 90 L.Ed.2d 720 (1986). Because that fundamental right
extends to students at a state university, a state university
may not hinder the exercise of First Amendment rights simply because
it feels that exposure to a given group's ideas may be somehow
harmful to certain students. Gay Alliance of Students v. Matthews,
544 F.2d 162, 166 (4th Cir.1976); Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169,
187-88, 92 S.Ct. 2338, 2349-50, 33 L.Ed.2d 266 (1972).
<P>
Plaintiffs assert that the discipline imposed by GMU unconstitutionally
punishes expression protected by the First *794 Amendment. Defendants,
however, argue that the behavior of the plaintiffs at the &quot;Dress
A Sig&quot; contest was not expressive and therefore, not protected
speech. Defendants contend that only political and social speech
are protected by the First Amendment and that this conduct is
neither. However, the Supreme Court has held that activity such
as nude dancing and performance in black face are protected expression
under the First Amendment. Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., --- U.S.
----, 111 S.Ct. 2456, 115 L.Ed.2d 504 (1991); Schad v. Borough
of Mt. Ephraim, 452 U.S. 61, 101 S.Ct. 2176, 68 L.Ed.2d 671 (1981);
Berger v. Battaglia, 779 F.2d 992 (4th Cir.1985), cert. denied,
476 U.S. 1159, 106 S.Ct. 2278, 90 L.Ed.2d 720 (1986).
<P>
In Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., --- U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 2456,
115 L.Ed.2d 504 (1991), Indiana enforced a public indecency law
which prevented the respondent establishments from providing totally
nude dancing as entertainment. Although nude dancing was protected
by the First Amendment, the Court held that the Indiana public
indecency law was permissible. The Court found that the Indiana
law sought to regulate conduct, specifically public nudity, and
not an expressive message. 111 S.Ct. at 2463. The Court noted
that &quot; 'It is possible to find some kernel of expression
in almost every activity a person undertakes ... but such a kernel
is not sufficient to bring the activity within the protection
of the First Amendment.' &quot; Id. at 2462 (quoting Dallas v.
Stanglin, 490 U.S. 19, 25, 109 S.Ct. 1591, 1595, 104 L.Ed.2d 18
(1989)).
<P>
In this case, however, GMU did not seek to regulate any conduct
whatsoever. It was not the conduct of renting the auditorium,
holding Derby Days, raising money for charity, providing entertainment,
or performing a skit which prompted GMU to discipline the members
of Sigma Chi. To the contrary, it was the expressive message conveyed
by the skit which was perceived as offensive by several student
groups which prompted GMU to discipline the fraternity. This skit
contained more than a kernel of expression; therefore, the activity
demands First Amendment protection.
<P>
Even if the activity is protected, the defendants contend that
any infringement on the First Amendment rights of the Sigma Chi
fraternity is permissible because compelling educational interests
are at stake. In particular, the defendants assert that Sigma
Chi's behavior undermines the education of minority and women
students, the university's mission to promote learning through
a culturally diverse student body, the university's mission to
eliminate racist and sexist behavior on campus and the university's
mission to accomplish maximal desegregation of its student body.
Although the university has these interests, there has been no
substantial or material disruption of GMU's educational mission.
See Bethel School District No. 403 v. Fraser, 478 U.S. 675, 106
S.Ct. 3159, 92 L.Ed.2d 549 (1986); Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169,
92 S.Ct. 2338, 33 L.Ed.2d 266 (1972); Crosby v. Holsinger, 852
F.2d 801 (4th Cir.1988). The student activity at issue in this
action is consistent with GMU's educational mission in conveying
ideas and promoting the free flow and expression of those ideas.
<P>
Furthermore, defendants have only alleged general, unspecified
claims of harm to the students who were exposed to the &quot;Dress
A Sig&quot; contest. &quot;The First Amendment does not guarantee
that other concepts virtually sacred to our Nation as a whole--such
as the principle that discrimination based on race is odious and
destructive--will go unquestioned in the marketplace of ideas.&quot;
Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 2546, 105 L.Ed.2d
342 (1989). As noted by the Fourth Circuit in Berger v. Battaglia
a more appropriate response to the activities of the fraternity,
and one consistent with the First Amendment &quot;would have been
instead to say to those offended by ... [the] speech that their
right to protest that speech by all peaceable means would be as
stringently safeguarded ... as would ... [the] right to engage
in it.&quot; Berger, 779 F.2d at 1001.
<P>
Defendants also raise the issue of whether or not the cafeteria
auditorium used by the plaintiffs is a public forum. However,
that is not a compelling issue since GMU *795. permits the cafeteria
auditorium to be used upon written application by student groups
to hold charity events and to perform skits. In fact, GMU approved
the plaintiffs' application to use the cafeteria auditorium on
April 4, 1991.
<P>
Although appropriate time, place and manner restrictions on free
expression are permissible, a state university may not suppress
expression because it finds that expression offensive. See Piarowski
v. Illinois Community College, 759 F.2d 625, 630 (7th Cir.) (racially
and sexually offensive art work not subject to outright suppression
by state school), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1007, 106 S.Ct. 528,
88 L.Ed.2d 460 (1985). In this instance GMU has disciplined the
members of Sigma Chi because the activity was deemed offensive
by them and not because the members violated any time, place or
manner regulations imposed by the university on the &quot;Dress
A Sig&quot; contest. In fact, Sigma Chi submitted a copy of a
schedule of proposed events for Derby Days, including the &quot;Dress
A Sig&quot; event, to the assistant director of student organizations
and programs at GMU. At that time no objections to the event were
made by GMU. &quot;If there is a bedrock principle underlying
the First Amendment, it is that the Government may not prohibit
the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea
itself offensive or disagreeable.&quot; Texas v. Johnson, 109
S.Ct. at 2544. The First Amendment does not recognize exceptions
for bigotry, racism, and religious intolerance or ideas or matters
some may deem trivial, vulgar or profane.
<P>
Plaintiffs' expression occurred at a charity social event in the
cafeteria of the student union before an audience composed of
students and non-students who paid money to witness a performance.
Although the university disagreed with the message propounded
by the fraternity's activity, GMU may not discipline the students
by infringing on their First Amendment rights based on the perceived
offensive content of the activity. &quot;[O]ne of the most persistent
and insidious threats to first amendment rights has been that
posed by the 'heckler's veto,' imposed by the successful importuning
of government to curtail 'offensive' speech at peril of suffering
disruptions of public order.&quot; Berger, 779 F.2d at 1001 (citations
omitted). In this instance, GMU sought to discipline the students
based precisely on the &quot;heckler's veto&quot;. That is not
permissible.
<P>
The court need not reach the defendants' motion to dismiss as
this summary judgment motion is dispositive. Summary judgment
is granted in favor of the plaintiffs and the defendants are enjoined
from imposing any discipline on the plaintiffs as a result of
the activity of April 4, 1991.

<h2>Renewing the war on drugs</h2>
<h3>By William J. Bennett<br>
and John P. Walters</h3>
</center>
<blockquote>
<p>
Through its indifference to rising drug use and its erosion of the moral and governmental foundations of the successful anti-drug efforts of the past two administrations, the Clinton Administration has put the nation on a dangerous path. The President bears the principal political responsibility for this record. And only he can use his office to begin to correct it. Congressional leaders in both parties should give him every possible to that.  If the Clinton Administration does not see the light, it should feel the political heat.<p>

As the past two years demonstrate, the nation cannot sustain an effective anti-drug effort without leadership. Congress, governors, mayors, and community leaders, need to meet this challenge.  There are specific roles to fill for federal, state, and local governments, as well as the private institutions that support our families and communities.<p>

<I>Restoring effective federal action</I><br>
The cornerstone of national anti-drug efforts is to give force to the principle that drug use is wrong, harmful and will not be tolerated. This principle should be embodied in the institutions of society, which, in turn, should be organized to give force to that principle.  Without the federal government doing its part, this endeavor will be much more difficult<p>

1. While efforts by the federal government are not sufficient, they are a necessary element of an effective national anti-drug effort.  Executive leadership begins with the president and his appointees in relevant executive agencies. The White House drug policy office was created - at the insistence of a Democratic Congress - to organize and lead the war on drugs. Right now that office is not doing its job, and the Clinton Administration made it largely irrelevant. The President should give someone the responsibility and the authority to get the executive branch, and the federal government, back in the fight.<p>

2. The world headquarters for the cocaine industry is Colombia. The era of meaningful partnership with that government has ended. And there are reliable press reports that the current president of Columbia received campaign money from the cartels. But the heart of the matter today is that U.S. and Colombian enforcement agencies know who the leaders of the cartels are and where they are. The Colombians could arrest or force into hiding the management of the cocaine industry, and disrupt the cocaine trade as they have done in the past. But there is no evidence the Colombian government has any intention of doing so. Occasional showy enforcement operations continue, but no real efforts are mounted and therefore no real progress is made. The US. government has done virtually nothing to give the legitimate interests in Colombian society reason to undertake the risk and effort of making their government put the cocaine trade out of business. It is time to give them such a reason. During the recent embargoes on Iraq and Haiti, experts warned that these measures are most effective when applied rapidly and totally against a trading ally. The US. accounts for more than 35percent of Colombia's licit foreign exports. Such action against Colombia would change the priority of anti-drug efforts throughout the international community.<p>

3. Put the US. military in charge of stopping the flow of illegal drugs from abroad. Require federal law enforcement agencies responsible for drug interdiction to operate under the overall command and control of the military. This mission will require continuous adaptation because traffickers will inevitably try new avenues as the old ones become too costly. Some in the military will object to this non-traditional mission and its cost. But no law enforcement organization will ever have the intelligence and operational capabilities for the interdiction task that the military already possesses. Over the last few years the US. has used its military resources to protect poor and endangered citizens of other countries.  It is time-it is past time- to stop overlooking the poor and endangered in our cities.<p>

4.  The drug trade inside the US. relies on sophisticated senior management.  Despite periodic law enforcement successes, federal domestic enforcement agencies have produced no serious disruption of major trafficking operations.  And for the last two years the Clinton Administration has allowed the DEA, FBI, and other drug enforcement agencies to curry political favor with local authorities by assigning federal personnel to augment manpower for cases with no federal significance.  This might be acceptable if important federal responsibilities were being met.  But they are not.  We therefore need to establish clear federal drug enforcement priorities and hold enforcement authorities accountable for meeting them.  For example, the Attorney General should be required to prepare a report every six months identifying all major drug trafficking organization know to be operation in the US and  a plan to deploy federal enforcement personnel to dismantle them.  Congress should also make the funding for federal enforcement personnel to dismantle them.  Congress should also make the funding for federal drug enforcement agencies contingent on effectively implementing this policy.<p>

5.  The Congress should combine existing federal aid to the states and localities for drug enforcement, prevention, and treatment (now, roughly $3.5 billion per year) into a single block grant distributed on the basis of population.  Individual program mandates should be abolished so states and localities can establish and pursue their own priorities for fighting drug use and drug crime.  Law enforcement, drug treatment, and prevention education are local responsibilities.  Washington's bureaucratic regulation has utterly failed to engender programs that foster local accountability.  Therefor, the new block grand should be designed to restore local responsibility by phasing them out after three years.  In this way, communities will have an incentive to use these funds for those activities that demonstrate sufficient merit to deserve long term support entirely from local sources.<p>

<I>Creating effective local action</I> <br>
6.  Drug prevention is central to all effective anti-drug efforts.  Young people who do not use drugs in their teens are unlikely to ever become involved with illegal drugs.  But each generation bust be taught that illegal drug use is wrong and harmful.  This lesson must be taught by the community as a whole; indeed, by our culture.  Children learn about drugs by what the adults around them as a whole say and do.  Parents teach by precept and example.  The same is true of schools and the communities.  If drug use and sale is not aggressively opposed and prevented, children learn it is acceptable despite what some adults may occasionally tell them.  Teaching drug prevention must be apart of teaching children right from wrong.  It will always fall to parents to provide that education in home and act to ensure that schools and their communities are teaching this lesson effectively.  This task is easier if national leaders set the right example and speak in support of parents.  But since that national support has seriously eroded, parents, churches, schools, youth organization, and communities are more important than ever.  They have always been, and will always remain, the first line of defense for children.<p>

7.  Open-air drug markets feed addiction and are a visible sign of the toleration of the drug trade in our nation.  It is a national disgrace that such markets are tolerated in virtually every major American city. Drug pushers cannot operate effectively when law enforcement personnel are present.  Forcing drug deals from open spaced makes their lives more difficult and dangerous and hence their activities less frequent.  Many communities have demonstrated that creating a law enforcement presence and maintaining it in response to relocation efforts by drug dealers is doable - but only if closing drug markets is made a priority.  In the next year, mayors, city councils, and police chiefs should pledge and make clear that they will insist that these officials keep it.  We need to stop claiming that the crime and drug problem in our communities is someone else's responsibility.  Decisive action can be taken by local officials and community members now.<p>

8.  Drug testing is a proven tool to discourage drug use by individuals in treatment and those in the criminal justice system.  Good treatment programs require regular testing and apply sanctions against individuals who relapse.  Drug testing arrestees provides a basis for using bail, sentencing, release conditions and other aspects of the criminal justice system to compel individuals to stop using drugs.  Including an extended period of regular testing after offenders complete their sentences, discourages a return to drug use and crime.  Positive drug tests must involve steadily escalating penalties (starting with a one or tow-day return to jail or a half-way house and moving to reincarceration for an extended period).  Most heavy drug users pass through the criminal justice system and any short-term of a drug testing program will save larger costs to the community in repeated criminal justice expenditures on the same individual land the damage their crimes do to the innocents.<p>

These eight steps - involving federal, state, local, and individual action - will reverse the dangerous resurgence of drugs that has occurred during President Clinton's watch.  These actions will help turn the country away from its present course and go a long way toward making progress in the war on drugs.  And that, in turn, will help America to become a safer, more decent and more civilized society.<p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>C. S. Lewis is perhaps the most widely known and read Christian
intellectual of the 20th century. His various works continue to sell more
than a millioin copies each year. He is best known for his theological and
fictional writings, but Lewis also was an articulate defender of representative
democracy, limited government, property rights, and the moral principles
upon which free societies are based. As Americans today seek to apply their
religion beliefs in the public arena in a constructive manner, there is
much they might be able to learn from Lewis.<BR>
<BR>
Accordingly, the purpose of Discovery Institute's project about Lewis and
politics is to use Lewis's writings to help American's better understand
the connections between faith and public life. The project includes public
conferences, books, scholarly colloquium, and published writings by Discovery
Fellows.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<b>For Immediate Release     
</b>
<P>
September 17, 1996<BR>
<P>
 Small Business Advocate Applauds Senate Labor &amp; Human Resource
Committee<BR>
<P>
Washington, D.C. -- Today, the Senate Labor and Human Resource
Committee is holding an oversight hearing of the National Labor
Relations Board.  In response to the hearing, Small Business Survival
Committee president, Karen Kerrigan, made the following statement:
<BR>
<P>
&quot;The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC) calls on the
National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to cease its open agenda
of union activism, and to work toward balanced enforcement of
the labor laws.  Rather than acting as an objective and independent
agency, the NLRB has assumed the appearance of a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the AFL-CIO.<BR>
<P>
Since 1994, Clinton appointees to the National Labor Relations
Board have waged an unprecedented assault on small businesses.
 Most notoriously, the Board's proposed &quot;single location
bargaining unit rule&quot; would limit the rights of employers
while promoting unionization of small businesses.<BR>
<P>
Less well known but equally hostile to small business owners,
is the enforcement policy of the General Counsel.  The illicit
union tactics known as salting and corporate campaigns have been
tolerated and tacitly promoted by this Board.  Unions have been
able to wear down small businesses through the filing of frivolous
charges with the NLRB.  The agency has been quick to adopt novel
union theories of labor law violations, yet slow to dismiss even
the most baseless of charges against employers.  The result has
been exorbitant legal expenses, increased labor-management hostility,
and declining respect for this independent agency.<BR>
<P>
The public recognizes the importance of small business to the
economy, and to the lives of millions of working Americans.  The
public has the right to know of this government-endorsed program
of labor union promotion.  SBSC hails today's hearing of the Senate
Labor &amp; Human Resources Committee as the first step toward
ending the NLRB's assault on small business and its workers.&quot;

<center><h2>MRC's Tim Graham Authors Explosive New Book</h2></center>
<dd><big>F</big>rom the Media Research Center's MediaWatch Associate Editor Tim Graham comes a new book entitled <b><i>Pattern of Deception: The Media's Role in the Clinton Presidency.</i></b>
The result of four years of exhaustive research, the book proves beyond a shadow of a doubt how the press has misled the American people by massaging Clinton's image, masking his faults, attacking his opponents and distorting the truth. 
<dd>Using reporters' own words, supplemented by data from the Media Research Center's studies and analyses, <b><i>Pattern of Deception</i></b> not only indicts the media, it <b>convicts</b> them. Starting with the primary campaign in early 1992 and going through to the present, <b><i>Pattern of Deception</i></b> lays bare the undeniable, irrefutable, unmistakable pro-Clinton bias in the national media. 
<dd>The release of <b><i>Pattern of Deception</i></b> officially kicks off the MRC's "Tell the Truth!" campaign to stop the liberal media's shameless promotion of Bill Clinton. We have already distributed over 1,000 books to reporters, columnists, television and radio talk show hosts and producers, as well as to every conservative Member of Congress. We are arming conservatives in the media and public policy with the definitive evidence of how the national press is doing everything in its power to promote Bill Clinton and his left-wing agenda. And we're letting liberals know we conservatives are fighting back.
<dd>Tim Graham is heading up a major television and radio blitz. Within days of the official release, he participated in an interview on the 700 <i>Club</i> with Pat Robertson; a panel discussion on PBS's <i>McCuistion</i>; and interviews on radio stations WSPD in Ohio, KSL in Utah, WTIC in Connecticut, WBSN in Massachusetts, KLIF and WOAI in Texas, WJR in Michigan, WAIM in South Carolina, WTAL in Florida, KSN in South Dakota, WROK in Illinois, WWDB in Pennsylvania, as well as the G. <i>Gordon Liddy Show</i>, which airs across the country. Many, many more shows are lining up to get the message out.
<dd>Get the book that Arianna Huffington, Chair for the Center for Effective Compassion, calls "must reading for the GOP." R. Emmett Tyrrell, Editor in Chief of the <i>American Spectator</i> says <i><b>Pattern of Deception</b></i>, "shows that the press has been easier on Boy Clinton than Gennifer Flowers was." And nationally syndicated columnist and CNBC talk show host Cal Thomas exclaims, "No one is doing a better job of holding the press accountable for failing to live up to its high calling than the Media Research Center. In <b><i>Pattern of Deception</i></b> you'll read how the press have given the Clinton administration a free ride on policy issues which are far more important to the future of lib-eralism than personal peccadilloes." 
<dd>We're offering <b><i>Pattern of Deception</i></b> at a phenomenally low price for Members only. Please see ordering information <a href="#order">here</a>.

<center><h3>A New Poll Rocks the world of Journalism</h3></center>
Dear MRC Member,
<p>
<dd><big>A</big> new poll from the Roper Center and the Freedom Forum has rocked the world of journalism. It proves that Washington-based reporters and editors are even more liberal than we thought. Just look at the numbers: 89 percent voted for Clinton in 1992 (as opposed to 43 percent of the public); only 7 percent voted for Bush; only 4 percent are registered Republicans, while 50 percent are Democrats; only 3 percent think the Contract With America was a serious proposal. And get this: only 2 percent call themselves conservative.
<dd>Remarkably, <b>still</b> reporters are denying a bias when given these numbers! I was asked to debate <i>Newsweek</i>'s Eleanor Clift on CNN's <i>Crossfire</i> recently; both Robert Novak and I listened incredulously as she absolutely denied these numbers were evidence of bias. Rather, she said, it proved how good a job the media are doing, since they are being so tough on Bill Clinton.
<dd>It defies belief. It also explains why our work is so critical to the conservative movement. In the past month we've had a host of new programs:
<ol>
<li>After four years of research, Tim Graham's new book, <b><i>Pattern of Deception: The Media's Role in the Clinton Presidency</b></i>, is now published. It proves how the liberal press worked to elect  Bill Clinton for President in '92, how they've championed his agenda since then, and how they're doing it again in '96.
<li>During Holy Week we released our third annual <b><i>Faith in a Box: Television and Religion 1995</i></b>. By studying over 41,000 network news stories and 1,800 hours of prime time entertainment programs in 1995 we have documented the media's  antagonism toward religious institutions, leaders, and doctrines. It's gratifying to know that some in the press are finally admitting it. "I think there is...a problem with what I call cultural bias on these subjects...religion, abortion, and homosexuality," said <i>Washington Post</i> reporter Howard Kurtz. "I think a lot of it is unconscious, but I think those kinds of subjects, most reporters are probably to the left of the American public and probably don't realize that they're not always giving a full weights of views of people who have a very different take on these matters."
</ol>And then there is the MRC's campaign to bring the "family hour" back to prime time television. (The campaign began with the release of our study, <i><b>A Vanishing Haven: The Decline of the Family Hour</b></i>.) The momentum is growing: over 70 Members of Congress have publicly joined our efforts and signed their names to a full page advertisement that ran in Daily Variety, one of the entertainment industry's leading trade publications.
<dd>All three ventures have something in common: none of these efforts has ever been done before simply because conservatives didn't have the organization or resources to undertake these huge projects. In one month we launched all three of them, and liberals' heads are spinning. They've never been hit like this before, and it explains Bob Novak's statement to me at a reception last week. "They hate you, Brent," he laughed. "They hate you more than any conservative in America!"  Given the company that puts me in, I'm honored.
<dd>Thanks for making all of this possible.
Sincerely,
<p>

<b><font size=+1>-"They hate you, Brent. They hate you more than any conservative in America!"</font></b>

<center><h2>Tell the Truth! Update</center></h2>
<dd><big>T</big>he biggest obstacle for conservatives in every presidential election for the past 30 years is the media's unfair, slanted coverage. This year the MRC has announced we've had enough -- and we aren't going to take anymore. And we're putting our money where our mouth is -- a $2 million Tell the Truth! Campaign to expose the leftist agenda of the media.
<dd>The national campaign is in full gear; the MRC is everywhere in the press right now. 
<dd>Our "Blast Fax" press release campaign is providing conservative radio talk show hosts and columnists with daily ammunition exposing media distortions. Rush Limbaugh, Ollie North, Paul Harvey and a host of others are passing this information on to <b>millions</b> on a daily basis. 
<dd>MRC spokesmen are appearing on numerous television and radio shows every single day. They've appeared on CNN's Crossfire, CBN's the 700 Club, National Public Radio, the Oliver North Show, and literally dozens and dozens of others in just the past few weeks alone.
<dd>We have begun distributing Tim Graham's blockbuster new book Pattern of Deception: The Media's Role in the Clinton Presidency to hundreds of conservatives in the media and public policy. 
<p><font size=+1><blockquote>From now until the election you will find these regular updates in <i>FLASH</i> on what the MRC is doing to expose the media's biased election coverage.</blockquote></font>
<p>
<dd>Since Tim Graham began his media blitz for the book, orders have been flooding our office. We are confident from these early responses to the book that <i>Pattern of Deception</i> will be hugely successful in exposing how the leftist media are openly championing the Clinton Administration. 
<dd>Another aspect of our national "Tell the Truth!" campaign includes distributing hundreds of thousands of bumper stickers, pens, and magnets with the logo, "I DON'T BELIEVE THE LIBERAL NEWS MEDIA!" all over the country.
<dd> If you'd like to show your support for our "Tell the Truth!" campaign with one of the MRC's "I don't believe the liberal news media!" items call us at (800)-MRC-1423, and we'll send these out to you for a shipping and handling fee of $2.
<dd>We will also be opening an office in San Diego -- during the Republican National Convention. This year the media will not get away with their blatant distortions and outright lies against conservatives, as they did at the Houston Convention of '92. 
<dd>These are only a few of our plans. Much, much more is being prepared for our friends in the liberal press this year. Be on the lookout in <i><b>Flash</b></i> in the coming months for more updates on our "Tell the Truth!" campaign.

<center><h2>MRC Religion Report Generates National Discussion</h2></center>
<dd><big>S</big>urveys show the United States is one of the most religious countries in the world. Every year since 1952, Gallup polls have found that about 90 percent of Americans claim their faith is important. On the other hand, a 1995 U.S. News & World Report survey of Hollywood executives found that only 44 percent considered religion important. Another study revealed that 86 percent of  journalists seldom or never attend church, and 50 percent don't even believe in God. 
<dd>Does the product from the news and entertainment media reflect society's views? Not only do both the news and entertainment media not care about religion, when they do touch on it, they regularly attack it.
<dd>It's all detailed in the Media Research Center's third annual report: <b><i>Faith in a Box: Television and Religion 1995</i></b>, the most comprehensive study of its kind in history. Here are some of the findings:
<h3>Prime Time Entertainment Television</h3>
In 1995, there were almost 1,800 hours of original entertainment programming on ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, UPN, and WB, but only 287 religious portrayals. Overall, 38 percent of these depictions of religion were positive, and 28 percent were negative -- roughly a 4-to-3 ratio. This near-balance of positive and negative may satisfy secular Hollywood, but it offends tens of millions of Americans who cherish their religious beliefs. 
<dd>If it's a simple expression of faith, 77 percent of the depictions were positive. But the more serious the expression (and the one expressing it) the more negative it became. Religious institutions only received positive representations 31 percent of the time. Only 20 percent of the depictions of the clergy were positive, while a whopping 43 percent were negative! And the laity? Only 11 percent of the depictions of lay religious leaders were positive -- 64 percent were negative! 
<dd>There was a bright side. In 1995 we also had CBS's Touched By an Angel, arguably the most pro-faith show in television history. It's also a bona fide hit, the fastest growing show on their network, and the second fastest growing show on all of television!
<h3>Network News</h3>
<dd>The network news programs virtually ignored religion in 1995. Out of 18,000 evening news stories, religion drew only 249, and out of 26,000 morning news segments, only 224 dealt with matters of faith. For the third year in a row, religion stories again represented only about one percent of the networks' total coverage. 
<dd>The Catholic Church dominated what religion reporting there was, with almost half the evening news stories and 71 percent of the morning segments.  
<dd>In more political terms, the religious right was again portrayed as extreme and damaging to the Republican Party, even though it provided the margin of victory for the GOP in '94. As well, though not a single pro-life incumbent from either party lost that year and dozens of pro-lifers were elected to Congress, the media continued to report that pro-life policies were hurting the GOP. 
<dd>Stories about violence and harassment at abortion clinics drew another 142 stories in 1995. On the other hand, only three stories focused on the violence of abortion itself, or on documented examples of harassment and violence by abortion advocates against pro-lifers.
<dd>That television's treatment of religion has not significantly improved since the MRC's first study two years ago is troubling. The networks wonder why their audience continues to shrink, year after year. When will they begin to understand that their assault on religion is offensive to 90 percent of the public, and maybe, just maybe, might be a factor?  
<dd>Media Research Center Chairman Brent Bozell held a national press conference on April 4 to release <i><b>Faith in a Box: Television and Religion 1995</b></i>. The event was shown live on C-SPAN, and covered by CNN, CBS Radio, ABC Radio, USA Today, the Washington Times, and countless other outlets.
<dd>There has been a tremendous feedback to our work since the press conference aired live on C-SPAN. Viewers across the nation have thanked us for our work on this issue.

<center><h2>MRC's Family Hour Push</h2></center>
<dd><big>I</big>n this election year, with partisan wrangling everywhere, one issue is bringing together Republicans and Democrats: the MRC's campaign to restore positive values on television, particularly during prime time's Family Hour.
<dd>Senator Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Representative Lamar Smith (R-Tex.) each circulated petitions to their colleagues seeking their support. (Sen. Lieberman and Rep. Smith joined Brent Bozell on February 8 at a national press conference calling on Hollywood to voluntarily return to the spirit of the family hour.)
<dd>Thus far over 70 Senators and Representatives have signed an open letter, calling on Hollywood to voluntarily program only family-friendly fare in the first hour of prime time (8-9 p.m. on the coasts, 7-8 p.m. in middle America). The text of the letter was reproduced in a full-page advertisement in the April 30 issue of <i>Daily Variety</i>.
<dd>Perhaps the most eye-catching aspect of the campaign is the support it has drawn from across the ideological spectrum. Conservatives like Senator Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) and Representative Bob Dornan (R-Calif.) have joined liberals like Senator Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) and Representative Joseph Kennedy (D-Mass.) in backing the MRC's effort.  
<dd>Now it's time for us to target the advertising community. A letter is being prepared for the biggest advertisers on prime time television, asking them to join our Family Hour crusade. Watch this space for regular updates.

<center><h3>Unabomber: Really a Swell Guy</h3></center>
<dd>"I can't bring myself to hate the Unabomber. Quite the opposite; I find his story curiously affecting.[The manifesto] tells us what we all know: that American society can be a powerfully compromising, deadening, even saddening force...If Kaczynski proves to be the Unabomber, he is nobody's hero, certainly not mine. The bomber murdered three people, and might well have many more, all by design. Coincidentally, Kaczynski invaded our front pages just before Easter Sunday, mute, pathetic, and manacled before his captors. But maybe he accomplished what the Unabomber set out to do, to make us think about ourselves, and the society that drove him to madness."--Boston Globe columnist Alex Beam, April 10.

Dear MRC,
<p>
Love your FLASH news-letter! Your group is doing a much better job of keep-ing in touch with your members this way.
I did have a few suggestions:
<ol>
<li>List an E-Mail Address - Many people are like me, too busy or lazy to write a letter. I would love to see an option to send you E-Mail, you would get correspondence more often and it would be more current.
<li>Create a World Wide Web Site - This is a great way to publicize the organization. I get on the WWW often to keep track of other conservative organizations like the Christian Coalition, AFA [American Family Association], etc. I can get timely, quick info on these groups and interest in your group would be very high.
</ol>
Sincerely,
Mickey Mixon

    <TITLE>A Clear US Foreign Policy</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff">
<H3><I>From the Friday, May 31 Seattle Post Intelligencer</I></H3>
<H1><CENTER><BR>
Converging Trends Demand a Clear US Foreign Policy</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER><B><I>by Bruce Chapman<BR>
<BR>
</I></B><HR></CENTER>
<P>Incrreasingly, it appears that the United States of America lacks a coherent
foreign policy.<BR>
<BR>
Yes, there are exceptions. We do have a clear (and bi-partisan) policy on
foreign trade, consisting primarily of promotion of free trade agreements
and pursuit of violators of those agreements. But what is American policy
on preventing nuclear non-proliferation? A recently published Defense Department
report on the topic is long on analysis, but blurred on policy ideas.<BR>
<BR>
What about international narcotics trafficking? The U.S. has been de-emphasizing
eradication and interdiction of drug supplies, without expressing any rationale
for this change beyond a desire to concentrate on domestic use, as if the
two concerns were mutually exclusive.<BR>
<BR>
What, in the current U.S. view, is the proper role of the United Nations?
Our policy is completely reactive, with the U.S. failing either to lead
reform or to pay our $1.5 billion bill. We cannot even come up with a candidate
for Secretary General.<BR>
<BR>
Then there is the massive issue of economic development in the less advanced
countries of Africa, Latin America and Asia, a key to peace and stability
in the 21st century. Are we for more government to government aid, or something
else, and if something else, what? <BR>
<BR>
Seven years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, one still must ask, what
kind of life do we see for the former communist states--and what role do
we see ourselves playing in helping them to achieve it? <BR>
<BR>
Not for six decades--since 1936--has a presidential election year played
out with so little attention to international affairs. Regrettably, the
national Administration takes its leadership cues from polls and focus groups,
which, like the weather before a hurricane, give no sign of disturbance.
For the Clinton White House the significance of foreign policy pertains
mainly to domestic voter groups. If there is an American strategy anymore
it is a well-kept secret.<BR>
<BR>
In 1936, history shows, the United States courted disaster by ignoring war
threats in Europe and Asia. In 1996 we tempt fate again by not supporting
development of an anti-missile weapons system and by turning our military
into a social agency instead of a fighting force. On the day that an adversary
shows a capacity to infiltrate our defensive perimeter or to intimidate
one of our overseas bases--in Korea, for example--or simply starts a regional
nuclear war, it no longer will count for much here at home that the U.S.
military has been vigorous in implementing sensitivity training.<BR>
<BR>
But even if we could assume a benign world for American interests and the
cause of peace--and who will own up to such naivet&eacute;?--we still could
not avoid the reality that global opportunities, if not necessities, are
being slighted.<BR>
<BR>
Luck and past foreign policy successes have combined to bring the world
to a point of converging trends that Richard Judy, of the Hudson Institute,
identifies and which offer great potential benefits to this generation of
Americans. The most obvious is the globalization of the world's markets
for goods and services, a trend in which the U.S. is both an actor and acted
upon. To put this trend in perspective, exported goods and services in 1960
amounted to only 4.9 percent of our Gross Domestic Product. But last year
they came to 11 percent of GDP; and by 2010, they are expected to reach
35 percent. This trend alone is transforming our relative stake in international
relations.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps even more important is the globalization of capital markets, a trend
seemingly still unappreciated by many governments. &quot;Investors worldwide
are increasingly determined and able to seek the highest risk-adjusted returns
on their investments,&quot; Judy observes, and this freedom is coupled with
a staggering growth of private investments--through pension funds and other
sources--into economies world wide. Public investments in developing countries
now represent only a third of the total, having been surpassed in recent
years by private investments. Among the likely results are a closing range
of interest rates worldwide, international funding of more innovations in
products and services and a growing inability of national governments to
thwart the discipline of the free market.<BR>
<BR>
Coincident with these primarily economic trends are four others, according
to Judy:<BR>
<BR>
&#183; &quot;Globalization of institutions,&quot; including law, representative
democracy as a normative goal and acceptance in principle that &quot;private
property (will prevail) as the basic form of asset ownership.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&#183; &quot;Globalization of technologies,&quot; whether in transportation,
materials science, medicine, or such softer fields as marketing and management.
<BR>
<BR>
&#183; &quot;Globalization of information,&quot; which proceeds in part
from the technological trend. <BR>
<BR>
&#183; &quot;Globalization of culture.&quot; To a staggering degree, the
other trends of convergence support a long term change in value systems,
permitting gratified expectations of common commercial practices, language
(English), and even food availability and environmental standards. This
is also the trend with the most dangerous and explosive potential downside,
for most of the world--including even the USA--does not want to be homogenized
into some one-world culture-glob. In revolt against this trend come myriad
forms of paranoia and rebellion.<BR>
<BR>
These global trends, therefore, may be inevitable, but our success in shaping
them is not. It is folly for American officials to let public ignorance
of these developments determine government policy toward them. Whether from
peril or opportunity, foreign affairs is unavoidably domestic policy these
days and must be recognized as a higher priority in the national debate.
Where, we should be asking, do our political candidates stand?<BR>

They're Attacking Dale Foreman to Defeat His Ideas</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Bruce Chapman</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="starbar.gif" WIDTH="468" HEIGHT="25" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P>	State House Majority Leader Dale Foreman is a logical candidate for
governor.  He's smart, personable, and experienced. At 48, he's still a
fresh voice in politics, having been elected first only four years ago.
He's the easily-met, thoroughly decent kind of person you'd like to have
as a neighbor.  An attorney, orchardist and author, the well-rounded Wenatchee
representative has the political advantages of an earnest speaking style
and a natural bloc of support in Eastern Washington, which has long wanted
a home-based governor. He  has many friends, as well, in Puget Sound country,
where he grew up. Former King Country Prosecutor Chris Bayley chairs his
campaign.<BR>
<BR>
	 Like Jack Kemp, Foreman is a serious social as well as a fiscal conservative.
His several legal books include one describing the trial of Jesus. He also
has Kemp's redeeming grace for seeking an inclusive, welcoming Republican
party.<BR>
<BR>
	Most of all, the scholarly Foreman, better than anyone running, understands
the state budget. And he knows he wants to cut that budget.  He specifically
and courageously announced his intention to trim 10,000 jobs, and in the
campaign he has been laying out a plan for doing so. He believes efficiencies
also can be achieved through improved technology, where the state lags behind
the private sector. It is not a radical program, but a prudent, business-like
one that he realistically acknowledges will take several years to complete.<BR>
<BR>
	In fact, Foreman's &quot;Comprehensive Change and Reform Plan&quot; reads
as if he had pulled together the best ideas that such reform governors as
Tommy Thompson in Wisconsin, John Engler in Michigan and Christine Todd
Whitman in New Jersey have enacted in their states. <BR>
<BR>
	Selective pruning, notes Foreman, the orchardist, is especially overdue
in Washington State.  He points out that state government employment has
gone up more than 50 percent in the past dozen years--from approximately
60,000 to 97,000, rising at a rate twice that of population growth.<BR>
<BR>
	Unfortunately, the media has shown little interest in Foreman's proposal.
But that doesn't mean that word of Foreman's program hasn't gotten around.
His pledge to reduce the state payroll is exactly the kind of provocation
that excites active animosity from those who feel their jobs might be jeopardized.
And, sadly, some in the media, while mainly ignoring Foreman's policy ideas,
are quick to air personal attacks on him.<BR>
<BR>
	The charges began with allegations of infractions of the Public Disclosure
law, including largely technical matters, but also a remarkable claim that
Foreman, as Majority Leader raising funds to promote the GOP agenda in the
Legislature and only considering a run for governor, should have filed papers
then as if he already were a candidate. <BR>
<BR>
	This is new ground, a free speech limiting power grab by the staff of the
Public Disclosure Commission (PDC) that almost surely will lose in the courts
if the commissioners themselves pursues it. Once again the PDC will have
strayed far from its original mandate. But meanwhile, the issue assails
Foreman during the final weeks of the primary campaign--which undoubtedly
is just what the complainant intended.<BR>
<BR>
	Then there was the hot news tip--breathlessly reported--that Foreman had
been &quot;excused&quot; from some lawsuit ten years ago. Nothing illegal
or damaging there, mind you, just an &quot;appearance&quot; of an implication
of a suggestion, you might say. What mattered was not the empty story, but
the reporting of it. Where did the story come from and why didn't the media
tell us what the motivation might be?<BR>
 <BR>
	More recently, there was yet another story: that Foreman used irrigation
&quot;water-spreading&quot; on his farm in a way that had caused a dispute
with the Department of Ecology (DOE). It is one of those penny-ante accounts
that leaves the knowledgeable observer asking, &quot;So, what?&quot; But
it leaves--and is meant to leave--the casual observer musing, &quot;I don't
understand what this is about, but it must be really serious or the media
wouldn't be covering it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	Where's there's smoke, there's fire, people say.<BR>
<BR>
	Except in politics, I would say, where's there's sometimes only a smoke
machine.<BR>
<BR>
	In this case, it definitely was a smoke machine. But it wasn't necessarily
operated from within the DOE. Carol Fleskes, director of shorelands and
water resources at DOE, states that &quot;We're not the ones generating
this story.&quot; DOE and Foreman--who added five acres of land to his orchard
and is using the same amount of water as before to irrigate it--do differ
on whether he now needs a new legal claim or the old one remains suficient
under the law. &quot;Until that claim is verified by the courts it is hard
for us to take any kind of action to clarify the dispute,&quot; says Fleskes.
<BR>
<BR>
	It boils down to a minor jurisdictional issue. But somebody did want to
make a big deal out of the little claim. Why?<BR>
<BR>
	Because Dale Foreman's fiscal program, even with scant media attention,
is close to hitting a popular nerve. His talent and his ideas endanger entrenched
powers as well as some rivals. Therefore, the strategy: If you don't want
to confront a candidate's ideas, attack him personally. Or see that someone
else does.<BR>

</I><A HREF="twonation.html">[Go to Cascadia Tourism Conference -- June
6-7, 1996]</A></CENTER>
</H3>
<HR><BR>
These are heady times for entrepreneurs, high tech whizzes and international
traders. But many people are left out of the boom, including bank tellers
and telephone operators, middle managers and others whose jobs are being
rendered obsolete by new technologies, corporate down-sizing and international
competition. They can get jobs in this economy, but often not at levels
commensurate with their backgrounds.<BR>
<BR>
In the short term, there is no easy answer to such people's underemployment,
but there is one field that offers substantial opportunity for workers of
all kinds, from the minimally skilled to the highly educated. That field
is tourism. Paying an average of 10 percent more than other employment,
today's tourism industry is a source of good jobs as well as more jobs.<BR>
<BR>
Tourism matters to Washington State because the region is an increasingly
popular visitor destination, but also because Seattle is headquarters for
such top travel companies as Westin Hotels, Alaska Airlines, Holland America
cruise lines and, of course, Boeing. Unfortunately, state and local governments
have put relatively little emphasis on exploiting this strength. At 15.2
percent, Seattle has the second highest hotel room tax in the country--surpassed
only by Columbus, Ohio, hardly a tourist magnet. Yet, Washington State ranks
47th among states investing such dollars in development of the tourism industry.<BR>
<BR>
What's our problem? Perhaps we still think of tourism as a frill, or as
an industry with a real future only in sunnier climes. Or we fret that the
tourists who visit from Japan or Scandinavia will go home, quit their jobs
and move in on us. Neither statistics nor experience back up those concerns.<BR>
<BR>
How underrated is tourism? Well, how many of us realize that it is now the
number one industry in the world? The stunning fact is that tourism business
generated $3.4 trillion last year, even surpassing conventional manufacturing
categories like steel or autos. Seattle and King County stand to gain greatly
from this global development; our own annual tourism business has grown
from $900 million to $2.7 billion in the past decade. The number of foreign
visitors--480,000 last year--also has doubled in that period, not even counting
two million Canadians. But we can do much better.<BR>
<BR>
The foreign market, indeed, is one of the most promising. This is especially
so in Asia, where the middle class is doubling its massive size in this
generation--from 200 million to 400 million in India, for example. Worldwide,
women are becoming a bigger share of travelers now--already up to 33 percent.
Another trend: leisure visitors, rather than business travelers, will soon
account for 80 percent of air travelers.<BR>
<BR>
Analysts have found that these new international tourists are very cost
conscious--just at the point in history when the United States finally has
become more affordable. Moreover, 75 percent of current foreign visitors
to the US have been here before, so there is fresh curiosity about destinations
other than standard gateway cities like New York and Los Angeles. Seattle,
for instance: close to Asia, up-to-date, well-priced, and also friendly
and safe. <BR>
<BR>
Juergen Bartels, the new chairman and CEO of Westin Hotels, a company that
began in Seattle 65 years ago and today is a leading hotelier in 80 locations
around the world, was asked recently why Westin decided to remain here.
His response was that &quot;Seattle is not in the middle of the country,
but it is in the middle of the world.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Lest that sound like mere boosterism, the German-born Bartels is quick to
point out that the &quot;world&quot; Westin has identified as leading the
travel boom is the Pacific Rim, and especially Asia. Seattle is a good location
from which to launch an ambitious hotel expansion scheme like Westin's,
which aims to open 60 new hotels in the next five years, an average of one
a month.<BR>
<BR>
Seattle's position in international travel is improved further by our new
status as U.S. home to APEC (the Asian Pacific Economic Council) and the
prestige of the Henry M. Jackson School at the University of Washington,
whose international program is particularly strong in Asian studies. The
Port of Seattle's new International Conference Center that opens next summer
and the coming expansion of the Washington State Convention Center will
help establish Seattle as an especially well-endowed meeting location.<BR>
<BR>
What is missing so far, however, is a well-orchestrated, high priority effort
to build on this area's international tourism potential. We cannot and should
not count on the federal government to lead; its whole tourism budget is
only about the size of Luxembourg's, and nothing like, say, Canada's. In
Olympia, Governor Lowry and a couple of state legislators intend next month
to propose a doubling of the state budget for tourism--but that still will
amount to only $4.6 million, far less than the programs of neighboring states,
let alone, British Columbia. It's time for state and local governments to
see the full scope of the opportunity and to collaborate in meeting it.<BR>
<BR>
The best strategy is, first, to increase spending in tourism development
by tapping into the huge tax revenue provided by the tourist industry itself
in the form of the hotel tax. Judicious use of that source should not alarm
the general taxpayer and will return its investment manifold. When a modest
public and private promotional budget was deployed by the Seattle area in
Great Britain recently, it resulted in a doubling of British tourist visits
here. <BR>
<BR>
Pooling existing funds of government and private sector alike, as in the
British promotional case, should be the second emphasis of an international
tourism strategy. A common promotional campaign will go much farther than
many divergent ones. Indeed, we should solidify the tentative efforts now
underway to link the overseas tourism programs of the Northwest states with
the more advanced foreign visitors campaign of British Columbia and build
up the international appeal of the whole Cascadia region.<BR>
<BR>
Overall, isn't it time that we stopped looking the gift horse of tourism
in the mouth?

<H1><CENTER>&quot;Endless campaign a poor way to choose a president&quot;
</CENTER>
</H1>

<BR>
<HR><BR>
<BR>
In the recent dog days of summer, over a hundred people showed up at Seattle's
Washington Institute to meet one of the superficially more improbable candidates
for President in 1996, the articulate black Republican, Alan Keyes. <BR>
<BR>
A former Reagan Administration official, Keyes believes that the decline
of the family is the central problem in society, around which almost all
other problems revolve. His message went over well. He said he'll be back
soon. <BR>
<BR>
For so many citizens to appear at such events a full year before the 1996
national nominating conventions and fifteen months before the final election
might seem remarkable. But, decision time for activists is not next spring;
it's now. <BR>
<BR>
Presidential campaigns are being organized and financed earlier than ever
before. Competition to attract attention from candidates and the media has
encouraged states to set their primaries earlier and earlier on the calendar.
As a result, the first primaries next year will come in February. Only seven
weeks later, in April, over 80 percent of all public votes for delegates
will be over. <BR>
<BR>
If candidates waited to enter the race until the primary season was nearly
underway, as Dwight Eisenhower did in 1952, they would be too late to qualify
legally, let alone to assemble a team. (Attention, Gen. Colin Powell.) A
strategy like President Franklin Roosevelt's in 1940--when he did not declare
his candidacy until the eve of the Democratic convention--is unimaginable
in our time. <BR>
<BR>
Since Washington State recently moved its own presidential primary forward
to March 26, we, too, are suddenly part of the scramble. That and fundraising
opportunities are the reasons that candidates already are showing up. Sen.
Phil Gramm of Texas, Gov. Pete Wilson of California, former Education Secretary
Lamar Alexander and Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania have all flown in.
Sen. Dick Lugar of Indiana, who still thinks a coherent foreign policy is
important, apparently has decided that Washington could be a breakthrough
state for his candidacy and is planning several visits. Malcom S. (&quot;Steve&quot;)
Forbes, Jr., publisher of Forbes magazine (&quot;The Capitalist Tool&quot;),
may visit Seattle soon after a likely declaration of candidacy this month.
Now that our primary falls on the same date as nearby California's, even
the frontrunning Sen. Bob Dole is increasing his interest in Washington
State, according to his national political consultant, Don Devine. <BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, Washington is a must-win state for the Democrats in the final
election, so don't be surprised to see lots of President Clinton and Vice
President Gore. <BR>
<BR>
In the month of March in past presidential election years, we were all watching
the first primary. But next March, Washington State will be taking part
in one of the last of the important ones. Thereafter, the identity of the
two presidential nominees may well be known--and then we will fall into
the rut of a six month long final election drive. Spring's excitement will
be brief, the frustrations that follow interminable. <BR>
<BR>
If you believe that democracy benefits from some relatively quiet time between
spasms of political extravagance, this is not the way to organize our national
elections. Neither a sitting president nor his opponent is likely to behave
like a statesman when a campaign atmosphere dominates. Leadership suffers
when a presidency is preoccupied with the next election for a full two years
out of a four year term of office. <BR>
<BR>
When you consider that the first six months or so of a president's term
are absorbed in putting an administration together--another process elongated
in recent times--the normal tasks of governing actually are getting only
about a year and a half of our Chief Executive's undivided attention. And
the same is true for most of his would-be opponents. <BR>
<BR>
Americans don't hate these politicians. They just get very tired of them.
But, no immediate change is possible. Party rules and presidential primary
dates are already locked into place for 1996. <BR>
<BR>
The only cure for the coming epidemic of politics-fatigue is for citizens
in this election cycle to demand that the two major parties and Congress
push the primaries back to something like their old schedule for the year
2000. Parties, for example, should pass rules precluding the seating of
convention delegates that are chosen before, say, April of an election year.
And Congress should refuse to provide candidates with federal matching funds
until roughly the same period. <BR>
<BR>
In an era of instantaneous and ubiquitous communications, why should our
political system require five times as long to choose a president as it
did in the days of Grover Cleveland?

<title>Foreign Aid Recipients Consistently Vote Against U.S. in U.N. - Heritage PR</title>

<h2>FOREIGN AID RECIPIENTS CONSISTENTLY VOTE AGAINST THE U.S. IN THE U.N., STUDY SHOWS</h2>
</center>
<P>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<P>
	WASHINGTON, MAY 13, 1996</b> -- Despite claims by the Clinton administration that foreign aid bolsters support for America around the globe, nearly two-thirds of the countries that received U.S. foreign aid last year voted against the United States a majority of the time in the United Nations, according to a <a href=" /heritage/library/categories/forpol/fyi101.html">new analysis</a> by The Heritage Foundation.
<p>
	All told, 75 of the 118 countries that received foreign aid last year voted against the United States more than half of the time, reports Heritage Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/johnson.htm">Bryan Johnson</a>. "It's clear from the data," he says, "that foreign aid fails to win friends where it counts -- in supporting U.S. diplomatic initiatives at the United Nations."
<p>	The 10 countries that voted against the United States most often -- an average of 73 percent of the time -- will pocket more than $212 million in foreign aid this fiscal year. And of the 10 countries that will receive the most money, only three of them voted with the United States a majority of the time.
<p>	Some of America's biggest aid beneficiaries were consistently hostile to U.S. positions in the United Nations. Egypt, for example, receives more foreign aid ($2.1 billion) than any country except Israel, yet voted against the United States 67 percent of the time. And the country that voted against the United States the most -- India, 83 percent of the time -- is America's fifth-largest foreign aid recipient, pulling in $157 million.
<p>	Even Haiti and Mexico, two countries the United States has helped considerably, consistently opposed U.S. positions in the United Nations. On top of the $1 billion America spent on a military operation to restore democracy to Haiti, the island nation will get another $124 million this year. Haiti voted against the United States 60 percent of the time. The same holds true of Mexico, which benefited from a $40 billion economic bailout funded largely by U.S. taxpayers and is slated to get another $25 million this year, yet voted against the United States 58 percent of the time.
<p>	"Why is the United states spending so much money on countries that obviously care little about America's interests abroad?" Johnson asks. He recommends that Congress make significant cuts in the $13 billion foreign aid budget this year, even abolishing the agency that hands out most of the money.

<center><h2>ON EVE OF SUMMIT, ASIAN COUNTRIES QUESTION U.S. COMMITMENT TO FREE TRADE, ANALYST SAYS</h2></center>
<P>
	<b>WASHINGTON, NOV. 19, 1996</b> -- When President Clinton attends the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in the Philippines next Monday, he'll have some explaining to do. Specifically, he'll have to tell America's Asian trading partners why his administration seems so much less committed to free trade than it used to be, according to a Heritage Foundation policy analyst.
<P>	"The president's actions and trade policies over the past two years have dismayed America's trading partners in the Asia-Pacific region," says Heritage Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/oquinn.htm">Robert O'Quinn</a>. In fact, the administration's vacillation on free trade has damaged U.S. credibility so badly that one Asian leader, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad, has revived the idea of an Asia-only trading bloc that excludes the United States. 
<P>
	Open trade with the 18 APEC economies (including Canada, Mexico and Chile) is crucial to America's future, O'Quinn says. Taken together, APEC economies have a gross domestic product exceeding $13 trillion, or about one-half of the world's total output. Nearly two-thirds of America's two-way merchandise trade is with APEC countries, and exports to APEC countries provide jobs for 7.3 million American workers. 
<P>	For this reason, O'Quinn says, it is important that President Clinton take <a href="/heritage/library/categories/trade/asc144.html">specific steps</a> to reassure Asia about America's commitment to free trade with the region, including:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Asking Congress for "fast-track" authority to negotiate free-trade agreements without getting bogged down in contentious labor or environmental issues;
<P>
<LI> Bringing Chile into the North American Free Trade Agreement by the end of 1997, which would show other APEC countries America's willingness to embrace free trade with a country not on the U.S. border;
<P>
<LI> Inviting other Latin American countries, such as Argentina and Peru, to join APEC, which would shift the balance of power within the trade group away from the "go slow" countries of China, Japan, South Korea and Malaysia; and
<P>
<LI> Asking Congress to eliminate agriculture-export subsidies and the sugar and dairy programs, which would improve relations with a number of APEC nations (and save U.S. taxpayers $10 billion a year).

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=5>HERITAGE CALLS FOR CONGRESSIONAL FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<B> <FONT SIZE=4>WASHINGTON, NOV. 15, 1996 --</FONT></B> The 105th
Congress should take full advantage of the revolution in telecommunications
technology to make available on the Internet all disclosable information
having to do with the laws it passes and how it conducts its business,
a pair of Heritage Foundation analysts <a href="/heritage/library/categories/govern/bg1098.html">said today</a>.
<P>
 According to <a href="/heritage/staff/weinstein.html">Kenneth R. Weinstein</a>, director of Heritage's Government
Reform Project, and research assistant August Stofferahn, &quot;By
taking the initiative in placing all disclosable information on
the Internet, Congress could avoid the contentious process of
specific requests for materials as well as the necessarily more
complex freedom of information procedures established for the
executive branch.&quot;
<P>
 In addition, the analysts say, the move would provide a needed
reform. &quot;Through key institutional and procedural reforms,
the 104th Congress sought to unmask and dismantle the network
of liberal special interests that ran Capitol Hill for decades,&quot;
Weinstein and Stofferahn said. &quot;A Congressional Freedom of
Information Act (CFOIA) would complete and confirm the move toward
open access to Congress.&quot;
<P>
 In addition to areas that already have been opened to the public
through the Internet -- such as THOMAS, the Library of Congress'
on-line legislative information service, and the GPO (Goverment
Printing Office) Access system, which features 58 information
databases produced by the federal government -- the U.S. House
of Representatives' Task Force on Committee Review already has
recommended that Congress' new open-door policy be expanded. Specifically,
the task force has called for amendments to bills, committee and
subcommittee prints and reports, and oversight plans and activities
to be placed on the Internet. Similarly, the U.S. Senate has sought
to use information technology to publicize its activities more
extensively through its &quot;Operation Daylight.&quot; 
<P>
 But Weinstein and Stofferahn say Congress should go further.
Under a CFOIA, all information currently made available to the
public would become available through the Internet. In addition
to the committee documents detailed by the House task force, Congress
would add issue briefs, spending reports, voting records, the
content of mass mailings, financial and lobbying disclosure documents,
and a host of other items.
<P>
 &quot;Providing citizens outside of Washington with the means
to closely examine and actively monitor the work of their elected
representatives would do more to foster openness and prevent back
room politics than any other single reform,&quot; the analysts
say. &quot;The 30 million American families with personal computers
would be able to use the Internet to observe more closely the
activities of Congress and their particular representatives. In
addition, other citizens could take advantage of the numerous
possibilities for Internet access at work and at public and university
libraries to find timely information on current legislation that
may affect their lives.&quot;
<P>
 &quot;Overall,&quot; Weinstein and Stofferahn say, &quot;these
changes would make our democratic system stronger and more responsive
to the average citizen.&quot;

NEXT ADMINISTRATION CAN RESTORE 
U.S. FREE-TRADE LEADERSHIP IN LATIN AMERICA</h2></center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>

<p>


	WASHINGTON, SEPT. 25, 1996 </b> -- The most important trade goal for the next administration should be the creation of a hemisphere-wide <a href=" /heritage/library/categories/trade/bg1092.html">free-trade area</a> linking the signatories of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the South American Common Market (Mercosur), the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI), and other countries into a Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) by 2005, a Heritage Foundation analyst said today.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"Latin America has bounced back from the economic meltdown caused by the collapse of the Mexican peso on Dec. 20, 1994, but the United States has not," according to Latin America and Trade Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/sweeney.htm">John P. Sweeney</a>. "The democracies of Latin America have stayed on course with free-market reforms, trade liberalization and efforts to create an FTAA. However, the United States appears to have turned its back on Latin America, allowing U.S. relations with important trading partners to deteriorate significantly on issues such as trade, Cuba, drug trafficking and illegal immigration, and allowing countries like Brazil to fill the leadership vacuum."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Sweeney says U.S. reluctance to expand NAFTA to other countries such as Chile has not interrupted hemispheric trade expansion -- it has simply left the United States out. "Mexico has signed free trade agreements with Chile, Bolivia and Costa Rica, is negotiating its association with the South American Common Market (Mercosur), and soon will launch trade negotiations with the European Union. Chile recently became an associate of Mercosur and is negotiating a bilateral free trade agreement with Canada. Other countries interested in joining Mercosur include Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia. Mercosur also wants to sign a free-trade agreement with the European Union," Sweeney points out. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"No one is waiting for America to climb back aboard the free-trade express in the Western Hemisphere," he says.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Among the 10 steps Sweeney says the next U.S. administration should take to regain its leading role in the FTAA process and heal the recent rifts in U.S. relations with Latin America:<p><ul>
<li><b>Approve a new fast-track trade negotiating authority.</b> "No country will invest the time or human or financial resources necessary to negotiate a trade agreement with the United States if American negotiators cannot guarantee that any agreement reached will not be mutilated beyond recognition by the U.S. Congress," Sweeney points out. "Making renewal of fast track one of the first actions of a new administration and Congress would constitute a strong reaffirmation of America's commitment to free trade and would send Latin America a powerful message that the United States has re-engaged in the FTAA process," he says.
<p>
<li><b>Expand NAFTA to include Chile and the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) countries.</b> "The accession of Chile to NAFTA would reaffirm America's commitment to an FTAA with Latin America and the Caribbean, open a new gateway for U.S. exports in South America and the nations of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, and provide America with valuable strategic leverage in future convergence talks with Mercosur," Sweeney says. Also, NAFTA has enhanced the attractiveness of Mexico as a site for investing in manufacturing operations for export to the United States, causing the rate of growth for apparel imports from the CBI countries into the United States to fall from 25 percent during 1995 to about 8 percent for the first five months of 1996. Apparel imports from Mexico grew by 41 percent during the same period. To redress this unforeseen imbalance, Sweeney says, the CBI countries should be included in NAFTA. 
<p>
<li><b> Launch a dialogue for integrating NAFTA and Mercosur into an FTAA by 2005.</b> "The United States has squandered a two-year window of opportunity to influence the timetable and pathway for creating an FTAA, and Mercosur has emerged as a viable alternative pathway to an FTAA that many Latin American countries find appealing," Sweeney says. "Therefore, NAFTA and Mercosur should engage quickly in a formal dialogue with the goal of deepening and harmonizing trade practices as both groups take on new members. The ultimate objective should be to merge the two regional blocs into one hemispheric FTAA by 2005."
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"Although Latin America has recovered from the aftershocks of the peso crisis, and trade expansion continues unabated throughout the Western Hemisphere, the Clinton administration is reluctant to put the expansion of NAFTA back on track," Sweeney says. "If the administration does not halt its flight from free trade and the expansion of NAFTA, U.S. economic and security interests in the Americas could suffer a sustained decline."

<title>Poor Children Would Benefit From School Choice, Analyst Says - Heritage PR</title>

<h2> POOR CHILDREN WOULD BENEFIT FROM 
 SCHOOL CHOICE, ANALYST SAYS</h2></center>



<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>

	WASHINGTON, AUG. 26, 1996</b> -- As the new school year begins, Congress will be considering legislation that would allow tax dollars to be used for special scholarships so poor children can attend the schools of their choice, private or public. According to a Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/library/categories/education/bg1088.html">study</a> released today, such scholarships could make a real difference in the lives of children from poor families. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The proposed legislation, called Title II, The Low Income Educational Opportunity Act of 1996, would allow each locality to determine the value of the special scholarships, with the maximum value no greater than the existing per-capita cost of education in the local public school district.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"Public policy has made it difficult for all but the well-to-do to choose schools they prefer," says <a href="/heritage/staff/doyle.html">Denis Doyle</a>, senior fellow in education at Heritage and author of the study. "The  reason why the Clintons and the Gores, as well as other members of the nation's social and political elite, select private schools is simple: Empirical evidence clearly reveals that most private schools do a better job than most public schools, particularly with poor and minority students," he says.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	For example, Doyle says compelling research by the late Johns Hopkins and University of Chicago scholar James Coleman points out that Catholic schools have benefitted poor and minority children in numerous ways. Coleman's research found, for example, that Catholic school sophomores scored 10 percent higher in science, 12 percent higher in civics, and from 17 percent to 21 percent higher in mathematics, writing, reading and vocabulary than their public-school+ counterparts.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	A recent study by Harvard University and the University of Houston confirmed Coleman's research, showing that elementary school students who participated in the nation's first school-voucher program in Milwaukee scored higher on math and reading tests after four years than youngsters who stayed in public schools. In Milwaukee, 99 percent of the students receiving vouchers were black or Hispanic.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"Unfortunately for poor children, their only current educational choice lies in selecting between failed and failing public schools. The Low Income Educational Opportunity Act of 1996 offers a good first step toward giving poor children and their parents more and better educational options," Doyle says.

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations

<p>

	WASHINGTON, AUG. 21, 1996</b> -- A new approach to local police management emphasizing high recruitment standards, "community policing," and a high-tech focus on crime "hot spots" and repeat offenders -- coupled with a judicial system that keeps criminals behind bars -- can win the war on crime, according to a major Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/library/categories/crimelaw/bg1089b.html">analysis</a> co-authored by former Attorney General <a href="/heritage/staff/meese.htm">Edwin Meese III.</a>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
	The 33-page report, released today, proposes 21 specific actions local, state and federal officials can take to achieve the same dramatic reductions in crime that have been achieved in cities like New York, where in 1994 the murder rate declined 45 percent and major felonies dropped 12 percent (and 18 percent in the first nine months of 1995). 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"The gains made by New York and other cities in fighting crime have not been achieved by accident," according to Meese and co-author <a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">Robert E. Moffit</a>, Ph.D., Heritage's deputy director of domestic policy studies and the son of a Philadelphia police detective. "They have happened because innovative police officials have learned the lessons of experience and used them to improve policing." 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The most important lesson taught by the experience of the past several decades of rising crime, according to Meese and Moffit, is that police must be: 1) Well-paid, high-quality individuals in both achievement and character, actively recruited from the communities they patrol or from the military; 2) savvy peacekeepers, known personally by the neighborhoods they serve, able to spot troublemakers and, more often than not, quell disturbances before criminal acts occur; and 3) allowed to do their jobs, and not be constantly second-guessed by department higher-ups, nor demoralized by judges whose ideas of social justice put criminals back on the streets. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"If we're going to spend billions of dollars on combating crime," Meese and Moffit write, "we ought to use that money in the ways that have been shown to work and stop wasting them on ways that don't." For example, Meese and Moffit point out that the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994, which President Clinton vowed would place 100,000 additional police officers on neighborhood streets, has increased the number of officers by just 17,000, and even these aren't necessarily in areas hardest hit by violent crime.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Among the advice Meese and Moffit offer to local police:
<p><ul>
	<b><li> Target urban America's "hot spots" and career criminals.</b> "Successful police departments should focus on the decaying and disordered spaces where most of the nation's serious crime takes place," according to Meese and Moffit. "Research shows that more than half of all serious crime is concentrated in less than 3 percent of the addresses in an urban area. These areas should by the targets of short-term, unpredictable crackdowns that tell the criminal he stands a serious chance of getting caught. Police should also target urban America's tiny criminal class: the 6 percent of the male population responsible for about 50 percent of serious crime. They should be a routine target of police," they say.
<p>
<li><b> Good policing requires high recruitment standards.</b> "Too many metropolitan areas in the United States have witnessed a deliberate -- often politically motivated -- lowering of intellectual, physical and character standards within police forces," Meese and Moffit say. If local police departments expect to make a dent in crime, they need to insist on high standards in both cognitive ability and personal integrity. 

<p>
"Responsible officials should use standardized tests as an initial screening mechanism to evaluate the cognitive ability of recruits," Meese and Moffit say. For patrol officers charged with keeping order on the streets, "psychological evaluations and the ability to meet serious physical strength and stamina requirements are also essential," they say. Most important of all, "background investigations of recruits must include serious inquiries into their past behavior, their reputation for honesty and integrity, current and past associations and financial and marital stability, as well as evidence of illegal drug use or alcohol abuse."
<P>	<li><b> Police should be on the beat, not behind a desk.</b> "Instead of keeping order and enforcing the law, too many police officers are patrolling ineffectively or being employed in ancillary functions that could be performed just as easily by civilians or private agencies," Meese and Moffit say. These officers should be put "on the beat" and their administrative duties performed by clerical or other qualified personnel.  
<p>	<li><b> Aggressively recruit police officers from the ranks of the military, which would expand the number of well-qualified black and other minority applicants. </b> It is important that police departments reflect the demographic composition of their communities, especially in minority neighborhoods. This enables officers to understand the prevailing subculture, prevent and control community disorder, and elicit information vital to effective law enforcement, Meese and Moffit say. 

<p>
But local officials "should not be deceived by the false god of 'diversity' at the cost of excellence in the field." Instead, they say, local police departments "should aggressively seek out those members of minority groups who meet the high cognitive, physical and moral standards of the department, and offer them a pay level that will make law enforcement an attractive career option."	
<p>	The military offers a pool of personnel -- many of them minorities -- with many skills that would be useful in police work, they say. 
<p><li><b>Anchor the police in the community.</b> "The most effective police officer is an insider; someone local residents know and respect. Foot patrols should be established wherever feasible," say Meese and Moffit. Better still, "if the police officer and his family live in the community, policing becomes more than simply a job; it becomes a matter of protecting one's friends and neighbors." For this reason, Meese and Moffit say local officials should consider offering low-cost housing loans as an incentive for police to live in the neighborhoods where they work. 
<p><li><b>Make police commanders directly accountable for results and police conduct.</b> It is absolutely essential, Meese and Moffit say, for police commanders to be held personally accountable for the maintenance of law and order in their jurisdictions, as well as the integrity and honest of their officers. This method, strictly followed by former NYPD Commissioner William J. Bratton, resulted in "precincts that operated as miniature police departments," and managers who "rose to this opportunity with enthusiasm and creativity." </ul><p>
<b>What Washington Can Do</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Among the steps Congress can take that will truly aid state and local governments in combating crime, Meese and Moffit say, are the following: <ul>
<p><li><b>Block the appointment of federal judges who demonstrate an insensitivity to public safety, and reform criminal procedure so it once again serves the purpose of putting criminals behind bars.</b> The Senate, which approves nominees to the federal judiciary, should refuse to give its consent to nominees who have a history of rulings that result in the release of criminals. 
<p>	In addition to what it has already done -- putting a stop the federal imposition of "prison caps," which commonly resulted in the release of thousands of dangerous criminals -- Congress should review the impact of the Miranda ruling, the so-called exclusionary rule, and reform the law to allow a good-faith exception in the gathering of evidence during criminal investigations Meese and Moffit say. "As currently formulated, the exclusionary rule suppresses good evidence, causes good arrests to be thrown out, and contributes to the demoralization of police," they say. 
<p><li><b>Review all federal statutes dealing with crime, identify those that impinge on the legitimate authority of local and state law enforcement officials, and repeal them.</b> "Currently, there are more than 3,000 federal crime laws on the statute books: Hardly any crime, no matter how local in nature, is beyond the jurisdiction of federal criminal authorities," Meese and Moffit say. "The Clinton administration's 1994 crime bill added two dozen more ... Congress should begin to reverse this counterproductive trend toward the federalization of crime -- and allow states and cities to solve their own problems."
<p><li><b>Provide more flexible federal funding for local law enforcement, such as federal tax rebates to states for use in combating violent crime.</b> Meese and Moffit say this would enable local officials to tailor financing to those aspects of law enforcement that best meet the needs of their communities. Alternatively, Congress could make $10 billion in block grants available to local police agencies over a period of five years to target the areas hardest hit by violent crime, as proposed by Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla.</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"It is possible to achieve dramatic reductions in crime," Meese and Moffit say. "In New York City and elsewhere, innovative policing is having a measurable impact on crime -- again, not because of the numbers or mere presence of the police, but because of what the police are doing." 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	But success, they say, rests ultimately on intangibles as "courage and character, sound judgment, a solid knowledge of law and procedure, and an ability to apply them in ambiguous, often dangerous and difficult situations. Officials must realize that these qualities are essential in any person who is given broad discretion, armed with a deadly weapon, and pledged to serve and protect the citizens of the community."

<h2> THINK TANK ECONOMIST IDENTIFIES
<br>THE "WORST TAX OF ALL" </h2></center>

<u>Calls for Estate-Tax Repeal</u>
<p>


	WASHINGTON, AUG. 19, 1996</b> -- It may be absent from political radar screens this election season, but a Heritage Foundation economist has identified what he considers the "worst tax of all."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	It's the estate tax, and in a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1091.html">new study</a> released today Heritage John M. Olin Senior Fellow in Economics <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William Beach</a> says it should be repealed. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Consider the evidence, Beach says. The estate tax can confiscate a crushing 55 percent of an individual's lifetime assets, yet is so inefficient it may cost the government and taxpayers more in administrative and compliance costs than it raises in revenue. The estate tax slows the economy by encouraging consumption over investment and by keeping interest rates artificially high. And the estate tax punishes some of the very people "progressive taxation" is supposed to help: female and minority business owners struggling to enter the economic mainstream.<p>
<b>A Paltry Revenue Source</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Along with the gift tax, which requires payment of taxes on the value of lifetime gifts from parents to children, the estate tax brings in less than 1.7 percent of the federal government's total revenue. In 1995, for example, the tax generated just $14.7 billion in revenue -- but may have lost up to $11 billion, Beach says, as individuals shed their assets by giving them away to charities and others. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	One of the primary reasons for this paltry revenue figure is the extraordinary lengths to which individuals will go to avoid paying estate taxes, Beach says. Not only do individuals spend an inordinate amount of time and money on "estate planning," which has become a euphemism for tax avoidance, but when that proves insufficient they resort to the next defensive measure: spend as much of their money as they can. In this way, Beach says, individuals only pay tax on their wealth as income, where the top tax rate is 39.6 percent, compared to the maximum rate of 55 percent under the estate tax (which, on top of the income tax, results in a tax bite of almost 70 percent).<p>
<b>Spend It Before You Die</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	It doesn't even matter what they spend the money on -- cars, boats, second homes, even presidential elections. "The fact is," says Beach, "that the estate tax encourages the kind of strange world where it costs less for a millionaire like Steve Forbes to spend $30 million of his own money on a presidential campaign than to save $30 million for his children's future -- an investment on which he'll pay a 55 percent tax. The thinking behind this behavior is quite rational: Since you refuse to let me pass on my assets to my children, I'll spend them."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	It is this kind of behavior that also helps explain why the estate tax acts as a drag on the economy, Beach says. The more individuals spend and consume, the less they save and invest. What's more, to the degree that individuals do continue to save and invest, they demand higher returns [interest rates] to offset the steep future tax they will pay. This raises the cost of capital to businesses, Beach says, which translates into lower levels of investment in plant and equipment.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Perhaps most perniciously, the estate tax also hurts small businesses, especially those owned by women and minorities. Women re-entering the work force often find starting their own business the best economic opportunity, and minorities view businesses as a way to establish economic independence and give their children a boost up the economic ladder, Beach says. But businesses also constitute estates, raising the prospect that all the financial security these small-business owners have worked to achieve will evaporate once the owner dies. In fact, a 1995 survey highlighted by Beach showed that 58 percent of minority business owners believe their business will fail or have difficulty surviving after estate taxes kick in. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All told, there are approximately 16 million non-corporate family-owned businesses nationwide that may be affected by the estate tax. California, for example, has approximately 2.2 million; New York, 950,000; Texas, 1.6 million; Florida, 835,000; Illinois, 620,000; and Alabama, 208,000. In many cases, Beach says, these businesses won't survive the estate tax. The child who inherits the business will face such a crushing tax bill that the only viable option will be to sell it.<p>
<b>Repeal Would Boost Economy</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	In addition to chronicling the problems with the estate tax, Beach also asks what would happen to economic growth if it were repealed. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Using two respected computer models of the U.S. economy -- the Washington University Macro Model (WUMM) and the Mark 11 model by the Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates (WEFA) -- he found that repeal would cause the economy to grow by an extra $3 billion (WEFA) to $11 billion (WUMM) per year between 1997 and 2005.  This translates into job growth over the same period of between 130,000 (WEFA) and 145,000 (WUMM). Using the WUMM model, Beach also estimates that repeal would boost household disposable income by $12 billion over the nine-year period; generate 49,000 new housing starts in its first year; and lower the cost of capital to business by at least two-tenths of a percent. "These numbers aren't huge," Beach says, "but they also are low-ball estimates. It may be that repealing the estate tax would produce much higher economic growth."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	"In the end," Beach says, "the estate tax fails the cost-benefit test. Both the social and economic costs of the tax far exceed the revenue it produces for the government. If it were repealed, no one would miss it."

<h2> LEGISLATION CREATING NEW URBAN POLICY WOULD REVIVE POOR AREAS, ANALYSTS SAY
</h2>
</center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>

<p>




	WASHINGTON, JULY 31, 1996</b> -- Congress is holding hearings this week on the American Community Renewal Act, a comprehensive bill to bring economic and moral renewal to the nation's most impoverished areas. A new <a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/family/ib228.html">Heritage Foundation study</a> of the bill calls it "an excellent opportunity" to reverse 30 years of failed social policy.
<p>
	While the separate welfare reform legislation moving through Congress represents a step in the right direction, it omits many of the policy changes needed to aid the urban poor, says Heritage Senior Policy Analyst Robert Rector. By providing tax and regulatory relief to economically depressed areas and by boosting the role religious institutions can play in addressing social ills, the American Community Renewal Act would do much more to help the poor overcome the poverty, drug abuse, family disintegration and crime that plague their communities, according to study authors Rector and Policy Analyst Christine Olson.
<p>
	Sponsored by Reps. J. C. Watts, R-Okla., and Jim Talent, R-Mo., the legislation "rejects the premise that all that is needed for our poorest communities are larger government benefit checks," the analysts say. Specifically, the bill would make the following policy changes:  <ul>
	<p><li>Reduce regulations and eliminate capital-gains taxes on assets held in 100 "renewal communities" across the nation. Research has shown that reducing the tax and regulatory burden on businesses in impoverished areas can reduce unemployment by a third or more, the analysts say.
	<p><li>Provide poor parents with education scholarships that can be used to send their children to any school -- public, private or religious. "Giving poor parents the same choice in education enjoyed by middle- and upper-class families would increase parental involvement, improve the quality of education and reduce the rate of school failure," Rector and Olson say. And by allowing parents to send their children to religious schools, "the sponsors of the bill recognize that building a sound moral foundation is not only the most important aspect of a child's education but critical to solving social problems," they say.
	<p><li>Allow religious organizations to use federal funds to perform social-service work such as drug treatment. The social-science research shows religiously based drug-treatment programs are more effective than strictly secular programs, the analysts say. By prohibiting discrimination against religious organizations that have a proven track record of successfully treating substance abusers, Rector and Olson say, the bill would make the most of an underused solution to one of  the country's most pressing social problems.
	<p><li>Create a new charitable tax credit for donations given to charities whose primary purpose is to help the poor. "The bill's underlying philosophical premise is that individual taxpayers are better able to decide where funds should go in their local communities than are bureaucrats in Washington," the analysts say. "The bill would encourage Americans from all walks of life to become more directly involved in the basic business of financing social-service programs to help the poor."
	</ul><p>The American Community Renewal Act "gives Congress and the administration an opportunity to change the way the federal government has practiced community development for 30 years," the analysts say. "It respects the fact that low-income Americans want to help themselves, it builds on the successes of local organizations and community groups, and it harnesses the energy of the nation's churches and religious organizations in combating social ills."

<h2> TAKE GDP GROWTH NUMBERS WITH A GRAIN
OF SALT, HERITAGE ECONOMIST SAYS
</h2>
</center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>




	WASHINGTON, JULY 30, 1996</b> -- If history is any guide, the federal government's Aug. 1 estimate of how fast the economy grew in the second quarter of 1996 will be like most quarterly growth estimates of the past 20 years -- wrong. Probably very wrong.
<p>	According to a <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage/library/categories/theory/fyi114.html">new Heritage Foundation analysis</a> of the Commerce Department's regular quarterly estimates of gross domestic product (GDP), the figures released by the department's Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) have been off by an average of 50 percent during the nearly 20-year period beginning in 1976.
<p>	In some cases, the BEA couldn't even accurately say whether the economy had grown or contracted, economist William Beach found. From 1978 to 1991, for example, the BEA had to revise its numbers for 12 percent of all quarters to show that a "shrinking" economy had actually grown or that a "growing" economy had actually shrunk.
<p>	Citing the real effect the BEA's initial GDP forecasts can have on business decisions, Beach, the former chief economist for Sprint Corp., urges that the agency delay the release of growth numbers for at least 60 days, when fuller data will yield a more accurate picture of the economy.  "The federal government is forcing businesses to make decisions about jobs and investment based on faulty estimates of the economy's strength," he says. "In this regard, the GDP forecasts do more harm than good."
	<p>Frequently, the difference between the Commerce Department initial GDP estimates and the actual performance of the economy is extraordinary. For the first quarter of 1996, for example, the BEA initially said the economy grew by 2.8 percent.  Later revisions, however, put first quarter GDP growth at only 2.2 percent, a 20 percent downward revision.  More glaring was the error for the first quarter of 1992.  The BEA initially reported 2.0 percent growth, when later revisions showed the economy had grown 4.7 percent -- a 135 percent correction. 
	<p>The Heritage Foundation analysis found that the BEA underestimated the growth rate during President Reagan's two terms 63 percent of the time, while it has overestimated the growth rate 70 percent of the time during President Clinton's presidency.
	<p>Beach, Heritage's John M. Olin senior fellow in political economy, does not fault the BEA. After all, he says, estimating quarterly GDP for the huge and highly complex U.S. economy will inevitably require "guesswork." What he does fault is the near-obsessive focus on quarterly GDP by politicians and the media, since the numbers tell so little about the actual strength of the economy. 
	<p>To get an accurate picture of the nation's economic health, he says, it is necessary to look at longer-term economic trends.
<p>	The GDP estimate for the second quarter of 1996, for example, may look good on paper, he says, but will mask the underlying economic trend -- which is downward. Beach notes that economic growth rates increased significantly from the first quarter of 1992 to the final quarter of 1994, but have been on a decline ever since. The fact that both the expansion and the slowdown have been punctuated by "spikes" in individual quarters does nothing to change the overall trend, he says.
<p>	The lesson? "Americans shouldn't be lulled into a false sense of economic prosperity, or insecurity, based on how the economy is supposedly performing during a single quarter," Beach says. "They also shouldn't be fooled by the political posturing that surrounds economic growth numbers. What counts is the longer term direction of the economy, and right now it's down."

<title> Credit Goes To Congress For Lower Deficit, Analyst Says - Heritage PR</title>

<h2> CREDIT GOES TO CONGRESS FOR LOWER DEFICIT, ANALYST SAYS
</h2>
</center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations

<p>



	WASHINGTON, JULY 26, 1996</b> -- If Congress hadn't stopped President Clinton from passing his 1996 budget, rejected his plans for $200 billion deficits well into the next century, and pushed through substantial cuts of its own, this year's deficit would be nowhere near the $117 billion recently projected  by the Office of Management and Budget. In fact, <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi113.html">according to Heritage Foundation budget analyst Scott Hodge</a>, the deficit would have come in at about what the Clinton administration originally proposed for 1996: a deficit of $211 billion.
<p>
	"It is Congress that deserves taxpayers' credit for cutting President Clinton's proposed deficit nearly in half," Hodge says. "Furthermore, had the president not vetoed Congress' Balanced Budget Act of 1995, which included $17 billion in entitlement savings for fiscal year 1996, this year's deficit would be less than $100 billion rather than the $117 billion for which he now claims credit."
<p>
	Hodge says the domestic discretionary spending cutbacks pushed through by Congress in the face of White House opposition have gone practically unreported in accounts of the 104th Congress' legislative record. "Thanks to congressional pressure for program terminations and major cuts, fiscal year 1996 discretionary spending will experience its first decline since 1969," he points out. "More than 270 separate programs, offices, agencies, projects and divisions were eliminated completely. Many other programs, such as the National Endowment for the Arts, the Appalachian Regional Commission and the Legal Services Corporation, were cut by more than one-third."
<p>
	Other reasons cited by Hodge for the lower projected 1996 deficit numbers include:<ul>
	<p><li>The savings and loan bailout, which is now generating revenue instead of adding to the deficit. "This program -- which has accounted for 10 percent of the deficit change between fiscal years 1992 and 1996 -- is expected to bring in more than $15 billion in new revenue to the Treasury as assets acquired during the bailout are sold to the private sector";
	<p><li>New revenues from selling the electromagnetic spectrum. "President Clinton is reaping a windfall from the auction of telecommunications spectrum to private industry, estimated to generate more than $10 billion in new revenues for fiscal year 1996";
	<p><li>A one-time tax revenue windfall caused by "investors cashing in on capital gains because of the rise in the stock market and the possibility of an agreement between Congress and the White House on a cut in the capital gains tax";
</ul><p>	"At every turn, the Clinton administration has fought attempts to cut spending -- or even to reduce the rate of spending growth," Hodge says. "Incredibly, the president now claims credit for reducing the deficit to a 15-year low when, in fact, it was Congress that kept the president from pushing through spending that would have kept deficits higher than $200 billion for the foreseeable future."

<h2> GOVERNMENT VIOLATIONS OF PARENTAL RIGHTS
ALL TOO COMMON, HERITAGE STUDY SAYS
</h2>
</center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>

<p>




WASHINGTON, JULY 23, 1996</b> -- Legislation moving through Congress would protect parents from a growing number of government attempts to prevent them from raising their children as they see fit, according to <a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/family/ib227.html">a new Heritage Foundation study</a>.
<p>	With "parental rights" under siege on all fronts -- from legislatures, courts, government agencies, even the "helping" professions -- the "Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act" would restore to parents what the Supreme Court has deemed their "fundamental right" to direct the upbringing of their children, say study authors Patrick Fagan, Heritage's William FitzGerald fellow in family and cultural studies, and Wade Horn, director of the National Fatherhood Initiative. Fagan is former deputy assistant secretary for social services policy at the Department of Health and Human Services, and Horn is former U.S. Commissioner for Children, Youth and Families.
<p>	To underscore the deteriorating status of parental rights -- and the need for legislation to correct the problem -- Fagan and Horn point to a number of recent abuses:<ul>
	<p><li>Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., tried in 1994 to require parents who educate their children at home to obtain state teacher certification, a step that would have all but abolished a practice already recognized as a parental right;
	<p><li>The Massachusetts Supreme Court in 1995 ruled that local school boards could deny parents the right to "opt out" of sex education classes and condom distributions for their children;
	<p><li>The Michigan Supreme Court in 1993 denied "secular parents" the right to educate their children at home, even though it upheld the right of "religious parents" to do so;
	<p><li>The county of Durham, N.C., in 1995 drew up guidelines for determining the presence of child abuse in the home that could lead to investigations of parents for practices such as confining children to their rooms. The county also crafted a list of guidelines for "suitable" parenting, which included dictating such minutiae as what time parents must be home if a baby-sitter is watching their children (9 p.m. in the case of 12-14 year olds, for example);
	<p><li>A school nurse and doctor in East Stroudsburg, Penn., recently administered physical examinations -- including examination of the genitalia -- to about 60 girls aged 11 and 12, without permission from many of their parents; and
	<p><li>Even groups like school counselors and the American Library Association (ALA) have shown hostility toward parental rights; counselors by claiming they can counsel minors without parental consent, and the ALA by opposing parental efforts to prevent their children from checking out R- and X-Rated videos.
	</ul><p>Fagan and Horn say that even though the Supreme Court has ruled decisively in favor of parental rights, violations of those rights still occur with alarming frequency. To correct the problem, the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act (sponsored by Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, and Rep. Steve Largent, R-Okla.) would buttress the Court's settled opinion by clarifying parental rights to:<ul>
	<p><li>direct or provide for the education of the child;
	<p><li>make a health or mental-health decision for the child (with exceptions to "prevent an imminent risk of serious harm or remedy serious harm to the child");
	<p><li>discipline the child, including reasonable corporal punishment as defined by the Supreme Court; and 
	<p><li>direct or provide for the religious and moral formation of the child.
	</ul><p>The analysts are careful to point out that the legislation would in no way hinder states from protecting children from child abuse. Parental rights are fundamental, but they are not absolute, the analysts say. "No parent has a right to abuse a child," they say, "and the state has the duty to protect the child." The analysts say the real threat of child abuse stems not from the legislation, but from the "family preservation philosophy" of social workers who repeatedly try to reunite children with clearly abusive parents.
<p>	To those opponents of parental rights who will nevertheless raise the child-abuse issue, the analysts again cite the Supreme Court, which said in 1979 that "the statist notion that governmental power should supersede parental authority in all cases because some parents abuse and neglect children is repugnant to American tradition." 
	<p>It is this "repugnant" disregard for parental rights that must be corrected, the analysts say. The Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act would do just that, they say, "erecting a barrier against the mounting erosion of these rights."

<h2> STUDY SHOWS WASTEFUL SPENDING
STILL ABOUNDS IN WASHINGTON

        WASHINGTON, JULY 22, 1996</b> -- Even in an era marked by concern for how taxpayer dollars are spent, boondoggles still abound in Washington, according to <a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi112.html">a new Heritage Foundation study</a>.
<p>	In the second of a series of reports on "How Government Wastes Your Money," Heritage Senior Fellow in Economics Ronald Utt casts the spotlight on some particularly outlandish recent examples, such as:<ul>
<p><li>The 260 public housing residents, officials and employees of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) who took an all-expenses-paid trip to San Juan, Puerto Rico -- courtesy of the taxpayers. The official purpose of the trip was to attend the 1995 convention of the National Tenant Organization. But HUD's inspector general said the event showed a marked "lack of programmatic content." Perhaps, says Utt, that's because the participants were too busy taking advantage of the numerous amenities offered at the Casino Hotel and Sands Beach Resort: gambling, snorkeling, dancing, touring, shopping and a beauty salon. The total cost of the excursion: $325,000.
<p><li>The telephones at the Department of Agriculture, which were being used to make calls to adult phone-sex lines, many to the Dominican Republic. What's more, the General Accounting Office found that during one four-month period roughly half the collect calls accepted by department employees (nearly 600 calls costing $2,600) were from inmates at 18 jails and prisons, with many of the calls rerouted illegally to the department's long-distance lines. 
<p><li>The decision by the Federal Aviation Administration to install a sophisticated new radar system at 47 airports at a cost of $373 million. The problem: The system doesn't work very well. At the 16 airports where it is already in place, the system has suffered frequent shutdowns. Since it was installed at Washington's National Airport in January 1996, for example, the system has failed nearly once every week and has proven incapable of detecting dangerous wind conditions (as it was supposed to).
	 </ul><p>"Washington would like to think these stories are isolated incidents," Utt concludes, "but they happen every day. It's just too easy to spend -- and misspend -- somebody else's money."

<h2> AFL-CIO "VOTER EDUCATION PROJECT" VIOLATES WORKER RIGHTS, ANALYST SAYS
</h2>
</center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>


        WASHINGTON, JULY 19, 1996</b> --  The AFL-CIO's $35 million "voter education project" violates the rights of union workers by using their mandatory union dues to pay for political activities aimed at defeating Republican members of the 104th Congress, two <a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/regulation/bg1087.html">Heritage Foundation analysts said today.</a>
	<p>They called on Congress to allow union workers to choose not to have their mandatory dues used for partisan political activities. A bill to accomplish this, The Worker Right to Know Act, is scheduled for a vote in Congress July 24 or soon thereafter.
	<p>According to Kenneth R. Weinstein, director of the think tank's Government Reform Project and Research Assistant Thomas M. Wielgus, union members split their vote roughly 60-to-40 between Democrats and Republicans, respectively, in 1994. Since virtually all of the AFL-CIO's effort is aimed at unseating Republicans, this means as many as 40 percent of  AFL-CIO members may be forced to finance political activities with which they disagree. 
	<p>"Depending on the individual union and the accounting rules applied, union dues devoted to non-collective bargaining activities could range from under $200 to well over $1,000 per year per union member," Weinstein and Wielgus estimate. As things now stand, the authors note, unions are not required to account for how much of union dues are used for political versus other activities. Some unions don't even fully report the amount of their dues income to the government, they say.
<p>	What's more, Weinstein and Wielgus say "most union members may not realize that under the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Communications Workers of America v. Beck they have every right to demand a refund of the portion of their dues used to back political candidates or lobby for causes with which they may disagree." 
	<p>Under the Beck decision, unions must refund to their members any dues not related to collective bargaining activities, contract administration and grievance processes. Unfortunately, the Heritage analysts say, this decision remains largely unenforced. An April 1996 survey of 1,000 union members revealed that 78 percent did not know they had a right to obtain such a refund, and that once they realized what their Beck rights were, 56 percent would be likely to request a refund. 
	<p>To rectify the situation, Rep. Harris Fawell, R-Ill., has introduced the Worker Right To Know Act, which would require a union to obtain a signed agreement from an employee before using dues for purposes not related to collective bargaining activities. The agreement would offer a clear statement detailing the percentage of dues used for traditional collective bargaining and that used for other activities such as "voter education." It also would make it clear that if workers chose not to give a portion of their dues to political activities, they still would retain the right to participate fully in the activities of their unions.
	<p>"It is time to make workers aware of their rights under the applicable Supreme Court decisions and to make it possible for them to exercise these rights freely," the Heritage analysts say. "The Worker Right to Know Act would give union members the power to choose for themselves whether to give their money to political causes."

<h2> HISTORY SHOWS TAX CUTS BOOST ECONOMY, RAISE REVENUE, ANALYST SAYS
</h2>
</center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>




	WASHINGTON, JULY 18, 1996</b> -- With the 1996 presidential campaign rekindling the debate over taxes, a <a href="http://www.heritage.org/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1086.html">new Heritage Foundation study</a> says tax rate reductions historically have had none of the negative consequences ascribed to them by tax-cut opponents.
<p>
	Daniel Mitchell, Heritage's McKenna senior fellow in political economy, examined the three major periods of tax-rate reductions in U.S. history -- the 1920s, the 1960s, and the 1980s -- and found in each case that lower taxes not only boosted economic growth, but yielded the federal government more revenue and resulted in high-income Americans bearing a larger share of the tax burden. Consider:<ul>
	<p><li>In the 1920s, tax rates fell across the board, dropping from a top rate of 71 percent to 24 percent. As a result, the economy grew by 59 percent between 1921 and 1929, government revenue from personal income taxes increased from $719 million in 1921 to $1.2 billion in 1928, and the share of the tax burden borne by the rich ($50,000 and up in those days) climbed from 44.2 percent in 1921 to 78.4 percent in 1928. 
	<p><li>In the 1960s, President Kennedy again lowered tax rates across the board, reducing the top rate from 91 percent to 70 percent. In response, the economy experienced its longest expansion in U.S. history, government revenue grew from $94 billion in 1961 to $153 billion in 1968, and tax collections from those making more than $50,000 climbed by 57 percent between 1963 and 1966.
	<p><li>In the 1980s, President Reagan signed across-the-board tax cuts, paring the top rate from 70 percent to 28 percent. From 1982 to 1989, the economy responded with its longest peacetime expansion in U.S. history, government revenue grew by 99.4 percent, and the share of income taxes paid by the top 10 percent of earners rose from 48 percent in 1981 to 57 percent in 1988</ul>.
	<p>By contrast, Mitchell says, periods of tax increases have had a damaging effect on the economy.  He notes that since Reagan left office, the top tax rate has risen from 28 percent to 42 percent. The result: The economy has suffered its worst seven-year period of economic growth since World War II, with family income $2,000 lower today than it was in 1989. 
	<p>Likewise, tax increases imposed by President Johnson, combined with the "bracket creep" of the 1970s, caused the growing economy of the Kennedy years to lapse into a period of stagflation, notorious for rampant inflation and anemic economic growth. As for the 1920s tax cuts, they were followed in the 1930s by tax increases that boosted the top rate first to 63 percent, then to 79 percent. "To put it mildly," Mitchell says, "the 1930s are not remembered as one of the American economy's better decades."
	<p>"The economy is lagging, incomes are falling, and tax revenues are stagnant," Mitchell says. "History shows clearly that the way to reverse this trend is to cut tax rates."

CLINTON ADMINISTRATION RAISES WHITE FLAG IN WAR ON DRUGS, NEW HERITAGE STUDY SAYS
</h2>
</center>
<p>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations

<p>

        WASHINGTON, July 11, 1996</b> -- Dispatches from the front line of the war on drugs carry bleak news: The United States is going down to defeat, in no small part because the Clinton administration has failed to make combating drugs a high priority, according to a new Heritage Foundation <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage/library/categories/crimelaw/bgup279.html"> study released today.</a>
<p>
"After a decade of consistent progress during the Reagan and Bush administrations, almost every available indicator shows the United States is losing -- some would say surrendering -- in the prolonged struggle against illegal drugs," say study authors John Walters and James O'Gara, respectively the president and director of research for the New Citizenship Project. Walters previously served as deputy director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. 
	<p>Specifically, the analysts fault the president for lackluster appointments to key anti-drug positions, from the "invisible" former drug czar Lee Brown to the "embarrassing" former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, who favored outright legalization of drugs. In addition, the administration has cut staff at the Office of National Drug Control Policy from 147 to 25 and allowed 227 agent positions at the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to disappear from September 1992 to September 1995.
	<p>Efforts to interdict drugs before they reach U.S. shores also have lagged under the Clinton administration, Walters and O'Gara say. All told, interdiction flight hours in the "transit zone" between the United States and South America have dropped by 50 percent, and ship "steaming days" have fallen by a third. 
	<p>These actions reflect the administration's intentional shift in strategy away from drug interdiction and law enforcement toward therapeutic treatment of drug users, the analysts say. But the new policy has a price: Almost as soon as it went into effect, cocaine seizures by the Customs Service and the Coast Guard plummeted, from 51 metric tons in fiscal 1993 to 15 metric tons in fiscal 1994. During the same period, the retail price of a gram of cocaine dropped from $123 to $104, which, ironically, coincided with increased drug use among the very hard-core addicts the administration's new policy was supposed to help.
	<p>The result: Hard-core drug users are "cycling through emergency rooms at record rates," Walters and O'Gara say. Cocaine-related emergency room admissions in the first half of 1995 were 65 percent higher than in the first half of 1991; for heroin, the figure was 120 percent higher; and for methamphetimine the figure was an astonishing 321 percent higher.
	<p>Perhaps even more distressing, the spike in drug use under the Clinton administration is not limited to addicts and "hard" drugs. Citing research from the Department of Health and Human Services and the University of Michigan, Walters and O'Gara note that the number of kids age 12 to 17 using marijuana has almost doubled since 1992, from 1.6 million to 2.9 million. Nearly one in three high school seniors now smokes marijuana, and 12 percent of the class of 1995 had taken LSD. 
	<p>Given the administration's record, Walters and O'Gara say the appointment of Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey as the new drug czar is a step in the right direction but that much more needs to be done if the president hopes to retake lost ground in the war on drugs. Specifically, he should:<ul>
	<p><li>Use the "bully pulpit" to send a powerful anti-drug message to the nation's youth, something he thus far has failed to do;
	<p><li>Support anti-drug efforts in Latin America. For $50 million, for example, the administration could provide new tracking aircraft to Peru, a country that has proven its commitment to fighting the drug war by shooting down or disabling 20 trafficker airplanes since March of 1995;
	<p><li>Permit the Defense Department to spend more than the currently allowed 0.3 percent of its budget on drug interdiction;
	<p><li>Block future proposals by the U.S. Sentencing Commission to ease prison sentences for crimes involving crack cocaine; and
	<p><li>Allow federal funds to flow to religiously based drug-treatment programs, which in some cases are far more effective than programs where addicts decide how long and rigorous their treatment will be. 
	</ul><p>In the end, Walters and O'Gara say the Clinton administration cannot escape at least partial responsibility for America's recent losses in the war on drugs. "President Clinton has demonstrated little leadership on the drug issue and has failed to send an unambiguous message of disapproval to young Americans," they say.

<title>Average Household Faces $14,000 Tax Bill to Keep Medicare Afloat, Study Says - Heritage PR</title>

<h2> AVERAGE HOUSEHOLD FACES $14,000 TAX BILL
TO KEEP MEDICARE AFLOAT, STUDY SAYS
</h2>
</center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>


        WASHINGTON, JUNE 18, 1996</b> -- The tax bill for every household in America will come to $14,000 to keep Medicare afloat through the year 2005, according to <a href=" /heritage/library/categories/healthwel/fyi110.html">a new Heritage Foundation analysis</a> of the recent Medicare Trustees' report on the program's financial condition.
	<p>As has been widely reported, the hospital insurance portion of Medicare (Part A) will run out of money in 2001, at which point it will literally be illegal for the program to pay full benefits. To keep this segment of Medicare operating until 2005 will require a $400 billion bailout, or $4,000 in new taxes on every household in America, says <a href="/heritage/staff/butler.htm"> Stuart Butler</a>, Heritage vice president and director of domestic and economic policy studies.
	<p>The situation for Medicare Part B, which covers doctor visits and other services, is in many ways even worse. Under current law, the cost of Part B is paid partly by beneficiaries (about 30 percent) and partly by taxpayers (about 70 percent). Yet, if no changes are made to Medicare, by 2005 the taxpayer share of Part B costs is projected to rise to 84 percent. With Part B costs expected to total $1.2 trillion over the next 10 years, that translates into a taxpayer share of $950 billion, or $10,000 for every family in America.
	<p>Despite this bleak forecast, the Medicare Trustees balked at proposing serious solutions to the program's terminal financial condition, Butler says.  Instead, they proposed a "national commission" to recommend solutions to Congress.  But all this will do is "allow nervous politicians to believe they can avoid the issue of Medicare for a few more years," the Heritage Foundation executive says. By that point, "the choices would be more limited and the necessary action more drastic," he says.
	<p>Butler says Congress and the White House should act now to repair Medicare's finances by making three structural changes to the program.  First, turn Medicare into a "defined contribution" program, which would give seniors a specified amount of money to purchase health coverage instead of providing specific benefits.  Second, allow Medicare recipients to choose from a wide range of health plans, which would give them access to fuller coverage (prescription drug benefits, for example) and spur competition between plans to hold down costs.  And third, reduce the Part B subsidy for those who don't need it, which would correct a costly situation in which millionaire seniors get just as much help paying their doctor bills as those who rely entirely on Social Security checks to make ends meet.
	<p>Calling the Medicare Trustees report "grim reading," Butler says policy-makers have limited choices when it comes to fixing Medicare: massive tax increases, draconian benefit cuts, or structural reforms. "Only the third choice makes any sense," Butler says. "The quicker Congress and the White House begin those reforms, the less painful they will be."

        WASHINGTON, JUNE 14, 1996</b> -- It's one thing when Democrats attack the Republican-controlled 104th Congress for failing to deliver on its promises; it's quite another when Republicans themselves start believing the charge.  For the fact is, in the crucial area of making real cuts in the federal budget, the 104th Congress has rung up a remarkable record of success, according to <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi109.html"> a new Heritage Foundation analysis.</a><p>
	Consider: When the 1996 budget process came to a close, Congress had made real cuts -- not phantom "baseline" cuts -- in discretionary spending for the first time since 1969, says Heritage Foundation Senior Fellow in Economics <a href="/heritage/staff/utt.html">Ron Utt</a>.  All told, it eliminated 270 federal programs, agencies, offices and projects, reduced the number of bureaucrats at 29 of the 39 major government offices, and helped reduce the deficit to its lowest level since 1982.  <p>
	"Fiscal conservatives in Congress may have lost a rhetorical battle with the president over the budget," Utt says, "but they won the budget war." 
	<p>Specific programs Congress erased from the federal landscape include the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corp., the Office of Travel and Tourism, the Office of Technological Assessment, the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Bureau of Mines.  Spending for many programs and agencies Congress failed to eliminate -- such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development, National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) and the Legal Services Corp. -- dropped substantially.
	<p>Utt's conclusion: Congress' accomplishments were "far bolder than even the intentions of the early Reagan administration, which until now have served as the benchmark for ambitious fiscal restraint." For example, Reagan proposed cutting the NEA by 27 percent and achieved 20 percent, but this Congress slashed the arts agency's budget by 39 percent.  The same applies to the National Endowment for the Humanities, where Reagan's goal of a 23 percent reduction (he got 20 percent) pales next to Congress' 35 percent cut.  Similarly, mass-transit subsidies, targeted by Reagan for a 10 percent reduction, were cut 43 percent by the current Congress.
	<p>Granted, there's much more Congress could have done, and still should.  "As impressive as this Congress' performance was," Utt says, "it has only made a dent in the massive waste and redundancy that pervade the federal government." He says first on Congress' cut list should be out-of-control entitlement programs such as Medicaid and Medicare.  And while Congress found many opportunities to privatize federal programs such as the Naval Petroleum Reserve, another $8 billion to $20 billion could be saved just from privatizing the country's four "power marketing administrations."
	<p>With work well underway on the fiscal year 1997 budget, Utt says Congress' goal should be to shave another $20 billion off spending totals.  "This Congress cut discretionary spending for the first time since 1969," Utt says. "There's no reason it can't cut spending a second time." <p>

<h2> INS CONSIDERS "DUMBING DOWN" STANDARDS FOR CITIZENSHIP, ANALYST CHARGES </h2>
</center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>


        WASHINGTON, JUNE 13, 1996</b> -- This Fourth of July, 2,000 immigrants will swear-in as U.S. citizens at the World Trade Center in New York City, 10,000 will naturalize in Los Angeles a day earlier, and another 4,000 will swap their green cards for citizenship papers in El Paso, Texas.
	<p>Like the waves of immigrants that rolled upon America's shores on the eve of World War I, these immigrants have been immersed in the language, culture and history of their new nation, the better to help them become naturalized U.S. citizens. Now, proposals under consideration by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) would tamper with this highly successful assimilation formula, lowering naturalization standards and devaluing citizenship "like a worthless peso," according to a <a href="/heritage/p_review/jul96/miller.html">new article</a> in The Heritage Foundation magazine <a href="/heritage/p_review/">Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship.</a> 
	<p>Specifically, the INS is considering making it easier -- too easy -- to become a U.S. citizen, writes John Miller, vice president of the Center for Equal Opportunity. Not only is the INS studying whether to ease the English language requirement for citizenship, it is contemplating exempting entire classes of immigrants from the U.S. history and government tests newcomers traditionally have to pass. 
	<p>Granted, the INS has had to deal with a flood of new applications for citizenship -- 1.2 million in 1995 versus an average of just 230,000 a year in the 1980s.  But the way to cope with the volume of applications is not to lower naturalization standards to the point that immigrants begin to take citizenship for granted, Miller says.  
	<p>Yet that, he says, is what is happening. "Like a school that advances failing students to the next grade, the INS now pressures its examiners to push potential citizens through the system quickly, even if they are questionable candidates," he says.
	<p>To some organizations, this is a welcome development, because easy naturalization translates into political power. For example, Miller says, more Hispanic citizens means more Hispanic votes, which explains why the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials promotes easing naturalization standards. 
	<p>But such views not only diminish the value of citizenship, Miller says, they may also inflame the anti-immigrant sentiment that bubbles just below America's multicultural surface.  Citing a recent poll that shows 66 percent of Americans already feel America is no longer a "melting pot," Miller says a robust naturalization process is the only means the country has to "decide who is an American and who is not ... Without it, the cohesive United States resembles the fractured United Nations." 
	<p>Fortunately, Miller says, an antidote to the INS's lackadaisical attitude toward naturalization can be found in a Seattle program that puts immigrants through an intensive, 10-week course in the basics of U.S. citizenship.  Applicants who pass an English fluency screening are grilled in preparation for the standard INS exam, and are rewarded with an INS interview at the end of 10 weeks, compared to the usual six-month wait.  Particularly encouraging to Miller is the fact that the Seattle program -- which requires immigrants to give up three hours a night, four nights a week -- has a waiting list hundreds of names long.
	<p>Miller concedes the INS lacks the resources to run such a program itself, but then he doesn't want it to. Instead, he envisions a nationwide network of private and local public institutions that "would revive the old-fashioned idea of civic instruction for immigrant adults."  In this way, he says, immigrants can become Americans, and America can remain the melting pot it was intended to be. <p>

DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE BEARS BRUNT
OF GOVERNMENT "DOWNSIZING"
</h2>
</center>

<p>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>
	WASHINGTON, MAY 29, 1996</b> --As Congress and the White House lock horns over the fiscal 1997 budget, both sides should take note of an important fact:  Most of the government downsizing that has occurred so far has been in the Department of Defense. 
	<p>In fact, of the 200,000 government jobs eliminated to date, some 60 percent have been defense jobs. If one counts all federal civilian and military positions lost since the end of fiscal year 1992, more than 89 percent  -- almost 760,000 total -- come solely from the Department of Defense, according to Heritage Foundation Senior Defense Policy Analyst Baker Spring and Policy Analyst  John S. Barry, authors of <a href="/heritage/library/categories/natsec/bgup278.html">a study released today.</a>
<p>	Defense budget cuts, in turn, have led to a drop in private-sector defense industry jobs, according to Spring and Barry. By the end of fiscal year 1997, there will be 795,000 fewer such positions than in 1992. "In total, defense sector employment is down by 22 percent. By comparison, Internal Revenue Service employment has dropped by only 6 percent, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms [ATF] positions have dropped by less than 5 percent and Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] positions have increased by more than 2 percent," the Heritage analysts say.
<p>Barry and Spring recommend "restoring balance" to federal employment policy by:<ul>
<li>Freezing military personnel reductions at 2.4 million, the level recommended by the Clinton administration in its 1993 "Bottom Up Review" of U.S. military requirements
<li>Limiting further reductions in civilian positions at the Department of Defense to those achieved through privatization efforts
<li>Increasing a defense procurement budget that has fallen by more than two-thirds in inflation-adjusted dollars since 1985, severely damaging America's future military readiness. The steady stream of procurement cuts have cost 1.3 million defense industry jobs since the defense employment peak in 1987
<li>Concentrating federal work force reductions within non-defense departments by eliminating unnecessary and outdated federal programs and agencies.</ul>
	<p>"President Clinton's federal employment policy is unbalanced. One department, the Department of Defense, bears a disproportionate share of personnel reductions. The American people do not need federal bureaucrats from agencies such as the IRS, EPA and ATF watching their every move. They do need the sort of skilled people that contributed to victory over Iraq in the Persian Gulf War," write Spring and Barry.

<title>Legal-Aid Groups Defy Ban on Lobbying and Helping Criminals, Study Says - Heritage PR</title>

LEGAL-AID GROUPS DEFY BAN ON LOBBYING
AND HELPING CRIMINALS, STUDY SAYS  </h2>
</center>

<p>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>
	WASHINGTON, MAY 21, 1996</b> -- Faced with new rules that prevent them from lobbying and defending drug dealers and illegal aliens, groups that use taxpayer dollars to provide legal assistance to the poor have devised a number of loopholes allowing them to continue these banned activities, <a href="/heritage/library/categories/crimelaw/bgup276.html">according to a new report</a> from The Heritage Foundation.
	<p>Rules imposed by Congress last year bar groups that receive grants from the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) from using any part of their budget -- including private funds -- to lobby against welfare reform, file class-action lawsuits, represent criminals, and engage in other politically motivated activities. The new rules were necessary, says Kenneth Boehm, chairman of the National Legal and Policy Center and author of the report, because "in the past legal services lawyers could evade virtually any congressionally imposed restriction by using, or claiming to use, their own money for prohibited activities."  
<p>	But with this loophole now closed, Boehm says, legal services groups have invented a new evasive tactic: They swear off banned activities in order to remain eligible for federal money, then set up new shadow organizations that will use the groups' non-federal money to pursue a political agenda.  
<p>	For example, the Philadelphia Legal Assistance Center was recently formed by 12 lawyers from Community Legal Services (CLS), which receives money from the LSC. The new center, housed in the same building as CLS, will handle non-prohibited cases and receive taxpayer subsidies; CLS, meanwhile, will continue to handle prohibited political and ideological cases. "The possibility that former LSC grantees and new grantees will share office space and even staff means that, once again, it will be difficult to ascertain whether federal funds are being misused," Boehm says.
<p>	Legal services lawyers also have incurred the wrath of Congress for representing drug dealers who face eviction from public housing projects. Boehm cites a case pending in New York City where representatives of the city's 500,000 public housing tenants have sided with the New York Housing Authority in support of expedited evictions of drug dealers. Defending the drug dealers is the Legal Aid Society, which is supposed to use the federal money it receives from the LSC to represent the interests of the poor. 
<p>	With Congress likely to impose a new round of tough restrictions to deal with this problem, the LSC board defensively drafted a new regulation that supposedly bans legal groups receiving federal funds from representing drug dealers facing eviction, Boehm says. The problem, once again, is that the regulation is so full of loopholes it does nothing to deter a legal services lawyer from participating in drug-eviction cases, he says.
<p>	The ability of legal services groups to flout attempts to rein in their political activities is evidence to Boehm that Congress was right last year when it decided to end all federal funding for the LSC by 1998. Besides, he notes, the LSC has been successful raising funds for its activities from other sources, blunting the charge that elimination of federal funding would deny legal services to the poor. For example, the LSC will receive $278 million from the federal government this year, down from $400 million last year, a substantial cut. Yet the LSC also collects $250 million a year from non-federal sources, Boehm says, raising the question of whether federal funding is needed in the first place.
<p>	When the bill that funds the LSC for fiscal year 1997 comes to the floor of the House of Representatives, the Republican leadership is expected to leave open the option of "zeroing out" the agency -- something Boehm says would be a wise policy decision. "The 104th Congress took major steps to reduce the tendency of legal services groups to pursue frivolous and politically charged lawsuits at taxpayer's expense," Boehm says. Now, he says, "it is past time for Congress to eliminate all federal funding for this program."

Ever-Increasing "Tax Wedge" 
Between Labor Costs And Wages

<P>
	WASHINGTON, MAY 17, 1996</b> -- Instead of increasing the minimum wage, which would only destroy jobs, lawmakers addressing worker anxiety over lower take-home pay should reduce the costs imposed by government on employers, Heritage Foundation analysts <a href="/heritage/library/categories/theory/fyi102.html">said today</a>.
<p>	"There is a huge 'wedge' between what employers pay out to hire and maintain a worker and the amount of money that actually reaches the worker in the form of a paycheck," according to Rebecca Lukens Fellow in Labor Policy <a href="/heritage/staff/wilson.htm">Mark Wilson</a> and <a href="/heritage/staff/antonel.htm">Angela Antonelli</a>, deputy director for economic policy. "These costs are taking an ever-increasing bite out of personal income. If Americans had to write a monthly check for each tax and government-mandated benefit, they would quickly understand how government excess consumes their take-home pay."
<p>	For example, the analysts point out that in 1995 private-industry employers paid an average of $17.10 per hour to hire and keep a worker on their payrolls. But after deducting the cost of government-mandated benefits, taxes and optional benefits, workers took home an average of only $9.84 per hour, 42 percent less that the total cost of employing them. "The total tax wedge (government-mandated benefit costs plus taxes) cost workers an average of $4.00 per hour, or 23 percent of their total compensation," the analysts say.
<p>	For minimum-wage workers, the "wedge" is just as bad: In 1995, it cost a typical employer at least $4.76 per hour to hire such a worker. But after the cost of government-mandated benefits and taxes ($1.03 per hour) is deducted, and the Earned Income Tax Credit is added, this worker took home only $3.73 per hour, or 22 percent less than the total cost of their employment, and 12 percent less than the cash wage of $4.25.
<p>	These figures do not include the hidden cost of federal regulations. One study cited by the analysts estimates the regulatory burden per employee, on average, to be in the range of $3,000 to $4,000 per year. "This equals somewhere between $1.40 to $2.00 per hour for a full-time worker," the analysts say.
<p>	"The solution to this problem is not more government mandates, such as job-killing increases in the minimum wage," say Wilson and Antonelli. Instead, "Government should pursue policies that directly reduce the wedge between compensation and take-home pay." Such policies -- cuts in payroll and income taxes, reductions in the regulatory burden on businesses, a cut in the capital gains tax -- also would promote economic growth and thereby increase productivity, job opportunities and real earnings.	  
<p>	"Politicians who blame 'corporate greed' for what is happening to the take-home pay of American workers are diverting attention from the real problem: an overly intrusive and expensive federal government," the Heritage analysts say.

Congress, White House
Urged to Boost Spending

<p>
	WASHINGTON, MAY 16, 1996</b> -- The refusal of the White House to adequately fund its own national security programs is undermining America's ability to guarantee victory in defense of its freedom and global interests, a <a href=" /heritage/library/categories/natsec/bg1083.html">new Heritage Foundation study</a> says.
<P>	Even the passage by the House yesterday of a defense budget $12 billion higher than what President Clinton has requested for fiscal year 1997 is not enough, not when the White House has underfunded its own military strategy by $130 billion over the next six years, Heritage Senior Policy analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/spring.htm">Baker Spring</a> calculates. The Senate, Spring says, has an opportunity to begin to correct the administration's grave funding shortfall when it considers the fiscal 1997 Defense Authorization Bill in the coming days.
<p>	Spring says the existing gap between what is needed to fund the administration's military strategy -- which calls for the United States to be able to fight two Persian Gulf-sized wars "nearly simultaneously" -- and actual spending plans will leave the United States unable to fulfill its commitment to security alliances in Europe, Asia and elsewhere.  He estimates that under the president's defense budget fighting just one Persian Gulf-sized war in the future would require 87 percent of America's army divisions and 75 percent of its aircraft-carrier battle groups, leaving little left to fight a second conflict and uphold security commitments.
<p>	While Congress has attempted to provide adequate funding for the administration's defense plan in the short term, it has failed to address the long-term implications of the budget shortfall on U.S. military strategy, Spring says.  Despite the House-approved increase in defense spending for the coming fiscal year, Congress' overall defense budget actually would spend less than what the White House proposes in 2001 and 2002, he says.  Even last year's decision by Congress to spend $7 billion more on defense than the White House, while politically costly, fell far short of the $20 billion Spring says is necessary to fully fund the administration's defense plan.
<p>	By way of example, Spring notes that Operation Desert Storm required seven active army divisions and six aircraft-carrier battle groups.  Yet the administration's defense budget, Spring estimates, provides for only eight of each.  The result: If a U.S. ally in the Persian Gulf were attacked by either Iran or Iraq, the United States could respond but could not also maintain its commitments elsewhere in the world.
<p>	Although critics claim reductions in military spending are only natural now that the Cold War is over, Spring notes that those reductions are being made without regard for the fact that U.S. security commitments to NATO, Japan and others remain intact.  "All of these commitments place an extraordinary drain on the resources of the armed services," he says.  Without increased defense spending, up to the level needed to fund the administration's military strategy, "the time is rapidly approaching when this mismatch may force the nation to abandon at least some of its security commitments." 
<p>	The task for Congress, Spring says, is to begin a national debate over the proper role and size of America's defense forces.  To stimulate such a debate, Spring offers a draft resolution that Congress could consider, outlining in detail a global defense strategy and the specific force levels necessary to fulfill that strategy -- down to the number of troops, ships and aircraft required.  The resolution could be considered as an amendment to the Senate Defense Authorization Bill, he says.  
<p>	But the time to begin the debate is now, Spring says, for if defense spending is left at current levels it could well mean "the end of America as a global military power ... and the beginning of a new age of insecurity of the sort Americans have not known since the first half of this century."

<title>Congress Should Back White House Plan to Let Poor Move Out of Public Housing - Heritage PR</title>

<h2>CONGRESS SHOULD BACK WHITE HOUSE PLAN TO LET POOR MOVE OUT OF PUBLIC HOUSING, ANALYST SAYS</h2>

<P>
	WASHINGTON, MAY 7, 1996</b> -- Congress should end antiquated housing policies that concentrate the poor in deteriorating neighborhoods and embrace a Clinton administration plan that gives tenants a choice of where to live, a Heritage Foundation analyst says in a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/bg1081.html">study</a> released today. 
<p>	"To his credit, President Clinton's fiscal year 1996 budget proposed to shift virtually all housing assistance from projects to tenant-based vouchers that let the poor rent the housing of their choice," says Ronald Utt, a visiting fellow at the prominent think tank.   
<p>	Yet rather than embrace what Utt calls the most innovative housing-reform proposal in 25 years, Congress drafted new legislation that largely preserves the current system of public-housing projects. While such a move is sure to please the construction and public-housing lobbies, he says, it guarantees that thousands of poor families will remain trapped in substandard government apartments.
<p>	Under the president's plan, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) would end multibillion-dollar payments to public housing authorities (PHAs) and replace them with vouchers going directly to tenants living in housing projects. Utt says tenants then would have a range of options: continue to rent housing from the PHA, rent better housing elsewhere, or join with other tenants to hire better project managers. The end result is that PHAs would be stripped of their government-sponsored monopoly and forced to compete for tenants by offering better service at a competitive price. 
<p>	But Congress is blocking the reform, Utt says, devoting much-needed funds to traditional public housing projects rather than to vouchers. For example, the $2.5 billion proposed by the Senate appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over HUD to modernize housing projects could have provided vouchers to more than 475,000 poor families. Another example: HUD plans to spend $115 million in Baltimore to construct just 338 new housing units, money that could provide a year's worth of safe, decent, privately-owned apartments to as many as 80 percent of the 25,000 poor families on the city's housing-assistance waiting list.
<p>	On average, Utt estimates, project-based assistance costs twice as much as vouchers for each family helped. Instead of empowering tenants, such an approach enriches local bureaucracies at the expense of both the poor and the taxpayers, he says.  
<P>	Vouchers, by contrast, would allow poor families to rent the housing of their choice, as long as the rent stays within established limits. "This freedom allows assisted families to escape the worst urban communities," Utt says. "Families can move to safer neighborhoods with better schools, the unemployed can move where the jobs are, and the elderly can move closer to their families and shopping." 
<p>	"Congress needs to seriously reconsider its preservation of the status quo in public housing," Utt says. Project-based housing is a proven failure, he says, resulting in the warehousing of large concentrations of the poor in dismal neighborhoods marked by high crime, drug abuse, child neglect and other pathologies. Far better, he says, to switch to a voucher system giving the poor the freedom to live where they want.

<CENTER><B><h2>PHILLIPS FOUNDATION ANNOUNCES 1996 JOURNALISM FELLOWSHIPS</h2>
<h3>$50,000 GOLD AWARD AND $20,000 SILVER AWARD</h3><br>
<hr size=3 width=50%></center><p>
Potomac, MD, May 7, 1996</b> -- The Phillips Foundation today announced the winners of its 1996 journalism fellowship awards.  Stacy Mattingly captured the $50,000 Gold Award for her proposal to write a book on a highly-charged school prayer case in northern Mississippi.  Daniel Richardson won the $20,000 silver award to write a series of articles on the growing Patriot movement in America.  
<p>
Mattingly and Richardson were introduced during an awards dinner last night at the University Club in Washington, D.C., attended by prominent journalists.
<p>
During her one-year fellowship which commences on September 1, 1996, Stacy Mattingly will research and write a book on <I>Lisa Herdahl v. Pontotoc County</I>, a Mississippi school prayer case currently in the courts.  Last year, she wrote an extensive article on the case for <I>The Oxford American </I>magazine in Mississippi.  She has spent a great deal of time in Pontotoc County, and her article was widely praised as the most thorough and balanced reporting on the case.  She will write a book in narrative form, beginning with the Herdahl family's move 
from Wisconsin to Mississippi and ending with the trial on the school prayer case.
<p>
Mattingly, 25, is a freelance journalist based in Atlanta.  She writes articles for <I>Crisis</I> magazine and the <I>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</I>.  She served as contributing editor and writer for <I>The Oxford American</I> and as staff reporter for <I>The Oxford Eagle</I> newspaper.  She graduated from Northwestern University with a B.A. in English.
<p>
For his fellowship project, Daniel Richardson will focus on the Patriot movement in this country.  He believes the Patriot "subculture" is becoming too large to be ignored.  He will investigate the many groups which comprise the Patriot subculture, and he will examine the single defining thread running through all Patriot ideas:  the subversion of the Constitution by internal and external foes leading to greater government authority at the expense of individual freedoms.
<p>
Richardson, 23, is a freelance journalist in Gresham, Oregon.  He writes articles and news stories for <I>The Oregon City News</I> and <I>East County Magazine</I> in Gresham.  He graduated from the University of Puget Sound last year with a B.A. in History.  For his senior thesis, he wrote "A Military History of the Hundred Years' War."
<p>
The Phillips Foundation is a non-profit organization founded in 1990 to advance the cause of objective journalism.  The Foundation established its journalism fellowship program in 1994 to provide annual grants for journalism projects supportive of American culture and a free society.  The fellowship program is open to working journalists with less than five years of professional experience.
<p>
The three Trustees of the Phillips Foundation served as judges for the competition.  The Trustees are:  Thomas L. Phillips, President of Phillips Publishing International, Inc.; Robert D. Novak, prominent national journalist and author of one of the longest running syndicated columns in the country; and Alfred S. Regnery, a Washington attorney and President of Regnery Publishing, Inc., a Washington, D.C.-based book publishing firm.

Clear "Intervention Criteria" Needed
<p>
	WASHINGTON, MAY 2, 1996</b> -- The United States has been squandering its limited military resources on "missions without a purpose" around the globe, making it difficult for American forces to keep up with their other security commitments, the Heritage Foundation's chief foreign policy spokesman said today.
<P>	According to <a href="/heritage/staff/holmes.htm">Kim Holmes</a>, the think tank's vice president and director of foreign policy and defense studies, the Clinton White House desperately needs to formulate, spell out and "codify" a policy on where, when, and under what circumstances the United States will intervene militarily in the future.
<p>	Congress, meanwhile, should reassert its "oversight" responsibilities in this area, he said.
<p>
<b>Intervention Criteria</b>
<p>	Holmes made his remarks during a briefing on a new Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/library/categories/natsec/bg1079.html">policy paper</a> on American military intervention. Written by Defense Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/hillen.html">John Hillen</a>, a decorated Gulf War veteran, the report says any U.S. decision to intervene militarily should be based on whether U.S. interests are at stake, America's ability to decisively affect the outcome, and the resources available for the task. 

<p>	Hillen proposes five criteria for determining whether and how the United States should intervene in any given situation:
<p>
<b>	1) Whether national security interests are at stake. </b>
<P>	The United States, Hillen says, must be able to distinguish between such vital interests as "protecting America's territory, borders and airspace" and other interests "that are merely important or marginal." Not all American interests are "high priority" national security interests that must be defended through military intervention, he stresses. 
<p>	The United States should always be prepared to use military force to defend its vital interests, Hillen says. But since U.S. military resources -- both tangible assets such as troops, carrier battle groups, fighter wings, and spare parts and equipment, and intangibles such as "public support" -- are available only in limited supply, the president must realize that not all interests are equally important and choose wisely where and when to dispatch U.S. troops.
<p>	America's vital interests, he says, include: protecting America's territory, borders and airspace; protecting American citizens at home and abroad; preventing a "major-power" threat to Europe, East Asia or the Persian Gulf; preventing "hostile interference by an outside power" in the Western Hemisphere; and ensuring access to foreign trade and resources.
<p><b>	2) Whether the proposed intervention will "jeopardize the ability of the United States to meet more important security commitments."</b>
<p>	There is "an enormous gap," Hillen says, between America's national commitments and objectives and the military resources available to achieve them. 
<p>	The administration's own proposed military force, (presented in the Pentagon's "Bottom-Up Review" of U.S. military readiness) is not only "inadequate" for America's stated strategy, but is underfunded by an estimated $150 billion over five years. Such a force, he says, simply can't do everything the administration expects it to do. 
<p>	"Military interventions in support of peripheral interests," he says, "should never come at the expense of an American military force trained for and capable of protecting vital interests -- a perilous situation that many believe the United States is rapidly approaching today."
<p><b>	3) Whether the military goals are clearly defined, decisive, attainable and sustainable.</b>
<p>	Military objectives, Hillen stresses, should support political objectives. "For instance, in the Gulf War, the military objective was to expel the Iraqi Army from ... Kuwait. When the U.S. military accomplished that task ... the political objective was also ensured: Kuwait was liberated and its national sovereignty restored." 
<p>	While "working towards clearly defined goals may seem a rather obvious point," Hillen says, the Clinton administration has consistently done otherwise. Indeed, when U.S. troops were sent to Haiti and Bosnia, he notes, about the only goal the administration clearly articulated was "setting deadlines for troop withdrawals." This approach, he says, "is a gross misuse of American military power."
<p><b>	4) Whether Congress and the public support the action.</b>
<p>	As the Vietnam experience showed, "only when the nation is solidly behind an intervention can the United States hope to sustain credible military efforts abroad," Hillen cautions. In the absence of such support, the United States is forced into humiliating withdrawals like the Somalia debacle in 1994.
<p><b>	5) Whether the U.S. military can create "the conditions for their success" -- enabling U.S. forces to achieve their objectives.</b>
<p>	"This does not mean saving the U.S. military for just 'the big ones'," Hillen says. "Limited interventions done properly, such as the 1986 F-111 raid on Tripoli, Libya, can have a decisive effect." 
<p>	However, he warns, there is always the temptation in limited military interventions to greatly restrict the operational latitude and resources made available to the military command, "because the purpose of the intervention is to send an indeterminate political signal."
<p>	In any intervention, Hillen says, "the military must be given goals that it understands, that it can reach through methods for which it is well trained, and that will make a difference, once attained."
<p>	"There is always a measure of political and military risk to military intervention," the Heritage Foundation report concludes. "However, by establishing workable criteria for military interventions, the United States can minimize those risks, or, at the very least, ensure that the risks are consistent with the costs of the intervention," Hillen says.

<head><title>1993 Tax Hike Dampening U.S. Economy - Heritage PR</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center><h2>News Release</h2><hr><a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>214 Massachusetts Avenue NE<br>Washington, D.C. 20002<br>(202 546-4400<br><p><hr><h2>1993 TAX HIKE DAMPENING U.S. ECONOMY,
NEW STUDY SHOWS</h2>
</center><P>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<P>

		WASHINGTON, MAY 1, 1996</b> -- Along with the recent news that the U.S. economy grew by only 0.5 percent during the final quarter of last year comes a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1078.html">new study</a> from The Heritage Foundation that helps explain why: the $241 billion tax hike enacted in 1993.
<p>		Employing one of the computer models of the economy used by the federal government and many leading U.S. corporations, Heritage Foundation economists found from 1993 through the end of 1996 the tax increase will cost the economy $208 billion in total output, reduce the number of new jobs by 1.2 million, and cost the typical family approximately $2,600 in higher taxes and lower earnings.
<p>		With economic security shaping up as a key issue in the 1996 elections, these findings shed light on the widely observed economic "anxiety" felt by many Americans, say study authors <a href="/heritage/staff/hodge.htm">Scott Hodge</a>, Grover M. Hermann fellow in federal budgetary affairs, and <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William Beach</a>, visiting fellow in tax analysis.  "People are right to feel they should be better off today than they are," the authors say.  "The 1993 tax increase deprived them of a higher standard of living by cutting the economy's growth."
<p>		Heritage arrived at its findings by essentially "deleting" the tax and spending changes contained in Omnibus Budget and Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA-93) from the computer model -- the Washington University Macro Model (WUMM). This generates a simulation of how the economy would have performed if these factors had not been changed. No other variables were changed, and only mainstream economic assumptions were made where necessary.
<p>		In addition to slower growth and fewer new jobs, the Heritage analysis also indicated that employee wages and salaries will be reduced by $112 billion, automobile and light truck sales will fall short by 1.3 million vehicles, and businesses will invest some $42.5 billion less in durable goods.
<p>		Taking a specific year -- 1995 -- the study found that the economy would have grown by an additional $66 billion in gross domestic product (GDP) were it not for the 1993 tax hike. And for the entire period between 1993 and 1996, the total loss in economic growth is an estimated $208 billion, or $2,100 for every household in America.  
<p>		As for the 1.2 million jobs not created as a result of the 1993 tax and budget changes, nearly 17 percent were the result of new businesses not formed. For every $1 billion in economic growth, roughly 195 new businesses are created.  This means the loss of $208 billion in GDP prevented nearly 40,600 businesses, and 203,000 jobs, from being created. The other 1 million missing jobs are likely the result of existing businesses hiring fewer employees due to the tax increase. Hodge and Beach say that although an otherwise healthy economy has created 8 million new jobs over the past three years, the fact remains that "1.2 million Americans who could have been working today are not because of the 1993 tax increase."
<p>		Not only are fewer Americans working than would have been, but those who are working are earning less.  Of the $112 billion in lower wages and salaries caused by OBRA-93, $46.5 billion will be lost in 1996 alone, according to the Heritage projection using the WUMM model.  That translates into roughly $465 for every household in America, more than the average U.S. household's monthly housing bill of $440.
<p>		Specific industries also are suffering from OBRA-93. In the automobile industry, for example, the loss of 368,000 vehicle sales in 1996 alone means $4.8 billion in lower revenue and 60,100 fewer jobs in auto-related fields.  And as for computers, more than one-third of the $42.5 billion shortfall in durable-goods purchases by businesses will be reflected in lost computer sales, the Heritage study indicates.
<p>		Far from being the healthiest economy in 30 years, as President Clinton has said, "the current economy is lousy compared to past recoveries and lousy compared to what it would have been without the 1993 tax increase," Beach says. "The first rules of economics should be the same as it is in medicine: First, do no harm."

<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> On April 15, the day Americans' increasingly burdensome tax bill is due, The House of Representatives will vote to make it harder to increase taxes in the future.  The <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.J.RES.159:">Tax Limitation Constitutional Amendment</a> would require a two-thirds vote in Congress to raise taxes rather than the fifty percent plus one currently required.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"In 1950, families paid only 5 percent of their income in federal taxes," said Herger.  "In 1990, that number jumped to 24 percent and when combined with state and local taxes, families lose almost half their income to taxes.  If a two-thirds tax increase amendment had been in place since 1980, the American people would have been spared more than $660 billion in new taxes, all of which were used to pay for more government spending."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"Over the past three decades, Washington has paid for wasteful and excessive federal spending by simply raising taxes on working families and small businesses," added Herger.  "These excessive taxes stifle business growth, hurt families, and hinder our nation's economy.  It shouldn't be easy to take money from families and businesses -- it's their money not Washington's."
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"A two-thirds requirement to raise taxes would go a long way toward reining in runaway federal spending and putting a check on excessive taxation," said Herger.  "The requirement would also become a valued component in our efforts to reform the entire tax system."

<h2>DEMOCRACY IN TAIWAN FORCES NEW U.S.-PRC-ROC STRATEGIC BALANCE, ANALYST SAYS</h2>
</center>
<P>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<P>
	WASHINGTON, APRIL 12, 1996</b> -- Taiwan's new democratic status will force the People's Republic of China (PRC) to treat her with much greater caution and respect, and U.S. policy-makers to take America's commitment to her safety more seriously, a Heritage Foundation analyst said today.
<p>	According to <a href="/heritage/staff/yates.html">Stephen J. Yates</a>, a policy analyst with Heritage's <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/asian.htm">Asian Studies Center</a>, the new situation "forces all sides to recalculate their strategies and find a new balance." For the United States, "democracy on Taiwan makes it more difficult to overlook Taiwan's interests while seeking better relations with China." From now on, "U.S. policy-makers will be freer to stand up for Taiwan because they will more clearly occupy the moral high ground," Yates says, "whereas China will have to be more circumspect in its belligerence where Taiwan is concerned." In fact, he says, "Taiwanese democracy strikes at the very heart of the Chinese Communist Party's legitimacy." 
<p>
	"It will be increasingly difficult for Beijing to vilify Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui as an enemy of the Chinese people while posing as brotherly compatriots of the Taiwanese who elected him," Yates says. On a practical level, this means "if the people of Tibet, Xinjiang, or even Beijing decide they want to democratically choose their representative," the answer no longer can be "that Western-style democracy does not work and is inappropriate for the Chinese." In fact, Yates says democracy on Taiwan "challenges Beijing to change in a way that will make Taiwan's future reunification with the mainland compatible with the interests of the people of Taiwan."  
<p>	Meanwhile, "democracy is of great strategic importance to Taiwan -- more important than any weapon system it could acquire," Yates points out. "It makes the ROC much more likely to draw support from the United States and other developed democracies in the event of a hostile threat from mainland China."
<p>	Yates offers a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/bgup272.html">game plan</a> U.S. policy-makers should follow to protect American interests in the Far East, and promote stability in the region. Among the proposals:<p>
<ul>
	<li>  Encourage the resumption of cross-Strait dialogue, so that China and Taiwan have a forum to discuss and resolve issues;<p>
<li> Support Taiwan's bid to join international organizations, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the World Bank, even if the PRC objects;<p>
<li>	  In accordance with the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, continue to sell Taiwan arms of a defensive nature, and assist Taiwan in developing a strategic missile-defense system;<p>
	<li>  Avoid linking renewal of the PRC's most favored nation (MFN) trade status with Taiwan issues, since such linkage would be counterproductive and would probably hurt Taiwan and Hong Kong, which have manufacturing concerns on the mainland; and<p>
<li> Support a cross-Strait armistice agreement, perhaps one whereby Taiwan would pledge not to declare independence for a specific period of time, and Beijing would agree to renounce the use of force during that same period.<p>
</ul>
	"The March 23 election demonstrated the maturity of Taiwan's democracy," Yates observes. "Despite large-scale military and rhetorical intimidation from Beijing, the election ran smoothly.  Now the United States, China and Taiwan must establish a new equilibrium that will be successful in the new strategic environment."

<h2>DESPITE VICTORIES, CONSERVATISM FACES TOUGH FIGHT, HERITAGE PRESIDENT SAYS</h2>
</center><b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>
	WASHINGTON, APRIL 11, 1996</b> -- President Clinton's State of the Union pronouncement that "the era of big government is over" seemed to cement conservatism's position as the dominant political philosophy in America.  
<p>	Not so fast, says the president of The Heritage Foundation in his latest annual essay on "The State of Conservatism," released today. It's true conservatives have scored some important victories, but "the war is far from over," according to <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin J. Feulner</a>, head of the well-known conservative think tank.  
<p>	"Liberalism is not dead," Feulner says, "because it is just too much fun to spend other people's money." He notes that after President Clinton's eulogy for big government, one of his first actions was to demand $8 billion in new spending from Congress for the current fiscal year. 
<p>	What's more, he says, the Washington establishment's response to many of the proposals for conservative change has been a resounding "no": no term limits, no balanced budget, no welfare reform, no entitlement reform, no significant regulatory relief, and no end to the National Endowment for the Arts, Legal Services Corporation and numerous other non-essential programs and agencies.
<p>	While Feulner is not prepared to declare the end of liberalism as a political entity, neither does he agree with those "perpetually melancholy conservatives who subscribe to the headline 'We Lost.'" After all, he says, Congress passed both a bold, seven-year balanced budget plan and real welfare reform (both vetoed by President Clinton). And even in the face of threatened retaliation from the powerful senior-citizen lobby, Congress tried to reform Medicare -- a valiant effort that would have saved the program from impending bankruptcy.
<p>	Of course, Congress also committed its share of blunders in the past year, Feulner says. For example, lawmakers dallied on the passage of the line-item veto. "Without sounding too much like the liberal League of Women Voters or Common Cause," he says, "the line-item veto languished for 18 months because the GOP Congress didn't want to hand this weapon to President Clinton." Calling the veto central to getting control of the budget, Feulner says, "The credibility of all of us who truly believe in smaller, less intrusive government suffered while Congress dragged its feet on this promise." The legislation finally was approved this spring and signed into law on April 9.
<p>	Feulner also criticizes some of his fellow conservatives for their short-sightedness on tax reform. "Reforming the tax code to produce a flat -- or at least a flatter -- tax was to have been the driving issue in the '96 election," Feulner says. Instead, the GOP presidential hopefuls earlier this year used the issue to attack one another.  "What were these Republicans -- self-proclaimed conservatives all -- doing playing upon class warfare and class envy, positions long the domain of the left?" he asks.
<p>	Despite these short-term setbacks, the Heritage Foundation chief executive remains upbeat about the direction in which the country is moving politically. The reason: "Most Americans realize liberalism has been a failure." Citing a <I>Washington Post</I> series bemoaning the fact that many Americans have lost confidence in government, Feulner says, "Of course they have; any sane person would." After all, what other reaction can there be to stories like the one cited by Feulner on how Minnesota's Medicaid program is paying for sex-change operations?  Transsexuals may complain that they are "trapped" in the bodies of the opposite sex, he says, "but what about the average American who is trapped inside the body of a taxpayer?"
<p>	As long as such liberal excesses continue -- and there is no reason to believe they will cease -- Feulner believes the conservative case will remain as strong as ever. "I am optimistic," he says, "because conservative prescriptions are based on sound economic principles and a realistic understanding of human nature, not on wishful thinking." 
<p>	"People genuinely want to get this country back on the right track," he says. "The end result will be a more conservative -- and better -- America."

<title>Heritage Offers Blueprint for Dismantling U.S. Department of Education - Heritage PR</title></head>

<h2>HERITAGE FOUNDATION OFFERS BLUEPRINT FOR DISMANTLING U.S. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION</h2></center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact:  Heritage Public Relations<p>

	WASHINGTON, APRIL 5, 1996</b> -- Congress should take the funds now going to the U.S. Department of Education and send them back back to states, localities and parents, Heritage Foundation analysts said in a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/education/bg1076.html">study</a> released today. 
<p>	To assist lawmakers in this task, the study's authors, Visiting Fellow in Education Denis Doyle and Policy Analyst Christine Olson, have put together a comprehensive plan that would eliminate many federal education programs outright, transfer some programs to other government agencies, and roll others into block grants to be administered by states and localities.
<p>	Doyle and Olson recommend a host of programs for termination, including Goals 2000, President Clinton's education reform initiative, the Bilingual and Immigrant Education program (to be phased out over three years), college Work-Study, and Direct Student Loans. Programs that would be transferred to other government agencies include student financial-aid, such as Pell Grants and Federal Perkins Loans. These would go to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. A host of programs are recommended for either full or partial conversion into state or local block grants, including Supplemental Education Opportunity Grants and Title I, the federal aid program for school districts with high concentrations of poor students.  
<p>	Doyle and Olson say the Back to Basics Education Reform Act, sponsored by Reps. Joe Scarborough, R-Fla., and Steve Chabot, R-Ohio, "is an excellent vehicle to dismantle the department because it would entrust authority over issues of educational policy to the states and the people." The bill would abolish the Department of Education one year after its enactment; roll all elementary and post-secondary education programs into two separate block grants; and eliminate major portions of the federal education bureaucracy. 
<p>	According to Doyle and Olson, "Since its creation in 1979, the Department of Education has done precisely what its severest critics envisioned: It has usurped state and local control of education by slowly imposing a steady stream of bureaucratic, heavy-handed and intrusive rules and requirements and has inserted itself into almost all aspects of the day-to-day workings of the nation's 15,025 school districts."  
<p>	The result, besides taking control away from parents, teachers and local officials, is "practically no positive impact on student performance." In fact, as the federal government's role in education increased, academic performance of the nation's students has declined. Since the Department of Education was created in 1979, Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) scores have stagnated, the high-school dropout rate has risen from 8 percent to 12 percent, and, despite spending more money per pupil on elementary and secondary schools than any other county, math and science test scores of American 13-year-olds still lag behind those of other industrial countries. 
<p>	"Taxpayers should recognize the obvious: The purpose of a federal role in education is to 'federalize' the nation's schools, to make them march to a common drumbeat. And it is succeeding, to the detriment of our children's education," say Doyle and Olson. The federal role in education -- currently subsidized to the tune of more than $31 billion per year -- has expanded from 100 programs in 1980 to more than 240 today.	
<p>	Yet, the federal government does have an important role to play in education, the authors say. "Washington should limit its role to doing things states and localities cannot do themselves and that also serve a larger national purpose," they say. For example, "the federal government has an overriding responsibility to protect the constitutional rights of all Americans, in school or out." In addition, they acknowledge a federal role for "data collection, dissemination, analysis and research, and in helping poor school children get a good education (through creation of school voucher systems, for example). All of these jobs can be handled at the agency level, the analysts say. 
<p>	 "One the other hand," they say, "when it comes to such basic educational matters as management of classroom instruction, adoption of curricula, and text book selection, official Washington is capable of little more than offering advice."
<p>	"It is time to rethink the role of the federal government in education. States and localities are the 'laboratories of democracy'; educational reform should originate at these levels, not be imposed from on high from a bunch of Washington bureaucrats," Doyle and Olson say.

<center><B>Executive Summary</B><P>
</center>

<b><i>Americans are unquestionably a religious people. Studies show that virtually
all of us believe in God or another higher spiritual force; a clear majority regularly
attend religious services.<p>
     
Both news and entertainment television insist they reflect reality, yet they continue 
to tell the public that religion is insignificant and, more likely than not, a negative 
influence in society. <P>

Such is the primary finding of the Media Research Center's third annual study on 
the major television  networks' treatment of religion, which covers all network news
and prime time entertainment programming.  Faith in a Box, the most comprehensive
analysis of television and religion ever done, consists of two separate studies, one
on the news, the other on entertainment television.<p> 
<hr>

<a name="Entertainment"</a>
<center><B>Entertainment Media:<p></center></b>

The number of portrayals of religion in prime time went up slightly, to 287 from 
253 in 1994. However,  given that there were almost 1,800 hours of original shows,
that means there was only fewer than one depiction for every six hours of programming
 -- a slightly better ratio than that of 1994. Most of the increase in portrayals is attributable
to the debut last year of two part-time networks, UPN and WB. CBS's treatments of religion
greatly increased, but this was offset by ABC's sharp drop off.<p>

In two categories -- depictions of the devout laity and of the clergy -- the situation
worsened markedly. In the laity category, positives plummeted from 44 percent in '94
to 11 percent in '95, while negatives shot  from 35 percent in '94 to 64 percent last year.
Only 20 percent of depictions of the clergy were positive in '95, an eight percent drop
from '94.<p>

On no network were even half the overall portrayals positive. CBS had the highest
percentage (47.5) of  positive depictions among the major networks. ABC (36.7) and
NBC (34.4) were well in back of CBS, while Fox (24.4) badly trailed all other networks.<p>
<hr>

<a name="News"</a>
<center><b>News Media:</b></center><p>

Total network news coverage of religion in 1995 remained numerically insignificant:
out of more than 18,000 evening news stories in 1995, religion drew only 249; out of
more than 26,000 morning news segments, religion drew only 224. For three years in
a row, the news networks have had trouble cracking a one-percent barrier when it 
comes to religion coverage.<p>

           
The Catholic Church dominated religion news coverage, attracting almost 50 percent
of the evening stories and 71 percent of the morning segments. CBS aired the most 
obviously negative stories on the Catholic Church, including a 60 Minutes profile with
25 &quot;dissidents&quot; and no defenders, and a story calling Ireland a &quot;
church-dominated backwater.&quot;<p>

While the total number of stories about violence and harassment at abortion clinics
declined from 245 stories in 1994 to 142, only three stories focused on the documented
violence of abortionor harassment by abortion advocates.<p>

The religious right was again portrayed as extreme and damaging to the Republican Party,
even though not a single pro-life incumbent lost in the 1994 elections.  <p>

In the first two studies, the MRC suggested a number of ways the networks could improve
their coverageof religion. With a few notable exceptions, none has been enacted. Given the
public's increasing dissatisfaction with and distrust of the media, it is instructive to repeat
these recommendations and urge network decision makers to change their course.<p> 

Network entertainment divisions should cease their hostility to persons of faith and 
respect religious values. Furthermore, they should attempt to match CBS's success 
with Touched By an Angel by airing other pro-faith series of their own. Also, they 
ought to recognize that the audience for such religion-friendly programming is not
only large, but affluent (i.e., it's an attractive demographic for advertisers).<p>

The news study recommends that the networks decisively break the one-percent
ghetto of coverage that religion receives every year. To make that recommendation
reality, the networks need to make a serious commitment to hire a religion correspondent.
With the exception of ABC, the networks have failed to go beyond general assignment 
reporters. The news study also recommends that network reporters try harder to present
religious issues and authorities in a fair-minded and objective manner, especially on social
issues. <p></b></i>

<h3>I. INTRODUCTION</h3> 
  
<b><i>The Media Research Center's initial &quot;Faith in a Box&quot; study
explored how entertainment television handled religion in 1993.
The report showed that on the rare occasions when sitcoms,
dramas, miniseries, and made-for-TV movies treated spiritual
topics, it was most often in a hostile manner; there were even
some cases of bluntly anti-religious bigotry. <p>

The mixed results documented in our second study, which dealt
with 1994 programming, suggested that a rethinking and
reawakening might have been taking place in Hollywood. Whereas in
1993 negative depictions had outnumbered positive ones by a
3-to-2 ratio, in '94 there were almost twice as many positive as
negative portrayals. Furthermore, the total number of religious
incidences more than doubled: there were 253 in '94, versus only
116 in '93. <p>

The minuses: the laity and the clergy continued to be vilified in
dramas, ridiculed in comedies. Moreover, the frequency of
religious depictions -- roughly, one for every seven hours of
programming -- illuminated the fact that religion remained
largely a non-presence in prime time. <p>
 
This third annual study, covering 1995 programming, indicates in
one sense that the '94 results were not aberrant: overall, there
again were more positive than negative portrayals. However, in
two categories -- depictions of the devout laity and of the
clergy -- the picture worsened markedly. And, not only did the
total number of treatments increase only slightly, most of the
jump was attributable to the 1995 launch of two part-time
networks, UPN and WB.<p>

Television bigwigs like to claim their fare reflects reality.
This is clearly not the case with religion; given its prevalence
and popularity in our society, it is 1) seriously
underrepresented and 2) ill-served on prime time. The viewing
public is waiting for the networks to close, or at least narrow,
this gap. <p>

Our methodology: MRC analysts studied virtually all 1995 prime
time entertainment programs on the broadcast networks ABC, CBS,
Fox, NBC, UPN, and WB. Instances of religious content were
entered into a computerized data base and categorized under
either personal faith; religion in doctrinal and institutional
terms; the laity; the clergy; or miscellaneous. <p>

Within each category, the instances were classified as either
positive, mixed, neutral, or negative. &quot;Mixed&quot; indicates balanced
points of view with ultimately no side taken; the &quot;neutral&quot;
designation encompasses depictions that were ambiguous or offered
insufficiently substantial treatments of the issue. (In our
previous studies, mixed/neutral was one category.)<p>


The outstanding portrayals in each category are presented below
in order of their length, with the briefest instances discussed
first. Not all treatments or mentions of religion are touched on
in the text, but each is represented in the statistical
appendices, and each is noted by category, chronologically, in a
third appendix.<p> 
<hr>

<a name="Two"></a>
<h3>II. STUDY RESULTS</h3>

<i>Overview?</i><p>

In 1995, there were 1,798 hours of original prime time
entertainment programming on the six broadcast networks. Those
webs aired 287 portrayals of religion; 38.3 percent of these were
positive, 27.9 negative, 7.3 mixed, and 26.5 neutral. <p>

Where raw numbers are concerned, CBS led with 99 depictions; NBC
broadcast 93, Fox 45, ABC 30. (UPN, with 12, and WB, with eight,
both of which went on the air early in 1995, each offered
programming only two nights per week that year.) NBC
and Fox held relatively steady from last year to this, but CBS's
number represented an large increase over 1994's total of 63,
while ABC plummeted from its 1994 figure of 67.  <p>

CBS had the highest percentage of positive depictions, at 47.5;
ABC (36.7 percent) and NBC (34.4) followed, and Fox, with 24.4,
brought up the rear among the major networks. Fox led in negative
portrayals at 46.7 percent; ABC (36.7), NBC (26.9), and CBS
(20.2) trailed. <p>

In religious terms, Touched By an Angel, the CBS drama currently
in its second season, was the outstanding series of 1995, and
perhaps the most pro-faith series in television history. (After a
shaky start, it is also a bona fide popular success.) No series
was anywhere near as anti-religious, although Fox's The Simpsons
consistently got in its licks. Probably the greatest
disappointment of the year was NBC's Amazing Grace, whose
minister protagonist espoused a faith so diluted as to be almost
unrecognizable.<p>
<pre>
   <h3>A. Faith: Prime Time's Expressions of Belief<p></h3>

  As in 1993 and '94, religion was treated far more favorably in
  this category than in any other. It comprises instances wherein a
  person states or manifests in simple terms his or her belief, or
  lack thereof.

  Positive -- 76.6 percent (74% in 1994; 63% in 1993)<p>

  On prime time, the most common indication of faith is prayer. In
  the March 13 NBC movie Awake to Danger, a father whose daughter
  is in a coma offers to help; the doctor tells him to pray. On the
  February 21 Grace Under Fire (ABC), a man remarks that he &quot;prayed
  that the Lord would give me one more chance to make [his
  seriously ill father] proud of me.&quot;<p>


  A character on the September 25 Chicago Hope (CBS) says, &quot;I
  hadn't been to church in years. That is, not until recently, when
  my daughter had heart trouble and I found myself praying.&quot;
  Another medical drama, NBC's ER, featured on its December
  14 episode an elderly Holocaust survivor whose kidnapped
  granddaughter had just been found alive. The old woman comments
  that while the little girl was missing, &quot;I did something that I
  stopped doing fifty years ago: I prayed.&quot;<p>
   
  On the September 30 Sisters (NBC), Teddy, who is coming out of a
  coma, takes part in a fantastical exchange with her younger self.
  After the young Teddy says, &quot;All it takes is a little
  persistence,&quot; the adult Teddy adds, &quot;;And a whole lot of faith.&quot;
  The camera then pans upward to the sky. <P>
   
  One of the celestial emissaries on CBS's Touched By an Angel had
  her own crisis of faith in the February 25 episode. Monica,
  addressing God, wonders, &quot;Why have You forsaken me? Why are You
  punishing me?&quot; Monica's mentor, Tess, responds, &quot;Has God ever
  forsaken you, Monica? He told you he wouldn't, and He never has.&quot;<p>
   
  Fox's The X-Files surprised many with an affirmation of
  Catholicism in its December 15 installment. Scully, an FBI agent,
  regains her faith while investigating a series of murders in
  which each victim has what appears to be stigmata. After the case
  is solved, Scully goes to confession and discusses her drift from
  the Church in the past few years; the priest tells her,
  &quot;Sometimes you have to go full circle.&quot; Scully has the
  show's last line: &quot;God is speaking, but no one's listening.&quot;<p>

  The January 10 episode of NBC's The John Larroquette Show
  centered on what many perceived as an image of Jesus Christ on a
  bus-station wall. Even though it transpires that the face is
  really that of Willie Nelson from an old, painted-over poster,
  the image inspires a good deal of pro-faith reflection. The bus
  station manager, addressing God, states, &quot;I have spent most of my
  life unconvinced of Your existence, [but] I have come to believe
  in a higher power.&quot;<p>


  Negative -- 6.4 percent (6% in 1994; 22% in 1993)<p>

  On the May 9 NYPD Blue (ABC), Detective Sipowicz explains to his
  fiancee that he lost his faith as a result of the depravity he's
  witnessed on the job, and on the December 1 Homicide: Life on the
  Street (NBC), a Baltimore detective, offered the chance to see
  the Pope in person during the pontiff's visit to that city,
  comments, &quot;Sixty thousand people...looking at a man for some sort
  of miracle? No, thank you. I'm not interested.&quot;<p>

  Mixed --  8.5 percent; Neutral -- 8.5 percent; (Mixed/neutral 20%
  in 1994; 15% in 1993)<p>

  One mixed incidence was found on the February 26 Earth 2 (NBC).
  After Yale prays, Mary, a resident of the Tarian planet, asks,
  &quot;Who were you talking to?&quot; Yale responds, &quot;God...[to] ask
  forgiveness for the harm that [one does].&quot; Mary counters,
  &quot;The Tarian way is better: Don't harm.&quot; A neutral example:
  apropos of a murder, a policeman on the March 19 NBC movie Ed
  McBain's 87th Precinct asks, &quot;If there's a God in heaven, why do
  things like this have to happen?&quot; His partner answers, &quot;I don't
  know.&quot;<p> 


   <h3>B. The Institution: Prime Time's Treatment of Churches and Their
     Doctrines</h3>

  This category deals with religion handled in institutional terms,
  such as a reference to a service or to a particular church or its
  doctrines.

  Positive -- 31.1 percent (46% in 1994; 50% in 1993)
  On the January 17 Something Wilder (NBC), a boy, age five or so,
  asks his father where one goes after death. His father replies,
  &quot;Heaven.&quot; A character on the November 26 episode of Fox's Space:
  Above and Beyond comments, "When I'm on a battlefield, and I see
  a human dead...I can feel something is missing...You can feel
  they have no souls." 
 
  During the December 12 CBS movie A Holiday to Remember, a woman
  tells a young runaway, "Come on, I don't want to be visiting you
  down at the jail in five years. You need religion." On the
  December 18 Can't Hurry Love (CBS), Annie tries to organize her
  co-workers to volunteer with religious charities, performing such
  tasks as collecting Christmas gifts for needy children.<p>
 
  Negative -- 31.1 percent (22% in 1994; 50% in 1993)<p>

  The title character of CBS's Murphy Brown is hosting a memorial
  service in the January 16 installment; asked if she's put a Bible
  out for the mourners, Murphy answers, &quot;Eeeuuuwww, I don't think I
  have one.&quot; On the November 2 episode of Fox's The Crew, a woman
  says to a gay character, &quot;I don't care what they say about you in
  Leviticus. I think you are fun.&quot;<p>
   
  In the March 8 premiere of CBS's The George Wendt Show, two
  characters return to their old church for casino night; one says
  the visit brings back memories of "the gradual stripping away of
  a young boy's self-esteem.&quot; On the November 21 episode of ABC's
  Roseanne, the protagonist, playing an unpleasant pilgrim at the
  first Thanksgiving, dismisses an Indian's reference to "Mother
  Earth.&quot;<p>

  &quot;That's nothing but heathen talk,&quot; Roseanne remarks. "There is
  one God. He's in  heaven, sitting on [His] throne, so he can damn
  everything. The end.&quot;<p>
  
  
  Mixed -- 6.6 percent; Neutral -- 31.1 percent; (Mixed/neutral 32%
  in 1994; 0% in 1993)
   
  A mixed example comes from the May 9 Wings (NBC). After a
  character remarks that he's going to attend Mass regularly, a
  friend commends him: "Good for you...Without a strong spiritual
  connection, what does life really mean?" He asks what religion
  she is, to which she replies dismissively, "I don't know. Some
  sort of Protestant."
  
  In the neutral category, a character on the June 14 High Sierra
  Search and Rescue (NBC) who's been a recluse since her husband
  left her is rebuked by a friend: "You quit your job because you
  couldn't make it ten miles to work. Then five miles to church."
  On the March 14 John Larroquette Show, a regular character rigs
  it so John can see another player's poker hand. Afterwards, the
  character says, "What if God really does keep score of all the
  bad things you do? I'd hate to think I had only one sin left and
  wasted it riggin' a poker game when I could've robbed a bank or
  something."  


   <h3>C. The Laity: Prime Time's Portrayal of Believers</h3>

  This category encompasses depictions of those for whom religion
  is a strong (sometimes the central) force in their lives. It
  covers both portrayals of their explicitly religious words or
  deeds and their secular conduct. As opposed to simple
  declarations of faith, we see here and in the clergy category
  that the more elaborate the depiction, the more likely it is to
  be negative -- a finding common to all three studies.   


  Positive -- 11.1 percent (44% in 1994; 18% in 1993)
   
  In the March 20 NBC movie Menu For Murder, a mistress asserts her
  affair with a judge would not have lasted because the judge's
  wife is a devout Catholic. On the October 31 The Client (CBS), a
  woman tells a friend that the friend's taking in her grandchild
  was &quot;a Christian thing.&quot;<p>
  
  Negative -- 64.4 percent (35% in 1994; 68% in 1993)
   
  Murphy Brown's title character, addressing a women's studies
  class during the October 30 episode, asserts, "While we sit here
  arguing, the radical religious right is working to take away
  everything we've fought for." During the May 14 CBS movie
  The Rockford Files: A Blessing in Disguise, an actress appearing
  in an irreverent movie is called a "slut" and almost physically
  assaulted by followers of a televangelist.  
   
  Detectives on the February 24 Homicide: Life on the Street drop
  by the house of a middle-aged woman prominently displaying a
  crucifix on her front door. She admits she killed her boyfriend
  (for dating her sister) and put his body in the freezer. On the
  November 29 Law & Order, a mentally disturbed woman kills her
  baby daughter because she believes God wanted her to.
  
  Mixed -- 4.4 percent; Neutral -- 20.0 percent; (Mixed/neutral 21%
  in 1994; 14% in 1993)
   
  One of the mixed treatments was offered by the April 28 Picket
  Fences (CBS). After killing a swan, a repentant young boy becomes
  devoutly religious and develops what appear to be stigmata. His
  sister accepts what happens to him at face value, but the
  patriarch says any supernatural explanation is "crap" and
  "evidence of how dangerous and how ridiculous organized religion
  can be."
   
  Neutral examples: on the January 10 Frasier (NBC), an adult son
  says to his father, "Brush your teeth and say your prayers." The
  father responds, "That's what I used to say...didn't I?" His
  other son says, "No, you didn't," to which the father replies, "I
  meant to." Establishing his credentials as a good citizen, a
  murder suspect on the November 22 Law & Order (NBC) says, "I pay
  my taxes. I go to church." He turns out to be innocent. 
  

   <h3>D. The Clergy: Prime Time's Treatment of Religious Leaders</h3>
   
  This category comprises portrayals of the professionally
  religious.
  
  Positive -- 20.0 percent (28% in 1994; 15% in 1993)
   
  On the November 27 Nowhere Man (UPN), a mother gives her son news
  of his hometown: Father Kearney has died. "He was a wonderful
  man," she says. "Everyone in town will miss him dearly." In the
  February 5 CBS movie The Piano Lesson, a minister says, "I ain't
  got no power...God's got the power...God's got a wonderful
  power." A priest on the November 12 NBC movie Her Hidden Truth
  champions the cause of a woman unjustly convicted of murder.
  
  Negative -- 41.7 percent (31% in 1994; 59% in 1993)
   
  On the January 1 George Carlin Show (Fox), a waitress in a bar
  shows her breasts to a priest. He says he finds them attractive,
  whereupon she says to her boyfriend, "If an abnormal man like him
  likes them, they're good enough for you." On the March 25
  Mommies (NBC), a woman laments, "I've turned into a boring person
  who makes rules and says no," to which her friend queries,
  "You're the Pope?" A married minister asks Ellen for a date on
  the November 5 Cleghorne! (WB).
   
  During the March 8 George Wendt Show, a man reminisces about a
  nun lifting him by his eyebrows and about "all the hell [priests
  and nuns] put me through as a kid." In the April 17 NBC movie The
  Other Mother, a teen mother lives at a Catholic halfway house;
  the nuns who run the home are portrayed not just as well-meaning
  disciplinarians, but as excessively harsh. 
 

  Mixed -- 5.0 percent, Neutral -- 33.3 percent (Mixed/neutral 41%
  in 1994; 26% in 1993)<p>
 
  The December 8 Picket Fences provided the outstanding mixed
  instance. The episode centered on a visit by Pope John Paul II to
  a small Wisconsin town, where he witnesses a murder. The attorney
  for the accused killer declares that because the victim was gay,
  the Pope can't be an unbiased witness given the Vatican's
  condemnation of homosexual acts. Others, including the judge in
  the case, are more respectful of the pontiff.<p>
   
  Among the neutrals: On the October 1 Hope & Gloria (NBC),
  regarding a nun named Theodore Rose, a man wonders, &quot;Why do nuns
  always have names that make them sound like they're half man,
  half woman?&quot; His ex-wife answers, &quot;What difference does it make?
  They don't use either half.&quot; On the October 8 Can't Hurry Love, a
  woman says, &quot;I'm sure even Mother Teresa has things she doesn't
  like about guys. OK, so maybe her dating years are behind her,
  but you get my point.&quot; <p>
  

   <h3>E. Miscellaneous</h3>

  In other words, everything that didn't fit into the other
  categories. Many references to God go here if they don't belong
  under Faith, inasmuch as He is not, strictly speaking, clergy.<p>
   
  As usual, almost all incidences were mixed or neutral. On the
  September 17 Cybill (CBS), a woman who's just been on a shopping
  spree says, &quot;I, for one, feel closer to God.&quot; One of the positive
  examples was heard on the May 5 Homicide: Life on the Street.
  When a detective was told he was lucky not to have been shot, he
  replies, &quot;Luck had nothing to do with it. God reached down and
  graced [the potential killer] with wisdom.&quot;

<h3>III. RECOMMENDATIONS</center></h3> <br>
   
In last year's study, we noted a marginal improvement in prime
time's treatment of religion from 1993 to `94, yet in
quantitative terms the numbers were still anemic and in
qualitative terms the attacks on religion continued.<P>
  
Regarding 1995, the overall numbers were similar to those of `94.
There was, however, significant qualitative regression in certain
categories. <p>
   
Perhaps this was, in part, liberal Hollywood's reaction to the
widely acknowledged boost that evangelical voters gave
conservative Republican candidates in the fall '94 elections.
Perhaps old habits don't change easily.<p> 
   
Whatever the motivation, the step backward is cause for concern.
The silver lining, though, is that the failure of the broadcast
networks' yuppie-centered fall offerings and the continued
decline in their share of the audience makes a return to
traditional programming a more attractive prospect now. Our
recommendations:<p>
     
Re-establish respect for religious values on the networks.
Religion should not be treated as if it were a political issue,
where a balance of positive and negative is considered
appropriate. Rather, faith in general, and the faithful in
particular, should be afforded the dignity it and they deserve.
It is highly unlikely that any major network will ever air vast
amounts of faith-oriented programming, nor do we suggest such a
thing should be done. The networks can, however, make it clear to
religious viewers that at the very least, their shows will not
assault Judeo-Christian values. <p>

Clone a religious hit. After the young-adult-oriented Friends
became a smash in the 1994-'95 season, the fall '95 prime time
schedule was thick with series in that genre. With the success of
Touched By an Angel, the networks now have a pro-faith winner to
copy. Wouldn't it be nice to see more shows that dared to speak
of the power of God's love? At the recent Academy Awards, actor
Christopher Reeve challenged the film industry to &quot;put social
issues ahead of box-office success...[to] continue to take risks.
Let's tackle the issues. In many ways, our film community can do
it better than anyone else.&quot; The same challenge applies to
television and matters of faith.<p> 
   
Listen to the concerns of the faithful. Networks invest vast sums
in market research, yet seemingly don't take into account the
millions who, save for series like Touched By an Angel and
Christy, are offended by the values of television and are tuning
out. The more shows of that kind there are, the more that
audience will watch. And make no mistake about it: studies show
this audience is large and affluent. Executives like ABC's Ted
Harbert know that the industry's frantic pursuit of the 18-to-49
demographic was excessive; they should now turn their attention
to the audience that cherish traditional values. In this way,
networks can boost both their Nielsen ratings and their profits.<p>
   
Television is on the hot seat, and the only way to get off it is
to behave responsibly. Ultimately, this means not content
ratings, or encoding for the V-chip, but rather changing the
values promoted over the airwaves. An increase in
religion-friendly programming can and should be at the center of
such a prime time reformation.<p>

<h2>I. INTRODUCTION</h2> 
  
<b><i>The media continue to miss the story of a religious and moral
resurgence across the country in our politics, in our culture,
and most importantly, in our churches. In their survey The
Churching of America, Roger Finke and Rodney Stark reported that
virtually all Americans believe in God or a universal spirit. A
substantial majority believe they will be called before God on
Judgment Day to account for their sins. The vast majority of
Americans believe the Bible is either the literal or inspired
Word of God, and the Ten Commandments are valid rules for living.
Sixty percent of the populace can be found attending houses of
worship in a given month. This &quot;silent majority&quot; still worships
and reflects on their faith under the radar screen of a
secularized media elite.<p>

Despite officially proclaimed concern in the highest councils of
the national news media that religion and religious issues too
often go ignored, the record demonstrates that the concern has
been matched by little noticeable action. The Media Research
Center's first study of television news coverage of religion and
religious values in 1993 discovered both a surprising paucity of
religion coverage and an overt pattern of advocacy against
traditional values: out of more than 18,000 evening news stories,
only 212 evening news stories dealt with religion. Out of more
than 26,000 morning segments, only 197 dealt directly with
religion. Prime-time magazine programs and Sunday morning
interview shows broached religious subjects on only 18 occasions.
The networks had trouble cracking the one percent barrier with
religion coverage. <p>

Employing the same methodology, the Media Research Center
discovered that religious coverage actually declined in 1994.
Evening news stories rose slightly to 225, but morning segments
declined to 151, and Sunday talk show and magazine show segments
dropped to nine. Thanks in part to events like the papal visit to
the United States in October, 1995's network output on religious
news and issues added up to a slight increase over 1994. The
number of evening news stories rose to 249; morning segments grew
noticeably to 224; and magazine and interview show segments
increased to 15. Despite the slight increase overall, the
networks are still barely cracking the one percent barrier. The
pattern in unchanging: the networks continue to neglect people
and issues of faith in their everyday reporting. When religion is
covered, hostility toward traditional religious positions on
social issues remains overt and sometimes unrebutted.  <p>
   
<hr>
<a name="Two"</a>
<h2>II. QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF NETWORK NEWS COVERAGE </h2>
<pre>
  <h3>A. Evening News Stories</h3>

  Out of an estimated 18,000 segments last year on the five network
  programs evaluated (ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News,
  CNN's World News, NBC Nightly News, and The MacNeil-Lehrer
  NewsHour on PBS) the networks devoted only 249 stories to
  religion or religious issues in 1995, a slight increase (11
  percent) from 1994.<p>

  Only 143 of these were reporter-based stories (compared to 106
  anchor briefs), an increase of nine stories from the previous
  year's full story total. <p>

  As in past years, news stories perhaps tangentially related to
  religious issues (in this year's case, the Million Man March led
  by Rev. Louis Farrakhan) were only included if they involved
  issues of religion or theology.<p>

  CNN's World News tied with ABC for the highest number of religion
  stories with 65, even though ABC's World News Tonight lasts only
  half as long. The quantity of news coverage is also determined by
  the length of each story: only 23 (35 percent) of ABC's stories
  were anchor briefs, compared to 47 segments (or 72 percent) of
  CNN coverage. CNN's total was three stories less than 1994, while
  ABC reported 15 stories more than the year before. <p>

  CBS improved to 50 stories, up from 31 stories in 1993 and 46 in
  1994. NBC trailed with 43, the same number as 1994 and 11 less
  than 1993. For the third straight year, The MacNeil-Lehrer
  NewsHour lagged far behind the others with 26 stories, eight more
  than 1994.<p>

  But only 11 were reporter-based stories or interview segments.   
  The Catholic Church again led the coverage with 111 stories, up
  from 103 in 1994. Fully 68 percent of the total (76 stories) were
  anchor briefs, not full-length, reporter-based stories. Generic
  religion stories (without specific reference to denominations),
  often on subjects like school prayer or church-state relations,
  came in second with 70 stories. Once again, news of individual
  Protestant denominations was nearly absent -- five for the
  Southern Baptists, four on Episcopalians, two on Anglicans.
  Muslims drew nine stories; Jews six; Mormons six; Buddhists five;
  Hindus, Greek Orthodox, and Russian Orthodox, one each. Unlike
  1994, when it outnumbered all stories on individual Protestant
  denominations combined, New Age spirituality attracted only one
  evening news story in 1995.<p>
 

  <h3>B. Morning Shows<p></h3>

  Despite a full two hours daily for news and interviews, adding up
  to more than 26,000 segments in 1995, the major network morning
  shows (ABC's Good Morning America, CBS This Morning, and NBC's
  Today) devoted 224 morning show stories to religion in 1994.
  That's not very impressive in terms of the tens of thousands of
  morning segments, but it is a noticeable one-third increase over
  1994, if not a significant increase from the 197 morning news
  stories in 1993.<p>

  Like 1994, the networks were closely matched in their amount of
  coverage. NBC led again with 80 segments, up from 52 in 1994; CBS
  aired 74, up from 48 in 1994; and ABC aired 70, up from 50
  segments in the previous year. Of the 224 stories, more than half (115
  stories) were anchor briefs.<p>

  Greater emphasis on religion interview segments may be partially
  responsible for the increase. NBC interviewed &quot; dissident
  Catholic&quot;  priest and author Andrew Greeley on five occasions. CBS
  devoted an hour of This Morning to a rabbi, a priest, and a
  Protestant pastor. ABC began airing the "God Squad" duo of Father
  Thomas Hartman and Rabbi Marc Gellman in mid-year, relying on
  them for 12 of their 23 interviews in 1995. Gellman's appearances
  substantially heightened the visibility of Jewish voices on the
  networks from past years. Counting Father Hartman's appearances,
  159 stories (71 percent) of the morning coverage featured the
  Catholic Church, a great increase from 63 stories in 1994, a year
  which lacked a papal visit.  <p>


  <h3>C. Magazine/Interview Shows</h3>

  The blind spot to religious news remains especially noticeable on
  Sunday morning interview shows and prime-time magazine programs.
  Analysts reviewed the Sunday shows (ABC's This Week with David
  Brinkley, CBS's Face the Nation, NBC's Meet the Press) as well as
  the prime-time magazine lineup (ABC's Day One, Prime Time Live,
  and 20/20; CBS's Eye to Eye with Connie Chung, 48 Hours, and 60
  Minutes; and NBC's three-night Dateline format). Out of roughly
  400 shows, the number of religion stories rose from nine in 1994
  to 15 in 1995, including segment repeats. But that also includes
  three one-hour programs on religion: a March 15 Peter Jennings
  Reporting special, a September 8 CBS Reports on the religious
  right, and an October 5 48 Hours focusing on the papal visit. Out
  of roughly 150 shows between the three networks, only one Sunday
  morning interview focused on religion: a May 21 segment of Meet
  the Press with Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition and Clinton
  aide George Stephanopoulos. <p>
  </pre>

<h2>III. QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF RELIGION COVERAGE AND SOCIAL ISSUES</h2>
<pre>
 <h3> A. Institutions</h3>

  Institutional coverage of religion again focused mainly on the
  Catholic Church, and reporters focused on the unpopularity of
  Church teachings among the American laity: 15 stories highlighted
  poll results finding a majority of American Catholics rejecting
  Church stands. These polls continued to ignore the statistical
  significance on the issues between Catholics who attend church
  weekly and lapsed Catholics who seldom or never attend Mass.
  The networks again portrayed the traditional Church as an
  oppressive, narrow-minded hierarchy with outdated moral concepts.
  Again, in stories and interviews, moral equivalence was awarded
  to self-proclaimed &quot; dissidents&quot;  with a pro-abortion, pro-gay,
  feminist agenda. A case study is the January 22, 1995 60 Minutes.
  Mike Wallace devoted an entire segment to Call to Action, a
  Chicago-based group of &quot; dissidents.&quot;  Wallace portrayed this group
  as a credible, moderate voice for respectable Catholics: &quot; Among
  the things they challenge is the Pope's position on birth
  control, on women becoming priests, and on priests being able to
  marry....There's no denying that for many American Catholics,
  those teachings have lost their appeal.&quot; <p>

  Wallace characterized his subjects as &quot; hardly wild-eyed radicals,
  these people from Call to Action. They're sober church workers,
  nuns and priests, and just plain concerned Catholics....their
  ideals formed in the heady age of change back in the '60s.&quot;  These
  people had decidedly un-sober things to say. Father Mike Flager
  denounced the Church as &quot; spiritually bankrupt&quot;  and said the
  traditional Church has &quot; a love it or leave it, you know, it's
  that crazy patriotism philosophy.&quot;  Edwina Gately &quot; was described
  as a devout Catholic with the tongue of a pagan tart.&quot;  Gately
  replied: &quot; Well I'm OK with the `pagan tart,' it's the `devout
  Catholic' that worries me.&quot;  Wallace reminded her she once said
  &quot; the Vatican is the only tyranny left in the world today.&quot;  <p>

  Wallace's report included 25 soundbites from &quot; dissidents&quot;  without
  broadcasting a single voice in favor of traditional Catholicism.
  Wallace later conceded to the Catholic newspaper Our Sunday
  Visitor that &quot; interviews with Harvard law professor Mary Ann
  Glendon and George Weigel of the Ethics and Public Policy Center,
  prominent lay Catholics who support Church teaching, were not
  used because producers felt the material was too dissimilar to
  work with footage from the Call to Action conference.&quot;  
  When Pope John Paul visited America in October, he underlined the
  Church's historical call to assist the poor, but network analysts
  gave it a secular spin, portraying the remarks as an attack on
  the Republican Party. PBS anchor Robert MacNeil wondered: &quot; Is the
  Pope against the Contract with America?&quot;  CNN anchor Judy Woodruff
  asked Pat Buchanan about the pontiff: &quot; He's certainly been a
  conservative on many theological issues, but many people would
  agree he's been more liberal on social issues, helping the poor,
  he's talked a lot about this. How do you as a Catholic reconcile
  that with what your own party has done this year and is talking
  of doing with regard to cutting back programs for the poor in
  this country?&quot; <p>

  For three morning interviews, NBC brought on Father Andrew
  Greeley to echo that liberal spin: &quot; I heard a Catholic
  conservative last night say that the Pope's words have nothing to
  do with American politics. And I can't imagine anybody being more
  totally wrong. The Pope has come to the United States when it's
  in a very mean-spirited period when it's bashing immigrants,
  bashing poor people, bashing minorities. And the Pope has come to
  say `Hey, stop that!' He isn't talking about specific legislative
  measures, but he's certainly addressing himself to the spirit
  that elected and sustains the Gingrich-Dole Congress.&quot; 
  But later in the same interview, Greeley suggested Catholics can
  ignore the Pope on sexual matters because Greeley thinks he's
  wrong: &quot; Well, most Catholics choose to be Catholic on their own
  terms....they reserve the right to follow their own consciences
  and appeal to a God who does understand.&quot; <p>

  When Ireland moved to lift its ban on divorce, CBS Evening News
  reporter Cinny Kennard applauded on November 18: &quot; Those opposed
  are backed by the mighty Roman Catholic Church that argues
  divorce would profoundly damage the stability and fabric of Irish
  society...Fear is the primary weapon for those who want to
  maintain the ban.&quot;  Kennard highlighted what she felt were more
  enlightened opinions: &quot; For many here, it's more then a referendum
  on the right to remarry. It's another example of the country's
  move to re-invent itself as a more modern and progressive
  Ireland, an Ireland that is more tolerant and open. Recently,
  there has been legal reform on contraception, abortion, and
  homosexuality; signs that the traditional Church grip on Ireland
  has been loosened; signs that the country is increasingly run
  from government buildings and not the Vatican.&quot; <p> 

  Kennard repeated her line on the November 30 CBS This Morning:
  &quot; It's been like an awakening. Ireland, long positioned on the
  world's stage as a church-dominated backwater, has reinvented
  itself as a new and energized Emerald Isle. A more open, a more
  tolerant place.&quot; <p>

  <h3>B. Abortion and Violence (142 in 1995; 247 in 1994; 150  in 1993)<p></h3>

  Social issues bring out the bias in reporters. In a March 2, 1996
  appearance on the CNBC program Cal Thomas, Washington Post
  reporter Howard Kurtz denied that reporters had a liberal
  political bias in favor of the Democrats, but he did suggest &quot; I
  think there is, however, a problem with what I call cultural bias
  on these subjects that you mentioned -- religion, abortion,
  homosexuality. I think a lot of it is unconscious, but I think on
  those kinds of subjects, most reporters are probably to the left
  of the American public and probably don't realize that they're
  not always giving a full weights of views of people who have very
  different take on these matters.<p>

  Reporters may pride themselves on adding context and perspective
  to the issues, but on abortion the networks continue a troubling
  pattern of black/white distinctions: pro-lifers are inextricably
  linked to a violent, radical fringe, while abortion advocates are
  harassed do-gooders operating in the peaceful mainstream. 
  Due to the lack of further violence against abortionists, evening
  newscasts devoted 59 segments to harassment and violence around
  abortion clinics, down almost 60 percent over the 146 segments
  broadcast in 1994. The network morning shows had 82 segments,
  down almost 14 percent from the 95 segments shown in 1994. Magazine
  shows aired only one segment on abortion-related violence in
  1995, down from the six they presented the previous year. Total
  coverage of violence around abortion clinics on all shows amounted to 142
  stories, compared to the 247 in 1994 and 150 segments in 1993. 
  Among the abortion stories not focusing on pro-life violence, the
  networks reported on the debates in Congress over partial birth
  abortions and abortion services at armed forces hospitals, as
  well as the Surgeon General nomination of Dr. Henry Foster, who had
  trouble remembering how many abortions he had performed. Evening
  shows aired 161 total abortion-related segments, morning shows
  245, and magazine shows 11, for a grand sum of 417 segments. On every
  network, pro-life violence stories garnered about one-third of
  the total coverage. That declined from 1994, when pro-life violence
  stories outnumbered other abortion stories by a 2 to 1 margin. 
  Unlike the past two years, religion was not indicted as a
  co-conspirator in pro-life violence. The media did not allude to
  a &quot; link between crime and religion,&quot;  as CBS Evening News anchor Bob
  Schieffer declared two days after Dr. David Gunn was murdered in
  1993. But, once again, the pro-life movement was demonized as a
  dangerous, menacing force.<p>
 
  On January 3, 1995 Jane Pauley promoted an upcoming segment on
  Dateline NBC by charging: "Still ahead -- the latest round of
  bloodshed and violence at abortion clinics. The anti-abortion
  movement has been creeping to the edge of bloody fanaticism for a
  decade. One hundred twenty-nine bombings across the country. And
  while the national debate rages on there have been 600 acts of
  vandalism, firebombings, sniper attacks, windows shattered. There
  is no way to measure the fear or count the death threats.&quot; 
  All this one-sided coverage has an effect on the public's
  perception of the pro-life movement. Reporter David Culhane
  conveyed the results of a CBS poll on this topic during the
  January 8 CBS Evening News: &quot; A new CBS poll shows that three out
  of four Americans say the protest tactics of some anti-abortion
  activists can be blamed for leading to the recent shootings at
  several abortion clinics.&quot; <p> 

  What about violence perpetrated by abortion advocates? In 1994, 
  only CNN reported (in passing) that Ernest Robertson Jr. tried to
  shoot a pro-life protester after picking up his wife outside a
  Baton Rouge, Louisiana abortion clinic. He shot once and missed,
  and then his gun jammed. He was later charged with attempted
  second-degree murder. But in 1995, the networks again
  demonstrated their pro-abortion bias by failing to report on
  harassment or threats of violence against pro-lifers, despite
  some important stories all the networks missed. <p>

  For example, Daniel Adam Mahoney was the first pro-abortion
  activist indicted under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances
  Act on April 11, 1995. Mahoney called a crisis pregnancy center,
  First Way of Wenatchee, Washington, on January 2 and threatened
  to kill the workers at the center. He also called the National
  Life Center hotline in New Jersey and told an operator he was
  going to shoot pro-life protesters outside abortion clinics. He
  pleaded guilty to both crimes on June 7. This was reported by the
  Associated Press and The New York Times, but never appeared on
  the networks. <p>

  Alice Hand was arrested in January 1995 for making at least three
  phone calls threatening to blow-up a Catholic church and school
  in Suffern, New York. Hand wanted revenge on the Catholic Church,
  which she believed was partly to blame for pro-life violence. The
  New York Times ran a 288-word story on January 17, but the
  incident never appeared on any of the networks. <p>

  While the networks devoted 142 stories to violence outside
  clinics, only three alluded to violence inside the clinics. CNN's
  September 12 World News broadcast one segment about abortionist David
  Benjamin, who was convicted of second degree murder in New York
  City for allowing a woman to bleed to death from a perforated
  uterus during an abortion. Not one segment mentioned the rate of
  abortions in the United States in 1993 or 1994, but two segments
  aired estimates in 1995. On the August 23 Today show, Dawn
  Fratangelo reported a new study estimated that &quot; one-quarter of
  the world's pregnancies end in abortion,&quot;  while the August 30 NBC
  Nightly News mentioned there are 1.5 million abortions per year
  in the United States. <p>

  With 1995 ushering in a new Republican-controlled Congress, the
  media predicted the death of the right to abortion while betting
  it would be an issue that threatens the survival of the Republican
  majority. After Senators voted to make the gruesome partial birth
  abortion procedure illegal on December 7, NBC's Bryant Gumbel
  opened the next day's Today show with this exaggerated claim:
  &quot; Good Morning. Congress is a step closer this morning to eliminating a
  woman's choice in abortion.&quot; <p>
  During the congressional fight over the nomination of Dr. Henry
  Foster as Surgeon General, NBC's Jim Miklaszewski on the February
  9 Today show felt this would eventually be a win for President
  Clinton: &quot; White House officials claim conservative Republicans
  want to turn Foster's nomination into a fight over abortion. In that
  case, Clinton aides admit they could still lose the nomination,
  but would ultimately win the war of public opinion over choice and
  help push the Republicans further right from center.&quot;  CBS anchor
  Connie Chung also saw abortion as bringing about the demise of the
  Republican Party on the February 15 CBS Evening News: &quot; Republican
  use of the abortion issue against Dr. Henry Foster's nomination
  as Surgeon General seems to be backfiring tonight. The deep stress
  cracks over abortion policy are now starting to show inside the
  Republican Party.&quot; <p>
  Once again, a year passed with the concerns of pro-lifers ignored
  by the networks. Women who regret abortions, how the abortion
  industry operates relatively free of government regulation, the
  large sums of money made by the abortion industry, government
  subsidies to Planned Parenthood -- all went unreported in 1995. <p>

  <h3>C. Homosexuality (113 total stories in 1995; 105 in
  1994; 756 in 1993)<p></h3>

  The number of stories primarily about homosexuality remained
  about the same between 1994 and 1995. Both years were much lower
  than 1993 when the gays in the military debate dominated the news
  for a few months. In 1995, 59 evening show segments were
  broadcast focusing on gay issues, the same number as in 1994.
  Morning shows aired 48 stories in 1995, up from the 37 broadcast
  in 1994.<p>

  Magazine show segments dropped from nine in 1994 to six in 1995. 
  But the networks demonstrated a liberal orientation once again:
  most of the segments featured gays in a positive light while
  rarely presenting those who opposed the gay agenda. In what few
  interview segments there were on the morning shows, the number of pro-gay
  agenda guests outnumbered the anti-gay agenda guests by thirteen
  to three. <p>

  <h3>D. Religious Right (17 evening stories in 1995; 12 in
  1994; 15 in 1993)<p></h3>

  In the 34 total segments and one hour CBS Reports special, the
  media reported on Christian conservatives in 1995 as an
  intolerant and divisive force in American politics willing to
  dishonestly manipulate voters into casting a ballot for their
  candidates. The label &quot; extremist&quot;  sometimes popped up in a
  discussion of Christian conservatives. Bryant Gumbel asked Gary
  Hart on the October 17 Today: &quot; How do you view the GOP's
  courtship of the extreme and religious right?&quot; <p>

  The networks portrayed the Christian Coalition as a negative
  force in the Republican Party. Today co-host Katie Couric
  reflected this view in a February 13 interview with Ralph Reed
  about the effect his organization, the Christian Coalition, would
  have on the presidential race: &quot; Do you believe, Mr. Reed, that
  your stand will divide the Republican Party in a way that will
  make it difficult, if not impossible, to win in the election in
  1996? And isn't that what went wrong in the last election for
  George Bush?&quot;  On the September 8 CBS Evening News, Linda Douglass
  also saw sure defeat for a candidate with Christian right
  support: &quot; Christian conservatives may not have the power to
  anoint a candidate, but they might be able to defeat one.
  Embracing their views may help to win the Republican nomination,
  but it could cost votes in the general election.&quot; <p>

  While the networks would not suggest that a liberal group like
  the NAACP doesn't represent all black people, CBS suggested the
  Christian Coalition did not represent all Christians -- or
  suggested they were less than Christian. Rather introduced
  Douglass's September 8 story by noting Phil Gramm &quot; was at a
  meeting of preacher Pat Robertson's political group, the one calling
  itself the Christian Coalition.&quot;  Four months earlier, on May 15, Rather
  charged: &quot; The group calling itself the Christian Coalition is
  aligned with hard-right stands on issues ranging from gay rights
  to school prayer, and it's demanding its due for its help in getting
  Republicans elected.&quot; The networks also suggested conservatives weren't honest about
  their politics. Paula Zahn's question on the November 15 This
  Morning to the director of the liberal Texas Freedom Alliance:
  &quot; Hasn't some of your criticism been, though, that they have
  funded stealth candidates? That these people have not been honest about
  what their agenda is as they go around campaigning?&quot;       
  Some of the worst bias towards the Christian right was broadcast
  during the murder trial of Susan Smith, who drowned her two sons.
  The same media which decried Newt Gingrich's 1992
  characterization of Woody Allen having Democratic family values took a gratuitous
  slap at the Christian Coalition. Both CBS and NBC aired reports
  mentioning, as NBC reporter Bob Dotson described on July 28, that
  Susan Smith's &quot; stepfather, Bev Russell, former Republican Party
  chairman and once active in the Christian Coalition, began
  molesting Susan just before her 16th birthday.&quot; <p>

  The usually little covered religious left garnered a few pieces
  during the year. These segments were mostly platforms for the
  religious left to attack the religious right. NBC's Bob Abernethy
  profiled leftist activist Rev. Jim Wallis who mounted a campaign
  to bash Christian pro-family conservatives. Anchor Brian Williams
  introduced the May 20 piece: "The religious right is continuing a
  political offensive it started a few years ago but there is a
  growing number of religious people who find the conservative
  agenda offensive.&quot; <p>

  Abernethy then aired Wallis's attack: &quot; His biggest problem with
  the Christian Coalition is its programs towards the poor. Wallis
  is a founder of Sojourners Religious Community which believes
  Christianity requires ministry to the poor.&quot;  Then Abernethy posed
  the question, &quot; And when Christians identify with the rich and
  powerful?&quot;  Wallis replied, &quot; I don't want to overstate this but I
  think that's a heresy. &quot;   Abernethy left out the far-left agenda of
  Sojourners, the magazine that Wallis edited; nor did he mention
  that Wallis was once quoted as saying he hoped &quot; more Christians
  will view the world through Marxist eyes.&quot;  Network coverage
  suggested the &quot; stealth&quot;  political tactics of the religious are
  newsworthy only if they are coming from the right. <p>

<h2>IV. RECOMMENDATIONS AND FOLLOW-UP</h2>

Network coverage of religion and religious issues would improve
considerably if reporters, producers, and anchors would work
harder on the following items:<p>
<ol>
<li> Devote more resources and air time to covering religion news.
The networks have no excuse to keep religion news in a
one-percent ghetto. The role of religion in the larger society,
from private philanthropy to political struggles like Henry
Foster's Surgeon General nomination, were eminently newsworthy
and attention-grabbing in 1995, and yet the networks continue to
slight religion as a major motivating force in Americans' private
and public lives.<p> 

<li> When covering religion, try harder to present religious issues
in a fair-minded, objective way. Network reporters are veterans
at the top of their field. Surely, they cannot protest they don't
know how to present both sides of a story, and they cannot
protest that stories attacking traditional religious "dogma"
without an opposing view is objective journalism. Reporters
should balance the Pope with his critics, but you can't balance a
story with 25 soundbites of critics and no defenders.<p>

<li> Present the social positions of religious figures fairly and
without contempt. The networks continue to label traditional
religious positions on social issues as &quot; extreme&quot;  or &quot; hard
right.&quot;  Is that label accurate for many Catholic clergymen who
are opposed to abortion, but also opposed to capital punishment
and current welfare reform proposals? Ideological identification
is useful to viewers, but current practices serve more to
stigmatize and caricature religious figures. More nuance and
balance is essential.<p>

Reporters also signal their contempt by underlining their opinion
that traditional religious stands are unpopular. An earlier Media
Research Center study of print and network abortion coverage from
July 1994 through June 1995 found that 48 stories suggested
abortion would damage Republican chances for election, while only
one story suggested it would help. But how does that jibe with
the fact that not one pro-life incumbent lost in the 1994
elections? <p>

<li> Hire a religion reporter, and reporters who are religious. ABC
hired Peggy Wehmeyer early in 1994, and she remains the only
explicitly assigned religion reporter at the networks. Wehmeyer
reported 11 stories in ABC's significantly longer &quot; American
Agenda&quot;  format in 1995, the same number as 1994. Wehmeyer was
outnumbered by full-time general assignment reporter Bill
Blakemore, who often covered the Pope for ABC. Time religion
writer Richard Ostling logged six stories for PBS. NBC's Bob
Abernethy continued as a semi-retired &quot; contributing correspondent
on religion.&quot;  CNN and CBS have yet to hire a regular religion
correspondent. The hostile, even partisan tone of some program
content suggests no effort to increase people of faith in the
newsroom. The strong dedication national journalism organizations
publicly declare toward diversity in the newsroom is still
unextended to people of faith.<p>
</ol>
Some recommendations from past MRC studies have led to better
reporting. In 1993, 25 network news stories focused on
unsubstantiated charges of sexual abuse made against Joseph
Cardinal Bernardin. Like 1994, the networks did refrain from
sensationalism in covering serious charges of clerical sexual
abuse. We also recommended that religion news not follow the
formula that `good news is no news.' <p>

On this front, the networks continue to show improvement: Network
reporters did show viewers some examples of the good news that
religion brings to America. On the November 7 World News Tonight,
ABC's Peter Jennings made a startling discovery: &quot; In Texas, there
is a faith-based program which has been remarkably effective in
dealing with alcohol and drug addiction. It does not cost the
taxpayers a cent." Peggy Wehmeyer reported: &quot; A recent University
of Tennessee study showed that 70 percent of Teen Challenge
[program] graduates were drug-free after six months,&quot;  compared
with a state-funded rehabilitation specialist's suggestion that a
25 percent rate would be &quot; very good.&quot;  Acknowledgments that
religion can lead to a better society, in both large systemic
strokes and much smaller personal revelations, might serve as a
comforting respite from the &quot; hell in a handbasket&quot;  tone so many
Americans associate with the network news.</i></b>

<p>


	WASHINGTON, MARCH 29, 1996</B> -- Congress approval today of legislation 
scrapping Depression-era crop programs that make U.S. farmers dependent on government and 
cost taxpayers billions of dollars was immediately praised as a &QUOT;dramatic and welcome&QUOT; step in 
the right direction.<P>
	&QUOT;For the first time in more than six decades, farmers will grow for the market, not for the 
government,&QUOT; said <a href="/heritage/staff/fryden.htm">John Frydenlund</a>, director of the Heritage Foundations Agriculture Policy 
Project and one of the architects of the <a href="/heritage/library/categories/enviro/ib221.html">reform plan</a>. &QUOT;Consumers win with more competitive 
prices, taxpayers win with lower government spending on subsidies, and farmers win with the 
freedom to grow for the rapidly expanding world market.&QUOT;<P>
	The legislation, while it doesnt go as far as Frydenlund had recommended, will replace 
open-ended subsidies for crops such as corn, wheat, cotton and rice with a system of &QUOT;transition 
payments&QUOT; -- guaranteed payments that decline and eventually cease by the year 2002.<P>
	When Frydenlund first proposed the elimination of agriculture subsidy programs in an 
April 1995 Heritage Foundation study, &QUOT;Freeing Americas Farmers,&QUOT; few in Washington gave 
his recommendations much chance of passage. Yet the House-Senate conference report on 
agriculture, which is expected to be signed into law by President Clinton, pushes policy 
dramatically in the same direction -- eliminating government programs that rob American 
consumers and taxpayers of billions of dollars and deny farmers the ability to profit from the 
explosive growth in the global demand for food.<P>
	Frydenlund says that although the farm bill failed to reform the costly sugar and peanut 
programs, &QUOT;it is a dramatic and welcome departure from 60 years of command-and-control 
agriculture policy.&QUOT;<P>
	The reform plan proposed by Frydenlund, had it been adopted in its entirety, would have 
phased out all crop subsidies and support payments over five years and, according to a detailed 
computer analysis, would have added $35 billion to the economy of rural America over that same 
period of time.<P>

<hr><h2>HOUSE HEALTH-CARE REFORM PLAN BETTER THAN KASSEBAUM-KENNEDY PLAN
</h2></center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations<br>
<p>

	WASHINGTON, MARCH 27, 1996</b> -- A health-care <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/bgup271.html">reform bill</a> scheduled for a 
vote in the House of Representatives this Thursday would go a long way toward solving the 
problems of availability, portability and affordability of health insurance, more so than the 
Senate measure sponsored by Sens. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., and Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., 
a Heritage Foundation analyst said today.<p>
	&quot;Anxiety about todays health-insurance coverage stems from the fact that coverage is 
tied to the workplace,&quot; says Health Care Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/liu.htm">John Liu</a>. &quot;Workers and dependents are covered 
by an employer-based health-insurance policy only as long as they remain with the same 
employer. If a worker loses his job, he gets no tax break if he buys individual coverage, and if he 
takes another job, he may encounter difficulties getting new coverage if he has a pre-existing 
medical condition.&quot;<p> 
	The Senate bill tries to address these problems, Liu says, but it fails to treat the problems 
at their source: the fact that health insurance -- unlike other types of insurance -- is owned by 
employers, rather than individual workers. This anomaly, he notes, is encouraged by the tax 
code.<p>
	Sponsored by eight House members, the Health Coverage and Affordability Act would 
enable Americans to keep their health insurance when they change or lose their jobs, allow 
individuals to purchase health insurance outside of the workplace, and allow self-employed 
individuals to deduct 50 percent (up from the current 30 percent) of the amount paid for health 
insurance for themselves and their dependents. The House legislation is being coordinated by 
Rep. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.<p>
	Effective health-care reform, Liu says, would offer the following:<br>
<ul>
	<li> Group-to-Group portability/tax equity. The best way to achieve portability, Liu says, is 
to give Americans the ability to purchase health insurance independent of their employers, and 
still receive the tax breaks they get for employer-based insurance. This would benefit most of 
todays uninsured, especially the self-employed and those working at small firms that are  unable 
to provide health insurance, the Heritage analyst says.<p>
	<li> Limits on exclusions for pre-existing medical conditions for those who lose employer-
based coverage. Liu says Kassebaum-Kennedys guaranteed availability and renewability of 
health insurance is &quot;a welcome and long-overdue improvement in todays health insurance 
market.&quot; The House proposal would similarly limit the ability of insurance carriers to impose 
eligibility or enrollment requirements based on health status, medical condition, claims 
experience or medical history.<p>
	<li> Group-purchasing arrangements to allow small employers and associations to pool their 
purchasing power and get reasonably priced coverage. Kassebaum-Kennedy attempts -- through 
creation of so-called Health Plan Purchasing Cooperatives (HPPCs) -- to make insurance more 
affordable for small employers and the self-employed. But, Liu says, because HPPCs would 
receive more favorable treatment from certain state laws than other types of plans, they would 
have an unfair advantage. &quot;Instead of creating an uneven playing field, Congress should ensure 
that all health plans, whether issued through a HPPC or not, are treated equally,&quot; Liu says.<p>
</ul>
	&quot;To achieve true health-insurance reform, Kassebaum-Kennedy must incorporate key 
proposals from the Health Coverage Availability and Affordability Act now making its way 
through the House. Only then can Congress give working Americans what they want from 
health-insurance reform: true portability and more choice through the purchase of  individual 
policies that provide long-term protection against catastrophic illness. If Americans are allowed 
to comparison shop among a variety of health plans, costs can be controlled,&quot; Liu says.<p>

<h2>U.S. SHOULD OPPOSE CHINA'S EFFORTS TO DELAY<BR>
GLOBAL FREE TRADE WITH TAIWAN, ANALYST SAYS<BR></center></h2><p>

 
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations<br><p>
WASHINGTON, MARCH 22, 1996</b> -- In addition to threatening Taiwan militarily, the Peoples Republic of China is trying to prevent the island nation from gaining entry to the World Trade Organization (WTO) before China itself does -- a move the United States <a href="/heritage/library/categories/trade/ascbg140.html">should oppose</a>, says an Asia analyst at The Heritage Foundation.
<p>	One of Americas largest trading partners, Taiwan is taking steps to meet the economic requirements for entry into the WTO, the organization that sets the rules for international free trade, says Heritage Asian Trade and Economics Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/oquinn.htm">Robert OQuinn</a>. These include lifting all import bans and slashing tariffs on foreign goods, which would boost trade between Taiwan and other countries, including the United States. 
<p>
	But theres a problem. &quot;The most significant obstacle to Taiwans membership in the 
WTO is not economic, it is political,&quot; OQuinn says. &quot;China insists that Taiwan should not join 
the WTO before China does.&quot; This is true even though Taiwans economy is more advanced than 
Chinas. For China, however, the chief concern is that the world recognize its status as a global 
economic power and its primacy over Taiwan, something it feels is threatened if Taiwan gains 
entry to the WTO first.<p>
	Although the United States cannot unilaterally set the terms for WTO admittance, it 
should &quot;be prepared to exercise international leadership to support Taiwans membership, even 
in the face of Chinas determined opposition,&quot; OQuinn says. In addition, the United States 
should work closely with the European Union and Japan -- the other key players in the trade 
organization -- to build a consensus within the WTO for admitting China only on &quot;commercially 
viable&quot; terms, not for political reasons.<p> 
	Unfortunately, OQuinn says, the Clinton administration seems willing to bow to Chinas 
demands, a position at odds with U.S. economic goals. &quot;As the worlds largest exporter, the 
United States has an interest in seeing that arbitrary political criteria are not applied to WTO 
applicants,&quot; he says. &quot;Any state or territory willing and able to meet the WTOs economic 
criteria should be free to join.&quot;<p>
	This is not to say the administration shouldnt look for ways to let both countries join the 
WTO at the same time, which would &quot;be the best outcome for all parties,&quot; OQuinn says. But 
that may not be possible. China -- with its high tariffs, strict import controls, and anti-
competitive industrial policy -- must do much more to reform its economy than Taiwan before it 
can qualify for entry.<p>  
	OQuinn says there is a way the Clinton administration might get China not only to speed 
up its economic reforms, but to drop its opposition to Taiwan-first WTO entry: Offer China 
permanent &quot;most-favored nation&quot; (MFN) trading status. This is something China values highly, 
so much so that it might be willing to make concessions. OQuinn says the administration should 
ask Congress for the authority to exempt China from the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, the 1975 
law that requires Chinas MFN status to be renewed every year.<p>
	In the meantime, OQuinn says, the administration should continue to insist that Taiwans 
entry into the WTO not be held hostage to Chinas demands. &quot;Taiwan should join the WTO 
when it is ready,&quot; he says, &quot;not when Beijing says it can.&quot;<p>

<h2>GOVERNORS' WELFARE REFORM PLAN FAILS<BR>
TO TACKLE ILLEGITIMACY, ANALYST SAYS<BR></center></h2><p>

 
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations<br><p>

NGA Plan a Poor Model<br>
For Upcoming Legislation<br><p>
WASHINGTON, MARCH 19, 1995</b>  -- The welfare reform plan developed by the nations governors for use  as a reform model on Capitol Hill completely ignores illegitimacy -- the No. 1 problem experts have identified as perpetuating the welfare culture, a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/bg1075.html">Heritage Foundation</a> analyst said today.

<p>
According to<a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm"> Robert Rector</a>, senior analyst for welfare and family issues, &QUOT;Illegitimacy and 
family collapse are the keys that open the door not only to perpetual welfare dependency, but to a host 
of other problems such as crime, poverty, drug abuse and school failure. Yet the National Governors 
Association (NGA) not only has abandoned the goal of reducing illegitimacy, it has devised a plan that 
would  provide even more government-funded support services to an expanding population of single 
mothers.&QUOT;<P>
	Thus, the NGA plan, &QUOT;sets the stage for an unavoidable and explosive rise in welfare and social 
service spending in the future,&QUOT; Rector says. A combined welfare-Medicaid reform package is expected 
to be introduced in Congress this month and taken up by the House and Senate in May. Rector says 
Congress would do well to &QUOT;just say no to the welfare reform plan offered by the NGA and pass instead 
legislation that makes reducing illegitimacy, encouraging marriage, and requiring work top priorities.&QUOT;<P>
	&QUOT;By refusing to acknowledge or even mention the collapse of marriage, the governors are 
implicitly condoning and (through inaction) ultimately promoting the skyrocketing rise in illegitimacy. 
They are embarked on a path which will lead, in the near future, to half of all children being born out 
of wedlock and raised in government-supported day care centers,&QUOT; Rector warns. &QUOT;This is not reform; it 
is a national disaster.&QUOT;<P> 
	Rector points out that nearly a third of all children born in America last year were born out of 
wedlock. Within the black community, the out-of-wedlock birth rate is now 69 percent. The 
illegitimate birth rate among whites is nearly 25 percent, almost equaling the black rate in the 1960s 
when policy-makers -- notably Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., -- warned of the consequences 
associated with the erosion of marriages in black families. <P>
	Rector says children born out of wedlock are seven times more likely to be poor than are those 
born to couples who stay married. Girls raised in single-parent homes on welfare are five times more 
likely to give birth out of wedlock themselves when compared to girls from intact families not on 
welfare. Often, they repeat the mothers pattern of having a child and applying for welfare, thus 
continuing the generational cycle of dependence. A poor boy from a single-parent home in the inner 
city is twice as likely to engage in crime compared to a similar boy living with both parents.<P>
	Not only does the NGA plan fail to address illegitimacy, it also guts the work requirements 
from the last House-Senate conference bill, according to Rector.<P>  
	&QUOT;There are so many loopholes in the NGA plan that no welfare recipients would be required to 
work,&QUOT; he says.  Just one example: Up to 20 percent of recipients counted as working can be enrolled in 
vocational education, a remedy that has proved ineffective in the past.<P>
	&QUOT;Just as it did in 1988, the NGA is offering cosmetic welfare reform,&QUOT; Rector says. &QUOT;The public 
was told that welfare would be replaced by work. Then, as now, the NGA opposed real work 
requirements. As a consequence, welfare reform resulted in an explosion of day care funding, and 
welfare caseloads grew by some 30 percent. Now, it looks like history is about to repeat itself.&QUOT;<P>

<h2>FLAT-TAX PLAN WOULD LOWER TAXES<br>

<p>

        WASHINGTON, MARCH 14, 1996</b> --  A Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi90.html">analysis</a> of the 17-
percent flat-tax plan sponsored by House Majority Leader Richard Armey, R-Texas, and Sen. 
Richard Shelby, R-Ala., shows &quot;no increase in the taxes paid by the vast majority of middle-class 
Americans when compared with their current tax burden.&quot;<p>
	In fact, on average, a 17 percent flat tax would lower taxes on all income groups, 
according to the report by William Beach, visiting fellow in tax analysis, and Daniel Mitchell, 
McKenna senior fellow in political economy.<p>
	A <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi90t1.gif">table</a> provided by the Heritage analysts, based on IRS income-tax files for 1991, shows 
that under a 17 percent flat tax, households with less than $15,000 per year in taxable income 
will experience a nearly 50 percent drop in their tax burden. In fact, &quot;About 24 million families 
who pay federal income taxes now will pay no federal income taxes under the fully implemented 
Armey-Shelby flat tax,&quot; the analysts say, &quot;and nearly everyone else below $30,000 in taxable 
income will see their taxes fall.&quot;<p>
	For example, households whose taxable income ranges between $15,000 to $30,000 per 
year would see nearly a 36 percent drop in federal taxes. Those in the $30,000 to $50,000 range 
would pay almost 16 percent less; and those in the $50,000 to $75,000 taxable-income range 
would pay almost 12 percent less.<p>
	Will lower taxes mean higher deficits for the federal government? Not according to the 
Heritage analysts, who say the loss in individual income tax revenue under the Armey-Shelby 
plan will be offset by increased revenue from middle-sized and big businesses. &quot;Corporate 
income taxes increase under an Armey-Shelby flat tax,&quot; the Heritage analysts point out. &quot;This 
largely offsets decreases in individual income tax payments during the two years it will take to 
implement this tax reform. Taxes from individuals will fall by $51 billion, while taxes from 
corporations will rise by $52 billion.&quot; <p>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>

<p>


                        WASHINGTON, MARCH 13, 1996</b> -- Hailed as a bold move to roll back big 
government by returning power to the states, the Medicaid-reform plan touted by the nations 
governors actually preserves some of the worst elements of the program and creates a costly new 
state entitlement to federal money, according to a new Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/fyi89.html">analysis</a>.<P>
	Unless changes are made to the plan, which forms the basis of legislation being crafted by 
the congressional leadership, it &QUOT;will be a disaster rather than a reform,&QUOT; says Heritage Health Care Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/liu.htm">John Liu</a>. To prevent this outcome, he says, Congress should limit the 
categories of Americans guaranteed coverage under Medicaid and cancel the open-ended state 
entitlement to federal money.<P>
	According to Liu, the governors plan claims to scrap the Medicaid entitlement in favor 
of a system of block grants (or cash payments) to the states, yet preserves a long list of benefits 
that must be provided to a large, entitled population.  In fact, of the 33 million Americans on 
Medicaid in 1993, fully 71 percent would still be guaranteed benefits under the governors plan.<P>
&QUOT;The governors plan is not an elimination, nor even a significant scaling back, of the current and 
costly entitlement feature of Medicaid,&QUOT; Liu says.<P>
	Since the governors decision to guarantee Medicaid coverage to so many people will 
impose heavy burdens on state budgets, Liu says, they also included an &QUOT;umbrella insurance&QUOT; 
provision that entitles states to federal money.  If states experience an unanticipated rise in the 
number of people eligible for Medicaid, the federal government would bear the cost, which 
almost certainly would increase the federal deficit.  &QUOT;The states have figured out a way to write 
blank checks on the federal treasury,&QUOT; Liu says.  This is hard to justify, he says, when the federal 
share of Medicaid costs is projected to reach $100 billion this fiscal year.<P>
	If Medicaid reform is to go beyond merely cosmetic changes, Liu says, Congress must fix 
these problems. First, lawmakers should sharply limit who is entitled to what under Medicaid, 
focusing benefits on the truly needy such as the homeless and mentally ill.  Second, Congress 
should turn the state entitlement to &QUOT;umbrella insurance&QUOT; into an annual appropriation with a 
fixed amount of money. This would give states needed protection from sudden increases in the 
Medicaid population, but not an open pipeline to the federal treasury.<P>
	&QUOT;If Congress is to enact a federal balanced budget over the next seven years, then 
Medicaid ... will require more, not less, fiscal discipline,&QUOT; Liu says.  Without changes, he says, 
the governors Medicaid reform plan &QUOT;should be unacceptable to lawmakers seeking a reform of 
the open-ended entitlement status of todays program.&QUOT;  <P>

<h2>"TEAM B" ADVISES CONGRESS: WITHDRAW FROM ABM, BUILD MISSILE DEFENSES<br>
</h2></center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>

Administration &QUOT;More Interested In Defending<BR> 
ABM Treaty Than Defending America&QUOT;<p>
WASHINGTON, MARCH 12, 1996</b> -- The United States should withdraw from the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty and adopt a plan for defending America from ballistic missile attack by building effective sea-based and space-based defenses, the Heritage Foundations "Team B" missile defense study team <a href="/heritage/library/categories/natsec/bg1074.html">said today</a>.<p>

	Top priority, the study panel said, should be given to expanding the Navys Aegis air-
defense system with a missile-defense component able to protect wide areas of the United States 
and other countries from incoming ballistic missiles by the year 1999. Ultimately, America 
should aim for cooperation among allied nations in building the kind of international anti-
ballistic missile system called for by former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher this 
weekend, the panel said.<P>
	Leading Republicans in the House and Senate are expected to introduce missile-defense 
legislation on Thursday of this week, and both houses of Congress will hold hearings shortly 
thereafter, extending into April.<P> 
	The Heritage Foundation panel, led by former Strategic Defense Initiative Organization 
Director Amb. Henry Cooper, says in its report that Congress needs to face up to the fact that the 
Clinton administration has no intention of defending Americans against the threat of ballistic 
missile attack. In short, the administration considers the 1972 ABM Treaty more important than 
missile defenses -- a conclusion with which the panel sharply disagrees.<P>

ABM Treaty or ABM/TMD Treaty?<p>
	The Team B consensus is that no long-term, effective defense of the American people 
against ballistic missiles can be built within the constraints of the ABM Treaty. &QUOT; The ABM 
Treaty is stifling the development of todays most capable and effective defense systems and 
perpetuating the vulnerability of the American people and their troops, bases and allies 
overseas,&QUOT; Team B says. &QUOT;Continuing to appease the Russians in ABM Treaty negotiations 
delays U.S. efforts to build needed defenses, and may permanently impair American interests.&quot;<p> 
	&quot;The time has come for the United States to exercise its right under Article XV of the 
ABM Treaty to give six months notice to Russia, withdraw from the ABM Treaty, and build the 
needed defenses,&quot; the blue-ribbon panel says in the 1996 edition of &quot;Defending America: Ending 
Americas Vulnerability To Ballistic Missiles.&quot; <p>
	Yet, the Clinton administration not only exhibits &quot;a slavish adherence&quot; to a treaty signed 
with the now defunct Soviet Union, it even appears committed to expanding the treatys reach so 
it prevents the building of theater missile defenses (TMD). The administration reportedly has 
accepted the Russian demand to limit the performance of the most promising theater missile 
defenses. It has even &quot;dumbed down&quot; the capabilities of theater defense systems rather than 
make them as capable as available technology will permit<p>. 
	In short, &quot;if the administration has its way, no highly effective theater defense will be 
built. The administration has shown clearly that it prefers defending the Treaty to defending 
Americans,&qupt; Team B concludes.<p>
Administration Obfuscation<p>	
	&quot;The administrations actions over the past year, characterized chiefly by the presidents 
veto of the fiscal 1996 defense authorization bill, demonstrate that the American people cannot 
depend on the executive branch to fulfill its chief constitutional duty -- to provide for the 
common defense -- even though the missile threat continues to grow,&quot; the Team B report says.<p>
	&quot;While publicly claiming it is vigorously pursuing missile defenses, the administration
has quietly canceled or sharply curtailed development of the most effective, least expensive 
missile defense programs, while supporting more expensive, less effective ones and extending 
their development time, thereby increasing costs,&quot; Team B says. &quot;It has become regrettably clear 
that the Clinton administration cannot be relied upon to carry out its own stated policy.&quot;    <p>
The Threat<p>
	The United States still has no defense whatsoever against intercontinental ballistic 
missiles (ICBMs). &quot;Contrary to what most Americans believe,&quot; the Team B analysts say, &quot;if  an 
ICBM were launched at the United States today -- by accident or design -- there is not a single 
thing the U.S. military could do to stop the warhead or multiple warheads from reaching their 
targets and killing hundreds of thousands, possible millions, of Americans.&quot;<p>
	The Clinton administration argues that there is no ballistic missile threat to the American 
homeland and that there will be sufficient warning to build needed defenses before such a threat 
develops. &quot;Yet, American cities can be destroyed today by Russian and Chinese missiles,&quot; Team 
B points out. &quot;A Chinese official recently threatened to destroy Los Angeles if the United States 
interfered with Chinas feud with Taiwan. North Koreas nuclear and missile programs recently 
prompted the commander of U.S. forces in South Korea to request that theater missile defense 
development be expedited. Also, U.N. inspectors fear that an Iraqi missile program exposed last 
year is more extensive than previously thought and could enable Saddam Hussein to fire 
chemical, biological or nuclear weapons at targets up to 2,000 miles away. Rogue states could 
threaten U.S. cities with long-range missile attack in three to five years -- sooner if they chose to 
accelerate their development plans,&quot; Team B analysts say. <p>
What Congress Should Do?<p>
	Team B says &quot;America should indicate clearly to the Russians that the United States 
intends to provide effective wide-area defenses for the American people and their overseas troops 
and allies -- and that it would prefer to do so with Russias agreement.&quot; However, if Russia 
refuses to cooperate, &quot;Congress should use all available powers and prerogatives to move 
America toward withdrawal from the ABM Treaty after giving six months notice, which it has a 
right to do under Article XV,&quot; say the Team B analysts. <p>
	Then, Congress should &quot;press for deployment of the least expensive, most effective near-
term defenses technically feasible. This means a de-emphasis of ground-based defenses -- since 
they can be overcome by countermeasures, are expensive, and are difficult to deploy. Highest 
priority should be assigned to expanding and converting the Navys Aegis air-defense system to 
missile defense and deploying theater defenses based on this model by the year 1999.&quot;<p> 
	&quot;For an investment of $2 billion to $3 billion, 650 defensive interceptors on 22 Aegis 
cruisers could be at sea by 2001, achieving a limited global missile-defense capability for the 
United States and for U.S. forces and allies overseas,&quot; the Team B analysts say. &quot;These highly 
mobile platforms could defend Americans in all 50 states from a limited long-range missile 
strike, as well as defend American troops and allies overseas.&quot;<p>
	In addition, the development of space-based sensors and defenses, both kinetic-energy 
interceptors and lasers, should be revived and accelerated, the Team B analysts say. &quot;With the 
necessary funding support, deployment of such systems can begin shortly after the year 2000. 
For planning purposes consistent with this objective, Team B recommends that $1.6 billion, $2.4 
billion and $3 billion, respectively, be budgeted for 1999, 2000, and 2001.&quot;<p>
	&quot;The Clinton administration continues to keep Americans vulnerable while hiding behind 
a smokescreen of positive-sounding but meaningless policy declarations,&quot; the Team B analysts 
conclude. &quot;It is clear that the Clinton administration will remain derelict in the duties required of 
the office of the commander-in-chief by failing to provide for the common defense. Congress 
must fulfill its constitutional duty to check the excesses of the executive branch. It must stop the 
improper attempts to broaden the ABM Treaty and counterbalance the executives dereliction of 
duty by pressing for the most capable and effective missile defense technology will permit.&quot;<p>

<title>New White House Budget Contains Big Spending, Tax Increases, Study Shows - Heritage PR</title>

<h2>New White House Budget Contains Big Spending, Tax Increases, Study Shows</h2></center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>




                WASHINGTON, MARCH 11, 1996</b> -- Although the 1996 budget battle between 
Congress and the White House is still unresolved, President Clinton has already released a new 
1997 budget that boosts spending by $361 billion and tax revenues by $526 billion over the next 
seven years, according to a<a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1071.html"> new report</a> by The Heritage Foundation.<P>
	For every household in America, the new White House budget means $1,927 in higher 
taxes and $3,155 in higher spending over seven years, compared to the 1995 Balanced Budget 
Act that the president vetoed last fall, says Heritage budget specialist <a href="/heritage/staff/hodge.htm">Scott Hodge</a>.<P>
	Moreover, the White House budget would add $119 billion more in deficits through 2002 
than Congress Balanced Budget Act, the equivalent of increasing the debt burden on the average 
household by $1,227, Hodge says.<P>
	&quot;Just weeks after telling the nation in this years State of the Union address that the era 
of big government is over, President Clinton [has] indicated that the obituary notice was 
premature,&quot; says Hodge, Heritages Grover M. Hermann fellow in federal budgetary affairs.<p>
	He says while the White House plan would, on paper, balance the budget by 2002, it can 
only do so &quot;by leaving the real work of deficit reduction to a future president and Congress.&quot;  For 
example, the budget claims to save $596 billion over the next seven years, but fully 60 percent of 
that deficit reduction is scheduled to happen after President Clinton leaves office.<p>
	Whats more, the family tax cuts in the presidents plan come in the early years, then 
screech to a halt in 2002, the deadline for a balanced budget. The result: Families depending on a 
planned $500-per-child tax credit would get hit in 2002 with a $17 billion tax increase.  Whats 
more, the president offsets the $98 billion he proposes in tax cuts with $59 billion in tax 
increases.  The resulting net tax cut of $39 billion represents just 3 cents of every $1,000 
taxpayers will send to Washington over the next seven years, Hodge says.<p>
	While tax relief under the White House budget is negligible, spending on entitlement 
programs such as Medicaid and Medicare steams ahead, increasing by $365 billion, or 50 
percent, over seven years.  All told, spending on mandatory programs under the White House 
budget would rise from 49 cents of every federal dollar today to 59 cents of every federal dollar 
in 2002. <p> 
	And although the president proposes to reduce the growth of Medicare spending by $124 
billion over seven years, thats not nearly enough to save the program from impending 
bankruptcy, Hodge says.  In fact, the news that in 1995 the Medicare Hospital Insurance program 
paid out $36 million more in benefits than it took in from payroll taxes shows the program could 
face a financial crisis even sooner than the projected bankruptcy in 2002.<p>
	The situation with Medicaid is just as bad. If nothing is done to reform the program, 
Hodge says, states probably will need to raise taxes or cut spending by $146 billion over seven 
years to pay for it. The White House response is to slow Medicaid spending increases by $59 
billion over the same period, which does little good when maintaining the programs entitlement 
status could cost states more than $47 billion.<p>
	There is, Hodge says, one area of the budget where the White House does propose real 
changes: spending for social programs is greatly expanded.  While short on details -- which are 
scheduled to be supplied in the administrations full budget due later this month -- the current 
White House budget &quot;outlines a sweeping agenda of spending initiatives in areas such as 
education, high technology, crime fighting and the environment,&quot; Hodge says. Compared to the 
Balanced Budget Act, the president proposes spending an extra $111 billion over seven years on 
discretionary programs.<p>
	Yet oddly, Hodge says, the White House also claims to &quot;save&quot; $297 billion in 
discretionary programs over seven years.  Of course, these savings are calculated by using the 
Congressional Budget Offices &quot;baseline,&quot; which assumes automatic spending increases every 
year.  Under this accounting system, simply freezing discretionary spending at 1995 levels would 
&quot;save&quot; $258 billion over seven years.  The extra $39 billion the president proposes to save? 
Hodge says 95 percent of these cuts come in 2001 and 2002, when President Clinton can no 
longer be in office.<p> 
	&quot;The administrations repeated use of gimmicks and accounting ploys ... casts doubt on 
its sincerity in negotiating a balanced budget plan with Congress,&quot; Hodge says. &quot;The Clinton 
budget is not the end of big government,  it is the embodiment of it.&quot;<p>

<title>White House Retreat on Free Trade Bodes Ill for U.S. - Heritage PR</title>

BODES ILL FOR U.S., ANALYST SAYS</h2></center>





<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>

	WASHINGTON, MARCH 6, 1996</b> -- Bowing to protectionist pressure, the White House is backing away from its commitment to free trade in the Western Hemisphere, a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/trade/bg1070.html">policy shift</a> that could derail the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), damage relations with Mexico and discredit U.S. leadership on free trade, a Heritage Foundation analyst said today.
<p>	Opponents of free trade have accused NAFTA of causing everything from the Mexican economic crisis and declining U.S. wages to increased illegal immigration and drug trafficking. The fact that the White House has allowed such charges to go unanswered shows that "free trade is no longer a high priority for the Clinton administration," says Heritage Latin America Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/sweeney.htm">John Sweeney</a>.
<p>
	On the contrary, over the past year the White House has taken steps to downgrade NAFTA, first by reneging on a promise to include Chile in NAFTA by 1996 and then by violating key provisions of the trade pact such as allowing Mexican trucks to operate in U.S. border states. 
<p>	If the Clinton administration continues to shirk its obligations under NAFTA, Sweeney says, it will establish "a negative precedent that Mexico, Canada and other countries could follow in the future." Even now, Sweeney says, political leaders throughout Latin America are questioning the administration's commitment to free trade. The possible result: "If Latin America's emerging capitalist democracies feel that U.S. leadership is weakening, they may reach out to Europe or Asia for the support that America is failing to provide," he says.
<p>	To prevent NAFTA from falling into disrepute, Sweeney says the White House must take a number of steps to strengthen the treaty. Not only should the administration respect NAFTA's provisions, it should complete the trade pact's unfinished business with Mexico, which includes forgiving Mexico's public debt and working out solutions to immigration, labor and law-enforcement problems. In addition, the White House should reverse course and speed up the process of admitting Chile to NAFTA.
<p>	Sweeney says the administration has nothing to fear from critics of NAFTA, whose charges have proven untrue. For example, the claim that NAFTA caused the Mexican economic crisis couldn't be more wrong. "The peso collapsed because the government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari sacrificed sound fiscal discipline on the altar of political expediency," he says.  "If not for NAFTA, the economic consequences of the peso's meltdown would have been far more serious."
<p>	NAFTA also remains crucial to U.S. competitiveness in the new global economy, Sweeney says. U.S. exports to Mexico since 1987 have grown at a rate two-and-a-half times faster than exports to the rest of the world. Even in 1995, when the Mexican economic crisis was at its worst, the United States still exported more to Mexico than it did before NAFTA. All told, the United States exports $98 billion worth of goods to Latin America every year -- more than half of that to Mexico -- supporting nearly 2 million U.S. jobs.
<p>	By backing away from free trade, and NAFTA, the White House is also threatening U.S. relations with Mexico, Sweeney says. NAFTA is crucial if Mexico is to emerge from its economic crisis. If that crisis continues, he says, strains in U.S.-Mexico relations are likely to grow, with conflicts over illegal immigration and drug trafficking displacing cooperation on trade and investment. Moreover, the United States has a strong interest in seeing Mexico become a stable, capitalist democracy. But "without NAFTA, [Mexican President Ernesto] Zedillo's chance of advancing political reforms would be very poor," Sweeney says.
<p>	If American relations with Mexico deteriorate through half-hearted U.S. support for NAFTA, the Clinton administration faces the risk of forfeiting America's leadership role as the champion of free trade in the Western Hemisphere, Sweeney says. In fact, the dream of creating a hemisphere-wide free-trade zone by the year 2005, ostensibly shared by the White House, could collapse.  
<p>	"The Clinton administration has lost sight of America's vital interests in the Western Hemisphere," Sweeney says. "The task for American policy-makers now is to correct the current drift in policy toward Mexico and Latin America as quickly as possible."

<html><title>Architect of Free-Market Farm Bill Assesses Congress' Reform Bill -- Heritage PR</title><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h2>News Release</h2><hr><a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
               214 Massachusetts Avenue NE<br>                     Washington, D.C. 20002<br>                              (202) 546-4400<br><hr><h2> ARCHITECT OF FREE-MARKET FARM PLAN
ASSESSES CONGRESS' REFORM BILL</h2>
</center>



<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<P>

	WASHINGTON, MARCH 5, 1996</b> -- A principal architect of the agriculture-reform plan moving through Congress praised the effort to replace America's Depression-era farm policy with a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/enviro/ib221.html">market-based system</a>, but said Congress' failure to eliminate the sugar and peanut programs would cost consumers billions of dollars per year in higher prices. 
<P>
	The House of Representatives last week passed the so-called Freedom to Farm Act, which incorporates many of the major structural changes proposed in the April 1995 Heritage Foundation study, "Freeing America's Farmers." The Senate passed similar legislation earlier this year.
<p>
	The legislation would end government programs that manipulate the production and prices of major crops through quotas and planting restrictions. Most dramatically, farm subsidies would be replaced by steadily decreasing "market-transition" payments that would end after seven years.  The House and Senate are expected to iron out differences between the two bills in conference this week.
<p>	"For the first time in more than six decades, farmers will grow for the market, not for the government," said <a href="/heritage/staff/fryden.htm">John Frydenlund</a>, director of Heritage's Agriculture Policy Project.  "Consumers win with more competitive prices, taxpayers win with lower government spending on subsidies, and farmers win with the freedom to grow for the rapidly expanding world market."
<p>	Published in advance of last year's congressional debate over reauthorizing America's farm programs, the Heritage farm policy blueprint also called for the elimination of the Farmer-Owned Reserve -- a surplus cache of crops the government uses to hold down commodity prices artificially by flooding the market.  This recommendation also was adopted by both the House and Senate.
<P>	While the farm bills mark a dramatic, and welcome, departure from command-and-control agriculture policy, Frydenlund says Congress should have adopted other elements of the Heritage plan as well. The failure to eliminate the sugar and peanut programs is one glaring omission, he says, as is leaving intact a component of the <a href="/heritage/library/categories/enviro/em448.html">dairy program</a> that will force Americans to pay above-market prices for milk. "A truly free-market approach to farm policy would have ended these programs," he says.
<P>	Frydenlund also says Congress should have done more to reform the Conservation Reserve Program, an environmental program that too often pays farmers to take productive land out of use. "The least Congress should do is let farmers remove non-environmentally sensitive land from the program," he says.
<p>	Another problem: Under the new system, market-transition payments will actually cost the government more in the first few years than traditional subsidies, an outcome Frydenlund warned against in a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/enviro/ib216.html">Heritage paper</a> in September of last year. At the time, he urged Congress to set a "trigger price" for commodities that, if exceeded, would cancel or reduce transition payments for a given year. This can be easily fixed, however, in the House-Senate conference, he says.
<P>	Despite these shortcomings, Frydenlund says the farm bills go further than any piece of legislation in U.S. history to create a free market for agriculture. "Outdated farm programs are robbing American consumers and taxpayers of billions of dollars a year and denying farmers the right to take advantage of explosive growth in the worldwide demand for food," he says.  "Congress has taken a huge step toward correcting these injustices."

<title>U.S. Shouldn't Rule Out Use of Force if China Attacks Taiwan - Heritage PR</title>

<b>Clinton's Weak Signals <br>
Risk Crisis In Taiwan Strait</b>

<center><h2>U.S. SHOULDN'T RULE OUT USE OF FORCE
IF CHINA ATTACKS TAIWAN, ANALYST SAYS</h2></center>
<b> For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations

<p>	WASHINGTON, MARCH 4, 1996</b> -- The Clinton administration should make clear to China that the United States will not tolerate an attack on Taiwan in response to the island nation's first-ever presidential elections March 23 -- nor should it rule out the <a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/asc139.html">use of force</a> in case of such an attack, a Heritage Foundation analyst said today.
<p>	According to <a href="/heritage/staff/fisher.htm">Richard Fisher</a>, senior analyst with Heritage's Asian Studies Center, the administration should order the U.S. Navy to hold exercises near Taiwan during the period before and after the March 23 presidential election to deter Chinese military action. Also, it should sell Taiwan defensive weapons in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act, including advanced air-to-air missiles, conventional submarines, and missile-defense systems.
<p>	"By failing to assure China's leaders of U.S. intentions in the event of a Chinese military attack against Taiwan, the Clinton administration is risking a clash that could do incalculable damage to Taiwan, U.S.-China relations and U.S. leadership in Asia," Fisher warns.
<p>	President Clinton therefore must take "strong but measured steps" to convey to Beijing America's clear interest in maintaining peace in the Taiwan Strait. Fisher says that in addition to warning China that U.S. force is an option, and deploying the U.S. Navy to deter Chinese military action, the Clinton administration should:
<p><ul>
<li>	 In compliance with the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, inform Chinese leaders that America will regard any attack on Taiwan as "a threat to peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United States";<p>
<li> Tell China it may face economic sanctions, ranging from removal of most-favored-nation trade status to a full U.S. economic embargo;<p>
<li> Maintain the balance of power in Asia by deploying missile defenses to protect U.S. forces stationed there, thus offsetting China's demonstrated willingness to use nuclear-capable missiles to intimidate Taiwan; and<p>
<li> Recognize Taiwan's democratic reforms and urge China and the Republic of China (ROC) to resolve their differences peacefully.
</ul><p>
	Ever since ROC President Lee Teng-hui's private visit to the United States on June 7-10, 1995, China has been militarily intimidating Taiwan and its emerging democratic system. Large-scale shows of force preceded Taiwan's legislative elections last December, and even larger maneuvers are underway as the presidential election approaches. "China fears the emergence of Taiwan as a model for political reform on the mainland, and continues to reserve the right to use military force against Taiwan should it declare independence," Fisher points out.
<p>	Fisher says President Clinton's failure to respond adequately to recent Chinese saber-rattling in the South China Sea and against Taiwan "fosters an impression of American weakness, and lends encouragement to Chinese hard-liners." He adds that "Several statements by Clinton administration officials to the effect that the United States will not defend Taiwan if it is attacked are potentially even more destabilizing."
<p>	"At stake is not only peace and security in the region, but the viability of democracy on Taiwan. Also, with a population of 21 million and trade with the United States totaling $47 billion per year, the ROC is the seventh-largest U.S. trading partner, right behind China itself," Fisher says.
<p>	"The United States cannot afford to let the situation in the Taiwan Strait deteriorate further without grave consequences for U.S. stature in Asia," he says. "The Clinton administration must make clear the United States will not tolerate an attack on Taiwan."

GOVERNMENT "SLUSH FUNDS," ANALYST SAYS</h2></center>

<P>
	WASHINGTON, MARCH 1, 1996</b> -- Congress should identify and eliminate a host of government programs that special-interest groups use to fund lobbying and political activities many taxpayers would not willingly support, a Heritage Foundation analyst said today.
<P>	 According to <a href="/heritage/staff/griffin.html">Charles Griffin</a>, deputy director of Heritage's Government  Reform Project, Congress' 1995 effort to stop what he calls "taxpayer-funded political slush funds" fell far short of what is needed to solve the problem. "Not only are many political lobbying groups still able to draw billions of taxpayer dollars into their coffers," Griffin says, "such groups also tend to be the strongest supporters of bigger government, more spending, and increased regulation -- which guarantee them continued funding."
<p>	Griffin identifies the <a href="/heritage/library/categories/govern/bg1069.html">top 10 government programs</a> that give taxpayer-funded grants to hundreds of special interests, which then use the money for political purposes. For example, by law, participants in AmeriCorps, President's Clinton's national service program, are barred from engaging in partisan political activities. Yet, in one reported instance, a nonprofit group, the Cole Coalition in Cole, Colo., used AmeriCorps volunteers to draft campaign fliers attacking a local politician and distribute them door-to-door. "We realized there was something politically partisan," said 21-year-old volunteer Joseph Taylor. "Although the Cole Coalition was stripped of its funding," Griffin says, "the AmeriCorps program lives on -- as does the potential for abuse." 
<p>	Another major violator, the Legal Services Corporation (LSC) -- funded at $400 million per year -- was originally established to provide legal services to the poor in civil and non-criminal matters. Griffin says the LSC uses its budget to funnel federal taxpayer dollars to 323 private groups around the country that use the money to fight legal battles having clear political objectives. "Through litigation, advocacy and lobbying, the LSC has helped to generate hundreds of billions of dollars in increased local, state and federal welfare spending and the addition of hundreds of millions of people to the welfare rolls," Griffin says. 
<p>	For example, LSC grantees have sued governments at all levels to stop welfare reform and have worked to prevent the eviction of drug dealers from public housing. "It's not that people don't have a right to engage in such activities," Griffin adds. "It's that they shouldn't be allowed to do so with the taxpayers' money."
<p>	 A third example from the top 10 list, the Department of Health and Human Services' Discretionary Aging Projects, is funded at $26 million per year. While the stated purpose of the project is to provide trained personnel and programs that improve the quality of life for the elderly, Griffin says the money in the program is often used to underwrite the activities of senior-oriented special-interest groups. 
<p>	"The National Council of Senior Citizens receives 96 percent of its budget from federal funds and is one of many such groups that promote government interventionism," Griffin says.  Other grantees benefiting from the program in 1994 included groups that actively opposed Medicare reform, such as the American Association of Retired Persons, Families USA, and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare.
<p>	Griffin says funneling millions of dollars in public subsidies to special interests to subsidize their political advocacy qualifies as a significant abuse of the public's money and the public trust. 
<p>	"If the situation were reversed and millions of taxpayer dollars were going to conservative activist groups, the response would be sheer outrage. Political orientation aside, Congress needs to put an end to this egregious abuse of taxpayer dollars," Griffin says.

TOUGHER RESPONSE TO CUBA</h2>
</center>

<p>


	WASHINGTON, FEB. 29, 1996</b> -- Calling economic sanctions against Cuba an insufficient response to the island nation's downing of two U.S. civilian aircraft, a Heritage Foundation analyst today outlined a series of <a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/fyi88.html">tough measures</a> the United States should take to further isolate Fidel Castro.
<p>
	"In addition to tightening economic sanctions against Cuba, the U.S. government should make it clear to Castro that any further violations of international law or unprovoked military attacks against American citizens will be countered with appropriate and decisive force," Heritage Latin American Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/sweeney.htm">John Sweeney</a> says in a new paper.
<p>	Specifically, Sweeney says the U.S. government should:
<p><ul>
	<li> Warn Cuba that the United States will enforce international law in the region.  Any attacks by Cuba against civilian aircraft or boats outside the 12-mile territorial limit established by international law should be met with a "prompt, immediate and proportional response by America's armed forces," he says.  U.S. warplanes should patrol the waters between Florida and Cuba to enable a rapid response.
<p>
<li> Ban the flow of all cash from the United States to Cuba, which props up the Castro regime with more than $500 million a year in hard currency.
	<p><li> Prohibit all visits to Cuba by U.S. citizens -- including journalists, academics and business people -- and ban travel to the United States by all Cubans until the Castro regime extends the same travel privileges to opposition leaders as it does to communist officials.
<P><li> Impose strict controls over the activities and movements of Cuban officials in the United States.  The Castro regime bans democratic and human rights groups from meeting freely in Cuba; the U.S. government should deny Cuban officials those same freedoms in the United States, expelling all violators.
<p><li>Warn Castro that the United States will view any attempt to spark a new refugee crisis as a hostile act against the national security of the United States.
<p><li> Use Radio Marti to inform Cubans that U.S. actions are aimed at Castro, not at them, to counter Castro's anti-American propaganda.
<p><li> Publicly oppose the activation in Cuba of a nuclear reactor based on an unsafe East German design, which would present a security threat to the Southeast United States.

<h2>AS BIG GOVERNMENT WITHERS, LEADING
THINKERS PONDER A REPLACEMENT</h2>
</center>




<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>


	WASHINGTON, FEB. 12, 1996</b> --  If the era of big government is over, as 
President Clinton proclaims, what will replace it? 
<p>
	Lots of things. In the <a href="/heritage/p_review/mar96/toc.html">latest issue</a> of 
<I>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</I>, 20 prominent thinkers and 
reformers describe private institutions they would like to see emerge over the next two decades 
to rebuild American community and culture in the wake of the welfare state. 
<p>	<a href="/heritage/p_review/mar96/symp.html"> Their suggestions</a> run the gamut 
from police-training programs for kids (proposed by New York City Police Commissioner 
William Bratton) to structured group homes for welfare mothers and their children (Myron 
Magnet, editor of the <I>City Journal</I>, New York City, and author of  "<I>The Dream and the 
Nightmare.</I>" Uniting the proposals is a common belief that reliance on Washington to solve 
society's problems has done more harm than good. American culture and society must be 
renewed the old-fashioned way: by private citizens working hands-on in their own communities.
<P>Not surprisingly, many of the suggestions concern improving America's government-run 
education system. Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman wants all parents to have the 
right -- and the financial ability -- to send their children to any school, public or private. William 
Galston, a former adviser to President Clinton who now teaches at the University of Maryland's 
School of Public Affairs, proposes a new funding system for charter schools, which are quasi-
public but free of much of the stifling bureaucracy that plagues the broader government school 
system.  
<p>	Two participants -- New York Lt. Gov. Elizabeth McCaughey Ross and Jim Pinkerton, 
former Bush administration official and author of "<I>What Comes Next: The End of Big 
Government - And the New Paradigm Ahead</I>" -- even proposed the same idea: a rating 
system for schools (Pinkerton envisions a <I>Consumer Reports</I> for education) that would 
empower parents with information on how money is being spent and how well students are 
performing on standardized tests.
<p>	But education reform is not enough. Bratton, for example, believes many kids need to 
learn respect for the law and law-enforcement officers. His dream of a structured police career 
path for kids -- summer "youth academies" and a police-oriented version of the Boy Scouts 
called Law Enforcement Explorers -- would give young people positive interactions with the 
police, deepen their respect for the law, and even guide some into police careers themselves.
<p>	Myron Magnet envisions group homes for welfare mothers and children where the focus 
is not on the job prospects of young women but on providing structured, caring environments for 
kids. He believes that by the time today's underclass children reach school, it's too late to give 
them the foundation in cognitive and moral skills they will need to succeed. That's what the 
group homes could do.
<p>	Higher education is ripe for some new ideas as well. Harvey Mansfield, professor of 
government at Harvard, longs for a "great books junior college" to give students the education 
they didn't receive in high school and won't receive in politically correct four-year institutions.  
And Michael Medved, chief film critic for the New York Post and author of "<I>Hollywood vs. 
America</I>," would go even further, creating an "elite" private university that would go back to 
teaching a classic liberals arts education and compete with the politically correct Ivy League 
schools. 
<p>	Other innovative ideas rounding out the list include: private science funding (perhaps by 
corporations) to reduce the scientific community's dependence on the federal government; 
private, non-profit job-training programs; effective homeless programs run by representatives 
from the religious and business communities; and even new television shows devoted to 
exposing government violations of citizens' rights and celebrating individuals who have 
overcome personal hardships.

IN EVERY STATE, STUDY SHOWS</h2></center>

<p>


	WASHINGTON, FEB. 9, 1996</b> -- Taxpayers in every state would send less of their income to Washington under a 17 percent flat tax, according to a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi86.html">new Heritage Foundation analysis</a>.
<p>	The average annual savings would range from a high of $1,856 per taxpaying household in Connecticut to a low of $318 in California, the study showed. And in 33 states, the average household would see its income-tax bill drop by more than $1,000 per year.
<p>	Nationwide, the 17 percent flat tax would reduce the average household's yearly federal tax bill by more than $1,100, a savings of 25 percent compared to the current system, said Heritage economists <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William Beach</a> and <a href="/heritage/staff/mitchell.htm">Daniel Mitchell</a>. Taxpayers in many states would save even more. In addition to Connecticut, the top 10 include: New Jersey ($1,521), Illinois ($1,511), North Dakota ($1,506), Virginia ($1,463), Indiana ($1,415), Rhode Island ($1,406), Washington ($1,385), Michigan ($1,372) and Florida ($1,335).
<p>
	With the campaign of GOP presidential candidate Steve Forbes built around the flat tax, tax reform has already emerged as a key 1996 election issue. House Majority Leader Richard Armey,  R-Texas, and Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., both have introduced bills that would replace the current tax code with a flat rate that taxes income only once. 
<p>	Contrary to claims that a flat tax might increase the tax burden on middle-income taxpayers, Beach and Mitchell found that "a properly designed flat tax would provide much-needed tax relief" for the average filer.  
<P>	Their analysis of the impact on taxpayers under the Armey-Shelby plan found that households in every state would see their tax bills drop not only in dollar terms, but in percentage terms as well. South Dakota taxpayers would benefit the most, with an average tax decrease of 38 percent. Other states would see big drops too, including North Dakota (33 percent), Indiana (31 percent) and Florida (30 percent).  
<p>	All told, a 17 percent tax rate on individual income would decrease federal tax payments by $125 billion, with the largest savings going to individual taxpayers in New York ($10 billion), Texas ($8 billion), Illinois ($8 billion) and Florida ($8 billion).
<p>	The Heritage analysts also examined the impact on taxpayers of a flat tax rate of 20 percent. At the higher rate, they found, the average tax bill would rise in two states. In California the average increase would be $417; in Montana: $9. In the rest of the states, even a 20 percent rate would result in a tax decrease for the average taxpayer; nationwide it would yield the average household a tax cut of more than $500. 
<p>	In addition, a flat tax of 20 percent -- which is the initial rate under the Armey-Shelby plan -- would be revenue neutral, adding nothing to the deficit. According to Beach and Mitchell, reductions in individual income taxes would be offset by increases in corporate taxes (in the belief that business income should be taxed only once, at the corporate rather than individual level).
<p>	To ensure accuracy, the Heritage analysis was based on actual tax records contained in the Internal Revenue Service Public Use File for 1991, the latest year for which data are available. The Public Use File is a statistically accurate sample (155,000 returns) of all individual income-tax returns for a given year.
<p>	"The evidence shows that those who say a flat tax would make Americans pay more haven't looked at the numbers," Beach says.

DEMISE, ANALYST SAYS</h2></center>

<p>

	WASHINGTON, FEB. 6, 1996</b> -- The NATO security alliance that protected Europe from Soviet attack during the Cold War is veering so far from its original mission that it may not survive, according to a defense expert at The Heritage Foundation.
<P>
	In a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/bg1067.html">paper</a> released today, Heritage Policy Analyst John Hillen says NATO's recent foray into "peacekeeping" in Bosnia -- a country not even part of the alliance -- is just the latest example of how NATO is losing sight of its original reason for existence: protecting Europe against domination by a hostile power or bloc of powers.
<P>
	"Who is to say whether Russia or some other country may or may not be a threat to Europe 10 or 20 years from now?" he asks. "It is not the immediacy of the threat that counts, but the depth of America's vital interest in the basic security of Europe."
<p>	To ensure NATO remains a bulwark against threats to Europe's security, Hillen recommends that Congress consider a "NATO Revitalization Act" that would do four things: explain to the American people why U.S. involvement in NATO is vital; define the U.S. role in the alliance as limited to deterring aggression; clarify when U.S. military force should be used; and call for the quick expansion of NATO to include the newly democratized Central European countries of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.	
<p>	The fact that Europe faces no immediate threat is no argument for expanding the alliance's role, Hillen says. After all, NATO is an insurance policy, designed to protect against catastrophe no matter how remote the threat might be. "It is far better to have 100,000 troops deployed peaceably now than have to commit a million troops later to fight a war," he says.
<p>	Besides, Hillen says, the United States is already involved in an organization designed to handle lower-level security tasks such as peacekeeping, and it is not NATO. The 54-member Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) monitors sanctions and leads observer missions in the former Yugoslavia and other countries. And while it is true that the OSCE has proven incompetent at dealing with problems like Bosnia, NATO nevertheless should not be thrust into missions for which it is poorly suited.
<p>	But once NATO decides to act, Hillen says, the U.S. role must be clearly defined to promote a sensible "division of labor" with America's allies. He says U.S. forces should be deployed only when they can make a unique contribution -- one no other country is able to make -- and when they can produce a decisive victory. In this way, America can ensure that its military role is limited to serving NATO's core mission of "collective defense" (protecting Europe against hostile domination) and not "collective security" (peacekeeping, nation-building and other humanitarian missions).
<p>	To drift from this core mission in search of new roles for NATO would not only create rifts between NATO members over whose troops should serve in peacekeeping operations, but would diminish support for NATO from an American public that questions why the United States should be the world's policeman.
<p>	By contrast, expanding NATO to include new democracies in Central Europe would strengthen the alliance and "bring a level of stability and security ... that the region has never enjoyed throughout its tortured history." The only obstacle to such expansion, he says, is the Clinton administration, which fears Russia opposition. 
<p>	"NATO needs to get back to basics," Hillen concludes. "In the absence of a clear and present danger to Europe it has lost its focus. ... A NATO Revitalization Act will refocus the alliance and preserve American support for the U.S. role in Europe."

	WASHINGTON, JAN. 30, 1996</b> -- The Clinton administration's plan to launch a "peacekeeping" mission to the Golan Heights once Israel and Syria reach a peace agreement would place both U.S. troops and Israel itself at considerable risk, according to a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/bg1066.html">new paper</a> by foreign-policy experts at <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>. 
<p>	A U.S. presence in the strategic buffer zone between Israel and Syria would be a double-edged sword, say Heritage Deputy Director of Foreign Policy and Defense Studies Thomas Moore and Senior Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/phillips.htm">James Phillips</a>.  Not only would U.S. troops face possible attacks from terrorist groups in the area, but Israel's ability to defend itself could be diminished. 
<p>	The analysts urge Congress to hold hearings immediately on the costs and benefits of embroiling the United States in a Golan peacekeeping mission.  They say U.S. negotiators trying to broker an agreement between the two countries should not promise foreign aid to Syria as an enticement to reach peace.  And even if a deal is reached, under no circumstances should American troops participate in a peacekeeping force.  "The United States cannot afford an open-ended deployment of first echelon combat troops in support of what is essentially a diplomatic gambit," they say.  
<p>	Moore and Phillips argue U.S. troops in the Golan Heights would be prime targets for terrorist groups based in nearby Lebanon, such as Hezbollah.  Just as Syria's strongman Hafez al-Assad supported Hezbollah's terrorist campaign against U.S. peacekeeping forces in Lebanon (the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut), so too might he pursue a similar strategy in the Golan to drive U.S. troops from the area. And even if Syria cooperates in restraining terrorism, the analysts say, nothing would prevent Iran, Iraq or Libya from sponsoring terrorism against U.S. troops on their own.
<p>	In addition, a U.S. presence on the Golan would effectively halt Israel's ability to respond with force to attacks from Lebanon-based terrorists or from Syria itself.  "Ironically, the U.S. presence could prove to be more of a deterrent to Israel than to Syria," the analysts say.  Since American forces on the Golan will be inadequate to defend Israel if it is attacked, "the real rationale for the U.S. presence is not military, but political -- to reassure a nervous Israeli public about security concerns that the United States will be in no position to remedy if conflict erupts," they say.
<P>	Moore and Phillips also say a U.S. presence in a Golan peacekeeping mission is not needed.  "Other countries are willing and able to contribute neutral peacekeeping forces," they note. Peacekeepers from Austria, Canada, Finland and Poland have been stationed on the Golan Heights for over two decades to monitor compliance with the 1974 Israeli-Syrian Disengagement Agreement, making U.S. participation in any future peacekeeping force unnecessary, they say.
<p>	But if U.S. troops are dispatched to the Golan, their situation would be far more precarious than that of the U.S. peacekeepers stationed along the Egyptian-Israeli border in the Sinai Peninsula.  In the Sinai, where U.S. troops have been since 1982, a broad desert separates two sides that are allies of the United States and at peace with each other.  In the Golan, U.S. troops would be confined to a much smaller area flanked by the large armored forces of two avowed enemies.
<p>	Any peacekeeping mission to the Golan also would divert critically needed  U.S. forces, the analysts say. A credible long-term Golan peacekeeping mission would likely require three brigades, or roughly 10 percent of the U.S. Army's active duty combat strength.  That is a "prohibitively high" burden for an open-ended peacekeeping mission, one that could place the United States in jeopardy if conflict arises in Korea, the Persian Gulf or any other place where vital U.S. national interests are at stake, Moore and Phillips say.
<p>	Citing these and other concerns, the analysts say congressional hearings are imperative. They note in both Haiti and Bosnia, swift action by the Clinton administration to send troops stifled congressional debate.  This time, Congress must address the peacekeeping issue before the negotiators reach a deal, or risk receiving another "diplomatic <i>fait accompli</i>" from the White House.
<p>	"The United States should not jeopardize important national security interests by committing U.S. troops to seal an Israeli-Syrian peace agreement that is potentially fragile and cosmetic," the analysts conclude.

<h2>RELIGIOUS PRACTICE CAN BE EFFECTIVE WEAPON AGAINST AMERICA'S SOCIAL ILLS, STUDY FINDS</h2></center>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations
<p>
	WASHINGTON, JAN. 25, 1996</b> -- As Washington policy-makers struggle to find solutions to America's major social problems, they should consider the enormous contribution religion can make toward solving them, according to a Heritage Foundation analyst.
<p>	In a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/family/bg1064.html">paper</a> released today, <a href="/heritage/staff/fagan.htm">Patrick Fagan</a>, an expert in family and social issues at Heritage, says nearly every major study on the impact of religion demonstrates its positive impact on a host of social problems. Religion, the majority of studies conclude, "is the resource that most powerfully addresses the major social problems confronting the nation," according to Fagan, the William H. G. FitzGerald fellow.
<p>	Fagan presents a summary of the social science literature, which reveals that religious practice strengthens the family and brings satisfaction to marriage; helps poor people move out of poverty; aids substantially in the formation of personal moral judgment; and inoculates individuals against such social problems such as suicide, drug abuse, out-of-wedlock births, crime and divorce. 
<p>	"Renowned historians and philosophers have always known that the character of a social order is, in large part, determined by its religious roots. Social science cannot prove that religion, or religion in any varying expressions, is true. But the professional literature of the modern social sciences has shown religious practice to have positive social consequences," Fagan says.
<p>	He cites "Middletown," a classic sociological research project that studied the lives of inhabitants of a typical American town, first in the 1920s and then again in the 1980s. The study  found that "church-going members were more likely to be married, remain married, and to be highly satisfied with their marriages." 
<p>	Another important study of strong families, conducted in the 1970s and 1980s by a pair of University of Nebraska professors, found that "84 percent of these families identified religion as an important contributor to the strength of their families." The same study also indicated that "parents who attended church frequently cited the significance of religion in rearing their children and in providing moral guidance."
<p>	Ongoing studies by Arizona State University West demonstrate that  religious belief and practice  encourage optimism among socially at-risk children. Among the findings: Students who attend church weekly or more frequently are more optimistic about their futures; have better relationships with their parents; are more likely to dismiss racism as an obstacle to reaching their goals; and are more likely to see themselves in control of their own futures, not as victims of oppression. 
<p>	Armed with such evidence about the positive benefits of religious practice, Fagan says it is time for policy-makers to stop ignoring the role religion plays in the welfare of the nation. "Given the growing crisis in out-of-wedlock births and their resultant effects, such as huge social and economic costs, this research should be of major interest to policy-makers," he says.
<p>	Fagan offers several steps that both Congress and the president can take to encourage religious practice. Among them:
<p><ul>
	<li> Congress should initiate a national discussion on the need to restore the  role of religion in American life. "The Senate used to be the chamber for debate on the great issues of the day. It should take up that role again and discuss the relationship between the practice of religion and the health of the nation,"  Fagan says. 
<p>
<li> Congress should pass a resolution affirming that census data on the extent of religious practice can also help inform the public debate on America's most difficult social problems.  Such a resolution would also remove the excuse that it is not permissible to fund research on the  religious aspect of American life. 
	<p>
<li> The president should appoint judges who are at least more sensitive to the role of religion in public life. Fagan says it weakens society and makes no sense to crowd religion out of every activity in which government is involved. "All future candidates for federal court appointments  should be asked to clarify their views regarding both the role of religion in politics and their understanding of the Founding Fathers' intent on this issue," Fagan says.  
</ul><p>	While the study discusses  the role the nation's policy-makers should play in encouraging religious practice, it also spells out actions that America's religious leaders and individual citizens can take.
<p>	Fagan says religious leaders must draw attention to the foundational role religion plays in supporting families and schools. He says religious individuals need to emphasize the need for religious training in adolescents who are most at risk of losing their anchoring in the community and turning to crime, drugs or other social ills.
<P>	"Social research demonstrates that regular religious practice is both an individual and social good. It offers a powerful answer to many of the nation's most serious social problems. The time is ripe for a deeper dialogue on the contribution of religion to the welfare of the nation," Fagan says.

<title>Russian Control of Oil-Rich Regions key to Chechen Conflict, Analyst Says -- Heritage PR</title>

<hr><h2>RUSSIAN CONTROL OF OIL-RICH REGIONS KEY
TO CHECHEN CONFLICT, ANALYST SAYS</h2>
</center>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations

<p>
	WASHINGTON, JAN. 23, 1996</b> -- Overlooked in the current conflict between Russia and the breakaway republic of Chechnya is the larger Russian goal of dominating the oil-rich states of the former Soviet Union, according to a new <a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/bg1065.html">Heritage Foundation paper</a>.  
<p>	The Chechen conflict is just one of many efforts by Russia to create a sphere of influence in the strategic regions of the Caucasus and Central Asia, says Heritage Senior Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/cohen.htm">Ariel Cohen</a>.  If Russia succeeds, he says, it could establish a monopoly over the region's vast oil supply (estimated at 25 million barrels, larger than reserves in Alaska's Northern Slope and the North Sea combined) and drive up energy prices across the globe.
<p>	The U.S. response, Cohen says, must be to ensure that all interested parties, including American oil companies, have free and fair access to the region's oil fields.  The United States can do this in a number of ways, principally by working to preserve the economic independence of former Soviet republics in the region -- such as Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Georgia -- and by opposing any efforts of the Russian military to control the oil fields and pipelines through force.
<p>	In a worst-case scenario, Cohen says, Moscow would grab full control of the oil fields, increasing Western energy dependence on a country that has not always been friendly toward the West.  Disturbingly, Russia is already setting up military bases in the region -- four in Georgia and three in Armenia -- to cement its control over all future oil pipelines built in the region.  Such a strategy has support in Russia not only from ultra-nationalists like Vladimir Zhirinovsky, but from the powerful military and "security services."  Cohen describes the intent of these factions bluntly: "The Russian army and security services seek to deny foreign companies the right to export oil without their control."  If Russia dominates this vital region, Cohen even sees the possibility of a Russian alliance with anti-Western regimes Iran, Iraq and Lybia to drive up the price of oil.  
<p>	Cohen says the challenge for the United States is to convince Russia that its national interest lies not in a confrontation with the West over oil, but in cooperation with the West to develop the economic potential of the oil-rich region.  The United States should reassure Moscow that Russian companies, which currently lack the resources to tap the oil, will nevertheless be included in any future ventures.  In this way, Cohen says, Russia will get the economic help it needs from the West, and the West will get the assurance of stability in the region.

<h2>POLICY REVIEW MAGAZINE WILL GREET 1996 
WITH NEW MISSION, FORMAT, FREQUENCY</h2></center><p>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>

<P>

	<b>WASHINGTON, DEC. 1, 1995</b> -- As Americans debate how to rebuild their communities in the wake of a receding federal government, one of conservatism's most influential voices is charting a new course for reinvigorating private-sector and local government alternatives to the centralized welfare state. The Heritage Foundation's flagship magazine, <i>Policy Review</i>, is redefining its mission to articulate and advance the conservative vision of "civil society."
<p>
	Beginning with the <a href="/heritage/p_review/jan96/toc75.html">January/February 1996</a> issue, the magazine, renamed <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i>, will feature new departments with a new design and appear six rather than four times a year. <a href="/heritage/staff/meyerson.htm">Adam Meyerson</a>, the magazine's editor for 12 years, plans to make <i>Policy Review</i> a clearinghouse of information and analysis about civic leaders who are solving America's most pressing social and cultural problems without relying on the federal government. "The central challenge for conservatives over the next 20 years is to restore the tradition of American citizenship by rebuilding the institutions of civil society -- families, neighborhoods, religious institutions, schools, civic associations, businesses, and local governments," Meyerson explains. 
<p>	The new format builds on one of the current magazine strengths: its long-time focus on stories that show the failures of big-government liberalism and illustrate the successes of private and local government initiative. "By becoming Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship, we are simply clarifying our mission, improving our product by building on what we already do best," says Heritage Foundation President and Policy Review Publisher <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin J. Feulner Jr</a>.
<p>	The magazine seeks to make clear the differences between the conservative and liberal conceptions of society. "Unlike liberals who are mostly uncomfortable with religion, conservatives see religious fervor as one of the most important engines of civil society," says Deputy Editor Joe Loconte. The new Policy Review will feature a regular department, "One Nation Under God," which will show the involvement of religious institutions in repairing America's social fabric.
<p>	Unlike liberals, conservatives also see business as an essential part of the citizenship movement. Frequently the most creative answers to social problems come from businesses that can profit by solving them. Another new department, called "The Blessings of Liberty," will show how economic freedom and marketplace competition contribute to civil society.
<p>	The new Policy Review will feature several other regular departments as well. "Home Front" will identify character-building organizations that promote responsible parenthood. "We the People" will tell about remarkable acts of generosity by ordinary people and community institutions. "Abuses and Usurpations" will show how federal and state executive agencies, legislatures, and courts are interfering with civil society by denying its institutions the freedom to make basic decisions. <a href="/heritage/p_review/jan96/tsquare.html">"Town Square"</a> will provide news about the best books, papers, and seminars that promote citizenship. And "Profiles in Citizenship" will look at Americans who have built great civic institutions in the past.
<p>	The January/February issue features a <a href="/heritage/p_review/jan96/preserv.html">symposium with presidential candidates</a> Robert Dole, Phil Gramm, Richard Lugar, Lamar Alexander, and Robert Dornan. Candidates respond to the question, "Which parts of the Constitution are commonly misinterpreted or underappreciated, and therefore deserve more emphasis in political discourse?" The answers are as varied as the candidates themselves: Dole on "The Establishment Clause"; Gramm on "The Takings Clause"; Lugar on "Enumerated Powers"; Alexander on "Presidential Powers"; and Dornan on "Government by Judiciary."
<p>	Also in this issue, former Attorney General and Heritage Ronald Reagan Fellow <a href="/heritage/staff/meese.htm">Edwin Meese III</a> and special counsel Rhett DeHart show "How Washington Subverts Your Local Sheriff" in their article about the bipartisan assault on local law enforcement. Meese and DeHart urge national lawmakers to resist the temptation to make ordinary crime a federal issue. They argue that nationalizing crime contradicts constitutional principles, incurs unnecessary expense, and does not allow for states to experiment with innovative approaches to the prevention of crime.
<p>	"Can Congress Revive Civil Society?" Yes, says Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind. Along with William J. Bennett, Coats has introduced the "Project for American Renewal" -- comprised of 19 separate bills designed to use public policy -- and public resources -- to energize mainly private efforts to meet human needs. In this article, Coats details his plan and Gertrude Himmelfarb, Don Eberly, and David Boaz offer their comments.
<p>	In "Clinton's AmeriCorps Values," John Walters of The New Citizenship Project says President Clinton's citizenship is defined  "with subsidies, centralized government, and self-esteem." While Clinton incorporates a message of personal responsibility and citizenship into his rhetoric, his vision is "deeply flawed," says Walters. The president has sought justify his efforts to expand the welfare state and to reinvigorate civic life by trying to re-legitimize government. Walters points to Clinton's AmeriCorps program, which uses federal resources to promote voluntarism and "contradicts the principle of self-government that lies at the heart of citizenship." Walters asserts that Americans should revitalize citizenship by getting the federal government out of the areas of public life that citizens can and should direct themselves. 
<p>	Articles by Florida's Jeb Bush, Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson, and others appear in the January/February issue as well.
<p>	 Policy Review began publishing in 1977 and now has a paid circulation of 30,000. It is indexed by the Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature, the Public Affairs Information Service, and the Social Sciences Index. The full text of the magazine is available on NEXIS and on the "Internet" at <a href="/heritage/">http://www.heritage.org</a>.
<p>	A one-year <a href="/heritage/p_review/subscribe.html">subscription</a> to the magazine costs $19.95; two-years costs $34.95. To subscribe, call 1-800-304-0056.

<P>
<I>&quot;The 'Index of Economic Freedom' provides an important
benchmark for evaluating Hong Kong's future success after it reverts
to Chinese control in 1997.&quot;</I>
-- Kim Holmes,
Vice President, The Heritage Foundation
<P>
 
<P>
 <B>WASHINGTON, Dec. 13, 1995</B> -- Hong Kong's economy has been
rated as the freest in the world by the prestigious American research
institute The Heritage Foundation. 
<P>
 The economies of just 10 other countries -- three from the Asia-Pacific
region -- also were rated as &quot;free&quot; in the Washington-based
think tank's annual &quot;Index of Economic Freedom.&quot; 
<P>
 Singapore was judged to have the second-freest economy in the
world. New Zealand tied for fourth place. And the Republic of
China on Taiwan tied for eighth. Japan, whose economy was in the
&quot;mostly free&quot; category, was 15th (tied with Austria).

<P>
 The economies of Australia, South Korea, Malaysia, Sri Lanka,
Western Samoa, Indonesia, and the Philippines also earned ratings
of &quot;mostly free.&quot; 
<P>
 The People's Republic of China (PRC), on the other hand, ranked
near the bottom, tied with Mauritania and the Congo for 121st
place. India's score was only slightly better, and earned India
a tie (with Armenia, Sierra Leone and Yemen) for 117th place.
 
<P>
<I><B>Government House Presentation</B></I>
<P>
 Heritage Foundation President Edwin Feulner Jr. will present
a copy of the book-length report, &quot;The Index of Economic
Freedom,&quot; to The Honorable Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor,
at ceremonies at Government House today.
<P>
 Kim Holmes, Ph.D., vice president and director of foreign-policy
studies at The Heritage Foundation, said the &quot;Index of Economic
Freedom&quot; would provide &quot;an important benchmark for evaluating
Hong Kong's future success after it reverts to Chinese control
in 1997.&quot;
<P>
 Hong Kong was characterized in the report as &quot;one of the
most accessible markets in the world,&quot; with &quot;very few&quot;
barriers to imports and &quot;virtually no barriers to foreign
investors.&quot; In addition, the authors wrote, &quot;The government
does not interfere in the marketplace; taxes are low and predictable;
government spending increases are closely linked to economic growth&quot;;
and regulations are &quot;applied uniformly and consistently.&quot;
<P>
<I><B>Overview</B></I>
<P>
 Overall, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bahrain, New Zealand, Switzerland,
the Netherlands and the United States received the best ratings
in the think tank's annual survey of economic freedom, while Iraq,
Cuba, Laos and North Korea received the worst scores. All told,
the economies of 65 countries were rated as &quot;free&quot; or
&quot;mostly free,&quot; while 77 economies earned ratings of
&quot;mostly unfree&quot; or &quot;repressed.&quot; In all, 142
countries were rated in the new 1996 &quot;Index,&quot; up from
101 in the previous edition.
<P>
 Each country was rated on 10 economic factors, including its
banking, foreign investment, monetary, tax, trade, and wage and
price policies, the size of its government sector, property rights,
regulatory restrictions, and black-market activity. Countries
were given ratings of one to five in each category, one being
the best, five the worst.
<P>
 The United States stood in seventh place in the new 1996 edition
of the &quot;Index.&quot; Japan was 15th, tied with Austria. Among
former communist countries, the Czech Republic did the best by

 Several countries showed significant improvement from a year

several others -- including Brazil, Mexico, Italy and Zimbabwe
-- moved in the wrong direction, according to authors Bryan T.
Johnson and Thomas P. Sheehy.

 First published last year to provide the U.S. Congress with guidance
on foreign- aid reform, the first edition of the &quot;Index of
Economic Freedom&quot; also was widely praised by the international
investment community. Washington Post economics columnist James
T. Glassman  (Dec. 11, 1994) said the book provided &quot;useful
clues for investors who want to buy foreign stocks but can't decide
which countries are the most promising.&quot; Global Investment<I>
</I>magazine (June 1995) said the &quot;Index&quot; offered &quot;some
surprising insights on why some markets may be chained to the
ground while others are set for takeoff.&quot; And Journal of

to be drawn from this survey is clear. The more economic freedom
people are allowed, the less interference there is from government,

<P>
 Kim Holmes, vice president of The Heritage Foundation, said,
&quot;The evidence is incontrovertable: Economic freedom produces
economic prosperity. No amount of American aid can alter this
basic formula.&quot;
<P>
 In a new chapter on using the &quot;Index&quot; as an investment
tool, the authors applied nine additional investment factors to
those countries whose scores on the Heritage &quot;Index&quot;
had improved the most. Of the 24 countries to which the second
set of criteria were applied, Botswana, Indonesia, Israel, Panama
and Portugal scored best. While some of the 24 countries still
are considered economically unfree, all of them, the authors note,
&quot;deserve the close attention of the international investor
because they are liberalizing their economies (hence their improved
'Index' scores) and building foundations for strong economic growth,
an environment in which most investments do well.&quot;
<P>
 The second edition of the &quot;Index&quot; also confirmed a
trend noted in the first edition -- that &quot;wealthy and economically
free countries tend over time to reintroduce restrictions on economic
freedom. As they become wealthy, countries begin adding welfare
and other social programs that were not affordable when they were
poorer. Thus, after they become economically 'liberated,' countries
like Germany, Sweden and even the United States tend to fall back
down the scale of economic freedom, getting worse scores than
newly emerging free economies like Hong Kong or Singapore.&quot;
<P>
 Thus, &quot;economic freedom can rise and fall and the seeds
of destruction can exist in the fruits of success.&quot; 
<P>
<I><B>Highlights</B></I>
<P>
 The 1996 &quot;Index of Economic Freedom&quot; provides plenty
of food for thought, the authors noted. For example,
<P>
 <B>Asia:</B>
<P><ul>
<li>Despite the enthusiasm of the investment community, Vietnam
continues to have one of the world's most repressed economies.
<P>
<li>Japan scored worse this year, moving from the free to &quot;mostly
free&quot; category, largely as a result of increased banking
regulations.
<P>
<li>India's score likewise declined, largely as a result of its
moves against some foreign investment and continued use of price
controls.
</ul>
<P>
 <B>Europe:</B>
<P><ul>
<li>Europe's freest economies are found in Switzerland, the Netherlands,
Denmark and Luxembourg, rather than the United Kingdom, Germany
or France. With superior banking laws, the economies of Switzerland
and the Netherlands both were rated as more free than that of
the United States.
</ul>
<P>
 <B>Latin America &amp; the Caribbean</B>
<P><ul>
<li>The Bahamas had the freest economy in the region and the 12th
freest in the world (tied with Canada and the Czech Republic).
It would have scored even better if not for trade restrictions.
<P>
<li>One of the true bright spots was Panama, which jumped ahead
of Chile in the 1996 rankings, making it the Latin American country
with the freest economy. Chile did not backslide; its overall
average also improved from 1995 to 1996. It's just that Panama's
improved even more, largely because Panama depoliticized its money
supply, abolishing its central bank and federal-reserve system
and adopting the U.S. dollar as its official currency. As a result,
the Panamanian government can no longer print money for political
purposes, causing inflation.
<P>
<li>Despite media reports about economic reform in Cuba, the authors
found little to cheer about, ranking Cuba's economy as the most
repressed in Latin America and one of the three most repressed
in the world.
</ul>
<P>
 <B>Africa/Middle East:</B>

<ul>
<li>Ten countries in Northern Africa and the Middle East -- Bahrain,
United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Oman,
Israel, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon -- earned rankings of economically
free or &quot;mostly free.&quot; Just five countries in sub-Saharan
Africa earned such ratings: Botswana, Uganda, Swaziland, Benin
and Zambia.
<P>
<li>While some countries have liberalized their economies  -- Botswana's
score, for example, improved from 3.05 in 1995 to 2.8 in 1996
-- sub-Saharan Africa remains the most economically unfree &quot;and
by far the poorest&quot; region of the world. Indeed, of the 16
countries categorized as &quot;repressed&quot; in the 1996 &quot;Index,&quot;
six were in Africa.

<I>&quot;The evidence is incontrovertable: Economic
freedom produces economic prosperity. No
amount of American aid can alter this basic formula.&quot;</I>
-- Kim Holmes,
Vice President, The Heritage Foundation
<P>

<P>
 <B>WASHINGTON, DEC. 13, 1995</B> -- Just 10 other countries around
the world provide businesses and individuals with a degree of
economic freedom similar to America's, The Heritage Foundation
reported today in its annual survey of global economic freedom.
The economies of 142 countries were rated, up from 101 countries
a year ago.
<P>
 Hong Kong, Singapore, Bahrain, New Zealand, Switzerland, the
Netherlands and the United States received the best ratings on
Heritage's annual &quot;Index of Economic Freedom,&quot; while
Cuba, Iraq, Laos and North Korea received the worst scores. All
told, the economies of 65 countries were rated as &quot;free&quot;
or &quot;mostly free,&quot; while 77 economies earned ratings
of &quot;mostly unfree&quot; or &quot;repressed.&quot; Each country
was rated on 10 economic factors: banking, foreign investment,
monetary, tax, trade, and wage and price policies, the size of
its government sector, property rights, regulatory restrictions,
and black- market activity. Countries were given ratings of one
to five in each category, one being the best, five the worst.
<P>
 The United States ranked seventh overall on the report card,
just behind the Netherlands and just ahead of Denmark, Luxembourg,
the Republic of China (Taiwan), and the United Kingdom, which
tied for eighth place. Japan ranked 15th, tied with Austria. The
Czech Republic, in 12th place, remained far ahead of any other
former communist country. Estonia, which came the closest to the
Czech Republic, ranked 26th. 
<P>
 Several countries showed significant improvement from a year
ago, including Panama, Peru, Poland, Botswana and Indonesia, while
several others -- including Brazil, Mexico, Italy and Zimbabwe
-- moved in the wrong direction, according to authors Bryan T.
Johnson and Thomas P. Sheehy.

<P>
 In a new chapter on using the &quot;Index&quot; as an investment

including political stability, market size, external debt, infrastructure,
currency convertibility, and domestic savings -- to those countries
whose scores on the Heritage &quot;Index&quot; had improved most
during the past year. Of the 24 countries to which the second
set of criteria were applied, Botswana, Indonesia, Israel, Panama
and Portugal scored best. While some of the 24 countries still

<P>
<I><B>Foreign-Aid Reform</B></I>
<P>
 The 1995 &quot;Index&quot; was used extensively earlier this
year when Congress debated foreign-aid reform. The House and Senate
both included language in the &quot;foreign operations&quot; appropriations
bill requiring the Agency for International Development (AID)
to report to Congress annually on the relative economic freedom
and prosperity of countries receiving U.S. foreign aid.  
<P>

<P>
<I>&quot;Economic assistance  is wasted when it is given to
countries without free economies -- and it is unnecessary for countries with free economies.&quot;-- </i>Co-authors Bryan T. Johnson and Thomas P. Sheehy
<P>
<P>
Johnson and Sheehy, co-authors of the Heritage Foundation
volume, maintain that &quot;economic assistance is wasted when
it is given to countries without free economies -- and it is unnecessary,
as the 'Index' clearly shows, for countries with free economies.
For U.S. taxpayers and the recipients of economic aid alike, such
'assistance' is a no-win proposition.&quot;
<P>
 The United States has provided an estimated $270 billion in economic
development assistance since 1946. The recipients of the largest
amounts of aid, in addition to Israel and Egypt -- which, for
geopolitical reasons, receive a combined $5 billion per year --
are almost all countries with unfree economies.
<P>
 &quot;Most economic development aid is wasted; it is money down
the drain. It doesn't help the recipient country and it certainly
doesn't help U.S. taxpayers,&quot; Holmes said.
<P>
 &quot;The people of Angola, Mozambique, Haiti, Cuba and Ukraine
are not poor because the people in the West don't share their
riches. They are poor because their governments pursue destructive
economic policies that discourage free enterprise and the creation
of wealth. 
<P>
 &quot;Only when poor countries increase the economic freedom
of their citizens and unleash the phenomenal power of the free
market,&quot; the Heritage Foundation vice president said, &quot;will
true prosperity come to the poor nations of the world. Anything
short of this is not only economically unwise, but is cynically
cruel.&quot;

<P><P>
 <B>WASHINGTON, DEC. 13, 1995</B> -- The economies of 13 countries
in Latin America and the Caribbean received ratings of &quot;mostly
free&quot; in The Heritage Foundation's annual survey of global
economic freedom, released here today.
<P>
 Just 11 countries in the world received ratings of &quot;free,&quot;
none in Central America, South America, or the Caribbean.
<P>
 The Bahamas, Panama, Chile, El Salvador and Trinidad and Tobago
received the best ratings in the region on the influential think
tank's annual &quot;Index of Economic Freedom.&quot; Haiti and
Cuba received the worst ratings, the only two economies in the
region characterized as &quot;repressed.&quot;
<P>
 Globally, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bahrain, Switzerland, New Zealand,
the Netherlands and the United States received the best ratings
on the &quot;Index of Economic Freedom,&quot; while Iraq, Cuba,
Laos and North Korea received the worst scores. All told, the
economies of 65 countries were rated as &quot;free&quot; or &quot;mostly
free,&quot; while 77 economies earned ratings of &quot;mostly
unfree&quot; or &quot;repressed.&quot; 
<P>
 Each country was rated on 10 economic factors, including its
banking, foreign investment, monetary, tax, trade, and wage and
price policies, the size of its government sector, property rights,
regulatory restrictions, and black-market activity. Countries
were given ratings of one to five in each category, one being
the best, five the worst.
<P>
 The United States ranked seventh overall on the report card,
just behind the Netherlands, and just ahead of Denmark, Luxembourg,
the Republic of China (Taiwan), and the United Kingdom, which
tied for eighth place. Among the former communist countries, the
Czech Republic received the best score and was ranked 12th overall
(tied with the Bahamas and Canada). 
<P>
 Several countries showed significant improvement from a year
ago, including Panama and Peru, while several others -- including
Brazil and Mexico -- moved in the wrong direction, according to
authors Bryan T. Johnson and Thomas P. Sheehy.
<P>
<I><B>Regional Data</B></I>
<P>
 The Bahamas' economy earned a score of 2.0, putting it just over
the line separating the countries with totally free (a score of
1.0 to 1.99) and &quot;mostly free&quot; economies (2.0 to 2.99).
Panama earned a score of 2.4. Chile and El Salvador scored 2.45.
And Trinidad and Tobago scored 2.5. 
<P>
 Other countries in Latin America and the Caribbean whose economies
were rated as &quot;mostly free&quot; were Argentina (2.65), Paraguay
(2.65), Belize (2.7), Jamaica (2.7), Bolivia (2.75), Costa Rica
(2.8), Uruguay (2.8), and Guatemala (2.85). 
<P>
 Countries whose economies earned ratings of &quot;mostly unfree&quot;
(3.0 to 3.99) were Barbados (3.0), Colombia (3.0), Peru (3.0),
Ecuador (3.15), Honduras (3.15), Mexico (3.35), Guyana (3.4),
Brazil (3.45), Dominican Republic (3.45), Venezuela (3.5), and
Nicaragua (3.6). Haiti (4.2) and Cuba (5.0) were the only two
countries in the region whose economies were characterized as
&quot;repressed.&quot;

<I><B>Foreign-Aid Reform</B></I>
<P>
 The 1995 &quot;Index&quot; was used extensively earlier this
year when the United States Congress considered changes in the
U.S. foreign-aid program. One major change will require the U.S.
Agency for International Development (AID) to report annually
to Congress on the relative economic freedom of countries receiving
U.S. foreign aid.
<P>
Bryan Johnson and Thomas Sheehy, authors of the Heritage
Foundation volume, maintain that &quot;economic aid is wasted

is unnecessary, as the 'Index' clearly shows, for countries with
free economies. For U.S. taxpayers and the recipients of foreign
aid alike, economic aid is a no-win proposition.&quot;
<P>
 The United States has provided some $270 billion in economic
development assistance since 1946. &quot;Most economic assistance
is wasted. It doesn't help the recipient country and it certainly
doesn't help U.S. taxpayers,&quot; said Holmes, a highly regarded
foreign-policy specialist.

moves against foreign investment and its continued reliance on
price controls.
</ul><P>
 <B>Africa/Middle East:</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Ten countries in Northern Africa and the Middle East -- Bahrain,
United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Oman,
Israel, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon -- earned rankings of economically
free or &quot;mostly free.&quot; Just five countries in sub-Saharan

<P>
<li>While some countries have liberalized their economies  -- Botswana's
score, for example, improved from 3.05 in 1995 to 2.8 in 1996

by far the poorest&quot; region of the world. Indeed, of the 16
countries categorized as &quot;repressed&quot; in the 1996 &quot;Index,&quot;
six were in Africa.

 <B>WASHINGTON, DEC. 13, 1995</B> -- The economies of just five
countries in sub-Saharan Africa received ratings of &quot;mostly
free&quot; in The Heritage Foundation's annual survey of global
economic freedom, released here today. Of the 11 countries in the
world with ratings of &quot;free,&quot; none was in sub-Saharan
Africa.
<P>
 Botswana, Uganda, Swaziland, Benin and Zambia received the best
ratings in the region on the influential think tank's annual &quot;Index
of Economic Freedom.&quot; Mozambique, Sudan, Zaire, Angola and
Somalia received the worst ratings, with their economies characterized
as &quot;repressed.&quot;
<P>
 As a result of its economic-liberalization policies, Botswana
was identified as one of a handful of countries around the world
that stood out as a possible future investment prospect.
<P>
 Globally, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bahrain, Switzerland, New Zealand,
the Netherlands and the United States received the best ratings
on the &quot;Index of Economic Freedom,&quot; while Iraq, Cuba,
Laos and North Korea received the worst scores. 
<P>
 All told, the economies of 65 countries were rated as &quot;free&quot;
or &quot;mostly free,&quot; while 77 economies earned ratings
of &quot;mostly unfree&quot; or &quot;repressed.&quot; 
<P>
 In sub-Saharan Africa, five countries received &quot;mostly free&quot;
ratings, 23 received ratings of &quot;mostly unfree,&quot; and
five received ratings of &quot;repressed.&quot;
<P>
 Each country was rated on 10 economic factors, including its
banking, foreign investment, monetary, tax, trade, and wage and
price policies, the size of its government sector, property rights,
regulatory restrictions, and black-market activity. Countries
were given ratings of one to five in each category, one being
the best, five the worst.
<P>
 The United States ranked seventh overall on the report card,
just behind the Netherlands, and just ahead of Denmark, Luxembourg,
the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the United Kingdom, which tied
for eighth place. 
<P>
 Among the former communist countries, the Czech Republic received
the best score and was ranked 12th overall, tied with the Bahamas
and Canada. Like the Bahamas, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago
also received ratings of &quot;mostly free.&quot; 
<P>
 Several countries showed significant improvement from a year
ago, including Panama and Peru, while several others -- including
Brazil and Mexico -- moved in the wrong direction, according to
authors Bryan T. Johnson and Thomas P. Sheehy.
<P>
 Sub-Saharan Africa 
<P>
 The economy of Botswana earned a score of 2.8, the best in the
region and 47th overall (tied with Costa Rica). Other African
countries with &quot;mostly free&quot; economies (2.0 to 2.99)
included Uganda (2.83), Swaziland (2.9), Benin (2.95) and Zambia
(2.95). 
<P>
 Countries whose economies earned ratings of &quot;mostly unfree&quot;
(3.0 to 3.99) were South Africa (3.0), Kenya (3.05), Gabon (3.06),
Mali (3.1), Ghana (3.2), Ivory Coast (3.25), Nigeria (3.25), Guinea
(3.35), Madagascar (3.35), Malawai (3.4), Senegal (3.4), Cape
Verde (3.44), Tanzania (3.45), Cameroon (3.6), Ethiopia (3.6),
Lesotho (3.65), Burkina Faso (3.7), Niger (3.7), Zimbabwe (3.7),
Sierra Leone (3.75), Congo (3.8), Mauritania (3.8) and Suriname
(3.9).  
<P>
 Points to Hong Kong 
<P>
 Kim Holmes, Ph. D., vice president and director of foreign-policy
studies at The Heritage Foundation, said, &quot;The evidence is
incontrovertable: Economic freedom produces economic prosperity.
No amount of American aid can alter this basic formula.&quot;
<P>
 In a Nov. 27 speech in Hong Kong, Holmes pointed out that 30
years ago Hong Kong and Gabon were equally poor countries, with
per-capita incomes of $2,279 per year and $2,770 respectively.
Hong Kong then pursued a bold economic liberalization program,
while Gabon's government pursued the opposite course. Today, the
average per capita income in Hong Kong is $10,223. The average
in Gabon: just $3,502.
<P>
 &quot;Hong Kong's economic miracle should provide a lesson to
the less-developed world,&quot; Holmes said. &quot;You don't need
gold and silver deposits, or oil wells, or rich, arable land,
or American foreign aid to create wealth and prosperity. All you
need is a climate of economic freedom.&quot;
<P>
 Resource for Investors 
<P>
 In a new chapter on using the &quot;Index of Economic Freedom&quot;
as an investment tool, the authors applied nine additional investment
factors to those countries whose scores on the Heritage &quot;Index&quot;
had improved the most. Of the 24 countries to which the second
set of criteria were applied, Botswana, Indonesia, Israel, Panama
and Portugal scored the best. While some of the 24 countries are
rated as economically unfree, all of them, the authors note, &quot;deserve
the close attention of the international investor because they
are liberalizing their economies (hence their improved 'Index'
scores) and building foundations for strong economic growth, an
environment in which most investments do well.&quot;
<P>
 Foreign-Aid Reform 
<P>
 The 1995 &quot;Index&quot; was used extensively earlier this
year when the United States Congress considered changes in the
U.S. foreign-aid program. One major change will require the U.S.
Agency for International Development (AID) to report annually
to Congress on the relative economic freedom of countries receiving
U.S. foreign aid.
 <i>&quot;The evidence is incontrovertable: Economic 
freedom produces economic prosperity. No 
amount of American aid can alter this basic formula.&quot;</i> 
-- Kim Holmes, Vice President, The Heritage Foundation 
<P>
Bryan Johnson and Thomas Sheehy, authors of the Heritage Foundation
volume, maintain that &quot;economic aid is wasted when it is
given to countries without free economies -- and it is unnecessary,
as the 'Index' clearly shows, for countries with free economies.
For U.S. taxpayers and the recipients of foreign aid alike, economic
aid is a no-win proposition.&quot;
<P>
 The United States has provided some $270 billion in economic
development assistance since 1946. &quot;Most economic development
assistance is wasted. It doesn't help the recipient country and
it certainly doesn't help U.S. taxpayers,&quot; said Holmes, a
highly regarded foreign-policy specialist.
<P>
 &quot;The people of Angola, Mozambique, Haiti and Cuba  are not
poor because the people in the West don't share their riches.
They are poor because their governments pursue destructive economic
policies that discourage free enterprise and the creation of wealth,&quot;
Holmes said. &quot;Only when poor countries increase the economic
freedom of their citizens and unleash the phenomenal power of
the free market,&quot; the Heritage Foundation vice president
said, &quot;will true prosperity come to the poor nations of the
world. Anything short of this is not only economically unwise,
but is cynically cruel.&quot;
<P>
 Highlights 
<P>
 The authors of the Heritage Foundation  report made a number
of important observations. They found, for example:
<P>
 <B>Africa/Middle East:</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Ten countries in Northern Africa and the Middle East -- Bahrain,
United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Oman,
Israel, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon -- earned rankings of economically
free or &quot;mostly free.&quot; Just five countries in sub-Saharan
Africa earned such ratings: Botswana, Uganda, Swaziland, Benin
and Zambia.
<P>
<li>While some countries have liberalized their economies  -- Botswana's
score, for example, improved from 3.05 in 1995 to 2.8 in 1996
-- sub-Saharan Africa remains the most economically unfree &quot;and
by far the poorest&quot; region of the world. Indeed, of the 16
countries categorized as &quot;repressed&quot; in the 1996 &quot;Index,&quot;
six were in Africa.
</ul><P>
 <B>Latin America &amp; the Caribbean</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>The Bahamas had the freest economy in the region and the 12th
freest in the world (tied with Canada and the Czech Republic).
It would have scored even better if not for trade restrictions.
<P>
<li>One of the true bright spots was Panama, which jumped ahead
of Chile in the 1996 rankings, making it the Latin American country
with the freest economy. Chile did not backslide, however; its
overall average also improved from 1995 to 1996. It's just that
Panama's improved even more, largely because Panama depoliticized
its money supply, abolishing its central bank and federal-reserve
system and adopting the U.S. dollar as its official currency.
As a result, the Panamanian government can no longer print money
for political purposes, causing inflation.
<P>
<li>Despite media reports about economic reform in Cuba, the authors
found little to cheer about, ranking Cuba's economy as the most
repressed in the Latin America/Caribbean region and one of the
three most repressed in the world.
</ul><P>
 <B>Asia:</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Despite the enthusiasm of the investment community, Vietnam
continues to have one of the world's most repressed economies.
<P>
<li>Japan scored worse this year, moving from the free to &quot;mostly
free&quot; category, largely as a result of increased banking
regulations.
<P>
<li>India's score likewise declined, largely as a result of its
moves against foreign investment and its continued reliance on
price controls.

<title>Clinton's Family Tax Cut Denies Tax Relief to 23 Million Children -- Heritage</title></head>

<h2>CLINTON'S FAMILY TAX CUT DENIES TAX RELIEF TO 23 MILLION CHILDREN</h2></center><p>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations</b>

<P>


<P>
<b>WASHINGTON, DEC. 11, 1995 --</b> President Clinton's budget plan,
released last week, would give much less tax relief to low-income
working families than the congressional plan he recently vetoed,
according to an analysis by The Heritage Foundation. This finding
directly contradicts the president's claim that his budget would
be better for these families.         
<P>
Overall, Clinton's tax credit denies any tax relief to 10.4 million
working families that would receive relief under the plan he vetoed,
according to Scott Hodge, Grover M. Hermann fellow in federal
budgetary affairs. In other families, some children wouldn't qualify
for tax relief under Clinton's plan, but would qualify under Congress'
plan. 
<P>
Taken together, the Clinton plan would deny $15 billion in tax
relief to 23 million children who would qualify for it under Congress'
$500-per-child tax-credit plan.
<P>
Particularly hard hit are lower-income working families. In order
to claim the  Clinton tax cut, low-income families must first
reduce their tax bills by the amount of their Earned Income Tax
Credit (EITC) subsidy. Thus, 5.4 million families earning less
than $30,000 would be denied tax relief under Clinton's plan;
they would get $2.3 billion in tax relief under the plan he vetoed.
A typical single parent with one child, earning below $30,000,
would receive almost $200 less in tax relief each year under the
Clinton plan.
<P>
In addition, Clinton's $300-per-child tax credit does not apply
to children more than 12 years of age. Since roughly 25 percent
of all children are more than age 12, millions of families will
be denied a tax cut just when the cost of raising a child becomes
most expensive. This provision alone denies tax relief to families
of at least 2.8 million children earning less than $30,000 per
year. In fact, the average tax cut per family under the Clinton
plan is $442, the average tax cut under Congress' plan is $856
per family.
<P>
&quot;This is bait-and-switch tax policy,&quot; says Hodge. &quot;Clinton
says he is helping lower-wage families with children more than
Congress is, but that is absolutely untrue. The fine print in
his plan denies tax relief to millions of families who are being
told by the White House that they qualify.&quot;

<h2>CAPITAL
GAINS TAX CUT WOULD BENEFIT LOWER, MIDDLE CLASS MOST, HERITAGE
STUDY FINDS</h2></center><p>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations</b>

<P>
<b>WASHINGTON, DEC. 6, 1995 --</b> Contrary to what opponents
say, the benefits of cutting the capital gains tax rate -- as
proposed in Congress' Balanced Budget Act of 1995 --would go mostly
to lower- and middle-income taxpayers, a Heritage Foundation analyst
said today. 
<P>&quot;The typical household declaring a capital gain
had income from sources other than capital gains of $58,729 and
realized a gain of about $973,&quot; according to William Beach,
a visiting fellow in tax analysis at Heritage. &quot;This is hardly
what anyone would consider 'rich,'&quot; he says. In fact, Beach
says, more than 50 percent of the benefits from cutting the capital
gains tax would go not to the wealthy, but to lower- and middle-income
taxpayers. 
<P>Beach's findings are based on an analysis of 1991 tax
returns -- the most recent, detailed data available from the Internal
Revenue Service. 
<P>The Balanced Budget Act of 1995 would permit
individual taxpayers to exclude 50 percent of their capital gains
from taxation. That exclusion effectively cuts the tax rate on
capital gains in half. 
<P>For corporations, the act decreases the
capital gains rate from a maximum of 35 percent to 28 percent.
  Furthermore, Beach says when critics claim that capital gains
go mainly to the wealthy, they often mislead the public by including
the gain as part of a person's income. For example, a retiree
living on a $12,000 Social Security check who realizes a $30,000
capital gain one year from selling his house is classified &quot;as
a person with a $42,000 income who received a capital gain.&quot;
&quot;This sleight of hand allows opponents to 'fudge' the number
of rich in their favor,&quot; Beach says. 
<P>According to Beach,
a balanced budget and a lower capital gains tax rate will stimulate
economic growth, improve the fairness of the tax code and increase
federal revenue by encouraging individuals to take gains they
might not otherwise take because of a high tax rate. He points
to the University of Michigan's Quarterly Model -- one  of the
nation's most independent and respected models of the U.S. economy
-- which found that balancing the budget with tax cuts would produce
immediate reductions in interest rates and inflation and an upswing
in long-term economic activity. 
<P>Other leading private economic
firms (Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates, DRI/McGraw-Hill
and others) predicted that balancing the budget and cutting taxes
would lead to a much stronger economy with higher wages and more
spendable household income. &quot;This, more than any other factor,
helps poor and middle-class Americans,&quot; Beach points out.
<P>The Heritage Foundation recently used the U.S. Macroeconomic Model
developed and maintained by Laurence H. Meyer and Associates to
analyze the impact of a balanced budget plan. The model found
that over a seven-year period (1996-2002), most of the economic
benefits of the plan disappear without cuts in capital gains taxes.
The model predicted a loss of more than $80.2 billion in potential
gross domestic product, higher unemployment rates and slower household
income growth if the capital gains tax rate remains the same.
<P> Finally, Beach says that experience over the past 25 years shows
that rate decreases lead to more declarations of capital gains
and therefore more revenue from capital gains taxes. &quot;Owners
of appreciated assets who face high tax rates generally hold on
to their assets in anticipation of lower future rates. When the
rates come down, the amount of capital gains goes up,&quot; he
says. &quot;In other words, you can lower the rate and increase
revenue,&quot; Beach says. 
<P>Economists estimate that Americans
are holding trillions of dollars in unrealized capital gains.
&quot;Lowering the capital gains rate could produce substantial
economic benefits and create  revenue windfalls for federal and
state governments as well as average Americans,&quot; Beach says.

<h2>SINGAPORE ONE OF JUST 11 COUNTRIES WITH FREE ECONOMIES, SAYS 1996 &quot;INDEX OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM&quot;</h2>
<i>Ranks Second Overall, Ahead of U.S., Britain, Japan</i>

<P>




 <B>SINGAPORE, DEC. 4, 1995</B> -- Singapore has the second-freest
economy in the world, the prestigious American research institute,
The Heritage Foundation, reported today in its annual survey of
global economic freedom.
<P>
 Singapore &quot;has made remarkable [economic] progress by maintaining
an open trade and investment environment; a corruption-free, pro-business
regulatory system; political stability; an efficient, strike-free
labor force and tax incentives for foreign investors,&quot; the
report said. Singapore's &quot;average tariff rate is nearly nonexistent,&quot;
it maintains &quot;no import quotas and non-tariff barriers to
foreign trade&quot; and investment laws &quot;are clear and fair
and pose few problems for businesses.&quot; 
<P>
 Just 10 other countries around the world provide businesses and
individuals with a degree of economic freedom similar to Singapore's,
the Washington-based think tank said in its 1996 &quot;Index of
Economic Freedom.&quot; 
<P>
 The report was released Nov. 27 in Hong Kong. It was presented
to leaders of Singapore's business community at a luncheon today
at Traders Hotel. 
<P>
<I><B>Overview</B></I>
<P>
 Overall, Hong Kong, Singapore, Bahrain, New Zealand, Switzerland,
the Netherlands and the United States received the best ratings
on the annual &quot;Index of Economic Freedom,&quot; while Iraq,
Cuba, Laos and North Korea received the worst scores. The economies
of 65 countries were rated as &quot;free&quot; or &quot;mostly
free,&quot; while 77 economies earned ratings of &quot;mostly
unfree&quot; or &quot;repressed.&quot; 
<P>
 Each country was rated on 10 economic factors, including its
banking, foreign investment, monetary, tax, trade, and wage and
price policies, the size of its government sector, property rights,
regulatory restrictions, and black-market activity. Countries
were given ratings of one to five in each category, one being
the best, five the worst.
<P>
 The United States ranked seventh overall on the report card,
just behind Switzerland, and just ahead of Denmark, Luxembourg,
the Republic of China (Taiwan), and the United Kingdom, which
tied for eighth place. 
<P>
 Japan was 15th, tied with Austria. Among former communist countries,
the Czech Republic scored the best: in 12th place (tied with the
Bahamas and Canada).
<P>
 In addition to Japan, other Asian and Pacific Basin countries
whose economies received ratings of &quot;mostly free&quot; were
 Australia, the Republic of Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Sri Lanka,
Western Samoa, Indonesia and the Philippines.
<P>
 In all, 142 countries were rated in the new 1996 edition, compared
to 101 countries in the previous edition. 
<P>
 Several countries showed significant improvement from a year
ago, including Panama, Peru, Poland, Botswana and Indonesia, while
several others -- including Brazil, Mexico, Italy and Zimbabwe
-- moved in the wrong direction, according to authors Bryan T.
Johnson and Thomas P. Sheehy.

<P>
 First published last year to provide the U.S. Congress with guidance
on foreign- aid reform, the first edition of the &quot;Index of
Economic Freedom&quot; also was widely praised by the international
investment community. Washington Post economics columnist James
T. Glassman  (Dec. 11, 1994) said the book provided &quot;useful
clues for investors who want to buy foreign stocks but can't decide
which countries are the most promising.&quot; Global Investment<I>
</I>magazine (June 1995) said the &quot;Index&quot; offered &quot;some
surprising insights on why some markets may be chained to the
ground while others are set for takeoff.&quot; And New York Journal
of Commerce Publisher Don C. Becker observed: &quot;... the lesson
to be drawn from this survey is clear. The more economic freedom
people are allowed, the less interference there is from government,
the faster the nations prosper.&quot;
<P>
 Kim Holmes, Ph. D., vice president and director of foreign-policy
studies at The Heritage Foundation, said, &quot;The evidence is
incontrovertable: Economic freedom produces economic prosperity.
No amount of American aid can alter this basic formula.&quot;
<P>
 In a new chapter on using the &quot;Index&quot; as an investment
tool, the authors applied nine additional investment factors to
those countries whose scores on the Heritage &quot;Index&quot;
had improved the most. Of the 24 countries to which the second
set of criteria were applied, Botswana, Indonesia, Israel, Panama
and Portugal scored best. While some of the 24 countries are rated
as economically unfree, all of them, the authors note, &quot;deserve
the close attention of the international investor because they
are liberalizing their economies (hence their improved 'Index'
scores) and building foundations for strong economic growth, an
environment in which most investments do well.&quot;
<P>
 The second edition of the &quot;Index&quot; also confirmed a
trend noted in the first edition -- that &quot;wealthy and economically
free countries tend over time to reintroduce restrictions on economic
freedom. As they become wealthy, countries begin adding welfare
and other social programs that were not affordable when they were
poorer. Thus, after they become economically 'liberated,' countries
like Germany, Sweden and even the United States tend to fall back
down the scale of economic freedom, getting worse scores than
newly emerging free economies like Hong Kong or Singapore.&quot;
Thus, &quot;economic freedom can rise and fall and the seeds of
destruction can exist in the fruits of success.&quot; 
<P>
<I><B>Highlights</B></I>
<P>
 The 1996 &quot;Index of Economic Freedom&quot; provides plenty
of food for thought, the authors noted. For example,
<P>
 <B>Asia:</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Despite the enthusiasm of the investment community, Vietnam
continues to have one of the world's most repressed economies.
<P>
<li>Japan scored worse this year, moving from the &quot;free&quot;
to &quot;mostly free&quot; category, largely as a result of increased
banking regulations.
<P>
<li>India's score likewise declined, largely as a result of its
moves against some foreign investment and continued use of price
controls.
</ul><P>
 Heritage Foundation Vice President Kim Holmes said that &quot;The
'Index of Economic Freedom' provides an especially important benchmark
for evaluating the future success of Hong Kong after it reverts
to Chinese control in 1997. Any backsliding will obviously be
noted.&quot;
<P>
 <B>Europe:</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Europe's freest economies are found in Switzerland, the Netherlands,
Denmark and Luxembourg, rather than the United Kingdom, Germany
or France. With better banking laws, the economies of Switzerland
and the Netherlands both were rated as more free than that of
the United States.
</ul><P>
 <B>Latin America &amp; the Caribbean</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>The Bahamas had the freest economy in the region and the 12th
freest in the world (tied with Canada and the Czech Republic).
It would have scored even better if not for trade restrictions.
<P>
<li>One of the true bright spots was Panama, which jumped ahead
of Chile in the 1996 rankings, making it the Latin American country
with the freest economy. Chile did not backslide; its overall
average also improved from 1995 to 1996. It's just that Panama's
improved even more, largely because Panama depoliticized its money
supply, abolishing its central bank and federal-reserve system
and adopting the U.S. dollar as its official currency. As a result,
the Panamanian government can no longer print money for political
purposes, causing inflation.
<P>
<li>Despite media reports about economic reform in Cuba, the authors
found little to cheer about, ranking Cuba's economy as the most
repressed in Latin America and one of the three most repressed
in the world.
</ul><P>
 <B>Africa/Middle East:</B>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Ten countries in Northern Africa and the Middle East -- Bahrain,
United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Tunisia, Morocco, Jordan, Oman,
Israel, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon -- earned rankings of economically
free or &quot;mostly free.&quot; Just five countries in sub-Saharan
Africa earned such ratings: Botswana, Uganda, Swaziland, Benin
and Zambia.
<P>
<li>While some countries have liberalized their economies  -- Botswana's
score, for example, improved from 3.05 in 1995 to 2.8 in 1996
-- sub-Saharan Africa remains the most economically unfree &quot;and
by far the poorest&quot; region of the world. Indeed, of the 16
countries categorized as &quot;repressed&quot; in the 1996 &quot;Index,&quot; six were in Africa.</ul><p>

<P>
<B>WASHINGTON, D.C.</B>, December 1, 1995-- More than 400 state
legislators from across the country, many of them newly elected,
will attend an orientation conference in Washington, D.C., December
5-9 at the Washington Renaissance Hotel that will be key in the
continuing liberation of America from six decades of intrusive
public policy.
<P>
&quot;This is the perfect opportunity for us to impart to these
new legislators the importance of limited-government, free-market
principles that are our nation's Founders' legacy and the standards
of a just and prosperous nation,&quot; said Colorado State Senator
Ray Powers, the National Chairman of the American Legislative
Exchange Council (ALEC), which sponsors the National Orientation
Conference (NOC) every year. &quot;By educating the new legislators
in the Jeffersonian principles, we are pushing the conservative
movement beyond last year's revolution. What we accomplish at
this conference will shape public policy in the states and nationally
for years to come.&quot;
<P>
<B>Confirmed speakers</B> at this year's NOC include: US. SENATOR
SPENCER ABRAHAM (R Mich.); US. SENATOR JOSEPH LIEBERMAN (D-Conn.);
retired SENATOR MALCOLM WALLOP, former ATTORNEY GENERAL EDWIN
MEESE, MINNESOTA GOVERNOR ARNE CARLSON; CONGRESSMEN ERNEST ISTOOK
(R-Okla.) and JOEL HEFLEY (R Colo..); ED CRANE, President and
CEO of the Cato Institute; JOSEPH BAST, President of the Heartland
Institute; PAUL WEYRICH, President Of the Free Congress Foundation.
<P>
Speakers who are invited but have not yet accepted include U.S.
SUPREME COURT JUSTICE CLARENCE THOMAS, U.S. SENATORS BOB DOLE
(R Kan.), JOHN McCAIN (R Ariz.) and TRENT LOTT (R Miss.), CONGRESSMEN

TOM RIDGE, MICHIGAN GOVERNOR JOHN ENGLER, NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR
CHRISTINE TODD WHITMAN, MASSACHUSETTS GOVERNOR WILLIAM WELD, VIRGINIA
GOVERNOR GEORGE ALLEN, NEBRASKA GOVERNOR BEN NELSON and UTAH GOVERNOR
MIKE LEAVITT.
<P>
Also scheduled for the NOC is the presentation of the <B>1995
Warren Brookes Award for Excellence in Journalism</B> to Don Lanbro,
chief political correspondent for the Washington Times. Lambro
will be honored at a luncheon Friday, December 8 beginning at
12:15 p.m.
<P>
Last year's NOC was the largest one in ALEC's history. Attended
by 412 legislators, it was more than twice the size of any previous
NOC. About 250 private sector members attended, as well. Similar
attendance is expected at this year's meeting.
<P><a name="cred"></a>
<B>Credentialing Procedure</B>:
<P>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, NOV. 15, 1995</b> -- The U.S. delegation at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum meeting this weekend in Japan should work to revive the group's commitment to free trade in the region, which is being seriously undermined by the protectionist policies of Japan and China, according to a study released today by The Heritage Foundation.<P>
	Leaders from Asia and the Americas will meet under the auspices of APEC, an organization of Asia and Pacific Rim countries that have pledged to create free trade in the Asia and Pacific Rim by 2020.  President Clinton is expected to attend the meeting if  the budget battle with Congress does not keep him in Washington.<P>
	According to Heritage Foundation Policy Analyst Robert O'Quinn, author of the study, 	 Japan's proposal to allow APEC nations to exempt "sensitive economic sectors" like agriculture from free trade is an ominous sign for the future of APEC. "The proposal has become a flash point, dividing APEC into two warring camps. On one side are Japan and China, who want exemptions; on the other side are Australia, Canada, Chile, New Zealand, and the United States, who oppose exempting sectors from APEC trade liberalization," O'Quinn says.<P>   
	At the meeting, the U.S. delegation should:<P>

<ul><li>Tell Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama that selective exemptions to trade liberalization are unacceptable and threaten America's vital national interests. "Once one member is permitted to exempt a sensitive sector of their economy, other members will follow suit with their own protectionist demands," O'Quinn warns.
	<P><LI> Work closely with the leaders of Australia, Canada, Chile, Indonesia and New Zealand to block Japan's protectionist proposal. O'Quinn says the United States has some leverage here because most other APEC members disagree with Japan's protectionist approach. "The key will be to forge a consensus," says O'Quinn.   
	<P><li>Stress that blocking or delaying comprehensive trade liberalization would undermine APEC's institutional credibility. "Backsliding on free trade at Osaka could ring the death knell for APEC as an organization," O'Quinn warns.</ul>
	<P>The importance of APEC to the U.S. economy is illustrated in a related paper by Heritage Foundation Research Assistant John Dori. For example, Dori says, "in 1994, U.S. exports to East Asia and the Pacific Rim totaled more than $150 billion. More exports to Asia means more jobs for Americans." He says that in 1994, more than three million Americans owed their jobs to U.S. exports to Asia.<P>

<b>WASHINGTON, NOV. 13, 1995</b> -- Families would gain $32 billion in real disposable income over seven years, wages would increase faster and first-time home buyers would spend less on new mortgages if the congressional plan to cut taxes and balance the federal budget is approved, according to a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/beach.html">Heritage Foundation computer model study</a>.
	<P>"Over the next seven years, Congress's budget plan would lead to greater business investment, higher earnings per hour, and faster economic growth," Heritage Visiting Fellow in Tax Analysis <a href="/heritage/staff/beach.htm">William Beach</a> says in the study, which is based on one of the same econometric models of the U.S. economy used by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, the Federal Reserve Board and other government bodies. Beach testified about the study today before a House Republican Policy Committee hearing on how the congressional budget reconciliation bill will affect the economy.
	<P>"Critics of balancing the budget by 2002 and simultaneously cutting taxes argue that these changes will send the economy into a recession," Beach says. "But this study shows that not only does no recession result at any time during the seven-year period, but the economy grows faster with these proposed budget changes than it would without them."
	<P> Beach says when lower federal taxes and a balanced federal budget are fed through the econometric model, developed by Lawrence H. Meyer & Associates, the result is higher household spending, lower interest rates, increased productivity, greater capital investment, and less inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Producer Price Index (PPI).<P>
	Housing starts and investment in new business machinery would increase by 2.1 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively, the study says. The computer segment of business durable equipment purchases would increase 2.9 percent, compared to current policy.
	<P>The study projects a slightly higher unemployment rate under the balanced-budget plan, due chiefly to a loss of public-sector jobs and lowered government demand for goods and services. The study notes, however, that its assumptions do not include action by the Federal Reserve to stimulate the economy and thus create additional private-sector employment growth to absorb former public-sector workers.
<P>	Beach says the study's results may surprise both supporters and opponents of the congressional reconciliation package. "Supporters may have expected the economy to respond to a balanced budget with tax cuts more immediately, but the study indicates that the primary effect of balancing the budget is a steady, long-term improvement in the economy, not a short-term boost. Congress also would need to enact major reforms of the tax code to spur the very large level of capital formation and growth that proponents of, say, a flat tax predict."
	<P>Opponents of the reconciliation bill "should take comfort in the likelihood that the plan will not undermine economic growth, and will lower interest rates and inflation," Beach says.<P>

<h2>U.S.-Led Missile Defense System Urged for Asia</h2>
<h4>U.S. Critical To Shielding
Asian Allies From China</h4></center><P>


<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations</b>
<p>


	<b>WASHINGTON, OCT. 24, 1995</b> --  America can best protect itself and its Asian allies against growing nuclear threats from China and North Korea by deploying as soon as possible both a national missile defense system for the continental United States, and theater missile defenses to protect U.S. naval and ground forces throughout the Pacific region, according to a new Heritage Foundation study released today.
<p>	Congress is currently considering alternative deployment schedules for missile defense systems as part of the 1996 military spending measure. A national missile defense system would intercept enemy missiles aimed at targets within the continental United States, while a theater missile defense system would knock down enemy missiles targeted against American militiary forces operating overseas or against U.S. allies.
<P>	Japan, South Korea and Australia should also be encouraged to buy and field their own American-made theater missile defense systems, while U.S. officials also should pressure China to limit its offensive nuclear missiles in exchange for sharing U.S. missile defense data, says the study's author, Heritage Senior Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/fisher.htm">Richard Fisher</a>.
<p>	"A national missile defense system is needed not only to defend Americans, but to demonstrate to U.S. allies and friends that they too need not be vulnerable to nuclear attack or blackmail," says Fisher. "The administration can enhance security in Asia by pursuing a strategy that defends Americans against missile attack and extends that umbrella to protect America's allies and friends throughout the region."
<p>	Failure to take these actions risks allowing The People's Republic of China or North Korea to use their own growing offensive missile capabilities to checkmate U.S. military strength in the Pacific region, and to intimidate U.S. allies throughout Asia, as occurred earlier this year when China "in a blatant act of intimidation" tested several of its weapons barely 100 miles from The Republic of China on Taiwan, Fisher says.
<p>	"Armed with nuclear warheads, these Chinese missiles could be used to devastate American bases or naval formations in Asia," Fisher points out. "China is believed to have about 300 nuclear warheads for its missile force. By the year 2010, according to one estimate, China could have 50 to 70 intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching the United States from bases in China," notes Fisher.	China also is developing two new mobile missiles capable of hitting the western United States, and may have hired Russian technicians to aid in producing cruise missiles similar to the U.S. Tomahawk. China has even bought 60 Russian-made missile interceptors similar to the U.S. Patriot.
<p>	At the same time, North Korea is proceeding with work on its Taepo Dong missiles, which, Fisher says, "would give Pyongyang the capability to target U.S. forces in Guam, and possibly the western half of the continental United States, plus Europe, East Asia and Australia."
<p>	Fisher believes a national missile defense system would protect America's heartland against these emerging Chinese and North Korean  threats,  while theater defenses would provide a shield for U.S. forces stationed throughout the Pacific region and the U.S. allies they are defending. Without a credible U.S. response, America's Asian allies will be forced to seek their own deterrents to such intimidation.
<p>	Both houses of Congress have approved 1996 defense authorization bills that devote more than $3.5 billion to both national and theater missile defense systems, including the "Brilliant Eyes" space-based sensor system used to identify and track enemy missiles. That amount is about $1 billion more than requested by the Clinton administration.
<p>	The bills now in House-Senate conference would accelerate deployment of the two major theater systems -- the Navy's "Upper Tier" system and the Army's Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system -- to 1997. By contrast, the Clinton administration has set no official date to begin THAAD deployment, and sought only minimal Upper Tier funding.
<p>	Fisher says U.S. officials should urge U.S. allies in Asia to purchase American theater missile defense systems, enter into co-development programs, and then explore multilateral cooperation in missile defense activities. "By cooperating with Washington to develop and fund missile defenses, Asian nations for the first time will be able to share the burden of defending the United States and other countries from nuclear missile threats," Fisher says.
<p>	Finally, Fisher recommends that the United States inform China that it must live up to its commitments under the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty and should join the Missile Technology Control Regime backed by the United States that limits the export of offensive missile technology. "Washington should tell Beijing that if it agrees to talks aimed at verifiable limits on its nuclear arsensal, the United States will make available to China early warning data from U.S.theater missile defense systems," Fisher says.
<p>	These actions must be taken by the United States because it is the only nation with "the technical capability and the moral vision to prevent its allies from falling victim to nuclear blackmail or engaging in destabilizing nuclear proliferation," Fisher says.

<h4>DOL Responsibilities Should
 Be Turned Over To States</h4></center><p>

<p>
	<b>WASHINGTON, OCT. 23, 1995</b>  -- To reduce the job-killing cost and complexity of today's labor regulations while maintaining employment protections and workplace safety, Congress should abolish the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) and shift its legitimate functions to the states, according to a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1058.html">Heritage Foundation study</a> released today.
<p>	"The proliferation of DOL regulations, while failing to make things significantly better for American workers, present a serious barrier to the creation of businesses and jobs," says <a href="/heritage/staff/wilson.htm">Mark Wilson</a>, Heritage's Rebecca Lukens Fellow in Labor Policy. "Closing down the agency as a Cabinet-level department and shifting virtually all of its functions to the states could save as much as $10.5 billion during the next five years," he says.
<p>	In his comprehensive plan for abolishing the Labor Department, Wilson points out that about 75 percent of the department's current $38.8 billion budget is made up of funding for unemployment insurance and for employment services to the states, with job training constituting another 20 percent. "By turning over responsibility for these programs to the states, Congress could take 95 percent of what the DOL does away from far-away Washington bureaucrats and place responsibility for these tasks in the hands of state governments, which are closer to the real problems," Wilson says. This would enable states "to limit the duration of unemployment benefits, reduce payroll taxes, increase jobs, and try new ways to privatize many of DOL's functions," says Wilson.
<p>	Among the job-training programs for the economically disadvantaged that Wilson says should be consolidated into a single block grant to the states are the Job Corps, Senior Community Service Employment Program, Migrant and Seasonal Farm Workers Training, and Indian and Native American Employment and Training. Wilson says states should be required to focus resources for these programs on job placement and to objectively measure the effectiveness of each.
<p>	All other present DOL-funded job-training programs, he says, could be folded into another block grant, which would include programs for dislocated workers, the School-to-Work and Adult Technology Learning programs, Wilson says. "Even DOL itself has acknowledged that making block grants of these programs would eliminate conflicting rules and administrative structures, remove bureaucracy at every level, and end the wasting of tax dollars," he says.
<p>	Wilson says Congress, as part of the process of dismantling DOL, should repeal outdated labor laws, executive orders and regulations, reform the Fair Labor Standards Act and abolish the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs. It should repeal the executive order for affirmative action and related regulations governing federal contractors and subcontractors, he says.
<p>	Under Wilson's plan, the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau would be shifted to a newly-created sub-Cabinet agency called the Bureau of National Statistics, as proposed earlier this year by The Heritage Foundation in a proposal for reorganizing the federal government and balancing the federal budget.
<p>	At the same time, DOL's Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Mine Safety and Health Administration should be combined, Wilson says, and the newly formed agency made subject to an independent workplace standards-setting board. The new board would "redefine the role of the federal government in workplace safety from that of heavy-handed regulator to one of cooperative partner with the private sector," Wilson says. 
<p>	"Labor market conditions and labor-management relations have changed dramatically since the days when most of America's labor laws were written and the Labor Department that enforces them was created," says Wilson. "Workers are demanding more flexible hours, working conditions and compensation packages than current law and regulations allow. This means a fundamental rethinking of DOL and federal labor policy is needed."
<p>	"Congress should move aggressively to abolish DOL and reform federal labor law to insure that excessive regulatory burdens are removed, labor market flexibility is increased for workers and businesses alike, and basic workplace safety protections are made more effective," Wilson says.<p><p>

<h2>LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION
 SHOULD BE ABOLISHED, ANALYSTS SAY</h2></center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations</b>

<p>

<b>	WASHINGTON, OCT. 17, 1995</b> -- The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) should be abolished because it routinely engages in political advocacy and frequently lobbies at taxpayer expense for expanded welfare spending, according to a new Heritage Foundation <a href="/heritage/library/categories/crimelaw/bg1057.html">study</a>  released today.
<p>	Among the causes LSC supports with taxpayer funds are adoption rights for homosexuals, preventing drug dealers' evictions from public housing, racial quotas in higher education and protecting welfare benefits for illegal immigrants, according to the study's authors, Kenneth F. Boehm and Peter T. Flaherty, who are, respectively, chairman and president of the Vienna, Virginia-based National Legal and Policy Center.
<p>	Reforming LSC is not feasible, say Boehm and Flaherty, because it is virtually unaccountable to taxpayers who fund it and beyond effective oversight by either Congress or the president.
<p>	"For the past 30 years, LSC has been the legal pillar of the welfare state. Through its litigation, advocacy and lobbying, LSC has caused hundreds of billions of dollars in increased local, state and federal welfare spending, and helped add millions of people to the welfare rolls," say Boehm and Flaherty. "LSC cannot be reformed because it was designed to avoid external controls. It should be abolished," they say of the federal corporation that is supposed to help poor people who can't afford to hire an attorney.
	<p>LSC-supported groups have successfully sought countless federal and state court decisions to nullify "moral" conditions connected to welfare benefits such as identifying fathers of illegitimate children, the authors say. Too often, such cases are pursued by LSC-funded groups at the expense of genuine problems facing poor people such as bankruptcy, child-support, custody and guardianship proceedings, landlord controversies, and employment issues, Boehm and Flaherty say.
<p>	At the root of the problem is LSC's legal structure and the unaccountability that structure fosters. Chartered by Congress in 1974 as a independent, private, non-profit corporation,  LSC receives about $400 million in federal funds annually. The way the corporation distributes its money "makes it immune from the safeguards that govern other federal spending," say Boehm and Flaherty. 
<p>	The LSC distributes the money it gets from Congress in the form of grants to 323 private lawyers' groups across the country. At the same time, these groups also receive funds (about $225 million annually) from state and local governments, lawyers groups, and other private sources.
<p>	Even though Congress gives LSC millions of federal dollars every year, LSC employees are not considered federal employees under the corporation's federal charter. As a result, LSC's "status as a private corporation exempts it from provisions of the federal criminal code, including the Anti-Deficiency Act that makes it a felony for government workers to misappropriate public money," say Boehm and Flaherty.
<p>	Further removing LSC from even minimal scrutiny is the fact that nobody outside of the corporation knows how it spends public funds, since its attorneys keep no time sheets, and it is impossible to judge how well LSC attorneys represent clients because all case records are kept secret under a claim of attorney-client privilege.
<p>	"Lack of timekeeping prevents oversight by eliminating the only real way to track the activities of LSC lawyers, and there are no provisions for waiving the attorney-client privilege for purposes of oversight, even though tax funds pay for the services rendered," say Boehm and Flaherty.
<p>	Taken together, these factors mean "it makes little difference who sits in the White House, in Congress or on the LSC's governing board. As long as they flow through the LSC to its 323 grantees, public funds will be spent to further a political agenda that serves the interests of the welfare state and its allies against those of productive taxpayers," contend Boehm and Flaherty.
<p>	"Because money is fungible in the hands of private groups with more than one funding source, no new restrictions can insure the accountability of taxpayer funds given LSC. For the sake of the American taxpayer and for the sake of America's poor, it is time to abolish LSC," Boehm and Flaherty say.

<b>For Immediate Release<br>

<p>
	<b>WASHINGTON, OCTOBER 16, 1995</b> -- If Medicare is not reformed,  industry and government will have to pass on additional yearly costs of at least $7.4 billion to investors, consumers and taxpayers and $115.7 billion in direct taxes and reduced wages to workers, according to a Heritage Foundation analysis released today.
<p>	The authors of the study, senior fellow <a href="/heritage/staff/winston.htm">David Winston</a> and domestic policy research analysts Christine Olson and Rea Hederman, have included an industry-by-industry analysis showing how much businesses, employees and consumers will have to pay each year as a result of an additional 3.52 percent Medicare payroll tax the program's trustees say will be necessary to finance the current system without reform. 
<P>	Topping the industry list are retail trade, educational services and public administration, which together will shoulder nearly $15 billion, or 25 percent of the yearly cost of the additional tax before passing it on to employees, customers and investors. "Businesses and employees in the retail trade industry alone will pay more than $13.3 billion in extra payroll taxes each year -- with employees picking up more than $12.5 billion of that tab -- if Medicare is not reformed," the Heritage analysts say.
<p>	"The reason the burden is so heavy on employees is that an increase in payroll taxes technically is shared by both the employer and the employee. Experience shows that about 88 percent of the cost of additional employer taxes is passed on to workers in the form of reduced wages and compensation," according to the study. 
<p>	"Without significant reform of the system or increases in the current payroll tax to maintain the level of benefits and spending, Medicare will go bankrupt," the analysts say. "For Medicare to remain financially solvent and able to pay for hospital care for today's 'baby boomers' when they retire, Congress needs to either find additional money or slow down its rate of spending."

<title>Flat Tax Earns High Marks -- Heritage PR</title>

<h2>FLAT TAX EARNS HIGH MARKS 
IN STUDY OF TAX REFORM PLANS</h2></center>

<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations</b><br>
<p>

<b>	WASHINGTON, SEPT. 26, 1995</b> -- Of all the tax-reform proposals ready to be considered by Congress, the flat tax proposal sponsored by House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey, R-Texas, and Sen. Richard Selby, R-Ala., received the highest marks in a Heritage Foundation study released today. <p>
	The study, conducted by Heritage economist <a href="/heritage/staff/mitchell.htm">Daniel Mitchell</a>, McKenna senior fellow in political economy, is aimed at assisting lawmakers, who must decide which of the major tax-reform proposals is best for taxpayers and the U.S. economy. 
<p>	"Tax reform is gaining momentum. The existing income-tax system is fundamentally broken and cannot be fixed without a complete overhaul," Mitchell says. "Of all the plans currently being considered in Congress, the Armey flat tax addresses the most serious problems in the simplest, most straight-forward way."
<p>	The Armey plan would ensure fairness by taxing individuals and businesses with a 17 percent flat rate on all income. The plan, which is based on the model developed by Stanford Professor Robert Hall and Hoover Institution Senior Fellow Alvin Rabushka, would ensure simplicity by allowing taxes to be filed using a postcard-sized return. By contrast, the current income-tax system has more than 400 different forms.
<p>	Mitchell says the flat tax's low rate would encourage economic growth by increasing the value of income-producing assets, such as rental property and investments of all kinds. On the other hand, he says, the flat tax would reduce the incentive to invest in tax shelters, a practice that keeps huge amounts of capital from circulating and producing wealth in the U.S. economy. "With these extra billions in circulation, all Americans will benefit," Mitchell says. 
<p>	The flat tax also would end the practice of using the tax system for social engineering. Mitchell says by removing the progressive component from America's tax structure, the flat tax would stop penalizing economic success. It would encourage savings and investment by taxing income only once, and would significantly reduce the number of preferences and deductions now available under the existing income tax code.
<p>	Another version of the flat tax, sponsored by Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., also received high marks from Mitchell. But the Specter proposal seeks a slightly higher rate (20 percent) and would allow for some limited deductions for charitable contributions, including the full deduction for home mortgages. Mitchell says the Specter flat-tax plan is less attractive because it would still allow for government micromanagement of the economy.
<p>	But either way, Mitchell says the time is ripe for reform of the current tax system. "Its complexity forces even the most sophisticated Americans to pay professionals to fill out their tax forms; one study put annual compliance costs at nearly $200 billion." The current system subjects some forms of income, particularly from savings and investment, to as many as four different levels of taxation. "For example, under the current tax system, a single dollar of income can be subject to the corporate income tax, the personal income tax, the capital gains tax, and estate taxes," he says. 
<P>	"Politicians have turned the tax code into a bewildering system of special preferences, penalties and deductions," Mitchell says. Such complexity is inevitable in a system that rewards those with expensive lawyers and accountants and allows lawmakers to micromanage the economy. Mitchell says the system will never change as long as politicians are able to collect large campaign contributions from donors seeking to change or preserve sections of the tax code. 
<p>	"While other reform proposals, such as the value added (VAT) tax and the national sales tax, have some advantages, they contained features that more closely resembled the current system, offering little or no improvement over the status quo," he says.

<title>Federal Health Program Success Lesson for Medicare Reform -- Heritage PR</title>

<h2>FEDERAL HEALTH PROGRAM SUCCESS IS LESSON
 FOR MEDICARE REFORMERS, ANALYST SAYS</h2></center><hr>
<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations</b>
<p>

	<b>WASHINGTON, SEPT. 25, 1995</b> -- Medicare reformers in Congress should heed important lessons on consumer choice and health insurance cost controls demonstrated by the highly successful Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), according to a Heritage Foundation analyst.
<p>	"The FEHBP has shown a remarkable success in controlling costs. While average premium increases next year will be only four-tenths of one percent, FEHBP enrollees last year experienced an average annual decrease of 3.3 percent," says Heritage Deputy Director of Domestic Policy Studies <a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">Robert E. Moffit</a> in a study released today. FEHBP contrasts sharply with the current  Medicare system's 10.5 percent per year average increase. Annual private-sector price increases have averaged 6 percent per year during a comparable period, according to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which administers FEHBP.<p>
	House Republicans recently proposed a package of Medicare reforms that "take some modest steps" in directions suggested by Heritage health care experts. But the FEHBP experience ought to provide further policy direction for congressional reformers, Moffit says.
<p>	The vivid contrast between Medicare's spiralling costs and FEHBP's successful cost controls is due to the fact that FEHBP -- which covers nine million members of Congress and their staffs, federal employees, retirees and their families -- holds down premium costs by depending primarily upon consumer choice and competition among about 400 coverage providers, says Moffit.
<p>	Significantly, FEHBP's ability to hold costs down is achieved despite covering what is far from an ideal insurance pool, he says. "Older workers and retirees cost significantly more to cover than younger, more active employees. The federal workforce is older than the private-sector workforce: the average federal worker is almost 44 years of age, while the average private-sector worker is about 38 years of age. Moreover, the ratio of retirees to active workers has increased steadily during the past several years, so that nearly 40 percent of all FEHBP subscribers are retirees," according to Moffit.
   <p>	 By comparison to Medicare's "one-size-fits-all" approach, "FEHBP shows that giving enrollees the right to choose plans in a comprehensive market forces insurers to improve value for money, not simply to cut costs," Moffit says.
<p>	Government workers and retirees would have fared even better in FEHBP in recent years if Congress had changed the program to a defined contribution that is indexed to inflation, rather than retaining the current complex formula, Moffit says. The formula is based on the average premiums for the six largest FEHBP insurance providers, with a statutory ceiling of the government's share of premium costs set at 75 percent.
<p>	Converting FEHBP to a defined contribution consisting of "a clearly defined annual dollar amount" with future increases tied to the Consumer Price Index "would give private insurers a powerful incentive for offering attractive packages of benefits at a price equal to or even less than the amount of the government's contribution. This would reduce the out-of-pocket costs to workers and retirees and increase their savings even more," says Moffit.
<p> 	In a related study released today, Heritage Vice President <a href="/heritage/staff/butler.htm">Stuart Butler</a> says Congress is now considering Medicare reforms that would set up a system somewhat like FEHBP.  But further reforms are needed to complete the task of creating "a Medicare program that moderates the growth in costs, while giving America's elderly many new choices and much more control over their own health care."
<p>	The most important provision of the House Medicare reform plan, for example, is the Medicare Plus option, which allows seniors to choose a private-sector health plan paid with a government contribution based on the enrollee's age and other basic risk factors, Butler says.
<p>	But other features of the House plan "raise concerns," according to Butler, including a provision "to use the failed approach of price controls" to limit government Medicare spending. The House plan also makes the "serious mistake" of making Medicare Plus plans cap their deductibles and co-payments at the same level required by the traditional Medicare plan.
<p>	Butler also faults the House plan for requiring Medicare Plus plans to match the benefits offered by the traditional Medicare program. Congress should instead follow FEHBP's statuatory language requiring insurers to provide a basic core of benefits, but otherwise leave them free to group benefits, medical procedures, treatments, and costs in packages as they see fit.
<p>	"These and other problems need to be dealt with, but overall the House plan indicates that Congress is at last prepared to make the changes needed to stabilize Medicare's finances so that it is still there when today's workers reach retirement," says Butler.

<b>WASHINGTON, SEPT. 22, 1995</b> To end the nation's vulnerability to ballistic-missile attack as quickly as possible, congressional conferees should reject the House version of the defense authorization bill and endorse the Senate bill's "clear, concise and detailed instructions" for deployment of a national missile-defense system in the year 2003, according to a Heritage Foundation analyst.
<p>	"Without a specific deployment date and a detailed plan, nothing will be deployed because the Clinton administration -- since it is against erecting missile defenses in the first place -- will use the lack of a timetable to put off deployment indefinitely," according to Heritage Senior Defense Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/spring.htm">Baker Spring</a>. Because of this factor, Spring says "Congress cannot afford to give the administration much leeway, and the Senate bill doesn't give it."
<p>	Spring says the Senate bill includes detailed instructions that are much needed but lacking in the House bill. For example, he says in addition to instructions for National Missile Defenses (NMD), the Senate measure fixes the same starting date for deployment of Theater Missile Defenses (TMD), to protect U.S. allies and forces stationed overseas, and defines the core programs the Pentagon will need to erect both systems.   
<p>	For the NMD system, Spring says, the Senate bill includes instructions for "deploying interceptors at more than one site, establishing both interim and initial deployment dates, and setting forth specific options for upgrading existing radars and streamlining acquisition procedures." For TMD systems, the Senate bill designates as core programs "an upgraded Patriot Missile, the Navy Lower and Upper Tier defense systems and the Army's Theater High-Altitude-Area Defense system." The House version, by contrast, contains no instructions for TMD deployment or requirements.
<p>	"Further, the Senate bill would insure that TMD systems are capable of working together so several systems could be used against the same missile attack," Spring points out. Also, the Senate measure lets TMD systems use data from external sensors, including those based in space, to identify and track targets, and "requires the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress next year on the options available for augmenting ground-, sea- and space-based defenses." This last requirement, Spring says, "will force the Pentagon to examine the advantages of sea- and space-based over more expensive ground-based defenses."
<p>	Spring says the Senate bill takes the proper approach toward the future of the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty. "By requiring a comprehensive review of the pact to determine its continuing value and validity," the Senate bill creates an opening for eventually doing away with the ABM treaty, since it was signed with the former Soviet Union, and is often used to make a case against missile defenses.
<p>	On all of these issues, Spring says congressional conferees should "move as quickly as possible; otherwise the nation will remain needlessly vulnerable to ballistic-missile attack."

	WASHINGTON, SEPT. 20, 1995</B> -- The combined general and payroll tax hike that will be needed to save Medicare -- if Congress doesn't restructure the system -- will increase the tax burden by more than a trillion dollars over the next five years, according to analysts at The Heritage Foundation. The other alternative would be a steep cutback in services.
<P>	The options before Congress are limited, say Heritage analysts Robert Moffit, John Liu and David Winston in a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/fyi62.html">report</a> released today. Congress must either restructure and reform the program along the lines of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), which allows consumer choice and market competition to keep health-care prices down, dramatically increase payroll and general taxes on American families and businesses, or drastically cut back on services for the elderly.
<P>	"The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) already projects that during the next five years Medicare Part B, which covers doctors' fees and other services, will need an estimated $370.5 billion in general taxes," the Heritage analysts say. On top of that, if Congress resorts to an increase in the payroll tax to save Medicare Part A, the hospitalization program trust fund, this will require an estimated 3.5 percent hike on top of the current level of 2.9 percent, or $711 billion in new revenue over the next five years. "Right now, when you look at the  combined level of taxation needed to save Medicare, the amount is almost triple President Clinton's 1993 tax hike, which ranks as the largest in U.S. history."	
<P>	Yet, the Heritage analysts say transforming Medicare into a health-care program that would work like FEHBP, the popular 35-year-old consumer-driven program that covers retired congressional and federal workers, "would allow Medicare users to pick government-certified private insurance plans and receive a government contribution toward the purchase of those plans. What Heritage proposes is a far more attractive alternative than strangling American workers and businesses with enormous new taxes," the analysts say.
<P>  	They also warn of the possible effects of such taxation. "Any new payroll tax assessed to shore up Medicare ultimately will be felt by America's working families in the form of reduced wages or compensation and in some cases, even the loss of jobs."
<P>	The Heritage analysts point out that while Congress is focusing mainly on fixing Medicare Part A, it must also deal with Part B in order to come up with a permanent solution for Medicare's financial plight. Again, without a major restructuring of the entire Medicare system, CBO projections indicate that the taxes needed to fund Part B will jump from an estimated $57.5 billion in 1996 to $93.5 billion by the year 2000.
<P>	The Heritage analysts used 1993 earnings data to compute the <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/wel-62mp.html">state-by-state impact</a> of a 3.5 percent payroll tax increase -- the estimated figure needed to achieve long-term actuarial balance for the Medicare system -- on workers throughout the country. They found that if such a payroll tax increase had been in effect in 1993, employees and employers would have faced more than $123 billion in new taxes that year. Under this scenario, wage earners in Wyoming would have faced a total of $101.2 million in additional taxes, the low range, while California wage earners would have paid an additional $7.7 billion.
<P>	Even worse, employees would have suffered more than $115 billion in lost earnings. On average, the combined tax and wage loss to employees would have ranged from $656 in Arkansas to $1,081 in New Jersey. Similar significant losses were projected throughout the country.
<P>	"No one wants to drastically cut back Medicare services or impose yet another biggest-in-history tax hike on the American people," the Heritage analysts warn. "That's why it's so important that Congress take a serious look at the only viable alternative: restructuring of Medicare along the lines of  market competition and consumer choice."

<H2> FREEING FARMERS WOULD PRODUCE
$135 BILLION BOOST, ANALYSTS SAY</h2></center>
<h3>State-by-State Analysis
Reveals Billion-Dollar Winners</h3>




<b>For Immediate Release<br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations<br>
<p>
	WASHINGTON, SEPT. 19, 1995</b> -- Freeing America's farmers by ending New Deal-era crop subsidies, price supports and land reserves would generate $135 billion in new income distributed throughout all 50 states during the next decade, according to a new Heritage Foundation study released today.
<p>	The study  -- based on a computer model of the nation's economy developed by Heritage to measure the impact of ending the federal farm program -- comes as Congress considers reforms of a wide range of agriculture programs.
<p>	"Freeing U.S. farmers would bring millions of previously idle acres back into productive use, and generate a $135 billion expansion of the nation's economy," say Heritage Fellows <a href="/heritage/staff/fryden.htm">John Frydenlund</a> and <a href="/heritage/staff/winston.htm">David Winston</a>, co-authors of the Heritage study. "Every state would share in the economic expansion -- even those that are not agriculture producers -- because they supply farmers elsewhere or handle farm products."
<p>	Increased farm production would fuel demand for seed, fertilizer and equipment such as tractors, as well as generate expansion of the food processing, packaging, transportation and shipping industries, the Heritage analysts say.
<p>	Earlier this year, Frydenlund wrote Heritage's comprehensive proposal for agriculture reform, called "Freeing America's Farmers: The Heritage Plan for Rural Prosperity." The Heritage proposal suggests ending the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) that keeps more than 36 million acres of farm land idle. This government attempt to control farm prices limits the supply of a wide variety of crops and products, including wheat, corn, cotton, rice, sugar, peanuts and milk.
<p>	The Heritage plan would phase out CRP over a five-year period, thus freeing U.S. farmers to return the now-idled acres to production to meet worldwide food demand that experts say will triple in coming years.
<p>	"If farmers were free of the controls that now restrict their output, they would enjoy a surge in new income even when modest declines in prices are taken into account," Frydenlund and Winston say. In the first year alone, more than $2 billion net additional farm income would result, with the annual total reaching $4 billion by the year 2001, and more than $18 billion annually thereafter.
<p>	In Kansas, for example, farmers (primarily wheat producers) would enjoy a $1 billion boost in the first year, while in Iowa, a leading corn producer, the first-year increase would exceed $800 million. For Texas, a major producer of most farm products, the increase would exceed $1 billion, Frydenlund and Winston say.
<p>	Non-farm states like Rhode Island "would reap large benefits" as a result of increased demand for shipping and transportation services, especially those related to exports. In fact, any state with significant export activities or port facilities, such as Louisiana and a number of other coastal and Great Lakes states, would derive more in benefits than they would gain through increased agricultural production," observe Frydenlund and Winston. A state-by-state analysis is included with the study.
<p>	 In a related study to be released later this week, Frydenlund says the sugar, peanut and dairy programs are perfect examples of why reform is needed. All three programs are "beyond repair and no amount of tinkering can fix them," says Frydenlund, because each uses complex systems of quotas and allotments to limit who can produce how much for sale at what price, as well as where it can be grown and where it can be sold.
<p>	The sugar program, for example, "is big government and corporate welfare at its worst. Almost half of the estimated $1.4 billion in federal benefits created by the program go to 1 percent of the sugar growers. In fact, 33 growers and corporations each receive more than $1 million per year, and a Florida family received more than $65 million in one year alone," says Frydenlund.
<p>	"Incremental changes in these programs will not be reform. Instead, Congress needs to adopt real reform of these programs by either eliminating or gradually phasing out the quotas and allotments that benefit so few at the expense of consumers," the Heritage analysts say.<p>

<h3>   
<center>TOWN HALL Hosts Bob Dornan Conference On-Line<br>
CompuServe reserves Convention Center for event</center>
</h3>
<p>
WASHINGTON, DC, September 18, 1995 -- Town Hall announced today that it will be hosting an on-line conference featuring California Republican Congressman and presidential hopeful, Robert "B-1 Bob" Dornan. The conference will be held in the CompuServe convention center on Friday, September 22, 1995 from 9:00 p.m. - 11:00 p.m. (EST).  Any CompuServe member can participate by typing CONVENTION at the GO prompt.
<P>
Rep. Dornan will discuss his race for the 1996 GOP presidential nomination and why he believes it so important that the views he holds be openly and strongly discussed in the public arena. These views include tax relief for American families, a Balanced Budget Amendment, the protection of innocent, pre-born children, school choice and school prayer, a strong national defense and immigration reform.
<P>
Not surprisingly, Dornan's views are often attacked by the national
media as "extremist" or "far right." But Dornan, an Irish-Catholic who
scored a perfect 1994 rating from the American Conservative Union
(ACU), has confounded critics by consistently winning in a majority
Democrat district without ever backing away from his core conservative
beliefs. 
<P>
This is Rep. Dornan's second on-line conference through Town Hall. The overwhelming popularity of his first conference required Town Hall to utilize the CompuServe's larger convention hall that has a capacity for over 1,000 on-line users.
<P>
Dornan represents California's 46th Congressional District -- a community that includes most of the Orange County cities of Anaheim, Santa Ana and Garden Grove. Rep. Dornan is Ranking Republican Member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and Chairman of the Subcommittee on Tactical and Technical Intelligence, Member of the House National Security Committee and Chairman of its Subcommittee on Personnel.
<P>
Town Hall, Inc., based in Washington, DC, is the nation's leading interactive computer network for conservatives.  A project of The Heritage Foundation and National Review magazine, Town Hall offers conservatives both an Internet site (http://www.townhall.com) and a private forum on CompuServe to share ideas, conduct research, and plan strategy.  CompuServe users can access the Town Hall forum by typing TOWNHALL at the GO prompt.  Other personal computer users can obtain a free 30-day trial to Town Hall by calling 800-441-4142.

<h2><center> HOUSE SPENDING BILLS FALL FAR SHORT OF PROMISED  GOVERNMENT OVERHAUL, ANALYSTS SAY</h2> </center>
Contact: Jeff Dickerson or Weldon Freeman, Heritage Public Relations at (202) 675-1761 <br><br>
<b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</b><br><br>





	<b>WASHINGTON, SEPT. 15, 1995</b> -- Instead of  carrying out the voters' mandate for a radical overhaul of the federal government, the new House spending bills "merely downsize the status quo, leaving the door open to return to bloated, wasteful spending in a few short years," according to a study released today by The Heritage Foundation.
<p>	The study focuses on 11 of the 13 appropriations bills approved by the House since May when the chamber approved a plan to balance the federal budget in seven years. While savings achieved by those bills total about $24 billion, many more billions could be saved if the House terminated obsolete programs, as suggested by Heritage earlier this year in a detailed study showing how to reduce the number of Cabinet-level departments from the current 14 to five.
<p>	Rather than terminating obsolete programs, however, the House imposed relatively equal across-the-board spending cuts that otherwise leave the programs alive and well, according to the study by Heritage's Grover M. Herman Fellow in Federal Budgetary Affairs <a href="/heritage/staff/hodge.htm">Scott Hodge</a> and budget analyst John Barry.
<p>	"Congress is leaving in place hundreds of obsolete federal programs that ought to be shut down, but that will instead continue to waste taxpayer dollars, just at reduced spending levels," say Hodge and Barry. "This leaves the door open for government to return to the path of increasing deficits and burdensome taxes, as happened when Reagan-era spending cuts were restored by the Bush and Clinton administrations."
<p>	In May, Hodge and Barry point out, Republicans "promised to downsize the government by terminating programs that do not work, eliminating those that have become obsolete or outmoded, consolidating programs that duplicate others, ending corporate welfare, and transferring to state and local governments programs more appropriately carried out by them."
<p>	But instead, appropriations bills adopted since May show the House merely shaved relatively equal amounts from all programs in order to achieve the savings required to balance the budget on schedule, say the Heritage analysts.
<p>	The House agriculture spending bill, for example, "merely trims perennial sources of pork-barrel outlays by 4.3 percent overall," but triples funding for the office of the Agriculture Secretary, boosts by 33 percent the obsolete Rural Electrification Administration's budget, and adds 8 percent to Natural Resources Conservation Service spending.
<p>	Similarly, the Commerce-State-Justice appropriation includes only "modest trims" averaging  4.5 percent, but the Maritime Administration's budget is hiked 23 percent, and programs that ought to be terminated outright like the Economic Development Administration (EDA) and National Telecommunications and Information Administration are kept alive.
<p>	The Energy and Water Development appropriation imposes a "mild 5.5 percent cut on the Army Corps of Engineers, another favorite source of pork-barrel projects," say Hodge and Barry. But the measure pours more tax dollars into other needless spending projects -- like $4.2 million for maintenance of the Sam Rayburn Dam and Lake in Texas -- and puts another $3.3 billion in the Energy Supply, Research and Development program that has received more than $70 billion since 1977 with little or nothing to show for it.
<p>	If Congress is truly serious about restructuring government, Hodge and Barry say, it will use the upcoming conferences on the appropriations bills to terminate such outmoded and obsolete programs as: Job Corps ($1.2 billion); Amtrak subsidies ($628 million);  Appalachian Regional Commission ($142 million),  and Legal Services Corporation ($278 million).
<p>	Corporate welfare programs Congress should cut include: Rural Electrification Administration ($122 million); Export-Import Bank ($786.5 million); Public Broadcasting Facilities Grants ($19 million); Manufacturing Extension Partnership Programs ($81 million),  Small Business Administration ($590 million), and Federal Transit Administration ($3.9 billion).
<p>	If Congress fails to terminate such programs, Hodge and Barry say, there will be a replay of events during the Reagan administration when 94 federal programs were recommended for termination. According to a congressional study, only 12 were actually shut down, and some of them were later replaced by larger, more expensive programs.
<p>	The Small Business Administration (SBA), for instance, was slashed starting in 1981 during Reagan's first term from more than $2 billion to $557 million by 1986. But SBA rebounded during the Bush and Clinton administrations to a budget of nearly $1 billion. Merely trimming agency budgets leaves in place a federal bureaucracy that works hand-in-hand with special-interest groups to pressure Congress to restore funding to previous levels, say Hodge and Barry. This is what they believe may happen if the current House budget passes.
<p>	The Heritage budget analysts praise only two of the House-passed appropriations bills:  Education, Labor and Health and Human Resources, which eliminates 170 programs, and the Interior Department, which eliminates six agencies and 49 programs.

<h2><center>U.S.-ASIAN COMMERCE ON THE RISE  <br>
DESPITE TRADE WAR FEARS<br><br></h2></center>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations<br><br>
<b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</b><br><br>
	<b>WASHINGTON, SEPT. 8, 1995</b> --  America's exports to Asia totaled $153 billion and sustained 3.1 million American jobs in 1994, according to the 1995 edition of the U.S. and Asia Statistical Handbook, compiled by analysts at The Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center (ASC). The just-released Handbook shows a 12 percent increase in exports over the previous year, and the number of Asia-related jobs grew by 500,000.<p>
	ASC analysts caution that this positive trend will be reversed unless the Clinton administration adopts a more non-threatening trans-Pacific free-trade policy. "The confrontational approach to Japan is an example of brinkmanship," says James Przystup, ASC director, "which, were it not for last-minute compromise, almost led to a full-scale trade war."<p>
	
Such a trade war would quickly spread from one Pacific rim nation to another, ASC analysts believe. The resulting bitterness and economic tension would inevitably pit America against its allies - - just at a time when U.S.-Asia multilateral cooperation on security issues is most needed. This is because many countries are concerned about the People's Republic of China's (PRC) growing military strength and the assertive way in which it challenged the Philippines' claims over the Spratly Islands. In addition, the PRC's recent long-range missile exercises near the Republic of China on Taiwan have reinforced Asia's anxiety about Chinese intentions. <p>
	The PRC's muscle-flexing is not the only challenge to existing regional security alliances. "The administration's response to North Korea's nuclear-weapons program has caused consternation among our Asian allies," says ASC Senior Policy Analyst and Handbook Editor Richard D. Fisher. "Throughout 1995," says Fisher, "the administration acted as if its managed-trade agenda held precedence over regional security." <p>
	Fisher says the U.S. policy of trade confrontation - - combined with frequent administration flip-flops on diplomatic issues - - has left Asians confused about the firmness of America's commitment to the goal of open markets. This, in turn, jeopardizes U. S. leadership on global trade, crucial to forums such as the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) organization. Leaders of the major Asian economic powers already are preparing for the scheduled November APEC summit at Osaka, Japan. <p>
	Most governments and businesses in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region at last agree that free-trade is the cornerstone of continued economic growth. "There is opportunity presented by this victory over Asia's long-held protectionist policies," says Fisher, "but we might lose that opportunity because of the administration's seeming abandonment of free trade."<p>
	Handbook data demonstrate how Asia's initial round of market-opening reforms are benefiting  American businesses. A country-by-country analysis reveals that sales of "Made In USA" goods and services are growing in the region's increasingly affluent countries: Malaysia's imports reached $7 billion, an increase of 17 percent over the 1993 level. The level of South Korea's imports from the United States was $18 billion, a 22 percent increase. Singapore's $13 billion represented an 11 percent increase. American exports to Thailand reached $4.9 billion, an increase of 30 percent over 1993.<p>
	Handbook statistics show several states are reaping substantial economic benefits from this explosion of commerce. More than 828,000 California jobs are dependent on Asia-bound exports - -  which rose by 20 percent in 1994 and reached $41.4 billion. In Texas, 247,000 jobs were sustained as exports rose 19 percent above 1993 levels, reaching $12.4 billion. Illinois' $6.6 billion worth of exports - - supporting 131,000 statewide jobs - - represents a 23 percent increase.<p>
	Pacific-bound commerce accounts for a significant share of jobs and income in other states. Pennsylvania, Ohio, Oregon, and New York all witnessed at least 10 percent growth in the value of their Asian exports. Furthermore, the Handbook shows many smaller states are also gaining from this boom. For example, Maryland's $3 billion worth of exports reaching Asian consumers represented a 40 percent increase over the level in 1993, and supported 28,000 jobs.<p>
	Key social, political, military, and economic statistics on all Asia-Pacific nations are included in the Handbook. This year's edition also contains data on 19 Asia-Pacific countries adapted from the Heritage Foundation's Index of Economic Freedom.<p>
	According to Przystup, "the data show that free-trade is a driving force for the economic growth that leads to democratization and security. America dares not lose historic diplomatic and economic opportunities through lack of a coherent policy towards Asia."<p>

<b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</b><p>
	<b>WASHINGTON, SEPT. 7, 1995 </b>-- New Jersey's "family cap" policy -- which denies increases in cash welfare benefits to single mothers who have additional children while already receiving welfare -- has resulted in a significant decline in out-of-wedlock births with no corresponding increase in abortions.<p>
	According to Heritage Foundation welfare analyst Robert Rector, the evidence from New Jersey indicates that in the 16 months after the cap went into effect, there was an average decrease in out-of-wedlock births of 10 percent. This, even though the average decrease in benefits came to just 4 percent of the monthly Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) benefits received by the typical welfare mother. There was no statistically significant corresponding increase in abortions, according to Rector, who obtained his information from New Jersey's Department of Human Services in Trenton.<p>
	"The New Jersey data show why Congress should consider imposing a similar cap on benefits to welfare mothers who have additional children as part of an overall welfare-reform strategy for reducing illegitimacy," says Rector, Heritage's senior analyst for welfare and family issues.<p>
	The family cap went into effect in October of 1992, and gave affected mothers -- those already enrolled in AFDC -- a 10-month grace period, meaning the limit on benefits applied only those who bore children after July 1993.    <p>     
	"In the year before the cap, the average monthly number of births was 1,331; in the 16 months after the cap went into effect, average monthly births among AFDC mothers fell to 1,197. The cap appears to have caused an average decrease of 134 births per month, or 10 percent," Rector concludes.<p>	
	"Critics claim that the family cap has not caused an actual decrease in the number of illegitimate births, but merely a delay in welfare mothers reporting births to the welfare office," Rector says. "But mothers on AFDC in New Jersey still have a huge economic incentive -- in the form of an increase in food stamp and Medicaid benefits for each additional child born -- to notify the welfare department of a childbirth." Moreover, Rector says the official data from New Jersey are adjusted to include births reported late, and still show a decline in illegitimacy.<p>
	Rector says previously reported data leaked to the press by scholars at Rutgers University -- data that supposedly showed no decrease in out-of-wedlock births as a result of New Jersey's policy -- were not conclusive. Rector points out that the Rutgers scholars have yet to finish their evaluation, have yet to issue an official report, and that their study did not, in fact, show zero effect on out-of-wedlock births. "In fact, the Rutgers analysis shows a lower rate of out-of-wedlock births after the cap went into effect," says Rector.<p>

<center><h2>HOUSE FARM BILL A "GOOD FIRST STEP"<br>
 BUT MORE NEEDED, ANALYST SAYS</h2><br></center><br>
Contact: Heritage Public Relations<br><br>
<h4>Study Projects $135 Billion Economic
Boost From  Phasing Out Farm Programs</h4><br><br>
<b>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</b>	<br><br>
<b>WASHINGTON, SEPT. 6, 1995 </b>-- House Agriculture Committee Chairman Rep. Pat Roberts' farm reform bill is "a good first step" but the Kansas Republican's proposal needs major changes to achieve real benefits for American farmers and consumers, according to a Heritage Foundation analyst.<p>
	In a paper released today, John Frydenlund, director of Heritage's Agricultural Policy Project, says the bill -- which is scheduled for markup by the House Agriculture Committee September 13-15 -- needs a definite date when current farm programs and payments will end. The termination date should be in five years, Frydenlund says, not the seven suggested by the Roberts bill.<p>
	Nevertheless, he says, the Roberts bill, if implemented, would "significantly enhance the opportunity for farmers to meet the growing demands of the world marketplace." By extricating America's farmers from bureaucratic planting requirements, the bill would "allow farmers to produce to meet domestic consumer demand rather than to satisfy the dictates of the federal government," says Frydenlund.<p>
	Roberts' "Freedom to Farm Act" eliminates supply-control programs such as the Acreage Reduction Program, ends the Farmer-Owned Reserve for excess crop production, and replaces current target and deficiency payments with a new seven-year system of declining transitional payments, Frydenlund says.<p>
	But he believes the bill can work only if it locks in a deadline for phasing out these programs. "While Roberts' bill locks in fixed declining payments to farmers for the next seven years, there is no guarantee that these payments will cease at the end of the seven years," Frydenlund says. "The result could be buying a few years of time under the guise of real reform, only to slip back to the status quo when reducing the federal budget is no longer a top priority in Congress. In future years, supporters of centrally planned agriculture could point to any slight downturn in prices or land values as justification for a return to the current system of government controls," he says.<p>
	 The Roberts bill also should be changed to cap the transition payments for particular crops to prevent their "becoming an exorbitant windfall" if prices soar before the end of the phaseout period, and to "eliminate or at least drastically reduce" the Conservation Reserve Program, which keeps up to 36 million acres of otherwise productive land idled, Frydenlund says.<p>
	Finally, Frydenlund believes Congress should impose a spending cap on the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) program and limit its borrowing authority. Under the current CCC,  there is little to constrain the Secretary of Agriculture's ability to "spend whatever is necessary regardless of what has been provided by Congress in budget authority" on deficiency payments to wheat, feed grains, cotton and rice producers.<p>
	"Not only does open-ended borrowing authority mean there is no real limit to potential farm program spending at present, but this nearly unlimited source of funds also allows the Secretary to raid CCC to cover mismanagement of other farm programs," Frydenlund says.<p>
	In a related Heritage study to be released later this week, Frydenlund and Heritage Senior Fellow for Statistical Policy Analysis David Winston conclude that the nation's economy would expand by nearly $135 billion within a decade as a result of ending the current farm program.<p>
	The study measures the "multiplier effect" on the economy that would result as farmers increase production, earn higher incomes through expanded exports, and generate new economic activity in farm-related industries such as equipment manufacturing, fertilizer, seed, livestock feed, food processing, transportation and shipping.<p>
	"In a 10-year period, the overall economy would expand by $134.9 billion, with every state contributing to the expanded economy. Every single state will win under this plan," Frydenlund and Winston say.<p>
	Their conclusion was based on data generated by an econometric computer model developed by Heritage for the think tank's report, "Freeing America's Farmers: The Heritage Plan for Rural Prosperity." That plan -- which proposed phasing out all federal farm programs by the year 2001 -- was made public earlier this year.<p>
	"In fact, the nation's economy would expand by $10.9 billion just in the first year, and this is a conservative estimate," according to Frydenlund and Winston.<p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Virtually from the beginning of government in human society, death and taxes have been closely linked as well as inevitable. The passing of well-to-do individuals has been a lucrative moment for tax collectors. Most nations today impose death, estate, and inheritance taxes, and the United States is no exception.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This ancient practice, however, is beginning to change. Motivated by mounting evidence that death-related taxes may hold back the economic well-being of the living, several countries and American states recently have repealed their taxes on estates or significantly scaled them down. The U.S. Congress also is reexamining the wisdom of these taxes. Two bills, one in the House and another in the Senate, call for outright repeal of the estate and gift tax,<sup>1</sup> and dozens of others in both chambers propose significant modifications that give taxpayer relief.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Support for these proposals still comes primarily from advocates of limited government. But a growing number of liberals recently have shown a keen interest in repeal. Like so many critics of the estate tax, these new critics are disturbed by the growing evidence that this tax:
<ul>
<p><li>Reduces economic growth, hurting the jobs and incomes of the very people that wealth redistribution was intended to aid;

<p><li>Increases the cost of capital, slowing down research and development and the use of machines that would increase worker productivity -- and thus wages;

<p><li>Keeps interest rates on home loans and other major purchases higher than they should be; and

<p><li>Raises very little money -- in fact, it may cost the government and the taxpayers more in administrative and compliance fees than it raises in revenue.
</ul><p>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Current wealth taxation policy stems from the mistaken view that redistributing income leads to the redistribution of economic power. Nearly a century of wealth taxation, however, shows that well-to-do Americans (including a great number of middle-class families) simply find ways of legally avoiding the tax collector. Not only do they save less and consume more of their income, thus benefiting from the lower taxes on consumption, but they also make less productive investments, such as large life insurance policies and substantial charitable contributions, thus reducing the chances that their death will leave a large taxable estate. The policy of using the estate tax to redistribute economic power actually leads to a distorted distribution of consumption and a less productive economy. Both of these unexpected outcomes worsen the economic condition of the less economically powerful.
<p>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Founders understood the critical importance of reducing legal barriers to economic opportunity as the best public means of allowing every citizen to achieve economic fulfillment. This understanding found a home in the original U.S. Constitution, where direct taxes on wealth and income were prohibited except in time of national emergency. But soon after the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment (which lifted the ban on federal income taxation) in 1913, the federal government began a 60-year effort to create a more democratic economy through the forcible redistribution of wealth. That policy has imposed costs on economic growth as well as fundamental liberties.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is time to repeal the estate, gift, and generation-skipping tax. The case for this turns on three factors: the diminishing importance of the estate tax as a federal revenue stream; the failure of the tax to achieve its public policy objectives, principally the creation of economic benefits for lower-income Americans; and the continuing damage the tax exacts on the economy in terms of jobs, output, and growth. Transcending all of these factors is the growing appreciation that wealth taxation infringes on fundamental liberties and is inconsistent with the principle of limited government.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If the estate tax were repealed, the effect on the economy would be significant. According to an econometric study conducted by Professor Richard Wagner of George Mason University, the effect of the estate tax on the cost of capital is so great that within eight years, a U.S. economy without an estate tax would be producing $80 billion more in annual output and would have created 250,000 additional jobs and a $640 billion larger capital stock.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;An analysis by The Heritage Foundation using two leading econometric models also found that repealing the estate tax would have a large and beneficial effect on the economy. Specifically, the Heritage analysis found that if the tax were repealed this year, over the next nine years:
<ul>
<p><li>The nation's economy would average as much as $11 billion per year in extra output;

<p><li>An average of 145,000 additional new jobs could be created;

<p><li>Personal income could rise by an average of $8 billion per year above current projections; and

<p><li>The deficit actually would decline, since revenues generated by extra growth would more than compensate for the meager revenues currently raised by the inefficient estate tax.
The estate tax has few friends, other than tax attorneys, and raises very little revenue at a heavy cost to the economy. It generates complex tax avoidance schemes. The hardest hit by the tax are small businesspeople who work hard to pass on an enterprise of value to their children. And its bias against saving and wealth generation is the antithesis of the American dream.
</ul><p>

<b>HOW WEALTH TAXES BEGAN IN AMERICA</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Current public policy on the taxation of intergenerational wealth stems from roots laid down in the American Revolution and, oddly enough, in the Revolutionaries' efforts to create a society in which all citizens would be free to become as wealthy as their talents allow. As with so many principles that trace back to the Revolutionary period, the liberty to acquire and dispose of personal property became, by the 20th century, subsidiary to another element of the country's founding: the drive to create democratic equality of economic opportunity.<sup>2</sup><p><b>The Early Years</b><p>Alexis de Tocqueville paid considerable attention to the views Americans held about wealth and economic opportunity when he made his famous tour of the early Republic in 1831. On the one hand, Americans had a nearly universal disdain for aristocracy and any non-republican show of wealth. But on the other hand, nearly everyone with whom Tocqueville became acquainted wanted desperately to be rich:
<blockquote>
	I do not mean that there is any lack of wealthy individuals in the United States; I know of no country, indeed, where the love of money has taken stronger hold on the affections of men and where a profounder contempt is expressed for the theory of the permanent equality of property. But wealth circulates with inconceivable rapidity, and experience shows that it is rare to find two succeeding generations in the full enjoyment of it.<sup>3</sup></blockquote><b>Removing Barriers to Wealth.</b> The democratization of acquiring wealth constituted the touchstone of the new civilization that the Revolutionaries sought to build. Theirs was a battle against barriers erected in the Old World to prevent the rise of the common man. For centuries, laws had been applied differently to rich and poor people. The Revolutionaries overturned this by embracing the legal principle of equality before the law, extending it to all free Americans, and giving it the sharp legal teeth of natural liberty in one's life and property. They freed labor and capital from taxes, turned over to communities virtually all regulation of commerce, and tried in many other ways to remove government from everyday life. This truly was the age of the individual. Liberated from the oppressive economic and social networks that had surrounded the Crown and that prevented ordinary people from rising, the Revolutionaries emphasized the importance of allowing the marketplace rather than birth and influence to be the measure of personal worth. As Gordon Wood writes in his Pulitzer Prize-winning history of this period,
<blockquote>
	A man was now praised for having arrived and risen "without friends," for having been "the architect of his own fortune," or for never having been "borne on the shoulders of patronage."  For many Americans the ability to make money -- not whom one knew, or who one's father was, or where one went to college -- now became the only proper democratic means for distinguishing one man from another.<sup>4</sup></blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Nothing epitomizes the zeal of the Revolutionaries for fundamentally altering the process of acquiring wealth better than the rapid abolition of primogeniture and the narrowing of entail. The ancient practice of primogeniture settled the entirety of an estate on the first-born male, thus leaving the remaining male children and all female children without inheritance. Primogeniture made birth order rather than merit the principal cause of wealth. Thus, dullards were as likely as commercial geniuses to end up ruling vast properties and exercising immense social and political influence. Entail nicely complemented primogeniture by making it all but impossible for real estate to leave a family, no matter how desirous a family one day might be to part with the property or how badly they managed their estate. Together, primogeniture and entail put a gigantic weight around the neck of economic progress and reduced the rate of commercial improvement to an obese creep.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Thomas Jefferson, himself initially a victim of primogeniture and then its beneficiary upon the death of his older brother, vigorously opposed both practices and saw legislation that he had written in 1777 abolishing primogeniture passed by the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1785. Within a few years, every new state government had followed Virginia's lead, and no subsequent state ever seriously considered allowing it. For Jefferson, the reform of entail and abolition of primogeniture were two of the most important actions taken in the early Republic to create "a system by which every fibre would be eradicated of ancient or future aristocracy, and a foundation laid for a government truly republican."<sup>5</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even a cursory reading of the Revolutionary texts underscores this unrelenting focus of the Founders on removing barriers to the wealth-creating process. Early American public policy was not aimed at redistributing wealth or at restraining its growth. Rather, the early Republic pursued a public policy of removing obstacles to entrepreneurship and economic self-improvement. If an egalitarian theme was present in early American public policy, it was the theme of equality before the law, which often meant the elimination of legal privileges that gave one class an economic advantage over another.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This attitude to wealth creation can be found in the Constitution of the United States. A straightforward reading of the following paragraph from Article I, Section 9 appears to prohibit all direct taxes, which would include a prohibition against taxes on income and wealth: "No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken."<sup>6</sup><p><b>Changing Attitudes Toward Wealth and Taxation</b><p><b>National Emergencies.</b> It was generally accepted during the 19th century that Congress had extensive authority to bend the Constitution during times of national emergency. For example, the writ of <I>habeas corpus</i> could be suspended in times of war or rebellion in order to advance the public good. Thus, it appeared well within Congress's emergency powers to impose taxes on wealth and inheritance to meet the wholly unexpected revenue requirements of the federal government during dangerous times.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Congress wasted no time in testing its expansive wartime authority: Taxes on estates were imposed first during the Quasi-War with France (1797-1799), but repealed in 1802. Still, had it not been for the Civil War, it is possible that after 1802, the 19th century would have been an uninterrupted period of no estate or intergenerational wealth taxation. But the expenses of the Union government exhausted its revenue sources so quickly that President Lincoln and the war Congresses employed the emergency clauses of the Constitution to enact the first modern intergenerational wealth tax. The Revenue Act of 1862 revived the death tax of the Quasi-War Congress and recrafted it into a true inheritance tax. Congress repealed the tax on wealth in 1870.<sup>7</sup><p><b>Wealth Seen As an Obstacle to Economic Opportunity.</b> While costly national emergencies occasionally challenged the idea of unrestricted wealth creation and ownership, more important in the long run was a change of attitude in some circles toward the relationship between wealth and economic opportunity. Between 1880 and 1916, the party of Lincoln overflowed with political warriors who saw no American problem that could not be solved by righteous citizens wielding the policy tools of the newly powerful federal government. Just as they had overcome the Southern assertion of states' rights, they would be victorious over the growing concentrations of private economic power that they viewed as fundamentally threatening the bedrock American value of equal economic opportunity.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The reform Republicans created many tools for achieving their "new economic democracy," but perhaps none was so important to this project as the income tax. If the principal post-war threat to the Republic came from the great wealth that industrialization created for a few privileged people, and from the opportunities this wealth provided for corrupting political institutions, reformers needed above all else a legal means of redistributing wealth, thus diffusing the political power that great wealth provided. In 1894, Congress took its first tentative step in this direction by passing the Income Tax Act. Significantly, the heart of the Act was a definition of gifts and inheritances as income.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Supreme Court wasted little time in striking down the Income Tax Act. In 1895, the Court ruled<sup>8</sup> that the Act constituted a direct tax on certain forms of income that did not meet the Constitution's requirement of apportioning such a tax according to population. Without a change in the Constitution, the Court concluded, all such efforts at taxing income would fail to pass constitutional review.<p>The constitutional obstacle was removed in 1913 with ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment.<sup>9</sup>  Congress quickly passed an income tax in 1914 that levied a 3 percent rate on all incomes above $30,000 (about $900,000 in 1996 dollars).<sup>10</sup>  It then launched the modern period of estate and gift taxation through the Revenue Act of 1916.<p>The Revenue Act of 1916 established rules for valuing a decedent's estate, for capturing taxable lifetime transfers into the estate, and for determining those transfers made for inadequate consideration and those that became effective only upon death. It created exemptions and deductions that continue to be a part of estate tax law today. Most important, the Act introduced progressive taxation into estate tax policy.<sup>11</sup>  This element clearly distinguished its public policy objective from earlier death taxes: The central mission of federal estate and gift taxation would be the redistribution of wealth.<sup>12</sup><p>After 1916, and despite a few efforts to retreat from estate and gift taxation immediately following World War I, taxes on intergenerational wealth transfers became a permanent feature of U.S. tax policy.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The history of wealth transfer taxation between 1920 and 1976 consisted largely of expanding the tax base for estate and gift taxes and increasing the tax rates. Congress raised the top marginal rate for estate taxes to 40 percent in 1924. In 1932, the top rate rose to 45 percent and the gift tax became permanent. The imminence of hostilities in 1941 caused Congress to search for additional revenues and led to a further increase in the top rate on estates to 77 percent.<sup>13</sup><p>Figure 1 shows the rapid increase in estate and gift tax collections after the end of World War II. Intergenerational taxes grew significantly in both amount and rate, even when adjusted for inflation. This growth probably stemmed as much from the demographics of the transfer taxes as from high tax rates: The late 1960s saw the beginning of generational transfers from those Americans who had weathered the storms of depression and world war. Transfers increasingly consisted of small businesses and farms as well as stocks, bonds, and liquid assets. And as the number of taxable estates containing businesses grew, so did the pressure for estate tax relief.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Congress recognized in 1976 that a tax intended to diminish the power of great wealth more frequently ended up taxing ordinary Americans who had accumulated taxable estates through nothing more than frugality, entrepreneurship, and plain hard work. The Tax Reform Act of 1976 addressed the concerns of these people through a number of policy changes. Specifically, the Act:
<ul>
<p><li>Unified the estate and gift tax, enabling taxpayers to apply unused gift tax allowances as deductions against their taxable estates;

<p><li>Lowered the top marginal rate to 70 percent and expanded the marital deductions for estates of moderate size; and

<p><li>Created special rules for estates consisting primarily of small businesses and family farms that allowed more of these entities to escape estate taxes altogether.<sup>14</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Congress's eagerness in 1976 to address problems with intergenerational taxation coincided with a growing understanding among many academics and politicians that high tax rates retard economic growth.<sup>15</sup>  This growing awareness led the Congresses of the 1980s to reduce the economic influence of intergenerational taxes, largely through tax cuts and more generous deductions. The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 in particular reflected this redirection in public policy. For example, the Act created the unified credit that currently exempts the first $600,000 in an otherwise taxable estate from any tax liability,<sup>16</sup> and it cut the top marginal rate from 70 percent to 50 percent. In addition, the Act further liberalized the rules governing the tax valuation of closely held businesses and farms, and lengthened the period of time for the payment of estate taxes by estates that contain such businesses.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

With few exceptions, tax and budget bills passed between 1981 and 1992 adhered to the policy changes contained in the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981.<sup>17</sup>  Even in the largest tax increase in U.S. history -- the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993 -- it was apparent that revenue goals and not class warfare was the basis of the wealth tax provision. While Congress added two new rates (53 percent and 55 percent) to the estate and gift tax, these still did not go above Ronald Reagan's top rate. And while two new income tax rates (35 percent and 39.6 percent) were enacted, they still were just over half as high as the nearly confiscatory rates that prevailed during the administration of Dwight Eisenhower. In fact, without notice, wealth transfer tax policy has lost its ideological thrust. Its philosophical justification is disappearing; its roots in public policy are growing shorter every year; and its retention depends on its value as a revenue-raiser. But as we shall see later, besides its damaging impact on wealth creation and economic well-being, as a source of revenue it is more trouble than it is worth.<sup>18</sup><p><b>THE ESTATE AND GIFT TAX TODAY</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Current federal wealth transfer law is a confusing maze through which only the bravest taxpayers will travel without an experienced guide. The federal government taxes intergenerational wealth transfers through the estate, gift, and generation-skipping tax systems.<sup>19</sup><p>

<b>The Estate Tax</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The largest component of the federal government's three-part wealth taxation system is the estate tax. Current estate tax law itself has three basic elements: 1) definition of the estate tax base, or the gross estate of a decedent; 2) deductions that can be made from the gross estate to arrive at the taxable estate; and 3) the computation of estate tax liability.
<ol>
	<p><li><b>The Tax Base</b><p><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Estate tax law defines the gross estate of a decedent as the "fair market value"<sup>20</sup> of all personal or real property, wherever situated and however tangible, at the time of the decedent's death.<sup>21</sup>  This valuation of an estate's property attempts to quantify such property at its "highest and best use."  However, the valuation of a business or a farm on a "fair market value" standard may actually result in an artificially low value of an ongoing enterprise. For example, consider a start-up business in a good part of town. The owner suddenly dies, and his son wants to continue the business. If the estate tax value is determined by recent sales of other businesses located near it, then it may be valued at an amount well above its actual worth based on the cash generated by the business (which may even be operating at a loss in this early phase). This makes a big difference to an estate, since the business may have to be sold in order to pay the estate tax because the son is unable to raise a loan to pay the tax. In 1976, Congress recognized this negative potential of the "fair market value" rule and permitted estates containing small businesses and farms to be valued at their present use rather than at their "market value."<sup>22</sup><ul><p><li><b>Insurance Policies.</b> Special rules apply to the value of insurance policies contained in the decedent's estate. If the life insurance policy is paid out to benefit the estate, of if the decedent either held a property right in the policy or conveyed this property right within three years of death, then the value of the policy is added to the gross estate. A similar rule applies to annuities.<sup>23</sup><p><li><b>Joint Property.</b> A property rights rule also applies to property owned jointly by the decedent and someone other than the decedent's spouse: Such jointly owned property is included in the gross estate to the extent of the ratio of consideration furnished. With respect to property owned jointly with a surviving spouse, only 50 perc
ent of such property becomes a part of the gross estate.<sup>24</sup><p><li><b>Gifts.</b> Gifts and other transfers of property made by the decedent well before death also may be included in the gross estate if the decedent retained the ability to influence the disposition and use of such property. Similar inclusion in the gross estate applies to gifts that occur only upon death. However, sales of property and other alienation of property from the decedent's control made throughout his or her life are not included in gross estate.</ul>	

<p><li><b>Deductions</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Once the total value of an estate has been calculated, numerous deductions may be applied. The result of these subtractions from the gross estate is the taxable estate.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	
The first category of deductions relates to direct expenses of the estate: All costs of the funeral, of legal claims against the estate, of the executor's administration of the estate, and of mortgages paid by the estate may be deducted.<sup>25</sup>  Second, the value of property passing to the decedent's surviving spouse may be deducted. Finally, the estate may deduct the value of all charitable bequests to organizations recognized by the federal government as tax-exempt.

<p><li><b>Tax Liability</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The taxable estate that results from the application of these gross estate deductions is taxed according to a somewhat cumbersome four-step process. First, the value of all taxable gifts made over the decedent's lifetime is added to the net estate. Second, a before-credits tax is calculated by multiplying this "grossed up" estate by the relevant tax rate. Third, this before-credits tax is reduced by subtracting the tax on all gifts made after 1976. And fourth, various credits are applied to the remaining sum.<sup>26</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are four credits available for estate tax reduction, but by far the most significant is the unified transfer tax credit.<sup>27</sup>  This credit is a flat $192,800, which equates to a $600,000 net taxable estate. Thus, the unified transfer tax credit means that current law exempts from taxation all otherwise taxable estates up to $600,000 in value.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Above $600,000, estates face a tax rate table that contains no fewer than 17 different rates, ranging from 18 percent to 55 percent. There is a 5 percent surcharge for estates between $10,000,000 and $21,040,000, intended to phase out the unified transfer credit. Thus, estates up to $21 million in value face a 60 percent marginal rate.<sup>28</sup></ol><p><b>The Gift Tax</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second layer of federal wealth transfer taxation is the levy made on lifetime property gifts. Like the definition of gross estate, current law contains a host of decisions that the courts and executors must make in determining the value of taxable gifts.<ol>	<p><li><b>The Tax Base.</b> <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps the most difficult decision of all is the one that must be made first: determining the value of the decedent's lifetime giving. This difficulty arises on two fronts:
<ul><p><li>
<b>First,</b> a gift is the transfer of property for something less than full legal consideration to a party generally within the donor's family. On the one hand, the executor must determine which gift transfers meet the test of insufficient legal consideration. On the other hand, the executor must distinguish gifts made for income tax purposes that require "detached and disinterested generosity" from those that qualify for the gift tax.<sup>29</sup><p><li><b>Second,</b> the executor or the court must wrestle with the question of "fair market value."  The federal gift tax requires that <i>all</i> wealth transfers made as gifts over the decedent's entire life be valued for taxation. That means, incredibly, that appraisals of value must be made for gifts made decades before the decedent's death. Moreover, these gifts must be appraised in terms of their "fair market value" at the time they were made, which is a task that often stretches the frontiers of property appraisal to its breaking point.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Such extraordinary efforts at valuation and record reconstruction must be made in order to determine whether the annual level of gift giving exceeded the allowed limits. An estate may exclude from the gift tax base all annual present interest gift transfers of $10,000 or less per donee.<sup>30</sup>  But if the donor made the gift to meet the donee's tuition or medical expenses, the limit does not apply. Furthermore, if the donor's spouse elects to make a similar gift to the same donee (a practice known as gift-splitting), the annual limit rises to $20,000. All gifts above these limits become part of the gift tax base.

	<p><li><b>Deductions.</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 

Like the estate tax base, the gift tax base can be reduced by certain deductions. Besides gift-splitting, certain gifts to one's spouse may be deducted. Also, gifts to charities recognized by the IRS as tax-exempt organizations can be deducted from the gift tax base.<sup>31</sup>  Finally, special rules apply to the division of property in a divorce or separation, and this leads to more gift tax deductions.<sup>32</sup>	<p><li><b>Tax Liability.</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Computing the amount of gift tax is relatively simple. First, taxable gifts for the current and all previous calendar years are summed and taxed using the tax rate table for estates. Second, this total amount of gift tax then is reduced by any unused unified transfer tax credit.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To illustrate, suppose that a married couple gave their only child $10,000 a year for a period of 20 years, for a cumulative total of $200,000. These gifts equal the maximum annual amount that taxpayers may exclude from the federal gift tax base. However, for four years this couple made additional gifts to their child of $100,000 a year, for a total of $400,000. This latter amount is above the limit and is taxable. Now suppose that the gross taxable estate of this couple equals $1,000,000, which includes the taxable gifts. The executor of the estate will use the unified credit of $600,000 to reduce the taxable amount and will pay taxes on the remaining $400,000, or the additional gifts the couple gave their child.
</ol><p>

<b>The Generation-Skipping Tax</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Wealth transfer taxes have been so consistently high throughout this century that a substantial cottage industry devoted to estate tax avoidance has blossomed within the legal and financial communities. One of their cleverest inventions was a trust established by a parent for the lifetime benefit of his or her children that passed tax-free to the parent's grandchildren upon the parent's death (or bypassed the children completely and went directly to the grandchildren). The trust avoided estate taxes altogether because such taxes are never levied on amounts that cannot be controlled by the taxpayer. However, some trusts were designed to pay out to the grandchildren upon the death of the taxpayer's children. Thus, the taxpayer could target specific individuals to receive benefits from the estate if the taxpayer could skip a generation through the creative use of a tax-free trust.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress enacted a cumbersome tax law change in 1976 to close the indirect generation-skipping transfer, but it left unaddressed the trust or bequest that directly skipped the parent's children. Both of these loopholes were addressed by Congress in 1986. As part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Congress established a flat-rate tax of 55 percent on all generation-skipping transfers. Transfers subject to the tax are those made from a trust to a "skip person" (someone two or more generations removed from the donor); those made by a donor directly to a "skip person" without going through a trust; and those that result from termination of an interest in a property or trust, which usually happens upon the death of the donor.<sup>33</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As with the estate tax and the gift tax, several exclusions and exemptions apply. The same $10,000 annual exclusion and tuition and medical exemptions found in the gift tax law apply to generation-skipping taxes. A total lifetime exclusion of $1,000,000 ($2,000,000 for married couples) is allowed. Finally, transfers made prior to January 1, 1990, are exempt up to $2,000,000 ($4,000,000 for married couples).<sup>34</sup><p><b>THE LIBERAL CASE FOR REPEALING THE ESTATE TAX</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This complex tax edifice rests on the foundation that taxing intergenerational wealth transfers results in less concentrated wealth holdings and that this leads in turn to greater economic opportunity and a more democratic society. Certainly simplicity cannot be raised in support of this tax policy, as the above discussion indicates. And, as Figures 1 and 2 show, the estate and gift tax cannot be justified as playing an important role in financing government: The unified estate and gift tax now brings in less than 1.7 percent of total federal revenues.
<p>

<b>The Liberal Egalitarian Argument for Intergenerational Wealth Taxation</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The case for the estate tax turns on the tax's effectiveness in achieving greater economic democracy through the redistribution of wealth. If its supporters cannot sustain the argument that the estate tax improves equality of economic opportunity, then there exists little else (except perhaps inertia) to recommend continuation of this part of U.S. tax policy. Other, simpler taxes could meet revenue objectives far more efficiently.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Academic support for intergenerational wealth taxation remains warm, in large part because of the role it plays in the most important theoretical treatise on liberal egalitarianism, John Rawls's <i>A Theory of Justice.</i><sup>35</sup>  Since its publication in 1971, this careful, magisterial presentation of the case for liberal democracy infused with just institutions has permeated thinking on most issues in social and political theory. It is fair to say that no stronger theoretical case for intergenerational wealth taxation exists.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

At the center of Rawls's case for wealth taxation is the principle that "[a]ll social primary goods -- liberty and opportunity, income and wealth, and the bases of self-respect -- are to be distributed equally unless an unequal distribution of any or all of these goods is to the advantage of the least favored."<sup>36</sup>  While at first blush this principle would appear to suggest radical egalitarianism in economic and political life, Rawls recognizes the superiority of "free" over socialized markets to produce benefits for the least advantaged citizens, which leads him and many like-minded political theorists to support significant differences in the economic conditions of individuals within a generation. After a century of economic experimentation, there can be little doubt that everyone achieves greater economic benefit when individuals are allowed to discover their own comparative advantage and focus their labor in the area where they can make the greatest economic difference.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This tolerance for intragenerational differences leads Rawls to oppose all income taxes, since economic income stems from natural differences in talent and from differing propensities of individuals to apply themselves to hard work.<sup>37</sup>  However, two principled considerations compel Rawls to take substantial exception to intergenerational differences in economic condition.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<b>First,</b> Rawls opposes the transfer of accumulated property to succeeding generations because it undermines the first principle of a just society: that everyone has "an equal right to the most extensive total system of equal basic liberties compatible with a similar system of liberty for all."<sup>38</sup>  Those who begin with a significant unearned endowment of property resources place others not so advantaged in a less equal condition, and this undermines the principle that everyone should have access to the same system of equal basic liberties.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<b>Second,</b> this difference might be tolerated if it produced greater benefits for the least advantaged than for the advantaged. However, intergenerational wealth transfers create benefits that flow in the opposite direction: Over time, they enhance the advantages of inheriting generations and generally degrade the liberties of the unbenefitted. Thus, "[t]he taxation of inheritance and income at progressive rates (when necessary), and the legal definition of property rights, are to secure the institutions of equal liberty in a property-owning democracy and the fair value of the rights they establish."<sup>39</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;While Rawls does not advance confiscatory taxation of intergenerational wealth transfers, his argument does imply substantial taxing discretion by the state. In his universe, the state guides the institutions of distribution; should government determine that wealth transfers constitute significant barriers to the equal enjoyment of liberties (as defined by Rawls), it clearly has the power to tax away as much of the wealth that moves between generations as it deems necessary to restore justice.

<p>
<b>Objections to the Liberal Egalitarian Case for the Estate Tax</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A number of objections could be raised against the Rawlsian case for wealth transfer taxation, not the least of them being the questionable assertion of government authority over the intergenerational disposition of private property. If wealth is acquired legally and transferred peacefully (that is, in some non-tortious fashion that breaches no contract pertaining to the property), government has no ethical standing to interfere with its disposition.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Of course, liberal egalitarians claim a more expansive role for government, a principal element of which is the progressive enhancement of equality of condition among citizens. Thus, it is important first to consider the estate tax within the context of the argument that justifies the tax's existence. If it can be shown that the estate tax does not advance the ethical program of the liberal egalitarians, then other objections to this tax that can be raised without assuming this ethical and moral framework become more compelling.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This approach to analyzing the estate tax was taken in a seminal monograph by Edward J. McCaffery published in <i>The Yale Law Journal</i> in 1994.<sup>40</sup>  Professor McCaffery comes to the debate over the estate tax with impeccable political credentials. Unlike many critics of intergenerational taxation who frame their objections within a larger, politically conservative analysis of contemporary government, MaCaffery formulated his critique of the estate tax within a liberal framework. As he stated last year before the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance:<blockquote>	I am an unrequited liberal, in both the classical and contemporary political senses of that word, whose views on social and distributive justice might best be described as progressive. I used to believe in the gift and estate tax as a vehicle for obtaining justice. As to the latter belief, only, I am now prepared to confess that I "was blind, but now can see."<sup>41</sup></blockquote><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;McCaffery raises five general objections to the liberal egalitarian argument supporting intergenerational wealth taxation. Each of them assumes the ethical and moral objectives of the liberal political program.
<ol>
<p><li><b>The currently combined income and estate tax system encourages large <i>inter vivos</i> gift transfers, which have the effect of creating a greater inequality of starting points or a less level economic playing field.</b> This predictable effect of the estate tax law is aggravated further by the fact that high estate tax rates encourage the consumption rather than the transfer of wealth. Purchasing goods and services instead of saving the funds that support that consumption produces larger differences between rich and poor people. Thus, the estate tax is illiberal because it undermines rather than advances the liberal egalitarian objective of equality of economic opportunity.

<p><li><b>While higher wealth transfer taxes might reduce the level of <i>inter vivos</i> gifts, and other tax law changes could be made to penalize the spending behavior of rich families, it currently is both practically and politically impossible to do so.</b> On the one hand, analysts are becoming increasingly aware of the intergenerational focus of much current saving behavior at all income levels. Liberals should promote the creation of transferable wealth among the less advantaged. On the other hand, politicians are becoming increasingly aware of how much voters want taxes to fall, not rise. The estate or inheritance tax has been repealed in Australia, Canada, Israel, and California; and the movement for tax reform is a spreading, worldwide movement.
<p>
<p><li><b>There will always be differences between the starting conditions of people in a non-ideal world.</b> If liberal egalitarians attempted to eliminate all the differences that stem from intergenerational wealth transfers, they would risk leaving the least advantaged even worse off than they were before. Not only would confiscatory taxation reduce the consumption behavior of wealthy people, thereby also reducing employment and incomes among poorer citizens, but it would depress the amount of economic capital as well, thereby reducing economic expansion and income growth, both of which are central to improving the conditions of the least advantaged.
<p>
<p><li><b>"[It] is the use and not the mere concentration of wealth that threatens reasonable liberal values."</b><sup>42</sup>  Generally speaking, the accumulation of savings and the promotion of earnings that underlie the growth of savings are "goods" that liberals like. Earnings and savings create a "common pool" of resources that can be used to promote improvements in the general welfare through public and private means. Liberals generally regard the consumption behavior of the wealthy as objectionable; thus, wealth transfer taxation, which attacks savings and promotes wanton consumption, is wholly ill-suited to the attainment of an ideal liberal society.

<p><li><b>The best tax policy that liberal egalitarians could pursue, if attaining liberal social and political objectives truly motivates the liberal program, is one that taxes consumption, not savings.</b> McCaffery writes that:<blockquote>

	[b]y getting our reasonable political judgments wrong -- by taxing work and savings while condoning, even encouraging large-scale use [consumption] -- the status quo impedes the liberal project....  The real threats to liberty and equality from private possession alone turn out, on closer scrutiny, to relate to possession <i>qua</i> potential or actual use, each of which can be addressed -- indeed, can <i>best</i> be addressed -- in a tax system without an estate tax.<sup>43</sup>
</ol><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Not only, then, is the estate tax inconsistent with a liberal program of promoting equality of economic condition, but it encourages behavior that works against liberal objectives. It supports consumption and depletion by penalizing savings and earnings. It encourages the kind of strange world where it costs less for a millionaire like Steve Forbes to spend $30 million of his own money on a presidential campaign than to save $30 million for his children's future -- an investment upon which he will pay a 55 percent transfer tax as opposed to a campaign expenditure upon which no additional taxes are ever levied. How many new jobs and new businesses did Mr. Forbes's campaign create as opposed to the same amount saved in a bank that lends the funds to entrepreneurs and business managers?  Liberals and conservatives are beginning to answer this question in precisely the same way.
</ol>
<b>Few Friends.</b> The weaknesses of the estate and income tax system as a tool for redistribution long have been known, even to its academic friends. Joseph Stiglitz, who now serves as the Chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, concluded in 1978 that the estate tax effectively transfers resources from the saver to the spender, which, absent any offsetting tax policy change, reduces the stock of capital and leads to lower levels of national wealth.<sup>44</sup>  Furthermore, wrote Stiglitz,
<blockquote>
	because of capital accumulation effects, the estate tax may not achieve the objective to which it is presumably directed, that is, equalizing the distribution of income; if the government takes actions to offset these accumulation effects, the tax will lead to an increase in equality of income and wealth. The desirability of the estate tax may still be questioned, not only because of the distortions which it introduces but also because it may actually increase inequality in the distribution of consumption.<sup>45</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Alan Blinder, another member of the President's initial Council of Economic Advisers and subsequently Vice-Chairman of the Federal Reserve System's Board of Governors, also has raised serious doubts about the redistributional promises of the estate tax.<sup>46</sup>  He has been joined by Michael Boskin, Martin Feldstein, Gary Becker, Laurence Kotlikoff, Lawrence Summers, and many other economists with prominent connections to mainstream economics.<sup>47</sup>


<p><b>THE ECONOMIC CASE AGAINST THE ESTATE TAX</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In addition to the Left's declining enthusiasm for the ideology of wealth taxes, two economic issues have added to the momentum for repeal. One is the mounting weight of economic and financial evidence against the estate and gift tax as such. The other is the rapidly spreading general view that income taxes and the multiple taxation of savings reduce economic growth, which in turn slows the rate of economic improvement by the least advantaged. Among the economic problems associated with the tax:
<ul>
<p><li><b>The estate tax raises little money and encourages inefficient tax-avoidance schemes.</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
Bolstering the skepticism about the efficiency of the estate and gift tax is the striking fact of how little revenue it raises for the federal government. Despite the tax's broad reach, theoretically touching upon nearly all transferable wealth, the unified tax raised only $14.7 billion in 1995.<sup>48</sup>  As Figure 1 shows, the estate and gift tax consistently has fallen as a percentage of total federal revenues, while at the same time the total amount of wealth has risen dramatically.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

When a tax raises significantly less than the estimate of its potential, it is often because taxpayers have discovered ways to avoid the tax and have changed their economic behavior in ways that reduce the pool of funds from which the tax is drawn. To understand the extent to which this happens, it is necessary to estimate just what estate tax collections theoretically should look like.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Public finance economists have struggled for a long time with this question. Producing an adequate answer, however, requires knowing a great deal more than we now do about the size of legal tax avoidance and the degree to which taxpayers change their economic behavior in order to reduce their estate tax liabilities. Moreover, economists do not know the size of the wealth pool within which estates are formed. The Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis periodically estimates household net worth, or the sum of durables, savings, and equities held by households.<sup>49</sup>  The Bureau currently estimates this net worth to be about $26.4 trillion, of which $8.4 trillion is in equities. While this amount by no means constitutes the tax base for the estate tax, a portion of this enormous sum most certainly does. For example, Laurence J. Kotlikoff estimates that slightly more than 50 percent of household wealth is held as intergenerational savings.<sup>50</sup>  If one assumes that this 50 percent (or $13.2 trillion) is transferred in equal amounts over two generations, or 46 years, then about $290 billion annually is moving to the next generation.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Even this figure probably overstates the tax base for the estate tax. Many economists argue that taxpayers who believe they will pay estate taxes will change their economic behavior in ways that result in a huge shrinkage of the estate tax base.<sup>51</sup>  B. Douglas Bernheim argues that high estate tax rates lead taxpayers to make far more cash gifts to their children than they otherwise would, in large part because their children pay taxes at lower rates than they do. Bernheim estimates that 50 percent to 75 percent of all intergenerational gifts are made because of the estate tax. Charitable gifts and other revenue losses are between 70 percent and 80 percent of total estate tax revenue. Put another way, indirect revenue losses in 1995 might have been $11 billion on revenues of $14.7 billion.<sup>52</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The revenue data strongly imply significant tax avoidance and other economic behavior that responds to high tax rates by moving national wealth (and thus taxable estates) from savings to consumption. It is exceptionally difficult, however, for analysts to go from implication to quantification. Recent breakthroughs in the economic understanding of household savings may lead ultimately to convincing estimates of how much savings behavior stems from income and estate tax policy. Even so, economists can offer a number of important insights about the deleterious economic effects of tax policy on economic performance.
<p>
<li><b>The estate tax discourages savings.</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Savings take many different forms -- cash reserves in a bank, stock in a corporation, art, land, housing, ownership of a business, and so forth -- that serve many different purposes. Households hold cash in a bank largely to finance future consumption, like the purchase of a house, or as a hedge against unanticipated household expenses like costly medical care. Similarly, the equity component of a mortgage is designed to be used to purchase future housing. These two forms of savings are largely liquid and thus earn relatively low rates of return. Households put money in a bank with the understanding that their funds can be withdrawn virtually at any time the household prefers. The bank, in turn, lends these savings with this same understanding in mind, and therefore prefers relatively short-term, low-risk loans that contain significant liquidity for the bank. So if a household saves in a long-term time deposit (for example, a 10-year certificate of deposit), it will demand a higher rate of return as compensation for not having these funds available for consumption. The bank, in turn, is freer to invest in riskier ventures for which it also can demand a higher rate of return. The bank's cost of a loan failure also falls when it is working with longer-term savings: It knows it has a certain period of time to make successful loans that cover its contract with the saver and yield the bank a profit.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The decision to save largely follows this simple story. When households consume most of their income, any long-term investment must earn a high return. However, when they increase their savings relative to their consumption of income, they require less compensation for foregone consumption, and the required rate of return falls. Economists are divided between those who believe that households have a relatively fixed savings percentage over their lifetimes (which implies relatively fixed time preferences) and those who see the percentage of savings as something that fluctuates as certain preferences (including time or consumption) and costs (particularly taxes) change. It is this latter viewpoint that is particularly relevant to estate tax analysis.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Taxes play a role in savings decisions because they increase the cost of saving relative to consuming income. For example, if a household invests 25 percent of its income after taxes in a bank account that earns interest, it will pay additional taxes on any interest it takes as income. If another household decides to invest its 25 percent in corporate stocks, it will pay additional taxes on any capital gains it takes as income. However, if both households take that same 25 percent of after-tax income and buy expensive shoes, no additional income taxes will be collected. No doubt sales taxes will be collected on the shoe purchases, but sales tax rates are almost always less than the income tax rate one would pay on the same amount of money. Thus, taxes discourage saving by increasing its cost relative to consumption. If the household saves anyway, it will demand a higher rate of return to compensate it for the taxes it must pay on interest earnings. Likewise, a household purchasing stocks will demand a higher and more secure rate of return on its stocks. In both cases, the cost of capital to the borrower -- to the bank or to the corporation -- has risen because of taxes.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One way for a household to save and avoid additional taxation is to purchase an asset like art or land that appreciates slowly over a very long period of time. This kind of purchase, however, also increases the economy-wide cost of capital by reducing the fund of money available to banks and businesses. Still another way to reduce the tax cost of saving is to invest in tax-advantaged funds, such as IRAs or 403(b) and 401(k) plans. These types of funds annuitize savings, which means essentially that only low-risk, long-term, low-yield to medium-yield investments will be supported by them. While they do reduce current tax liabilities, they are especially costly for the saver in two ways: In addition to shrouding these plans in penalties and taxes should they be liquidated before the saver reaches a certain age, the government has significantly discounted the future value of these savings by delaying taxes on earnings until they are at their highest level.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The unified estate and gift tax adds yet another layer of taxes on any savings decision a household makes. Successful saving always raises the possibility of creating a taxable estate, at which point the tax cost of a dollar saved increases by an amount somewhere between 7.4 cents and 55 cents. So if the household persists in its decision to save, it will require some long-term premium return on its investments roughly equal to its estimate that estate taxes will not be avoided. Naturally, this premium further increases the cost of capital.

<p><li><b>The estate tax hurts small business.</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Investing in a business is one of the many forms of saving -- for some families, the only form. For most small firms, every available dollar goes into the family business -- the dry-cleaning business, the restaurant, the trucking company -- because the business creates an asset for the children and incomes for the owners. Women re-entering the work force after raising children often find self-employment the only entry-level employment open to them. Minorities know the reasons for self-employment only too well.
</ul><p><b>
Minorities Hit Hard.</b> All of the financial security provided by these businesses is put at risk if the owner dies with a taxable estate. In an important 1995 study of how minority businesses perceive the estate tax,<sup>53</sup> Joseph Astrachan and Craig Aronoff found that:
<ul>
<p><li>Some 90 percent of the surveyed minority businesses knew that they might be subject to the federal estate tax;

<p><li>About 67 percent of these businesses had taken steps (including gifts of stock, ownership restructuring, life insurance purchases, and buy/sell agreements) to shelter their assets from taxation;

<p><li>Over 50 percent of these same businesses indicated that they would not have taken these steps had there been no estate tax; and

<p><li>Some 58 percent of all the businesses in the survey anticipated failure or great difficulty surviving after determining their estate taxes.<sup>54</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Astrachan/Aronoff study echoes findings in a 1994 study by Patrick Fleenor and J. D. Foster of the Tax Foundation, a Washington-based tax policy organization,<sup>55</sup> who presented estimates of lifetime effective tax rates for a taxable corporation, a non-corporate business, an individual earning high amounts of labor income, and a large business. In each case, Fleenor and Foster found that the presence of the estate tax raised the lifetime tax rate to a figure above 65 percent. The large business simulation determined a tax rate of 72 percent. Nearly every public finance economist of the last 50 years has concluded that tax rates of this magnitude significantly reduce the taxpayer's willingness to earn more and take entrepreneurial risk. And these two effects -- reductions in labor and in new business formation -- directly depress the rate of general economic growth, which should deeply concern everyone interested in improving economic welfare in the United States.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While Professor McCaffery appears unaware of the Fleenor/Foster study, it includes precisely the kind of evidence he has marshaled to assail the estate tax as inimical to the expansion of economic opportunity. He is not, however, unaware of Richard E. Wagner's important 1993 monograph, <i>Federal Transfer Taxation: A Study in Social Cost,</i> which ties together the many threads of this emerging theoretical canon on estate taxation.<sup>56</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Professor Wagner's study stands virtually alone in presenting macroeconomic estimates of the estate tax's effects on individual decisions to work and save. Using a model that trades labor for capital according to their relative costs and that represents this dynamic interaction through key indicators of macroeconomic activity, Wagner found that the tax premiums created by the estate tax raise the cost of capital sufficiently to reduce national output, employment, and capital stock by measurable amounts. In a simulation that modeled the U.S. economy without the current estate tax, Wagner found that:
<ul>
<p><li>Nominal gross domestic product (GDP) would have been $80 billion higher after eight years than in an economy without the estate tax;

<p><li>228,000 more jobs would have been created;

<p><li>The capital stock would have been $640 billion larger;<sup>57</sup> and

<p><li>The larger economy resulting from the repeal of estate taxes produced increases in all other taxes over the eight-year simulation period, though not quite by an amount equal to the loss of the estate tax.<sup>58</sup>
</ul><p>

<b>THE IMPACT OF REPEALING THE ESTATE TAX</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While analysts have made significant progress in understanding the microeconomic effects of intergenerational taxation, the dearth of studies similar to Wagner's shows that much work still needs to be done on measuring the tax's macroeconomic effects. It is little wonder, however, that such studies are not more numerous. As Stiglitz noted, there are many remaining questions about the tax's effects on wealth accumulation. And without a good knowledge of these effects, economists cannot create that most elementary but crucial of concepts in any tax analysis: the tax base.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Bearing in mind these limitations, the author and Heritage Foundation analysts have estimated the economic impact of repealing the estate and gift tax beginning in 1997. The Heritage analysis made certain assumptions about the effect of repeal. Each of these assumptions was introduced into two leading models of the U.S. economy: the Washington University Macro Model (WUMM) and the Mark 11 macroeconomic model of Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates.<sup>59</sup>  These two statistical models of U.S. economic activity are highly regarded, exceptionally accurate tools for estimating the effects of public policy changes on the general economy and are widely used for this purpose by America's leading corporations and government agencies.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Given the substantial doubt that annual estate tax filings fully reflect the size of the tax base,<sup>60</sup> estimates of the tax's economic effects must start from another foundation. The macroeconomic estimates presented here were built from estimates of changes in the U.S. labor force and domestic capital stocks associated with removing the estate tax portion of the after-tax cost of labor and capital. These estimates then were introduced into the macroeconomic models to compute the effects.

<p>
<b>Cost of Capital Assumptions</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
The cost of capital (the so-called rental price of investment) results from at least three factors: 1) the cost of attracting investors to supply capital funds and not do something else with their money, 2) the ratio of a capital good's depreciation relative to the value of output it produces, and 3) taxes. If a business or a household borrows money, it must pay the lender or investor enough to attract that lender or investor away from other opportunities. A portion of this "opportunity cost" payment is the tax that the lender expects to owe on the loan's earnings. Under current law, a business may offset some of this tax premium by deducting its annual depreciation and interest payments. In some cases, businesses also may claim various investment tax credits that further reduce the tax premiums they have had to pay to lenders. However, a substantial portion of the cost of operating a business is not tax deductible, and this results in a positive, residual tax premium in real-world capital costs.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Of course, taxes on ordinary income constitute a substantial percentage of the tax premium in the cost of capital. Every investor attempts to earn the highest possible return on every investment so that his earnings cover the income taxes the investment incurs. The estate tax, however, also is a part of this premium. Just as households are the source of all investment funds, they also are the source of all estate taxes. When individuals begin to see that their income and investment efforts will produce a future taxable estate, they generally do two things: see a financial advisor or estate planner, and increase their earnings requirements to build the funds needed to pay the wealth transfer taxes.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Using data associating incomes with tax liabilities and holdings of corporate paper and equities, Heritage analysts estimated that the present value of future estate tax liabilities for the class of households that holds most corporate debt is slightly more than 3 percent of the average yield on corporate bonds. Thus, if corporate bonds currently yield 10 percent, eliminating wealth transfer taxes would reduce the required yield to 9.7 percent. This estimate of the estate tax component of the tax premium was used to adjust projected corporate bond yields over the period 1997 through 2005.

<p>
<b>Labor Effect Assumptions</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Economists also argue that high taxes reduce the supply of labor. At a certain point, when faced with rising taxes, workers decide to consume more leisure and produce less labor. Wealth transfer taxes are widely assumed to produce this effect, particularly among a class of individuals who clearly perceive the adverse tax consequences of working harder and building greater taxable net worth.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To capture this effect of estate taxes and introduce it into the U.S. macroeconomic model, Heritage analysts estimated the number of wage or salaried workers and self-employed individuals in this same class of households that hold most of America's corporate debt. Eliminating the estate tax would be equivalent to increasing after-tax lifetime earnings by the average effective estate tax rate, or by 18 percent. This percentage, of course, is the minimum amount of earnings change that estate tax repeal would cause: A significant but unknown amount of time and income now is devoted to positioning assets and paying accountants in order to avoid significant estate tax liabilities. This estimate also fails to capture the substantial costs borne by taxpayers and relatives when businesses fail because of estate tax liabilities. In any event, multiplying a standard labor supply elasticity of 0.3 percent by this percentage reduction in taxes, and then multiplying this product times the 18 million individuals in this class of households, yields a labor supply effect of 97,200. This number was used to adjust upwards all estimates of the civilian labor force for the period 1997 through 2005.
<p>
<b>Budget Assumptions</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Besides introducing new labor force and capital cost settings into the macroeconomic model, Heritage also made two adjustments in the federal government's budget for the period 1997 through 2005. First, the total amount of federal revenues was reduced by the forecasted amount of the estate tax. Second, expenditures for non-defense purchases were reduced by an amount exactly equal to the "lost" estate tax revenue. Thus, repealing the estate tax is assumed to be offset by spending reductions, so there is no net contribution to the deficit because of lost estate tax revenue.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

It is highly likely that eliminating the estate tax would result in slightly greater federal income tax receipts. Without an estate tax, taxpayers would make fewer gift transfers to their children, who commonly pay income taxes at rates lower than their parents. However, estimating the size of this effect on income tax revenues involves overcoming a host of problems raised by incomplete estate tax data. The IRS simply is unwilling to disclose important details on intergenerational giving. Thus, the following analysis does not contain estimates of the positive effects of estate tax repeal on income tax receipts. If we had made these estimates, the macroeconomic effects of repeal would have been even more positive.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

By adapting the macroeconomic models in the manner described above, the resulting estate tax simulation measures the economic effects of repealing this tax on December 31, 1996. That is, it shows how differently the economy would have behaved had taxpayers not faced the prospect of estate taxes beginning in 1997. This simulated economy is compared to a "baseline" economy in which the current estate tax is still present. The differences between the baseline and simulated economies are the dynamic impacts of estate tax repeal. Again, these estimates should be viewed as a minimum assessment of the tax's economic effects.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Table 2 indicates that a stronger economy would result from the repeal of wealth transfer taxes.
<ul><p><li>
The most general measurement of economic health (GDP adjusted for inflation) quickly jumps above baseline by as much as 0.4 percent in the Heritage analysis using the WUMM. The increase in real GDP averages $11.2 billion per year over the nine-year period between 1997 and 2005. Figure 3 shows the effects on GDP caused by estate tax repeal. When the Heritage assumptions are fed into the WEFA model, the economy grows above baseline by an average of $2.83 billion over this period.<sup>61</sup>
<p><li>
Behind the growth in GDP is a strong increase in investment. A drop in the cost of capital caused by estate tax repeal leads to increased business purchases of buildings and machines. Investment in the goods that make labor more productive grows 2 percent faster between 1997 and 2005 than it otherwise would. Using the WEFA model, investment grows 0.9 percent faster over this same time period. Economists widely believe that growth in capital goods is closely related to economic growth, and that this helps explain the higher growth in GDP.
<p><li>
In addition to stimulating the growth of private investment, repealing the estate tax reduces the tax costs that workers face. Lower taxes on income are widely believed to result in a larger labor force. The Heritage estate tax simulation results in a significant growth in non-farm private employment, whichever model is used. Total non-farm employment grows by an average of 145,000 above baseline during the nine-year period using the WUMM. This growth subsides in subsequent years as wages rise to reflect the greater productivity of labor caused by the greater amount of capital per laborer. By 2003, total non-farm employment has returned to its long-term growth trend. The Heritage analysis using the WEFA model estimates average employment growth to be 86,000 over this period.
<p><li>
Not only do businesses take advantage of lower capital costs to buy new plant and equipment, but families increase their purchases of new homes. Housing starts jump sharply during the first two years after repeal. The Heritage simulation using the WUMM model predicts that estate tax repeal would lead to a first-year increase of 49,000 in housing starts. This effect is caused by a significant drop in the mortgage interest rate. The fact that it does not drop more in subsequent years explains why housing starts return to baseline after the third year following repeal.
<p><li>
The boost in housing and the growth in business investment expenditures reflect the lower capital costs that result from removing the estate tax premium on capital. The cost of corporate capital and the secondary mortgage rate fall by an average of 21 and 27 basis points, respectively, in the Heritage analysis using the WUMM. While this decline is less dramatic in the WEFA model, the user cost of capital remains solidly below baseline throughout the nine-year period. As economic activity builds following repeal of the estate tax, demand for capital rises, leading to small increases in both the long bond rate and the federal funds rate. Subtle elevations in these market lending rates would be the expected result in an economy that is adding more jobs and creating more capital goods than an economy still burdened by high tax rates.
<p><li>
The growth in household income also supports the increase in housing starts. Between 1997 and 2005, inflation-adjusted household disposable income (broadly, what is left after taxes) grows by an average of $12 billion per year in the Heritage analysis using the WUMM model. Similar growth also occurs in total personal income, which increases by an average of $8 billion per year. Both of these income indicators rise because of higher levels of employment, greater worker productivity, and stronger household and business consumption. The WEFA model shows inflation-adjusted disposable income rising by an average of $9 billion per year and personal income growing by an average of $5 billion per year over this nine-year period.
<p><li>
Despite the loss of $15 billion in annual revenue and $15 billion less in government spending, the federal deficit does not worsen over this nine-year period. In fact, the WUMM simulation shows that a stronger economy leads to deficit improvement. For each of the first seven years in the estate tax simulation, the deficit is slightly less after estate tax repeal than in an economy with an estate tax. During the last two years of the simulation, higher interest rates cause a gentle rise in federal expenditures. Te WEFA simulation indicates minor deficit changes throughout the nine-year period. Both simulations, however, point to the same conclusion: The economic benefits from estate tax repeal should not be sacrificed because of concerns about a federal deficit.
</ul><p><b>
CONCLUSION</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

It is easy in this season of big tax reform proposals to overlook the federal estate tax. This tax, after all, is a relatively minor source of federal revenue that has been declining for the past 20 years. Indeed, many of those involved in the ongoing tax policy debate simply ignore it.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This is a mistake. As this study has shown, the economic cost of the estate tax is many times greater than the revenue it produces, and its reach into American households extends far beyond those few which pay it. Every day, social and economic decisions are made with the estate tax in mind. Minority businesspeople suffer anxious moments wondering whether the savings they have built in their businesses, and that they plan to hand to their children, will be destroyed by the estate tax bill. Poor people, for whom the estate tax has no immediacy, wonder at the scarcity of entry-level jobs or the absence of low-cost educational loans. Factories drone on with worn-out equipment that would be replaced if capital costs fell. Women who have raised their children struggle to find ways to re-enter the work force without upsetting the family's estate tax avoidance plan. Rich people buy vacations in Vail and fine art in Lisbon, rather than new businesses that create jobs and incomes, because the government has a claim on more than half of everything they cannot spend.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The estate and gift tax does much to perpetuate the social and economic distortions produced generally by taxes on income. Should Congress repeal this tax, however, the result would be a growing economy, more abundant jobs, and offices and factories with the kind of new equipment that elevates productivity and supports higher wages. Lower capital costs also would mean new small businesses, which traditionally have served as economic havens for minority families and launching pads for young workers. By repealing the estate and gift tax, Congress would be making significant progress toward creating a tax policy that complements rather than undermines other efforts to expand economic opportunity by creating a growing economy.

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 introduced a tougher penalty on generation-skipping wealth transfers by taxing all such transfers at the top marginal rate of 55 percent. And the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 further forestalled the fall in the top tax rate until the end of 1992.

    "Fair market value" apparently means the value of an asset that a fully informed buyer would pay in a market for the asset. The concept implies the existence of a willing seller and able buyer, which is rarely the case when an estate is valued for tax purposes. Thus, executors must rely on various proxy prices for an estate's assets, such as recent closing prices for stocks and bonds and property sales of similar assets that are contemporary with the death of the decedent. The value of "good will" is a particularly vexing problem in estate tax valuation. Due to the numerous artifices that executors and courts must employ to place a value on estates, the resulting "gross estate" frequently bears little relationship to its market value. For example, an estate consisting solely of art that has been held for many years may have little market value if the tastes of the art-buying public have changed dramatically during the holding period.
<p><li>
    While "fair market value" at the time of death is the most common method of quantifying a decedent's death, an executor of an estate paying tax can elect an alternative valuation date that is somewhat earlier or six months after the date of death. This alternative date method applies particularly to estates dominated by bonds or stocks in companies whose value is significantly affected by the death of the decedent. See 26 U.S.C. Secs. 2031(a) and 2032(a).

    This Study was prepared by The Heritage Foundation using tax simulation models developed by The Heritage Foundation and the Washington University Macro Model and the Mark 11 U.S. Macro Model of Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates. The methodologies, assumptions, conclusions, and opinions herein are entirely those of The Heritage Foundation. They have not been endorsed by, and do not necessarily reflect the views of, the owners of these two macroeconomic models.
<p><li>
    From an economic standpoint, a tax's base is composed of some quantifiable behavior that is being affected by the tax. The estate tax base could be viewed as the sum of all those dollars that are managed annually so as to avoid paying the tax, plus those that end up on a tax form.
<p><li>
     Even though these two estimates of additional GDP are different, the two models indicate the same general result: The economy grows more without the estate tax. The outputs of econometric models often differ, even when employing the very same assumptions, because of subtle differences in the theoretical viewpoints upon which the models are constructed. After all, such models are intended to give analysts insight into how changes in specific economic relationships affect the macroeconomy. The differences between the two models used in this study stem largely from WUMM's greater emphasis on the rental price of investment as a driver of economic activity.

<a href="bg1081b.html#ahs">What Shortage of Affordable Housing?</a>
<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Secretary Henry Cisneros's bold plan to introduce the benefits of market competition into the troubled public housing industry has been stymied in Congress by an alliance of moderate Republicans and liberal Democrats. Yet, despite the opposition, these ideas -- which first took hold during the Reagan and Bush Administrations (especially during Jack Kemp's tenure at HUD) -- have shown remarkable resiliency. With the support of House reformers and leaders, and with bold intervention from the federal courts, there is a good chance that these needed reforms in America's New Deal housing policies will survive lobbying efforts of a public housing industry determined to preserve its costly taxpayer-supported monopoly over housing for the poor. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ensuring this will be no easy task, however, as both the House and Senate committees with jurisdiction over housing policy already have produced bills that would reverse 25 years of market-based reform and, in the process, serve fewer needy families for the taxpayer dollars spent. The Senate's version (S.1260) has passed the floor. The companion version in the House (H.R. 2406) is scheduled for a vote in early May, but confronts a competing reform bill (H.R. 2198) developed by freshman Representatives Sue Myrick (R-NC) and Sam Brownback (R-KS). Significantly, the freshman bill is co-sponsored by the House leadership. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This clash over housing reform is far more than a dispute over spending levels. It is a dispute over how government should help the poor and a chance for the new congressional leadership to end the public housing industry's stranglehold -- a stranglehold that has hurt tenants as well as taxpayers and turned many of America's public housing projects into costly disasters. The leadership's attention, support, and intervention will be essential, both in defending reform against the public housing industry's lobbying juggernaut and in focusing lawmakers on the issues at stake.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What is at stake today is what has been at stake in every year since the early 1970s, when HUD first attempted to extract itself from the costly housing policies of the New Deal: the choice between <I>tenant-based</I> assistance and <I>project-based</I> assistance. Rent vouchers and certificates, the primary means of tenant-based assistance, provide eligible families with the cash equivalent to rent the apartment of their choice, subject to a cap based on local "fair market rents."  They empower tenants and introduce market discipline into the assisted-rental market, forcing landlords and developers to seek to provide the best value for money.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In contrast, with project-based assistance (including public housing), the eligible family is offered an apartment in a building constructed and operated exclusively to house the poor. With its origins in the Depression, project-based public housing was developed as much for its direct job-creating potential as it was to meet the housing needs of the indigent; it is this dual purpose, among other factors, that explains why project-based assistance, on average, costs up to twice as much as vouchers for each family assisted. These units typically are owned and operated by government or nonprofit organizations, although some for-profit developers have been given significant tax and other financial incentives to provide such buildings. This approach empowers landlords and developers, whose incentive is to lobby Washington and produce housing as expensively as possible, not to provide value to tenants or the taxpayer.
<p>
<b>TIME TO GIVE THE POOR A CHOICE</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The significant cost difference is one of the key reasons for the shift, under both Democrat and Republican Administrations, toward vouchers and away from public housing. But the different approaches also have led to dramatic differences in the quality of life for assisted families, and this has been another compelling reason for HUD's repeated attempts to extract itself from this Depression-era program. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Because public housing serves only the poor, typically in large complexes of a hundred or more units, families assisted by this program are rigidly segregated from the rest of society, always by income class and also by education and workforce participation. In the major urban areas, public housing residents are segregated almost exclusively by race. Indeed, one would be hard-pressed to find another American institution that induces measures of racial segregation as effectively as does public housing.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Apparently the courts agree. In April of this year, in settling a desegregation suit brought against HUD by the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland on behalf of several Baltimore public housing tenants, HUD agreed to desegregate its Baltimore public housing projects, to tear down the decrepit buildings, and to provide the majority of the displaced tenants with vouchers that can be used to rent privately owned apartments within the greater Baltimore metropolitan area (see <a href="bg1081b.html">box</a>).
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In contrast with public housing, vouchers allow the assisted family to choose its place of residence from private landlords in the community, provided that the required rent stays within the established limits. This freedom allows assisted families to escape the worst urban communities. As a 1994 congressional report observed, "Studies have found that recipients of tenant-based rental assistance were less likely than public housing residents to live in concentrated poor urban communities.... "<sup>1</sup> With vouchers, a family with children can choose a safer neighborhood with good schools; an unemployed individual can relocate to a part of the community with better job prospects; and an elderly couple can choose a place close to family, friends, and convenient shopping. Whatever their specific needs, families can "self-tailor" the assistance in ways that provide the greatest benefits for a given cost. Moreover, because vouchers are a fixed amount of assistance, tenants have a strong incentive to "shop around" for the best value, and landlords and developers have the incentive to provide good value to the tenants (which does not happen when tenants must live in designated projects). 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Recognizing these advantages, President Clinton's FY 1996 budget wisely proposed to shift virtually all housing assistance from the project-based form to tenant-based vouchers. Under this plan, HUD would end the multibillion-dollar direct payments to public housing authorities (PHAs) and replace them with indirect support through vouchers that would be provided directly to the tenants now living in these projects. In turn, the tenants could use these vouchers to continue to pay rent to the PHA, rent better quarters elsewhere, or join with other tenants to hire better managers. In any case, PHAs would lose their government-sponsored monopoly status, and instead would have to compete for assisted tenants by offering better service at a competitive price. Confronted with the prospective loss of revenue, PHAs would have no choice but to improve their performance and lower their costs.
<p>
<b>HOW A MISUNDERSTOOD STUDY DROVE A POLICY FLIP-FLOP</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The FY 1996 HUD plan was the most innovative housing proposal in 25 years and relied heavily on both privatization and competitive market forces. But Congress rejected this proposal, and instead drafted new legislation that largely shifted the housing assistance emphasis back to public housing while merely paring back some of the programmatic <I>impedimenta</I> that had accumulated over the 30 years of HUD's existence. In making this decision, both committees said nice things about vouchers but then went on to cite the findings of a June 1995 GAO report<sup>2</sup> that questioned their cost, with the Senate committee stating:
<blockquote><P>
	The Committee believes that a total conversion to a voucher system is a "One-size-fits-all" approach that is not appropriate or will not work in all markets or in all circumstances. For example, a June 1995 study by the General Accounting Office determined that while nationwide the cost of vouchers versus the cost of operating public housing is similar, the averages conceal wide differences in these two options in different market areas.<sup>3</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The House came to a similar conclusion. It acknowledged that on average vouchers were 10 percent cheaper than public housing per household served, but added: "As GAO noted, these wide variations in cost raise a number of important issues.... "<sup>4 </sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The GAO's acknowledgement that sample observations are distributed around their mean (in other words, a bell curve) would hardly have surprised a high school math student, but this commonplace point was sufficiently alarming for both congressional housing committees to reject the HUD reform plan and continue the six-decade reliance on public housing as the primary vehicle for providing assistance to the poor. Yet the findings presented in the GAO report do nothing to support Congress's action; instead, they support the 1995 HUD proposal to "voucher out" the public housing projects.
<P>
<b>WHAT THE GAO REPORT REALLY FOUND</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One of the reasons HUD recommended a wholesale shift from public housing to vouchers was the significant cost difference in favor of vouchers. As acknowledged in the GAO report, HUD determined "that it cost $440 per month on average to house a family with a housing certificate, compared to an average of $481 per month in public housing."<sup>5</sup>  If spread over the 1.3 million families now in public housing, this difference, described as "similar" by the Senate, would lead to an annual savings of $640 million per year. In turn, if the savings were applied to additional vouchers, Congress would be able to assist another 118,000 poor families now eligible for HUD assistance but unable to obtain it because of limits on HUD funding.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The prospect of a GAO-acknowledged savings of $640 million alone should have encouraged Congress to begin the prompt yet orderly shift recommended by HUD Secretary Cisneros. But the GAO report presents plenty of additional information to demonstrate that the potential long-term savings from shifting to vouchers are even greater than the acknowledged 10 percent. Indeed, the true cost difference may be as much as ten times the amount HUD and GAO presented when a full accounting of all public housing costs is compiled.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

For example, the same section of the GAO report that acknowledges the 10 percent difference also says, in a sentence apparently overlooked by both the House and Senate committees, that "because HUD's analysis considered the capital costs of public housing as sunk costs, it made no attempt to add an imputed debt service charge to the cost of public housing."<sup>6</sup>  <I>In other words, if we assume that public housing costs nothing to build, then public housing has only a 10 percent cost disadvantage when compared with vouchers</I>. The GAO comparison is a classic case of apples and oranges because the cost of the voucher, as related to the rent it pays, embodies all costs, including operating, capital, and debt, as well as other expenses from which public housing is exempt, such as federal, state, and local income taxes, local property taxes, and local licenses and fees. No such costs are included in GAO's representation of public housing's expenses.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Fortunately, the Senate Banking Committee and the GAO provide additional information in their respective reports that can be used to establish a fuller accounting of the costs associated with public housing and allow for a more accurate comparison of these costs with the cost of vouchers. When this is done, it is apparent that, on average, the true cost of public housing is as much as twice the cost of a voucher. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The search for a more accurate assessment of public housing's costs begins with an estimate of the federal government's investment in public housing, an investment comprised largely of the cost to construct and the cost to renovate and modernize the units periodically as they deteriorate over time. An estimate of this total is included in the Senate report, which states that "the Committee is committed to safeguarding the federal taxpayers' $90 billion investment in the nation's public housing industry.... "<sup>7</sup> 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Combining this $90 billion estimate with the GAO's observation that there are approximately 1.4 million public housing units in existence<sup>8</sup> yields an average per unit historic investment/cost of $65,000. Of course, today's per unit costs are much higher than the average of costs cumulated over past years. HUD estimates current public housing development costs at an average of $88,073 per unit.<sup>9</sup>  For example, HUD has just announced the planned construction of a new project in Washington, D.C., that will have an eye-popping estimated expenditure per unit of $186,500, and a new project in Baltimore entailing expenditures of $340,000 per unit when the cost of other amenities at the project is included.<sup>10</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In order to pro rate this historic $65,000 cost over the useful life of the project, as well as establish an estimate for the costs associated with the debt service charges that would be incurred for this estimated average investment, a useful proxy is the monthly payment associated with a 30-year fixed rate, level payment, fully amortized mortgage. Using an interest rate of 7.5 percent as a conservative average for the government's long-term borrowing rate over the past several decades, this approach yields an additional monthly cost of $454.49.<sup>11</sup>  When added to the HUD/GAO monthly operating cost estimate of $481, this yields a more accurate total monthly public housing unit cost of $935.49, a figure that is more than twice the cost of vouchers. Using the current cost of building a new public housing unit -- $88,073 -- the monthly debt service charge would rise to $615.82 and the total monthly cost of that new unit would be $1,096.82.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

With a cost difference of this magnitude between the two programs, the rationales for the policies embodied in both the housing bills developed by both the Senate and House committees (S. 1260 and H.R. 2406) fall apart. Specifically:
<p><blockquote>
<b>1. Vouchers are by far the better form of assistance. </b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

With full program costs exposed as not "similar," public housing no longer merits the benefit of the doubt, and vouchers no longer deserve the skepticism that characterizes their treatment by Congress. As a result, the policy emphasis in both these bills must be reversed and the burden of proof placed on public housing, not on vouchers. Specifically, vouchers should be the chief vehicle for housing assistance, except when a particular public housing project is not used as a vehicle for racial segregation and can be demonstrated to be less expensive as a result of an independent audit covering <I>all</I> costs.
<p>
<b>2. There are no regional cost differences of consequence once total costs of public housing are included. </b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If public housing overall is twice as expensive as vouchers, the assertion that there are widespread regional differences in costs is also invalid. When the excluded capital costs presented by the GAO are added, each of the examples which purport to demonstrate the lower cost of public housing actually demonstrates just the opposite; not one of these examples survives the re-estimation.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
<b>3. An independent study commission should be established to settle the cost issue once and for all. </b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To date, all cost comparison studies have been conducted by institutions, or contractors to institutions, with a vested interest in the outcome of the debate. As a result, and regardless of the quality of the studies, the analysis is perceived to reflect inherent biases, or at least to be tainted with the view of its benefactor. As a congressional agency, for example, the GAO cannot be seen as wholly neutral. The reason: It carries out research according to specific requests from Members of Congress and sometimes is constrained by the requesting lawmaker in the approach it can use to explore issues and evaluate costs. Nor can studies conducted by HUD be seen as free of bias in regard to prevailing HUD policy preferences.
</blockquote><P>
<b>THROWING BAD MONEY AFTER GOOD</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While the cost differences cited above should leave no doubt that all future and incremental housing assistance should be delivered through vouchers for reasons of both cost and quality, there remains the question of how to make the best use of the existing public housing stock, estimated by GAO at 1.4 million units. Although the taxpayers have invested an estimated $90 billion, this sunk cost does not justify any further investment in the system, since spending any additional dollars on public housing reduces by more than half the number of families that can be assisted, when compared with those that could be assisted through vouchers
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Still, investing no more money in public housing does not mean that the existing stock of public housing units has no role to play in an orderly transition from New Deal paternalism to more cost-effective tenant empowerment. In its present state, but under proper management,<sup>13</sup> much of the inherited public housing stock can provide adequate and cost-effective shelter for those in need, and the assisted tenants should be allowed to live there if that is their choice. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Providing tenants with the choice, and providing <I>them</I> with the funding rather than the landlord, puts tenants in a position to get the maximum benefit from government assistance. Providers of housing, including the public housing authorities, must compete with others in offering quality services to secure their operating revenue, which previously came directly from HUD with no effective requirement that minimal quality standards be met or cost efficiencies established.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If all public housing operators were funded only by the revenues available from federally assisted rent-paying tenants, financial survival would compel these operators to provide better services. Just as important, tenant-based assistance would force public housing authorities to decide which units to continue in operation and which to close down. Units in extreme disrepair would be rejected by voucher-bearing tenants with the right to choose. Ultimately, they would be shut down, as the federal courts forced HUD to do in Baltimore, and the money that otherwise would be wasted on uneconomic modernization could be used to assist a larger number of beneficiaries directly.
<p>
<b>THE HUMAN COST OF WASTING MONEY </b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

It is important for Members of Congress to keep in mind that federal housing assistance is not an entitlement, and that the level of housing assistance serves only a fraction of the eligible population. As the Congressional Budget Office has pointed out:
<P><blockquote>
	In 1989, the most recent year for which the detailed data used in this study were available, about 4.1 million households received assistance from the federal government in meeting their housing needs. Under the program rules in effect in 1994, almost 14.5 million additional households would have been eligible for aid; that is, their incomes were sufficiently low to qualify them. Not all of the households that were eligible, however, applied for aid, whereas many of those that did apply were placed on waiting lists because sufficient aid was not available.<sup>14</sup> 
</blockquote>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In other words, for every one household served by HUD, more than three eligible ones were not. Thus, within the confines of current budget limits, the money saved through program efficiencies could be reallocated to assist the most needy of the 14.5 million poor yet unserved families now on waiting lists. The per-unit expenditures of $186,500 and $340,000 for new buildings in Washington and Baltimore, noted earlier, represent an egregious waste of money and perpetuate the long waiting lists which characterize HUD programs. 
<blockquote>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Example:</b> If the $115 million that HUD intends to spend to construct just 338 new units in Baltimore was applied to vouchers, HUD could have provided a year's worth of safe and decent privately owned apartments to 21,000 of the 25,000 poor Baltimore families on the housing assistance waiting list.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Given such trade-offs, Congress's continuation of new public housing funding defies reason -- and merely rewards the construction and public housing industry lobbies.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Example:</b> Consider the $2.5 billion that the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies proposes to modernize portions of the existing public housing stock. Had this been allocated directly to certificates or vouchers, this $2.5 billion could have provided needed help to more than 475,000 poor households currently on waiting lists for government housing assistance. 
</blockquote>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While some in Congress may defend this multibillion-dollar modernization expenditure as necessary to provide additional housing units for the poor, the government's own statistics demonstrate that it is a waste of money. According to the government's American Housing Survey (see <a href="bg1081b.html#ahs">box</a>), there are approximately 2.6 million vacant rental units in the United States, and about 39 percent of them, or just over one million, rent for $400 or less per month -- well within the $440 range of the average HUD voucher. About 49 percent, or 1.3 million units, rent for $500 or less, also within HUD's range given that most assisted tenants are expected to supplement the voucher with their own financial resources.<sup>15</sup>  In central cities, the vacancy rate is much higher because of continuing depopulation. 
<P>
<b>MORE AUTONOMY AND LESS ACCOUNTABILITY FOR PHAS</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although public housing authorities are financially dependent upon the federal government for virtually all aspects of their operations, Congress has not had much success in using the leverage this dependency should provide to induce improved performance. Despite numerous financial concessions, its not-for-profit status, exemptions from all taxes, and exhortations to better management, public housing still costs more than vouchers on a per unit basis.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The difficulties that both HUD and Congress have had with public housing are underscored by the 15 percent of the units under the control of authorities formally described year after year as "distressed."  Although the Cisneros voucher plan would have transferred the hapless tenants in these units to private sector housing and put the poorly managed PHAs out of business, Congress chose instead to rely on modified versions of Washington-managed solutions. Yet, what little management and oversight of public housing there is comes from HUD. And it was Secretary Cisneros's understanding that trying to manage from Washington is not the answer that contributed to his voucher plan to replace failed central planning and management with the discipline of the competitive marketplace. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Aspects of both congressional committee bills could make this situation worse by diminishing executive branch oversight of the housing industry and key decisions in the choice of assistance. For example:
<ul><p>
<li>HUD's oversight of the PHAs would be diminished by the House committee bill's creation of an independent Housing Foundation and Accreditation Board, comprised largely of the recipients and beneficiaries of federal spending on housing. This board would establish benchmarks for local housing and management authorities, establish procedures for accrediting authorities, and classify authorities. It is through board accreditation that a PHA would become eligible to receive the proposed block grants under this bill. This proposal creates a legislative precedent by turning over executive branch spending authority to an independent board comprised of individuals whose chief qualification for eligibility is the possession of a conflict of interest.
<p>
<li>Both bills move the responsibility for determining the future course of federal housing policy from Congress and the executive branch to the PHAs by granting to PHAs the responsibility for conducting cost comparison studies on vouchers and project-based assistance. The bills then give PHAs the discretion to act on the outcome of their own studies. With so much turning on a single cost comparison, it is hard to understand how Congress can place responsibility for cost comparison studies on the bodies that stand to benefit or lose financially from the outcome of such studies. As recommended earlier, these comparisons should be conducted by a blue ribbon commission of independent experts. 
  </ul><p>
<b>DISTORTING THE PROGRAM TO MAKE IT WORK</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While the taxpayer bears an indirect burden for having his money wasted on poorly conceived programs, the brunt of the failure is born by society's most vulnerable households, including millions of children who are condemned to live in these public housing units or, worse, are denied any housing assistance at all because billions of dollars are wasted on costly and inefficient housing programs. As noted above, the Senate's proposed $2.5 billion modernization program will be at the expense of nearly 500,000 eligible households who will receive no assistance this year because of budget shortfalls in other program accounts.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Added to this is a Republican-endorsed change in public housing regulations that will shift the government's limited housing resources away from the poorest segments of the population by allowing local public housing authorities to "serve residents with a greater range of income."<sup>16</sup>  As the Senate Committee report puts it: "The Committee's bill promotes mixed-income conditions by repealing federal regulations that prescribe strict occupancy preferences and deregulating well-run public housing authorities."<sup>17</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If these proposed changes are enacted into law, the government's long-standing commitment to use its limited housing assistance funds to help those in greatest need first will be rejected in favor of policies that enforce notions of economic diversity. With 14 million eligible but unserved households, of which about 8.4 million are categorized by the CBO as "very low income renter households,"<sup>18</sup> this policy change, at least on the surface, would appear to be ethically odd. But upon closer inspection, it can be justified by the sort of "burn the village to save it" logic often compelling in the narrow factual confines in which government discourse is engaged.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although they have not yet been enacted into law, HUD has wasted no time in putting these ideas into practice. In announcing, in early April 1996, a grant of $25 million to build 134 new units (equaling $186,500 per unit) near the U.S. Capitol, HUD also noted that households with incomes as high as $78,430 would be eligible to move into this project.<sup>19</sup>  HUD made no mention of its plans for the 15,983 poor people in the District of Columbia who are on government waiting lists for housing assistance.<sup>20</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As noted earlier, one of the more serious drawbacks of public housing, and indeed of any government bricks and mortar housing program, is that it serves to segregate households by race and income. By warehousing such large concentrations of the poor, often in deteriorated inner-city neighborhoods where much of the nation's urban public housing is located, Congress has created volatile social environments characterized by high crime, drug abuse, child neglect, and other social pathologies that tend not to occur as frequently with the less costly voucher program that allows assisted households to self-integrate into the community at large. But rather than blame a fundamentally flawed program, Congress blames the victims, and proposes to solve the problem by serving fewer of the poor.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The House committee bill would allow public housing authorities, once compelled to take the poorest and most vulnerable on a priority basis, to rent to higher income families, and would require that no more than 25 percent of a project's units be dedicated to the very poor, characterized as those with incomes below 30 percent of the area's median family income. Expressed another way that better quantifies the human cost of the proposed change, Congress will allow public housing authorities to set aside no more than 350,000 units to serve a population that the CBO estimates at 11.9 million eligible households, of which about 8.4 million receive no housing assistance at all, in part because of programmatic financial limits. With public housing authorities allowed to discriminate against the poor, the worsening situation will likely deteriorate even further.<sup>21</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

However bad some of the housing legislation before Congress may be, there remains the growing possibility that federal courts increasingly will render efforts now underway by Congress and HUD as irrelevant and in violation of the law. As court-directed settlements in Baltimore and several other communities demonstrate, tenants and their legal counsel are becoming increasingly less tolerant of the pervasive <I>de facto</I> segregation that characterizes most of HUD's urban public housing projects, and many of the suburban ones as well. Increased use of vouchers is the only acceptable alternative to the plaintiffs, and to the courts which render the final decision. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But as the Baltimore case also demonstrates, decisions by the courts also can be remarkably coercive, and could ultimately be as disruptive and as counterproductive as were the school busing decisions of a past generation. But this need not happen if Congress enacts a new initiative that breaks with past housing policy and the federally financed <I>de facto</I> racial segregation that is an integral part of it. Legislative proposals such as those of Representatives Myrick and Brownback, or HUD's plan of last year, each of which is founded on tenant choice, would be consistent with American principles of civil liberties. In contrast, the legislation produced by the housing committees of both the House and Senate simply entrenches today's disastrous programs and further frustrates reform.

In a footnote to this sentence, GAO defends its decision to ignore this $90 billion cost by noting that "The Federal government has already paid for the construction of public housing.  Accordingly, there are no mortgages on public housing or associated debt payments."  While this is true in a narrow technical sense, the federal government has, over time, paid approximately $90 billion for this public housing and has borrowed from the public to do so, as the government's $1 trillion in outstanding debt reveals.<p>

The per unit cost estimates were derived from information provided in these two articles.  Repeated efforts to confirm with HUD were met with non-response.<P>
<li>    Thirty years was chosen because it is both a conservative estimate and, at present, the government's official estimate of the useful life of structures, as defined by the Internal Revenue Service for purposes of determining allowable depreciation charges.  Given the exceptional wear and tear that the typical public housing unit is subject to, a shorter period of, say, 15 or 20 years would be more reasonable and also would lead to a higher monthly cost estimate.  As for the interest rate, this also allows the analysis to err on the conservative side inasmuch as the average 30-year government bond rate was 9.2 percent for as long as there has been a 30-year bond (since 1977).  Obviously, this too would yield a higher monthly cost.  Alternatively, using the 10-year government bond rate, whose series goes back to 1953, a time span that more closely parallels the construction of today's public housing stock, the average 10-year interest rate is 6.8 percent, and this would yield a monthly debt service cost of  $423.79, making public housing still the most expensive form of housing assistance.<p>
<li>    Obviously, the GAO's confusion over the properties of normally distributed observations is also rendered moot, and there is no need to elaborate further on this matter.<p>

<h2>Good Samaritan Awards</h2> The Acton Institute for the Study
of Religion and Liberty is a nonprofit educational institute that
explores the moral dimensions of a free society. Last year the
institute established its Good Samaritan Awards to honor and encourage
the moral and practical advantages of private charity. From nearly
700 applicants, Acton recently honored 10 leading models of effective
private charity, both secular and religiously based. Each winner
received a $1,000 grant; three finalists will soon be chosen by
a national panel of judges and awarded cash grants of $10,000
each. The 10 model programs for 1995 are:<p>

<B>The Value of Victorian Virtues</B>
<br><I>The
De-Moralization of Society: From Victorian Virtues to Modern Values</I> by
Gertrude Himmelfarb (Knopf)<br>
 Maybe it's not so bad being a Victorian
moralist after all. True, writes Himmelfarb, the Victorians could
be stuffy, self-absorbed moralists. But it is equally true that
they acted &quot;on behalf of the poor, whom they sought not only
to assist materially but also to elevate morally, spiritually,
culturally, intellectually.&quot; The distinction provides a crucial
lesson for contemporary welfare reformers. The Victorians are
moralists in the sense that they believed in virtues-qualities
of character and morality that were desirable for every citizen
in a civilized society. Late-20th-century America no longer believes
in virtues, Himmelfarb writes, but has substituted for them the
notion of values-preferences that are relative and subjective.
One result is a welfare system that delivers services to the poor
but dares not address their deeper moral or spiritual needs. &quot;We
have so completely rejected any kind of moral principle,&quot;
Himmelfarb writes, &quot;that we have deliberately, systematically
divorced poor relief from moral sanctions and incentives.&quot;
The discrepancy between Victorian virtues and modern values has
produced vastly different outcomes. As it entered the 19th century,
England was caught in the teeth of industrialism, capitalism,
secularism-features of modernity responsible for the social upheaval
America is now experiencing. But the Victorian ethos was grounded
in the Christian traditions of Evangelicalism and Methodism, along
with their secular counterpart, Utilitarianism. The result? &quot;At
the end of the 19th century,&quot; she writes, &quot;England was
a more civil, more pacific, more humane society than it had been
at the beginning.&quot; Two social indicators: Between 1845 and
1900, illegitimate births in England fell from 7 percent of all
births in 1845 to less than 4 percent by 1900, while the rate
of serious crime declined by almost 50 percent.<P>
<B>The Economics
of Trust</B><br><I>Trust: The Social Virtues &amp; The Creation of Prosperity</I> by Francis Fukuyama (The Free Press)<br>
 Fukuyama argues
that America's greatness comes from a spirit of individual liberty
balanced by &quot;a rich network of voluntary associations and
community structures to which individuals have subordinated their
narrow interests.&quot; America in the past was as group-oriented
as Japan and Germany, Fukuyama writes, and this trait accounts
for the dominance of these countries in the international marketplace.
Only societies with a high degree of social trust can create the
flexible, large-scale business organizations needed for successful
competition in the global economy. The crucial difference between
America and the two other nations is that social cooperation here
was not enforced through emperors or kaisers. In America, strong
community emerged in the absence of a strong state. America's
economic future is now endangered by the rapid depletion of its
social capital. Fukuyama argues that the dominance of rights-based
liberalism, the rise of violent crime and civil litigation, the
collapse of the family, the decline of neighborhoods, churches,
unions, and charities, and the breakdown of shared values are
destroying Americans' ability to cooperate with each other. It
is no accident, he suggests, that those ethnic groups with the
highest degree of internal trust are economically the most successful.
He cites the importance of Asian-American rotating credit associations
that count on family members and business associates to honor
their debts. The author explores &quot;the paradox of family values&quot;:
While families in America are &quot;too weak to perform their
basic task of socialization,&quot; in some societies families
&quot;are too strong to permit the formation of modern economic
organizations.&quot; In Chinese, Italian, and French societies,
Fukuyama suggests, family members trust each other completely.
But intense distrust of outsiders precludes civic or political
life outside the family, and nearly all economic organizations
are family-based. Most giant corporations are government-run,
because unrelated people don't trust each other enough to work
together.<P>
<B>Building Blocks</B><br>
<I>Building a Community of Citizens:
Civil Society in the 21st Century</I> Don E. Eberly, ed. (University
Press of America)<br>
 The 23 essays that make up <I>Building a Community
of Citizens: Civil Society in the 21st Century</I> explore the
condition of America's civic life and endeavor to identify the
ideas and policies required for social renewal as America moves
into the next century. The work seeks to define the unique American
&quot;creed&quot; that will inform this renewal: &quot;If Americans
are to build a community of citizens,&quot; Don Eberly argues,
&quot;they will have to do so within, not outside of, the American
philosophical tradition.&quot; Many of the contributors see that
tradition in the ideas of the American founding, including justice
and limited government as well as equal opportunity and responsible
freedom. These ideas remain, as Heather Higgins puts it, the &quot;cultural
building blocks&quot; of America's future. Edward Schwartz (among
others) would include Tocqueville's concept of civil society and
mediating institutions. In the political sphere, &quot;governmentalism&quot;
must be replaced by active citizenship and revitalized political
institutions. The political party, according to Colleen Sheehan,
was supposed to be &quot;the most encompassing and decisive expression
of our common republican opinion and civic character.&quot;  In
the cultural sphere, relativism must be replaced by strong families,
personal morality, and religious faith. Unless America &quot;respects
and protects&quot; the relationship between religion and public
life, writes Os Guinness, &quot;both American religious liberty
and public discourse will he handicapped.&quot;

<br><I>Loving
Your Neighbor: A Principled Guide to Personal Charity</I> Marvin
Olasky, ed. (Capital Research Center)<br>
 Culled from <I>Philanthropy,
Culture and Society</I>, the 12 practical essays in this book
illustrate the virtues and pitfalls of personal charity. The book's
premise is that government welfare and the &quot;upstairs&quot;
philanthropy of wealthy foundations fail because they aim to meet
only the physical needs of the poor. Through factual reporting,
the writers show small-scale, &quot;downstairs&quot; charities
that do more good by urging the needy to change their conduct
and attitudes. As the title implies, the book also emphasizes
the centrality of religion in transforming lives. But even small,
religious charities can forget some of the &quot;basics of successful
philanthropy: think small, and think of souls rather than bodies.&quot;
Some charities err in relying on one charismatic leader; others
imperil their religious character by accepting government or foundation
funding with strings attached. The writers draw key lessons from
successful programs as well as from those that have gone awry.
Gerry Wisz investigates one New York soup kitchen's evolution
from merely offering meals to the homeless to encouraging personal
responsibility. Frederica Mathewes-Green shows how volunteer-run
pregnancy care centers in Maryland enable low-income women to
bring their babies to term by offering them shelter, clothing,
and comfort. Marvin Olasky examines a Texas charity that sacrificed
its success by purging its spiritual qualities to secure government
funding. Dan McMurry recounts how competition for grants among
charities in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, led them to create a pauper
class to justify their existence. Olasky concludes that &quot;poverty-fighters
should commit themselves to helping only those . . . who are willing
to work hard and change their life-styles.&quot; <I>Capital Research Center -- tel: 202-393-2600, fax: 202-393-2626.</I>

<B>A Second Look at Habitat</B><br>&quot;It's
Time to Take Habitat for Humanity Seriously&quot; by Howard Husock<br>
<I>City Journal</I>, Summer 1995. Conservatives treat Habitat for
Humanity lightly, writes Husock, because of its affiliation with
former president Jimmy Carter. But Habitat is fast becoming the
biggest homebuilder in America and offers a program that draws
on conservative ideals. The organization builds modest new houses
in the belief that low-income families will maintain orderly neighborhoods
if they own their own homes. To qualify, a low-income applicant
must meet rigorous standards of responsibility. A prospective
owner must participate in the construction of his home. Habitat
then offers the owner an interest-free mortgage. The owner must
also help build someone else's home, and his house is repossessed
if he defaults on the payments. The result, in many cases: Safe,
clean neighborhoods and low-income homeowners with pride and a
stake in an orderly and prosperous community. All of the money
used in Habitat's construction projects comes from private sources. <I>Manhattan

<B>Foundation Fossils</B><br>&quot; Philanthropical Correctness&quot; by
David Samuels <I>The New Republic</I>, Sept. 18 &amp; 25, 1995<br>
Although their assets have tripled in the last 25 years, Samuels
contends that America's philanthropic foundations have become
irrelevant to public policy. The foundations that once funded
the discovery of the polio vaccine and the expansion of our public
library system cannot boast such lofty achievements today. Samuels
cites four reasons. First, rather than fund programs that offer
practical solutions to failures in education, welfare, and crimefighting,
these foundations fund multicultural programs designed to promote
&quot;diversity&quot; and &quot;tolerance.&quot; Second, these
foundations give more money to liberal advocacy groups like the
Children's Defense Fund than they give to university research.
Third, foundations no longer subject grantees to independent scholarly
review but rely on foundation bureaucrats with little policy expertise.
Finally, these foundations suffer from inbreeding and parochialism.
Nearly 40 percent of foundation CEOs are hired from within the
nonprofit sector, 30 percent from within their own foundations.
The result: chronic myopia. Obsessed with multicultural concerns
and hamstrung by stale thinking, our leading foundations pay little
attention to our society's most pressing issues.<I>The New Republic -- tel:

<B>Wilsonian Liberals</B><br>&quot;Liberalism's
Lost Tradition&quot; by Fred Siegel &amp; Will Marshall <I>The New Democrat</I>, Sept./Oct. 1995 <br>
Writing in the Democratic Leadership
Council's house magazine, Fred Siegel and Will Marshall assure
Democrats fearful of obsolescence that one tradition within liberalism
might accord with America's repudiation of New Deal statism. Woodrow
Wilson's &quot;New Freedom&quot; liberalism took aim at the concentration
of power in turn-of-the-century corporate America by curbing trusts.
Siegel and Marshall suggest that today's Democrats should direct
this ideological animus toward our centralized federal government.
During the 1912 presidential contest between Wilson and Theodore
Roosevelt, they note, Roosevelt was supported by both corporate
moguls and social workers. These odd bedfellows were united in
a &quot;common condescension&quot; for the common man. Wilson
criticized paternalism, argued against social planning by either
corporate monopolies or by a large, interventionist federal government,
and championed individual and economic liberty. Siegel and Marshall
urge today's Democrats to tap into this lost &quot;anti-statist
but radically democratic&quot; tradition by breaking the federal
government's monopoly over public decisionmaking and resources. <I>Democratic Leadership Council -- tel: 202-546-0007, fax: 202-544-5002.  <P>

<B>Drafted
Volunteers</B><br>&quot;Charity Begins at School&quot; by Chester E.
Finn Jr. &amp; Gregg  Vanourek <I>Commentary</I>, Oct. 1995 <br>
Government
by the people or people by the government? Hudson Institute Scholars
Finn and Vanourek assess mandatory community service in our schools.
Finn and Vanourek oppose &quot;compulsory-service learning&quot;
because it confuses political action with community service and
hence promotes projects with an ideological cast. In Cecil County,
Maryland, students earned credit for lobbying the county government
to maintain its recycling program. Furthermore, mandated volunteer
service is itself an oxymoron that obscures the virtue of true
voluntarism. And who's to say which student projects meet service
requirements? In Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, a high-school student
was denied her diploma because the time she spent volunteering
in a nursing home and for Meals on Wheels was not school-directed
service. Finally, the authors claim that mandatory service threatens
church-based and private-sector volunteer work. In the near-term,
mandatory service monopolizes the time children might otherwise
devote to private-sector charity, and it discourages private-sector
voluntarism in the long-run by teaching children that voluntarism
is no more fulfilling than writing lab reports and meeting paper
deadlines. <I>Commentary -- tel: 212-751-4400, fax: 212-751-1174.</I>

<B>Vo-Tech
Strikes Out</B><br>
&quot;The President's Apprentices&quot; by Jonathan
Marshall  <I>Reason</I>, March 1995 <br>
Faced with declining wages
for high-school graduates, the Clinton administration has embraced
school-to-work programs. But Marshall argues that students put
through the paces of vocational training are no better off in
the long-term than students who go the strictly academic route.
A recent National Assessment of Vocational Education study reports
that graduates of vocational education in California are employed
at the same rates and earn about as much as general track graduates.
In fact, according to a Labor Department report released last
year, many male graduates of vocational education actually earn
less than those who have graduated from traditional high school
programs. The central difficulty seems to be that graduates of
vocational education often do not obtain jobs that match their
training. In Germany, where most trained bakers work for Ford
Motor Company, only half of German apprenticeship graduates work
in the fields in which they were trained. Consequently, some studies
show that students might do better to delay career choices until
they gain more work experience and until they can better direct
their career training. The bottom line: Inefficient, vocational
education provides no quick fix to the falling wages of low-income
Americans. <I>Reason Foundation -- tel: 310-391-2245, fax: 310-391-4395.</I>

&quot;Why Koreans Succeed&quot; by Heather Mac Donald <I>City Journal</I>, Spring 1995 <br>
Mac Donald assures us that
the American dream is alive and epitomized by Korean-American
grocers in New York. Their success, she argues, is fueled by the
same factors that have enabled other immigrant groups to succeed:
hard work, an emphasis on education, and strong community ties.
Some of these factors manifest themselves in distinctly Korean
ways. Korean communities form gaes, or communal savings pools,
to provide interest-free loans to budding businessmen. And many
Korean children boost their academic achievement by attending
a hagwon or &quot;prep school&quot; after school and on weekends.
But Mac Donald warns that America has grown economically and culturally
hostile towards Korean entrepreneurship. New York City requires
grocers to pay 14 different taxes and obtain numerous licenses;
Koreans also endure race-based boycotts and racial crimes. Consequently,
Korean immigration has slowed to a trickle and some are returning
home. Urban America will suffer if Korean entrepreneurship is
stifled. By introducing stable and successful businesses to low-income
neighborhoods in New York and Los Angeles, Koreans have spearheaded
urban renewal. Many Koreans are still committed to building successful
businesses here. Will we let them? <I>Manhattan Institute -- tel:

<p><B>Hired Off the Streets</B><br>&quot;From
Underclass to Working Class&quot; by James L. Payne  <I>The American
Enterprise</I>, Sept./Oct. 1995 <br>
The Dallas branch of the Industrial
Labor Service Corp. (ILS) proves that the invisible hand can be
a helping hand. ILS, Payne reports, is the largest employer of
temporary laborers in Dallas. It hires from among Dallas's down-and-out.
ILS pays these workers $4.70 an hour but charges companies $7.50
an hour for their services. ILS uses the difference to provide
its workers with lodging, breakfast and lunch, transportation,
and tools, and it makes a profit of 17 cents an hour per worker.
Unlike most private charities touted by conservatives, ILS is
primarily profit-driven. It does not demand its &quot;clients&quot;
change personal habits and attitudes as many faith-based charities
do. But, Payne reports, laborers find ILS benevolent (it provides
lunch out of generosity, not a desire to raise productivity).
And they also learn the lesson of exchange-you have to give something
to receive something-that many charities try to instill by demanding
behavioral or spiritual change in exchange for material aid. Payne
warns that &quot;working halls&quot; like ILS are threatened by
the news media and the government, which accuse them of exploitation. <I>American

<B>Black Christian Schools</B><br>
&quot;The
New Exodus&quot; by Joe Maxwell <I>World</I>, April 15, 1995<br>
In 1954,
Brown v. Board of Education paved the way for the integration
of public schools. Many black families abandoned Christian schools
in favor of integrated public education. Forty years later, Maxwell
reports, blacks are returning. Nearly 10 percent of African-American
children from kindergarten to fifth grade attend private schools,
up from 3.8 percent in 1968. Maxwell argues that black parents
appreciate the discipline and the unambiguous moral education
their children receive at these schools. They are happy that their
children are required to wear uniforms, that the school environment
they send their children to is drug-, gang-, and violence-free,
and that prayer is an essential component of their children's
school day. The revival of black Christian academies is hardly
the result of separatist sentiment. Their main agenda is providing
excellent Christian education. The rise of such schools is an
indictment of poor public education. In the words of one supporter,
&quot;How many more generations of black children's education
are we going to allow to be destroyed . . . by an incompetent,
costly, self-serving government education establishment?&quot; <I>World -- tel:

<B>Mormon Charity</B><br>
&quot; Work, Not Welfare
in the Mormon Church&quot; by Ralph Hardy <I>The American Enterprise</I>,
Sept./Oct. 1995 
<br>Sixty years ago, at the dawn of the welfare state
and its &quot;culture of dependence,&quot; the Mormon Church built
its own welfare program on the principle of individual responsibility.
At the center of this system lies the &quot;bishops' storehouse.&quot;
Akin to a discount retailer like Price Club, it warehouses foodstuffs
and other essentials. At times throughout the year, Mormons volunteer
their labor on farms that supply the storehouse. Mormons also
fast on the first Sunday of every month, and the money that would
have been spent on skipped meals is used to purchase items for
the storehouse. When a Mormon bishop determines that a truly needy
individual or family has no other means of support, such as relatives
in another state, he may offer food and supplies from the church's
storehouse. In exchange, recipients are usually required to perform
some service for the church community and to search for employment,
with the church's help. Hardy argues that his church's system
is one antidote to the maladies of our current welfare system.<I>American

&quot;New
Kids on the Block: The National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship&quot; by
Martin Morse Wooster <I>Philosophy, Culture and Society</I>, June
1995 <br>
After being mugged on a Bronx street in 1981, businessman
Steve Mariotti wondered why bright inner-city kids would risk
their futures for the paltry $10 they stole from him. Mariotti
wanted to help at-risk children learn how to calculate risk and
reward for legitimate ends. Because schools often do not give
students the practical skills and work habits that lead to success
in business, Mariotti established the National Foundation for
Teaching Entrepreneurship (NFTE) in 1986. Today, NFTE operates
in nine urban centers, including New York City, Boston, and Philadelphia.
Its budget has grown from $600,000 in 1991 to $5.5 million today,
thanks to charitable contributions from foundations and other
sources. And what does this money buy? Student entrepreneurs are
given business cards, a $10 bank account, $50 for start-up costs,
and the opportunity to read the Wall Street Journal once a week.
With this start, students build their own small businesses and
learn about profit, loss, finance, marketing, negotiation, and
customer service. Greg Blair sells trading cards. Regina Jackson
markets the jewelry she makes. Low-income minority students are
the target of this program. In Washington, D.C., nearly all of
the approximately 250 students who participate in NFTE are low-income
African Americans. Consequently, the textbooks used in NFTE classes,
one of which is co-authored by Mariotti, profile the entrepreneurial
successes of formerly disadvantaged minorities. Wooster's reporting
is choc-full of heart-warming anecdotes garnered from his visits
to NFTE programs in D.C. schools. He concludes that NFTE fills
a valuable niche: It is the one program that actually shows inner-city
youth a path to success different from one littered with violence
and despair. <I>Capital Research Center -- tel: 202-393-2600, fax:

<B>Welfare as We Will Know It</B><BR>&quot;Ending the Welfare State, Pts. I and II&quot; <I>Alternatives in Philanthropy</I>,
April &amp; May 1995 <BR>
In this two-part series, 14 leading conservatives
propose alternatives to the welfare state. David Forte wants to
bolster private charities by offering taxpayers a 110 percent
tax deduction for charitable contributions. William Tucker thinks
that for every hour a person spends doing volunteer work, he or
she should be rewarded with a tax credit equal to his or her regular
earned income per hour. Charles D. Hobbs suggests making working
more profitable than welfare by subsidizing private-sector employment
for welfare recipients. George Liebmann argues that we should
model day care in the U.S. after the British, who rely heavily
on parent-organized and volunteer-run cooperative playgroups.
Michael Tanner urges that adoption be eased by lifting restrictions
on transracial adoption, terminating the custodial rights of biological
parents whose children have been in foster care for a year, and
by ending funding formulas that encourage states to keep as many
children as possible in the foster care system.  Michael Novak
argues that teen moms should be blocked from setting up independent
households, while Elizabeth Fox-Genovese advocates placing them
and their children in maternity homes. The proposals assume that,
absent welfare, the private-sector holds the answers to our social
problems. <I>Capital Research Center -- tel: 202-393-2600, fax: 202-393-2626.</I>

<B>Pope John Paul II on Democracy</B><P>
Democracy cannot be sustained
without a shared commitment to certain moral truths about the
human person and human community. The basic question before a
democratic society is: &quot;How ought we live together?&quot;
In seeking an answer to this question, can society exclude moral
truth and moral reasoning? Can the Biblical wisdom that played
such a formative part in the very founding of your country be
excluded from the debate? Would not doing so mean that America's
founding documents no longer have any defining content, but are
only the formal dressing of changing opinion? Would not doing
so mean that tens of millions of Americans could no longer offer
the contribution of their deepest convictions to the formation
of public policy?   Every generation of Americans needs to know
that freedom consists not in doing what we like, but in having
the right to do what we ought.        -- Baltimore, Md., Oct. 8,

<B>Sen. Bill Bradley on Civil Society</B><br>
What both Democrats
and Republicans fail to see is that the government and the market
are not enough to make a civilization. There must also be a healthy,
robust civic sector-a space in which the bonds of community can
flourish. Government and the market are similar to two legs on
a three-legged stool. Without the third leg of civil society,
the stool is not stable and cannot provide support for a vital
America. . . .  We also have to give the distinctive moral language
of civil society a more permanent place in our public conversation.
The language of the marketplace says, &quot;Get as much as you
can for yourself.&quot; The language of government says, &quot;Legislate
for others what is good for them.&quot; But the language of community,
family and citizenship at its core is about receiving undeserved
gifts. What this nation needs to promote is the spirit of giving
something freely, without measuring it out precisely or demanding
something in return.        -- speech, National Press Club, Feb.

Our nearly one million members have been interested in and involved in the debate over whether the Legal Service Corporation can be reformed or whether it should be eliminated as a delivery vehicle for legal services to disadvantaged Americans since the mid-seventies and feel very strongly that the entrenched interests in control of the corporation make it very unlikely that any meaningful reform is even possible.
<P>
Sometimes a program that has gone off the tracks becomes so entrenched and resistant to reform that it has to be eliminated.  The LSC is such a program.  It will do no good to cut off a few branches . . . you must go to the root problem, bite the bullet . . . and start over.
<P>
The Legal Services Corporation was, as you know, established in 1974 to take over the programs then housed within the Office of Legal Services in the Office of Economic Opportunity or OEO.
<P>
You will hear various versions of just why the LSC was established, but as you consider the question of extending its funding, I would urge you to consider that the Nixon Administration had been urged to establish such a quasi-governmental corporation by the Ash Commission in 1971 as "a first step toward reprivatization of what has traditionally been a function of the private sector."
<P>
The LSC has, in fact, developed into something quite different employing via grants and contract thousands of attorneys who have become dependent upon government largesse both for their income and as a means of allowing them the freedom to pursue an agenda that has very little to do with providing individual legal services to those who cannot otherwise afford to go to a lawyer.
<P>
It must be admitted that most of those who came to dominate the new corporation as well as a sizable number of those who fought first to establish it and later to defend it have no desire at all to "reprivatize" the provision of legal services within our society.  Rather, they sought a permanent home for their activities with a guaranteed source of funding free of even the minimal oversight they had faced at OEO.
<P>
And . . . as history has shown . . . the interests that quickly came to dominate the new corporation have a far, far different view of its role in our society than did most of those who voted to establish it.
<P>
Many in Congress who voted in 1974 to establish the LSC did so in the belief that through the corporation they would be giving individual Americans without the wherewithal to afford private lawyers access to the legal system that they might otherwise be denied.  They envisioned a small army of idealistic men and women utilizing LSC grants to help poor families fight unfair evictions or avoid consumer rip-offs.
<P>
Since 1974, however, the LSC has spent millions of dollars on quasi-legal political activity designed to "organize" and "empower" the poor as a group or class . . . money that might better have been used to serve individual clients.  The mission as those running
LSC has seen it is to transform American society by changing laws and governmental policies affecting what they tend to see as their constituencies.
<P>

Partisan and ideological disputes between Congress and the White House have allowed the LSC more than independence they made it unaccountable to anyone.  And this has allowed the interests that came to dominate it to take total and complete control . . . . A case in which the inhabitants were truly given control of the asylum.
<P>
There are no doubt good men and women working within the LSC framework who do see their mission as the members of Congress who voted to establish the program saw it.  I have no doubt that these men and women are out there serving the legitimate needs of individual clients.
<P>
We can applaud the work of these people while recognizing that the LSC has gone off the tracks in pursuing an additional mission that Congress has an obligation to halt.  The simple fact is that the LSC's major impact has not been in serving these clients, but in funding a network of activists dedicated not to helping clients function better within the framework of our society, but to changing that society.
<P>
The question is not whether the policy goals LSC grantees have sought are good or bad . . . or how much time they spend pursuing it, but whether Congress ought to be funding an effort to undermine the authority of the states and to influence public policy at all levels.
<P>
Private citizens have every right. . . indeed they may often have a moral obligation . . . to organize and work for policy changes that they hope will lead to the kind of society in which they want to live . . . and in which they want to raise their children and grandchildren.
<P>
But that is far, far different from saying that they have a right to tax money to finance such activities.
<P>
The funding of the LSC has amounted to little more that the channeling of tax money to men and women with an ideological, political agenda and allowed them to use that money to pursue that agenda.
<P>
Let's be clear.  Congress has no business funding such activities.
<P>
Senator Hollings said earlier this morning that the proper way to achieve such change is not through the course, but through the Congress . . . and he is dead right.
<P>
There is a legitimate question as to whether Congress should be funding even the provision of individual legal services . . . those services which the Ash Commission so correctly described as traditionally a function of the private sector.
<P>
The question of whether the private sector can accomplish this task will be debated in and out of Congress . . . and should be.
<P>
But that debate . . . however it is resolved . . . should not influence your vote on the continuation of the LSC.  As constituted with its network of grantees, contractors, alumni and friends the LSC cannot be reformed or limited to these arguably legitimate functions.
<P>
Instead, you must abolish it . . . reduce its funding to zero, send those who have perverted its original purpose and misused the tax money you have provided them packing . . . and start over.
<P>
If this Congress truly believes that tax monies should be used to provide legal assistance to those without  the funds needed to gain access to the civil justice system, you should design a system that will accomplish this goal, but don't think for a minute that the Legal Services Corporation can or will help you in the effort.
<P>
It's something you are going to have to do on your own.
<P>
Thank you.

<title>Time For a Bipartisan Reform of Public Housing - Heritage</title>

<center><h3>TIME FOR A BIPARTISAN REFORM OF PUBLIC HOUSING: SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION</h3>

By Ronald D. Utt, Ph.D.<br>

<P>
<B>CISNEROS AGREES TO DESEGREGATE HUD HOUSING PROGRAM</B>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Under the guidance of U.S. District Court Judge Marvin J. Garbis, in April 1996, HUD finally agreed to the terms of a settlement of a January 1995 desegregation suit (<I>Thompson vs. HUD, et al</I>., Civil No. MJG 95-309) brought against it by the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland on behalf of several African-American families living at Lafayette Gardens, a decrepit HUD-supported public housing project operated by the Baltimore Public Housing Authority.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	According to the <I>Baltimore Sun</I>, "The suit alleged that the city, the Housing Authority of Baltimore City, and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development illegally segregated black public housing tenants for six decades, which the defendants deny. It said they would 'rebuild segregation for generations' and perpetuate poverty if allowed to redevelop the high rise sites as public housing."<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	In April 1996, HUD agreed to a $300 million settlement under which, among other promises, it would tear down several of the dilapidated, segregated public housing projects and replace them with 814 new, low-rise public housing units. Money earmarked for 150 of these units could be redirected to vouchers if Congress concurs. HUD also would provide vouchers to allow another 1,342 families to move into better neighborhoods. In addition, 664 of the proposed 814 new public housing units or vouchers could be made available for homeownership, partly under a resuscitated version of former Secretary Kemp's HOPE program. Traditional public housing is nowhere part of the court-supervised desegregation settlement.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although in principle the settlement is a significant endorsement of the Reagan-Kemp empowerment policies of the 1980s, in practice the implementation details are remarkably coercive and would deny the winning tenants the right to exercise their choice in using the voucher.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Specifically, the assisted tenants, who are almost exclusively African-American, can use their vouchers only if they agree to move into a "non-impacted" area. In HUD-speak, non-impacted areas are defined census tracts, mostly in the surrounding suburbs and predominantly white in racial composition. In response to suburban concerns that the federal government will be forcibly relocating poor, inner-city blacks to their communities, HUD has established annual quotas under which the relocation program will be conducted. For example, only 60 black families per year will be permitted to move into neighboring Baltimore County in each of the next six years until the 360-family quota of African-Americans for the county is exhausted in 2002.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Although dramatic in cost and scope, the Baltimore settlement is not the first of its kind, and is not likely to be the last, unless Congress abandons its six-decade obsession with public housing.<sup>2</sup> 
<p>
<a name="ahs"><b>WHAT SHORTAGE OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Although the perception within Congress is that there is a dearth of affordable housing available to the poor, the facts indicate otherwise. The table below, prepared by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, demonstrates clearly that a substantial portion of the U.S. rental stock is available at rents well within the range of the resources available to the typical HUD voucher recipient.
<p><center>

<tr  align="center">
<th>Total Occupied Units</th><th>	33,472	</th></tr></table>			
</center>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	As the table indicates, there are 33,472,000 occupied rental units in the United States. In 1993, the most recent year for which such data are available, the vacancy rate calculated by the Bureau of the Census was 7.4 percent of the rental stock, roughly as it has been for most of this decade. This means approximately 2,674,000 additional units were vacant. Further, the number of affordable vacant units available from the private sector, estimated at 1.3 million units, is nearly equal to the entire stock of public housing units now in existence. With the private sector able to provide these units at rental rates below either the partial cost ($481) or the full cost ($935) of public housing, one is hard-pressed to explain Congress's long-standing bipartisan obsession with this failed approach.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	It should be noted that the vacancy rate is higher, and housing therefore more available, within urban areas, reflecting the long-term depopulation trends within those communities as more and more Americans choose not to make their homes in cities. In 1993 when the overall vacancy rate was 7.4 percent, the rate inside Metropolitan Statistical Areas was 7.6 percent, while that outside MSAs was 6.4 percent. Thus, it should come as no surprise that 89 percent of voucher recipients are able to find suitable, qualified, affordable rental housing from the private sector.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The claimed shortage of affordable housing is one of the more popular rationales used by the public housing industry and its defenders to justify pouring billions of dollars into renovation, modernization, and new construction. Indeed, so great is this obsession that for years Congress has forbidden HUD to tear down any public housing unit, no matter how dilapidated, unless it first agrees to replace it with a new unit. Although both the House and the Senate propose to repeal this absurd and long-standing restriction, apologists for public housing still go to great lengths to misconstrue the actual state of affairs, as the House Banking Subcommittee report demonstrates with its creative interpretation of a GAO finding. On the matter of affordability and availability, the GAO says that:
<blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Generally, the lower the vacancy rate in an area, the more difficult it will be for assisted households to find alternative housing. In the New York City housing market, for example, where about 11 percent of the nation's public housing stock is located, the vacancy rate is less than half the national average, making alternative housing more difficult to find.<sup>3</sup> 
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Seven months later, the House Subcommittee on Housing had this to say on the same matter in a paragraph referencing the GAO's findings:
<blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Also, for vouchers to succeed, housing must be available, and availability is very much market specific. For example, the vacancy rate in markets such as New York City, where about 11 percent of the nation's public housing stock is located, is less than one half the national rate. Providing a voucher in this area would be useless.<sup>4</sup> 
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Despite the difficulties that more than 50 years of rent control and rent stabilization have created for the New York City rental housing market, it is significant that HUD has a 62 percent success rate with vouchers and certificates.<sup>5</sup>

<title>Virtuous Reality: Character Building in the Information Age -- Policy 
Review --Jan/Feb 96 -- Heritage</title>

<h2>Virtuous Reality:</h2><br>
<h3>Character-Building in the Information Age</h3>
by <b>Jeb Bush</b> & <b>Brian Yablonski</b>
<p><b><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</b><br>
January-February 1996, Number 75</i>
<hr width=50%>
</center><p>

	The Founding Fathers of this country understood that the survival of our democracy depends 
on the good character and virtue of the American people. George Washington declared in his 
Farewell Address that "virtue or morality is a necessary spring of popular government."
<p>
	Today our political system is threatened by a cultural decline unprecedented in our nation's 
history. The growth of crime, the collapse of the family, the failure of education, and the loss of 
hope for the future are all symptoms of a broader moral crisis. Americans have relinquished 
responsibility for governing ourselves, expecting government to solve our problems. The 
betterment of society starts from the bottom up, through virtuous individuals and families and 
communities, not from the top down through more government. 
<p>
	Over the past 30 years, government has assumed more and more responsibility for the welfare 
of our children and families. Despite the best of intentions, the governmental response has been 
more laws, more regulations, and more programs to protect children from the parents and adults 
who have let them down. Social legislation in this area now includes welfare, no-fault divorce, 
child protective services, the juvenile justice system, centralized education, and government 
programs for child support, foster care, and adoption.

<p>
	Yet the institutions that have evolved from this social legislation have presided over an 
increasing number of divorces and out-of-wedlock births. They have watched as AFDC benefits 
have become an attractive alternative to marriage. State regulations have made it more difficult 
for adoptions to occur. The foster-care system often does more harm to the child than good. 
Child-support enforcement has been a disaster. Parents have less and less say in the education of 
their children. On top of all this, the average family now pays 40 percent of its income to 
government at all levels. 
<P>
	We have abdicated to government our responsibilities in increments not discernible to the 
naked eye, but so consistently that it has become the greatest threat to our freedom in modern 
times.
<p>
	We often forget that the original purpose of democratic government was to <i>protect the 
rights of individuals and to provide for things which we could not possibly provide for on our 
own</i>. Abraham Lincoln said it best when he wrote that the legitimate object of government is 
"to do for a community of people, whatever they need to have done, but cannot do at all, or 
cannot do so well for themselves. In all that the people can individually do as well for 
themselves, government ought not to interfere." As examples of legitimate government 
functions, Lincoln listed maintenance of roads and bridges, disposal of deceased men's property, 
and support of the helpless young. Lincoln knew that government is no substitute for a virtuous 
citizenry that takes care of families and communities.
<p>
	James Q. Wilson, one of the foremost modern scholars on the subject of cultivating virtues, 
has written that having good character means at least two things: empathy and self-control. 
Empathy is the ability to take into account the rights, needs, and feelings of others. Self-control is 
the practice of deferred gratification or being more concerned with the long-term impact of 
conduct than with the "here and now."
<p>
	Thus, character is of primary importance in that it determines whether individuals will be 
selfish or selfless. When we act, do we only take into account our own personal good or do we 
have in mind the common good and the effects our conduct will have on the welfare of others? 
Many of our cultural pathologies are a simple reflection of character, of placing the self at the 
center of one's life. How we ensure a healthy supply of citizens committed to the common good? 
How do we cultivate virtue and persons of strong character into the next generation?
<p>
	The moral education of our children has traditionally been left in the hands of parents, 
extended family, the neighborhood, the school, the church or synagogue, and to some extent 
other civic associations. But look at the condition of each of these institutions. Our children are a 
reflection of our ailing social institutions, families, and communities. The indicators show that 
those character-forming institutions traditionally charged with a youngster's moral development 
have suffered their own disintegration.
<p>
<b>Virtues, Not Values</b>
<p>
	Some of the difficulty can be traced to an overreliance on government and a willingness to 
step back from our own character-building responsibilities. But this is only part of problem -- 
and, hence, only part of the solution. The trouble goes deeper than a simple surrender to 
government. Unfortunately, these character-building institutions have lost the language of virtue.
<p>
	Our complex and diverse society now functions not under a universal set of moral principles 
but rather under competing personal and group value systems. Values -- embodied in personal 
beliefs, opinions, and preferences -- have replaced virtues as our moral beacons, and there are 
many different value systems present in our culture. Our character-building institutions have 
bought into the idea that we have to recognize any and all value systems. Instead of providing us 
guidance, they now provide us with the tools to justify a wide variety of deviant behaviors. In 
other words, they do not teach our children right from wrong, but rather how to make informed 
choices. As one prison chaplain recently observed, our young children need direction, not 
choices.
<p>
	The distinction is critical. Virtues, grounded in universal moral absolutes, represent standards 
of behavior that are fixed and firm in any civilized society. Who would argue that fortitude, 
prudence, justice, temperance, discipline, responsibility, honesty, honor, and compassion are not 
good things? Listen to William Bennett: "Teaching virtue to our children need not be a 
controversial undertaking. Forming good character in young people does not mean having to 
instruct them on thorny issues like abortion, creationism, homosexuality, or euthanasia. . . . 
People of good character are not all going to come down on the same side of difficult political 
and social issues."
<p>
	Values, on the other hand, refer to a system of individualized beliefs and preferences. 
Everyone has values -- even Nazis and street gangs. Overemphasizing values accentuates our 
differences, so that the values of self-expression and individualism now trump the virtues of 
deferred gratification, responsibility, and commitment to family.
<p>
	While public policy over the last three decades focused more on recognizing the differences 
between groups of people and their competing value systems, it did little in the way of 
reinforcing the common bonds between all peoples -- the moral absolutes that transcend politics, 
race, and gender. Virtues, and the moral imperatives implied by them, were either lost in the 
debate or they were mischaracterized as values -- subjective and relative, personal, and specific 
to a particular person or group.
<p>
	Recently, we conducted a simple, highly unscientific experiment designed to see how often 
we use the word "virtuous" in our popular culture. In Florida's major newspapers, we found only 
a few random uses of the word "virtuous," frequently out of context. For example, since 1989, 
the Orlando Sentinel has used the word "virtuous" to describe somebody or something on 92 
occasions, or slightly more than once a month. The <i>St. Petersburg Times</i> has used the 
word 140 times since 1987, or fewer than once a month. In most cases, "virtuous" was merely a 
term used to describe a character in a movie, theater, or book or, sometimes, a person in an 
obituary -- in other words, nonpeople and dead people. This is certainly not to say that the 
newspapers are not reporting on the good deeds of virtuous people. We just aren't calling them 
virtuous anymore.
<p>
<b>Quiet Acts of Compassion</b>
<p>
	Correcting our social pathologies will take time. It will require a renewal of virtue and 
character and a rejuvenation of those institutions that teach virtue and character. This means we 
must regain confidence in passing moral judgments, using the language of virtue, and teaching 
virtue to our children.
<p>
	We must also learn from everyday heroes. Our own state of Florida is blessed by an 
extraordinary number of men and women of character. It is important that we begin to discuss 
character in the context of those who exhibit it routinely. We must elevate the people who are 
redefining our culture for the good, for they are the profiles in character from whom we must 
learn.
<p>
	In Florida, you will find some of our greatest profiles in character in the places where you 
might least expect to find them. Take Delwyn Collins, a kitchen worker in Tampa General 
Hospital. On most days, you will find Delwyn mopping floors or washing dishes in a corner of 
the hospital's kitchen. But each year, Delwyn Collins devotes a large portion of his earnings 
from his $6-per-hour job to support the Angel Tree program, which provides toys for orphans 
and foster children in the Tampa area.

<p>	For years, Delwyn has pulled dozens of paper angels from the hospital's Angel Tree: 
Each angel bears the name of a orphan or foster child who does not experience a Christmas with 
family members, or the joys -- and toys -- that attend the holiday. They become Delwyn's 
children.
<p>
	Last year, Delwyn pulled 35 of the paper ornaments from the Angel Tree. Delwyn does not 
drive a car, so he brings toys to the hospital by pulling them on a flatbed wagon or loading them 
in his bicycle basket. His quiet acts of compassion caught the attention of many in his 
community. In 1995, Hillsborough County passed over several local politicians who were 
nominated to present its Moral Courage of the Year Award to the soft-spoken kitchen worker.
<p>
	Talk to some of the children who inhabit the Miami home of Dorothy Perry, dubbed "the 
Mother Teresa of public housing." For 20 years, Perry has been a surrogate mother to children 
whose parents were strung out on crack or alcohol, or worked three jobs and had no energy left 
for parenting. Her "Youths Progressing" program offers meals, clothes, and safe haven for more 
than 35 abused or displaced kids, ranging in ages from one to 21.
<P>
	"I think this program saved my life," says James Holley, 20. "My mother was having 
problems with drugs, and the state was talking about taking me from her. I didn't have anywhere 
to go." James is now working toward his General Equivalency Diploma. Eighteen-year-old 
Quintin Varnedoe came to live with Perry when she was seven, after her mother died. "My 
brothers were in gangs, telling me to sell drugs and rob to get money," says Varnedoe, who 
enlisted in the Marine Corps last fall.

<p>	Another of Florida's virtuous citizens can be found sitting at his desk in an eighth-grade 
classroom at Osceola Middle School, in Seminole. While most children his age are busy playing 
sports or electronic video games, 14-year old David Levitt has been busy caring for the needy. 
Two years ago, David figured out that school cafeterias have a lot of leftover lunch food_and he 
devised a way for local public schools to donate their unused food to the hungry. On his 12th 
birthday, he made his case before the Pinellas County School Board and won approval for his 
idea. For months, David fought a Goliath of bureaucratic red tape and government regulations. 
His slingshot prevailed: Today, more than 80 of the 92 schools in Pinellas County donate their 
food to the needy. 
<p>
	 To change the course of our culture, we do not each have to run out and start a social program 
or adopt an orphaned child. Rather, we need to do a little in each of our lives to revitalize what 
Edmund Burke called "the little platoons," the family and those local and civic associations that 
facilitate good character. Building character starts at kitchen tables and in front yards of 
neighbors.

<h2>Welcome to <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i></h2><br>

by <a href="/heritage/staff/meyerson.htm">Adam Meyerson</a><p>

<b><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i></b><br>

<i>January-February 1996, Number 75</i></center>

<p>

	<i>Policy Review</i>, the magazine of <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>, has a contemporary new look, a partial name change, and a historic new mission: to restore the tradition of American citizenship by repairing the institutions of civil society and returning to the core political principles of our Founding Fathers.
<p>	Our new name is <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i>. We'll be publishing six rather than four times a year. We will focus on the institutions of civil society -- families, communities, voluntary associations, churches and other religious organizations, business enterprises, public and private schools, local governments -- that are solving problems more effectively than large, centralized, bureaucratic government.


<p>	We think of our mission as "Applied Tocqueville," in honor of Alexis de Tocqueville, the French aristocrat who in 1832 wrote <i>Democracy in America</i>, still the best book about our country ever published. Tocqueville described an America that was the most democratic, most egalitarian, most religious, most prosperous, most charitable country on earth -- with limited national government and active citizen involvement in local government. It was an America of strong families and entrepreneurial business leadership, an America where voluntary associations of citizens were better than politicians in addressing the problems of their communities. <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i> will study the success stories of institutions and civic leaders today who are carrying on this tradition.
<p>

	We believe that the restoration of civil society is one of the most important challenges and opportunities facing conservatism over the next generation. Sixty years of liberalism have left America's social fabric in tatters. The family, the building block of a compassionate society, is collapsing. Crime is robbing America's poor of hope and killing opportunity in vast sections of our cities. Public education is preparing children neither for citizenship in a free society nor for competition in a 21st-century economy.
<p>	Big Government is not the solution to these catastrophes. But merely dismantling Big Government is not the answer, either. Conservatives must rebuild families, voluntary associations, local governments, and other institutions of civil society that will remedy the ills left untreated by failed liberal programs.
<p> 	The return of political powers and responsibilities from Washington to smaller units of government will not automatically bring this about. Liberal ideas, interest groups, and bureaucratic structures are even more entrenched in statehouses and city halls than in the federal government. Nonprofit charities have been corrupted by a heavy dependence on government money. Many leading charities share the entitlement mentality of the welfare state and, as the United Way and New Era scandals suggest, are often less accountable than government.
<p>	Entirely new institutions will have to be created. Conservative public policies can erase the welfare state's incentives for family collapse, but they cannot put the family back together. Government cannot build and sustain healthy marriages, nor teach children to be hardworking, responsible, and virtuous. The family will be restored not by public policy but by private, character-building institutions that touch the souls of men and women and inspire them to be more responsible husbands, wives, and parents. 
<p>	Lock-them-up policies in criminal justice are likewise necessary but insufficient to address the catastrophe of crime. The root cause of crime is spiritual, a hardening of the heart that makes a man or woman indifferent to the rights of others. The most effective institutions in criminal justice will therefore be those that create moral communities and transform individual attitudes and behaviors.
<p>	The second half of the 19th century and the early 20th century saw the creation of the Red Cross, the Boy Scouts, YMCAs and YWCAs, and countless other voluntary organizations that strengthened character and addressed the failings of their communities. America is about to enter another such age, with conservatives at the lead. <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i> will be at the forefront of this movement, chronicling its success stories and describing its challenges and opportunities.
<p>
<center><b>An Invitation to Liberals</b></center><hr width=50%>

<p>
	We hope many liberals and centrists will join us in this adventure. Liberals who have learned from their mistakes of recent decades have a great deal of practical wisdom to offer conservatives who are trying to replace the welfare state. And conservatives will be most effective in the coming era of institution-building if we can harness the energy, idealism, imagination, and intelligence of liberals in our cause. <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i> hopes to be a bridge between conservatives and liberals who are trying to renew the American experiment in self-government.

<p>
	At the same time, we will make clear the differences between the conservative and liberal conceptions of civil society. Unlike liberals, who are mostly uncomfortable with religion, conservatives follow Tocqueville in seeing religious fervor as one of the most powerful forces for strengthening and sustaining civil society. We expect that many of the great institutions that will emerge over the next generation will be founded by churches, synagogues, mosques, and ecumenical associations of people of faith. <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i> will feature a department, "One Nation Under God," that will describe how religious institutions are repairing America's social fabric. 
<P>	We also see business as an essential ally of the citizenship movement. Liberals see nonprofit associations as morally superior to profitmaking businesses. Conservatives, by contrast, hold that the marketplace offers accountability and incentives for performance that are frequently missing from the nonprofit world. The most creative answers to social problems often come from businesses that can profit by solving them. A new column, "Blessings of Liberty," will show the contributions of economic freedom and marketplace competition to the regeneration of civil society.
<P>	Liberals who claim they want to promote civil society frequently use government regulation and judicial decisions to achieve the opposite. The Declaration of Independence accused King George III of a "long train of abuses and usurpations" that denied Americans their fundamental liberties. <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i> will include a department, "Abuses and Usurpations," that will detail how federal and state executive branches, legislatures, and courts are interfering with civil society by denying its institutions the freedom to make basic decisions.  

<p>
	One of our most important departments, "Home Front," will provide news and information about organizations that are working to rebuild the family. While many liberals are belatedly recognizing the importance of strong families, liberal organizations such as the Children's Defense Fund still concentrate on securing government funds for single mothers and the social workers who serve them. Conservatives hold that children need loving families more than they need government money, and "Home Front" will profile the organizations that are doing the most to promote responsible parenthood.
<p>

	Many other conservative organizations have dedicated themselves to advancing civil society. The Capital Research Center, the Manhattan Institute and its magazine <i>City Journal</i>, the <a href="http://www.acton.org">Acton Institute</a>, the Philanthropy Roundtable, the Hudson Institute, the Reason Foundation, World magazine, the Institute for Contemporary Studies, the New Citizenship Project, <i>American Enterprise</i> magazine, the Civil Society Project, Focus on the Family, the <a href="/pff/">Progress and Freedom Foundation</a>, the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, and the <a href="http://www.cato.org">Cato Institute</a> are just a few of the organizations doing outstanding work in this area. <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i> will report on their work, publish articles by their researchers, announce their upcoming conferences. Our goal is to build the American Citizenship movement into one of the most significant political and cultural movements of the next generation.
<p>
<center><b>Freedom with Responsibility</b></center><hr width=50%>

<p> 
	Why have we chosen the phrase "American citizenship" for this movement? Because these words combine freedom with responsibility. These are the two great themes of modern conservatism, and they build on the best of the American tradition. Freedom without responsibility cannot endure; responsibility without freedom cannot create. The great American experiment in self-government has survived for more than two centuries and created more opportunity for more people than any other political system because for most of our history we have emphasized both the rights and the responsibilities of citizenship.
<p>	As many observers now argue, this great experiment is at risk, and the restoration of American citizenship is now the most essential requirement for the renewal of American culture. Moreover, it is the most important unifying principle of conservatism in the post-Cold-War era. The principle appeals to libertarians with their emphasis on a free society of voluntary, nongovernmental institutions. It appeals to religious conservatives with their emphasis on faith and family and responsibility for the needy. It appeals to  growth-and-opportunity conservatives who emphasize generosity and economic freedom. With its attention to the common obligations of citizenship, it appeals to nationalists who want to restore American patriotism and a strong sense of American cultural identity. And the restoration of American citizenship is an attractive principle for bringing liberals and centrists into the conservative fold.
<p>

	The restoration of American citizenship will also bring our divided country together. Americans come from all races, all nationalities, all religions. We are united in citizenship not by common ancestry but by a common commitment to the political principles of the United States: the Constitution, the rule of law, the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We are united, too, by the common duties of citizenship: These have included the obligation to protect our country from foreign enemies, to take care of our  own families, to participate actively in civic life, to assist our neighbors and communities when they are needy, and, in turn, not to take advantage of our neighbors' generosity when we can take care of ourselves.
<p>

	Please join us in the historic mission of <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i>. To the long-time readers of <i>Policy Review</i>, and especially to you who have been with us since our beginning 18 years ago, we say: Thank you for your support and encouragement, your letters, and your comments on our articles. You are our most important constituency. We believe you will thoroughly enjoy the newly designed magazine, and hope you will stay. Our new mission is based on what you have said you like most about the old <i>Policy Review</i>. We are determined to live up to your standards. 


<p>	To our new readers, we say: Welcome aboard. We need your ideas, we need your enthusiasm, and we need your moral energy. Join us in the American citizenship movement, as we offer the analysis and stories that will help revive the spirit of American citizenship and work to ensure that government of the people, by the people, and for the people shall not perish from this earth.

<h2>Hundred-Gallon Heroes</h2>
<P>
<B>by <a href="/heritage/staff/meyerson.htm">Adam Meyerson</a></B>
</center><P>
 Eight million Americans donate blood each year, with the typical
donor giving a pint every seven months. But Mike Hitt, an electrician
from Katy, Texas, visits the Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center
two times a week to donate plasma and platelets (blood components
that reduce internal bleeding among leukemia and other patients).
Hitt first gave blood in 1969 while serving with the Army Artillery
in Vietnam. Since then, he has donated more than 100 gallons of
blood and blood components-67 times his total blood volume. Nearly
a thousand patients have been aided by his gifts of life.
<P>
 Hitt is one of 62 winners of the 1995 Jefferson Awards, given
by the American Institute for Public Service. These prizes honor
ordinary people who, through their volunteer work, are making
extraordinary contributions to their communities. The annual awards
ceremony, held in the chambers of the U.S. Supreme Court, is a
reminder of the greatness of America-a country where liberty and
generosity go hand in hand, and compassionate citizens are free
to solve community problems in their own imaginative ways.
<P>
 The 1995 Jefferson Award winners range in age from 14-year-old
Gustavo Renteria of San Jose, California, who teaches English
to newly arrived Latino immigrant children so they don't have
to suffer in bilingual-education classes, to 106-year-old Billy
Earley of Florence, Arizona, who has volunteered more than 128,000
hours (equal to 64 years of a 40-hour work week) since she started
with the American Red Cross making bandages for wounded soldiers
in World War I. Mrs. Earley doesn't plan to retire from her volunteer
work for at least 10 more years. 
<P>
  Other 1995 winners include DWe Williams of Oklahoma City, a
foster mother who has adopted five children with special needs,
including one boy born without limbs; Mattie Hill Brown of Wilson,
North Carolina, who feeds 200 hungry people every week in the
soup kitchen she set up in the town's Masonic lodge; Ken and Twilla
Eden, who dress up as clowns in Boise, Idaho, to entertain kids
with cancer; 17-year-old Joshua Mele of Fayetteville, New York,
who designed habitat for and stocked 4,400 trout in a nearby fishery.
Charles Fortney of Tunnelton, West Virginia, who has served as
a scout master (for 46 years), Rotary Club president, school-board
president, and a trustee of his local United Methodist church,
is a walking definition of the term &quot;pillar of the community.&quot;
<P>
 One of the awards this year is shared by two brothers, Leslie
Colston and Bill Colston Jr. Both are paramedics certified in
advanced training with the Riviera Volunteer Fire Department outside
Corpus Christi, Texas. These brothers arrange their schedules
so that at every hour of the day one of them is always on call
and prepared to respond to a medical emergency. The Colstons are
among the 1.5 million Americans who provide fire protection and
ambulance service without pay.
<P>
 The brainchild of Sam Beard, a developer of low-income communities
and a former aide to Robert Kennedy who lives in Wilmington, Delaware,
the Jefferson Awards is one of those rare ventures that draw support
from across the political spectrum. Liberals on the board include
Hollywood lobbyist Jack Valenti and Senate Minority Leader Thomas
Daschle; conservatives include William E. Simon, the former treasury
secretary, and R. Emmett Tyrrell Jr., the editor of the <I>American
Spectator</I>. Liberals like to honor nonprofit helpers of the
needy; conservatives like voluntary, nongovernmental ways to address
community problems.
<P>
 The awards also mix public service with business self-interest,
an old American tradition. Nominations come from local newspapers
and TV stations, which see marketing advantages in celebrating
hometown heroes. WGAL-TV in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, sells corporate
sponsorships for its nominations. The <I>Indianapolis Star</I>
received 150 suggestions from its readers, and more than 200 Hoosiers,
including Governor Evan Bayh and Mayor Stephen Goldsmith, attended
the paper's lunch honoring its nominees.
<P>
 Mike Hyland, the executive director of the Jefferson Awards,
has been a TV reporter and a press secretary on Capitol Hill.
&quot;The media and Congress are cynical institutions obsessed
with finding corruption,&quot; he says. &quot;What a difference
it is to work for an organization that looks for heroes.&quot;

<P>
 &quot;I don't deserve this award,&quot; said Mike Hitt, the blood
donor <I>non pareil</I>, as he surveyed the other winners. Other
Jefferson Awardees said the same as they learned about him. Thomas
Jefferson would disagree. The awards are a fitting tribute to
Jefferson's vision of a democracy sustained by independent citizens
of energy and character. &quot;I agree with you,&quot; wrote Jefferson
to John Adams, &quot;that there is a natural aristocracy among
men. The grounds of this are virtue and talents.&quot;

<h2>Salvatori Prize</h2>

	Beginning in 1996, The Heritage Foundation will give an annual Salvatori Prize for American 
Citizenship.
<P>
	Endowed by a generous gift from the Henry Salvatori Foundation of Los Angeles, the 
Salvatori Prize for American Citizenship will recognize and reward extraordinary efforts by 
American citizens who help their communities solve problems the government has been unable 
or unwilling to solve. In the words of Heritage President <a 
href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner Jr.</a>, "The conservative revolution has two 
parts. Everyone understands that part one is to reduce the size and power of the federal 
government. Part two is to return responsibility to American citizens to solve local problems. We 
need to get government out of the way if this is to happen, but we also need to show people how 
to solve their own problems."
<p>
	The Salvatori Prize, Feulner said, is intended to do just that. "We will highlight the success 
stories, and encourage more successes, while promoting the kind of American citizenship 
envisioned by our Founding Fathers." The winner of the annual Salvatori Prize will receive a 
$25,000 cash award.
<p>
<h2>Reforms to Speed Adoption
</h2>

	This nation's $10-billion-per-year foster-care system keeps thousands of children from being 
united with loving parents," writes FitzGerald Senior Fellow <a 
href="/heritage/staff/fagan.htm">Patrick Fagan</a>, a former family therapist and clinical 
psychologist. "The anti-adoption bias of the current public-sector welfare bureaucracy has 
resulted in an adoption process with too many built-in obstacles. These obstacles feed children 
into the foster-care system and keep them there, ensuring a larger clientele for public agencies, at 
a staggering emotional cost," he says. "The quickest, simplest solution is for states, which have 
primary responsibility for regulating adoption, to place the job of finding suitable parents in the 
hands of private adoption services."
<p>
	Only 1 percent of women choose adoption as a solution to their unwanted pregnancies. "Some 
40 percent of pregnancy counselors don't even raise the issue of adoption with pregnant clients; 
another 40 percent provide incomplete or inaccurate information about adoption," Fagan says. 
Yet when adoption is mentioned, 38 percent choose it over alternatives like abortion.
Race is another barrier in the adoption system, Fagan says. A higher proportion of black than 
white children are available to adopt, and many white parents would like to adopt black children. 
Yet the welfare bureaucracy is dedicated to a policy of "race matching," which delays adoption 
for years. As a result, says Fagan, "black children typically wait two to three years longer than 
white children for adoptive homes." 
<p>
	To fix these and other problems, Fagan suggests a number of reforms. Besides privatizing all 
adoption services, he urges states to:
<p><ul>
<li> Remove obstacles to transracial adoptions.
<p>
<li> Enact a strict, 12-month timeline for working out the long-term parental status of any child 
in foster care.
<p>
<li> Separate the responsibility for protecting children from convicted abusive parents from that 
of preserving parental rights for families that can be helped. "Professionals should not be trapped 
between simultaneous demands to reunite every family and to protect every child," Fagan says. 
"When these duties are separated, both goals are better served." 
<p>
<li> Prohibit the removal of a child from foster parents willing to adopt, except when the child is 
being returned to its legal parents.
</ul>
<P>
	Fagan says Congress should:
<p><ul> 	
<li> Enact a means-tested, fully refundable, inflation-adjusted tax credit of up to $5,000 to help 
pay the substantial one-time costs incurred by adopting parents. 
<p>
<li> Require hospitals and clinics receiving federal aid to provide timely and accurate adoption 
information to all mothers who give birth out of wedlock.
<p>
<li> Prohibit the use of race or ethnicity to deny or delay placement of a child in foster care or 
adoption.
</ul><P>
<h2>"Trillion-Dollar Tax Hike"
</h2>

	The tax burden will rise by more than a trillion dollars over the next five years without 
Medicare reform, write Heritage analysts Robert Moffit, John Liu, and David Winston.
<p>
	"The Congressional Budget Office already projects that during the next five years, Medicare 
Part B, which covers doctors' fees and other services, will need an estimated $370.5 billion in 
general taxes," they write in a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/fyi62.html">recent report</a>. 
<p>
	On top of that, if Congress resorts to an increase in the payroll tax to save Medicare Part A, 
the hospitalization program trust fund, this will require an estimated 3.5 percent hike on top of 
the current level of 2.9 percent, or $711 billion in new revenue over the next five years. "Right 
now, when you look at the combined level of taxation needed to save Medicare, the amount is 
almost triple President Clinton's 1993 tax hike, which ranks as the largest in U.S. history."
<p>
<h2>Heritage on the Web
</h2>

After just six months on the Internet, The Heritage Foundation's site on the World Wide Web, <a 
href="/heritage">http://www.heritage.org</a>, has registered more than 200,000 hits. The 
Heritage site is updated daily and features an extensive <a 
href="/heritage/library/welcome.html">library</a> of policy papers, <a 
href="/heritage/dept_writeups/95lect.html">lectures</a>, press releases, and current and back 
issues of <a href="/heritage/p_review">Policy Review</a>. Heritage's public policy research 
will soon be available on the Microsoft Network's Policy Street.
<p>
	The Heritage Foundation is one of 14 organizations on Town Hall, <a 
href="/townhall">http://www.townhall.com</a>, a conservative Internet community. Both The 
Heritage Foundation and Town Hall were rated among the top 5 percent of all sites on the 
Internet. To get free Internet access software from Town Hall, call 1-800-441-4142.

<h2>Clara's Heart</h2>
<b>by Laura Morrow</b></center>
<p>
	Clara Barton struggled with bureaucratic insensitivity all her life. Her biggest problem was 
getting official permission to do good.
<p>
	Born Christmas Day, 1821, Barton showed a talent for organizing charity when she 
established the first free public school in Bordentown, New Jersey. After enrollments soared, the 
local school board pushed her aside.
<p>
	When the Civil War erupted, she felt driven to help. After learning that soldiers from her 
home state of Massachusetts were quartered in the U.S. Senate chambers without beds or 
supplies, she brought items from her home and, with her own money, purchased and prepared 
food for them.
<p>
	Barton discovered that ambulances, medical supplies, and hospital construction were not high 
priorities for the Union military bureaucracy. Henry Halleck, the Army's general-in-chief, 
dismissed them as "effeminating comforts." (He felt the same about shoes and shirts.) Union 
soldiers commonly died on the battlefield waiting for treatment, yet the Medical Department, 
valuing bureaucratic ritual over need, refused to change policy. Frustrated, Barton collected 
supplies and personally arranged their distribution.
<p>
	Barton eventually accumulated three warehousefuls of supplies and persuaded the Army to 
help distribute them at the front. At great personal risk -- a bullet ripped through her sleeve at 
Antietam and killed the injured soldier she was aiding -- Barton fed troops and helped evacuate 
the wounded. Nearly two years into the war, the Army finally agreed to contribute supplies to her 
volunteer efforts. She devised a plan for each state to establish a distribution agency where it had 
a substantial regimental presence.
<p>
	Barton encountered bureaucratic resistance everywhere. When the War Department ignored a 
sergeant's requests for a furlough -- despite the fact that both of his arms had been blown off in 
battle -- an outraged Barton escorted him to the office of Massachusetts senator Henry Wilson. 
She then explained that his furlough request was being disregarded and handed the senator the 
necessary paperwork. When Wilson extended his welcome, Barton commented, "You will 
pardon the sergeant for not offering you a hand -- he has none." The soldier left on furlough the 
following day. 
<p>
Exhausted by such struggles, Barton sought rest in Europe. In 1870, the Grand Duchess of Baden 
enlisted her help with the International Red Cross's relief effort for civilian refugees and 
wounded soldiers in the Franco-Prussian War. Admiring the systematic organization and 
efficiency of the institution, Barton undertook a one-woman effort to found an American chapter 
of the Red Cross. She sought congressional approval for the organization's involvement in 
wartime humanitarian aid, but was initially thwarted by fears of foreign entanglements.
<p>
	To make the organization more attractive to an isolationist Congress, Barton expanded its 
proposed focus to include domestic peacetime disaster relief, an expansion later adopted by the 
International Red Cross under the "American Amendment." Finally, in 1881, Barton founded the 
American Association of the Red Cross in Washington, D.C. She was elected its first president.
<p>
	Barton kept the American Red Cross decentralized, giving hands-on authority to local 
chapters. Journalist Joel Chandler Harris (of Uncle Remus fame) praised the charity's efficiency: 
"There are no exhibitions of self-importance. . . . The perfection of its machinery is shown by the 
apparent absence of machinery." 
<p>
	Nevertheless, in 1904, at 81, Barton was maneuvered out of the presidency by socialite Mabel 
Thorp Boardman, who wanted to transform the Red Cross into a more centralized administrative 
structure based on new theories of "scientific management." After leading a failed coup against 
Barton, she vengefully instigated a congressional investigation into the organization. Once the 
investigation vindicated her, Barton resigned.
<p>
	For her life's work, Barton received the German Iron Cross, the Red Cross of Geneva, and the 
Empress Augusta medal, among other honors. "They do brighten up an old dress," she joked. 
She spent her last years caring for relatives, occasionally pinning her medals on her dress before 
going out to milk the cows. She died at 91, in Glen Echo, Maryland.
<p>
	Today, Barton's organization remains volunteer-oriented and decentralized; its ratio of 
volunteers to paid workers is about 50:1. In addition to collecting 6 million units of blood (nearly 
half the nation's entire clinical blood supply) each year, the Red Cross provides aid after natural 
disasters, processes emergency communications between military personnel and their families, 
and offers first aid and medical training.
<p>
	Barton learned early on that charities attract two kinds of people: those concerned with doing 
good and those concerned with looking good. The former want to help; the latter are primarily 
interested in social engineering and self-aggrandizement. Her persistence and character 
ultimately triumphed over bureaucratic interference, making the Red Cross an effective force for 
good -- and one worthy of the memory of Clara Barton.

<h3>Tougher Law Enforcement Is Driving Down Urban Crime</h3>

<hr size=3 width=50%>

<b>John J. DiIulio Jr.</b><br>

<b>Policy Review</b><br>

<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</i></center>

<p>

	Serious crime is declining in many big cities across America. That's the good news. Meanwhile, the country's largest and most violent cohort of young males will soon reach its crime-prone years. That's the bad news. But demography is not fate. Smarter law enforcement and tougher sentencing policies explain much of the recent drop in crime, and can minimize the damage from the next crime wave.
<p>	Between 1993 and 1994, the violent crime rate declined by 10 percent or more in eight of the 10 cities with the highest violent-crime rates (Miami, New York City, Los Angeles, Tallahassee, Baton Rouge, Little Rock, Jacksonville, and Pueblo, Colorado). In many cities, a sizable reduction in homicides accounts for much of the fall in these rates. For example, the number of murders in Atlanta, Chicago, and New Orleans together plummeted by 17 percent during the first half of 1995 compared with the same period a year ago.
<p>	New York City and Houston have enjoyed truly phenomenal drops in serious crimes, including murder. In 1992 and again in 1993, more than 1,900 homicides were committed in the Big Apple. But in 1994 New York City's  murder count fell to 1,581. Through July 1995, it suffered fewer than 700 murders, and it continued to show declines of 10 percent or more in robberies, burglaries, and most other serious crimes. Likewise, the number of people murdered in Houston declined by 32 percent during the first half of 1995 compared with same period a year ago. Rapes in Houston decreased by 21 percent, robberies by 15 percent, and the overall violent crime rate by 7 percent.
<p>	While New York City and Houston are leading the pack, other cities are catching up. During the first half of 1995, for example, the overall crime rate was down by more than 16 percent in San Francisco, 10 percent in San Antonio, and 6 percent in both Los Angeles and Philadelphia. And the number of murders declined by more than 6 percent in Philadelphia and Los Angeles, 9 percent in Detroit, and 10 percent in Boston and St. Louis.
<p>	What is going on here? Some criminologists dismiss the recent improvement in the crime rate as a mere statistical fluke. But it is hard to imagine that these downward trends, occurring in consecutive years in given jurisdictions, could have happened by chance. Others insist that the slide in crime rates is greased by a dwindling population of teenage boys. There is something to this claim, but it ignores the inconvenient fact that Houston and some other places with growing populations of at-risk youth have nonetheless experienced sharp reductions in crime.
<p>	Finally, a few criminologists have rushed to relate the dive in crime rates to everything from a sudden surge in the efficacy of gun control laws (which is patently absurd) to changes in the patterns of drug use (for example, the decline in crack-cocaine use which, they insist, has had nothing to do with anti-drug law enforcement). One much-quoted criminologist has even declared, "What goes up must come down."
<p>
<b>Bratton's Law: Enforcement Counts</b>
<p>	In many cities, the decline in crime rates can be explained at least in part by law-enforcement efforts that capitalize on community crime-fighting initiatives and take bad guys off the streets. I call this explanation Bratton's Law in honor of New York City's police commissioner, William Bratton. Like most veteran professionals in the justice system, Bratton understands perfectly well that crime rates are not determined solely by what cops, courts, and corrections agencies do. But his impatience with criminological cant about the inefficacy of policing practices and sentencing policies on crime rates is both ennobling and enlightening. Three brief examples illustrate Bratton's Law in action.
<P><ul>

<li><b>Jacksonville.</b> In July 1991, Harry L. Shorenstein became state attorney for the Fourth Judicial Circuit in Jacksonville, Florida. At that time Jacksonville was besieged by violent crime, much of it committed by juvenile offenders. In the year before Shorenstein arrived, juvenile arrests had risen by 27 percent, but most young habitual criminals were released quickly. Jacksonville's finest were doing their best to remove serious young criminals from the streets, but the rest of the system was not following suit.
<p>	Then, in March 1992, Shorenstein instituted an unprecedented program to prosecute and incarcerate dangerous juvenile offenders as adults. In most parts of the country, juvenile criminals for whom the law mandates adult treatment are not actually eligible for state prison sentences and are routinely placed on probation without serving any jail time. But Shorenstein's program was for real. He assigned 10 veteran attorneys to a new juvenile-prosecutions unit. Another attorney, funded by the Jacksonville Sheriffs Office, was assigned to prosecute repeat juvenile auto thieves.
<p>	By the end of 1994, the program had sent hundreds of juvenile offenders to Jacksonville's jails and scores more to serve a year or more in Florida's prisons. Jacksonville's would-be juvenile street predators got the message, and the effect of deterrence soon appeared in the arrest statistics. From 1992 to 1994, total arrests of juveniles dropped from 7,184 to 5,475. From 1993 to 1994, juvenile arrests increased nationwide and by over 20 percent in Florida. But Jacksonville had a 30 percent decrease in all juvenile arrests, including a 41 percent decrease in juveniles arrested for weapons offenses, a 45 percent decrease for auto theft, and a 50 percent decrease for residential burglary. Although Jacksonville still has a serious violent crime problem, the number of people murdered there during the first half of this year declined by 25 percent compared with the same period a year ago.<p>
<li><b>Houston.</b> Almost a thousand officers have been added to the city's police force since 1991. Led by Police Chief Sam Nuchia, Houston has a cost-effective police overtime program that puts more cops on the street when and where they are most needed. Residents of Washington, D.C., which fields the highest number of police officers per capita of any major city, know that more police manpower does not necessarily produce less crime or better police performance. But in Houston, Nuchia has used the additional manpower to jump-start community anti-crime activities.
<p>	To cite just one example, Houston's Citizen Patrol Program has operated in more than a hundred of the city's neighborhoods. Among other things, thousands of citizen patrollers have observed and reported suspicious or criminal behavior, from assaults to narcotics dealing to vandalism. Many once-troubled neighborhoods have gone as long as three consecutive months without needing to call for police service. Indeed, two recent studies found that Nuchia's enforcement efforts not only contributed to Houston's falling crime rates, but also improved police emergency response times, raised police productivity, and reduced citizens' fear of crime.<p>
<li><b>New York City.</b> Like Houston, New York City has greatly expanded its police force. Since 1990, the NYPD has grown by 7,000 officers. Under Bratton, police have been directed to crack down on public drinking, graffiti, vandalism, and other public disorders. The NYPD has beefed up action against street gangs and drug traffickers, returned to a policy of frisking suspects for guns and other weapons, and redoubled precinct-level efforts on a wide range of community-policing projects.<p>
	In the process, Bratton has promoted a new breed of precinct commanders and made them responsible for finding innovative, cost-effective ways of serving citizens and cutting crime in their neighborhoods. Despite recent corruption scandals, the precinct-based management system is working, NYPD morale is high, and New Yorkers are getting results that range from fewer aggressive panhandlers to fewer shootings and murders.
</ul><p>
<b>Criminologically Correct</b>
<p>	Why, then, are many criminologists so unwilling to admit that law enforcement can cut crime? Part of the answer is that more than a dozen major empirical studies over the last two decades have failed to demonstrate either that police manpower and crime rates vary inversely or that particular types of community-oriented policing practices prevent crime. The most famous of these studies is the Kansas City, Missouri, "preventive-patrol" experiment.
<p>	For a year in the early 1970s, Kansas City was divided into three areas, each of which received a different level of auto patrol. The 1974 report on the experiment found that criminal activity, reported crime, rates of victimization (as measured in a follow-up survey), citizen fear, and satisfaction with the police were about the same in all three areas. Active auto patrol -- beats where cars cruised the streets conspicuously two to three times more frequently than in the control areas --  no difference at all.
<p>But academic experts who treat such negative findings as the final words on the subject are badly mistaken. George L. Kelling of Northeastern University, the father of the Kansas City research and many other major studies, recently cautioned his colleagues that "generalizing from a study about a specific tactic to other tactics or uses of police is inappropriate." As Kelling observed, "random preventive patrol by automobile for the purpose of creating a feeling of police omnipresence" is a relic of "mid-century policing tactics."
<p>Kellling has scolded those "academic ideologists" in criminology who "do not let research interfere with their conclusions." He keenly characterizes as defeatist dogma their views that "crime stems from basic structural features of society, and until problems like homelessness, social injustice, economic inequalities, and racism are addressed, police impact on crime will be negligible."
<p>	As a matter of ideology, denying that law enforcement counts in cutting crime may be trendy, but the policy science of the subject remains far from settled. Following an exhaustive review of the empirical literature on policing, David H. Bayley of SUNYAlbany recently concluded that there has never been "a rigorous, clear-cut test of the association between the visible presence of the police and crime rates." Bayley is now in the early stages of a quasi-experimental study designed to test this relationship while controlling for demographic and other variables related to the incidence of crime. Such fine-tuned research on patrol presence, policing strategies, crime rates, and other key variables has become possible only in the past few years with the development of computer-assisted information systems for police dispatching and management.
<p>	Bayley's cutting-edge research will help to identify the general conditions under which tactics and increases in police manpower can curb public disorders and cut crime. For now, there is no solid evidence to dismiss, and every practical reason to uphold, Bratton's Law.
<p>
<b>Wattenberg's Law: Prison Works</b>
<p>	By the same token, there is tremendous empirical support for another proposition that many criminologists reflexively reject: Sentencing policies that keep violent and repeat criminals behind bars contribute mightily to reductions in crime.
<p>	I call this proposition Wattenberg's Law in honor of Ben Wattenberg, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and a nationally syndicated columnist. As Wattenberg has quipped, "A thug in prison can't shoot your sister." Whatever else incarceration buys us in the way of criminal deterrence, rehabilitation, or retribution, it most definitely pays dividends by preventing crimes that prisoners would commit if they were free.
<p>	The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics has reported that fully 94 percent of state prisoners have committed one or more violent crimes or served a previous sentence in jail or on probation. Between 1980 and 1993, violent offenders were the greatest contributors to state prison population growth.
<p>	Even so, today more convicted violent offenders are serving time on probation and parole than in prison. About a third of all violent crime arrestees are on probation, parole, or pretrial release at the time of their arrest. Recent studies by me and others estimate that most prisoners commit between 12 and 21 serious crimes a year when on the loose.
<p>	From 1980 to 1992, the aggregate violent-crime rate in the 10 states where incarceration climbed the most decreased by 8 percent. In the 10 states with the lowest increases in incarceration, violent crime soared, in aggregate, 51 percent. A study published in Science calculated that in 1989 alone, the increased use of imprisonment spared Americans an estimated 66,000 rapes, 323,000 robberies, 380,000 assaults, and 3.3 million burglaries. In a research report targeted against California's three-strikes law (life without parole for thrice-convicted felons), the RAND Corp. conservatively estimated that the measure would spare Californians about 340,000 serious crimes a year.
<p>	Nationally, state prisoners convicted of violent crimes who were released in 1988 had served an average of only 43 percent of their sentences in confinement. Violent convicts released in 1992 had served an average of 48 percent of their time behind bars. And violent offenders released from state prisons this year will have served, on average, 50 to 52 percent of their time in confinement. This slow but steady increase in incarceration is the result of a nationwide trend toward tougher sentencing policies, and has already spared millions of Americans from serious crimes.
<p>	It is not yet possible to calculate precisely how much tougher incarceration policies have contributed to falling crime rates in particular cities. But in explaining New York City's falling crime rate, consider the fact that roughly half of New York's state prison population, and an even larger fraction of its violent offender population, comes from New York City. Over the last decade, the Empire State's prison rolls have more than doubled, and the amount of time served behind bars by violent and repeat criminals has increased by as much as 50 percent.
<p>
<b>DiIulio's Law: Be Prepared</b>
<p>	Apparently, it takes a Ph.D. in criminology to doubt that keeping dangerous criminals incarcerated cuts crime and to wonder whether releasing any significant fraction of the nation's 1 million prisoners tonight would result in more serious crime tomorrow.
<p>	But criminologists are right about one thing: Americans are sitting on a demographic crime bomb. Most predatory street crimes are committed by men under 25. Today there are about 7.5 million males aged 14 to 17. By the year 2000, we will have an additional 500,000. About 6 percent of young males are responsible for half the serious crimes committed by their age group. Thus, in five years we can expect at least 30,000 more young murderers, rapists, and muggers on the streets than we have today. Worse, since the 1950s each generational cohort of young male criminals has committed about three times more crime than the one before. Despite the recent decline in murder rates, homicides committed by 14- to 17-year-olds between 1985 and 1993 increased by 165 percent (more for minority males). The next wave of homicidal and near-homicidal violence among urban youth is bound to reach adjacent neighborhoods, inner-ring suburbs, and even the rural heartland.
<p>	This crime bomb probably cannot be defused. The large population of seven- to 10-year-old boys now growing up fatherless, Godless, and jobless -- and surrounded by deviant, delinquent, and criminal adults -- will give rise to a new and more vicious group of predatory street criminals than the nation has ever known. We must therefore be prepared to contain the explosion's force and limit its damage.
<p>	While there is some room for reasonable disagreements about policy tactics -- for example, whether the federal role in crime control should be expanded, or whether we should invest more in drug treatment or drug interdiction -- any effective anti-crime policy must advance one or more of three interlocking anti-crime strategies: hardening targets, targeting the hardened, and targeting resources.
<p>	<b>Hardening the Target.</b> Over the last decade or so, most Americans have taken steps to make the places where they live, work, go to school, or recreate impervious to crime. People have moved out of high-crime neighborhoods, installed anti-burglary devices, made crime-sensitive investment decisions, and lectured their children to be mindful of dangers. Businesses and the 32 million Americans who now live in privately governed residential communities have erected security gates and employed more than a million private security guards. 
<p>	Neighborhoods of every socioeconomic description have formed "town watch" associations and citizen patrol groups. And the poorest of the inner-city poor have battled the ACLU for the right to target-harden their homes, schools, and parks: They erect concrete barriers on streets frequented by drug dealers and prostitutes, evict convicted street thugs from public housing, install metal detectors, and institute random locker searches in public high schools, and more.
<p>	Though to a degree hard to quantify, such initiatives have contributed to recent decreases in crime rates and, over time, insulated us somewhat from the failures of our system of justice. But as the next crime wave approaches, we may well be nearing the limit of what private target-hardening measures can do to foster public safety.
<p>	Government at all levels, therefore, should do whatever can be done to bolster these protective measures. To offer just two of many possible examples, urban zoning decisions should begin to take into account the criminal consequences of permitting liquor outlets to be so heavily concentrated in high-crime, inner-city neighborhoods. Likewise, urban enterprise zones make sense as ways of giving <i>de facto</i> tax credits to businesses willing to locate in high-crime places.
<p><b>Targeting the Hardened.</b> At the same time, we must redouble our efforts to keep violent and repeat criminals behind bars. To consolidate and expand recent gains, we must be vigilant not only in pushing for truth-in-sentencing and three-strikes measures, but seeing to it that these laws are followed both in letter and in spirit.
	<p>Make no mistake: The counter-offensive against tougher sentencing policies is well underway. Aided and abetted by activist federal judges, prisoners' rights activists, journalists, and academic "experts," efforts are already being made to depict these laws as failures and to deny or disparage any suggestion that they have helped account for recent drops in crime rates.
<p>	But just ask the criminals. In California this year, within several months after the three-strikes law went into effect, an increasing number of parolees began to request inter-state transfers. Likewise, even before Washington State's three-strikes law hit the books in 1993, dozens of sex offenders called the Seattle Police Department with questions about what crimes might count as "strikes." As one career criminal told the detective in charge of the department's sex-offender unit, "It wasn't until [the three-strikes law] passed that I had to say to myself, 'Damn, these people are serious now.'"
<p>	As the next crime wave draws near, we must remain deadly serious about targeting hardened adult and juvenile criminals for arrest, prosecution, and incarceration. Anti-incarceration propagandists can be counted on to work overtime with much-publicized tales like the one about the California man whose "third strike" was stealing a slice of pizza from a child in a mall. They failed to note, however, that this criminal had four prior convictions.
<p>	Likewise, the anti-incarcerationists are sure to repeat canards about how tougher sentencing policies will bankrupt the country and result in massive prison overcrowding. In truth, we now spend less than half a penny of every tax dollar on prisons, and the costs of prisons can be reduced greatly by cutting back on inmate amenities and services that account for more than half of the prison budget in many states. 
<p>	As for "overcrowding," despite the growth in the prison population, fewer prisons today are operating over their rated capacity (the number of inmates they were designed to hold) than in 1990. And contrary to popular assertions, there is no systematic empirical evidence to show that double-celling raises the risk of prison disorders, inmate illness, or other serious problems.
<p>	Congress is taking steps to target the hardened, as it considers Title III of the Violent Criminal Incarceration Act adopted by the House last February. Known as the Stop Turning Out Prisoners or STOP law, this measure would prohibit activist federal judges from arbitrarily imposing prison caps that result each year in the early release of tens of thousands of dangerous criminals whose return to the streets results in murder and mayhem.
<p><b>Targeting Resources.</b> Whatever government does henceforth to combat crime should be done in a targeted fashion. It makes no sense, for example, to heed President Clinton's call for spending $8.8 billion in federal dollars for "100,000 cops." As I and many other analysts have proven, not only will that amount not pay for or even seed the funding of anything near 100,000 police officers, but the Justice Department's grant process is rigged to deliver lots of money to small cities that have enough cops and little crime. By the same token, however, it makes even less sense to follow the Republican alternative of dumping more than $10 billion on the states in open-ended anticrime block grants.
<p>	So here is DiIulio's Law: Over the next five years, as our euphoria over good news about crime fades and a public panic to "do something" about youth crime begins, let us prepare to honor the overarching conservative principle that government should never spend money it does not have for purposes it has not clearly articulated in order to generate results that cannot easily be evaluated.

	The Legal Services Corp. (LSC) exists ostensibly to provide legal counsel in civil matters to people who cannot afford it. Since it was set up as a quasi-independent government corporation in 1974, it has weathered accusations that it promotes an activist, ideological agenda at the expense of its poor clients, and it has survived numerous attempts at abolition or reform.<p>
	Now the House Budget Committee, under the leadership of its chairman, Congressman John Kasich of Ohio, has proposed to phase out its annual appropriation, currently at $400 million, over the next two years. American Bar Association President George Bushnell has defended the program and has called LSC critics "reptilian bastards." Numerous defenders of the LSC have taken to the floor of Congress to denounce proposals to trim funding for the agency on the grounds that without it, America's poor will be deprived of civil legal representation.<p>
	We offer a twofold answer. First, Americans should realize that the LSC is not the noble bulwark of the rights of the poor that its supporters claim. Its effectiveness at serving the poor has always been marred by its pursuit of a political agenda that wastes effort and money and at times works to the long-term detriment of the poor. <p>
	Second, alternatives to the LSC do exist. Private legal-aid societies predated federally-funded legal services by almost 90 years, and would be thriving today had the lure of federal money not ensnared many of them. Other alternatives flourish in spite of the hostility of groups such as LSC grantees and the organized bar.<p>
	On a political level, the legal-services "movement," as it styles itself, is a 30-year success story. Since its founding as part of Lyndon Johnson's "War on Poverty," it has pursued its agenda virtually unimpeded. It has withstood budget cuts and a challenge to its existence in the Reagan years, when it waged an extensive "survival campaign." During the 1990s, it has enjoyed increasing appropriations. Its grantees receive an additional $255 million per year (as of 1993) from state and local governments, money from interest on many accounts that lawyers hold in trust for their clients (known as IOLTA funds), and private sources. Its biggest achievement, however, has been securing astronomical amounts of money for recipients of government programs. The movement, however, must face up to a crisis even greater than Republican opposition in Congress: The entire rationale for its existence is flawed:<p>
	<b>Misunderstood needs.</b> The LSC was created to provide help in civil cases. Most legal problems that poor people face fall into several basic categories: family law, including divorce, custody, guardianship, and child-support issues; housing, including disputes between landlords and tenants; financial issues, including bankruptcy, wills, estates, and credit problems; employment law; public benefits; prisoner rights; and immigration.<p>
  LSC supporters say that if it were not for the LSC, the 1.6 million poor people it assisted last year would be without any legal recourse whatsoever. The LSC itself proclaims its inadequacy to meet the needs of the poor by asserting that demand for its services vastly outstrips the $400 million provided by the federal government. The agency pleads for ever-increasing amounts of money on the basis of studies conducted by the American Bar Association (ABA) and in several states. These studies purport to show that only a minority of the legal needs of the poor are being met. The state studies asserted that the range was 14 to 23 percent of need.<p>
	Their methodology appears defective, however, because they fail to distinguish between "unmet" and "unrecognized" legal needs. Poor people were contacted randomly by phone, mail, or in person and asked whether they had problems in various areas, such as housing. If they responded that they had a problem with roaches, for instance, it was counted as an unmet legal need, even if the person had no intention of involving a lawyer in solving the problem. Under the consumer category, the most frequent problem cited was "turned down for credit." Many people are denied credit, but very few hire a lawyer. Yet, these responses were considered unmet legal needs.<p>
	<b>Misdirected agenda.</b> Even if we took these claims at face value, it's not hard to see why LSC resources don't go very far, because many LSC grantees have other plans for their money. Sixteen LSC grantees known as "support centers" provide virtually no direct legal services to the poor. They are organized to address specific issues such as housing, welfare, immigration, youth, and food. National in scope, the support centers often initiate litigation far from their offices. In 1993, the San Francisco-based National Center for Youth Law forced Arkansas to expand its child welfare system, and won $314,107 in legal fees for itself in the process. <p>	The real agenda of the federal legal-services program is "law reform." It is not to serve the needs of poor individuals, but to "rescue" the poor as a class from poverty through litigated increases in transfer payments. However well-intentioned, this mission suffers from the same contradiction as the "War on Poverty" itself. The welfare state has not led men and women out of poverty but instead created dependency and a permanent underclass. As long as the LSC dedicates itself to bolstering and expanding the welfare state, it will fail to "meet the needs" even as it defines them itself.<p>	Nevertheless, federally-funded legal services pursues its goal of law reform to effect a redistribution of income. Through class-action suits and lawsuits against local, state, and federal governments, LSC grantees have won hundreds of billions of dollars in expanded rights to welfare, Medicaid, and food-stamp benefits. In recent years, LSC grantees have sought to protect earlier gains by filing suits to obstruct or stop welfare reform in nearly every state in which it has been attempted. Yet a consensus seems to exist among political parties that the current welfare system has been eroding the family and fostering dependency for more than a generation. Expansion of benefits under the current system hardly seems like a compassionate cause on behalf of the poor.<p>	After year
s of abetting dependency by winning more social welfare benefits for more classes of people, LSC grantees have turned to pursuits overtly destructive of the poor. In dozens of cities, the legal-services movement has prevented local public-housing authorities from evicting drug dealers. LSC grantees have signed up thousands of alcoholics and substance abusers for Social Security Disability Insurance benefits. They have also litigated to protect aggressive panhandling and to establish the right to camp in city parks and streets. Some legal-services litigation has undermined parental rights and family cohesion. For example, some LSC grantees have sued to force housing authorities to lease apartments to unmarried minors.<p>	
<b>Bureaucratic structure.</b> The LSC is wedded to providing services by the so-called "staff attorney" model, which is essentially a bureaucratic model. A legal-services office is manned by lawyers who are employed by the program. An indigent person walks in the door, describes his or her problem, and a legal-services attorney decides whether to take the case. The LSC grantee is under no obligation to render assistance, and often does not. Instead of setting priorities in response to individual needs, LSC grantees may select cases according to their potential for advancing a social agenda.<p><b>A Prime Alternative </b><p>	In evaluating how the LSC is doing, it is worthwhile to look at two groups in Indianapolis that provide legal help to the poor. The Indianapolis Legal Aid Society (ILAS) was founded in 1941 and last year received all of its $458,000 budget from private sources, primarily the United Way. The Legal Services Organization of Indiana (LSOI), on the other hand, was founded in 1966 as part of the federal legal-services program. Last year it received 84 percent of its $4.5 million budget in grants from the LSC, and another 12 percent from other government sources.<p>
	One might think that the group with the larger budget does a more effective job serving the poor. Unfortunately, it does not. In 1994, ILAS handled 6,079 cases while LSOI says that it handled 12,347. (A LSOI brochure complains that it was forced to reject over 6,000 additional cases "due to budgetary restraints.") The private group handled one-half as many cases on one-tenth of the LSC grantee's budget. That works out to an expenditure of $75 per case for ILAS and $367 for LSOI.<p>
	A closer look at these figures, however, may point to an even greater disparity. The ILAS figure of 6,079 includes only those cases that were actually contested, whether they went to trial or not. It does not include consultations and referrals. On the other hand, the LSOI figure of 12,347 appears to include brief consultations and the like. It reported to the LSC that it closed only 1,273 litigated cases in 1994! <P>
	ILAS materials state that it is "non-partisan and non-ideological" and does not engage in class-action suits. On the other hand, LSOI employs a full-time lobbyist and has, for example, filed a class action suit to stop implementation of Indiana governor Evan Bayh's welfare-reform plan.<p>
	Another difference is that ILAS does not take cases on behalf of individuals seeking benefits under government welfare programs. Public-benefits cases are a significant part of the LSOI caseload, and they are sometimes zealously pursued. For instance, LSOI sued Indiana in 1993 to continue AFDC benefits to a parent even though her children had been removed from the home because she failed to exercise responsibility for their care. <p>
<b>Life after the LSC</b><p>	The most remarkable thing about the private ILAS is that it exists at all. Private legal-aid societies like ILAS numbered in the hundreds across the country until the 1960s, when the federal government began offering direct grants to legal aid organizations <a href="#destroy">(See sidebar)</a>. ILAS was in the minority that resisted. Since 1974, each LSC grantee has enjoyed automatic refunding. The money flows to the same agencies, often administered by the same personnel, year after year. The system has never employed competitive grant procedures. Only a handful of programs have been defunded, and the LSC has not even tried to defund one since 1986. Scant evidence exists of innovation or experimentation with different approaches to meeting the legal needs of the poor. Luckily, others within the legal profession are meeting the challenge.<p>
	 <b>Expanded "judicare."</b> A preferable alternative to the LSC's staff attorney model is "judicare," offering legal services based on the so-called British System. Under judicare, an indigent client employs the private attorney of his or her choice, who is reimbursed by the government in accordance with a set schedule of fees. The LSC has funded only a few judicare programs, presumably because they offer little opportunity to practice so-called law reform.
<p>	In 1983, long-time judicare advocate Samuel Jan Brakel made his case this way: "What point or purpose is there in having a separate legal-aid establishment for the poor, staffed overwhelmingly by young and inexperienced lawyers, armed with a socio-political agenda and a whole folklore about what poor clients want, need, or what is good for them? Why patronize low-income people in this way? Why deprive them of the diversity of views, practices, and talents that abound in the private sector? Why deny them the right to choose their own lawyers? In no other area of social or human service that I am aware of have we made such a concerted, almost perverse, effort to avoid using the resources already existent and available."<p>
	In South Carolina, the LSC funds a judicare program called Legal Services of the Fourth Judicial District. This is an excellent model for private legal aid to the poor. Covering six counties, the program contracts with fifty-two private attorneys who receive referrals from a staff member in each county. According to the South Carolina Bar Foundation, last year the other five LSC programs in the state budgeted between 42 percent and 50 percent of their resources to direct client services, whereas the Fourth Judicial District group budgeted 68 percent.<p>
	Executive Director Robert Adams claims that he offers better service, too. "By offering the services of 52 panel attorneys, we feel the clients have access to a diversity of legal expertise instead of limiting them to a few staff attorneys." Adams also points out that new attorneys starting practices in small communities have benefited and have seen clients return as paying clients. Adams also notes that "our program has never been involved in class action suits, abortions, or fee generating cases."<p>
	<b><i>Pro bono</i> legal work.</b> While overstating legal needs of the poor, LSC proponents understate services that are already available, particularly in the amount level of <i>pro bono</i> legal work. <i>Pro bono</i> is a shortening of <i>pro bono publico</i> which means "for public good." It refers to legal help rendered to a client by a private attorney for no fee or a reduced fee.
<p>	The LSC underplays the amount of free legal work that is done in order to aggrandize the agency's importance. In May 1995, LSC chairman Douglas Eakeley and LSC president Alex Forger testified in Congress that 130,000 attorneys do <i>pro bono</i> work. But this figure is the number of attorneys who are formally enrolled in organized pro bono programs affiliated with LSC grantees.<p>
	The actual number doing <i>pro bono</i> work, including work on an ad hoc basis, is much higher. Although no national study exists, studies in individual states provide some useful data. A 1991 study by the State Bar of California reported that 64 percent of its members engaged in some form of voluntary, uncompensated legal work. A 1994 New York State Bar Association report put the figure at 49 percent. The American Bar Foundation places the total number of attorneys in the United States in 1995 at 896,000. If one adopts a rather conservative assumption that at least 40 percent engage in <i>pro bono</i> work, the number is 358,400, between two and three times the number cited by Eakeley and Forger.
<p>	Eakeley and Forger went on to testify that "<i>pro bono</i> services from private attorneys are at an all-time high primarily because of the efforts of the organized bar, the LSC, and local programs to involve private attorneys in the delivery of legal services." They were correct in pointing out that <i>pro bono</i> is at an all time high, but wrong to award the LSC a central role. During the 1980s, the ABA put a new stress on attorneys' <i>pro bono</i> obligation. A 1988 ABA resolution asked all attorneys to devote at least 50 hours per a year. An ABA directory of <i>pro bono</i> programs published in 1984 had 300 entries. The 1993-94 edition contained over 900 programs and indicates that no more than 375 of the programs are substantially supported by LSC grantees. (Some grantees are involved with more than one program.) Thus, the majority of <i>pro bono</i> programs would exist without the LSC and they are today more numerous than all the programs existing in 1984.
<p>	The LSC's involvement with <i>pro bono</i> largely stems from a somewhat modest attempt in the 1980s by the Reagan-appointed LSC board to provide competition to the staff-attorney system. Grantees were required to establish a "private-attorney involvement program," on which they must spend 12.5 percent of their annual federal grant. The attitude of the legal-services "movement" toward pro bono has often been hostile. Some LSC <i>pro bono</i> programs are notoriously inefficient. For instance, Legal Services Organization of Indiana managed to spend $408,867 in 1994 on a program that supposedly relied on voluntary help. It closed just 668 cases at an average cost of $612 per case.
<p>	Legal-services groups can only assist clients whose annual income is within 125 percent of the poverty level. Often, individuals cannot afford a lawyer, but have incomes which exceed this level. For example, Bay Area Legal Services, the LSC grantee in Tampa, Florida, was turning away a hundred legitimate cases a week because the clients earned too much. In response, 35-year-old real-estate attorney Mike Bedke sought to address the problem by launching the Courthouse Assistance Project. Except for office space provided by the Clerk of the Hillsborough County Court, the program receives no government support. It is staffed by volunteer attorneys who help 300 individuals per month right in the Courthouse on a first-come, first-served basis. Attorneys answer questions, help people fill out forms, and tell them what to expect in court. According to Bedke, "A lot of times we don't even have to help them file a lawsuit. It's a matter of resolving a dispute over the phone, writing a letter for them, or directing them to a particular agency."<p>
	Bedke, a board member of Bay Area Legal Services, says that Bay Area directors worried that the new program would compete for resources, but that he has found a "new class" of volunteers to staff the project. Bedke explains that many attorneys felt that Bay Area represented "welfare queens" and that they are much more willing to help clients who have jobs and are trying to get ahead. Through his position as chairman of the ABA's Young Lawyers Division, Bedke has been seeking to spread the program to other cities; so far 14 have emulated the Tampa project. Another two dozen have expressed interest.
<P>	Bedke says part of his inspiration came from a six-year-old Richmond, Virginia, project aimed specifically at the working poor. Hunton & Williams, the largest law firm in southeastern United States, opened an office in a basement in a distressed Richmond neighborhood.<p>
	Last year, the office handled about 600 client representations for a flat $50 fee, plus out-of-pocket expenses. For every reduced-fee client representation, the office handled two to three more consultations free of charge, usually resulting in some resolution short of legal action or a referral to another agency. Clients may earn up to twice the LSC eligibility level, although eligibility is not strenuously investigated, freeing time for the staff to work on actual cases. According to George H. Hettrick, a partner in the firm, "We believe the $50 fee is a good thing for the client. That person feels like a real client and not the recipient of charity. When people are given dignity, it fosters a more successful lawyer-client relationship."
<p>	The Hunton & Williams office in Church Hill receives no government support whatsoever. It is staffed by 60 of the firm's lawyers, who put in an average of 40 to 60 hours per year. The office handles housing, family, and guardianship cases, three types of cases shunned by private attorneys. In the housing category, the office not only handles landlord/tenant disputes, but also closings for first time home buyers, and the closings for the new owners of homes built or rehabilitated by Habitat for Humanity and other housing programs.
<p>
	<b>Alternative dispute resolution.</b> More and more poor people are avoiding legal services altogether by turning to Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). Informal ADR procedures like conciliation, arbitration, and mediation have enjoyed explosive growth in recent years. <p>
	The programs run the gamut from taxpayer-supported programs affiliated with state court systems to private, neighborhood programs. In New York, all 62 counties now have a Community Dispute Resolution Center. Each center is a private, nonprofit agency with a contract with the state court system. The program was established in 1981 with the support of both liberals and conservatives in the state legislature. By 1988, every county had one. Each currently receives up to 50 percent of its budget from the state. The balance is raised from local governments and private sources, like the United Way. New York will provide a total of $3.1 million for fiscal year 1995. 
<p>	Administered by a staff of four in Albany, the program depends on 2,254 trained volunteer mediators from all walks of life, including housewives and retirees. Most are nonlawyers. By any measure, the statistics quoted by the program's statewide office are impressive. In fiscal year 1994, the centers conducted 25,015 conciliations, mediations, and arbitrations involving 63,210 people. The first step is conciliation, where an attempt is made to work out the problem by phone or mail. If that doesn't work, the parties actually meet face-to-face with a mediator present. In 79 percent of the matters that reached the mediation stage, a voluntary agreement was reached. If there is still no resolution, the parties go to arbitration. <P>
	In fiscal year 1994, it took 16 days from the intake to final disposition for the average single-hearing case and 41 days for the average multi-hearing case. There were 13,609 cases involving a single hearing and just 623 requiring more than one. The average time per mediation or arbitration was one hour and 11 minutes. The average cost to the state for each case screened as appropriate for dispute resolution was $68. The average state cost per conciliation, mediation, and arbitration was $121. The centers reported $2,919,276 awarded in fiscal year 1994 in restitution and through mutual agreements. The average award per case was $788.
<p>	The centers are open to anyone. State courts make both voluntary and mandatory referrals, accounting for about half of the caseload. Clients may seek advice from lawyers, but very few disputants use them. A review of the disputes handled shows that they include those common to the poor. Thirty-four percent involved allegations of harassment, 24 percent alleged breach of contract, 7 percent housing, 7 percent interpersonal disputes, 7 percent assault, 4 percent personal or real property, and 4 percent custody, support, or visitation.<p>
	Interestingly, many dispute-resolution programs handle minor criminal cases. Thus, the approach to dispute resolution is comprehensive. Its goal is to prevent the escalation of problems, especially among people who know each other. A mutually acceptable resolution of a simple trespass case can prevent an assault later on. Sixteen percent of the disputes were between neighbors, 15 percent between acquaintances, 13 percent between tenants and landlords, 9 percent between consumers and merchants, 6 percent between family members, 4 percent between former boyfriends and girlfriends, and 4 percent between strangers. <p>
	According to the National Institute for Dispute Resolution, 27 states have formally incorporated various ADR methods into their court systems, up from just 10 in 1980. The National Center for State Courts reports that at least 1,200 programs around the nation are receiving referrals from state courts.
<p>	 One doesn't have to live in New York to take advantage of ADR. "Neighborhood justice centers" now exist in many urban areas around the country. Some receive support from local governments and some are privately funded. Some receive referrals from local courts and some do not. What they have in common is a minimum of bureaucracy and a reliance on volunteers to serve as third-party referees. The federal role in the development of these institutions is instructive. In 1978, the Justice Department dispensed 18-month seed grants to three neighborhood justice programs in Kansas City, Atlanta, and Los Angeles. Smaller grants were also provided for another year of operation. But in contrast to the automatic refunding enjoyed by LSC grantees, the programs were on their own in the third year. The programs survived and centers in other cities blossomed with no federal seed money at all. Today, there are several hundred community and neighborhood justice centers. The National Association for Community Mediation has 150 programs in 37 states.<p>
<b>	Services by nonlawyers.</b> Along with ADR, nonlawyer practice (NLP) is growing rapidly. Independent paralegals and other specialists are performing tasks previously reserved for licensed attorneys. Nonlawyer practitioners handle such matters as uncontested divorces, wills, estates, bankruptcies, real estate closings, child custody and support, and immigration problems. They appear before 38 federal agencies. Many LSC-eligible clients take advantage of these services. Help Abolish Legal Tyranny (HALT), a Washington-based legal reform advocacy group, estimates that 5,000 independent paralegals (paralegals not employed by an attorney) are currently working in private practice. 
<p>	There would be more if not for the bitter opposition of state bar associations. These powerful groups lobby for "unauthorized practice of law" (UPL) statutes, which are on the books in every state except Arizona. The vast majority of UPL complaints are not filed by dissatisfied consumers, but by members of the bar. Not only has for-profit NLP been targeted for formal complaints, but also individuals and non-profit organizations that have been helping the poor. The most celebrated case is that of Rosemary Furman, a legal secretary who escaped going to jail in the mid-1980s. Her crime was to charge a small fee for helping battered women fill out civil protection orders and divorce forms. HALT says that it gets an average of two calls per week from nonlawyers being investigated or charged under UPL.<p>
	The LSC has fought competition from nonlawyers. In Jacksonville, Florida, nonlawyer Susan Longley operated American Legal Clinic, Inc., now known as American Documents Clinic, Inc. Among other things, Longley assisted people in the preparation of Chapter 13 bankruptcy filings. She handled a filing for Sandra Samuels for $215, saving her home from foreclosure. Jacksonville Area Legal Aid, Inc., an LSC grantee, soon after launched a successful UPL action against Longley, and in December 1994 was awarded $5,316.20 in legal fees even though the judge found that the client had not been harmed in any way.<p>
	In response to the NLP phenomena, the ABA formed a Commission on Nonlawyer Practice scheduled to make a report in 1996, but most state bar association officials remain deadset against any increased role for NLP. Most argue that clients are put at risk by nonlawyers handling legal problems. But former New Jersey Bar President Thomas Curtin was quoted in the July 3, 1995, <i>Lawyers Weekly</i>, "I have no difficulty saying my position is protecting the interests of lawyers. Why is the ABA, an organization that is supposed to working for lawyers, trying to find work for nonlawyers? That is not the business of the ABA. This is the American Bar Association, not the American Paralegal Association."
<p>	<b>Do-it-yourself.</b> In her unsuccessful fight to offer legal services, Longley was also enjoined from using any computer program or legal form designed for use by attorneys. It is easy to see why lawyers are concerned about these tools. Self-help legal publications and computer programs are enjoying expanded sales. Ralph Warner, the editor of NOLO Press of Berkeley, California, estimates that how-to legal publications are now a $50 million business. One of NOLO's most popular titles is "How to File for Bankruptcy." Another is "Plan Your Estate." Its most popular software package, allowing individuals to create their own wills, sold 60,000 last year. <p><b>What to Do?</b>
<p>	The best thing the government can do for the poor is to do away with the LSC. The agency won't go willingly, so Congress should abolish it. Additionally, care should be exercised in replacing it with something else. The potential of unintended consequences is a central lesson of the last 30 years. A number of ideas have been proposed, but should be discarded: <p><ul>	<li>"Reform" of the Legal Services Corp. No new regulations or restrictions can reform a program founded on a flawed premise <a href="#reform">(see sidebar)</a>. <li>A federal judicare program. The last thing the country needs is Medicare for lawyers. State and locally-funded judicare programs are worthy of support, particularly in rural areas.<li>Block grants to the states. Preferable to the present LSC-grant system, they may be useful during a phase out of federal funding. Block grants pose the danger, however, of preserving a federal role in legal services.<li>Mandatory <i>pro bono. Pro bono</i> should not result from coercion. It is a violation of attorneys' free association rights and undercuts the voluntary spirit necessary for successful <i>pro bono</i> work.</ul><p>
	How then should the legal needs of the poor be met? First, it should be recognized that there are certain needs the poor don't have. Without deep pockets, they seldom get sued. When injured or harmed due to the negligence of others, there is no need for a taxpayer-provided lawyer. All a victim has to do is to call the number on the television screen. Plenty of private lawyers await with open arms to take contingency cases.<p>
	Second, it should also be recognized that many of the present legal problems of the poor do not require lawyers. Deregulation of the legal profession will provide disproportionate relief to the poor. ADR and NLP are well suited for many of the kinds of problems the poor encounter.<p>
	Third, legal needs which actually require a lawyer should not be established on the basis of self-serving and nonsensical studies sponsored by federal grant recipients. It may be impossible to quantify legal needs in the first place. In our lawyer-rich society, legal problems are whatever clever lawyers decide to bring forth. Actual needs can only be established by poor people themselves exercising free choice. A federal income-tax deduction for <i>Pro bono</i> work would help make the system client-based, rather than attorney-based. Such an incentive was proposed by GOP Congressman Henry Hyde of Illinois in the early 1980s with a monetary cap on the total deduction. 
<p>	The good news is that an expansion of <i>pro bono</i> work is already underway and the legal profession has been aggressively promoting it, notwithstanding ABA support for the LSC. Ending the federal legal-services program would further oblige attorneys to assist the poor. The existence of a federal program has undoubtedly provided some attorneys with the rationale to shirk responsibilities in their own communities. A federal income tax deduction is not a panacea, however. The success of <i>pro bono</i> should not be dependent on the availability of a tax deduction, but on a renewal of the voluntary spirit of members of the bar.<p>
	 Many attorneys will be more likely to engage in <i>pro bono</i> in a structured program, and there are many areas where a storefront, walk-in office would a tremendous convenience for the poor and working poor. As is being demonstrated in Indianapolis, a private institution can serve the poor better than a public one. We should work to restore the ethos of the private legal-aid society that not dependent on government funds.<p>
	Indeed, the private legal-aid society can serve as a useful model for LSC grantees if they should lose federal funding. The transition to a nonfederal system will not be tumultuous. As noted, LSC grantees already receive $255 million from non-LSC sources. Unlike other federal programs, LSC grantees may carry over surpluses each year, and some programs have significant reserves socked away. A simple policy decision to stop doing class-action suits, public-benefits cases, advocacy, and lobbying would allow most grantees to help more poor individuals, even on a reduced budget. If programs are truly providing a valuable service, they should be able to raise money locally.<p>
	Ultimately, legal services for the poor cannot be separated from legal services for everyone. Problems of affordability and accessibility are not limited to the poor or working poor. Our society threatens to become "overrun by hordes of lawyers, hungry as locusts," as Warren Burger, the late chief justice of the Supreme Court, put it. Reducing litigation and lowering its cost through tort reform and other measures would benefit everyone. Getting lawyers out of lives of Americans, including the poor, is the real point.

<blockquote>
<a name="destroy"><b>The Destruction of Legal-Aid Societies </b></a><br>
	The Legal Aid Society of New York was the nation's first, opening its doors with one part-time attorney in 1876. Private societies numbered more than 200 by the mid-1960s and, except in a few municipalities, received no government support. Overall, about 60 percent of their financial support came from community chests, 15 percent from bar associations, and the rest from individuals and businesses.
<p>	An 89-year-old tradition of private legal aid ended in 1965 when the federal government began making direct grants to legal-aid organizations through the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), a cornerstone of Lyndon Baines Johnson's "War on Poverty." The previously private societies constituted 60 percent of the grantees of the new  federal program. 
<P>	With federal funding came dramatic change. Sargent Shriver's OEO spearheaded a shift in emphasis to "law reform," the expansion of poverty benefits through litigation. The directors and staffs of many programs resented Washington setting local priorities, but were quickly overwhelmed. The law gave the OEO powers to award grants to antipoverty agencies on any basis. <p>
	The introduction of federal funds provided huge power to the small but highly ideological OEO staff to set priorities and demand changes in local organizations. Few local aid societies and bar organizations could resist the allure of new federal funds. The annual budgets of the private legal-aid societies totaled about $4 million in 1964. The federal program initially promised an annual expenditure 10 times that amount to groups administered or heavily influenced by local bar groups. In cases where the existing legal-aid operation refused to remake itself to the OEO's liking, a competing organization was founded and funded instead. By 1967, the OEO was distributing $42 million to 300 organizations. The OEO's crash campaign resulted in a network of law offices and attorneys equal in size to the U.S. Department of Justice and all its U.S. Attorney offices.  <p>
	The OEO placed its own personnel in programs it funded through something called the Reginald Heber Smith Fellowship Program. Beginning in 1967, young attorneys were recruited and trained in the principles and tactics of "poverty law." Sent out to local grantees, the "Reggies" remained employees of the Smith program.<p>
	By 1971, 25 percent of all LSC lawyers were graduates of the program. Fred Speaker, an OEO official at the time, expressed the OEO attitude to the formerly private groups: "We are a program that six years ago rose out of the sloth of token, tired, 19th-century legal-aid societies." Private institutions were not just crowded out by public ones, but were actively undermined and infiltrated in a campaign akin to a corporate takeover.<p>	 "Law reform" proceeded at a furious pace. By 1972, some 219 cases had been brought all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court by LSC attorneys. Under the former private system, not one case had ever gone that far. Through the end of 1972, some $290 million in federal funds had been spent on legal services, but the cost to the taxpayer was actually more than $2 billion. 
<P>	In 1973, President Nixon proposed to dismantle the OEO, and appointed as its director Howard Phillips, who promptly canceled "law reform" as a goal. Congressional supporters of legal services moved to "insulate" the program from "political pressure" and sought to establish an independent Legal Service Corp. (LSC), along the lines of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Richard Nixon signed the Legal Services Corp. Act on July 25, 1974the last legislation he signed before resigning. During congressional hearings this year, LSC officials pointed out that Nixon created the LSC, but they did not mention that liberal senators were holding up funds for his Watergate defense at the time.<p>
	The new LSC has dispensed funds in much the same way as the OEO did. According to Indiana University Law Professor William F. Harvey, a director of the Indianapolis Legal Aid Society and chairman of the LSC during the 1980s, "The effort to undermine the private legal-aid societies continued under the LSC, particularly during the chairmanship of Hillary Rodham Clinton [1978-80]. The Washington-based LSC ideologues cannibalized the standards, criteria, the concepts, even the esprit de corps of America's legal-aid societies."

<hr length=70%> <blockquote>
<a name="reform"><b>Why the LSC Cannot Be Reformed (sidebar)</b></a><br>
	Responding to criticism of the Legal Services Corp. (LSC), the agency's defenders in Washington favor reform over elimination. But the LSC is not reformable. The Legal Services Corp. Act of 1974, which created the corporation, allows it to take public funds$400 million this yearand transforms them into private funds, immune from the checks that apply to other types of federal spending.
<p>	The law also established a unique, hybrid structure for the corporation that guarantees it can never be accountable. The LSC is an independent, private, nonprofit corporation that makes grants to 323 separately incorporated private nonprofit grantees. The LSC's 11-member board is appointed by the president, subject to Senate confirmation, but the board has little actual influence over the grantees and how they spend their grants. Nor does the executive branch have much influence over the LSC budget. By law, it goes straight from the LSC to Congress, and the Office of Management and Budget may only review it.<p>
	The LSC's status as a private corporation exempts it from many federal criminal laws pertaining to government officials, such as the Anti-Deficiency Act. Although it is a felony for a federal official to misappropriate federal funds, the LSC Act frustrates operation of that law by declaring that "officers and employees of the Corporation shall not be considered officers and employees" of the federal government.<p>
	From time to time, Congress and the LSC board have sought in vain to exercise oversight. Restrictions on LSC involvement in abortion, Congressional redistricting, politics, lobbying, and advocacy have been ignored or circumvented, primarily through the nonfederal funds "dodge." Since most grantees receive some funding from IOLTA and state and local governments, they are able to claim that any restricted activities are not done with their LSC funds.<p>
	There is no way to verify this because legal-services attorneys do not keep time sheets, thereby eliminating the only means of federal oversight. Furthermore, legal-services lawyers do not report the cases on which they work to anyone beyond their offices, and all case records are off limits. This secrecy, shielded by an invocation of the attorney-client privilege, prevents Congress from evaluating the effectiveness of any legal-services program. There are no provisions for the privilege to be waived for purposes of oversight, even though the overseers have paid for the services. <p>
	As a result of these factors, we have little information on expenditures by case or by category or service. While most government programs are required to have detailed accounting systems to explain how taxpayer money is used, the LSC has continued to ask for funding increases without offering any detailed evidence that previous funding has been used well.<p>
	The LSC can track the use of its grants through a monitoring program that includes on-site visits by Washington-based staff. During the Bush administration, about 125 visits took place annually, meaning the average program could expect a visit once every three years. Under the Clinton-appointed board, only six monitoring visits took place last year.<p>
	The LSC structure is ripe for abuse, and abuses will be rampant as long as it exists. It makes little difference who is in the White House, the Congress, or on the LSC board. As long as funds flow through the 323 LSC grantees, public funds will continue to be spent by private citizens pursuing a private political agenda. As Alan Houseman, a legal theorist who helped draft the 1974 Act, wrote in 1984, "Since the central directions of the program were not created by statutes or regulations, they are invariably difficult to undo by regulations and LSC policies."

Dear Senator:

I encourage you to act in favor of the self-employed and 
small business owners by embracing reform of the status of 
independent contractors. I urge you to support and 
co-sponsor H.R. 1972, the "Independent Contractor Tax 
Simplification Act," introduced by Congressman Jon 
Cristensen (R-NE). 

H.R. 1972 simplifies the tax relationship between the 
business and the independent contractor by defining who is 
not an employee. 

This bill outlines clear, distinct criteria for those 
seeking to perform services as an independent contractor. 
As you are probably aware, independent contractors and small
business owners are presently forced to comply with the 
infamous 20-factor test - an ambiguous tool of the IRS which
lures independent contractors into a spiral of unnecessary 
legalese and expense. 

Many entrepreneurs and small business owners do not have the
time or resources to fight the 20-factor test, some of these 
job producers are forced to close their doors. One recent 
estimate that the IRS reclassified 439,000 independent 
contractors and collected $678 million in fines and back 
taxes over the past several years. 

Clearly there is an institutional bias for the IRS to 
reclassify independent contractors as employees. It would 
be intolerable if Congress failed to pursue reform of the 
20-factor test. 

Small businesses and entrepreneurs, the largest job creators
of our economy, should not be forced to comply with an 
unending string of arbitrary and outdated IRS rules. The 
20-factor test is a prime example of bad tax policy. I 
strongly support Congressman Christensen's bill and I ask 
you to do the same. 

Sincerely, 

</textarea>

For Immediate Release

<b><CENTER>Small Businesses Harboring Chemical Weapons?</CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>American Businesses To Be Subjected to Foreign Inspections
Under Proposed Chemical Weapons Convention<BR>
</CENTER>
</b>
<hr>
<P>
Washington, D.C. -- The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) has
goals worth supporting, but in the end it will harm U.S. national
security while subjecting private industry -- many of which are
small businesses -- to onerous new regulatory burdens, on-site
inspections by a new foreign entity with the real potential for
international industrial espionage, according to a small business
watchdog group.  The U.S. Senate has scheduled a CWC ratification
vote on September 14.<BR>
<P>
&quot;Our assessment of the CWC is one of great apprehension and
concern for U.S. businesses.  We urge the U.S. Senate to take
a careful look at the treaty in terms of what American business
will be subjected to, and how our competitiveness is threatened
by new reporting requirements and on-site visits by Hague-based
foreign inspectors,&quot; commented Karen Kerrigan, President
of the Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC).<BR>
<P>
Nations that sign the CWC will agree to abide by the treaty whose
goals are to end the production and stockpiling of chemical weapons.
 Unfortunately, rogue nations like Iraq, Libya, Syria and North
Korea are not planning to sign the treaty.  Moreover, defense
and foreign policy experts view the CWC as non-enforceable and
non-verifiable.<BR>
<P>
As then-Director of the Central Intelligence Agency James Woolsey
stated before the Foreign Relations Committee in June of 1994:
  &quot;The chemical weapons problem is so difficult from an intelligence
perspective that I cannot state that we have high confidence in
our ability to detect noncompliance, especially on a  small scale.&quot;
<BR>
<P>
In order to comply with CWC provisions, new regulatory burdens
would be placed on already over-regulated U.S. businesses.  In
particular:<BR>
<UL>
<LI>U.S. private industry would be subjected to foreign inspections
at the direction of  Technical Secretariat overseeing the Organization
for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) located in the
Hague, Netherlands.
<LI>Businesses must prove to the U.S. government and international
inspectors that they are not producing or stockpiling chemical
weapons.  Chemical companies plus other businesses that use certain
chemicals in manufacturing processes must fill out new forms for
each chemical covered by the treaty.  Firms in food processing,
pharmaceutical, paint, petroleum, biotech, electronics, textiles,
rubber, brewing and distilling industries would be impacted as
well.
<LI>The. U.S. Department of Commerce estimates that it will take
anywhere from 2.5 - 9 hours to fill out the paperwork for each
chemical depending upon its classification.
<LI>Congress's Office of Technology Assessment estimated that
inspections will cost U.S. firms anywhere from $10,000 to $500,000
per visit.
<LI>Distinct possibilities exist that rights of due process could
be violated in relation to warrantless searches and personnel
being compelled to answer questions, and provide information and
access.
<LI>With the advent of foreign inspections, proprietary information
could be compromised hurting U.S. competitiveness.
</UL>
<P>
<P>
&quot;By all accounts the treaty is flawed, and we strongly urge
the U.S. Senate to take a sober look at the CWC.  We believe an
honest assessment of the treaty will reveal that the costs to
U.S. businesses, the loss of our economic freedom and compromising
constitutionally protected American rights do not justify ratification
-- especially with the prevalent belief that the treaty will harm
U.S. national security,&quot; said Kerrigan.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Seattle's Future: <BR>
Forward Thrust or Bust? </CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER><I>by Bruce Chapman</I> </CENTER>
</H3>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="nostarrule.gif" WIDTH="417" HEIGHT="4" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P>The danger in next month's capital improvements election--with the Seattle
Commons, neighborhood ball parks and a big outdoor ballpark for the Mariners
on the ballot--is not that voters of Seattle and King County will lack the
facts upon which to make a sound judgment. There will be plenty of healthy
debate. The real danger, especially for young voters and newcomers, is that
the choices may take place in an historical vacuum. <BR>
<BR>
The best argument for the bond issues is that, unlike so many federal, state
and even government promises, voters in this case can be fairly sure of
what they are getting for their money. They will be able to see the results.
But if they are skeptical, they might want to review what happened with
some other great decisions in Seattle history, including most recently,
&quot;Forward Thrust.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Even people who experienced it may have forgotten what that former citizens'
crusade did to make Seattle a better place to live. Indeed, our area today
is at a crucial point not unlike that of 27 years ago. The economic boom
back then had left many people worried, for the first time, that the area's
&quot;livability&quot; was threatened. Yet, voters may have been more optimistic
then, if only because family income was growing faster than it is now. <BR>
<BR>
In the short term, that optimism was somewhat unwarranted. Within a couple
of years after the first and determinative Forward Thrust election of 1968,
Seattle suffered the famous &quot;Boeing recession.&quot; In the subsequent,
less hopeful atmosphere of 1970, the remaining Forward Thrust proposals
that were put on that year's ballot were defeated. <BR>
<BR>
But then a wonderful thing happened--several wonderful things, really. The
Forward Thrust projects that King County residents had approved in the palmy
days of 1968 began development in the early 70's at just the right time
to help revive the economy. A spectacular series of civic improvements ensued,
including new parks, recreation and professional sports facilities, sanitation,
fire stations, a youth service center, and community centers. It was largely
due to the major Forward Thrust projects, and the many smaller projects
inspired by them, that Seattle started winning &quot;Most Livable City&quot;
awards over the following decade. A successful 1972 vote for a metropolitican
bus system (the often-forgotten third ballot vote of the Forward Thrust
series), and the state legislature's adoption of Forward Thrust measures
to modernize SeaTac Airport and our seaport added to the momentum. <BR>
<BR>
I was newly on the City Council then and delighted with the opportunities
Forward Thrust offered Seattle. Many of them were serendipitous and unanticipated.
For example, historic preservation had not been considered when the Forward
Thrust parks proposal was planned, but by 1972 we were able to use historic
preservation techniques to find new uses for old Seattle landmarks and to
save money on building some of the &quot;new&quot; facilities Forward Thrust
had promised. <BR>
<BR>
As for the parks themselves, Forward Thrust allowed Seattle area governments
to pick up properties for what we can now see were bargain prices. For example,
the land for Mercer Island's Luther Burbank Park, presently valued at $70
million, was acquired for all of $l.5 million. <BR>
<BR>
Though capital funds were relatively plentiful in the '70's, thanks to Forward
Thrust, maintenance funds were not. But Forward Thrust inspired City Hall
to find creative ways to close much of the gap. One way was to combine projects
in order to reduce overhead expenses. Merging the new aquarium with the
Waterfront Park is an example. <BR>
<BR>
We also found we could get some of the new parks actually to generate revenue
to offset their maintenance costs, as was the case again at Waterfront Park.
Re-using the existing old piers as part of the park design was entirely
in keeping with the park's theme, and it also permitted us to expand visitor
interest with shops and restaurants. And, ever since, these private concessions
have provided the city with rent and sales tax revenues. <BR>
<BR>
Due to the inspiration of the father of the Forward Thrust movement, Jim
Ellis, the city and county also learned how to leverage bond moneys to attract
public grants, private investments and gifts. These ranged from highway
funds and a new private building that helped make Freeway Park possible
to private flower garden donations for the park's operations. Thus, the
citizens of Seattle and King County actually got far more than they voted
for. How often does that happen with government? <BR>
<BR>
In fact, the total bond moneys of $330 million were nearly doubled by federal
and state public grants, along with private investments and gifts ($240
million), plus interest on the bonds ($55 million). Throw in the increased
property values of recent decades, and Forward Thrust turns out to have
been the best bargain for Seattleites since we built the City Light hydroelectric
dams at the turn of the century. <BR>
<BR>
People over 40 often ask what happened to the kind of enlightened and inventive
civic leadership that gave us Forward Thrust. Part of the answer is that
while contemporary Americans demand leadership, we denigrate leaders. We
are particularly cynical about motives now, even with citizen volunteers.
And then there is the problem of time. Back in the '60's, Jim Ellis expected
to spend less than two years on Forward Thrust and wound up devoting seven.
Today's extensive approval processes and other hurdles make public projects
exhausting for citizen leaders. <BR>
<BR>
But the rest of the answer to the leadership question is more heartening.
The truth is that both the Seattle Commons idea and the proposal to build
a new outdoor stadium initially arose from outside of government and have
elicited almost exactly the same quality of citizen spirit that gave us
Forward Thrust-or, earlier, the Century 21 World's Fair that left us the
Seattle Center. <BR>
<BR>
Over several years more than 2500 citizens from all walks of life have donated
personal time, financial contributions and talent to the Commons idea. At
first, there was not even any great interest from the organized business
community or from government. <BR>
<BR>
There is no hidden agenda. The uncommon Commons vision is persuasive because
it has just the right mix of boldness and prudence, like Forward Thrust.
The vision is to create 18,000 good new jobs, anchor a good share of the
city's new, multi-income housing growth at the south end of Lake Union,
with a landmark central park that everyone can use, and in the process help
reduce urban sprawl and traffic congestion. It will be a model of a more
sensible urban envirornment. <BR>
<BR>
As with Forward Thrust, the citizens who have thrown themselves into the
Commons effort have figured out how to blend many aims to produce a package
with wide appeal. The neighborhood ballparks are needed, though they are
not urgent. But the plan to use the Commons project as a means to solve
the near-legendary Mercer Street traffic mess is an excellent case of sound
multi-purpose planning. <BR>
<BR>
The Commons, if adopted, probably will excel Forward Thrust in attracting
private investments and and already has done so with philanthropic gifts
and loans. The Commons group also has figured out how to attract money from
outside the area. As an immediate consequence of approval of the Commons'
bonds, $18 million of bond funds will be used to secure matching state and
federal highway grants to widen the Mercer corridor and put it underground.
<BR>
<BR>
When you think of it, the Forward Thrust spirit is also alive in the unfairly-maligned
plan to build a Mariners ballpark. It, too, will be multi-purpose, not just
the place for a baseball fan to enjoy a soft summer night, but a place for
any of us, and our children, to enjoy a wide range of civic events and celebrations.
And thanks to an ingenious retractable roof, it will work regardless of
the weather. <BR>
<BR>
The ballpark proposal bespeaks the all too-unusual civic dedication of the
wealthy individuals who risked their own money--starting with the Japanese
owner of Nintendo who effectively gifted us with $50 million--to save the
local professional baseball team. That is what we now have on the line.
<BR>
<BR>
You don't put your money into a baseball team in Seattle to get rich (or
richer) these days, whatever you may tell your spouse. And you don't go
to endless Commons meetings to advance your career. Maybe you step forward
because you are nostalgic for your youth, or for the dreams you had of the
city you'd like to see, or maybe you are that old fashioned type of person
who believes in the concept of civic virtue. <BR>
<BR>
Whatever its source, we can't buy that kind of civic spirit at any price.
Like the citizens of the ancient Roman republic--or Seattle at the high
points of its history--we can only try to call it forth. <BR>
<BR>
This town has lots of other needs and opportunities beyond those on the
current ballot. But that is not a reason for discouragement. We also have
better prospects than we have ever enjoyed. Surely we would like to see
more of the newly wealthy Seattleites step up to the challenge of philanthropy
and to endow our next genereation with new civic advantages--in schools,
city beautification, housing, camps, museums, public gardens, transportation
amenities, music, medical care, and job opportunities. But, how do we entice
our new millionaires to play this role unless we honor those who do? <BR>
<BR>
This town, as part of its heritage, also probably has more than its fair
share of talented potential citizen leaders, regardless of financial resources,
good people of a new generation whose imagination, know-how and drive we
would like to enlist for our community's benefit. They will do the volunteer
chores others shirk. But what do we have to entice those individuals--other
than the respect we pay them by taking their efforts seriously? <BR>
<BR>
Is ours going to be the era of Forward Bust? Or are we headed for another
Forward Thrust, with all the good it can bring us? The September ballot
will not finally answer that question. But it can become an important sign
that civic confidence--and the calling forth of public service--is once
again ignited. It can light our way. <BR>
<BR>
If you doubt what such measures can do for a city, drive around. Many of
the best features of contemporary Seattle sprang from the public spirited
efforts of earlier citizens, including the Progressive Era generation at
the turn of the century who built our first comprehensive boulevard and
parks systems, the ship canals and locks, our exemplary water reservoirs
and power dams and the Denny Regrade. Those folks are all gone. <BR>
<BR>
But the Forward Thrust generation, most of them, are still here. From our
clean water to a vibrant cultural life, you also can see their works. The
point is that Seattle did not become the envy of the nation by accident.
Seattle citizens--with remarkable frequency--have made wise choices at the
right time. <BR>
<BR>
Just look around you.

<center><h2> Letter from the Chairman</h2></center>
<dd><big>A</big>fter the 1994 elections I predicted we would see the most outrageous performance ever from the leftist "news" media. Unfortunately I was right -- and it was even worse than I feared. They have turned public support against conservatives. 
<dd>Our goal in 1996 is to neutralize their impact    -- to convince the public not to believe the propaganda being pushed by the media. Early this year we will announce, at a national press conference, our <b><i>Tell the Truth!</i></b> campaign. We will demand that the national media begin -- begin -- to cover the political landscape fairly.
<dd> The <i>Tell the Truth!</i> campaign will start with the formal release of <b><i>Pattern of Deception: Bill Clinton and the National Media</i></b>. It's a devastating, systematic review of how the media have  promoted Bill Clinton from 1991 through 1995. 
<dd>Just as our first book, And That's the Way It Isn't, gave the MRC its credibility initially, this book will give credibility to our national campaign since the findings are explosive and irrefutable.
<dd>The <i>Tell the Truth!</i> <b>Blast Fax Campaign</b> will combine two of the most successful political techniques undertaken in recent years. In 1992 the Clinton campaign was absolutely ingenious with its rapid response teams. James Carville and Co. were everywhere in the national media responding to anything and everything the Republicans had to say on a moment's notice.
<dd>In 1993 Bill Kristol had a crushing impact on the national health care debate by identifying the top public policy leaders in the country and releasing a regular series of impactful fax reports. He was able to change the entire dynamic of the debate along lines of conservatives' concerns.
The <i>Tell the Truth!</i> Blast Fax Campaign will combine both techniques. We are putting together a list of approximately 1,500 top public policy leaders -- with their fax numbers in order to reach them on a regular basis with our blast fax campaign. 
<dd>When there are developments of outrageous media propaganda (which will happen on a regular basis) we will be shooting out blast faxes around the country to put the press on the defensive immediately. 
<dd>In 1996, teams of <i>Tell the Truth!</i> analysts will be in both parties' convention cities. There we will set up offices and publish a daily report exposing everything the press is doing to slant convention coverage. And by making an issue of convention coverage well in advance, we can neutralize the press if they intend to do in 1996 what they did to conservatives in 1992.
<dd>There will be a flurry of activity by us through the mainstream press.  I will continue to do my twice-weekly syndicated column as well as my weekly television commentary on the TCI television network, and will be writing a series of guest editorials on the subject for major publications like the <i>Wall Street Journal, National Review</i>, and <i>USA Today</i>.
<dd>As for our plans to neutralize the media during the presidential elections, we've got our bases covered. These plans are very expensive, however. So, we will be counting on your continued support throughout this very important election year, and I hope I can count on you.

<center><h2>The Bad and the Biased</h2>
<h3>The Best Notable Quotables of 1995</h3></center>
<h3>For a sampling of some of the awards, the envelope, please:</h3>
<p>
<dd><big>I</big>t has become a tradition at the Media Research Center to present an annual awards issue -- <b><i>The Best Notable Quotables of 1995 </i></b>-- to highlight the year's worst reporting. Each year dozens of conservative writers and talk show hosts gather together to "honor" those responsible for the most irresponsible comments.  
<dd><i>The Best Notable Quotables</i> is the MRC's most popular publication. It is reproduced in papers, the topic of conversation on radio and television talk shows across the country. 
<dd>So how do the media react to our awards?
It's not surprising that the few conservatives in the press are thrilled with our findings and use them for their own ammunition against the liberal media.
<dd><i>National Review</i> ran an excerpt from the <i>Best of Notable Quotables of 1995</i> in December. 
<dd>Mike Rosen, talk show host and columnist, ran excerpts from the <i>Best of Notable Quotables</i> recently in his column.
<dd>Ray Archer, editorial writer for <i>The Arizona Republic</i>, ran quotes from the <i>Best Notable Quotables</i>, and said this of our examples of the liberal media: "There's no dearth of venom spewed by those who typically tout the liberal line."
<dd>Jeff Jacoby, columnist for <i>The Boston Globe</i>, used an excerpt from the <i>Best of Notable Quotables</i> to prove his point in his column entitled, "How the right is demonized."
<dd>The Minneapolis <i>Star Tribune</i> ran a story on January 1 showing both sides of the media bias issue.  It's funny how the <i>Tribune</i> used all empirical, hard evidence from the <i>Best Notable Quotables of 1995</i> to back up our side, yet when it came to presenting Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting's -- FAIR, an organization which alleges <i>conservative</i> media bias -- position, the Tribune printed an opinion column from a FAIR employee, without, as usual, any evidence.
<dd>Not every story based on the <i>Best of Notable Quotables</i> was positive. 
<dd>Of course, we don't expect the "journalists" who win these awards to be happy that we've exposed their biases. 
<dd>Take Clarence Page, columnist and winner of <i>Notable Quotables'</i> year-end Award for Hypocritical Hate Mongering (for his claim that "most of the KKK ha[ve] joined the Republican Party"). He targeted the MRC and the Best Notable Quotables as the topic of a recent column which ran in the <i>Chicago Tribune.</i> 
<dd>He couldn't understand why anyone would take offense to his remark, and cited as evidence that membership in groups like the KKK had gone down during the `80s -- meaning that they were joining the Republican Party.  (How do you think liberals like Page would react if a conservative were to point out that membership in the Communist Party USA had declined in the `80s and that this meant that Communists were now supporting the Democratic Party?) 
<dd>For good measure, the peace-loving Mr. Page concluded his piece by calling supporters of the MRC -- "brownshirts."
<dd>For a full listing of the outlets which have carried our research recently, please turn to page <p>
<center><h3>We'll Decide Who's a Mean-Spirited Republican Award...</h3></center>
<p>
<dd>"The Republican  jihad against the poor, the young, and the helpless rolls on. So far no legislative assault has been too cruel, no budget cut too loathsome for the party that took control of Congress at the beginning of the year and  has spent all its time since then stomping on the last dying embers of idealism and compassion in government."
<p>
<i>--New York Times</i> columnist and former NBC reporter Bob Herbert.
<p>
<center><h3>But It's Okay for Us to Hate Them Award (for Hypocritical Hatemongering)</h3></center>
<p>
<dd>"Most of the KKK has joined the Republican Party. They don't have to be there."
<p>
-- <i>Chicago Tribune</i>'s Clarence Page, commenting on the Million Man March. Page has now written a nationally syndicated column attacking the MRC and <b>defending</b> that comment.
<p>
<center><h3>Damn Those Conservatives Award</h3></center>
<dd>"The scariest of all hobgoblins may be a fellow African American, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. In the four years since George Bush chose him to fill the 'black seat' vacated by Thurgood Marshall, Thomas has emerged as the high court's most aggressive advocate of rolling back the gains Marshall fought so hard for. The maddening irony is that Thomas owes his seat to precisely the kind of racial preference he goes to such lengths to excoriate."
<p>
-- <i>Time's</i> Jack E. White.
<p>
<center><h3> Republicans Make Us Sick Award</h3></center>
<dd>"Next week on ABC's <i>World News Tonight</i>, a series of reports on our environment which will tell you precisely what the new Congress has in mind: the most frontal assault on the environment in 25 years. Is this what the country wants?"
<p>
-- a Peter Jennings promotional spot.
<p>
<center><h3>Americans with Mathematical Disabilities Award (for Calling Hikes a Cut)</h3></center>
<dd>"House Republicans denied any impropriety when they approved federal budget reductions of $17 billion and outlined $190 billion more, slashing programs that largely benefit women, children, and the poor, to pay for that 'pouting sex kitten' mistress of their dreams -- tax cuts."
<p>
 -- U.S. News "reporter" Gerald Parshall giving the public "facts."
<p>
<center><h3>The Politics of Meaninglessness Award (for the Silliest Analysis)</h3></center>
"But aren't most medical procedures, when you describe them in detail, pretty disgusting? Isn't, for example, the production of veal, when you describe it in detail, and how people eat meat, when they crunch down on the flesh of living beings, formerly living beings, with their teeth. Isn't that pretty gruesome, too?"
<p>
-- PBS' <i>To the Contrary</i> host Bonnie Erbe, equating gruesome skull-crushing partial-birth abortions to...eating veal. <p>

<center><h3>The Dumbest Quote of the Year</h3></center>
"I think he ought to be worried about what's going on in the Good Lord's mind, because if there is retributive justice, he'll get AIDS from a transfusion, or one of his grandchildren will get it."
<p>
-- NPR's Nina Totenberg, reacting to Senator Jesse Helms' inquiry about AIDS getting more funding than cancer or heart disease.

<center><h2>New Horizons for the Entertainment Division</h2></center>
<dd><big>1</big>995 was a year of change for the MRC's 
Entertainment Division, changes which will greatly raise our profile and increase our influence in the American culture war. 
<dd>Our new mission was in large part inspired by prime time television's new agenda. In the late 1980s and early '90s, many shows were politically themed. Whether it was <i>L.A. Law</i> trashing Operation Desert Storm, <i>thirtysomething</i> promoting abortion, or <i>Designing Women</i> crusading for most every liberal cause under the sun, the small screen seemed at times to overflow with political advocacy. 
<dd>Of late, though, there has been much less explicit political content on entertainment television. 
That's the good news. 
<dd>Instead of politics, prime time is now emphasizing values, but -- here's the bad news -- Hollywood is now as hostile to traditional morality as it ever was to Ronald Reagan and Dan Quayle.
<dd>Tune in pretty much any time -- even during the so-called "family hour," between 8 and 9 p.m. -- and you'll see this for yourself. Popular series such as <i>Friends and Seinfeld</i> promote premarital sex. Obscenities are frequent on such shows as <i>NYPD Blue</i> and <i>Law & Order</i>. Parental authority is ridiculed on the likes of The Simpsons and Married...With Children. Worst of all, what was once the family hour (8-9 p.m. EST) is now reserved for many of the most offensive programs.
<dd>Yes, when it comes to what Hollywood is teaching our children, the battles are now over values, not politics. 
<dd>To put ourselves on the front lines, last year we established the Parents' Television Council, whose task is to promote responsible prime time programming by working directly with the entertainment industry.
<dd>Though the PTC is headquartered in southern California, its research ammunition will come from the MRC's main office near Washington. In order to focus more of our resources directly on the West Coast, we have decided to discontinue the publication of TV, etc., the Entertainment Division's monthly newsletter. 
<dd>Under the new plan, some of the Entertainment Division's research and analysis will be issued in monographs like the <i>Family Guide to Prime Time Television</i>; and some of it will emerge as MRC Special Reports, which will examine quantitatively the values promoted by prime time television. 
<dd>An example of the latter is our soon-to-be- released study of sexual content and vulgar language which has become a growing trend for the family hour. Yes, it seems that Hollywood is going out of its way once again to insult the traditional American family by airing material unsuited to children at an hour which in past years was set aside for family viewing. Our goal is to inform parents of these practices and through them to incite change in the entertainment industry.
<dd>We're confident that our revised approach will result in a product that will reach and enlighten an ever growing audience, particularly the parents most concerned about the poisonous values of the entertainment community. 
<br>

<center><h2>PTC's <i>Family Guide</i> Makes a Splash</h2></center>
<dd><big>T</big>he Parents' Television 
   Council (PTC) is a special project of the Media Research Center. The PTC's 1995-'96 <b><i>Family Guide to Prime Time Television</i></b>, the only publication written specifically to help parents determine appropriate television programming, has received national attention since its release in late November.
<dd>The Guide was unveiled at a Hollywood press conference featuring MRC chairman L. Brent Bozell III and actress <b>Shirley Jones</b>, Honorary Co-Chair of the PTC.
<dd>And, as if all that weren't enough, the Guide has at least one fan on Capitol Hill. Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.) was so impressed with the Guide that he plans to give a copy to each member of the House and has invited Brent Bozell to speak to Congress about the "influence of television on our culture" at a  "Members only" breakfast.
<dd>The PTC, Smith said, "provides Americans who want to see positive values instilled in children with an invaluable tool. The <i>Family Guide</i>...is the best summary of the values reflected in current prime time television programs that I've seen." 
<dd>Thousands of copies of the Guide now have been distributed, and its editor, Sandra L. Crawford, has conducted promotional interviews with such newspapers as the Detroit Free Press and The Washington Times as well as with such electronic outlets as the Newstalk TV cable network. 
<dd>The first television ad for the Guide aired in the Oklahoma City market.

<center><h2>FEMI Report Piques Media Interest</h2></center>
<dd><big>D</big>oes the profit motive determine what network executives put on prime time television, or is it their political ideology? 
<dd>Last summer, <b>MediaNomics</b>, the Free Enterprise & Media Institute's (a division of the MRC) newsletter, reported a strange phenomenon. 
<dd>The television networks, we reported, continue to produce prime time shows with extreme, anti-business environmental themes. It doesn't matter that such shows consistently get poor ratings. The anti-business, environmental extremism of television writers, producers, and executives forces the shows on the air.
<dd>The <i>MediaNomics</i> story caught the eye of <i>USA Today</i> magazine's editorial staff. They asked MediaNomics Editor Tim Lamer to expand the article into a story for an upcoming issue of the publication. In his report, Lamer shows how TV shows with environmental themes, such as the recently canceled seaQuest 2032 and the movie The Fire Next Time, garnered extremely poor ratings. Both took gratuitous slaps at business.
<dd>On the futuristic sci-fi show seaQuest, for example, ruthless businessman Larry Deon creates havoc for the world. He breaks off a chunk "the size of New England" from a polar icecap. He wants to flood the Middle East and create a market for his fresh water supply. (Does any of this sound the slightest bit plausible?)Viewers learn from Deon's opponent, Wolenczak, that "Lawrence Deon is a privateer, and his companies are turning the world's water supplies into sewage." Viewers also learn from another of Deon's opponents that "the man's been a grandstander since he sold IBM off in a yard sale when he was 23."
<dd>Deon also engages in piracy and tries to sabotage the Omni-Pacific, a transcontinental underwater railroad -- because it will compete with his airlines, don't you know? The government is afraid to try to stop Deon. One politician asks the crew of seaQuest: "So what are we sup-posed to do, embarrass him in front of the whole world? The last time we did that, he tripled the price of steel and nearly bankrupted the auto industry." 
<dd>America, meet the free enterprise system -- Hollywood style.
<dd>Lamer also points out that this business-bashing is not new to entertainment television. 
A 1992 FEMI study showed that business owners committed 43 percent of all crimes on television and 36 percent of all murders, far more than any other group, including politicians, lawyers -- even mobsters. All this from an industry that purports to "reflect reality."
<dd>FEMI, both through its newsletter and through respected national publications, continues to hold the networks accountable for their attacks on businessmen, society's innovators and job creators.

<center><h2><big>MRC</big> Board of Trustees Meeting</h2></center>
<dd>Each year the Media Research Center invites its Board of Trustees to Washington, D.C. to help chart  the future for the organization. It gives us a great opportunity to get input from some of the people who make our work possible through their donations. The Board met in Washington, D.C. on December 5 to formally review the MRC's work.
We think it's important to give MRC Members the same kind of information, so here are some highlights from the meeting:
<dd>MRC Chairman L. Brent Bozell III informed the Trustees of the exciting new plans for its divisions and special projects in 1996 -- the Entertainment Division's new focus on family values and the Free Enterprise and Media Institute's joint projects with other conservative organizations -- also the News Division's plans to confront the leftist media during the upcoming presidential campaign with our <I><b>Tell the Truth!</b></i>  Campaign.
<dd>Among the dignitaries and special guests, Representative J.C. Watts, Jr. (R-Okla) addressed the Trustees. He said of the media: "When it comes to liberals and their lapdog media -- they can lie louder. They are shameless." The Oklahoma Congressman continued, "I have been amazed at how people will go to the well of the House or Senate and spew forth lie after lie and scare our citizens with lies. I have watched in horror as Katie Couric has treated the Speaker of the House [Newt Gingrich] or the Majority Leader [Dick Armey] like criminals for wanting to do the right thing. They can lie louder, but we can tell the truth longer."
<dd>He continued by congratulating the MRC on the opening of the Parents' Television Council in Hollywood. Rep. Watts also reinforced the fact that family values in the entertainment industry are not only entertaining, they are very good business. 
<dd>Syndicated columnist and CNN talk show host Robert Novak also spoke at our Board of Trustees function. Pointing out the simple fact that the majority of journalists are liberal, Novak outlined eight statements that  most members of the press would support:
<ol>
<li>The Republican budget will slash spending for women, children, and the poor.
<li>The U.S. has a global role to protect human rights wherever possible.
<li>Missile defense is a waste of money.
<li>A major purpose of government is income redistribution.
<li>Affirmative action programs are absolutely essential.
<li>The federal government alone can do much better than the states.
<li>Term limits are a bad idea.
<li>America is undertaxed.
<dd>Novak  proceeded by explaining that it's easy to see why the media are biased when you have a majority of journalists who agree with these points.
<dd>Some other special guests who attended the meeting included General Alexander Haig; Ed Capano, Publisher of <i>National Review</i>; Oklahoma Senator James Inhofe; and Arianna Huffington, MRC Trustee and Senior Fellow at the Progress and Freedom Foundation.

<center><h2>Letter from the Chairman</h2></center>
Dear MRC Member,
<p>
<dd><big>I</big>t was early one evening and I was sitting with my young daughter, watching what I thought was a perfectly wholesome show on television. To my surprise and horror, the two main characters on this particular program began having an explicitly sexual conversation. 
<dd>Awkwardly I tried to draw my daughter's attention away from the lewd material coming from the television.
<dd>It's a scene repeated in homes all over America every night. The pollution on the airwaves -- even during the so-called "family hour" -- is out of control.
<dd>Like it or not, studies show that children admire and imitate their favorite celebrities more so than their parents, teachers, or religious leaders. 
<dd>And when surveys also show that by the time the average child graduates from high school he or she will have spent more time in front of a television than in the classroom, who is the teacher in society today?  
<dd>That is why the Media Research Center's Entertainment Division is taking giant steps to make television safe for children again.
<dd>For years Hollywood has been pushing the envelope on sexual themes and rough language. Now the networks have almost completely abandoned what was once the "family hour."  Shows still aimed at children contain some very adult-oriented -- and in some cases, highly offensive -- subject matter.
<dd>In February we released our study, <b><i>A Vanishing Haven: The Decline of the Family Hour</b></i>, and have made the networks' irresponsible programming the subject of a national discussion. 
<dd>We've launched a crusade which has gained support from both conservatives like Rep. Lamar Smith (R.-Tex.) and liberals like Senator Joe Lieberman (D.-Conn.) -- both of whom joined me at a national press conference to release this study on the "family" hour.
<dd>Last month I met with network executives in California. John Matoian (President of the Fox Entertainment Group) and had a very productive conversation about the state of prime time. The Senior Vice President of Programming for the Disney Channel, Bruce Rider, reaffirmed his network's strong commitment to family programming. Warner Brothers' Jamie Kellner told me that maintaining family-friendly programming standards was not only good for young viewers but very good for business -- and would be the cornerstone for this new network.
<dd>So there are good signs  that things are moving in our direction. But now is the time to work, and push, like never before. In these pages you'll get more information on our national campaign, all made possible because of your support.
Sincerely,
<p>

<center><h2>Family Hour Findings</h2></center>
<dd><big>P</big>rime time television's traditional family hour -- 8 to 9 p.m. Eastern and Pacific, 7-8 Central and Mountain -- traditionally has been home to scores of wholesome series, including <i>Little House on the Prairie, Happy Days, The Cosby Show</i>, and <i>Full House. </i>
<dd>Not anymore.
<dd>The "family hour" is now dominated by adult-oriented shows like <i>Friends</i> and <i>Mel-rose Place</i>, with sexual content and obscen-ities prevalent across the dial. To document how pervasive the problem has become, the Media Research Center's Entertainment Division studied a month's worth of "family hour" shows. On February 8 we released <i><b>A Vanishing Haven: The Decline of the Family Hour</b></i> and opened up a new front in the American cultural war.
<dd>Our study found that certain words and expressions that as recently as the early 1990s were rarely heard on TV -- even late at night -- are now common between 8 and 9. "Kiss my ass," "bastard," and "bitch," among other vulgarisms, are now acceptable in the "family hour."
<dd>Of the networks, NBC easily won the foul-language award. It aired more than twice as many obscenities per hour -- 1.26 -- as any other network. Fox, ABC, and CBS turned in virtually identical per-formances, with each averaging just over one curse word for every two hours of 8-9 programming. The series with the most swearing was NBC's Mad About You, with seven obscenities; the same network's <i>JAG</i> followed with six. 
<dd>Depictions of sexual behavior were just as squalid. The former "family hour" constantly portrays premarital sex as frequent and permissible; in fact, during the study period, depictions of extramarital or premarital sex outnumbered those of sex within marriage by an 8-1 ratio.
<dd>Fox led the network standings with the most sexual treatments per hour, but the other networks were close behind. NBC's <i>Friends</i>, Fox's <i>Melrose Place</i> and <i>Martin,</i> CBS's <i>Cybill</i> and <i>Almost Perfect</i>, and ABC's <i>Ellen</i> and <i>The Drew Carey Show</i> are just some examples of shows with typically raunchy portrayals of sex.
<dd>A Vanishing Haven has gained the support of from both the left and the right. Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.) joined Brent Bozell at the Washington, D.C. press conference where the MRC introduced the study. 
<dd>After summarizing the study findings for reporters, Bozell discussed a letter sent to the entertainment heads of the television networks calling on them to air only "wholesome, family-oriented programming" between 8 and 9. Signers of the letter were Bozell, Lieberman, and Smith, and six other Congressional leaders: Senators Dan Coats (R-Ind.), Lauch Faircloth (R-N.C.), and Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex.) and Representatives: Tom DeLay (R-Tex.), Steve Largent (R-Okla.), and J.C. Watts (R-Okla.)
<dd>"The bulk of TV programming has rapidly grown ruder, cruder, and lewder over the past few years," Sen. Lieberman remarked on the state of network programming standards. "I'm glad to join with the Media Research Center today to call upon the networks to reestablish the family hour...Like any other parent, I don't think it's too much to ask to have one hour [of TV] a night that's junk-free."
<dd>"Many TV shows aired during what should be [the] family hour are corrupting the morals and corroding the minds of a generation of Americans," Rep. Smith stated. "We hope TV producers will live up to their public trust and take their responsibility seriously."  
<dd>Not only did the study garner bipartisan support, it also attracted the attention of the national media. Even they can't disagree that television's programming standards have been heading steadily down- hill. 
<dd>The press conference generated massive coverage. Most networks covered the event; and stories appeared in <i>USA Today</i>, the <i>New York Post</i>, the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>, and the <i>Washington Times</i>. The study also was cited by numerous radio talk show hosts including, Rush Limbaugh and Paul Harvey. 
<dd>The debate is in high gear. Rupert Murdoch of Fox Television has now announced his network will institute a ratings system to monitor sexual content and violence on his shows. In the <i>Washington Post</i>, Bozell called this "a good first step," and added: "This is the man most responsible for pollution on the airwaves. Now he's saying he'll rate his pollution instead of doing what he should do. What he should do is get it off the air."

<dd><big>P</big>amela K. Long, the creator and executive producer of the new ABC family drama, <b><i>Second Noah</i></b>, recently met with Sandra L. Crawford, the Media Research Center's Entertainment Division Director, to discuss the series and ask for the MRC's support; and <i>Noah</i> deserves our.
<dd>Filmed at Busch Gardens Tampa Bay, <i>Second Noah</i> chronicles the hectic lives of Noah and Jesse Beckett. Noah (Daniel Hugh Kelly) is a former basketball coach and a best-selling novelist, while Jesse (Betsy Brantley) is the chief veterinarian at the Tampa Zoo. Mother and father to eight adopted children of various ethnic backgrounds, the Becketts also run an animal rescue operation, taking in abandoned or mistreated ani-mals. With love and compassion, Noah and Jesse face the daily challenges of raising eight children.
<dd><i>Second Noah</i> places great emphasis on personal responsibility and the family unit. The new series is filled with positive messages about honesty, understanding, and love. It respects religion and condemns racism. 
<dd><i>Second Noah</i> is a quality drama designed for family viewing. Since it has a rich and complex cast of characters to provide limitless possibilities for new stories, we hope <i>Second Noah</i> will be around to offer wholesome family entertainment for a long time to come.
<dd>The series airs on ABC, Monday nights at 8 p.m. EST.

<center><h2>CBS's Goldberg: Media are biased </h2></center>
<dd><big>V</big>indication is sweet. For years the Media Research Center has been documenting the liberal bias of the media, often provoking hostile denials by journalists. But now someone has joined our efforts -- and the support comes from a most welcomed quarter.
<dd>In a stunning <i>Wall Street Journal</i> column, CBS News correspondent Bernard Goldberg wrote that "the old argument that the networks and other 'media elites' have a liberal bias is so blatantly true that it's hardly worth discussing anymore." 
<dd>What prompted Goldberg to write the February 13 article was a <i>CBS Evening News</i> segment about the flat tax by Goldberg's colleague Eric Engberg. Engberg used such loaded words as "elixir" and "scheme" to describe the flat tax, "conjuring up images of Doctor Feelgood selling worthless junk out of the back of his wagon," according to Goldberg.
<dd>Goldberg recounted how Engberg spent much of the story saying a flat tax would cause "hideous deficits" without mentioning the role of spending in recent deficit growth. Goldberg also pointed out how Engberg used only a liberal economist for his story, and didn't even label him as liberal, a privilege never granted to conservatives. Goldberg also revealed the networks' dirty little secret: "Part of the problem is that most reporters and editors -- television and print... don't know a capital gain from a mutual fund. This, as much as bias, in some cases leads to the kind of reporting we see on the flat tax and a lot of other economic issues."
<dd>With his temper, Engberg himself probably required several buckets of ice to cool down before pronouncing to the press: "I've never regarded myself as an ideological warrior of any kind."
<dd>And Dan Rather supported Engberg by declaring: "His hallmarks have always been fairness and accuracy."
<dd>Really? See for yourself if these Engberg reports strike you as "hallmarks of fairness and accuracy":
<dd>October 2, 1994, on Newt Gingrich: "From the start, modesty was not his style. Rejecting the House's gentlemanly ways, he waged such constant guerrilla war against the Democrats he was attacked for McCarthyism...the family values candidate who divorced his ailing first wife, the avowed enemy of dirty politics who bounced 22 checks at the House Bank and runs a big-dollar political action committee that won't disclose its contributors." He also called Gingrich "bombastic and ruthless."
<dd>August 28, 1993 <i>Face the Nation</i> question to conservative Rep. Gary Franks: "I know that many of the ideas that you advocate, self-help, up-by-the-bootstraps-type arguments, that has been used for years as an excuse for the government to do nothing, hasn't it?"  
<dd>October 5, 1992: "Feel-bad ads trying to drag down Bill Clinton are regarded as the only hope. In a multi-million dollar assault, Clinton is being portrayed as a duplicitous blobhead who governs a Hee Haw backwater where only the taxes soar. The ads are cleverly worded to suggest Clinton means more taxes." 
<dd>After exposing the Bush ad for relying on "assumptions" that Clinton would raise taxes, Engberg then asked Steven Colford of <i>Advertising Age</i> to describe "the stacking up of assumptions like this, there's a word we use for that." Replied Colford: "I think it's 'lying.'"
<dd>June 7, 1989, on China's Tiananmen Square massacre: "Will the military leaders there be embarrassed by this? Will this be something like Kent State was for our military?"
<dd>April 6, 1989: Engberg charged that in 1985, George Bush "carried promises of U.S. aid to the military dictatorship of Honduras." (Not true: CBS showed video of Bush hugging <i>democratically elected</i> civilian leader Roberto Suazo Cordova.)
<dd>Goldberg's friends told the <i>Washington Post</i>. "He has complained to CBS management about a liberal tilt for several years and has been consistently ignored." 
<dd>Is CBS's reaction to his published charges -- denial and arrogance -- any surprise?

<center><h2>Foreign journalists learn about MRC</h2></center>
<dd><big>I</big>s media bias just a problem in America? It may surprise you to learn that the Media Research Center's mission to encourage responsible journalism doesn't stop at the country's borders. The National Forum Foundation and Delphi International have made the MRC a popular stop for international journalists. The two groups, which arrange tours of the United States for foreign professionals, now regularly bring their guests to the MRC headquarters to learn more about what we do and the unique role we play in American politics.
<dd>Just in the past few months, reporters and journalism professors from Algeria, Austria, Gabon, Kyrgystan, Nepal, Pakistan, Poland, and Russia have visited the MRC. Tim Lamer, Director  of the MRC's Free Enterprise & Media Institute, briefs them on the biases of the American media, what the MRC does to combat those biases, and the crucial role of strong watchdog organizations in a democratic society.
<dd>The questions they ask are wide-ranging and fascinating because they reflect the authoritarian backgrounds of their countries. "Does the MRC advocate censorship?" (No, we assure them, but we believe a free press does not mean freedom from criticism.) "Is the MRC funded by the government?" (No, we're funded by like-minded Americans who recognize the need for a check on the media's power, and who want the media held accountable for what they say and write.) In fact, we inform them, the press cannot truly be free unless both it and its critics are not entangled by government regulations and financing.
<dd>Some have expressed interest in someday starting an organization like the MRC in their own countries. Some have remained, working out of our office in order to learn the trade. Many of them find they can use our research for their work back home. All of them come away with a better understanding of the American media and the American political scene.
<dd>By supporting the MRC, you aren't just making the American media more responsible, you're being a positive influence on the global media.

<center><h2>FEMI editor and the welfare debate</center></h2>
<dd><big>W</big>hile combating liberal media bias is the main mission of the Media Research Center, our staffers sometimes take on other issues as well. Example: Tim Lamer of the MRC's Free Enterprise & Media Institute recently wrote an article about welfare reform for <i><b>The Weekly Standard</b></i>, one of the conservative movement's premier magazines.
<dd>At issue was an amendment to the welfare reform bill offered by Republican Senator John Ashcroft of Missouri. The amendment would have allowed government to contract with religious charities to provide welfare services to the poor, as long as they didn't use the money to proselytize. Lamer argued that the amendment was a mistake on three grounds.
<dd>First, the reason religious charities do well is because they proselytize. If they're not allowed to do that, they won't be any more effective than government or other charities. Second, taxpayers of all religious stripes  -- whether Roman Catholic, Evangelical Protestant, Jewish, Mormon, or whatever -- shouldn't be forced by the government into supporting faiths with which they disagree. Third, conservatives shouldn't be turning more charities into clients of the welfare state unless we want even more groups lobbying for big government.
<dd>Lamer's article ran in the January 15 issue of <b><i>The Weekly Standard</i></b>.

<center><h2>Commentary</h2>
<h3>L. BRENT BOZELL III</h3>
<h3>Franken Privileges: Cheap-Shot Satire</h3></center>
<dd><big>F</big>ew doubt that Al Franken's a genuinely funny guy. He wrote for <i>Saturday Night Live</i> during its golden age in the latter half of the 1970s; years later on SNL, he created and realized the character of wispy self-help sage Stuart Smalley and performed a hilarious impression of Sen. Paul Simon. 
<dd>Alas, national recognition for his ability to amuse apparently wasn't en-ough for Franken, who now styles himself a pundit as well. He says his sporadically laugh - provoking bestseller Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations (Delacorte) is a "satire about the breakdown in the civility of public discourse," but on the frequent occasions when his ideology crowds out his wit, he's unquestionably uncivil in his own right.
<dd>Is Franken a humorist seeking to score laughs or a polemicist out to slay the dragons of the right? To be sure, much of what he writes is clearly satirical. Of an exhibit at the never-built Disney's America theme park that was to have simulated what it was like to be a slave, he quips, "All I can say is that it [would have been] a gross distortion of history to have the Un-derground Railroad loop the loop." Not quite Jonathan Swift, but pretty clever. His political humor can carry a punch. But can conservatives take offense at a chapter titled "Pat Buchanan: Nazi Lover" when we've laughed uproariously at Limbaugh's "feminazi" digs? Not really, not if the intent is satire.
<dd>But that's where Franken fails. There's a certain venom in his pen that transforms humor into spite, and spite undisciplined becomes insult. Limbaugh thus becomes "mean," a "bully," and a "liar"; Limbaugh's fans are trashed as "yahoos" and "f---ing morons"; Buchanan's a "racist"; and anyone who thinks Ronald Reagan was the greatest President of this century is a "f---ing idiot." Casting aspersions on these and other con-servative personalities and causes, Franken's acting as a hatchet man -- no more, no less. 
<dd>Franken asserts that his harshness is ironic, that he's "making fun of meanness...by being mean myself." The problem with that argument is that amidst all the invective in his book, there's virtually no indication that he does not really despise his targets, or at least their politics. As far as keeping up with whether or not Franken is kidding at any given moment is concerned, Rush Limbaugh... is basically a 271-page shell game. 
<dd>Naturally, Franken's choice for the best President of the century is...Bill Clinton. "I was trying to write a scathing piece on Clinton," he declares, "and at a certain point it just became impossible...This kind of thing never happened when I was writing the Phil Gramm chapter." Gramm, on the other hand, is a "bastard" and a "big jerk." (But how dependable is Franken's opinion anyway? He's still trying to sell the long-debunked story that Gramm invested in a porn flick.)
<dd>Franken pulls out all the stops in a chapter concerned with 1) skewering Reaganomics and 2) blasting Limbaugh for his defense of same. Regarding said defense, Franken sneers, "These are the rational, carefully constructed, deliberate lies of a man running a gi-ant propaganda factory dedicated to two things: convincing people who were screwed sideways by Reagan-omics that it was actually good for them, and encouraging the people who turned the screws to feel good about themselves...Reaganomics worked. This is the jewel in Rush's crown of bulls--t."
<dd>If there is an economically sophis-ticated anti-Reaganomics case to be made, Franken doesn't make it, re-sorting instead to Richard Gephardt-like class-envy hackwork. As for most Americans getting "screwed side-ways," Franken apparently forgets that real income taxes paid by 90 percent of Americans fell by 10 percent from 1981 to 1987, while real income taxes paid by the richest five percent rose by nearly 43 percent in the same period. Add to that the obvious (seven years of prosperity; two decisive elec-tion victories for Presidential can-didates running on a Reaganomics-centered platform) and you realize why liberals in the entertainment community behave the way they do: Like Oliver Stone and his movies, Franken cannot defend the principles of liberalism -- so he enters the world of make-believe instead. Creative license, we're told.
<dd>Towards the end of that ill-fated chapter, Franken writes, "I think I'm really breaking new ground here. I mean, did you see bar graphs in Jerry Seinfeld's book? In Tim Allen's?" No, and the reason you didn't, obviously, is that Seinfeld and Allen had way too much comedic acumen to even dream of putting in bar graphs in the first place. There's some amusement to be found in Rush Limbaugh... but considered as political analysis, it is       -- in the derisive, non-funny sense -- a joke.

<center><h2>Letter from the Chairman</h2></center>
Dear MRC member,
<p>
<dd>I predicted that the media would have a field day with the GOP primaries, and that's just what happened. I don't know if there's ever been more negative or slanderous coverage of candidates  than what Bob Dole, Pat Buchanan, Steve Forbes and others have been subjected to this year. 
<dd>The media are complaining about how dirty campaigns have become, yet mud-slinging is the only issue they'll cover.  With all their attacks on GOP candidates, the media themselves are ignoring the real issues. 
<dd>A recent study, released by the Center for Media and Public Affairs, found that in campaign coverage "the networks devoted twice as many stories to the horse race (60) as the candidates' policies (30)." And let's not forget how negative the media themselves are. The same study showed reporters' "criticism of the race outnumbered praise by a 20-to-1 margin."
<dd>One blatant example of this was CBS's Eric Engberg's description of Steve Forbes' flat tax proposal as "wacky."  Even more flagrant was Ted Koppel's charge on Nightline that Buchanan is anti-Semitic.
<p>
<blockquote>
<b><font size=+1>Bozell: "If the media distortions continue to go unchecked, we'll be looking at four more years of Clinton running our country." </font></b>
</blockquote>
<p>
<dd>While the media complain about negative campaigns, they are giving less and less time to candidates who are trying to explain their policies. The same study found that the average length of candidates' soundbites was only 7.3 seconds -- shorter than ever. The study also compared the amount of airtime given to GOP candidates (56 minutes) to airtime reporters spent analyzing what the candidates were saying (5 hours, 45 minutes).
<dd>If the media distortions continue to go unchecked, we'll be looking at four more years of Clinton running our country, because they are doing nothing to expose his record.
We <b><i>must</i></b> make the media accountable for their gaps in the truth and distortions of the facts. That is why the Media Research Center has launched a two million dollar campaign to <b>hold the media responsible for their liberally slanted reporting, and force them to begin to "Tell the Truth."</b> Thank you for helping us. 
<p>
Sincerely,
<p>

<center><h2>MRC Welcomes new PTC Director Harry Medved</h2></center>
<dd><big>T</big>he Media Research Center is proud to announce that Harry Medved, the former National Communications Director of the Screen Actors Guild, has assumed his post as the Executive Director of the Parents' Television Council.
<dd>The Los Angeles based Parents' Television Council is a special project of the MRC. The PTC's goal to restore traditional family values to the entertainment industry.
<dd>"It is a privilege to have Harry Medved join the Parents' Television Council as the Executive Director." said MRC Chairman Brent Bozell in a national statement. "He brings a wealth of experience to the PTC.  Harry knows the industry and its people, and he will be a valuable leader in the efforts to restore family-friendly programming."
<dd>Medved's experience in the entertainment industry is indeed extensive. He is the co-founder of the multimedia company Hollywood Interactive, Inc., as well as the co-author of four books on motion picture history.  During his work for the Screen Actors Guild, he was responsible for overseeing all media relations. He has also co-authored four satirical books on the movie industry with his brother, the well known film critic Michael Medved.
<dd>Harry Medved's broad background provides him with the media savvy necessary to insure that the PTC will have an even greater impact on the debate over values in Hollywood. 
<dd>"I consider this a terrific opportunity to improve communications within the industry on these important issues," Medved remarked. "I look forward to working closely with network executives, producers, writers, directors and actors on this project to build bridges with families across the country."
<dd>Here at the MRC, we are confident that our fight for family values is taking a great leap forward with Medved taking the reins of the PTC.  He will be a valuable asset in our struggle to promote responsible programming, making television  safe for America's children.

<center><h2>FEMI Breakfast Forum A Huge Success</h2></center>
<dd>During his run for the Republican presidential nomination, Steve Forbes called for the overhaul of our hopelessly confusing tax system while replacing it with a flat tax. 
<dd>Reporters continuously savaged the flat tax, ignoring arguments supporting tax reform. Journalists called it "wacky" and "a cruel hoax." They said it would cause "hideous deficits." They labeled it an "economic elixir." They suggested it would add $140 billion to the deficit. They called it a tax increase on the poor, a tax increase on the middle class, and nothing but a tax cut for the rich.
<dd>According to many economists, it's none of those things. But you virtually never hear this side of the story in the news media.
<dd>That made the flat tax a perfect topic for a Free Enterprise & Media Institute Breakfast Forum. FEMI (a division of the Media Research Center) Breakfast Forums are held with the intention of bringing together conservative policy makers and journalists to discuss important economic issues, to acquaint journalists with conservative sources (whom they rarely quote) and their ideas.
<dd>The flat tax forum was held March 13 in Washington and included then-Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes and former Congressman Jack Kemp. In his introduction of Mr. Forbes, MRC Chairman Brent Bozell emphasized that the event was not an endorsement of the Forbes candidacy. 
<dd>Mr. Forbes then proceeded to give a comprehensive overview on the history of taxation in America, then followed it with a thorough explanation of his flat tax proposal. Forbes explained how his plan would not increase taxes on anyone, and how it would cut taxes for everyone. He stressed that the only way to reduce the deficit  is to reduce spending, or have the economy grow, both of which a flat tax would accomplish. Forbes argued that because the flat tax would lower interest rates, it would help homeowners. As for complaints from charitable organizations, he showed how, throughout history, tax cuts have always generated increases in charitable giving by making people richer.
<dd>These were arguments that many reporters, trained on the short soundbite, had never heard. Forbes expressed his gratitude to the MRC for giving him this opportunity to go "beyond 30-second, or ten-second, or three-second soundbites, not trying to play gotcha, but trying to gain true understanding. As we say in <i>Forbes</i> magazine, out of Deuteronomy in the Bible, 'With all thy getting, get understanding.' I appreciate, Brent, this opportunity to help that process."
<dd>The FEMI Breakfast Forum was a huge press event. It drew all three broadcast networks, CNN, and C-SPAN. It also drew major print reporters, such as Michael Barone of <i>U.S. News & World Report</i>, Gerald Seib of the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, and Dan Balz of the <i>Washington Post</i>. 
The forum also garnered stories in the <i>Washington Post, Chicago Tribune</i>, and <i>USA Today</i>, and on CNN's <i>Inside Politics</i>, among many others. The entire FEMI Breakfast Forum was shown on C-SPAN.

<center><h2>MRC Co-Sponsors  CPAC</h2></center>
<dd><big>T</big>he Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), an annual convention held in Washington, D.C., brings together dozens of conservative leaders with thousands of grassroots activists. This year the Media Research Center co-sponsored the 23rd Annual Conservative Political Action Conference. 
<dd>CPAC is host to such groups as the Family Research Council, the Christian Coalition, the Heritage Foundation, and the National Rifle Association.
<dd>It is also a forum for thousands of conservatives from all regions to hear the conservative perspective on the key issues of the day. Noted speakers this year included Bill Bennett, Oliver North, Senator Phil Gramm (R.-Tex.), Congressman Bob Dornan (R.-Calif.),  Steve Forbes, and Alan Keyes.
<dd>The Media Research Center played a major role at CPAC this year. MRC spokesmen met with our members and subscribers at the MRC's CPAC booth where we distributed  a wealth of information. 
<dd>The MRC also hosted an open reception for the CPAC attendees, where our supporters were able to talk with Brent Bozell and other key MRC staff. Bozell also moderated the annual debate between CNN's conservative Bob Novak and ABC's liberal Sam Donaldson. Always one of the highlights of the conference, this debate drew a capacity crowd. 
<dd>It was clear, from so many speakers' presentations as well as the mood of the CPAC attendees, that conservatives are fed up with the pervasive influence of the liberal media and their coverage of politics. 
<dd>It was equally emphatic that the movement sees the MRC as the leader in the fight to expose and neutralize this bias.

<center><h2><i>Time</i> Writer Damns Those Conservatives</h2></center>
<dd><i><blockquote>"I can't tell you how thrilled I am to have been named twice in your December 18 edition featuring the Best Notable Quotables of 1995. To be attacked by a mob of lunatics like your panel of judges is truly an honor. I will cherish it nearly as much as I do the condemnation I received from Louis Farrakhan's followers for criticizing the Million Man March and his recent tour of third world dictatorships. Please select me again!"</i></blockquote>
This is a letter to the Media Research Center from <i>Time</i> magazine's Jack E. White. 
White won the "Damn Those Conservatives Award" in our <i><b>Best Notable Quotables of 1995</b></i> for this quote from his June column:
<dd> "These days Washington seems to be filled with white men who make black people uneasy, like Newt the slasher, Bill the waffler, and Jesse the crank -- Helms that is, not Jackson. But the scariest of all the hobgoblins may well be a fellow African American, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. In the four years since George Bush chose him to fill the 'black seat' left by Thurgood Marshall, Thomas has emerged as the high court's most aggressive advocate of rolling back the gains Marshall fought so hard for. The maddening irony is that Thomas owes his seat to precisely the kind of racial preference he goes to such lengths to excoriate."
<dd>White also made runner-up for the "Embodiment of all Evil Award (for Newt Bashing)" in the <b><i>Best Notable Quotables of 1995</i></b> for this quote:
<dd>"Let's face it: to most African Americans Newt Gingrich is one scary white man...One can only hope Gingrich was sincere in his speech to Congress last week...That could only mean Gingrich is serious about shedding his party's whites-only image. If so, blacks ought to meet him halfway -- if only to temper the impulses of one scary white man."
<dd>Who makes up this "mob of lunatics"? This year the judges for the <b><i>Best Notable Quotables</i></b> included such broadly respected and well known conservatives as CNN's Bob Novak, CNBC's Cal Thomas, and <i>American Spectator</i> Editor R. Emmett Tyrrell; in years past they have been joined by Rush Limbaugh and Charlton Heston.
<dd>Is it any wonder why the public is fed up with the arrogance of the national press?

<h3>Negative Campaigning: Look Who's Talking   The Washington Times</h3></center>
<p>
<dd><big>T</big>he pundits are right.This is the worst year of negative campaigning I've ever seen. These Republican can-didates are being torn apart at the seams. Just sample some of the invective that's being thrown at them on television:
<ol>
<li> Before the campaign really got going, Phil Gramm's campaign was being smeared with a negative TV ad featuring on the screen a New Republic headline labeling Gramm "The Porn Broker" for 18 seconds. When the New Republic's source for the allegation that Gramm had funded a "soft-porn" film in the 1970s repudiated the story, saying "there was no pornography at all," there were no apologies.
<li> Steve Forbes saw his flat tax plan attacked in one campaign commercial as likely to produce "hideous deficits." The ad concluded: "The fact remains the flat tax is a giant, untested theory. One economist suggested before we put it in, we should test it out someplace        -- like Albania." 
<li> The most vicious negative attacks have been aired against Pat Buchanan. One underlined his endorsement by Russian nationalist kook Vladimir Zhirinovsky. 
</ol>
<dd>Another one charged: "It's not that Pat Buchanan today is associated with overtly anti-Semitic or racist acts or statements, but rather that he has  created an image of someone who might be sympathetic to such acts or statements by others." 
<dd>Yet another stooped to attacks on his family, charging his father listened to the anti-Semitic radio show of Father Coughlin, and that his little brothers beat up Jewish kids -- "Christ-killers," they were allegedly called -- in the 1950s.
<p>
<blockquote><b><font size=+1>If they still wish to be the black pot lecturing the kettles on negative campaigning, I have four words for them: Sit down. Shut up.</font></b></blockquote>
<p>
<dd>Yet another ad against Buchanan showed racist nut David Duke at a Buchanan rally, and featured an endorsement from Ku Klux Klansman Daniel Carver. The ad concluded: "A man who says what he means and means what he says and now must fight the embrace of people who think they know exactly what he's talking about."
<dd>As you may already have concluded, these aren't really commercials made by the Republican presidential candidates. Anyone who watches politics knows that were candidates to say these things in their commercials they would be universally scorned -- especially by the press -- for doing so. They are, instead, what the networks themselves have offered us in this campaign. ABC smeared Phil Gramm. CBS bombed the Forbes flat tax. ABC's Ted Koppel and CBS's Bob McNamara hurled bigoted attacks at Buchanan. If we would hound candidates off the hustings for these kinds of attacks, why do we tolerate them from reporters?
<dd>These are the same networks who shake their heads and decry the corrosive negativity of politics. After the recent South Carolina debate, in which the candidates were required to respond to each other's negative ads, the networks all clucked at how unappetizing the prospect was. One wonders if they have considered how unappetizing watching their own programs can be. If they still wish to be the black pot lecturing the kettles on negative campaigning throughout this election year, I have four words for them: Sit down. Shut up. 
<dd>Koppel, for his part, couldn't even leave his attacks at the low level of questioning the ancient antics of the Buchanan children. (This, from  the  man who said of Bill Clinton's draft-dodging thank-you letter: "If we were electing that 23-year-old man, what he said and thought and felt at that time would be germane.") Koppel had help from Time essayist Lance Morrow, who in his magazine likened Buchanan to Joe McCarthy -- "the driving, urgent undershadow of menace." 
<dd>For <i>Nightline</i>, Morrow added that Buchanan's upbringing at the Blessed Sacrament Church and Gonzaga High School was marked by a "reflexive" anti-Semitism of the "they killed Christ" variety. But others who attended high school with Buchanan flatly deny this outrageous charge. You guessed it: <i>Nightline</i> ignored them. 
<dd>Liberal <i>Boston Globe</i> columnist Tom Oliphant has called the liberal media to account on these charges of bigotry against Buchanan, often employing guilt by association: "For liberals to be silent simply because this filth is being directed at a creature of the Right who happens to be on a political roll is intolerable." 
<dd>Already, the media are preparing this story line for the 1996 general election campaign. Bill Clinton, the Great Triangulator, is trying to give the country a better tomorrow, while the Republicans, devoid of vision, have nothing to offer but cheap negative attacks.  
<dd>It's important to declare that negativity has a place in any campaign in defining why one candidate deserves to be elected over his opponent. But let the candidates do that. Decency is also important. It's time the national media attempt to rise to the level of civility these Republican candidates have shown each other.

<center><h2>Letter from the Chairman</h2></center>
<b>Dear MRC Member,</b>
<p>
<dd><big>W</big>elcome to <i>Flash</i>, the new monthly newsletter pub-lished exclusively for Media Research Center Members.
<dd>Why a membership newsletter? Actually, the idea is rather simple -- and overdue. Recently we conducted a survey of our supporters to see how well we were keeping you informed about our work at the Media Research Center. 
<dd>The results told me we needed to do a better job.  Members supporting our Entertainment Division efforts weren't aware of the work of the News Division. Subscribers to our newsletters didn't know we had recently opened an office in Hollywood, the Parents' Television Council. PTC supporters aren't following the work of our Free Enterprise and Media Institute. And so on. 
<dd>The survey pointed to the need for a publication for MRC members only. Hence, <i>Flash</i>.
<dd>Each month <i>Flash</i> will serve as your connector to the MRC and its special projects, giving you the timely information on the many projects you are sup-porting through your membership.  Our newsletters. Books. Media appearances. Special reports. Studies. Press releases. Our nationally syndicated column. And much, much  more. 
<dd>Through your newsletter you will also be apprised of  Members' discounts on our merchandise and publications.
<dd>We want you to be abreast of what's going on here and how your gifts make it possible for us to expose and challenge the liberal media.
<dd>As a supporter of the MRC, you understand that the national news media have used their power to promote their left wing views. 
And thanks to you, now the public is on to them, too!
<dd>The Times Mirror Corporation took a survey which shows that 43 percent of the public today believes the national news media set the national agenda. You and I have known that for years. Now, through our efforts, the public is catching on!
<dd>There is another critical front, the cultural wars raging in the entertainment industry. The MRC, through its Parents' Tele-vision Council arm, is leading the fight for pro-family values in entertainment fare. The PTC's mission is to bring responsible, family oriented programming to television, and to organize and mobilize Hollywood conservatives as national spokesmen for our cause.
<dd>The Media Research Center is the largest, most active organization in America identifying, exposing and confronting the liberal agenda of the news and entertainment industries. You make that possible with your support.
<dd> In these pages you'll see why <i>Time</i> (grudgingly) admitted that, "for quality, resources and sheer volume of output, the new star on the right is the Media Research Center."
<dd>We hope you enjoy Flash. And we welcome any questions, comments or suggestions you may have. Please contact us at 1-800-MRC-1423. Or drop me a line. It's always good to hear from you.
<p> 
Sincerely,
<p>

<center><h2>Networks Gnawing at Newt</h2></center>
<dd><big>T</big>he national news media continue to ignore political scandals involving the Clinton administration, but wouldn't dare miss an opportunity to report any allegations, no matter how far fetched, against Republicans. MRC's news media analysts regularly follow this trend and expose the reporting of political scandals.
<dd>The results are predictable: biased reporting, chock-full of half-truths and outright distortions.
<dd>Take Newt Gingrich's book deal, for example.
<dd>The media have decided to link bulk sales of Gingrich's book, <i>To Renew America</i>, with violations by former Speaker Jim Wright with his book, <i>Reflections of a Public Man</i>. CNN <i>Prime News</i> anchor Linden Soles introduced a Bob Franken story: "This could be a case of what goes around come around," referring to Gingrich's expose of Wright's bulk book sales violation, which led to his resignation. 
<dd>An article in <i>Newsweek</i> went so far as to claim, "Former Speaker Jim Wright dismissed a pudgy, loudmouthed back-bencher named Newt Gingrich right up to the day in 1989 when Gingrich's guerrilla campaign forced Wright's resignation from the House. Now it appears that Gingrich has made exactly the same mistake".
<p>
<font size=+1><i><center>What the media know, but didn't tell you, is that <br>the two deals have nothing in common.</center></i></font>
<p>
<dd>What the media know, but didn't tell you, is that the two deals have nothing in common.
<dd>Wright's book deal gave him an outrageously high royalty of 55 percent -- from a publisher who happened to be a former employee.  Gingrich only earned the standard 15 percent from a real publisher. Wright's book was never even sold in bookstores, it was of-fered almost exclusively in bulk sales to lobbyists -- enabling him to get around House limits on honoraria income. 
<dd>Gingrich's book was a genuine commercial property, lasting 12-weeks on the best-seller list (selling close to a half-million books). In addition, the Gingrich book had a grand total of five bulk orders,  totaling just over 500 books.
<dd>Wright was charged with 69 counts of ethics violations -- and resigned in disgrace before being indicted.
<dd>Or take the case of another Democrat, former Speaker Tom Foley.  In 1993 the <i>Boston Globe</i> reported the SEC fined an investment firm $100,000 for giving friends preferential treatment with new stock offerings -- one friend being the former Speaker -- and the networks didn't even blink. Small investors like Foley are generally not privy to initial public offerings (IPOs).
<dd>With this information, Foley was reported to have reaped profits on eleven out of twelve initial public IPOs offered to him the previous year. And yet only one network (CNN's <i>Inside Politics</i>) covered the story! The rest completely ignored Foley's investments.
<dd>Our news analysts uncover these facts, then distribute them to millions of people around the country on a regular basis. Research like this is made possible thanks to your support.

<center><h2>FEMI Calls Journalists On The Carpet</h2></center>
<h3>Here's a Pop Quiz:</h3>

<dd><big>R</big>epublicans in Congress propose to balance the budget while increasing spending by 50 percent over 7 years.
<dd>President Clinton calls this a massive cut and shuts down the government for about a week in protest.
<dd>Guess which side the media took.
<dd>It wasn't difficult to predict that they would parrot Mr. Clinton's point of view. That's what they usually do. But something needed to be done about it, or else the American people wouldn't hear the truth.
<dd>That's where the MRC's Free Enterprise and Media Institute steps in. After analyzing the biased coverage of the first few days of the shutdown, FEMI issued a rapid-response study rebutting the media's liberal spin. 
<dd>In the middle of the shutdown, the study of the first few days' coverage was faxed to hundreds of journalists, press secretaries on Capitol Hill, and prominent conservatives.
<dd>The study found that journalists were refusing to report that spending under the GOP plan was actually increasing; and that reporters were only interviewing people upset about the shutdown while ignoring the nearly half of all Americans who thought it wasn't a problem.
<dd>Lo and behold, coverage started to change! The night after we faxed out the study, NBC News produced a report showing how most people outside the beltway weren't put off by the shutdown.  
<dd>An on December 12, ABC's <i>Nightline</i> exposed Mr. Clinton for lying about GOP "cuts." They actually showed, with a graph on screen, how Republicans were planning on increasing federal spending.
<dd>Keeping the media on their toes is our mission! But we need your help in order to continue this fight.

<center><h2><i>Family Guide</i> Gives Parents the Facts</h2></center>

<dd><big>P</big>arents are fed up with the values their children are learning from network television. This year it's worse than ever.  The four major networks appear to be engaged in a fierce competition for the dubious honor of seeing just how many obscenities, lewd remarks, and sexual situations they can pack into a nighttime television program.
<dd>And the family hour -- the  8 p.m.. time slot dedicated for children's programming -- is now the time slot for some of the worst programming of them all.
<dd>As much as parents may want to do it, there's no way anyone can monitor everything on network television today. This year there are over 90 different programs on network prime time television alone. That's all changed now.
<dd>Through our West Coast office, the Parents' Television Council, we have released the <b><i>1995-`96 Family Guide to Prime Time Television</i></b>, the first ever comprehensive review of the values presented on every single network evening program.
<dd>MRC analysts reviewed thousands of hours of program footage to compile the <i>Family Guide</i>. They looked at all NBC, ABC, CBS, and Fox shows as well as the newest offerings from the WB and UPN networks.
<dd>Rather than look at the artistic merits of a show, the guide analyzes it from the standpoint of values. Which shows are offensive for children? Which shows are highly recommended?
<dd>The Guide is presented in an easy to read format.  Every show on network television is presented with a brief "background" section about its themes, and that's followed with a "summary" outlining what is offensive, or what is recommended.
<dd>The guide is presented with a stoplight format. Red lights are given to those programs not recommended for youngsters; yellow lights for those that contain questionable material; and green lights for those that are recommended for children.
<dd>In November, MRC Chairman L. Brent Bozell III and Parents' Television Council Co-Chair-man Shirley Jones held a press conference in Hollywood to officially release the <i>Family Guide</i>. As Ms. Jones put it, "The <i>Family Guide to Prime Time Television</i> [is] a new and vital weapon in the fight for [children's] minds. That it has not been available until now is only testament to our parental impotency, that as of this day and this announcement is no longer acceptable."
<dd>Many others have praised the <i>Family Guide</i> including William Bennett, who described it as "an excellent resource: objective, accurate, easy to use...the Media Research Center has been doing good work for a long time. [The <i>Family Guide</i>] will surely reinforce its reputation."
<dd>We hope to distribute tens of thousands around the country this year. To help pay for this very expensive project, we are offering the <i>Family Guide</i> at a special rate for our members. With this guide in hand you won't have to worry anymore about the poison on prime time television affecting the children.

<center><h2>Festering Foster</h2></center>
<dd><bing>S</big>everal new developments renewed questions about White House actions related to the Travel Office firings and the death of Vince Foster.  But you wouldn't know if from watching network news.  On October 24 the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee released a May 14, 1993 memo from then-White House aide David Watkins in which he said the First Lady told him to replace career Travel Office employees with a private firm partially owned by a friend.  That contradicted statements made by White House officials over the past two years.  The next day, three handwriting experts asserted that Vince Foster's suicide note was a forgery, thereby implicating White House employees in a grand deception.
<dd>With the exception of a brief mention on NBC's <i>Today</i> on October 29 the networks were silent.  <i>Today</i> co-host Jack Ford asked Tim Russert about "new questions raised about the death of Vince Foster" which "curiously didn't get much coverage at all, the idea now that some experts are questioning the legitimacy of that suicide note."

<p>
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b> Welcome to Meet the Media, the fantasy world of objective journalism, where some of the most important media leaders in the land convene to give you the unfettered truth, the expert analysis concerning the important issues of the day. Today we look at the budget crisis. Let me start with you, E.J. If Bill Clinton were to sign the GOP bill, what would happen?</FONT>
<p><b>E.J. Dionne (<i>Washington Post</i>):</b> "I think that with those kinds of cuts in Medicaid, you really could do a lot of damage or at least cause problems for middle class people."
<p><b>Alan Murray (<i>Wall Street Journal</i>):</b> "If enacted it  would largely get the federal government out of the business of helping the poor. It would mean a much smaller government. It would probably mean a balanced budget. But I think the critics are also right that in some important ways it would mean a less humane government."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b> "Wait a moment, Alan, you sound like Dick Gephardt here. The Republican bill includes a spending increase of $2.6 trillion over the next seven years. That's hardly a much smaller government."</FONT>
<p><b>Robert MacNeil (PBS):</b> "Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle said the Democratic plan would cut $89 billion over seven years, a third of what the Republicans have proposed to slash."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b> "But that's my point. Politicians like Daschle and Clinton talk about $271 billion in cuts for Medicare but actually, under the GOP plan, spending in 2002 will be $86 billion higher than 1995. That's an increase of 6 percent annually, far more than inflation. It sounds like the Democrats don't have their facts straight, Eleanor."</FONT>
<p><b>Eleanor Clift (<i>Newsweek</i>):</b>  "The Democrats, the big mistake they've made is they ought to have advertisements about deterioration of quality, they ought to show an elderly person in a hospital, bell  ringing for a nurse who doesn't show up. That's where the cutbacks are going to be."
<p><b>Tom Brokaw (NBC):</b> "Are the Republicans most vulnerable here because they want to make these big cuts in Medicare and also give a tax cut, including tax cuts to those people making $100,000 or more?"
<p><b>John Yang (<i>Washington Post</i>):</b> "President Clinton has declared the GOP budget proposals too extreme and threatened a veto unless Republicans agree to scale back their $245 billion tax cut and the massive cuts in health care for the elderly and poor, welfare programs, student loans, and the Earned Income Tax Credit for the working poor."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b>  "I thought I just explained to you that under the Republicans there are no massive spending cuts proposed! And even with the tax cuts, the Republican plan projects tax revenues to increase by 41percent over the next seven years."</FONT>
<p><b>Dan Rather (CBS):</b>  "Republicans vowed to press for huge cuts in government spending and $245 billion in tax cuts. President Clinton vowed to veto it as too radical and to extreme."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b>  "Dan, are you listening? Oh, never mind. Let's move on. The political landscape. Who can the Republicans count on for support?"</FONT>
<p><b>Clarence Page (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>):</b> "Most of the KKK has joined the Republican Party."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b>  "Whoa! You may not like the Republicans, but where did that come from?"</FONT>
<p><b>Michael Gartner (<i>USA Today</i>):</b> "There's more to governing than likability. We learned that from the likable Ronald Reagan, who charmed us with stories as he amassed huge deficits and spent billions on goofy defense plans. No, the record is more important. And Bill Clinton's record is just short of terrific."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b> "Really? Conservatives, particularly the religious right, will tell you he's completely out of step with the cultural revolution sweeping the land. Just look at the outpouring of love for Pope John Paul II when he was here last month."</FONT>
<p><b>Timothy McNulty (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>)</b> "Without naming names or even mentioning the Republican-dominated Congress, the Pope seemed to admonish the supporters of propose laws to restrict immigration and dismantle many of the nation's programs for the poor. In doing so, he appeared to echo many of Presidents Clinton's warnings."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b>  "OK, so it's resolved: the Pope's a Democrat. We've only got a few seconds left. Last question to Cokie: Is there a bias in the media's coverage of the budget debate?"</FONT>
<p><b>Cokie Roberts (ABC):</b>  "I think there is a bias in favor of spending money, but I don't think it's liberal versus conservative, but a bias in favor of government programs and spending  money, even if there is not money there to spend and even if you're heaping debt on the next generation."
<p><FONT COLOR="2F4F4F"><b>Moderator:</b>  And that's the last word. A final programming note for our audience. I, of course, am a fictional creation. My guests are not, and neither is every single quote attributed to them. Have a good day.</FONT>

<center><h2>Prime Time's Missing Mangers</h2></center>
<dd><big>H</big>ave you noticed what's passing for holiday fare on prime time television these days?
<dd>Sure, the networks air special Christmas episodes of their shows, but how many actually deal with Christmas?
<dd>Here at the Media Research Center, our Entertainment Division decided to take a closer look at the content of the networks' holiday offerings.
<dd>In our review of 1994 prime time holiday-themed shows, we found that some contained secularized statements of religious principles, but only a few dealt with the Biblical significance of Christmas, or touched on Scripture at all.
<dd>Unfortunately, those same networks did manage to crank out a good deal of tastelessness and religion-bashing for airing during the Christmas season.
<dd>ABC's <ii>Roseanne</i> was the top offender both in 1994 and 1995. How difficult would it have been to offer one, just one episode that contained family values, that celebrated the Christmas spirit? Surely out of respect for the holiest seasons, Roseanne would tone down her assault on traditional values.
<p>
<center><i><font size=+1>Unfortunately, those same networks did manage to crank out a good <br>deal of tastelessness and religion-bashing for airing during the <br>Christmas season.</font></i></center>
<p>
<dd>But if you believe that you don't  know Roseanne. This is an actress who enjoys not just assaulting, but insulting family values. And she saves her best for Christmas.
<dd>Her 1994 episode concerned her son's erections at inopportune times, such as while standing at the chalkboard during class. The show ended with Roseanne reciting slang terms for erections: "pitching a trouser tent," "standing up for democracy," and so on. In 1995 she was even worse. So offensive was her December 12 episode that ABC moved the show from its usual 8:00 time slot to 9:30.
<dd>It centered on the wedding of Roseanne's boss Leon to Scott. Yes, a gay marriage, in the middle of the most family-oriented time of the year.
<dd>Not surprising that lewd "humor" pervaded the episode. When Scott, alluding to their upcoming honeymoon, suggested to Leon, "Next week, we could be snorkeling in the nude," Roseanne quipped, "Snorkeling, huh? Well, I guess you can learn a new word for it every day." Just before the wedding, Scott said to Leon, "I love you in a way that is mystical, eternal and illegal in twenty states." And after a minister performed the ceremony, they kissed. Merry Christmas from ABC Television Entertainment.
<dd>There was, however, one holiday program worth looking out for. A syndicated special entitled, <b><i>Red Boots for Christmas</i></b>, is helping to disseminate the true message of the season. 
<dd>The animated half-hour is based on a German folk tale which tells of a grouchy shoemaker who learns that the essence of Christmas is not wrapped presents under a tree, but rather God's gift to humanity: a Savior. 
<dd>Your support  of our enter-tainment division enables us to find new ways to expose how much Hollywood's leftist views differ from those people in Middle America.

<BR>
The PR Man Who Made Seattle a Great City</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER></CENTER>
<H4><CENTER>by Bruce Chapman</CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
	When you get a copy of the Seattle Arts Commission's Directory of Public
Art, you will see listings of statues to Christopher Columbus, Leif Erikson
and Dr. Jose Rizal, the hero of the Philippines. But we barely manage one
statue and a copper bust of Chief Seattle and a mere artistic &quot;silhouette&quot;
for the local pioneers Arthur Denny and David &quot;Doc&quot; Maynard (at
the Pioneer Square Metro stop).  And even as we prepare for next year's
100th anniversary of the Klondike Gold Rush, you will see no mention of
a statue--neither silhouette nor bas relief  --to honor the person who did
the most to establish Seattle as a world class city, Erastus Brainerd.<BR>
<BR>
	He is not in school history books (how would they know what to make of
him?), but he surely was one of the world's greatest public relations men,
and the first of a long line of such conjurers in Seattle. The very fact
that Seattle has reason to celebrate the Klondike Gold Rush at all, and
enjoys the excellent gold rush museum operated by the U. S. Park Service
across from Occidental Park, is due largely to the talents and gall of Erastus
Brainerd.<BR>
<BR>
	It was Brainerd, above all, who saw what the arrival in Seattle of a &quot;ton
of gold&quot; on the S.S. Portland in the summer of 1897 could mean for
its happenstance destination. The newly discovered gold fields in Dawson
City were some 1600 miles away in the Yukon Territory of Canada, but you
had to get there from somewhere on the West Coast. Vancouver and Victoria
were actually closer than Seattle. Tacoma and Portland were nearly as handy,
and San Francisco was bigger and better known. But Brainerd and his committee
 at the Chamber of Commerce persuaded the world that Seattle was the gateway
to the Yukon, and later Alaska.<BR>
<BR>
	The miners came here, it was said, and we mined the miners. Outfitting
stores were built, the ancestors of today's recreation equipment businesses,
shipping lines were founded, food distributors set up. A federal Assay Office
was established so that gold could be turned into U.S. currency. By 1911
Seattle had grown from a population of 65,000 to over 250,000 and was organizing
another public relations success, the Alaska Yukon Pacific Exposition. Brainerd's
public relations engineered a self-fulfilling boom and truly put Seattle
on the world map.<BR>
<BR>
	It would be nice to imagine that Brainerd achieved all this simply by sending
out a few new-fangled telegrams. But the campaign was far more extensive,
aggressive, and wily, if not deceitful. The historian Murray Morgan describes
how Brainerd &quot;wrote articles for national magazines, planted quotes
from the articles with the wire services, then used extracts from the wire
stories in advertisements which proclaimed Seattle the Emporium to the Klondike.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	Other northwest cities tried to use the wire services, too, but Brainerd
sent corrections to the papers, which got printed, and provided form letters
for newcomers to Seattle to write  letters to the editors of their former
hometown papers. He used State of Washington stationery to write to mayors
and governors around the country, and to foreigners, asking how many prospectors
they expected to be heading to Seattle en route to the gold fields. Ostensibly,
Seattle wanted to prepare for all the visitors, but the effort was just
another way of leaving  the impression that Seattle was, indeed, the gateway
to the Klondike.<BR>
<BR>
	Brainerd took out ads in The New York Journal, Cosmopolitan, Century, McClure's
and other magazines of the day, had the state Secretary of State print a
guide to Klondike prospectors that, naturally, routed them through Seattle,
and sent the folders to libraries all over the world. It also was Brainerd
who went around the Director of the U.S. Mint to get the assay office opened;
he did it by  enlisting a Pennsylvania Congressman--the brother of a Seattle
businessman--in getting a special law passed.<BR>
<BR>
	Brainerd himself deserves, but lacks, a biography. We know he was born
in Connecticut in 1855, graduated from Harvard College, married and had
two children,  and was a practicing journalist in the East until 1890. At
the start of the gold rush he was, of all thing, Paraguayan Consul in Seattle.
For a while after his successful gold rush publicity campaign he tried his
own luck in the Klondike, as a mining consultant--a mistake. Returning to
Seattle in 1904 he became editor of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer.  He
was active in the Republican Party and later wrote a five volume history
of great artists, and another book on &quot;Alaska and the Klondyke.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	Over the decades, Brainerd has been followed by a fabulous string of civic
leaders and PR promoters--from the people who organized the early civic
&quot;Potlatch&quot; events to those who started Seafair, from the creators
of the Century 21 World's Fair to those trying now to bring the  Olympic
Games to Seattle in 2008. <BR>
<BR>
	It was Brainerd who made Seattle big and rich and confident, but he himself
never cashed in. The final years of his life were spent in a mental hospital,
where he died Christmas Day, 1922, at age 67. <BR>
	We ought to put up a statue to Erastus Brainerd.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>For these purposes, it has little to do with greed. Or wanting to buy
too much at the mall to boost your self-esteem. <BR>
<BR>
Materialism is the modern day philosophy that holds that matter is all there
is. It's the philosophy that says &quot;If you can't touch it, smell it,
taste it or explain it through the hard sciences, it doesn't exist.&quot;
Men are merely complex machines and not spiritual beings. <BR>
<BR>
And it's approved by most intellectuals around the world. <BR>
<BR>
One other thing: we're out to topple it. <BR>

<H4>Darwinism is the belief that we evolved not only from the apes, but
that we started from nothing other than purposeless mass. As late Harvard
evolutionary biologist George Gaylord Simpson said, &quot;<I>Man is the
result of a</I> <I>purposeless and natural process that did not have him
in mind. He was not planned</I>.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Charles Darwin is to Materialism like Karl Marx is to Communism. Like Adam
Smith is to Capitalism. This is not to say that Darwin himself is responsible
for the full course of Darwinism since his death. But he opened the door.

<H4>Materialism is a powerful philosophy of life today because it sets the
boundaries for what is right and wrong in society. It explains the &quot;rules&quot;
that govern our civilization. It goes to the very intellectual roots of
society, the very foundation that our social and cultural institutions are
built upon. <BR>
<BR>
Indeed, if materialism is right &shyp; as most intellectuals propose &shyp;
then &quot;God&quot; is merely a figment of our imagination. Therefore,
God didn't create man; man created God. Doestoyevsky once said that &quot;
<I>if God is dead</I> <I>then all things are lawful</I>.&quot; Might makes
right. The State is the ultimate enforcer of rules. <BR>
<BR>
Let's look at how materialism has infected the legal system, welfare and
popular culture.<BR>

<H4><BR>
Materialism teaches us that God is dead. It follows that divine revelation
cannot be the basis of human law. <BR>
<BR>
Human law can only be based on upon the current opinion of the people who
have the power to make and interpret laws. In our society, that power rests
in the hands of an elite class of judges, lawmakers and other experts. <BR>
<BR>
&quot; We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are created
equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights&quot;
quickly loses much validity if our &quot;Creator&quot; does not exist. Result:
a culture of irresponsibility and victimhood. <BR>
<BR>
The present culture took decades to develop. Look at a 1930s text in criminal
law that upholds the materialist foundation: <BR>
<BR>
<I>&quot;Man is no more responsible for becoming willful and committing
a crime than a flower for becoming red and fragrant. In both instances,
the end products are predetermined by nature.&quot; <BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>Dating back to the 1960s, those who conceived the war on poverty believed
that poverty could be eradicated because they believed its root causes were
material: poverty, educational deprivation, crime, etc Thirty five years
later, we realize that throwing material resources at the problem has made
it worse, not better. <BR>
<BR>
By ignoring the moral and spiritual dimensions of poverty, we have ignored
the real problems of poverty: family breakdown, illegitimacy and government-fostered
dependency. </H4>

<H4>If morals are relative and nothing is absolute, anything goes. It requires
no deep intellectual digging to see how materialism has assaulted popular
culture. <BR>
<BR>
Popular culture seldom portrays religion favorably yet often with disdain.
Those characters who seem to hold traditional or conservative values will
surely be mocked, seen as &quot;square&quot; and even &quot;oppressors&quot;
of some sort of unalienable right bestowed upon humankind from Hollywood.

<H4>Much depends on how you define &quot;evolution.&quot; Some people think
evolution describes how things change over a period of time ( i.e. a finch's
beak length, a moth's color etc). Others think that slow and <BR>
gradual change to one organism can be translated directly into how life
itself was created. <BR>
<BR>
At a very basic level, we think evolution might explain the survival of
the fittest, not the <I>arrival </I>of the fittest and that it can explain
some form of development, but not original development. <BR>

<H1><CENTER>Tithing tax break offers better reform <BR>
than block-grant push </CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER><I>by Bruce Chapman</I> <BR>
<BR>
<HR></CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
Wailing critics in Washington, D.C. would like you to believe that America's
poor are about to be devastated by plans to block grant welfare funds and
send them to the states. The House of Representative's desire to add specific
mandates to that approach simply raises the wailing to a higher pitch. <BR>
<BR>
But the truth is that 70 of the 80 major federal and state welfare-related
programs are not affected by the reform bills, while those that are affected
will go through a slower rate of growth, not real reductions. Adopting &quot;workfare&quot;
or allowing the states to experiment with other structural changes does
not automatically assure more innovative use of the money, let alone savings.
<BR>
<BR>
Regardless of whether the Senate bill or the House bill emerges from the
conference committee set up to reconcile their differences, and regardless
of the President's relative enthusiasm,&quot;welfare as we know it&quot;
is not really going to end. But, maybe it should. <BR>
<BR>
Why must we always turn to government--at whatever level--for welfare solutions?
Since the 1960's &quot;War on Poverty,&quot; spending on cash and in-kind
transfers (cash, food, housing, energy, medical aid, etc.) has increased
640 percent in real, inflation-adjusted dollars. Yet most social problems--such
as out-of-wedlock birth rates--are far worse today. Perhaps welfare reformers
are not being &quot;radical&quot; enough. &quot;Radical,&quot; after all,
means getting at the roots, and when it comes to helping the poor, we need
to recognize that the private sectors of society--including churches and
other non-profit organizations, as well as the job-creating profit sector--tend
to do a better job than government. <BR>
<BR>
The challenge is to find ways to enable the non-government sectors gradually
to take on greater responsibility, while government's role is reduced. The
idea is not to leave the poor without friends, but to find them truer friends.
<BR>
<BR>
Rep. Mark Souder of Indiana proposes to stimulate private giving with an
increase in the tax deductibility of charitable donations, from 100 to 120
percent. Reps. Joe Knollenberg of Michigan and Jim Kolbe of Arizona would
give a $100 tax credit for gifts to community groups that work with the
poor. Sen. Coats of Indiana would increase that to $500. <BR>
<BR>
In Seattle, philanthropist and former businessman Mark Bloome asserts that
society would be spiritually improved overall and the poor allowed to advance
more surely, if the old Judeo-Christian ideal of the &quot;tithe&quot; could
be reinvigorated. He does not necessarily connect his idea with welfare
reform, but welfare reform certainly would benefit from being connected
with his idea. Tithing, the gift of 10 percent of one's income to the church
or other charity, is rare today, a victim mainly of high taxes. The answer,
Bloome believes, is to provide a federal tax credit for those charitable
contributions a person makes beyond five percent of his income (which are
tax deductible) and up to ten percent (the tithe). In contrast to a mere
deduction, the tithe would encourage people to give beyond the five percent
threshold, which is already a sacrifice, while the ten percent ceiling would
prevent tax-credited benevolence from bankrupting the federal treasury.
<BR>
<BR>
Tax reform advocates, as well as welfare reformers, would do well to consider
the wisdom of ideas like Bloome's. Experience in the 80's--when marginal
tax rates were lower and charitable giving was higher--and the 90's--when
tax rates went up and charitable giving stagnated--supports the common sense
expectation that people will give more when they have more to give. Thus,
lower and flatter tax rates probably will increase charitable giving even
as they boost the overall economy and personal income growth. <BR>
<BR>
What tax reformers tend to overlook is the political, if the not the moral,
desirability of linking a more productive tax system to one that assuredly
serves the poor directly. The tithing idea would do it. <BR>
<BR>
Private charity is intrinsic to the American character. It is more personal
and voluntary, and hence more moral, than government distributed tax funds.
And it tends to be more effective. Perhaps private charity cannot supplant
all government welfare, but it can redress the present imbalance. It offers
citizens of many political persuasions a potentially better choice than
either the present welfare mess or any of the conventional political proposals
for reform. <BR>
<BR>
It's time to get radical.

<H1><CENTER>For Canada breaking up is hard <BR>
-- and wrong -- thing to do</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER>by <BR>
<I>Bruce Chapman</I></CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
<BR>
Canada is a country where something terrible is always just about to happen,
but never does. The terrible thing is usually the secession of Quebec. The
mere possibility of a province seceding reminds a citizen of the United
States of what stability was bequeathed to our country by the Civil War.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In other respects, Canada's political scene is usually so calm that Americans
pay it no attention. We tend to see our northern neighbor as simply that
big happy vacation land that produces great comedians and Hollywood movie
locations that look more like American cities than our own do. &quot;Politics
in Canada&quot; sounds like the title of a boring book.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But hardly anything disturbs the political calm like breaking up one's country.
And in Canada that seems to be a constant and real threat. For nearly three
decades Canada, like Sisyphus, has been condemned to roll the rock of Quebec
up the hill of federalism, only to have it roll back down again, over and
over. Worse, federalist forces have to win every election held on on the
issue of separation, while secessionists need only win once. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Probably. In Canada, elections often settle even less than they do here,
especially since Canadians are masters of the art of Awkward Compromise
that leaves everybody somewhat satisfied, but also a little grumpy. If Quebeckers
next Monday vote for &quot;sovereignty&quot; and empowerment of provincial
leaders to negotiate a new relationship with the rest of Canada, it is still
unclear what that will mean in concrete terms. Prime Minister Jean Chretien
says it means separation, clear and simple. No more Canadian passports.
A division of the national debt, and no special favors. On the other side,
the Bloc Quebecois, led by Lucien Bouchard, argues that Quebec will be an
independent &quot;nation&quot; if the &quot;yes&quot; vote prevails, but
nationhood in this instance apparebtly is conceived as something between
the existence of a strong province and a truly foreign state. Both sides
claim the other is insincere and unrealistic.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Going into the final week of the campaign, the &quot;yes&quot; vote on sovereignty
was pulling ahead. If the final returns run along those lines, there will
be a political earthquake of long duration in Canada. Already, in dreadful
anticipation, the Canadian dollar and stock prices have been falling. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The best hope for federalism, acording to a former Liberal Party cabinet
minister, Gordon Gibson, who is now a fellow of the free-market Fraser Institute
in Vancouver, is &quot;ballot box chill.&quot; As seems to have happened
in 1980, Quebec voters may celebrate independence over the weekend, then
soberly vote their economic interests--which surely lie with federalism--the
next day.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
However, Quebec sovereignty is a deep cultural aspiration for many of the
francophone citizens of la belle province, and to the extent that economic
motives operate beyond that aspiration, popular disatisfaction over the
currently stagnant economy seems to make &quot;change&quot; the ally of
separation rather than of continued federalism. Sadly, Quebec is no different
than the rest of Canada in its bad fiscal management in recent years. Government
deficits at both national and provincial levels are so high that America's
appear mild in comparison and elsewhere even the dominant Liberal Party
has been forced to economy measures, many Quebeckers have not got the word.
Though they are, on balance, subsidized by the federal government, they
think their economic difficulties come from unfair treatment at the hands
of &quot;TROC&quot;--the rest of Canada.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That makes TROC as angry as reserved Canadians allow themselves to get.
Annoyance is especially strong in the West, and nobably across our border
in British Columbia.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That raises the obvious question, how would a &quot;yes&quot; vote in Quebec
affect us?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For Americans, especially those living close to the border, the obvious
question is, how will this affect us?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The answer is complex. However annoyed English (or better, non-French) Canada
may be with Quebec, the prospect of disunion would be a real blow to national
morale. Worldwide, Canadian prestige would be hurt. Despite the high cost
of keeping Quebec in the style to which &quot;le Belle Province&quot; is
accustomed, the loss of Quebec and the literal division of the country,
would damage Canada economically. Even more than the US, Canada needs budgetary
belt-tightening combined with sound growth if it is to avoid economic decline.
Yet, as the breakup of the USSR has shown, it is difficult to reform oneself
economically while the whole map is being redrawn.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Of course, Canada in not a basket case like some of the former Soviet states.
Unfortunately, Americans tend to think of Canada mainly as a place that
produces great comedians, shares our baseball games (where we fly their
flag upside down and get their national anthem wrong), and looks more &quot;American&quot;
in Hollywood movie productions than many locations in the United States.
It's our little brother that we alternately ignore or enjoy teasing.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But, in reality, Canada is a big, independent, powerful country. If it seems
less sometimes that is only because Canada is next door to, well, us. It
wins awards as the most &quot;livable&quot; country in the world. It is
democratic. In their quiet way, Canadians are passionate about freedom.
When times are tough, as when our diplomats were taken hostage by Iran,
or on any number of ocassions at the UN, when a confidential friend or honest
broker has been needed, Canada has taken on the job. In trouble spots around
the world or in a natural disaster, Canada is almost always at our side,
or there before us. Canada is our NATO ally. And our biggest trading partner.
Canada's well-being and its self-confidence matters--to us.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Of course, a vote for disunion may, once more, be avoided. Quebec's voters
may have their separatist victory party Saturday night and then sober up
the next day and again vote &quot;non.&quot; Alternatively, disunion for
a diminished Canada, if it happens could prove endurable, or even beneficial
for Canada. Like the Czech Republic without Slovakia or Slovenia without
the rest of Yugoslavia, a smaller Canada might actually prosper.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But, meanwhile, we in the Pacific Northwest have especially strong reasons
to be concerned about the Quebec vote. Our commercial and cultural ties
with British Columbia are growing stronger all the time. Regardless of the
Quebec vote, we have cause to persevere with our concept of &quot;Cascadia&quot;
as a cooperative region of US states--particularly Washington and Oregon--with
Western Canada--particularly B.C. We have great opportunities to promote
both sides of the border in this distinct and fortunate geographic region,
whether the collaboration is expressed in expanding tourism from overseas,
conducting ocassional joint trade missions, reducing border delays, improving
bi-national transportation, forming education partnerships among our universities,
boosting regional sports teams and arts activities, and just learning from
one another. Cross-border Cascadians have much in common, including a bright
future. Let us also make it plain that we have never wanted political union,
just friendship and cooperation. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The genuine crisis a Quebec separatist vote would cause Canada, and the
chronic frustration the issue will continue to cause in Canadian politics
even if the federalists prevail by a narrow margin, can evoke only one legitimate
response down here. Regret. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The best thing we can do after Sunday's vote is to emphasize how much we
in the Northwest value the close ties we have with our provincial neighbors
in &quot;Cascadia,&quot; as well as with the rest of Canada.

The current immigration debate founders on ignorance of one huge fact: Without
immigration, the U.S. would not exist as a world power. Without immigration,
the U.S. could not have produced the computerized weapons that induced the
Soviet Union to surrender in the arms race. Without immigration, the U.S.
could not have built the atomic bomb during World War II, or the hydrogen
bomb in the early 1950s, or the MIRVs in the 1970s or the cruise missiles
for the Gulf War in the 1990s. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today, immigrants are vital not only for targeted military projects but
also for the wide range of leading-edge ventures in an information age economy.
No less than military superiority in previous eras, U.S. industrial dominance
and high standards of living today depend on outsiders. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Every high-technology company, big or small is like a Manhattan Project.
All must mobilize the personnel best trained and most able to perform a
specific function, and deliver a product within a window of opportunity
as fateful and remorseless as a war deadline. This requires access to the
small elite of human beings in the world capable of pioneering these new
scientific and engineering frontiers. For many specialized high-technology
tasks, the pool of potential talent around the world numbers about 10 people,
or even fewer. 
<H4><BR>
<BR>
The Right People </H4>
<BR>
<BR>
If you are running such a technology company, you will quickly discover
that the majority of this cognitive elite are not citizens of your country.
Unless you can find the right people wherever they may be, you will not
be able to launch the exotic innovation that changes the world. Unless you
can fill the key technology jobs, you will not create any other jobs at
all, and your country will forgo the cycle of new products, skills, and
businesses that sustain a world-leading standard of living. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Discussing the impact of immigration, economists and their followers are
beady-eyed gnatcatchers, expert on the movement of cabbage pickers and au
pair girls and the possible impact of Cubans on Miami wage levels. But like
hunters in a cartoon, they ignore the tyrannosaurus rex crouching behind
them. Thus sophisticated analysts, such as George Borjas of the University
of California, San Diego, and artful writers, such as Peter Brimelow, conclude
that the impact of immigration on the U.S. economy is slight or negligible.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In fact, the evidence in overwhelming and undeniable; it is all around us,
in a spate of inventions and technical advances, from microwaves and air
bags to digital cable and satellite television, from home computers and
air conditioners to cellular phones and life saving pharmaceuticals and
medical devices. Without immigration over the last 50 years, I would estimate
that the U.S. real living standards would be at least 40% lower. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The underplaying of immigration as an economic force stems from a basic
flaw in macroeconomic analysis. Economists fail to account for the indispensable
qualitative effects of genius. Almost by definition, genius is the ability
to generate unique products and concepts and bring them to fruition. Geniuses
are literally thousands of times more productive than the rest of us. We
all depend on them for our livelihoods and opportunities. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The feats of genius are necessarily difficult to identify or predict, except
in retrospect. But judging from the very rough metric of awards of mathematical
doctorates and other rigorous scientific and engineering degrees, prizes,
patents, and publications, about a third of the geniuses in the U.S. are
foreign born, and another 20% are the offspring of immigrants. A third of
all American Nobel Prize winners, for example were born overseas. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A stellar example of these elates in action is Silicon Valley in California.
Silicon Valley companies have reduced the price of computer MIPs and memory
bits by a factor of some 10,000 in 2 1/2 decades. Although mainstream economists
neglect to measure the qualitative impact of these innovations, most of
the new value in the world economy over the last decade has stemmed, directly
or indirectly, from the semiconductor and computer industries, both hardware
and software. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Consider Intel Corp. Together with its parent Fairchild Semiconductor, Intel
developed the basic processes of microchip manufacture and created dynamic
and static random access memory. In other words, Intel laid the foundations
for the personal computer revolution and scores of other chip-bases industries
that employ the vast bulk of U.S. engineers today. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Two American born geniuses, Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, were key founders
of Fairchild and Intel. But their achievements would have been impossible
without the help of Jean Hourni, inventor of planar processing; Dov Frohmann-Benchkowski,
inventor of electrically erasable programmable ROMs; Federico Faggin, inventor
of silicon gate technology and builder of the first microprocessor; Mayatoshi
Shima, layout designer of key 8086 family devices; and of course Andrew
Grove, the company's now revered CEO who solved several intractable problems
of the metal oxide silicon technology at the heart of Intel's growth. All
these Intel engineers - and hundreds of other key contributors - were immigrants.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The pattern at Intel was repeated throughout Silicon Valley, from National
Semiconductor and Advanced Micro Devices to Applied Materials, LSI Logic,
Actel, Atmel, Integrated Device Technologies, Xicor, Cypress, Sun Microsystems
and Hewlett-Packard, all of which from the outset heavily depended on immigrants
in the laboratories and on engineering work benches. LSI, IDT, Actel, Atmel,
Xicor, and Sun were all founded or led by immigrants. Today, fully one-third
of all the engineers in Silicon Valley are foreign born. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now, with Silicon Valleys proliferating throughout the U.S. economy, with
Silicon Deserts, Prairies, Mountains, and even Alleys being hopefully launched
from Manhattan to Oregon, immigration becomes ever more vital to the future
of the U.S. economy. And microchips are just the beginning. On the foundation
of silicon have arisen world-leading software and medical equipment industries
almost equally dependent on immigrants. As spearhead of the fastest growing
U.S. industry, software, Microsoft offers some of the most coveted jobs
in the U.S. economy. But for vital functions, it still must turn to immigrants
for 5% of its domestic work force, despite the difficult and expensive legal
procedures required to import an alien. 
<H4><BR>
<BR>
Freedom of Enterprise </H4>
<BR>
<BR>
In recent congressional testimony, Ira Rubenstein, a Microsoft attorney,
declared that immigration bars could jeopardize the 58% of its revenue generated
overseas, threaten American dominance of advance &quot;client-server&quot;
business applications, and render &quot;stillborn&quot; the information
superhighway. In particular, Corning and other producers of fiber-optic
technology have faced a severe shortage of native engineers equipped to
pursue this specialty crucial to both telecommunications and medical instruments.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With U.S. high school students increasingly shunning mathematics and the
hard sciences, America is the global technology and economic leader in spite
of, not because of , any properties of the American gene pool or dominant
culture. America prevails only because it offers the freedom of enterprise
and innovation to people from around the world. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A decision to cut back legal immigration today, as Congress is contemplating,
is a decision to wreck the key element of the American technological miracle.
After botching the issues of telecom deregulation and tax rate reduction,
and wasting a year on Hooverian myths about the magic of a balanced budget,
the Republican Congress now proposes to issue a deadly body blow to the
intellectual heart of U.S. growth. Congress must not cripple the new Manhattan
Projects of the U.S. economy in order to pursue some xenophobic and archaic
dream of ethnic purity and autarky.

The Networks May Boycott the Conventions? Good!</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Bruce Chapman</I></CENTER>

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="starbar.gif" WIDTH="468" HEIGHT="25" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P>	We are all supposed to be concerned that television's Ted Koppel left
the Republican convention early and is not even going to appear in Chicago
for the Democrats' show. At San Diego, the big three networks saw their
ratings plummet and they ascribe this failure to Republicans scripting their
extravaganza so tightly that no &quot;story&quot; (also known as &quot;bad
news&quot;) broke loose. Next week, the Democrats' shindig may be just as
impervious to negative media spin--as it should be, if the Democrats have
any sense. In this contrived atmosphere, the networks are warning us that
they will consider not covering the conventions at all in the year 2000.
They're going to take their cameras and go home.<BR>
<BR>
	Now I call that really good news! It will be an excellent improvement in
politics for the next millennium.<BR>
<BR>
	In fact, if the networks do show up at future conventions, the parties
should allow them in only if they agree to reduce the number of their cloying
&quot;analyses,&quot;  floor interviews and other speech-usurping, distracting
and tendentious pelf. In San Diego, half of each network hour was taken
up by the commentators and, of course, the ads.  For example, instead of
being allowed to watch a newly discovered political gem like J.C. Watts,
the eloquent black Republican Congressman from Oklahoma, network viewers
were left with synthetic pearls from TV's shopworn celebrities. What matters
to the networks is not airing the conventions, but re-airing conventional
wisdom.<BR>
<BR>
	Overall, network convention coverage probably subtracts more from a voter's
understanding than it adds, just as self-absorbed network coverage of last
spring's primaries represented a net loss of popular deliberation in that
process (average sound bite per candidate: 7 seconds!). We can count on
similar coverage of the serious public business at hand this fall. Perhaps,
therefore, it would be just as well if the networks decided to stop covering
the final election, too. We mustn't keep them from the important fires and
hurricanes and two-headed giraffes that increasingly interest them.<BR>
<BR>
	The best advice to both parties is to stop trying so hard to please the
networks and their celebrity minions. Especially when it comes to live coverage
of political conventions, you don't need them anymore. Since the rise of
cable TV, voters have much better options, ranging from CNN, which is at
least somewhat less intrusive than the broadcast networks, to the totally
unobtrusive C-Span--the best innovation in the cause of  good government
since punch-card voting. And there's always PBS, not to mention radio and
even the comedy channel, where the humor's intentional.<BR>
<BR>
	The parties increasingly will find it advantageous to buy their own time
on TV and put their message across the way they want it, which is just what
the GOP did this year. By 2000 we'll have some version of a &quot;teleputer&quot;
(in George Gilder's phrase), computers with interactive TV capabilities
controlled by the user.  The viewer will be able to do his own editing,
as it were, listening to a convention speech in full or cutting away to
interviews or analyses as he or she--and not some network producer--desires.
When that happens, network TV convention coverage will become largely unprofitable,
anyhow. No high ratings, no big ads.<BR>
<BR>
	Meanwhile, parties have every right--and maybe a duty-- to run their conventions
to suit their own purposes, not those of the TV networks. Party conventions
are the great gatherings of the political tribes, a unique chance to showcase
familiar political favorites and emerging lights, and, for that matter,
for the party workers and leaders to mingle with counterparts from around
the country. Simply getting the party's act together is a service to the
voters; it makes each party prepare early for the possibility of governing.<BR>
<BR>
	If these communal rites are less spontaneous now than in days of yore,
it bears remembering that the scripting of conventions to look like TV shows
is directly the fault of TV itself.  Television first covered a political
convention in 1948.  By 1952, the parties were beginning to change their
procedures to accommodate the demanding new medium. In early 1956 a novel
called The Golden Kazoo accurately forecast the parties' growing obeisance
to TV and the techniques of &quot;Madison Avenue,&quot; a satiric vision
that became reality by 1960.<BR>
<BR>
	Parties and voters accepted the likes of Walter Cronkite and David Brinkley
as &quot;moderators,&quot; sitting in Olympian judgment on mere mortal candidates.
Presidential aspirants trembled at the thought that such worthies might
criticize them, even implicitly, though the media code of the time usually
prevented the networks' power from being so exercised. And if it was exercised
sometimes, the politicians, and of course the public, were too unsophisticated
to figure it out.<BR>
<BR>
	Today, the bias--usually left wing, occasionally right wing,  but almost
always skeptical and demeaning to the people in politics--is much more common,
and also more commonly understood and resented. In respect to conventions,
in any event, the parties finally learned that what made for good network
TV was not necessarily  what made for good politics. Hence, the scripting.<BR>
<BR>
	By 2000, however, it may not matter. If the networks follow through on
their threat to boycott the conventions, the only question by then will
be, who cares?<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>George Gilder mixes high technology and social politics.
His best-selling book, <I>Wealth and Poverty</I>, practically outlined our
loving embrace of high- tech entrepreneurs in the 1980s. Research for that
book led him deeper into the physics of silicon microchips. He emerged with
<I>Microcosm</I>, a book about how silicon-chip technology causes matter
to &quot;collapse&quot; into a microcosm where the usual economies of scale
are reversed: Small is better. <BR>
<BR>
The impact of decentralized telecommunications prompted his monograph <I>Life
After Television</I>, which is in some ways a warm-up for the book he is
working on now - <I>Telecosm</I> - a study of how the telecomputer will
enhance individual liberty. In this interview with Wired's Executive Editor
Kevin Kelley, Gilder expounds on society's current great work: wiring the
planet. </B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="rwbline.gif" WIDTH="540" HEIGHT="8" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P><B>KK</B>: Your book, Microcosm, begins with a quote from physicist Carver
Mead, who said, &quot;Listen to technology; find out what it's telling you.&quot;
I was wondering, what is the current technology of modems, packet-switching,
and fiber optics telling you?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B><BR>
GG</B>: It's telling me that today we're at the same general point that
we were with integrated circuits in about 1970. In 1970, people didn't anticipate
that transistors would be virtually free by today. Today you can buy a transistor
for 4,000-millionths of a cent. I think the same thing is on its way in
fiber optics. We're going to gain access to the 25,000 gigahertz of capacity
that's in each of the three windows in infrared spectrum that work with
fiber optics. With 25,000 gigahertz, you get the equivalent to the number
of phone calls in America during the peak moment on Mother's Day. Or take
all the radio spectrum currently used for communications, from AM radio
to KU-band satellite. It's 1,000 times that, on one thread of glass the
width of a human hair. I don't think people have come to terms with what
fiber really means. You can simulate any kind of switching configuration
you want. All of a sudden this huge apparatus of electronic switching that
dominates our current communications becomes unnecessary. Suddenly, you're
going to find that just as the integrated circuit rendered transistors -
and hence mips and bits - virtually free, fiber optics is going to render
bandwidth and hertz virtually free. This world is quite different from the
world that assumes bandwidth scarcity. A dearth of spectrum has to be regulated
and parceled out carefully by sensitive federal bureaucrats beset by tens
of thousands of lawyers. That whole apparatus, both the technology of it
- the huge switching fabric of the phone companies - and the legislative
apparatus and all its bureaucracies and legal accessories, are going to
be rendered almost worthless over the next ten years. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: Every time I hear the phrase &quot;virtually free&quot; I think
of the claim about nuclear power: &quot;too cheap to meter.&quot; It's almost
utopian. I find myself not believing it, as much as I want to go along with
the idea. Am I too skeptical? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Yep. It's just that when things become free you ignore them.
Transistors that used to be seven bucks apiece now cost about a millionth
of a cent. That means that you can regard them as insignificant, just as
they're becoming ubiquitous and thus determining the whole atmosphere of
enterprise. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: Well, you could say that aluminum - by the atom - has become
virtually free, but that doesn't mean aluminum in any useful amount is free.
As long as we have storage devices, we'll find things to fill them up with,
so there will always be a demand for more. That means no matter how cheap
storage becomes, it won't be free. It seems to me that the appetite for
bandwidth is equally insatiable, so people will always want more than they
have. It has to cost something. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Of course it will. The point is that in every industrial revolution,
some key factor of production is drastically reduced in cost. Relative to
the pervious cost to achieve that function, the new factor is virtually
free compared to its expense when it derived from animal muscle power and
human muscle power. Suddenly you could do things you could not afford to
do before. You could make a factory work 24 hours a day churning out products
in a way that was just incomprehensible before the industrial era. It really
did mean that physical force became virtually free in a sense. The whole
economy had to reorganize itself to exploit this physical force. You had
to &quot;waste&quot; the power of the steam engine and its derivatives in
order to prevail, whether in war or in peace. <BR>
<BR>
Over the last 30 years, we've seen transistors (or switching power) move
from being expensive, crafted vacuum tubes to being virtually free. So today,
the prime rule of thrift in business is &quot;waste transistors.&quot; We
&quot;waste&quot; them to correct our spelling to play solitaire, to do
anything. As a matter of fact, you've got to waste transistors in order
to succeed in business these days. My thesis is that bandwidth is going
to be virtually free in the next era in the same way that transistors are
in this era. It doesn't mean there won't be expensive technologies associated
with the exploitation of bandwidth - just as there are expensive computers
employing transistors; but it does mean that people will have to use this
bandwidth, they'll have to waste bandwidth rather than economize on bandwidth.
The wasters of bandwidth will win rather than the people who are developing
exquisite new compression tools and all these other devices designed to
exploit some limited bandwidth. <BR>
<BR>
One of the key ways you economize on bandwidth is switching. Switching has
been the whole foundation of our communications systems. You run narrow-band
wires to some switch and then switch the data to its destination in order
to avoid using lots of bandwidth to broadcast signals to every terminal.
It seems to me that we're going to start using fiber the way we currently
address air. Instead of switching, we'll broadcast on fiber optic. We'll
be tuning in rather than processing all the bits. And instead of using a
lot of switching intelligence in order to economize on bandwidth, we're
going to use bandwidth in order to economize on intelligence. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: Okay. In a world where physical force, switching, and computation
are almost free, we now add almost-free bandwidth. What becomes expensive?
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: The scarce resource is the human mind. People will be more valuable.
People will get paid better. We need people to provide the software, the
interfaces, the standards, and the protocols to all these systems that make
it possible to exploit these increasingly cheap resources. So it's the human
mind that you ultimately have to economize on. That's the reason I think
it's utter garbage to say that our grandchildren won't live as well as we
do. People who say this just don't see the technology. They live in this
bizarre world of thermodynamics, where entropy rules, and we're dominated
by our waste products. it is very short-sighted. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: It take it then that as a believer in the human mind as sort
of the ultimate repository of wealth and power, that you're not a believer
in artificial intelligence as an attainable thing?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Artificial intelligence is obviously attainable, it just won't
be human intelligence. It's a different function. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: Do you think there's a downside to having everything connected
to everything else? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: I don't see any. There must be a downside to the telephone, but
I can't remember what it is. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: Well, when you're in the middle of supper and some solicitor
is calling you, you'll probably remember what it is. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Yeah, that's the downside. But that's the downside all this stuff
overcomes. When you can have intelligence in you telephone it can defer
the calls you don't want to voice mail and still take emergency calls. It
can be adapted to your needs. So, the chief effect of these technologies
is to put you in command again. The trouble with top-down centralized technologies,
which the telephone and television represent, is that they're dumb equipment
attached to complex switching systems and broadcasting technologies. On
the other hand, the chief virtue of distributed intelligence is that the
network can be dumb and the control of it can be distributed to smart users.
That means that technologies are much more servants than rulers of your
life. <BR>
<BR>
<B><BR>
KK</B>: When I look at networks I see counter-intuitive behavior. Distributed
networks have a remarkable ability to be slightly out of anyone's control.
They possess an organic out-of-control quality. Does that concern you? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: I think it's good. The Internet, for instance, is an exciting
kind of metaphor for spontaneous order. It shows that in order to have a
very rich fabric of services you don't need a regimented system of control.
When there's a lot of intelligence at the fringes everywhere, the actual
network itself can be fairly simple. The future is dumb networks. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: Dumb networks? Why not smart networks? We put smartness into
everything else. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: There's smartness all around the network, but the actual network
should be essentially dumb glass. The fiberspace, as I call it. I think
the mistake that the phone companies sometimes make is to think that they
can keep up with the computer. What they call &quot;network intelligence&quot;
will usually appear as a bottleneck to a computer industry that's rapidly
rushing forward into new possibilities. So what you really want is dumb
networks where all intelligence is on the fringes. You'll have intelligent
devices of various sorts that are easily reachable from the network but
aren't part of the actual fabric of the network. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: What is the fabric of the network? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Photons. Electronics are not good for communications. Photons
- optical computing - are. What makes photons so great for communication
is they don't interfere with each other. They collide and pass on unaffected.
You can send them two-way, and they are not subject to electromagnetic disruption.
Many signals can flow through one fiber. But the fact that photons don't
affect each other means they are cumbersome for computing, since you want
interactions in computing. You need to have the charges affect one another
- that's the heart of computing. The heart of the transistor function is
that you can control a bigger force with a smaller force. But photons don't
control each other. So for computing functions I still think that electronics
will prevail; but for communications, photonics will prevail. <BR>
<BR>
<B><BR>
KK</B>: One would think that there is wealth to be made in the interface
then between photons and electrons. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Yeah, there is. Opto-electronics is very important. However,
opto- electronics should not be in the middle of the network, it should
be one the edges of the network where it links the computing functions to
the communications functions. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: There are some advocates who claim that we can get a lot of what
we want in fiber optic by using the existing copper wires beefed up with
the ISDN communication protocol. Do you go along with the idea of implementing
(and paying for ) ISDN right now? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Yes. The phone companies should do ISDN. We might as well get
as much out of the existing copper switch system as we can. ISDN is already
installed in all the new switches; it's more a matter of getting the tariffs
right so they can charge some reasonable amount for it is use. There's no
excuse not to do ISDN today. It won't detract from the fibersphere. But
while they do ISDN, all-optical networks are going to be launched all over
the place by different companies. Some people have this vision that either
we devote our resources to ISDN, or we devote them to creating this fabulously
expensive fiber network. My belief is that fiber network is going to get
rapidly cheaper, so that we're going to be able to do both it and ISDN perfectly
well. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: What role do you think the US government should play in laying
data highways? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: The role for the US government is to make government as efficient
as possible. Government operates leviathan laboratories, hospitals, universities,
bureaucracies, and post offices, and they all should be interconnected with
fiber. The government always discovers technology after its moment is passing.
If you're a winner, you don't go to the government. You're too busy. You've
got too many customers. It's the people with no customers who end up besieging
the government. There are all these wise-asses in Washington who really
think that they can choose technologies. They think they know better. They
get bowled over by every earnest representative of IBM who comes up to talk
to them. <BR>
<BR>
Just now the US government thinks that HDTV is absolutely the future of
the world because all the old farts at Zenith, and the broadcasting moguls
who aren't really making it with the new computer technologies, are converging
on Washington. it's always going to be that way. It's not going to change
with Clinton and Gore. The dog technologies run to Washington, decked out
like poodles. The politician is always the dogs best friend. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: There is a myth, a utopian hope, that all these electronic connections
(what I call the &quot;advent of the net&quot;) are going to eliminate hierarchy.
The belief is that we will come into a peer world, where everything is on
a peer-to- peer level. All the experimental work that I have seen shows
that that's probably not very likely. On the contrary, anything complex
self-organizes into nested hierarchies, just in order to manage itself.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Right. The complexity of digital systems requires a hierarchical
organization. It's the only way to deal with the kind of combinatorial explosions
that attend interlinking of billions of nodes, all functioning in parallel.
You need nested hierarchies, but the real miracle of micro- electronics
is that these extraordinarily complex hierarchies can be incorporated into
individual silicon chips, with virtual supercomputer power capabilities.
This fabulous supercomputer power can be ubiquitously distributed, which
renders them an egalitarian force. <BR>
<BR>
When everybody commands a supercomputer, you give the average owner of a
work station the power that an industrial tycoon commanded in the industrial
era, or that a TV station owner commands in the age of broadcasting. In
other words, the hierarchy is in the silicon rather than in the human organization.
So you have this incredible distribution of power. This is a period of transition
that resembles the transition between railroads and automobiles. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: How's that? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: When you ride a train you go to the railway station at a scheduled
time, you travel with the people that happen to be on the train, you go
to preset destinations. This is what the current television world is like.
You tune into the stations that have been prescribed through some collaboration
between advertisers and TV executives in New York and Hollywood. Moving
from broadcast model to the teleputer is like moving from a railroad model
to automobiles. Automobiles are essentially egalitarian transportation systems.
They aren't organized - like the Internet. A Ferrari, say, and a Toyota
Tercel look like radically different machines, but the fact is that any
car endows the average person with more freedom than any railroad. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: You are a tireless champion of small business. For the last 20
years or so, really big projects have been considered arrogant, incapable
of working because they are big. Now there is talk of Motorola's global
satellite project Iridium. Do you think that the fibersphere gives us permission
to think big again. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: There are going to be a lot of big fiber projects in the next
decade. They're already coming right now. I'm sort of worried that they're
going to think too small. I hope that the government, with its National
Research and Education Network (NREN) doesn't end up buying a lot of obsolescent
telephone company fiber systems that make networks with a total power of
a gigabit rather than a gigabit per terminal. The fibersphere is a big project,
and it will take scores of thousands of small companies to do it. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: What about big companies? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Sure. Laboratories where lots of people work on their own special
visions, with the luxury of very long-term goals, are very valuable. Such
places are usually supported by relatively big companies and consortia of
companies. IBM, AT&amp;T, and Bell Labs developed most of the component
for all optical networks. When you're producing millions of something it
becomes a commodity, and almost by definition you have a big company. MS-DOS
and Windows are commodity products, so Microsoft is a big company. <BR>
<BR>
There are cycles in which companies get big exploiting commodity products
with wide distribution, which then mature and then are displaced by new
products. It's relatively rare that the company that's triumphant in the
commodity phase. Insurrections are ordinarily led by entrepreneurs. I don't
see any likelihood that will change anytime soon. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: What else is the technology telling you? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: What the technology tells me is that, among other things, Clinton's
going to get a bonanza. He doesn't know what's coming, but technology's
just going to be breaking out all over. Bush did virtually everything that
Clinton promises to do, and because Bush has done it already it doesn't
leave Clinton much room except to play cock-a-doodle-do. He'll get up on
the post and crow as the marvelous sunrise technologies come blindingly
to the fore during his administration. They're going to have 50,000 technology
programs and behold, a million technologies will bloom and they will take
credit for it all. <BR>

Dear Representative 

After years of empty rhetoric, I am glad to see true reform 
brewing in Congress.  I look forward to the day when 
Congress reforms itself via the Citizen Congress Act.

If passed, an initiative such as the Citizen Congress Act 
will help restore my faith in elected officials.  For too 
long, we have been made promises while important measures 
such as term limits and a Balanced Budget Amendment have 
not materialized.

By eliminating perks and wasteful practices from within, 
Congress can begin to reverse the hollow promises of the 
past several years. Abolishment of the federal pension 
system, elimination of franked mass mailings, non-automatic
pay increases, and reduced military aircraft travel are 
significant reforms which also reduce government spending. 
At a time when the country's budget is in poor fiscal 
condition, there is little reason not to tighten the belt 
of Congress.

I was disappointed to see term limits measures fail, yet 
I believe that the Citizen Congress Act is a step in the 
right direction in regards to congressional reform.  I 
understand that Members of Congress work hard and are 
very busy, but I also believe Congress needs to truly 
reidentify with the voters of this country.  I ask that 
you pledge support for this measure, and I look forward
to your reply.

Sincerely,
</textarea>

<HR><BR>
The noise you hear coming from Washington, D.C. is not the screeching prelude
to a budgetary &quot;train wreck.&quot; It's only the noise of a rhetoric
wreck. There is nothing at all unusual about the failure of Congress and
the President to reach agreement on a budget by the formal deadline, October
1 (this Sunday). And the &quot;crisis&quot; over the debt ceiling that is
slated to follow later on this fall is only slightly more worrisome. We
have gone through such &quot;crises&quot; many times since the 1970's. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
On one occasion, when Budget Director Jim Miller warned Ronald Reagan that
refusal to reach a compromise with the Democratic Congress could bring government
operations to a halt, the President replied, &quot;Jim, Jim, settle down.
Let's close the place down and see if anybody notices.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Nobody did. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In similar stalemates now Congress almost routinely adopts a &quot;continuing
resolution&quot; that allows spending on essential services (such as defense)
and entitlements (such as Social Security) to carry on, and for other programs
to operate at a maintenance level. Such a resolution is available this weekend.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The situation will not be much different around mid-November if Congress,
on another issue, tries to force financial discipline on the Administration
by refusing to raise the federal debt limit. Mr. Clinton and his allies
already are warning that Republican &quot;blackmail&quot; will spook the
markets. Air traffic will be grounded. Federal contractors will be stiffed.
Children will starve. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps these horror tales are meant to frighten us out of that national
&quot;funk&quot; that concerns the President. Or perhaps the Democrats are
just getting an early start on Halloween. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
No, all the whoops of distress have but one purpose, which is to deflect
the majority in Congress from doing what they promised: to cut the budget
now in order to balance it by 2002. The people whose careers are built on
an ever-expanding government sector--people who believe that downsizing
is only for the private sector--are going to try to make you believe that
the world is coming to an end. But it's only their political assumptions
that are ending. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Don't get me wrong. Many proposed budget cuts are difficult to accept. Some
reductions don't make sense when considered by themselves. And almost all
of us are for government spending when it favors a cause close to our own
hearts. I can see the desirability of eliminating the national service program,
&quot;Americorps,&quot; but a student benefiting from its payments probably
does not. Consumers in Seattle and New York might cheer the overdue effort
to end farm subsidies, but it's a hard sell in Louisiana cotton country
or Wisconsin dairlyand. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, the truth is that relatively little of the budget savings needed
will be achieved just by cutting &quot;waste, fraud and abuse,&quot; or
even by tackling special interest spending. At some point, you have to go
into broadly popular programs. That Republicans are doing so, though gingerly,
and that these reductions are being presented before television cameras
as the mad slashing of mean-spirited conservatives, accounts for the sagging
public approval ratings of Congress. Yet, with a national debt equal to
$71,860 per family of four, we just can't afford all the good things government
intends to do for us. Spending growth needs to slacken. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Likewise, taxes do need to go down. The reason is not to make the rich richer,
but to raise our savings rate, spark the investments that create jobs and
to help working families make ends meet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The question for voters is, do you really want to stay on the track to long
term economic growth, or do you want to derail the train at the first signs
of difficulty? For the Republican majority in Congress, the question is
almost identical. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, most Democrats, as in the '80's, have already given their
answer: Real cuts are for budgetary &quot;outyears,&quot; Washington, D.C.'s
equivalent of the sweet-by-and-by. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But unlike the 80's, when Republicans occupied the White House and Democrats
controlled Congress, the tactical advantage is now with the GOP. If Congress
wants to spend, a President has few ways to prevent it. If--as now--Congress
does not want to spend, the President has even fewer ways to force it to
do so. In a contest of wills, Congress probably can stand the pressure better
than the President. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That means they also may not be deterred by short term drops in the polls.
Perhaps the left has forgotten a pertinent lesson from the past, but it
has not been forgotten by the GOP elephant. In 1990, when President George
Bush tried to force budgetary restraint on a Democratic Congress, the artificial
heat generated in the ensuing &quot;crisis&quot; was especially intense.
Bush finally cracked and backed down. In return for limited future spending
controls, he agreed to break his pledge on taxes (Remember &quot;Read my
lips&quot;?). He was a hero to the media at the time, a real statesman.
And the voters didn't seem to care much--until they trounced him soundly
in the next election. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In 1994 the Republicans ran on a Contract with America. They told the voters
exactly what they wanted to do: cut spending, cut taxes and revive America's
economic growth. And they won a history-making victory. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
They are now trying to do what they promised. Boogeymen are being thrown
up to scare them off track, including Mr. Clinton's holograph of a government
&quot;train wreck.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But the ghost of George Bush scares them a lot more. <BR>

Dear Senator 

After years of empty rhetoric, I am glad to see true reform 
brewing in Congress.  I look forward to the day when 
Congress reforms itself via the Citizen Congress Act.

If passed, an initiative such as the Citizen Congress Act 
will help restore my faith in elected officials.  For too 
long, we have been made promises while important measures 
such as term limits and a Balanced Budget Amendment have 
not materialized.

By eliminating perks and wasteful practices from within, 
Congress can begin to reverse the hollow promises of the 
past several years. Abolishment of the federal pension 
system, elimination of franked mass mailings, non-automatic
pay increases, and reduced military aircraft travel are 
significant reforms which also reduce government spending. 
At a time when the country's budget is in poor fiscal 
condition, there is little reason not to tighten the belt 
of Congress.

I was disappointed to see term limits measures fail, yet 
I believe that the Citizen Congress Act is a step in the 
right direction in regards to congressional reform.  I 
understand that Members of Congress work hard and are 
very busy, but I also believe Congress needs to truly 
reidentify with the voters of this country.  I ask that 
you pledge support for this measure, and I look forward
to your reply.

Sincerely,

<H1><CENTER>The Roots of Black Poverty </CENTER>

<H3><CENTER>by<BR>
<I><A HREF="gildrbio.html">George Gilder </A></I></CENTER>
</H3>
<H5><A HREF="dispfthr.html">Read a response to this article by <BR>
Washington Post columnist William Raspberry</A></H5>
<BR>
<HR>Dinesh D'Souza is currently the perplexed benificiary and victim of
an uproar over his book <I>&quot;The End of Racism,&quot;</I> which emerged
in the midst of a momentous furor over the centrality of race in America.
Except for the always bravely Olympian sage Thomas Sowell, even conservative
blacks have fiercely renounced much of his argument along with his intemperate
language. How can anyone deny the power of racism in the face of the taped
ruminations of Mark Fuhrman, the rhetoric of Louis Farrakhan the indignant
voices at the Million Man March, the radical split between the races reacting
to the acquittal of O.J. Simpson? <BR>
<BR>
I know how Mr. D'Souza feels. In 1979, I published a book called <I>&quot;Visible
Man: A True Story of Post Racist American.&quot;</I> Now this book is being
republished by the ICS Press in San Francisco. <I><A HREF="visible.html">&quot;Visible
Man&quot;</A></I> showed that white racism was not a significant problem
for American blacks in the late 1970's. If white racism was not much of
a problem in 1978, it is manifestly not a problem in 1995. <BR>
<H4>Black Achievement </H4>
<BR>
Neither I nor Mr. D'Souza denies the existence of racial feelings in America
and throughout the world. But far from being hostile to black achievement,
American whites celebrate blacks at every opportunity. In the truest test,
governed by messive voluntary choices in the marketplace, Americans have
made the National Basketball Association, 80% black, the most popular sports
league, Whitney Houston the most popular and richest American singer, Bill
Cosby the most popular and richest comedian, and Oprah Winfrey the most
prosperous entertainer. Far from showing racism, American employers, mostly
white, have given black women higher earnings, on average, than comparable
white women. Between 1973 and 1994, the current-dollar revenues of the top
100 black owned industrial companies, as listed by <I>Black Enterprise</I>
magazine, rose from $473 million to $6.7 billion, plus $4.9 billion in revenues
from auto dealerships. Blacks in America have far outperformed blacks in
any other society with a substantial black population. <BR>
<BR>
In my view, the most important finding in <I>&quot;The Bell Curve&quot;</I>
by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray was that after controlling for
age, IQ and gender, the average full-time worker actually out-earns the
average white by 1%. Let the IQ number stand for real educational attainment
(as opposed to degrees in easier subjects and from less rigorous institutions),
and it is clear that racial discrimination no longer limits black earnings.
A more appropriate standard, though, would include a correction for marital
status, since married men of all races earn some 30% more than single men
of the same age and credentials. Correcting the Murray figures for marital
status gives black men a dramatic edge in earnings over white men. Although
such comparisons are full of pitfalls, it is safe to say that black men
in the U.S. today earn more, not less, than truly comparable whites. <BR>
<BR>
Rather than admit this reality, the intelligentsia, black and white, would
rather pusue fantasies of racial hatred. As I discovered during appearances
related to the original publication of <I>&quot;Visible Man,&quot;</I> and
as Mr. D'Souza is now learning, denial of racism today is widely seen as
evidence of it. In the face of the fury of the charges of bigotry, whites
find it easier to go along than to tell the truth. <BR>
<BR>
Public opinion polls, for example, show that the beating of Rodney King
galvanized a newly intense feeling of alienation among blacks in America.
Yet anyone, regardless of race, who took the police on an eight- mile, high-speed
chase, and then charged at them at the end, should be grateful if he is
not shot (rather than beaten). Sensible people learn not to defy or insult
police officers who are performing an inevitably messy and treacherous job
under tremendous strain. Yet the white media almost unanimously confirmed
the black outrage. Today whites indulge the idea of reasonable doubt in
the Simpson trial, as if it were possible that a team of policemen would
or could contrive an instant frame-up of a supremely popular black athelete.
<BR>
<BR>
In effect, all America treats blacks as children who cannot be told the
truth. From Harvard Law School deans to ghetto social workers; from the
chairman of the New York Times to the editors of Time magazine, to the steady
drumbeat of three broadcast networks, eminent whites are constantly confirming
blacks in the crippling comfort of their belief in white racism. <BR>
<BR>
If racism explains next to nothing about black poverty and crime, what does
explain it? What is the real cause, so unspeakably unwelcome that it drives
opinion toward almost any other explanation, however false or unsavory?
The chief cause of black poverty is welfare state feminism. Thirty years
of affirmative action programs have artificially elevated black women into
economic power over black men. <BR>
<BR>
This regime prevailed from the highest levels of the economy, where black
female college graduates with five years on the job significantly outearned
black men in 1991, to the underclass, where a typical package of welfare
benefits produced disposable income 28% above a typical job in 1994. It
prevailed on college campuses, where more than 60% of the blacks are women.
It dominated government job training programs, where girls are found to
benefit far more than boys. It even invaded such male bastions as the cockpits
of fighter planes, police squad cars, fire stations, construction sites
and university athletic teams. In a grotesque abuse of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964, judges have interpreted Title IX of the 1972 amendments as
requiring academic institutions, in effect, to retrench scholarships and
opportunities for superior black male athletes to advance the careers of
measurably inferior female athletes, white and black, soley on the basis
of sex. <BR>
<BR>
It is an unpopular fact of life that in all societies and in all races monogamous
marriage is based on patriarchal sex roles, with men the dominant provider.
Welfare state feminism destroyed black families by ravaging the male role
of provider. <BR>
<BR>
Some observers claim that black communities benefit from matriarchal institutions.
Looking more closely, however, you will find inner cities implacably ruled
by gangs of young men, with the &quot;matriarchs&quot; cowering in their
triple bolted apartments in fear of them. <BR>
<BR>
Men either dominate as providers or predators. There is hardly any other
option. The key problem of the underclass - the crucible of crime, the source
of violence, the root of poverty - is the utter failure of socialization
of young men through marriage. The problem resides in the nexus of men and
marriage. Yet nearly all the attention, subsidies, training opportunities
and therapies of the welfare state focus on helping women function without
marriage. The welfare state attacks the problem of the absence of husbands
by rendering husbands as entirely superfluous. &quot;Welfare reform&quot;
continues the policy giving welfare mothers new training and child care
benefits and further obviating marriage by pursuing unmarried fathers with
deadbeat dad campaigns. <BR>
<BR>
Today, in large American cities, fully 40% of young black men between the
ages of 17 and 35 are in prison, on probation, or on the lam; and some 40%
of young black women say they have been forced into unwanted sexual activity.
To fear young black males has become a mandate for survival on the streets
of many American cities. This unspeakable social tragedy - with all its
infuriating reverberations on law-abiding balck citizens - is the inevitavble
harvest of government policy. <BR>
<BR>
<H4>The Great Fiasco </H4>
<BR>
Even Margaret Mead recognized that in all cultures family values depend
on religious supports and male providers. The effort to unculcate ethical
behavior and sustain marriage without religious faith is the great fiasco
of the modern age. In order to relieve the pain of the poor, our soicety
must come to recognize that their problem is not lack of jobs or lack of
money but moral anarchy originating with the establishment and most sorely
victimizing blacks. <BR>
<BR>
With both the black and white establishments and even the leading Christian
churches succumbing to the siren appeal of unisex policy, what could be
more predictable than the emergence of patriarchal religion - however offensive
in some ways - as a galvanizing force among black men. If Mr. Farrakhan
is deeply culpable for his ethnic fanaticism, surely the entire U.S. establishment
is equally culpable for its fanatical assault on family roles. For all races,
patriarchal religion has played a central role in human civilization. Patriarchal
black churches, from Father Divines' mid-century movement to Christian fundamentalists
and Black muslims today - have served more as part of the solution than
as part of the problem of black poverty. <BR>
<BR>
These lessons have become increasingly relevant to whites who imagine that
they can sustain a civilization based on secular liberation from monogamous
sex roles. As the white illegitimacy rate moves toward the level reached
by blacks at the time of the Moynihan Report - and decisively surpasses
it in Britain - the events of recent weeks should ring a tocsin for all
Americans. <BR>

    <TITLE>Disposable Fathers by William Raspberry</TITLE>

</H3>
<BR>
<BR>
What's wrong with welfare? Here's an answer you haven't heard: <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The key problem of the welfare culture is not unemployed women with
illegitimate children. It is the women's skewed and traumatic relationships
with men and boys. In a reversal of the usual pattern in civilized socieitie,
the women have the income and the ties to government authority and support.
The men are economically and socially subordinate.... This balance of power
virtually prohibits marriage which is everywhere based on the provider role
of men counterbalancing the sexual and domestic superiority of women.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I almost don't want to mention the source of this arresting notion - conservative
<A HREF="gildrbio.html">George Gilder</A> writing in the conservative American
Spectator (June 1995) - for fear that the name and affiliation might lead
some readers to suspend thought. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
You see, of course, where Gilder is headed: Men, he believes, are the key
to strong families. And they are, the more successful welfare is - even
if it leads women to jobs, child care and improved earnings - the worse
it will be for families, because it will &quot;render the men still more
optional, desperate, feral, and single.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Does any of this make sense? How would I feel, hearing this indispensable-man
argument, if I were female - especially if I were a single mother? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Already there has been a stream of books and articles (several of the latter
by me) arguing the negative effects of absent fathers on children and on
communities, or contending that the breakdown of marriage is the leading
indicator of social pathology, or otherwise calling for reclamation of men
and boys as the means of rescuing society. The Million Man March only underscored
the notion. Women must be wondering what makes us think men are God's primary
gift? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Well, Gilder isn't quite saying we are. What he is saying is that children
need their fathers, too - and so do their mothers - and that welfare almost
calculatedly drives the men away, perpetuating both the worst effects of
welfare and the need for it. Listen: <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The entire welfare state - from Donna Shalala to Bob Dole's Senate
offices - is relentlessly feminist, mandating preferences for women on construction
sites, in police cruisers, in Air Force jets and in athletic scholarships.
These programs necessarily concentrate their job incentives, training benefits,
and subsidies on women rather than on men because, in general, it is only
the mothers who are on welfare. The fathers use the apartments and take
the money of a series of welfare mothers, usually without joining the dole.
Thus the recipients of welfare-related work will mainly be women. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;But we know from reams of studies and centuries of experience that
only fathers can satisfactorily sustain families, reliably discipline teen-age
boys, and lift a community from poverty. The idea that welfare mothers can
do it while the government raises their children is incredibly naive....
The very idea that women with small children should work outside the home
is perverse. The welfare state has already deprived these children of fathers.
The workfare state proposes to take away the mothers as well.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Implicit in Gilder's analysis is his thesis of woman as civilizer of naturally
predatory man. How does she do it? By demanding commitment (which she needs)
in exchange for sex (his priority). Welfare eliminates the economic basis
for the commitment. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Unless they are tamed by marriage and the provider role,&quot; he
says, &quot;men become enemies of civilization and revert to their primordial
role as predators.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Is this blame-shifting drivel, as some surely will contend? Or has Gilder
found the virus that is killing our families and our communities? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
He says it too harshly and too categorically, perhaps, but I think he is
on to something. The natural promiscuity of men combined with the increasing
unnecessity of men (except for sex) produces a breed frighteningly close
to Gilder's description of &quot;optional, desperate, feral and single.&quot;
We have to make men necessary again. <BR>

Between 1980 and 1992, casual drug use in America declined sharply.  Strong presidential leadership helped cut casual drug use in half between 1977-1992, and reduced the number of cocaine users from almost 3 million in 1988 to 1.3 million in 1992.
<P>
Since 1992, however, a sustained, intelligent and integrated anti-drug effort has been largely abandoned.  The results are not surprising:  the last four years have brought the greatest increase in teen drug use ever measured.  Consider the facts:
<P>
Illicit drug use is soaring among Americas young people.  Overall use of drugs among 12-17 year olds rose 105 percent between 1992 and 1995.  Fully 2.42 million youths ages 12-17 use drugs on a monthly basis.

Marijuana use functions as the "gateway" to hard drugs.  According to the Center on Addiction and substance Abuse (CASA), teens who use marijuana are 85 times more likely to "graduate" to cocaine than those who abstain.  As CASA director, Joseph Califano noted, "The jump in marijuana use among Americas children from 1992-94 signals that 820,000 more of these children will try cocaine in their lifetime . . . Of that number, about 58,000 will become regular users and cocaine a ddicts.</blockquote></td></tr>

<center><h3>
Statement by William J. Bennett<br>
on results of the<br>
National Household Survey on Drug Abuse
</h3>
<p>
<I>August 20, 1996</I>
</center>
<p>
The huge increase in drug use reported today in the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse for 1995 is a national disgrace.  And the Clinton administration should be ashamed of its complete abdication in fighting illegal drug use.
<p>
Since 1992, we have watched the number of drug users go up -- way up -- year after year.  Today we learn that drug use among young people has surged again -- this time by 33 percent between 1994 and 1995.  Monthly use of marijuana use among the young is up by 37 percent between 1994 and 1995, and up 141 percent since 1992.  This has occurred after a reduction of overall drug use of more than 50 percent between 1979 (the peak) and 1992 and a reduction of almost 80 percent in cocaine use between 1985 (peak for cocaine) and 1992. 
<p>
There has been a well-documented and complete failure of public policy.  But make no mistake: there is more involved here than merely a failure of public policy.  Public policy, after all, is a manifestation of attitude.  And the "root cause" of the Clinton administration's abdication in the battle against illegal drug use is moral confusion and moral weakness.   
<p>
The Clinton administration, for whatever reason, is cavalier, unengaged, and unconcerned about illegal drugs.  It is unwilling to take a strong and unambiguous stand against drug use.  Democratic congressman Charles Rangel expressed the opinion of many when he said, "I've been in Congress over two decades, and I have never, never, never found any administration that's been so silent on this great challenge [illegal drug use] to the American people."  The motto of the Clinton administration seems to be, "We Just Don't Care" -- and so they are unwilling to act in responsible and effective ways.  Unfortunately this nation is paying a very heavy price for the Clinton administration's diffidence, in terms of wrecked and lost lives.  
<p>
On the one issue that disproportionately harms the poor -- that is wiping out many children of the poor -- Bill Clinton and his administration have demonstrated massive indifference.  The burning of black churches has caused justifiable outrage in the country.  President Clinton has taken it upon himself to speak out, time and again, against church burnings.  And he is right to do so.  But drugs have destroyed many, many, many more black families than church burnings.  Yet on the drug issue Bill Clinton is virtually silent -- in word and in deed.  Even before today's news, we knew that since Bill Clinton became president the nation has suffered the greatest increase in drug use and the largest expansion in the supply of illegal drugs ever measured.  The Clinton administration keeps adding to its infamy.  Fighting the drug epidemic requires courage, intelligence, determination, and above all, moral clarity.  Moral clarity is precisely what is missing at the top of this administration, as well as among the White House staff.

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Scott Klug, clean cut and earnest, used to be a reporter
for KING-TV in Seattle. </B>He liked to investigate politicians. You would
not have suspected that he would wind up in Congress himself one day, but
that is what happened. Having returned home to Madison ,Wisconsin, Klug
got elected as a Republican to the House of Representatives. Now in Washington,
D.C.--still clean cut and earnest--he focuses a lot on cutting costs and
privatizing government programs. And he is making some progress. <BR>
<BR>
The Republican House majority, including Klug and his Washington State colleagues,
deserves credit for reducing spending growth and making a balanced budget
by 2002 a realistic goal. It wouldn't have been possible without the Republicans'
sometimes stormy insistence, and if they lose power this fall, that goal
surely will erode. But they got in political trouble when their cuts hit
some highly visible services with broad constituencies. Everybody wants
Congress to combat &quot;waste, fraud and abuse,&quot; but one voter's idea
of waste is another's idea of a vital service. <BR>
<BR>
Similarly, almost everybody would like a tax cut, as Republicans propose.
It is, or ought to be, common knowledge that when federal, state and local
taxes are combined, the American family is more heavily taxed than ever
before. But, how do you pay for a broad cut? There will be a supply side
boost to revenues when marginal tax rates are cut, but it will cover only
about a quarter of the tab. <BR>
<BR>
We clearly need greater efficiencies in government. Klug believes that government
monopolies, lacking the discipline of the free market, raise costs directly
and--by not paying taxes--indirectly, too. Privatization, while not a panacea,
can lower government costs and still improve services. <BR>
<BR>
Privatization was a subject of fashionable discussion in the 1980s, but
few actual conversions were undertaken. Selling off Conrail, the government-subsidized
freight railroad that had been picked up when Penn Central, New York Central
and several other lines failed, was one of the stellar successes. That privatization
was led by Ronald Reagan's Secretary of Transportation, Elizabeth Dole,
and turned a multi-billion dollar public revenue eater into a multi-billion
dollar tax contributor. (The Dole campaign should make more of this story.)
Klug is now among those promoting the current proposal to privatize Amtrak
passenger service. <BR>
<BR>
Klug's efforts led Speaker Gringrich last year to appoint him head of a
House privatization task force that includes, among others, Rep. Jennifer
Dunn of Bellevue, Washington. An initial effort was the abolition, privatization
or partial privatization of some nine programs within the House of Representatives
itself--from beauty and barber shops to food services and recording studios.
As Gingrich recently noted on Meet the Press, the old House still had ice
delivered twice daily to each Member&iacute;s office--80 years after invention
of the refrigerator. Most of these in-House reforms are now completed, with
expected ultimate savings to taxpayers of $44 million, a good example for
the rest of government. <BR>
<BR>
The Clinton Administration has made a few modest moves toward privatization,
of course, such as agreeing with Congress to sell the Naval Petroleum Reserves
(at an anticipated price of $1.6 billion). But Klug is skeptical of any
serious or long term Clinton commitment. Dole is much more interested. Whoever
is president, however, Klug has a long list of privatization targets. They
involve sale or lease of assets, contracting out of services, functional
conversion to the private sector and lifting legal barriers to privatization.
For example: <BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
  <LI> Klug and his task force want to contract out the debt collection
activities of the IRS. Citing a General Accounting Office report and a survey
by the American Collectors Association, Klug foresees savings of over $10
billion. 
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
  <LI>$80 million could be saved by privatizing many activities of the Government
Printing Office. 
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
  <LI>Money to build badly needed new prisons could be found by turning
some operations over to private companies, which experience shows can construct
and manage prisons for 20 % less than the government. 
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
  <LI>Contracting out government commercial-style services could save &quot;as
much as $9 billion a year.&quot; Klug cites as examples the Department of
Defense and the Veteran&iacute;s Administration, which compete with the
private sector in grocery distribution. 
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
  <LI>Privatizing management of federal loan programs could save $2 billion
annually. 
</UL>
<BR>
Some of the GOP proposals Klug is introducing will require more study and
debate. For instance, he wants to move, though slowly, to sell off the electric
power projects built in the '30s and 40s. This would have been politically
unimaginable several decades ago, but, as shown in a report this month by
a bi-partisan task force of governors from the four Northwest states, even
the huge and venerable Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) is coming under
increased consideration for privatization, at least for its power transmission
system. The power industry is moving into greater competition these days
and a co-existent government monopoly makes less and less sense. Klug wisely
suggests privatization &igrave;from least to most complex&icirc;power marketing
administrations, starting with Southeastern Power Administration, and reviewing
Western Area Power Administration and BPA last. <BR>
<BR>
Perhaps it is remarkable that anyone is even able to talk about such matters
these days. Barry Goldwater's proposal in 1964 to sell the Tennessee Valley
Authority (TVA) helped defeat him. But few attack Klug in 1996 for wanting
to bring at least the non-power programs of TVA into the private, tax-paying
sector, at a savings of $140 million a year, and he bravely asks why regulated
private ownership of TVA power would not also make sense for citizen rate-payers
in today&iacute;s environment--as well as earning $28 billion for the federal
treasury. <BR>
<BR>
There, indeed, are few sacred cows in the Wisconsin representative's budget
pasture. He even dares to mention the Postal Service. Barry Goldwater himself
didn't raise such an issue. If he had, it would have been thought a joke.
But that was before private overnight mail delivery, faxes and e-mail. Now
Klug's suggestion that the Post Office evolve into an employee-owned corporation
doesn't strike most people as either ridiculous or extreme. More and more,
it sounds like common sense.<BR>

A Cheaper, Surer Way to Fund and Build Public Projects</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER>by Bruce Chapman</CENTER>
</H3>
<IMG SRC="barrwb.gif" WIDTH="468" HEIGHT="7" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=
"BOTTOM"><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>How are we going to pay for it all?</B> Isn't there any way to lower
the costs? These are the plaintive cries of taxpayers around the country
as their local and state elected officials try to cajole them into supporting
a growing list of infrastructure projects.<BR>
<BR>
But even as the list grows, taxpayer tolerance for big ticket public works
is declining. In Seattle, for example, where voters this week passed (turned
down) a $50 million bond measure to help build the &quot;Commons&quot;park
near the downtown, wary but resolute city officials are expected to ask
soon for a new central library, expansion of the waterfront aquarium, improvements
to parks and roads, new courts and police stations. With previously approved
bond issues and City Council votes, Seattle expects to lay out $660 million
for capital projects in the next six years, a figure that doesn't include
projects by school districts, the separately financed, and largely self-supporting
water and light departments, or the port authority. The Port of Seattle
alone, for example, has $1.6 billion of projects scheduled for the next
six years.<BR>
<BR>
King County and its neighboring counties in Puget Sound, and the State of
Washington, meanwhile, have even bigger capital plans--some slated for action,
some just a fond wish-- including a convention center expansion, two sports
stadia, a several billion dollar rapid transit system (headed for a vote
in the fall), an environmental greenway between Seattle and the Cascade
mountains to the East, and literally untold billions in freeway and bridge
construction. Statewide, transportation infrastructure needs alone have
been estimated at $20.8 billion in the next quarter century.<BR>
<BR>
It would be an exaggeration to say that voters are either fed up or exhausted
by the large construction agenda ahead, perhaps because they are only dimly
aware of how big it is. But, if voters have not shown themselves angry,
they clearly are impatient and highly selective. Part of their reluctance
is probably based on a sense that taxes at all levels are too high. Another
part is surely due to a concern that they can see no strategy or priority
evident in all this capital planning, and too little coordination among
governmental units.<BR>
<BR>
But there also could well be some frustration that the costs of these projects
are simply too high--that taxpayers are not getting their money's worth.
Past legislation meant to prevent corruption and to assure environmental
protection has contributed to delays and higher overhead costs. However,
also contributing has been the very nature of government, where typically
the group that spends the money is different from that which plans how to
spend it and is always different from those whose money is spent.<BR>
<BR>
The usual pattern (to oversimplify for the sake of brevity) is that government
decides to build, say, a prison, then hires a design team to plan it, and
then lets it out for competitive construction bids. Once the low bidder
is selected, the construction project gets underway. Soon enough, it seems,
cost over-runs are noted. More money must be found. Even some projects that
come in nominally under budget were unnecessarily expensive in the first
place. The design team, having no responsibility for balancing all elements,
including likely operating and maintenance costs, may &quot;gold plate,&quot;
or over-engineer, the design and make high price tags inevitable.<BR>
<BR>
At least, that is the charge laid against the present system by advocates
of various alternative approaches. Some are promoting privatization of construction,
wherein, say, a jail or prison will be built and managed by a private company.
Nationally, there were 88 of these secure adult facilities under construction
by the end of 1994, according the National Center for Policy Analysis. A
1991 study in Texas that found that costs for four prisons were reduced
14.4 percent by private building and management. An Australian report in
1994 found a 20 percent saving in a similar situation.<BR>
<BR>
The term &quot;design/build&quot; is used for some such projects, and &quot;design/build/operate&quot;
for ones that take the private theme still further. In the latter category
is a new project by the City of Seattle to develop a water filtration plant
along the Tolt River. But the money is still the public's and so is the
ownership. <BR>
<BR>
This brings us to a visionary approach to public projects that has been
pioneered in England, the so-called Private Initiative Project (PFI). The
PFI has changed the very concept of government's role from providing services
as an owner to procuring them as a customer. An entire project--say, a prison,
to go back to the example used before--is designed, financed, built, operated
and owned by a private concern which then, per agreement, sells its services--correctional
services, per inmate, in this case--to the government. The private concern
technically owns the project and sells services to the government, which
is spared any cash expenditure up front and pays fixed operating expenses
over a long period, such as 30 years. The government's short term role is
to decide what correctional services it wants in the first place--technically,
the values and performance standards it expects of a well-run prison, and
the risks it wants to insure against--and then to ask for worldwide bids
to design the project on that basis.<BR>
<BR>
It is in the design process that the English have found that the most money
can be saved; not because that process represents much expense itself, but
because the quality of the design determines the ultimate costs of the project
as a whole. With the full range of private sector expertise available to
companies -- and consortia of companies -- involved in bidding the project,
various cost controls, revenue streams and financing are offered to a public
authority. Then the winning team bids out the construction, also worldwide.<BR>
<BR>
The result in Britain over the past few years has been a steep increase
in Public Finance Initiative (PFI) projects, which now amount to $28 billion,
for roads, transit, prisons, hospitals, schools, libraries, government offices,
and much else. Thanks to the wide expertise available to private consortia,
their ability to integrate their work, and the freedom they enjoy as owners
to create innovative solutions, they are able to bring in projects at an
expense 20 to 30 percent lower than those of comparable public projects.<BR>
<BR>
In the past couple of months, Douglas Hogg, who heads the PFI, and Jonathan
Hugget, an associate from Vancouver, B.C. where this idea presently is being
aired, have visited Seattle to meet with a few local business and governmental
leaders who have expressed interest in the concept. The hope on all sides
is that we might be able to learn from their experiences. Britain, Canada
and the US all have differences in the way public development is governed
today. In particular, we enjoy the benefits of tax exempt bonds for public
works, which gives our public approach an advantage over almost any private
one. Nonetheless, the advantage may not be conclusive and, in any event,
the PFI concept may be adaptable to our particular circumstances.<BR>
<BR>
When a half dozen Seattle bond attorneys and public finance analysts vetted
the Public Finance Initiative idea last week, they concluded that potential
benefits definitely warrant further investigation. <BR>
<BR>
They noted that the English also might have something to teach us about
handling the politics of this form of privatization. In the UK, the Conservative
Party initiated the Public Finance Initiative and are especially pleased
that it saves money, while the Labor Party backs it because its savings
in overhead costs result in more money available for construction jobs.
The tough job initially was persuading the bureaucracy. The Brits were courageous
enough to take on that daunting challenge. Are we?<BR>

Dear Senator:


As a small business owner and taxpayer, I strongly encourage
you to support efforts to repeal the Davis-Bacon Act.  This
outdated, discriminatory act has cost hard working taxpayers
billions, and inhibited the opportunities of small
construction firms and unskilled (mostly minority) workers.

Davis-Bacon is an example of what's wrong with Washington.
This anti-market law has no place in our government, yet
lawmakers elected for change have been unable to repeal it.
I am shocked to hear that some Members of Congress actually
want to "reform" Davis-Bacon by expanding it.

When the Republicans pulled Davis-Bacon out of the budget
reconciliation bill they sent a signal to voters.  Such
activity told the public the majority party wasn't willing
to aggressively support bold regulatory and fiscal reform.
The confidence I had in Congress since the '94 election is
being eroded by the failures of this Congress to enact bold
reforms.  This failure only benefits special interests at
the expense of all taxpayers and our system of free
enterprise.

As a member of the Small Business Survival Committee, I
understand the implications of keeping a law like Davis-
Bacon on the books.  Time should have run out for Davis-
Bacon, and Members of Congress should repeal this harmful
law.

Sincerely,
</textarea>

The Issues Behind Filegate; It's Not Just a &quot;Bureaucratic Snafu&quot;</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER><I>by Bruce Chapman<BR>
<BR>
</I><IMG SRC="starbar.gif" WIDTH="390" HEIGHT="21" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" 
ALIGN="BOTTOM"> </CENTER>
</H3>
If illegal use of confidential FBI files is proven, Filegate will most resemble
that part of Watergate wherein White House zeal to dig up dirt on others
led to dirty practices--and genuine scandal.<BR>
<BR>
No one familiar with the White House pass system could believe that &quot;Project
Update&quot; was merely concerned with reviewing 407 FBI files of former
presidents' aides to see if they still merited passes. That transparently
false explanation is even more suggestive of a cover-up than the reluctance
of the White House to provide Congress with evidence of the affair. <BR>
<BR>
Who among former employees ordinarily would be entitled to a White House
pass? The answer is simple: no one. As a Deputy Assistant to President Reagan
in the mid-'80's I knew very well that the day after I left the payroll
I would merit clearance only on a visit-by-visit basis, and only then with
a current pass holding staffer to vouch for me. It did not matter if I still
knew the Secret Service guards or they remembered me. It didn't matter if
I was still in the same Administration, serving in a departmental position.
I had no right to a White House pass. If there were a few exceptions to
this rule, they were close family members and personal advisers of the incumbent
president.<BR>
<BR>
So how could Craig Livingstone, director of security for President Clinton,
pretend that he wanted to check the FBI files of employees of former Administrations
to see which ones should be given passes? Again the answer is simple, he
couldn't. His explanation is bogus. (Can't you just see old Reagan and Bush
aides given free rein to roam the West Wing, parking their wingtips in the
Roosevelt Room and schmoozing George Stephanopolous in the Mess?) Coming
from a security chief who at the time had given passes to many of his own
White House colleagues without ever putting them through an FBI clearance--a
record of delay and laxity unmatched by any previous Administration--the
whole story is offensive as well as ridiculous.<BR>
<BR>
It is far more plausible that the former employees whose private files were
ordered from the FBI were improper targets of White House opposition research.
Out of curiosity, I sent for a copy of the list to see if I was on it. I
wasn't. But there was the name of my deputy in the White House, Tony Blankley.
Why would the file of the deputy director of the Office of Planning and
Evaluation be sought and not his superior's? Could it possibly be because
Mr. Blankley had become Press Secretary to Newt Gingrich, an Administration
critic? Other people on the list are now leaders of Congressional staffs
with direct oversight on White House activities. <BR>
<BR>
Many of the names on the list, it is true, are hard to assign any obvious
purpose. Former Chief of Staff (and later Secretary of State) Jim Baker
is often cited as such a case. Yet, think: in 1993, when the list was first
collected, Baker's name was a lot more interesting, for at that time he
was talking about running for President in 1996.<BR>
<BR>
So the White House assertion that the file acquisitions was just a &quot;bureaucratic
snafu&quot; does not meet the laugh test. <BR>
<BR>
The next line of defense for Administration apologists is, &quot;So what?&quot;
After all, why should former officials worry about their past being known
unless they have something to hide?<BR>
<BR>
In truth, they have a lot to worry about, starting with the danger of anonymous
and false accusations being promoted by people in official positions. In
most arenas of life, malicious rumors can be confronted in the public forum.
We see it all the time in lawsuits and political campaigns. But compilation
of an FBI file does not take place in the open. <BR>
<BR>
An FBI background security check routinely is ordered for people under consideration
for service in the White House or for appointment to a department post that
requires confirmation by the Senate. Some lesser positions also require
FBI checks. By law, the information collected in the resulting FBI file
is confidential and meant only for review by the President, his personnel
staff and, in the case of a Senate confirmation, a few relevant senators
and their top committee aides.<BR>
<BR>
However, it is a popular misconception that FBI files necessarily are objective
and represent the FBI's own considered judgment. FBI agents seek out opinions
as well as facts, and often more from one's critics than from one's friends.
If someone accuses you of something, you don't have the right to know his
name, or, as a practical matter, the nature of the accusation. The agents
roll the whole pile--fact and possible fiction--into something that is meant
to be evaluated by the authorities making (or confirming) the appointment.
These authorities almost always behave with responsibility and common sense.<BR>
<BR>
Even so, misuse of FBI files occurs. From 1959, when President Eisenhower's
nominee for Secretary of Commerce, Admiral Lewis Strauss, was defeated on
trumped up charges, through every administration since, we have seen instances
where something that sounds like a conclusive evaluation, but isn't--&quot;an
FBI file&quot;--is leaked, and a nominee or office-holder is smeared.<BR>
<BR>
Imagine that you were under consideration for a presidential appointment
and you knew that your views might incite foes to say false or distorted
things about you to the FBI, and that you ran at least a small risk that
your file might be misued by persons unknown to prevent your appointment.
It would be a disincentive to serve, wouldn't it?<BR>
<BR>
Grim as that prospect looms, now imagine you also learned that years later,
staffers in some future White House could get a hold of your unprocessed
FBI file and make whatever public or private use of it they wanted--without
your approval or knowledge and without connection to any legitimate official
purpose. That suggests why so-called &quot;Project Update&quot; was such
a stark perversion of security procedures. <BR>
<BR>
There are, indeed, &quot;bureaucratic snafus&quot; that mitigate government
&quot;mistakes.&quot; This doesn't seem to be one of them. It looks more
like an assault on privacy and due process, and more broadly, on the trust
that supports representative democracy. It fully warrants the investigation
it is getting.<BR>

<h2>The CDC &quot;IMPACT&quot; Grant Program: Cash Cow for America's Health Charities?</h2>
<p>
For fifty years the federal government's Centers for 
Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta has been concerned with curing disease through 
research, public education, and inoculation.  But recently the CDC has shifted its 
focus from the practice of medicine and medical research to politics.  The agency now 
spends tens of millions of taxpayers' dollars 
annually <I>to train lobbyists</I> in how to enact gun 
control laws, how to ban smoking or tobacco advertising, and other politically correct 
causes championed by the political left.
<P>It is illegal to use tax dollars for partisan politics, so there are serious concerns 
about not only the propriety but also the legality 
of the CDC's political initiatives.  This report examines a major ongoing program funded 
by the CDC that in 1993 alone spent $85 million in tax dollars to initiate a program in 32 
states and the District of Columbia to train 
lobbyists and build political coalitions that will 
advocate banning tobacco products.
<P>No one today denies the health hazards of smoking.  The issue here is not whether or 
not smoking is healthy; it is whether or not prohibition is wise public policy and, more 
importantly, whether or not tax dollars ought to 
be used to promote it.  
<P>Once tax dollars are used to promote one kind of &quot;politically correct&quot; consumption 
behavior, there is in principle no end to it.  Today, smoking happens to be the 
most politically incorrect behavior, but the consumption of fast foods, alcohol, red meat, 
and myriad other products has already been attacked by various self-appointed 
national nannies.  
BR>
<I>The author, Thomas J. DiLorenzo, is a Senior Fellow with the Capital 
Research Center and a Professor of Economics at Loyola College in Baltimore.</I><BR>

<P><B>Florida Leads the Way</B>
<P>1996 marks the midterm of a five year (1993-98) program sponsored by the CDC Office 
on Smoking and Health.  In 1993 the CDC awarded an initial $85 million to 32 state health 
departments as part of its &quot;National Tobacco 
Prevention an

d Control Program,&quot; which the agency labels 
<B>I</B>nitiatives to <B>M</B>obilize for the 
<B>P</B>revention <B>A</B>nd <B>C</B>ontrol of 
<B>T</B>obacco Use (IMPACT).  IMPACT grants to state 
health departments are renewable for up to five years.  
<P>At first blush there does not seem to be anything objectionable to state health 
departments helping people  especially children  quit smoking or discouraging 
them from taking up the habit in the first place.  
But the primary emphasis of the program is not medical treatment or education but politics. 
 The essential purpose of the grants is to mobilize a &quot;comprehensive and 
coordinated nationwide effort&quot; to enact 
prohibitionist legislation through &quot;local, state, and 
regional initiatives.&quot; 
<P>The grants fall into two categories:  
&quot;planning awards&quot; for states that have not 
yet established a political coalition, and 
&quot;core awards&quot; to assist states that have 
already established the political infrastructure 
for such a coalition.  The targeted states are listed in the accompanying box.
<P>Florida is one of the states that has received significant funding 
(approximately $250,000 per year since 1993) from the 
CDC's IMPACT program.  Because Florida is essentially a role model for what the CDC hopes 
to achieve in the other 31 states and the District of Columbia, it will be the focus of this report.  
<P>In its initial 1993 grant proposal to the CDC, the Florida Department of Health and 
Rehabilitative Services (FDHRS) &quot;project 
director,&quot; Mr. Joyner Sims, explained that 
the <HR>


 meetings,&quot; &quot;meeting room costs,&quot; the printing 
of a semi-annual coalition newsletter, and 
&quot;mini grants&quot; to local political coalitions 
throughout the state.
<P>The proposal also describes the precise role of the tax-funded Tobacco Free 
Florida Coalition.  The Coalition will &quot;Provide 
advocacy&quot; for &quot;tobacco prevention and 
control legislation,&quot; &quot;develop new legislation 
specifically targeting restrictions on outdoor 
advertising,<B>&quot; </B>and create<B> </B>a political 
&quot;training and technical assistance plan&quot; to 
provide &quot;coordinated support&quot; for lobbyists.  It 
will fund the travel of its members to political training conferences and establish &quot;a 
linkage with the Florida Association of Broadcasters.&quot;
<P>The Coalition will also seek to change Medicaid so that it covers &quot;tobacco 
cessation services&quot; that are provided by the 
health charities, among others.  This last policy objective would funnel millions of tax 
dollars to the major health charities.  Why should government subsidize smoking 
cessation when most smokers who quit (35 million 
by some estimates) do so on their own?
<P>Taxpayers' funds will also help finance the Coalition's participation in SCARCNet, 
an on-line communication network used by anti-smoking political activists that &quot;allows 
state officials to coordinate with CDC officials 
in countering major tobacco industry announcements.&quot;
<P>Florida's CDC grant application also makes clear the role of the major health charities 
 the ACS, American Heart Association (AHA), and American Lung 
Association (ALA)  and the political nature of the <HR>
<BR>
<B>For decades the political Left has used children as an 
excuse to enact public policies whose major effects are on adults. <HR>
</B><BR>
money would be spent mobilizing a &quot;Tobacco Free Florida Coalition.&quot;  At the 
time, this political coalition was known as 
&quot;The American Cancer Society's Lung Cancer 
Task Force,&quot; indicating that the apparent 
purpose of the grant was to use taxpayers' dollars 
to fund this ACS program.  The grant paid the salary for a &quot;Tobacco Free Florida 
Coalition Coordinator,&quot; a position that &quot;is located 
at the American Cancer Society (ACS) in Tampa, Florida,&quot; according to the grant contract.  
<P>Thus, even though the ACS has long denied receiving government funding of 
any kind (why should individuals donate if their tax dollars are already supporting the 
organization?), it does receive federal tax 
dollars that are filtered through the Florida 
health agency and, in all likelihood, through 
dozens of other state health departments as well.   
<P>In its application to the CDC, the FDHRS indicated that it intended to fill certain 
political &quot;gaps&quot; in the state, including the lack 
of a comprehensive statewide political coalition, limited funding for local 
coalition-building, local coalitions needing more direction 
in &quot;cultural diversity,&quot; and inadequate 
state government staff to help build political coalitions.
<P>If it received the CDC grant, the FDHRS promised to use its federal tax dollars to 
lobby for the following policies:
<P> Local ordinances that would ban smoking in the workplace;
<P> Educational campaigns for lawmakers;
<P> Bans on cigarette vending machines;
<P> Restrictions on tobacco products advertising;
<P> Tobacco excise tax increases, with some of the revenues earmarked for members of 
the Tobacco Free Florida Coalition
<P> Banning promotional give-aways of tobacco products
<P> Banning the sale of cigarettes by pharmacies; and
<P> Raising the legal smoking age to 21.
<P>The CDC grant would pay at least part of the salaries of Florida Health 
Department employees, American Cancer Society 
staff, and newly-hired political activists and consultants.  It also covers &quot;travel expenses 
for coalition members to attend quarterly
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->

IMPACT grant program in a table that lists Coalition personnel.  It shows that the 
health charities are effectively receiving 
taxpayers' dollars as Coalition members, and that 
arguably they are engaged in illegal, tax-funded political advocacy.  The FDHRS grant 
application lists the members of the Coalition and describes their roles (see box).
<P>The list of coalition members also includes medical professionals, but in virtually 
every instance their role is listed as liaison to 
fellow professionals, i.e., as political operatives.  
<P>
<P><B>The Role of the Robert Wood 
<P>Johnson Foundation</B>
<P>The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) in Princeton, New Jersey 
complements the CDC's political activities.  The Foundation was founded in 1972 and is 
the largest private foundation in the U.S. devoted exclusively to health care issues.  
Its assets approach $4 billion and its major 
health policy initiatives are almost exclusively 
aimed at drastically increasing the amount of government intervention in health care.
<P>Lawsuits filed against Hillary Rodham Clinton's secret health care task force 
have forced disclosure of the powerful influence RWJF exerted over the 
promotion of the Clinton administration's failed attempt at a government takeover 
of health care in 1993 and 1994.

In addition, RWJF's &quot;State Initiatives in Health Care Reform&quot; program put millions 
of dollars behind political lobbying efforts to pass state-level health care laws that 
contain such Clinton plan features as price 
controls, mandated managed care, &quot;community 
rating&quot; of health insurance, and massive regulation of health care markets.  Florida, 
Minnesota, and Washington passed legislation favored by the Foundation.  As 
Genevieve Young, an attorney specializing in 
health law, has argued in past issues of 
<I>Organization Trends</I>, these laws enable state 
officials to circumvent a U.S. Congress that is 
unwilling to do what the Administration and RWJF know is best.
<P>RWJF now wants to use these methods in the anti-smoking crusade.  In Florida and 
in twenty other states, RWJF is supplementing CDC taxpayer funding with its own 
&quot;Smokeless States&quot; grant program.   A brochure 
on the program indicates that the Foundation &quot;will make new grants to up to 21 
statewide coalitions working in partnership with 
community groups.&quot; RWJF plans to spend $20 million on the program over the next 
four years.
<P>To qualify for the RWJF grants, as Florida has, a state or nonprofit entity must 
demonstrate the existence of a &quot;strong, 
broad-based state-wide coalition,&quot; a &quot;state 
government commitment to the effort including 
support <BR>
Alaska, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, 
Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, 
North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah<BR>
from the governor, key legislators, and other public officials,&quot; and &quot;recent or 
proposed local and state policy and financing 
changes&quot; designed to achieve tobacco prohibition. 
 Despite occasional protests that they are not &quot;prohibitionists,&quot; prohibition is what 
RWJF and the health charities want.  What else, 
after all, can &quot;Smokeless States&quot; mean?
<P>In Florida, RWJF provides in-kind as well as financial support:  A FDHRS 
&quot;progress report&quot; to the CDC this year observes, 
&quot;The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Advocacy Coordinators are assisting the 
[CDC] funded tobacco coalitions.&quot;  These 
&quot;advocacy coordinators&quot; organize media 
campaigns, conduct opinion polls, and train citizens in political advocacy.  The RWJF 
grant also is used in Florida to bring in 
&quot;nationally recognized experts in the tobacco 
control movement.&quot;  These efforts are 
consistent with the RWJF's record of attempting to &quot;solve&quot; public health problems with 
more government bureaucracy, regulation, and taxes.  
<P>
<P><B>Using Children as Political Pawns</B>
<P>For decades the political Left has used children as an excuse to enact public 
policies whose major effects are on adults.  The Children's Defense Fund, for example, 
spends virtually all its resources lobbying for an expanded welfare state.  But its name is 
useful when it chooses to attack critics of failed welfare state programs as &quot;anti-children.&quot;  
<P>The CDC and RWJF have adopted this strategy.  Even though most of their 
policy recommendations, such as higher excise 
taxes, affect everyone, they are careful to 
highlight <HR>
<BR>
<B>Is not something unsavory occurring when officials of 
the Florida Department of Education pay other peoples' children 
to entrap hard-working, tax-paying citizens?</B><BR>

<B>Organization</B>Trends<BR>
CDC &quot;IMPACT&quot;
<P><I>(continued from page 3)</I><BR>
 taxpayer funds are spent on public education programs, the 
lion's share goes toward tax-funded politics.  
From September 1993 to May 1994 the FDHRS boasted that it lobbied for a $1.00 increase 
in the state's tobacco products tax, working closely with the AHA lobbyist Scott Ballin. 
 This effort was unsuccessful.
<P>Florida could report success with the sting operations conducted by &quot;underage 
operatives who are observed by a special enforcement agent.&quot;  These resulted in the 
entrapment and citation of hundreds of convenience store clerks; dozens of 
businesses were subject to &quot;administrative actions&quot; 
that were taken against their business licenses; and a &quot;total of $136,000 in fees were 
collected for the Department of Education.&quot;
<P>Is not something unsavory occurring when officials of the Florida Department of 
Education pay other peoples' children to entrap hard-working, tax-paying citizens?  
Are Florida's law enforcement resources appropriately spent arresting clerks who sell 
cigarettes to teenagers?  Is criminalizing 
behavior the best way to advance public health?  
<P>Perhaps the most important political &quot;progress&quot; that Florida reported to the 
CDC is the news that the Tobacco Free Florida Coalition helped lobby for a new state law, 
SB 2110, which was enacted on May 25, 1994.  It allows the state to sue the tobacco 
industry to recover health care costs from tobacco-related illnesses incurred by Medicaid 
recipients.  Florida becomes one of fourteen 
states, as of this writing, pursuing this legal 
strategy and arguing that tobacco companies 
should be liable for the negative health effects 
of their product even if smokers know full well  as they undoubtedly do  that 
smoking increases health risks.

are encouraged (and sometimes paid) to join the Student Coalition Against Tobacco (SCAT). 
 A SCAT campaign involves students in a wide range of activities that organizers 
say are &quot;considered youth political advocacy, which is at the very base of

CDC's national coalition-building campaign even though some California law 
enforcement officials have criticized it as &quot;vigilantism.&quot;

for Anti-Smoking Dollars</B>

its grants.  Florida's reports for 1993-95 show that although some<BR>

<P>The logic of this argument, if it is accepted by the courts, is likely to have 
far-reaching effects.  It is not hard to imagine that 
plaintiffs' lawyers will file similar class-action 
lawsuits against the alcoholic beverage industry, the fast food business, and many 
other industries.  Overeating, overdrinking, even overexercizing can be hazardous to health.  
If courts reject the principle that adults are responsible for their own consumption 
behavior, the resulting liability crisis will 
rival the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.
<P>The federal government's National Cancer Institute (NCI) has joined with the CDC 
to fulfill this promise.  NCI grant # CA-94-15 (obtained through a Freedom of 
Information Act request) provided $1,119,678 to 
Northeastern University Law School in Boston in 1995 for a four-year legal research project. 
 The project will &quot;produce policy papers&quot; 
on `states' ability to sue tobacco companies for the medical expenditures caused by 
tobacco-related diseases&quot; and paid by Medicaid.  
The grantees  university law professors and their students  will also research &quot;the 
optimal design and constitutional validity of state legislation that would strengthen 
legal procedures for obtaining such reimbursement of health care costs from the 
tobacco industry.&quot;  Additional government 
funding for the project is provided by the 
Massachusetts Department of Public Health 
($324,500 annually) and the Americans With 
Disabilities Act ($284,804).
<P>The plaintiffs lawyers who take such cases on behalf of state governments can 
well afford their own legal research, especially since they stand to earn hundreds of 
millions of dollars in contingency fees.  It is likely 
that they will benefit more than any tobacco smoker, courtesy of NCI and other 
government agencies.  
<P>Florida reports one final bit of 
&quot;progress&quot; to the CDC.  The Coalition intends to 
use federal tax dollars to &quot;actively support 
employee litigation against employers who fail to implement meaningful smoking policies.&quot; 
 FDHRS recently recruited an attorney who will help employees harass their 
employers who fail to enact politically correct 
anti-smok<BR>
ing policies along the lines suggested by the state coalition.  
<P>
<P><B>Resurrecting Alcohol Prohibition</B>
<P>The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation recently announced a new four year, 
$10.2 million grant program that follows the same format as its &quot;Tobacco Free States&quot; 
grant program.  The new program will fund statewide political coalitions as well as local 
coalitions to encourage alcohol prohibition.  Like the anti-smoking programs, this one 
contains plenty of rhetoric about children.  Indeed, the program's name is &quot;Reducing 
Underage Drinking Through Community and State Coalitions.&quot;  But the public 
policies highlighted in its brochure affect 
<I>everyone</I>  legal as well as underage drinkers.
<P>For example, among government interventions &quot;shown to be effective&quot; are 
&quot;restrictions on the distribution of alcohol&quot; 
through state government monopoly liquor stores, regulatory limits on &quot;outlet density,&quot; and 
the elimination of advertising.  Perhaps because State liquor monopolies charge higher 
prices than private, competitive liquor stores, 
the Foundation considers them a positive benefit to adult purchasers of liquor.  
Similarly, limits on competitive advertising are sure 
to lead to higher liquor prices.  But won't limits on &quot;outlet density&quot; increase accidents 
as purchasers drive further away to drink?    
<P>Another &quot;effective&quot; intervention, 
according to RWJF, is &quot;increases in taxes and 
the relative price of alcoholic beverages.&quot;  
This, too, is proposed for the sake of children, 
even though sales to minors are already illegal.  Increased taxes and the other proposed 
laws and regulations apply to all liquor sales.   RWJF literature says nothing about 
parental responsibility. 
<P>The last paragraph of the RWJF grant announcement offers this disclaimer:  
&quot;Grant funds may not be used ... for lobbying 
or otherwise attempting to influence legislation.&quot;  This statement cannot be accepted 
at face value when the primary purpose of the program is to fund statewide coalitions 
<I>of lobbyists</I> whose mission is to enact 
prohibitionist policies.  Grantees are &quot;expected 
to mobilize existing or new statewide or local coalitions&quot; to enact higher alcohol 
excise taxes and other legislated restrictions on alcohol consumption.   Among the 
&quot;selection criteria&quot; for the grants is the 
&quot;<I>political feasibility</I>&quot; of the state's project (emphasis added).
<P>The RWJF brochure claims its prohibitionist policy proposals are &quot;seen as the 
most successful approaches.&quot;  Perhaps this is 
why it has allocated $10.2 million to finance such campaigns in twelve states.  
<P>
<P><B>Conclusions</B>
<P>It is illegal to spend tax funds on partisan political activity.  Yet this is what the CDC 
is doing when it allocates hundreds of millions of tax dollars for anti-smoking coalition 
building.  These amounts are comparable to the amount spent on congressional campaigns. 
 Similarly, individuals and organizations that contribute to candidates cannot deduct 
their contributions from their taxes.  But a tax-exempt foundation like the Robert 
Wood Johnson Foundation spends millions of dollars constructing a &quot;political 
infrastructure&quot; for assorted prohibitionist movements 
in dozens of states.
<P>Self-interest reinforces ideology in the actions of the major health charities  the 
ACS, AHA, and ALA.  As documented in this study and in my book, 
<I>Unhealthy Charities</I> (Basic Books, 1994), with James T. 
Bennett, health charities receive federal 
government funds to build political coalitions.  They, 
in turn, lobby state legislatures to require educational programs for adults and children 
to be administered by   none other than the health charities themselves.  
<P>The CDC's reputation is built on its work in health research, education, and 
disease innoculation.  By undertaking to finance 
lobbying campaigns sponsored by various tax-exempt organizations, it is denying 
Americans the right to make their own decisions with regard to personal behaviors that 
have been deemed politically-incorrect.  And it is diverting millions of dollars from 
important disease research.  This abuse of 
taxpayers' dollars should be stopped.

<P><B>Briefly</B>Noted<BR>
In response to the increasing practice on the part of some large foundations, including the ROBERT WOOD 
JOHNSON FOUNDATION, of using grant monies to &quot;leverage&quot; public funds, the Pennsylvania General Assembly is considering a 
measure that would sharply curtail the ability of state agencies to solicit or receive funding from nonprofit foundations.  More details to 
be provided in future issues.

<P>Liberal intellectuals and labor leaders are attempting to revive the old alliance between organized labor and &quot;progressive&quot; academia. 
 Recently, a series of &quot;teach-ins&quot;  modeled on the anti-war conferences of the Vietnam era  have been held at various 
campuses around the country as a means of inspiring students and professors to devote more of their energy toward helping the union agenda. 
 At a Columbia University event, AFL-CIO President John Sweeney declared, &quot;We need your help in telling millions of 
unrepresented workers that while it takes a village to raise a child, it takes a union to get a raise.&quot;

<P>The CENTER FOR EQUAL OPPORTUNITY in Washington has published a new monograph entitled 
<I>Race and the Criminal Justice System:  How Race Affects Jury 
Trials</I>.  It includes a series of essays that debate whether race continues to skew justice in 
the courtroom and what role, if any, race should play in jury selection.  Contributors include Walter Berns, Joan Biskupic, 
Randall Kennedy and Jeffrey Rosen.  The final essay by Robert Lerner suggests, contrary to conventional wisdom, that blacks are 
actually more likely than whites to be acquitted in jury trials for most felonies.  Contact the Center:  202-639-0803 / www.ceousa.org
<P>
<P>During the recent presidential campaign, press reports revealed that the Clinton administration exploited a Justice 
Department program called &quot;Citizenship USA&quot; (designed to accelerate the naturalization process for new citizens) in order to register 
hordes of new Democratic voters before election day.  Further reports show that the White House gave most of the Citizenship USA 
work to liberal &quot;community advocacy groups&quot; like the UNITED NEIGHBORHOOD ORGANIZATION, which has close ties to both 
the President and Mrs. Clinton.
<P>
<P>A &quot;third wave&quot; of free market think tanks has begun to emerge.  Following the rise of Washington and state-based policy 
groups (the first and second waves respectively), the ALLEGHENY INSTITUTE in Pittsburgh is blazing the way for a new generation 
of market-oriented groups that will focus on local issues.  The Institute's executive director, Gerry Bowyer, writing in The 
Heritage Foundation's <I>Insider</I> newsletter, reports that the new group is working to restructure the government of Allegheny 
County, Pennsylvania, focusing on privatization efforts (including privatization of an airport and property assessments) and deregulation.

<P><I>Z Magazine</I>, the entertaining publication for the unreconstructed leftist, is in trouble.  An urgent appeal warns that 
&quot;various circumstances&quot;  including the fact that Z hadn't filed IRS forms for four years  have put the brash magazine  
&quot;publication home&quot; of such notables as Noam Chomsky, Barbara Ehrenreich, and Sara Diamond  in a precarious situation.  
Emergency appeal donations may be sent to 18 Millfield Street, Woods Hole, MA  02543.

<P>Drugs and Welfare:  Billionaire financier George Soros, prime benefactor of the drug legalization movement, plans to give 
$50 million to immigration rights organizations across the country.  He is doing so in response to the welfare reform legislation 
enacted earlier this year, which Soros believes to be unjust and part of a &quot;mean-spirited attack on immigrants.&quot;  The funds will be 
dispersed through his newest charitable foundation, the EMMA LAZARUS FUND.  
<P>
<P>Can't we just get along:  In a full-page ad in the 
<I>Nation</I> magazine, five environmental groups (Earthtrust, Endangered 
Species Project, Friends of Animals, Marine Mammal Fund, and Sea Shepherds Conservation Society) attack GREENPEACE 
for supporting what they call the &quot;Dolphin Death Bill,&quot; which they claim weakens the U.S. dolphin protection law.  The groups 
accuse Greenpeace of being AWOL in the tuna/dolphin battle while &quot;mailing millions of letters appealing to the public to `save the dolphins.'&quot; 
 Thousands of dolphins will die, they say, because Greenpeace acts &quot;hypocritically.&quot;  For our part, we've always been 
more concerned about the neglected rights of the tuna.<HR>

</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Current welfare debate revolves almost exclusively around the
question of how to motivate young women to get off, or stay off, the dole.
Completely ignored are the young men in their lives, except as they are
identified as candidates for child support. Yet establishing the conditions
that will encourage young men to marry the women who bear their children-and
for young women to accept them as husbands-is the central challenge of social
policy today, according to Discovery Senior Fellow George Gilder.<BR>
<BR>
Current laws and regulations are biased against family formation and have
created a blighted underclass, Gilder says. However, even today's reformers
continue to think the problem is simply one of impelling young mothers to
forgo child-bearing or to get a job if they already have children.<BR>
Fortunately, Gilder's view is about to re-enter the debate through publication
of a revised version of <I>Visible Man, </I>his 1978 book edited by Midge
Decter. The book<I> </I>tells the true story of Sam, a black youth of the
Albany ghetto, and the women in his disconnected life. In a tribute to Ralph
Ellison's classic <I>Invisible Man</I>, Gilder portrays the Sams-the <I>Visible
Men</I> of the American inner city - as the all-too conspicuous victims
of government policy, as well as the frequent victimizers of society. Black
males' income is actually below that of black females', so is educational
attainment, and black males are the only demographic group in American to
suffer a declining life expectancy rate in 1994.<BR>
<BR>
The problem, Gilder insists, is not racism, but a failure of government
policy at all levels to reward family life and to discourage deviations
from it.<BR>
The tragedy of Sam is compounded by the passage of time, Gilder notes in
his new introduction to the book. A young man with several illegitimate
offspring when he appears in <I>Visible Man</I>, Sam is now, 17 years later
most likely a grandfather.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Visible Man, </I>billed as a &quot;true story of post-racist America,&quot;
originally sold only 800 copies, though it has become a kind of cult book
for close Gilder readers. Its insights helped inform Gilder's following
book, <I>Wealth and </I>Poverty, which became a world-wide best seller (500,000
copies) and, in revised form, is still in print from ICS Press. (Copies
are available through Discovery's office.)<BR>
This spring Discovery plans to co-publish <I>Visible Man </I>with ICS Press,
placing the original Sam in the context of all that has been learned-and
all that politicians, academics, journalists and philanthropists have failed
to learn-since the first version. </BLOCKQUOTE>

CALLED &quot;A MUST READ&quot;</CENTER>
</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If members of Congress are not already up to their armpits in
alligators, they soon will be (along with California gnatcatchers, spotted
owls and burying beetles), for the Endangered Species Act (the ESA) is coming
up for the first serious review since the controversial bill was passed
a generation ago. And suddenly gliding deep into the political maelstrom
is <I>Noah's Choice: The </I>Future of Endangered Species (Knopf, N. Y.),
the powerful new book by Discovery Senior Fellow Mark L. Plummer and Charles
C. Mann.<BR>
<BR>
Publication date is February 25, but the book already is attracting eager
interest. &quot;Must read&quot; is the pre-publication judgment of the <I>Kirkus
Review</I>, a journal used by bookstore owners and newspapers assignment
editors, while <I>Publisher's Weekly</I> calls the book &quot;timely, provocative
and reasonable.&quot; Sen. Slade Gorton, who read the book immediately after
his re-election campaign and is a leader on the endangered species debate
nationally, says<I> Noah's </I>Choice is &quot;written with the drama and
emotional impact of a novel. It will make a wonderful contribution to the
debate over how best to steward our natural heritage,&quot; he wrote for
a dust jacket endorsement. &quot;It shows, compassionately and wisely, how
we should weigh values when none can be met in their entirety.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Word apparently is travelling, because other Congressional offices and journalists
have begun asking for advance copies of the book. An article derived in
part from the book graces the cover of the current <I>Audubon</I> magazine,
and other pieces will appear shortly in <I>Science</I> and <I>The Atlantic
</I>Monthly. Discovery Institute and the publishers, Alfred A. Knopf, New
York, will introduce the book in Washington at a press conference and reception,
tentatively scheduled for February 28. A later book party will be held in
Seattle, and the two authors will make appearances in various other cities.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Noah's Choice</I> has been in preparation for three years, with research
taking the authors coast to coast, from limestone caves to sand dunes. During
the last year and a half Discovery Institute has built several conferences,
seminars and dinner forums around the endangered species topic, with attendees
ranging from members of Friends of the Earth to the Wise Use movement, with
government and industry representation as well. Besides Mark Plummer, participating
Discovery Fellows have included former Congressman John R. Miller, whose
<I>Policy Review </I>article on the topic has been widely disseminated,
and Albert Gidari, Jr., author of several scholarly legal monographs on
the constitutional difficulties of the ESA. (See article in box.)<BR>
<BR>
One reason for the broad appeal of <I>Noah's Choice</I> is its manifestly
even-handed account of endangered species and of human beings forced to
deal with the consequences of the draconian Endangered Species Act. More
controversial are sure to be the book's stern prescriptions, which entail
a major rewriting of the act - to share the burden of conservation more
equitably between individual land owners and society at large and to shift
the law's focus from punitive legal sanctions to voluntary incentives.<BR>
<BR>
Nobel prize winning economist Robert M. Solow of M.I.T., reviewing the book,
praised it as &quot;knowledgable, thoughtful and sympathetic.&quot; He expressed
hope that &quot;it may help keep rationality from becoming an endangered
species too.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Plummer and Mann collaborated on an earlier book, <I>Aspirin Wars</I>, and
have been personal freinds since a childhood shared in Bellevue, WA. Mann,
a contributing editor of <I>The Atlantic</I>, now lives in Western Massachusetts,
while Plummer resides in Seattle. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<CENTER><B>COMMEMORATING ANNIVERSARY OF CLINTON TAX ADMISSION
<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
<B>WASHINGTON, D.C. </B>--  President Clinton returned to Houston,
Texas, today approaching the one year anniversary of his repentant
statement about the 1993 tax hike:<BR>
<P>
<B>&quot;Probably there are people in this room, still mad at
me at that budget because you think I raised your taxes too much.
 It might surprise you to know that I think I raised them too
much too.&quot; -- Bill Clinton, at a Houston fund-raiser, October
17, 1995.<BR>
</B>
<P>
Bill Clinton first claimed he was a tax cutter.  Then he launched
the single largest tax increase in American history, $265 billion.
 He said he would cut taxes on the middle-class.  Instead, he
hit middle-class small business owners with a punishing tax increase.
<BR>
<P>
&quot;Bill Clinton is a proven tax-cut dodger,&quot; said Karen
Kerrigan, President, Small Business Survival Committee, a Washington,
D.C.-based small business advocacy organization.  &quot;In 1992,
he convinced American taxpayers that he's a tax cutter.  He told
them that he is their friend and with him at the helm of government
economic relief would be arriving in the form of a tax cut.  After
he got in office, he felt our pain by delivering a body blow to
the American taxpayer in the form of a $265 billion tax increase.
 The largest tax increase in history and one that bludgeoned small
businesses!&quot;<BR>
<P>
Bill Clinton now wants us to believe that he won't raise taxes
in a second term.  He told CBS's <I>60</I> <I>Minutes</I>, &quot;I'm
willing to pledge right now that I, I have no intention of raising
taxes.&quot;  (8/18/96)<BR>
<P>
In 1992 Bill Clinton's intention was to cut taxes.  Now his intention
is not to raise them.  Bill Clinton reminded us all that &quot;Fool
me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.&quot;  (10/28/92).
 Bill Clinton is a tax and spend liberal.  In his second term
he will raise taxes.  If the American taxpayer liked Clinton's
&quot;middle-class tax relief,&quot; they'll love his &quot;targeted
tax cuts.&quot;  Certainly small businesses won't be fooled by
more election-year promises by a proven tax hiker.
<P>
   
<P>
Back in Houston, President Clinton needs to be reminded that once
he was right.  &quot;I raised [taxes] too much...&quot;<BR>
<BR>

    <TITLE>Curbin America's Appetite for Lawsuits</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<B>From the Friday, December 8, 1995, <I>Seattle Post-Intelligencer:</I></B>
<H1><CENTER><BR>
It's time to curb America's appetite for lawsuits</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER>by <BR>
<I>Bruce Chapman<BR>
<BR>
</I><A HREF="katz.html">[Read Roberta Katz's remarks on reform of the adversarial
legal system]</A></CENTER>
</H3>
<HR>A woman at McDonald's spills hot coffee in her lap and a jury awards
her $2.7 million. Another jury awards a man $4 million from BMW because
he wasn't told that his new car had received a minor paint touch-up before
he bought it. Yet another man is awarded $12.3 million, most of it in &quot;punitive&quot;
damages,&quot; because he fractured his neck on a Slip 'n Slide lawn toy
whose wrapper, he charges, did not warn him adequately that adults could
get hurt playing with such a thing. (It just shows that we must keep toys
out of the hands of grown ups.)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Winning the lawsuit sweepstakes in today's America is a lot easier than
winning the lottery, and while news of enormous legal awards arouse amazement
and anger in most of us, it evidently incites a drooling appetite to sue
in the rest. No wonder we now have 14 million lawsuits a year, one for every
17 Americans.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The western district of Los Angeles alone has more lawyers than all of Japan.
California as a whole is definitely a Golden State for trial lawyers; 99
of 100 auto accidents, including fender benders, result in lawsuits. Overall,
Americans' chance of being in a suit is now three times that of Canadians.
And it isn't just big businesses that gets hit, but also mom and pop stores,
charitable groups and local governments--anyone, however remotely connected
to a problem, with &quot;deep pockets&quot; that can be invaded when the
real source of a grievance is poor.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
When lawsuits hit the jackpot, who do you think benefits almost as much
as the alleged victim (who gets an average of 43 percent of awards)? That's
right, the lawyers get about 33 percent, and the rest goes to administrative
and other costs. Top corporate lawyers in America do very well in life,
but the top trial lawyers eclipse them, some raking in $15-$90 million a
year, a recent review inForbes magazine shows. Especially well-rewarded
are those who figure out how to get a parade of new clients to sue the same
company for the same problem over and over and to get &quot;punitive damages&quot;
each time in order to &quot;send a message&quot;--a message that sometimes
reads &quot;bankruptcy.&quot; Juries are not allowed to learn about this
tactic, or they would rebel more often.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And who, in addition to the manufacturer or store owner, pays? Right again:
you do--in higher insurance premiums, higher consumer prices and lowered
stock values in your personal or pension portfolio. Even though some of
the most outrageous suits are later reduced by judges, the whole litigious
system in this country, according to a study by the management consulting
firm of Tillinghast/ Perrin Towers, is freighting our economy with a burden
$140 billion annually. That is money that otherwise could create new jobs,
raise pay and productivity.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Before the trial attorneys and the professional &quot;consumer advocates&quot;
they so often support race to their word processors to protest my bias (or
maybe start a class action suit!) let it readily be acknowledged that businesses
and ordinary citizens do sometimes commit terrible blunders that harm others,
and that &quot;tort law&quot; is an entirely proper corrective. Lawsuits
often have forced negligent companies, doctors and other entities and individuals
to accept proper financial responsibilities and to improve safety standards.
Even the &quot;contingency fee&quot; arrangement that assures a plaintiff
that he will not pay the lawyer unless he wins the case can be defended
on the basis that it allows poor people access to justice in a system that
favors wealth.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The problem, however, is that the system has slowly gone nearly out of control
and has become counterproductive. Trial attorneys' jaundiced eyes and wily
ways may have motivated some otherwise indifferent firms to act more responsibly,
but at least as often the fear of legal action reaches a point where companies
are driven out of business by ruthless legal speculators. Doctors stop entering
certain fields that have become overly attractive to lawsuits. In some states,
people who might otherwise be good Samaritans when confronted by a person
in distress, instead refuse to help because of a wholly rational fear of
being sued. Another example of the chilling effect of over-litigation is
the growing trend among employers to avoid giving objective references for
former employee because they know that certain trial attorneys' latest speculative
field is &quot;wrongful termination&quot; (cases doubled between 1991 and
1994). The result is that many employers are wary of new hiring altogether.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Recognition of these consequences of over-litigation has finally created
a backlash. This year alone some 20 states have passed tort reforms. A study
by the National Bureau of Economic Research shows considerable stimulus
of economic growth in those states where tort reforms have been enacted,
and a drag on the economies of states where lawsuits hobble enterprise,
and that kind of study will fuel still more reform. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Nationally, trial attorneys are used to calling the shots in Washington,
D.C. , perhaps because they are generous campaign contributors, last year,
for example, donating $14 million. But they are conspicuously apprehensive
that Congress might pass serious tort reform legislation in this session;
indeed, in the next few weeks. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives,
led by Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, passed a fairly broad bill, including
caps on punitive damages and much-needed malpractice limitations. But the
Senate, where floor-leader Slade Gorton of Washington feared that too narrow
a victory would invite a Presidential veto, came up with a much more limited
reform bill that mainly covers product liability. (Another bill to limit
frivolous class action suits by supposedly aggrieved stockholders disappointed
at the failure of managers to anticipate stock price fluctuations seems
to be coasting to a surprisingly easy victory and Presidential signature.)
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But, while the trial attorney lobby believed that House-Senate differences
were too great to allow any bill to pass this year, the two houses' &quot;Conference
Committee&quot; suddenly appears close to a resolution. Reform-minded senators
now think that their present veto-proof majority might be willing to accept
certain obviously reasonable aspects of the House bill--for example, a financial
limit on civil actions that don't involve physical injury or suffering,
and a limit on actions taken against non-profit organizations and local
governments.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If Congress passes any tort reform bill this session, the cause of major
reform will not be drained of energy, as some reformers fear, but reinvigorated.
A public appetite for suing one another took us down the present path, and
an appetite for restoration of a more civil society can now be stimulated
through the steady introduction of successive and successful steps toward
the thorough overhaul our system really needs. Legal utopianism paradoxically
diminishes the very justice it claims to seek. We have another, better tradition,
and that is common sense. It has a much better record of achieving justice
in this all too imperfect world.<BR>

Dear Senator:

It would be a big mistake to vote for an increase in the 
minimum wage.  A minimum wage hike will hurt the economy 
and cost jobs.

Economists have found that minimum wage increases cost jobs.
Hiking the minimum wage will keep many young people, 
especially minorities and unskilled workers, out of job 
opportunities.  The drive to raise the minimum wage is 
largely politically-motivated and driven.  But many people 
fail to see the destructiveness of minimum wage increases. 
As a small business owner, I know how difficult it is to 
absorb the costs of unfunded mandates like the minimum wage.

The minimum wage is a starting wage, it's a good way for the 
entry-level employees to gain employment experience.  
Studies show that 63% of minimum wage workers earn higher 
wages within a year.  Small businesses are able to determine 
wage scales much better than Congressmen or bureaucrats.

With the implementation of welfare reform, there will be 
many low skilled people looking for jobs -- it will be much 
harder for these Americans to find employment if Congress 
raises the minimum wage.

Now is definitely not the time to raise the minimum wage.  
Leave wage increases for minimum wage workers to the 
employers, not politicians.

Sincerely,
</textarea>

 <P>
<B>August 1996</B>
<P>
<DD>Liberals no longer call themselves liberals; they prefer to be known 
as &quot;moderates.&quot;  Now a recently established California foundation has come 
up with a fresh way to market discredited liberal ideas of munificent government.  The 
California Wellness Foundation (CWF) is using the expansive concept of &quot;wellness&quot; to 
advance a broad-based policy agenda that is hostile 
to individual liberty and responsibility.
<DD>Created by the privatization of a major nonprofit Health Maintenance 
Organization (HMO), the foundation is emerging as 
a grantmaking behemoth.  With a multi-million dollar budget and nearly a billion dollars 
in assets, it has already become a major player in the nation's largest state.
<DD>CWF has taken on a cornucopia of concerns: gun ownership, smoking, 
consumption of alcoholic beverages, teenage pregnancy, to name a few.  In FY 1994-95 
CWF awarded 129 grants totaling nearly $40 million to institutions, organizations and 
individuals to tackle these and other issues that 
constitute what CWF has defined as 
&quot;prevention&quot; and &quot;wellness.&quot;
<DD>Wellness is the latest buzz-phrase among hip grantmakers.  Sufficiently vague, this 
all-encompassing term appeals to foundation professionals who believe that specific 
missions and mandates hinder their creative grantmaking talents.  Like the &quot;general 
welfare&quot; clause of the Constitution, wellness provides the imaginative foundation 
officer with limitless possibilities.
<DD>CWF's stated goal is &quot;to improve the 
health of the residents of California&quot; and 
&quot;foster healthful lifestyles, behaviors, and values.&quot; 
 To CWF, health or illness is defined not as the absence or presence of disease, &quot;but by a complex web of conditions in [the] physical and social environment,&quot; and CWF has determined its grantmaking must address &quot;the multiple barriers to healthful living from personal behavior to social and 
economic influences such as poverty, unemployment, inadequate schools and racism.&quot;  In other words, wellness means whatever CWF wants it to mean.  Sound familiar?  Such a program is simply an updated version of the root-causes rationale used to justify the 1960s War on Poverty.  
<DD>Grants are awarded in five program areas: Community Health; Population 
Health; Worksite Health Improvement; Violence Prevention; and Teenage Pregnancy and 
Birth Prevention.  Each of these creates a theater 
of operation for government intervention.  CWF's first project, the Violence 
Prevention Initiative, is fully developed and being 
expanded.  The ominous-sounding Teenage Pregnancy and Birth Prevention Initiative 
is still in the formative state.<P> 
<CENTER>* * * * *</CENTER>
<P>
<DD>Although a grantmaking foundation obligated to foster a public charitable 
interest, CWF is a recent offspring of a 
commercial enterprise.  CWF's &quot;parent&quot; is Health 
Net, the second largest health maintenance organization (HMO) in California, with 1.3 
million commercial and Medicare HMO members, many of them subscribers with CalPERS 
(the state Public Employees Retirement System).  CWF benefits from the considerable 
cachet associated with its parent's former status as a nonprofit insurer.
<DD>In 1990 the previously nonprofit Health Net became a for-profit  corporation.  
Because California law requires nonprofits that privatize to leave their assets in the 
nonprofit sector, Health Net created CWF in 1991, funding it in 1992 to the tune of $300 
million ($75 million cash, $225 million in a 
long-term, interest-bearing note), plus 25.7 million 
shares of Class B nonvoting stock, which convert 
to Class A voting shares when sold.  Its most recent Annual Report (1995) posts assets 
of $851.8 million.
<DD>In January 1994, Health Net merged with QualMed, a Colorado-based HMO, to 
form Health Systems International, which has been actively acquiring smaller HMOs, mostly 
in the Northeast.  Health Net-today a subsidiary of HSI-is actively pursuing the 
Medicare and small-group market, moves that have interesting implications for CWF and its work.  
<DD>As a new foundation, CWF's Board of Directors (then headed by Roger 
Greaves, founder, president and CEO of Health Net) was free to set priorities &quot;unencumbered 
by past funding commitments&quot; (as the 1993 annual report put it) or, for that 
matter, unencumbered by earlier ideological baggage.  Unlike such organizations as the 
Pew Charitable Trusts or the Ford Foundation, which had left-wing agendas thrust 
upon them, CWF has been &quot;progressive&quot; from 
the start.
<P>
<a name="regs"></a>
<B>Education for Regulation</B>
<P><DD>CWF's central organizing concept is &quot;prevention.&quot;  In today's political lexicon, that means far more than immunization programs for kids, X-ray screening for TB or breast cancer, or providing physical exams and dental work for the poor.  The new 
&quot;prevention&quot; includes these, but also much more:  it aims for total elimination of &quot;risk behaviors&quot; 
and anything &quot;bad&quot; in that &quot;complex web of 
conditions.&quot;  A report funded by CWF for the Washington-based Partnership for 
Prevention (of which Health Net is a member) puts it this way:
<DD>&quot;Imagine a new drug that would cure an epidemic . . . a new surgery that would 
correct . . . heart disease . . . a new prenatal 
therapy that would help over 100,000 
low-birthweight babies survive. . . .  Let's go one step further.  Imagine a way to 
<I>prevent</I> the epidemic; to <I>prevent </I> the heart disease; to 
<I>prevent</I>  the low birth weight&quot; (emphasis in original text).
<DD>Desirable as that may sound, full realization of such goals would require 
constant government intervention in people's 
lives, with every behavior added to the lists of targets for modification.  CWF gives 
few details on how this is to be accomplished.  What is clear, however, is that CWF's 
prevention paradigm is a model for a major expansion of the nanny state.
<DD>CWF is not a membership organization, and as a nonprofit with an IRS 
501(c)(3) status it is not permitted to lobby on 
specific legislation.  But it does engage in 
&quot;effecting policy change through public education.&quot;   
In practice, this means convincing the public to 
<I>accept and demand</I>  the laws, ordinances, and regulations CWF believes are 
necessary for public health and &quot;wellness.&quot;  
<DD>Like other foundations, CWF is a money machine; it funnels grants to 
community-based nonprofits and individuals eager 
to make demands for government action, and sponsors university research to bolster 
&quot;progressive&quot; policy initiatives.  But more 
importantly, CWF is a modern, high-tech foundation that recognizes the value of getting 
out the message  especially in California, a big state with expensive media-driven 
politics and a tradition of creating policy by means of ballot initiative.  Thus, CWF recruits 
experienced consulting firms that develop and implement campaigns even to the point 
of serious involvement in state ballot measures and national legislation.  Examples listed 
in the 1995 annual report include:
<UL>
<LI> $500,000 to Public Media Center &quot;to support a public education project on 
health impacts of proposed federal budget cuts on children and families in California.&quot;  
&quot;The campaign joined advocates from a wide 
range of organizations, bringing a unified voice 
to the debate.&quot;
<DD>Public Media Center is a nonprofit, public interest advertising firm based in San 
Francisco, which  as the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> puts it  &quot;Goes for [the] Jugular to 
Push Causes.&quot;  The 20-year-old PMC places more than $1 million in newspaper ads a year in major papers on behalf of clients such 
as Planned Parenthood, Sierra Club, and Handgun Control Inc., according to the 
<I>Journal</I>.  Last year, it placed fear-inducing ads 
opposing the Contract With America.  The Contract &quot;guarantees drastic losses for 
children,&quot; warned one such hyperbolic ad, which 
delineated a parade of horribles that would plague the nation if the Republican agenda 
were enacted, e.g., &quot;neglected and brutalized 
children will not be protected.&quot; 
<LI> $363,000 to the Marin Institute, &quot;to 
build the capacity of five target California cities 
to effectively address the role of alcohol marketing and availability in the economic 
development of these communities.&quot;
<DD>This nonprofit research firm in the North San Francisco Bay Area is hostile to 
both tobacco and alcohol consumption, and explores ways of &quot;empowering&quot; local 
communities to restrict access to them through 
ordinances limiting or banning advertising, sales, and consumption.  The Institute grew out 
of the famous Buck Trust controversy and was established with funds from the Trust.
<LI> $4 million to Public Media Center &quot;to develop and implement a campaign to 
increase [public] awareness about ... Proposition 188.&quot;  This was a 1994 California 
ballot initiative, sponsored by tobacco companies, that sought to curb the ability of local 
communities to enact anti-smoking ordinances that were more stringent than state law.  
PMC &quot;used print, radio and television ads to 
inform Californians about the threat to the 
public's health.&quot;  CWF reports that surveys at 
the start showed Californians in support of the proposition.  After the emotionally 
charged propaganda blitz by PMC, voters rejected 
it (1995 annual report).
</UL>
<P>
<a name="fav"></a>
<B>Currying Favor with the State?</B>
<P><DD><I>Organization Trends</I> has previously documented how foundations establish a 
financial relationship with state and local governments as a shortcut to achieving their 
policy goals, e.g., a new health care plan or 
education reform.  Often these programs have 
little public support  hence, lawmakers are unlikely to provide funding  so the 
foundation gives the state money to run a pilot program.  The state legislators are often 
hardly aware that state agencies are relying on outside grantmakers for policy direction.  Yet the program becomes entrenched.  Eventually the government takes over the funding 
 and the public gets stuck with something it never wanted.  It's an easy way to avoid 
the sticky problems associated with democratic self government.
<DD>Like other large philanthropies, CWF gives money to selected government 
institutions and agencies, local and state, for 
start-up costs of scholarships, fellowships, and 
research projects.  Some examples:
<UL>
<LI> $775,000 to UC Berkeley in 1995 to support the Schools Wellness Project, 
&quot;a...model aimed at transforming 11 K-12 Bay 
Area schools into centers of community health promotion.&quot;
<LI> $30,000 to the L.A. Unified School District in 1995 &quot;to create a program to identify, 
track, and assist pregnant teens.&quot;
<LI> $15,000 to UC Berkeley, School of Public Health, in 1994 &quot;to conduct research on 
the politics of prevention in health care reform and to assess the influence of the work 
supported by [CWF].&quot;
</UL>
<DD>Commenting on this connection to government, former CWF president and 
CEO Howard Kahn wrote:  &quot;Recognizing the central role of government in the lives of all Californians, we have not shied away from involvement with government and 
public policy issues.  Instead, we have embraced opportunities to affect public policy and 
leverage public funds.&quot;  (Leverage is the key word; the foundation provides $100, 
and soon the government is spending $10 million on a state-wide prevention program.)
<DD>This means, Kahn explained, &quot;evaluation of government-sponsored social and 
health service programs,&quot; and &quot;partnering&quot; 
with government &quot;to attempt to influence the shape of new or existing public programs&quot; and to ensure that &quot;prevention assumes a central role . . . in . . . efforts [of health care reform] within California.&quot;
<DD>To those who would raise an eyebrow over a possible conflict of interest between a 
foundation established by a major HMO that is aggressively pursuing Medicare and 
other government contracts at the same time that 
it gives money to government agencies and attempts to &quot;influence . . . public health 
programs&quot;:  Be advised that such activity is 
not only condoned, it's applauded as a fine example of &quot;partnering.&quot;
<P>
<a name="prev"></a>
<P><B>The Violence Prevention Initiative</B>
<P>Although millions of dollars have been awarded for projects in all five program 
areas (cited above), CWF's top priority has been the Violence Prevention Initiative (VPI).  
In just four short years CWF has positioned itself in the vanguard of the gun 
control crusade.  It has committed $30 million to 
this project, with other foundations kicking in an additional $10 million.
<P>Basically this is a gun-control campaign.  It has drawn nationwide public attention 
and has endeared the fledgling foundation to a sympathetic media.  Consistent with its 
organizing principles, CWF claims to have been the first organization to make gun control 
a public health issue.  &quot;The Initiative 
breaks with tradition by putting the issue . . . in 
a public health perspective that centers on prevention,&quot; says CWF literature.    
<DD>Yes, prevention.  What good is it, asks CWF, for a man to receive a clean bill of 
health at the local clinic, if he is killed by gunshot 
on his way home?  The solution?  Get rid of firearms.  After all, if a public health 
department can order the capping of a contaminated water source to stem cholera or order 
restaurants to stop selling tainted hamburgers, it can surely halt an &quot;epidemic&quot; of 
gun-related injuries and deaths.  
<DD>Not surprisingly, many challenge this view.  Edgar Suter, M.D., of Doctor's for Integrity 
in Policy Research, a nonprofit organization in San Ramon, Calif., has analyzed such 
allegations.  In a report titled <I>Targeting 
Deceit</I>, Suter observes that &quot;The chief strategists of the gun ban lobby have attempted to reframe the debate as a `public health' issue 
rather than a crime issue precisely because they have recognized . . . that two decades 
of criminological research has shown the bankruptcy of the claim that gun control 
reduces crime or violence.&quot; 
<DD>By using FBI and Bureau of Justice Statistics, Suter points out that drug dealers 
and drug users are &quot;overwhelmingly and disproportionately the perpetrators and victims 
of violence....[F]ar from being `innocent children,' an alarming two-thirds of gun 
homicides are of teens and young adults in the drug trade.&quot;    
<DD>Such facts make little if any impression on the anti-gun advocates, and they are 
confident of ultimate success.  &quot;This is the 
beginning of a long journey,&quot; Dr. Michael Rodriguez, Research Director of the 
CWF-funded Pacific Center for Violence Prevention, told a Sacramento anti-gun group 
last June.  As reported by the <I>Sacramento Bee, 
</I> Rodriguez warned his audience that they would face &quot;formidable obstacles, much 
like the pioneers of the anti-smoking crusade.&quot;
<DD>&quot;Twenty years ago, people were able to light up wherever they wanted,&quot; Rodriguez 
is quoted as saying.  Indeed.  And CWF is determined that just as the public was 
eventually conditioned to demand local ordinances and state laws to ban smoking in 
restaurants, work sites, and government buildings, 
&quot;education&quot; by CWF will provide the changes 
in public opinion and policy that will cause citizens to surrender their guns.  Here's 
how some of CWF's grant money is being spent on its anti-gun initiatives.
<UL> 
<LI>$650,000 every other year to fund two-year fellowships for ten community 
activists scattered throughout the state.  Also 
three annual $25,000 &quot;Peace Awards&quot; to 
selected community leaders.
<LI> $400,000 each to 17 community organizations &quot;to implement violence 
preventionprojects.&quot;
<LI> $200,000 to the Center for Investigative Reporting in San Francisco to produce 
and distribute a national televised documentary on the firearms industry.
<LI> $40,000 to the San Francisco-based Legal Community Against Violence (LCAV) for 
a resource manual, <I>Addressing Gun Violence through Local 
Ordinances</I>, a how-to book for anti-gun activists and attorneys.  It 
explains how to enact municipal ordinances that outlaw &quot;Saturday night specials&quot; 
and banish dealers from residential and other &quot;sensitive&quot; areas.  It offers advice on 
how activists can build public support for so-called &quot;rational gun regulation,&quot; and how 
to resist legal challenges to already enacted anti-gun ordinances and regulations.
</ul>
<DD>In 1992 a major grant of $1.3 million (part of an eventual total of  $7.5 million) was 
allocated to establish Rodriguez's Pacific Center for Violence Prevention.  The money went to the Trauma Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group based in San Francisco's 
General Hospital.  The Trauma Foundation has long assaulted gun ownership  going so far as to run full-page ads in major newspapers to promote anti-gun legislation.
<DD>CWF's 1993 Annual Report detailed the work of the new Center:  &quot;[L]inking 
several leading activist organizations, the Pacific Center is helping train those involved 
with the [Violence Prevention] Initiative in order to create a statewide network of 
advocates who can educate the media, public 
officials and other leaders on the public health 
perspective for violence prevention.&quot;
<DD>One such &quot;linking&quot; was with LCAV to produce the resource manual on 
passing local ordinances.  Pacific Center provided staff assistance, while Policy Director 
David Farrar contributed his expertise.  The LCAV project also borrowed anti-smoking 
activist Mark Pertschuk, son of former FTC 
Chairman Michael Pertschuk, of the California 
Preemption Education Project (a joint project of Western Consortium for Public Health 
and Americans for Nonsmokers Rights), which receives funding from CWF.

<B>Playing the Child Card</B>
<P><DD>Of all CWF activities, the one generating the most publicity has been the Campaign 
to Prevent Handgun Violence Against Kids.  Begun in 1993, it uses TV ads, public 
service announcements and direct mailings &quot;to 
mobilize citizen action.&quot;  CWF shamelessly 
plays the child card.  This tried-and-true tactic originated with Marian Wright Edelman 
and her Children's Defense Fund.  It entails a three-step process:  First, define an 
issue (e.g., health care, gun control, poverty) as 
a children's problem.  Second, propose a government solution.  Third, attack those 
who disagree with the specific policy as anti-children.  Thus, &quot;There are too many 
handguns, too many gun dealers and too many kids losing their lives to this epidemic, and it needs to stop,&quot; foundation President Gary Yates told the 
<I>L.A. Times</I> in April. 
<DD>The TV ads, narrated by veteran Hollywood leftist Ed Asner, told Californians 
the &quot;number one killer of kids . . . is handguns.&quot; 
 A second ad shows guns on an assembly line, with a voice-over: &quot;Business is 
booming, a handgun is produced every 20 seconds and they're put to use on our kids.  Ten kids are killed every day.  A kid commits suicide with a handgun every 8 hours.  It's an epidemic.&quot;  Suter notes that a &quot;kid&quot; 
includes anyone up to age 18  even young thugs involved in drug trafficking.
<DD>Viewers could call a toll-free number and receive a Citizen Involvement Kit, a 
brochure containing the names of community organizations to contact (most of them funded 
by CWF), names and addresses of elected officials, and a list of meaningless &quot;facts&quot; 
with which to confront officials, e.g., &quot;There are 
18 times more gun dealers than McDonald's in California.&quot;  The kit also contained 
three postcards to send to legislators asking: 
What are you doing to prevent handgun violence against California kids?
<DD>Behind the scenes of this endeavor has been the private political consulting firm 
of Martin &amp; Glantz.  Based in Marin County, it lists among its clients The Nature 
Conservancy and the Ford Foundation.  Partners Angie Martin and Gina Glantz (no relation 
to anti-tobacco enthusiast Stanton Glantz) have earned a reputation for the skill with 
which they manage advocacy campaigns.  They received over $2 million through 1994, and 
in 1995 were awarded an additional $6 million over three years &quot;to continue and expand 
the multimedia public education campaign.&quot;
<DD>A highlight of this campaign to date was a statewide, 90-minute teleconference 
titled &quot;First Aid for What's Killing Our Kids: 
A Prescription for Prevention,&quot; which 
&quot;joined the public and policy makers in 
Washington, D.C. and 18 conference sites in an 
unprecedented discussion of specific policy options for reducing violence.&quot;  The 
teleconference, held in February 1995,  featured 
pre-recorded appearances by Donna Shalala, secretary of Health and Human Services, 
and U.S. Senators Bill Bradley (D-NJ) and Barbara Boxer (D-CA).  The 1,600 participants 
made the following predictable policy recommendations:
<UL>
<LI> Banning so-called Saturday night specials
<LI> &quot;Home rule&quot; for handgun regulation 
(the preemption tactic)
<LI> Regulation of handguns as a consumer product
<LI> Increasing the penalty on carrying a concealed handgun
</UL>
<DD>The 1995 annual report describes &quot;the groundbreaking video-conference&quot; in 
glowing terms as &quot;an important tool for [CWF's] policy goal of developing long term public awareness and support for preventive 
solutions to handgun violence.&quot;  Ironically, 
these recommendations would result in greater violence.  Since criminals ignore gun laws, 
disarming innocent citizens is a policy that costs more, not fewer, lives.
<DD>The obsession with guns explains CWF's mission completely, and it also says a great deal about modern-day liberalism.  CWF 
and politicians like President Clinton focus on issues like gun control and cigarettes 
because they do not have the answers to the broader 
problems afflicting society.  Thirty years ago, liberals 
thought they had the answer:  massive government 
spending and regulation.  But that didn't work; as the 
president said in his State of the Union Address earlier this year, 
&quot;the era of big government is over.&quot;  Intellectually exhausted 
and unable to win popular support for big new 
statist schemes, those seeking to score political points 
have found that guns and tobacco companies provide easy 
targets.  It is no surprise that the president has tried to make 
so much of his opponent's assertion that cigarettes are 
not necessarily addictive for everyone.  Likewise, CWF 
and other foundations have no solutions to the social 
issues confounding America.  So they rail against guns and cigarettes.
<P>
<a name="preg"></a>
<B>The Teenage Pregnancy and Birth Prevention Initiative     </B>
<P>
<DD>While the lion's share of CWF activity to date has focused on the gun &quot;epidemic,&quot; 
it appears that the foundation has even bigger plans for its teenage pregnancy initiative 
 that is if money allocation is any indication of intent.  
<DD>Until this year the Initiative received comparatively little funding, but that has 
suddenly changed.  CWF plans to award $60 million over ten years.  Only two grants 
were listed in the 1995 annual report, though they were sizable:
<UL>
<LI> $570,000 to the California Public Health Foundation to support the organizing 
and implementation of planning and advisory groups meetings.
<LI> $3.5 million to the Public Media Center 
&quot;to design and implement the first phase of a public education campaign.&quot;
</UL>
<DD>More recently, the April 18 <I>Chronicle of
Philanthropy</I> listed nine newly awarded grants totaling $6.14 million for this Initiative. 
 Of that, $5 million is to be paid over four years to the California Family Planning 
Council based in Los Angeles, &quot;to implement a 
clinical-services and prevention model for pregnant teenagers at family planning 
organizations in high-risk areas.&quot;  Also listed in 
the <I>Chronicle</I> as a special grant on 
Reproductive Health and not as part of the Initiative, 
is $50,000 to the Washington-based National Advisory Board on Ethics in 
Reproduction for &quot;administrative support and . . . 
ethical review and analysis of reproductive-policy issues.&quot;
<DD>The VPI is a cover for promoting public acceptance of gun-control.  Is the 
teenage pregnancy initiative just camouflage for 
pushing abortion as a public health measure?  While the word 
<I>abortion</I> is never mentioned in CWF literature, the title  &quot;Teenage 
Pregnancy <I>and Birth </I> Prevention Initiative&quot; 
 presents unclear euphemisms that make one wonder what the program envisions.  
The 1994 annual report admits part of the program will include finding out &quot;what has been 
learned about preventing pregnancies and births among teenagers.&quot;  Sex education and 
family planning, we're told, &quot;are <I>not</I> enough&quot; 
(emphasis in original).  CWF seems to be planning programs far beyond condom 
distribution and birth control pills.
<DD>The rationale for doing something, anything, about teenage pregnancy is 
presented in terms sure to appeal to overburdened taxpayers.  Most teenage girls who 
have babies are poor and go on welfare, and they and their children are caught in a 
descending spiral of poverty and welfare 
dependence which costs tax dollars.  Perhaps it's just 
an oversight, but CWF does not seem at all concerned about illegitimacy and 
focuses attention on teenage pregnancy <I>per 
se</I>--which could include young married couples. 
 That is, as CWF presents the issue, the problem is not so much girls having 
babies out of wedlock, but girls having babies.<HR>
<B>Rather than orchestrating propaganda campaigns, why 
doesn't CWF underwrite the research necessary to discover the cause 
and cure of cancer, AIDS, stroke, and other diseases to which 
humans are prone?<HR>
</B><BR>
<DD>One can appreciate concern about welfare and other costs to the taxpayer.  But is 
there another, more pressing consideration?  A full-term birth in a hospital runs 
anywhere from $2,000 to over $5,000plus prenatal and post-delivery care.  However, an 
elective abortion costs only a couple of hundred dollars.  
<DD>Health Net, CWF's parent, is in stiff competition with other HMOs for 
MediCal (California's Medicaid program) contracts. 
 Under capitation, the government pays an HMO so much per member.  The 
more MediCal members are assigned to it, is it 
more cost efficient to &quot;educate&quot; teenagers 
and their families to agree to abortion when 
there's an &quot;unplanned&quot; pregnancy, rather than 
giving birth, keeping the child or placing it for adoption?  A cynical observation?  Perhaps. 
 But Health Net has the reputation among health care professionals as being the 
most cost-conscious of all the HMOs.  And one of the biggest criticisms of managed care 
in general is that too much attention is paid to costs at the expense of care.
<P>
<a name="tragic"></a>
<B>A Tragic Allocation of Funds</B>
<P>
<DD>With its vast resources and connection to a major HMO, CWF could do truly 
wonderful things in the field of biomedical research.  
In a January 22 article, <I>Time</I> detailed how 
HMOs are swelling their coffers through increased memberships, only to renege when it 
comes to paying for expected medical care.  
<I>Time</I>  reported several cases of women being 
denied bone-marrow transplant therapy for breast cancer  a last-ditch, though 
not extraordinary procedure which might have saved their lives, or at least relieved 
their suffering.
<DD><I>Time</I> explained that Health Net won't 
cover any treatment it deems experimental or investigative, and considers bone marrow 
transplants such, yet like other HMOs, &quot;it 
spends nothing on research to hunt for new treatments for disease....[I]t feels bound by 
law and competition to avoid such research.&quot;  According to 
<I>Time</I>, Health Net recently rejected a proposal to allocate money to 
research ovarian cancer, fearing that under the Americans with Disabilities Act the 
company would be held liable for discrimination against people with other forms of cancer 
and other diseases.  
<DD>But if an HMO itself can't or won't pay for research, would it not be a true benefit 
to humanity for its foundation to do so?  Rather than orchestrating propaganda 
campaigns against unapproved behaviors and attempting to strip us of our right to 
self-defense, why doesn't CWF underwrite the 
research necessary to discover the cause and cure 
of cancer, AIDS, stroke, and other diseases to which humans are prone?
<DD>The tendency of foundations such as the California Wellness Foundation to 
support strategies for social and political control 
on individual behavior in the name of &quot;prevention&quot; is one of the oddities of 
contemporary liberalism.  Once defenders of individual 
freedom, they have become prim overseers of personal deportment.

<H1><CENTER>A New Social Contract for America</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER>by Bruce Chapman</CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
	We probably all know that costs  of entitlements are the main source of
federal budget deficits, and the problem is destined to get dangerously
worse as the Baby Boom generation ages. We all know, too, that ordinary
families--especially the young--are having a hard time saving independently
for their old age. And, we all know that elderly voters, as a group, are
easily convinced that any perceived reductions in these programs are unfair.
Less widely recognized is that younger voters are waking up to this issue;
witness recent university student council resolutions protesting the grim
future of Social Security.<BR>
<BR>
	The solutions we hear from government usually involve little more than
reduced benefits and raised taxes. But the futility of this approach, especially
for Social Security,  is evident from just one statistic. In 1945 there
were 20 American workers to support each Social Security recipient. Today
the figure is 3.1 workers per recipient. By 2030, as today's children reach
middle age, there will be fewer than two workers for each beneficiary. <BR>
<BR>
	Sharp benefit cutbacks of roughly 40 percent and payroll tax hikes from
15.3 percent to 15.7 percent will be needed in a few years to maintain the
solvency of Social Security, but they will devastate workers and retirees
alike. The entitlement programs themselves are thus becoming a source of
poverty and social insecurity  in this country.<BR>
<BR>
	Fortunately,  there is an exciting, win/win strategy for solving the Social
Security problem, at least, and it is beginning to attract broad, bi-partisan
support. The most responsible thing the two presidential candidates can
do about it this political campaign year is to agree to consider it seriously
next January, when there will be less temptation to demagogue.<BR>
<BR>
	But the public needs to start discussing the idea right away, because this
solution--using the private sector to rescue Social Security--no longer
will  be possible in a few years, once the Baby Boomers themselves have
retired. Action is needed in the next couple of years.<BR>
<BR>
	There are now several plans out to use capitalism and the &quot;miracle
of compound interest&quot; to provide a brighter future for American workers.
The libertarian Cato Institute has one, and so does Martin Feldstein, Harvard
professor and former chairman of President Reagan's Council of Economic
Advisers. Republicans, naturally, tend to like the idea.  Steve Forbes elicited
cheers when he embraced the idea at the University of Arizona debate during
the presidential primary season. A similar program, many point out, already
works spectacularly in Chile.<BR>
<BR>
	But one of the first and most carefully researched American plans is that
of a former Democratic candidate for Senate from Delaware, Sam Beard, founder
of the National Development Council that has helped create inner-city jobs
under four presidents of both parties, organizer of the Jefferson Awards
for community service, a fellow of the Discovery Institute in Seattle--and,
most importantly, author of a new book, &quot;Restoring Hope in America:
The Social Security Solution&quot; (ICS Press, San Francisco).  Beard's
first post-publication address will be  in Seattle next Tuesday, May 14,
at 7 p.m. in the University of Washington's Kane Hall Room 220, co-sponsored
by Discovery Institute, The Seattle P.I. and the UW Graduate School of Public
Affairs.<BR>
<BR>
	I was introduced to Sam Beard about a year and a half ago by the P.I's
publisher, J.D. Alexander, and immediately saw in him the classic example
of the enterprising generalist seized with a life-changing big idea.<BR>
<BR>
	Under Beard's plan, present Social Security recipients would receive exactly
what they have been promised, and those approaching retirement also would
stay part of the plan we have now--guaranteed. But young people just starting
out in the workforce would be given the opportunity to put their Social
Security taxes to work in investment funds in the private market, much as
regular mutual funds and annuity programs operate. The government's role
would be to allocate each taxpayer's money to the fund he or she selected
and to make certain that the funds are organized in a sound manner. Workers
in the middle-age brackets (such as Baby Boomers) could mix their forms
of participation, partially paying into the present system and partially
investing in the new Social Security investment funds. <BR>
<BR>
	The plan works because the private sector is so much more productive than
the public sector, which, in any case, does not invest its Social Security
funds, but spends them as they come in on other government priorities. (What
we have today is a great chain letter scheme that would be illegal in the
private sector.) The Beard plan also will work because the huge Baby Boom
generation presently--and for the next few years--is pumping into the government
far more than the older generation of recipients is taking out. Under the
&quot;Restoring Hope&quot; plan, that surplus will be invested rather than
squandered on other programs. A one-time, long term and, of course, voluntary,
bond program for better-off taxpayers will cover the budgetary shortfall
caused by the government's shift of Social Security money that it is &quot;borrowing&quot;
now back into the Social Security program for which it was intended.<BR>
<BR>
	What this plan offers the elderly is just what they have, without danger
of later cutbacks. What it offers the young is hope for a secure old age:
roughly 50 percent more money annually than from the present system, or
twice as much if they choose to treat the program as an annuity. For a $30,000
a year wage-earner,  after 45 years, this would come to $18, 424 a year,
versus $13,710 under Social Security (all of this is in constant dollars).
Capital of roughly $368,486 could be passed along to heirs. Alternatively,
the recipient could use his accumulation as an annuity, raising his annual
receipt to $29,256. <BR>
<BR>
	Knowing that they are accumulating real savings and that these funds are
working away in the private sector will give all wage earners an investment
in the future of the overall economy, a stake most presently lack.  What
it offers the country as a whole is a huge increase in the savings rate
and a brake on inflation and interest rates. No wonder it has won praise
from  sources as varied as William F. Buckley and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.,
and from both Democratic Sen. Robert Kerry of Nebraska and Republican Sen.
Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming, co-chairmen of the Social Security Commission.
<BR>
<BR>
	&quot;Restoring Hope in America&quot; is nothing less than a new social
contract, a chance to unite rather than divide us, to heal generational
and class differences rather than increase them. It is the program of shared
economic growth and security that we badly need.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>The Princess and the Barbarian</CENTER>

</CENTER>
</H2>
Once upon a time in a distant mountainous land there was a young and beautiful
princess who loved to wander in the woods. The forest was deep below the
snowcapped peaks and the valleys were quiet and safe. She could go freely
without care or fear. She could saunter along the trails that took local
merchants and messengers toward the passes to neighboring lands and brought
them back laden with news and commerce. She could watch for birds radiant
among the leaves and sometimes glimpse a deer dancing through the brush.
In summer she could swim in the brooks that hurtled down the mountains and
gathered in pools in the crevices. She was carefree and gay, at ease with
nature and the world.<BR>
<BR>
Then one year trouble struck this halcyon land. A barbarian moved into a
cave somewhere in the woods and began to prey on the merchants and messengers
making their way through the mountain passes. Although groups of young men
formed posses to pursue him, he was so strong and swift and so resourceful
in the ways of the woods and canyons that no one could catch him. Commerce
slowed and the kingdom grew steadily poorer. Merchants could travel only
in large groups protected by warriors. The king and queen bade the princess
to halt her wanderings and stay in the castle night and day. Someday, they
said, she would be queen, but until then she would have to learn the ways
of the palace. She pined for her dark and secret places among the trees,
but she did not disobey.<BR>
<BR>
One night, however, her sleep was beset with dreams of serpents. She woke
in fear as shadowy shapes lurched on her walls and sinister sounds whirred
outside her window. She went to the sill, parted the curtains, and gasped
at the wild beauty beyond. Through the trees, waving their arms in the night
winds and glistening in the moonlight, she could see deep into the forest
that she longed to explore. She yearned to run along the sylvan paths and
feel the pine needles under her bare feet and the breezes against her face
and in her hair. She longed to spy on the creatures of the night. Surely,
no one would notice or care if she should steal down the stone stairs and
step out on the moonlit path.<BR>
<BR>
As it happened, that same evening the barbarian, also restless in the night
season, set forth into the lunar darkness down the path that led toward
the castle. He walked quietly, like a cat slinking through the woods, until,
startled by the sound of steps, he slid behind a huge oak. At first he thought
he had heard some animal and raised his club. Then he sensed a human rhythm
in the paces and steeled himself for a robbery. When the princess finally
came into view, he gasped at the sight of her- -a beautiful girl garbed
only in a silken gown--gliding barefoot along the trail.<BR>
<BR>
Never before had a vision moved him so powerfully. The luminous night and
the woman alone, the shape and the shadows, reached in beyond his bearded
face and bristling chest and touched his sinuous heart. He stepped forward
and asked her if he might walk with her a while. She screamed and fled.
He pursued her, caught her, and pulled her to the ground, ripping her gown.
Then he seized her flailing arms and shook her to silence.<BR>
<BR>
Soon, however, he sensed that he wanted less to overpower than to please
her. Entranced by the wonders of her strong young body, he pleaded with
her to stop struggling--he meant her no harm. She told him to go ahead and
kill her if he wanted her, but to do it quickly and mercifully. He insisted
he had no desire to have her dead. He wanted her alive; he wished to hold
her body against his in the night. She said she would die first.<BR>
<BR>
He then changed his approach and asked her again if she would walk with
him for a while in the woods. She consented; it was a way to gain release
from his grasp. But as they strolled along, his gruff voice softened. With
quiet authority he described his life in the woods among the fierce animals
that threatened his survival and that he sometimes had to kill to escape.
She listened and marveled as he told her fantastic tales of the barbarian
life. She had never before heard of the struggle for life in the wilds beyond
the castle walls. They walked together until the glow of dawn shocked her
to her senses and she said she had to run back to the castle. The great
barbarian slumped in helpless anguish. She assured him she would be back
the next week to learn more. But to the barbarian, a week seemed an eternity.<BR>
<BR>
The next week she once more sneaked away from her bed after midnight and
walked in the woods with the barbarian. When the sun rose he lunged for
her, and she delicately slipped aside, saying she would be back again in
another seven days. The next week they once again walked and talked for
hours in the night. Finally he asked her to come back to see the etchings
on the walls of his cave.<BR>
<BR>
She said no, she would never go back to his lair until he halted his attacks
upon the merchants and messengers of the realm. He said robbery was his
way of life; all men robbed in one way or another; the king's entire territory
had been stolen from the barbarian's forebears, the natives of the land.
She told him severely that he had better find another way of living if he
expected her ever to visit him in his cave. He should make a clearing, build
a cabin, and grow a garden in the woods. He could collect nuts and berries
and hunt small game. With all his knowledge of the wilderness he could live
well, and she would come weekly to hear his tales of the night wood.<BR>
<BR>
The barbarian was heartbroken. The idea of a different life frightened and
repelled him. He was a nomadic predator, born to run in the forest and prey
on the weak. But finally he saw that he had no choice. To avoid losing the
princess, he recognized at last that he would have to give up the barbarian
life and get to work. And so he did. By the time he met her seven days hence,
he had cleared a large space among the trees. Within six months he had planted
a garden and built a cabin.<BR>
<BR>
During that time no robberies were reported on the road. Commerce with neighboring
kingdoms expanded rapidly as travel grew safer and merchants could go through
the mountain passes without an expensive guard of young warriors. With the
country growing richer, the barbarian did well selling wood and nuts to
the people. At last one day, after showing her his trove of produce, his
cabin enlarged with an octagonal wing, and his large gardens and herds of
goats, he asked the princess to marry him. Joyfully she said yes and brought
him back to the castle to meet her father and mother, the king and queen.<BR>
<BR>
At first the king declared that the barbarian's background made him entirely
unsuitable to be the mate of his precious daughter. But the queen replied
with a smile that he too had been something of a barbarian in his day and
he had to confess that this was true. The barbarian was certainly a refreshing
change from the unctuous courtiers who had previously pursued the princess.
The king and queen soon welcomed the youth as a strong and resourceful husband
for their daughter and an asset to the realm.<BR>
<BR>
The wedding brought a huge celebration throughout the kingdom. After a nostalgic
honeymoon in the cabin in the woods, the couple moved into the castle. Freed
from the ravages of the barbarian, the land continued to prosper. After
the princess's parents died, the barbarian himself became king and expanded
his domains deep into the mountains and the forest. In the course of time
the new queen bore a daughter and the daughter too grew into a beautiful
young princess, who, like her mother, hearkened to the call of the wild.<BR>
<BR>
As the realm grew ever richer, the king and queen invited famous wise men
from a neighboring kingdom to entertain at court. These men told of seductive
new ideas. They chilled the king and queen with tales of the death of God
and the eclipse of law, and excited them with accounts of the joys of libertine
sex. They brought books and art celebrating the new freedoms that followed
the breakdown of traditional morality and religion. They told of a city
called New York where everything indeed was new and free.<BR>
<BR>
The young princess listened avidly. Poring over the books, she learned of
the powers that princesses held in other nations. She learned to disdain
the stodgy, hardworking life of her parents' kingdom and to long for a land
where happiness was the only goal. As time passed these ideas gnawed at
her nocturnal thoughts. Like her mother she found her sleep disturbed by
serpentine dreams, and she would walk in the woods to quell the disquieting
desires that flooded her young body.<BR>
<BR>
Then a crisis struck the country. Another barbarian--as young and strong,
ruthless and resourceful as his predecessor--moved into the forest and began
preying on the commerce between the kingdom and the neighboring realm. Once
again the land became poor, and this princess too was forbidden to walk
in the woods. The princess, however, rebelled against her parents and continued
her excursions.<BR>
<BR>
One night she found herself suddenly confronted by the young barbarian.
She was even more beautiful than her mother, and the barbarian surged with
admiration and desire. He asked her if she minded if he walked with her
for a while. Deeply bored by her life in the castle, she agreed. They sauntered
along the path discussing the flaws of the king and the oppressive rules
within the walls. Shortly he put his arm around her shoulders and she pulled
away and said please, not yet. He asked her if she would return with him
to see the etchings in his cave. She suggested they first walk longer and
get to know one another better. But eventually they visited his cave together.
When she left at dawn, she promised to return the next week. &quot;Wow,&quot;
she exclaimed, &quot;you're good!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
For the next several months she visited with the barbarian every week and
they reveled in the cave. Then one day, a king arrived from the progressive
country of the wise men to visit with the father of the princess. This foreign
king was the most charming and cosmopolitan man the princess had ever seen.
He told her of the great riches and romantic forests of his land, of the
advanced universities and museums, of the flourishing commerce and art.
And after everyone went to bed, there was a knock on the door of the princess's
chamber.<BR>
<BR>
The princess opened the door and saw the foreign king outside, garbed in
a robe of purple velour. He asked to come in. He stayed until dawn, and
as the morning light suffused the room, along with the royal aroma of his
Paco Rabanne, he asked her to return with him to his kingdom. He would divorce
his queen and marry her. They had &quot;drifted apart,&quot; he said, and
his marriage &quot;was no longer a growthful experience.&quot; His wife
needed &quot;more space,&quot; and in his progressive views and liberated
lifestyle, he discovered he had far more in common with youth than with
his own generation. The princess agreed joyfully. Banishing the barbarian
in the woods from her thoughts, she returned the next day with the king
to her new land.<BR>
<BR>
Each week the barbarian waited in the forest for his princess. But she never
came. After a while he gave up waiting and angrily escalated his attacks
on the commerce between the two nations. As time passed, the mood of license
fostered by the wise men induced many young men to join the barbarian in
the woods. The nation fell into ruin and the forest became a jungle, ruled
by barbarians, where no princess ever dared to tread.

<H3><CENTER>Happy Conservative Pit-Bull Turns Ten <BR>
by <BR>
<I>Bruce Chapman </I></CENTER>
</H3>
<HR><BR>
Polls show that the public primarily blame Republicans in Congress, rather
than President Clinton, for the recent (and future?) government shutdown.
Those who blame both sides equally think that the battle is merely &quot;political&quot;
in the worst sense. At the state level, Referendum 48, the property rights
initiative, was soundly defeated earlier this month by a margin of 60-40.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Is the conservative revolution running out of steam? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
No--not to hear John Carlson tell it on his KVI radio afternoon talk show.
Indeed, the jovial Carlson, who infuriates liberals, is even more gleeful
than usual these days as he urges Seattle area listeners to deluge the President
with ball point pens to encourage him to sign a balanced budget. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In truth, there are good reasons for conservatives to smile. Though politically
at sea for years, they finally can smell dry land. History, their onetime
foe, seems to be on their side now. Significantly, while conservatives are
keeping their promises, the opposition is accepting their premises. The
issue in Washington, D.C., for example, no longer is whether to seek a balanced
budget, but how to achieve it, and how soon. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Once you get the issues defined your way, it is possible to stop fighting
rear-guard actions and go for a clear cut victory. When you really reduce
spending growth to below the rate of inflation and commit in fact, not fancy,
to a balanced budget, you can expect the Federal Reserve to lower interest
rates. In anticipation of that, markets already have rallied. If you go
on to reduce taxes on families and capital gains, economic expansion becomes
sturdier, and philanthropic giving grows. If you genuinely constrain government
over-regulation and decentralize government functions, personal liberty
is enlarged. Seeing that all this really is possible, the voters want more.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Thus, conservatives may lose some day-to-day propaganda struggles, but the
long term &quot;fundamentals&quot; of their position (as economists might
say) are sound. In about two more elections they may emerge not only as
the normal governing majority in politics, but also the major force in intellectual
life--the status that liberals have occupied since the Depression. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The liberals' ideas came out of academia, starting with the first self-conscious
&quot;political scientists&quot; at Princeton and Johns Hopkins at the turn
of the century. Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson created
the huge federal civil service, and it, too, generated ideas. The media,
which was mostly conservative or neutral until 40 years ago, swung to the
left in the 1950s, with a few notable exceptions, and gave liberalism an
aura of moral superiority and political inevitability. Even big business
was leery of wandering outside of the supposed liberal &quot;consensus.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The seeds of conservative renaissance, however, were planted during the
very heyday of the liberal intellectuals by a philosopher named Russell
Kirk and a small magazine edited by young Bill Buckley, <I>National Review</I>.
But it has prospered thanks largely to an institution created in the present
generation: the think tank. Some think tanks--or public policy institutes--are
liberal, but most are not, and as you look at the pages of national and
local magazines and newspapers, or listen to TV discussions and radio talk-shows,
you are bombarded by the news and views of &quot;fellows&quot; in &quot;institutes.&quot;
That's new. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In national affairs, it happened first in Washington, D.C. with creation
of the American Enterprise Institute (eclectic conservative), the Heritage
Foundation (&quot;movement&quot; conservative, with a $28 million budget),
and Cato Institute (libertarian), among others. But then a second phase
occurred--explosively--at the state level, and, at last count, there are
now some 60 think tanks around the country specializing in local and regional
issues. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In Portland, there is the Cascade Institute and in Olympia, the Evergreen
Freedom Foundation, led by former state legislator Bob Williams. But the
oldest public policy group in the Northwest is the Washington Institute,
founded by John Carlson, which is about to celebrate its 10th anniversary.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I am prejudiced, I admit it. I have enjoyed John's company ever since he
was a delightfully irreverent college student at the University of Washington,
assaulting the choleric dogmas of The UW Daily . He is still irreverent,
and whether you find that delightful or not probably depends on your politics.
He's also smart and constructive. By founding the Washington Institute in
1985 and helping it to survive this long, he has given state and local government
a whole new source of political ideas and initiative. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
John has now graduated to a perch as institute &quot;chairman&quot; so that
he can devote more of his time to harrying the left from his talk show,
a weekly column and regular appearances on two TV discussion programs. Stomping
around on the grapes of liberal wrath, he still lands hard on the toes of
antagonists, but his writing and wit have matured like a vintage Merlot.
Visiting dignitaries pay him court, and one of these days he is going to
wake up and find that he is part of the Establishment. But, happily, not
yet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, an energetic former insurance executive, Bill Baldwin, runs the
institute's show out of donated offices in a West Seattle building with
the biggest American flag you ever saw. From there issue papers decrying
state regulatory and budgetary excesses, calls for stronger defense of property
rights and a tough line on crime. A couple of years ago the institute helped
conceptualize the &quot;Three Strikes, You're Out&quot; legislation that
now wins nods even from The White House. Institute arguments were used by
state legislators who rolled back Gov. Lowry's health care plan. At the
moment, high priority is attached to increasing privatization of many state
government functions. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the midst of this policy agenda, Washington Institute also publishes
Counterpoint, a newsletter that assigns itself the role of watchdog on the
watchdogs of the media, usually biting at their heels, but also making &quot;good
dog&quot; awards. Overall, critiquing the press is not exactly a winning
strategy for assuring coverage of your other programs, but it does keep
many readers amused and gratified, and maybe it does some good in reminding
members of the Fourth Estate that they, too, are human. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For all of this, the state's watchdogs of the right are grinning as they
nip away. Every dog must have its day, and, after 10 years, the sun does
not seem at all ready to set on the Washington Institute. <BR>

<P><H2>Forbes and term limits' enduring appeal</H2>
<HR WIDTH=50%>
 </CENTER>

<P>To hear the reports about Steve Forbes' prospects in the Republican presidential race in Iowa and New Hampshire, he's a Johnny-One-Note: the flat tax. In fact, Mr. Forbes is a Johnny-Two-Note: He has also been crusading for term limits for the U.S. Congress.

<P>While the media are generally known to be disdainful of term limits, the public has consistently expressed overwhelming approval for virtually every single one of the various proposals to limit the amount of time elected representatives may serve. Whether in the form of state laws that unilaterally limit their own representatives' terms in Congress or a constitutional amendment that would limit the federal terms of all elected officials, public support for term limits is extraordinarily consistent and extensive. One poll last year found 76 percent declaring that they would favor term limits even &quot;if limiting the terms of Congress meant that you would never be able to vote for your current member of Congress or for your senator.&quot;

<P>Before the U.S. Supreme Court last May declared unconstitutional all term-limit laws applying to the U.S. Congress, virtually every state where the issue came to a vote had passed term-limits referenda. By then, 23 states had term-limit laws, including 14 of the 17 contiguous states west of the Mississippi. The historic 5-4 Supreme Court decision, in which both of President Clinton's appointees voted with the majority, means only a constitutional amendment will suffice to impose restrictions on Congress.

<P>Not since the tax revolt issue erupted in 1978 in California with the passage of Proposition 13, which reduced and then limited property taxes, has a political issue gained such resonance among voters. Mr. Forbes' appeal undoubtedly arises from the popularity of both his major issues: tax reform and term limits.

<P>Less than two months before the Supreme Court's decision, the House failed to achieve the necessary two-thirds approval to pass a term-limits constitutional amendment. Many Democratic opponents had hoped - indeed, some of them may have even prayed (in private, of course) - that the court's subsequent decision would make the issue moot for 1996. Well, they had better pray a little harder. The issue is certain to come to the fore in the fall campaign.

<P>At the time the amendment went down in the House last March, a Gallup poll revealed that more of the public held Republicans responsible for the failure than Democrats. No doubt this was a result of the media's spin, gloating about Newt Gingrich's failure to pass a term-limits amendment. In fact, although the idea is not universally endorsed by Republicans, 82 percent of them did vote for the constitutional amendment in the House. Had a mere 50 percent of Democrats supported the amendment, instead of only 19 percent, it would have passed. By the time November rolls around, it is extremely unlikely that the public will be as misinformed about apportioning blame as it was in the immediate aftermath of the March House vote.

<P>In terms of effectiveness of independent efforts, this issue has great potential. Already, term-limit proponents, such as the U.S. Term Limits organization, have said they will exert pressure on 1996 congressional candidates to pledge themselves to vote for a constitutional amendment. These same organizations no doubt will again actively intervene in various races, as Americans for Term Limits did in 1994, helping to defeat then-Speaker Tom Foley, Democrat of Washington, and then-House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jack Brooks of Texas. And they will be joined by Ross Perot's United We Stand America.

<P>In fact, a Newsweek poll recently found that 68 percent of respondents said Mr. Perot's new Independence Party should work toward passing term limits as either its most important goal (17 percent) or one of several important goals (51 percent). Last April, 40 percent of adults questioned by Gallup said they would be &quot;very likely&quot; and another 29 percent said they would be &quot;moderately likely&quot; to vote for an independent presidential candidate if they believed that only he or she would support term limits for members of Congress. Talk about single-issue dominance. On the margin, these kinds of numbers have landslide potential.

<P>So, how prominently do you think Republicans will feature term limits in their platform? And how vulnerable will the 81 percent of Democrats who voted against a term-limits constitutional amendment be? With numbers like this, it might just be enough to get Bill Clinton to try to steal the issue.

True social security
</FONT><HR WIDTH=50%></center>
<P ALIGN="LEFT">
<br><dd>
Want to save the Social Security system? Start privatizing it. If that sounds like the advice of some crazed conservative with a political death wish, then think again. In February, the New York Times reported that a Clinton administration advisory panel is on the verge of recommending that a portion of workers' payroll taxes be invested in the stock market. Some members of the panel would even allow workers to make their own investment decisions.
<br><dd>
"Our proposal," said Sylvester Schieber, an employee benefits specialist and member of the Advisory Council on Social Security, "would give people the widest choice of investment options. People could invest their Social Security money as they invest the money in their individual retirement accounts. Beyond the floor of protection provided by Social Security, we should let people participate fully in this economic miracle that we call America. It's paternalistic to assume that people cannot take action in their own self-interest."

<br><dd>
Washington, of course, is filled with well-intentioned paternalistic types who presume to know more about what's good for people than the people themselves. That includes saving for retirement. In all likelihood, someone with a similar mindset on the council leaked the news of its draft findings in order to rally opposition to it. That's just the way Washington works. The 13-member panel, which was appointed by Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala in June 1994, is scheduled to issue its findings in the spring.

<br><dd>
According to the Times, there are at least two key recommendations in the current draft. First, eight of the 13 members favor shifting some portion of Social Security investments from long-term, interest-bearing government securities into common stocks. Edward Gramlich, professor of economics and dean of the University of Michigan's School of Public Policy, rightly notes that stocks have significantly outperformed bonds over the long term. Panel member Robert Ball, a Democrat and former Social Security commissioner, would invest up to 40 percent of program revenues in the market based on recommendations by a board of government money managers.

<br><dd>
Second, some panel members actually favor creating an individual account for each person covered by Social Security. Although Social Security would still hold the accounts, beneficiaries would choose from, say, 10 options on how the account would be invested.

<br><dd>
These aren't the only issues at stake here. The level of Federal Insurance Contributions Act taxes, the eligibility age of Social Security recipients, changes in benefits and the timing of any reforms in the program would all have to be taken into account should the federal government decide to implement them. In that regard, reformers should keep a couple of things in mind. First, the sooner the reforms, the easier it would be to accommodate them. Waiting until Social Security is on the verge of going broke, as it will if the program continues at present, would require drastic changes in eligibility, taxation and benefit requirements.

<br><dd>
Second, the Social Security program today is nothing more than a transfer of tax funds from one generation to the next. Unlike other investment instruments such as stocks, therefore, investing in Social Security is nothing more than a bet on the willingness of future workers to pay payroll taxes. Given its choice, the Clinton administration's advisory council would rather bet on the stock market.

From NORTEL<I> The Next Century: Perspectives on the Information Age<BR>

<H1><CENTER>The Network as Computer</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER><EM>by George Gilder <BR>
<BR>
</EM><IMG SRC="videonoise-purple.gif" WIDTH="512" HEIGHT="6" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P>In the oceanic sweep of the information age, the once separate streams
of computers and telecom are converging into new digital floods of innovation
that shift as inexorably as the tides of the sea. As we rush toward a millennial
crest of invention, a new tidal shift is at hand.<BR>
<BR>
At the heart of this shift is not the computer industry, which has long
ruled supreme, but the telecom equipment industry. Because average citizens
have always preferred communicating to computing, the shift from computers
to networks will transform the fruits of progress - once chiefly accessible
from the lofty reaches of the elite - to an everyday harvest as popular
and ubiquitous as the phone.<BR>
<BR>
The latest cycles began in the years following the Second World War, when
the telecommunications industry spearheaded research that brought such key
advances as the transistor and the laser. Over the last forty years, the
computer industry has ridden the transistor to dominance in the information
economy. New laser-based breakthroughs in fiber optics, however, now promise
to turn the tide again toward telephony. While the computer will still be
king, the network will become the computer.<BR>
<BR>
The siege of computer progress has been sustained over the last twenty years
by Moore's Law, based on the famous prophecy by Intel founder Gordon Moore
in 1978 that the number of transistors on a single chip would double every
eighteen months. Implicit in Moore's Law is a similar doubling every eighteen
months in computer power: the number of millions of instructions per second
(MIPS) that a single microprocessor or personal computer could perform.<BR>
<BR>
But the epoch of Moore's Law dominance is now ending. The silicon microcosm
- the physical source of innovation in microchips and computers - is giving
way to the optical telecosm and its even more rapid pace of advance in communications
power.<BR>
<BR>
Signaling the transition from microcosm to telecosm is one key metric: the
performance of publicly available networks compared to the performance of
the internal computer buses that connect microprocessor central processing
units (CPUs) to memories, hard drives, keyboards, and monitors. Today, new
fiber optics and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) systems being launched
by leading telco suppliers are overthrowing the key foundations of computer
industry supremacy on the leading edges of innovation. Now in view, as early
as next year, is a bandwidth crossover point where the communications power
of widely available telephone networks will surpass for the first time the
communications power of the internal buses of personal computers.<BR>
<BR>
During the 1980s, while telecom bandwidth apparently stagnated, North American
phone companies installed some ten million miles of optical fiber - in effect,
a new bandwidth infrastructure in North America. So far, less than one-millionth
of the potential communications power of this fiber has been delivered to
customers.<BR>
<BR>
Now this potential bandwidth is about to erupt as a kinetic force of change
in the information economy. Telephone companies plan to increase the maximum
bandwidth of corporate services from the current 2.4 gigabits per second
to 40 gigabits per second in 1997. They will quadruple capacity, and quadruple
it again within the next three years.<BR>
<BR>
The explosion of bandwidth, however, will not transform the information
economy until it is delivered to people's homes. Delivery of the new tides
of bandwidth requires that telcos commanding advanced fiber and switch capabilities
collaborate with cable companies possessing broadband lines to homes.<BR>
<BR>
The most important short-term bandwidth expander is ATM. It radically simplifies
the switching problem by putting all information in uniform 53-byte cells
that can be processed entirely in silicon chips without time-consuming access
to memory and software. With guaranteed delivery of cells on a fixed schedule
soon to reach a pace of 2.4 gigabits a second, ATM can manage multimedia
voice, data, and video all at the same time.<BR>
<BR>
These new technologies can largely eclipse the difference between an internal
hard drive and a remote archive or digital library. PCs will be able to
tap databases and libraries across the world as readily as they can reach
their own hard disks or CD-ROM drives.<BR>
<BR>
For manufacturers of telecom equipment, this new architecture provides huge
opportunities to launch new ATM systems on every scale, new network hardware
and software, and new optical communications equipment. The companies that
truly grasp that the network is the computer, and invest in the infrastructure
of the new networked economy, will dominate the decade.<BR>
<BR>
However, amid these torrents of bandwidth abundance, the greatest rewards
will accrue to people around the globe, joining the ever-expanding circles
of prosperity in an age of information.<BR>
<BR>
Many skeptics suggest that the new technologies will chiefly favor the already
prosperous and powerful in the industrialized countries. But the first beneficiaries
of the new age are Asian nations, from India and Malaysia to Indonesia and
China. Trapped in Third World poverty as recently as two decades ago, they
are now supplying crucial components to major telecom and computer companies
and leading the world in rates of economic growth.<BR>
<BR>
Over the next decade, digital networks will provide a new central nervous
system for the world economy. Transformed by convergence and computerization,
TV will burst forth in a new flowering of choice and empowerment. An abundance
of multimedia choices can remedy and reverse the cultural debacle of mass
market television. Transcending the current programming of the lowest common
denominator, video culture will effloresce into a plethora of products as
rich and various as books and magazines.<BR>
<BR>
Great cities will give up their current role as hives of industry and emerge
as havens of social activity and entertainment. On the network, an inner-city
child in public housing can pursue a curriculum far richer in learning resources
and far better adapted to personal needs and aptitudes than the program
of an elite suburban school today. Equipped with ATM and fiber-optic links,
small towns will become creative centers in the information economy. Productive
citizens will retreat to rural redoubts and reach out to global markets
and communities. Hollywood and Wall Street will become historic curiosities
as their businesses diffuse to all points of the continent and the globe.<BR>
<BR>
Perfectly targeted to the most acute problems of the era, the new technologies
can reverse the spirals of decay afflicting many institutions and communities.
Traffic and pollution, ignorance and waste, can all give way to worldwide
webs of glass and light. <BR>
<BR>
The home will re-emerge as an industrial center, with marriages gaining
new roles and meanings around the evolving silicon hearths of a new cottage
economy, thus strengthening family values.<BR>
<BR>
Lowering the costs and raising the effectiveness of medical care will be
the on-line house call, sharing scarce diagnostic tools, tapping remote
specialists, and bringing busy doctors back to the patients' bedsides in
targeted teleconferences.<BR>
<BR>
Throughout all these changes, one theme will triumph: the empowerment of
individual families and customers against remote and irresponsible organizations.
In essence, people will no longer settle for whatever or whoever is playing
on the tube or at the mall or in the local corporate center. Instead, they
will seek out and command their first choices in jobs, culture, entertainment,
and religion.<BR>
<BR>
Ranging across continents to find the best colleagues for every major project,
workers will scale new pinnacles of productivity and wealth. A culture of
first choices will evince a bias toward excellence rather than a bias toward
the mediocre, the vulgar, or the vicious.<BR>
<BR>
The age of mass manufacturing, mass marketing, and mass media brought capital
and labor together in vast pyramidal corporations, tying workers to the
machine and the tube. The explosive centrifuge of the telecosm will burst
these chains of industrial concentration. Yielding single-chip supercomputers
linked in global broadband networks, these technologies fling intelligence
beyond the boundaries of every top-down institution and machine-age social
system.<BR>
<BR>
Bandwidth abundance not only fuels the advance of electronics; it also galvanizes
the growth of economies. The new media extend the webs of news and interconnection
that nourish markets and expand opportunity. <BR>
<BR>
Lavishing the exponential gains of networks, endowing old jobs with newly
productive tools, and unleasing creativity with increasingly fertile and
targeted capital, the advance of the telecosm offers unprecedented hope
to the masses of people who the industrial revolution passed by.<BR>
<BR>
Rather than giving millions of viewers access to five hundred channels of
one-way TV, the new technology will give all users two-way teleconferencing
with colleagues regardless of where they are - reading documents and books,
sharing multimedia experiences, consulting with specialists on your rare
disease at the Mayo Clinic or Columbia, touring Venice and Vancouver the
same day, dallying simultaneously at the Louvre and the London Museum, designing
a new building with an architect in Israel or a new dress with a couturier
in Paris or a new chip with a guru in Silicon Valley.<BR>
<BR>
Through these channels, the poorest citizens will gain access to new worlds
of education, employment, entertainment, medical care, and communication
now commanded only by elites - a true transfer of power to the people everywhere.<BR>

<P><FONT SIZE=6>How many Madison millions?</FONT>
<HR WIDTH=50%> 
</CENTER>

<P>Just how much money has the failure of the Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Association cost taxpayers? Depending on the source, the timing of the estimate, and the method of calculation, the taxpayer-absorbed losses have been variously estimated at $47 million, $50 million, $60 million, $65 million and $68 million. At one time or another, each of these figures was accurate, but currently even the $68 million estimate substantially understates the cost to taxpayers.

<P>According to a spokesman at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC), which is the government agency now responsible for keeping score, Madison's bankruptcy has so far cost $73 million. And that is only through 1994. The burden literally grows daily, and no estimate of its ultimate cost can be made at this time.

<P>Why these losses continue to escalate and how Hillary Clinton and the president contributed to them are worth reviewing. After all, Mr. and Mrs. Clinton relentlessly campaigned in 1991 and 1992 by denouncing the 1980s as &quot;a gilded age of greed and selfishness, of irresponsibility and excess.&quot;

<P>For all practical purposes, and contrary to the assertions of Richard Ben-Veniste, the minority counsel for the Senate Whitewater committee, all of the bad loans contributing to Madison's financial debacle had been granted before July 1986. At that time, the federal government removed Madison's owner, James McDougal, and placed Madison under direct federal supervision, ending the hemorrhaging. When Madison was formally closed down in 1989, the feds estimated its losses at that time to be $47 million, which essentially represented the difference between the cost of paying off depositors and the then-estimated value of Madison's assets.

<P>Over time, however, the ultimate value of Madison's assets continued to decline, according to the FDIC. As in the case of most failed S&amp;Ls, some loans that were believed to be partially recoverable when the thrift was closed eventually proved to be worthless, adding to the initial loss estimate of $47 million. And taxpayers, of course, had to continue to pay property taxes for Madison's failed real-estate ventures until they were sold for losses. While in receivership, interest payments applicable to Madison's borrowings from the federal financing bank continue to accrue, marginally adding to the taxpayers' burden. And litigation expenses are a factor as well. So as not to divulge to potential targets the scope of the government's legal efforts, the FDIC won't provide a breakdown of the sources of increases in the taxpayers' liability until litigation is concluded.

<P>In an absolute sense, compared to some failed S&amp;Ls whose costs exceeded $1 billion, Madison's $73 million taxpayer hit is small. According to FDIC records, however, the percentage of Madison's losses relative to its deposit base is very high even by S&amp;L bankruptcy standards, exceeding 60 percent. That means for every $100,000 of taxpayer-insured brokered deposits - so-called &quot;hot money&quot; - that Madison was able to attract by offering significantly higher interest rates than its competitors, more than $60,000 went down a rathole. This is a truly astonishing accomplishment - Madison's loan losses proved to be more than 20 times the federally required capital base of 3 percent of deposits.

<P>Of even greater interest is the fact that Madison's loan activity increased dramatically after Mrs. Clinton was hired in April 1985 to represent the thrift before the state regulatory body responsible for approving Madison's plan to meet federally mandated recapitalization requirements. Approval was given in May 1985 after Mrs. Clinton telephoned the chief state regulator, who, as a former law student and campaign volunteer of Gov. Clinton, had been appointed by him four months earlier. In 1985's third and fourth quarters, Madison's mortgage loans increased by $32 million. This six-month, $32 million mortgage-portfolio increase was nearly four times the size of Madison's entire mortgage portfolio as of Dec. 31, 1983, when the feds issued numerous cease-and-desist orders.

<P>As sordid as all of this is, just be thankful that 1996's campaign will not be a replay of 1992's, when the thoroughly corrupt, congenitally hypocritical Arkansas crew lectured Americans about the moral hazards of &quot;the corrupt, do-nothing values of the 1980s.&quot;

Dear Senator:

I urge you to terminate Senator Alan Simpson's (R. WY) legal 
immigration proposal, S. 1394, at the Senate subcommittee 
level. 

The Senate immigration subcommittee will soon begin markup 
of S. 1394. Unfortunately, Senator Simpson's legal 
immigration legislation intensifies the restrictive measures
of Representative Lamar Smith's (R. TX) immigration 
proposal, H.R. 2202. 

Senator Simpson seeks a 25% tax on businesses that hire 
foreign workers. Under S. 1394, companies hiring foreign 
help would have to pay a tax equal to one-quarter of 
the employee's annual compensation including wages and 
benefits. In addition, employers would be forced to pay 
that employee 105% of the prevailing wage (an expansion of 
the job-killing Davis-Bacon Act). 

Additionally, the new limits on skilled immigration coupled 
with the arbitrary experience requirements will 
significantly lower the number of skilled workers admitted 
to the U.S. annually. Moreover, elimination of the unskilled
immigration visas, prevents families from uniting. Unskilled
immigrants do not displace American workers. The measures of
S. 1394 (and similary House proposals) will do more to 
displace American workers than any perceived move by 
employers to bypass American labor for foreign workers. 

Contrary to the less government principles espoused in 1994,
S. 1394 and similar House proposals, increase government 
spending, expand governmental control over businesses and 
will ultimately weaken the U.S. economy. I strongly oppose 
S. 1394, and I ask you to do the same. 

Sincerely,

<b>Gun Control:  Is the Tide Turning?</B><BR>
<I>Battleground Shifts to the States</I><P>

<DD>Gun control is one of our society's most contentious issues.  It 
arouses strong opinions and inflames emotions on both sides of a debate that 
has become inextricably linked to concerns about crime.  Both factions in the debate see 
crime as central to their respective arguments.  
Does the availability of firearms contribute to crime? 
 Or does gun control leave law-abiding citizens defenseless against armed criminals? 
 Much more is at stake than the answers to these questions.  For some, guns are a 
symbol of all that is wrong with our 
violence-prone society; for others, gun-ownership is a 
fundamental right, an indispensable element of a free society.  
<DD>Much of the gun control debate has focused on the edges of the issue, as the 
opposing sides try to define the limits of the country's acceptance of firearms.  In 
recent years, attention has been focused on gun control measures at the national level.  
In 1993, after seven years of lobbying, Handgun Control, Inc. finally succeeded in pushing 
the so-called &quot;Brady Bill&quot; to passage.  The bill, named after former White House Press Secretary James Brady, mandates a five-day 
waiting period between purchase and delivery of a handgun.  A year later, as part of the 
1994 Crime Bill, Congress passed a ban on the importation and domestic manufacture of 
a number of semi-automatic firearms, so-called &quot;assault weapons.&quot;  Anger over the 
passage of these two pieces of legislation helped 
fuel the backlash against congressional Democrats that led to Republicans taking control 
of Congress for the first time in forty years.
<a name="debate">
<P><B>The Debate Over Concealed Weapons Packs A Lot of Heat</B>
<P>
<DD>Despite gun control activists' success in tightening gun laws at the national level, 
a broad-based and little-noticed movement has been working in the states to liberalize 
restrictive gun laws.  This &quot;Quiet Revolution&quot; in the states has focused primarily on 
changing state laws to allow individuals to carry 
a loaded, concealed firearm.  
<DD>In 1987, Florida became the first state in recent times to relax its concealed 
weapon laws.  Shortly thereafter, a number of 
other states followed suit, and the trend continues. 
 In 1995 alone, ten states liberalized their requirements.  Most of these states now 
have what is known as a &quot;shall-issue&quot; 
system, under which applicants are deemed to have a right to obtain a CCW (Carrying 
Concealed Weapon) permit, and the state must 
provide an affirmative reason to deny the issuance 
of one.  For example, states may deny applicants who have prior felony convictions or a 
history of mental illness.  They may also require proof of a certain level of proficiency with 
a handgun.
<DD>Naturally, such changes have not come without considerable controversy.  
Opponents of the Florida measure predicted carnage in the streets and suggested that 
the state's new moniker would be the 
&quot;GUNshine State.&quot;  One hysterical newspaper 
editorial summed up fears about the new law:  
<blockquote><I>&quot;[A] pistol-packing citizenry will mean 
itchier trigger fingers . . . South Florida's climate of 
 smoldering fear would flash like napalm when every stranger totes a piece, and 
every mental snap in traffic could lead to the 
crack of gunfire.&quot;</I></blockquote>  
<DD>The facts paint a far less frightening picture.  Handgun Control, Inc. (HCI) 
argues that CCW reform &quot;has not made Florida 
a safer place.&quot;  While conceding that the 
homicide rate has decreased, HCI observes that violent crime in Florida increased by 
17.8 percent in the five years following enactment of CCW reform.  But this tells only part of 
the story.  While violent crime did increase in Florida, it rose by 22.3 percent 
nationally, noticeably higher than the jump in Florida.  
In addition, fears of legally licensed firearms carriers turning minor disputes into 
deadly confrontations proved baseless.  Of 314,938 licenses issued since the law went into 
effect, only 470 have been revoked for any reason.  
<DD>Contrary to the assertions of anti-gun lobbyists, the evidence indicates that an 
armed citizenry generally has a deterrent effect 
on crime.  According to sociologists James Wright and Peter Rossi, criminals tend to 
be more concerned about encountering an armed victim than about being arrested by the 
police.  Wright and Rossi conducted two studies commissioned by the U.S. Department 
of Justice in the 1980s that examined the attitudes of incarcerated criminals towards 
violent crime.  They interviewed over 1,800 convicted felons who were in prison in ten 
different states.  A majority of these felons 
claimed to worry more about dealing with an armed victim while committing a crime than 
about running into the police.  That's one reason why so many crimes are committed 
outside the home:  criminals fear armed homeowners. 
 And when criminals do target houses, they pick residences where no one is home 
to avoid the possibility of being shot at.  Criminals prefer preying on people on the streets: 
 thanks to concealed weapons restrictions, they will most likely be unarmed.  
<DD>Wright and Rossi's study seems to validate the common assumption that 
civilian gun ownership has a significant deterrent effect on criminal behavior.  Thirty-four 
percent of the felons interviewed indicated that at some point in their criminal careers 
they had been &quot;scared off, shot at, wounded, 
or captured by an armed victim.&quot;  
<DD>How often do private citizens use firearms for self defense?  It is difficult to 
obtain precise figures, since many of these uses 
are never reported to the police, but research by Florida State University criminologist Gary Kleck provides some insight.  Dr. Kleck 
undertook a huge study in 1992-93, asking nearly 5,000 people detailed questions about 
whether or not they had used a firearm to protect themselves from crime, and if so under 
what circumstances.  From the results of this 
study, Kleck estimated that close to 2.5 million Americans annually actually use firearms 
for self-defense.  In the vast majority of these cases, no one is killed or wounded, and 
rarely are shots even fired.  
<DD>It is generally recognized that localities with the strictest gun control laws do 
not have lower crime rates than jurisdictions with less restrictive laws.  For example, the 
District of Columbia has probably the strictest 
gun control laws of any municipality, and it has 
an extremely high crime rate.  Neighboring Virginia, with relatively few gun control 
laws (and a shall-issue system for CCW since 1995), has a much lower crime rate. 
<P>
<a name ="nra">
<B>National Rifle Association</B>
<P>
<DD>The participants in the political debate over concealed weapons are familiar 
and their positions are predictable.  What's different is the political strategy that 
opponents of gun control are using.  Increasingly 
frustrated by gridlock in Washington, groups like the National Rifle Association have 
turned their sights on the states, and they have 
had remarkable success in changing laws once considered politically unalterable.  Of 
these laws, CCW reform is the most recent and perhaps the most significant change.  
<DD>The largest, most powerful and probably best-known organization is the National 
Rifle Association (NRA).  Founded in 1871 by a number of ex-Union army officers to 
promote civilian marksmanship, the NRA has grown to over three million members 
nationwide, and it has an annual budget of nearly 
$155 million (1993 figures).  The NRA is a 
501(c)(4) organization, as is its lobbying division, 
the Institute for Legislative Action (ILA).  This means it is tax-exempt but, because it is 
organized to influence legislation, contributions to it are not tax-deductible.  The NRA has 
an affiliated PAC, the NRA Political Victory Fund, and a number of affiliated 501(c)(3) 
organizations, including the NRA Foundation, Firearms Civil Rights Legal Defense Fund, 
International Shooter Development Fund, National Firearms Museum Fund, and the 
NRA Special Contribution Fund.  In the 1993-94 election cycle, the NRA's PAC 
contributed almost $6 million to congressional 
candidates of both parties across the country  The ILA itself spent another $2 million on 
mailings, phone banks, and other benefits to pro-gun 
candidates. 
<DD>For most of its existence, the NRA concerned itself with training people in the 
safe and proper usage of firearms and in sponsoring shooting competitions.  This began 
to change in the late 1960s as increasingly restrictive gun control laws were proposed 
and passed, most notably the Gun Control Act of 1968.  For a time, there was 
considerable debate within the NRA about whether 
increasing the group's focus on political issues was compatible with its traditional 
interest in promoting marksmanship.  This debate continued through the 1970s, and 
culminated in the &quot;Cincinnati Revolt&quot; in which 
the NRA's executive vice-president and a number of board members who favored a 
less active political role were replaced by politically-oriented activists who wanted to 
fight gun-control legislation.  
<DD>The NRA is actively lobbying at the national, state, and local levels.  Working 
in conjunction with state organizations, NRA has successfully pushed for CCW reform 
in 19 states, and it is close to passing 
legislation in several others, including Missouri 
and New Mexico.  In this effort, the NRA works closely with sportsmen's organizations, 
including hunting and target shooting clubs, as well as with crime victims' groups.  In 
the field of CCW reform, NRA has so far worked exclusively at the state level, entirely 
bypassing the U.S. Congress.  NRA is lobbying for the adoption of laws at the state level 
that are patterned on Florida's CCW law, which establishes a shall-issue system placing 
some basic requirements on license holders..
<DD>Following the death of NRA President Tom Washington in 1995, First 
Vice-President Marion Hammer assumed office, 
giving the NRA its first-ever woman president.  
The former president of Unified Sportsmen of Florida, Hammer was instrumental in 
lobbying the Florida legislature for the passage 
of the state's CCW reform in 1987.  Hammer is a life-long Democrat and a grandmother 
who has already purchased firearms for her three grandchildren.  
<DD>It is perhaps not coincidental that the NRA's president and its chief lobbyist, 
Tanya Metaksa, are women at a time when the organization has begun to emphasize the 
importance of training women in the use of firearms. 
 This new emphasis underscores the NRA's traditional interest in firearms training.  But 
it also seeks to enlist women as a new political constituency to the ranks of those who 
believe the possession of firearms is a crime deterrent. 
<P>
<a name="gun">
<B>Gun Owners of America</B>
<P>
<DD>The other major national organization pushing for CCW reform is a more recent arrival 
to the gun control debate.  Founded in 1977 by former California state Senator H. L. 
&quot;Bill&quot; Richardson, Gun Owners of America 
presents itself as &quot;the no-compromise gun lobby,&quot; and its position on CCW reflects that.  
<DD>In contrast to NRA, Gun Owners is pushing for adoption of handgun carry laws 
modeled after those in effect in Vermont.  Alone among the states, Vermont does not 
require a permit of any sort to carry a concealed handgun.  State law makes it a crime to 
&quot;carr[y] a dangerous or deadly weapon, openly 
or concealed, while committing a felony.&quot;  
Gun Owners calls current CCW reform legislation &quot;phony,&quot; and it opposes concealed 
carry laws that require any &quot;government 
approval, permission, license, or tax&quot; to obtain a 
permit to carry a concealed weapon.  Gun Owners argues that the CCW reform legislation 
that has been adopted by most states discriminates against the poor and minorities 
because it requires application fees and the cost of firearms training that states require 
for certification to carry.  More importantly, Gun Owners argues that any government 
regulation of firearms possession will inevitably lead to further restrictions as well as 
violate constitutional rights guaranteed by the 
Second Amendment.
<DD>Politically, Gun Owners is outside of what is usually considered the political 
mainstream; it is not concerned about angering the 
political establishment.  Gun Owners has been willing to endorse and support 
candidates for public office who are considered 
longshots with little chance of winning.  In 1994, 
for instance, Gun Owners, unlike the NRA, enthusiastically backed Republican 
Steve Stockman in his congressional race against longtime House Judiciary Committee 
Chairman Jack Brooks (D-TX).  Brooks had angered Gun Owners by working for passage 
of the 1994 Crime Bill, which contained a ban on the importation and manufacture of 
certain kinds of military-style firearms known as 
&quot;assault weapons.&quot;  Gun Owners had no 
compunction about challenging Brooks, a powerful member of Congress who had 
enormous influence over gun control legislation.  Stockman went on to defeat Jack Brooks and 
became one of the &quot;Giant Slayers&quot; of the 
1994 congressional election.
<DD>Gun Owners has had limited success promoting its preferred version of CCW reform. 
 Despite the many states considering reform legislation, Gun Owners has not 
convinced any to enact its purer version.  Gun 
Owners remains an outsider, occasionally scoring a policy success, but mainly working to 
influence the course and scope of the gun control debate.       
<a name="cit">
<P>
<B>Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms</B>
<P>
<DD>Also involved in the debate is the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and 
Bear Arms, and its affiliated 501(c)(3), the 
Second Amendment Foundation.  Citizens Committee is headquartered in Bellevue, 
Washington, and employs John Snyder, an active political foe of gun control since the 1960s, 
as a congressional lobbyist in Washington, DC.  Citizens Committee was originally 
founded as a committee of the Young Americans for Freedom, but later became independent.
<a name="hand">
<P>
<B>Handgun Control Inc.</B>
<P>
<DD>Anti gun groups have scored notable legislative successes in recent years.  In 
1994, following the election of Bill Clinton, they secured federal legislation placing 
restrictions on handgun purchases and banning so-called assault weapons.  However, 
the gun control groups have had few successes in the latest state legislative battles over 
the right to carry concealed weapons.  Like many other big government advocacy groups, 
their power is concentrated in Washington, DC.  They thrive on coalition-building and 
on public relations imagemaking in the national media.  The real question is whether 
these advantages can survive renewed grassroots challenges by state and local defenders 
of Second Amendment rights.   
<DD>The largest and most powerful opponent of CCW reform is the 501(c)(4) 
Handgun Control, Inc. and its affiliated 501(c)(3), 
the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence.  Compared to the NRA, HCI is a new arrival 
in Washington.  It was founded as the National Council to Control Handguns in 1974 
by Mark Borinsky, a community activist who was mugged by an assailant who used 
a handgun.  Borinsky was joined in 1975 by Pete Shields, a former DuPont 
executive, whose son was the last of the victims of 
the infamous &quot;Zebra Killer.&quot;  Shields 
became executive director of NCCH in 1976. 
<DD>In 1985, the Council (renamed Handgun Control in 1978) gained a new board 
member who gave the group a much higher profile.  Sarah Brady's involvement in the gun 
control movement came about in a very public way:  her husband James Brady, 
Ronald Reagan's press secretary, was shot and almost killed in the 1981 attempt on 
the President's life.  Brady's name soon became synonymous with HCI's flagship 
legislative accomplishment, the Brady Bill, a federal 
law which mandates a nationwide waiting period of five business days before the purchaser 
of a handgun can take possession of it.  
<DD>Since its founding, HCI has grown to over 380,000 members, and it has an annual 
budget of over $6 million.  The affiliated Center 
to Prevent Handgun Violence (CPHV) had a budget in 1994 of $2.4 million, which 
mainly funds educational programs ($1.3 million) and a legal action project ($430,000).  
CPHV's educational efforts include its STAR 
(Straight Talk About Risks) program, which is 
intended to convince school-aged children that 
guns are a key  element of criminal violence.  
CPHV also purports to offer safety tips for those who own and keep firearms at home.  
These tips include &quot;EMPTY IT OUT AND LOCK IT UP&quot; and &quot;Explain to children that they 
should NEVER touch guns&quot; (emphasis in the 
original), tips that would preclude the ownership of a firearm for self-protection and the 
imparting of basic gun safety to children.  The advice concludes with the assertion 
that &quot;The safest thing is not to have a gun in 
your home, especially not a handgun.&quot;  
<P>CPHV's Legal Action Project defends gun control legislation in the courts from 
legal challenges by gun rights advocates.  For example, it has filed briefs defending a 
municipal Morton Grove, Illinois law banning handgun ownership and California's 
state ban on assault weapons. 
<DD>The Legal Action Project also has tried to use the courts to secure unlegislated 
gun control.  CPHV has undertaken court cases that would impose a legal doctrine of 
strict liability on manufacturers of so-called 
&quot;assault weapons.&quot;  Under this 
interpretation, manufacturers would be liable for 
damages that result from the misuse of their 
firearms, without regard to the circumstances.  
This back door approach to gun control would effectively end the production of these 
firearms and probably drive the manufacturers out of business.    
<DD>HCI has been very effective at mainstreaming its cause and attracting corporate funding.  In 1993, for example, 
Capital Cities, the owner of the ABC television 
network, and Bell Atlantic, the local telephone monopoly for much of the east coast, 
each gave $5,000 grants to CPHV.  While these are small grants, they give CPHV the 
credibility of an affiliation with major corporations.  
The Capital Cities grant is particularly 
disturbing because gun rights activists have long 
maintained that their point of view is never accurately reported by media outlets such 
as ABC.  When ABC's owner weighs in with what is essentially a political contribution 
to one side of the gun control issue, its capacity for objectivity is seriously in question.            
<DD>In 1986, HCI began what was to become a seven year effort to enact the Brady Bill 
into law.  Shortly after this effort was underway, gun control activists also discovered a 
new target, the so-called assault weapons.  On January 19, 1989, a gunman used a 
semi-automatic version of the Russian AK-47 assault rifle to kill five elementary school 
students and one teacher on a school playground.  Almost overnight, the issue of 
the &quot;widespread availability of 
semi-automatic assault weapons&quot; became a matter of public debate.  Even though the availability and 
use of semi-automatic firearms, almost all of them rifles, with military-style features would 
appear to be a separate issue, &quot;Handgun&quot; 
Control, Inc. quickly took it up with relish. 
<DD>HCI was heartened by the election of Bill Clinton, who was the first president 
since Jimmy Carter to campaign on a platform that included stricter gun control laws.  
Clinton promised to work for passage of both the Brady Bill and an assault weapons ban, 
and in 1994 he fulfilled his promise.  At the 
state level, HCI has been busy opposing CCW reform  but with considerably less 
success. 
<DD>HCI likes to position itself as a 
&quot;moderate&quot; advocacy group pushing for gun control. 
 For the most part it avoids talk of banning guns or adopting other positions that 
might alienate potential supporters.  But after 
the Brady Bill and the assault weapons ban were passed, HCI unveiled &quot;Brady II.&quot;  This was 
its blueprint for national gun control, and it is anything but moderate.  
<DD>Going far beyond the most restrictive state laws, Brady II would mandate federal 
licensing of all handgun owners, registration of 
all handgun sales, and a limit on handgun purchases to one per month.  It would make 
it harder and more expensive to obtain a firearm dealer's license, allow only licensed 
gun dealers to sell ammunition, and make it a 
crime to leave a firearm &quot;accessible&quot; to 
anyone under age 16.  In addition, Brady II would require an &quot;arsenal&quot; license for gun 
collectors; it would ban &quot;non-sporting&quot; 
ammunition, mandate that firearms be made 
&quot;child-proof&quot;, and hold parents liable for 
accidents involving their children's misuse of 
firearms that they own.
<a name="coal">
<P><B>Coalition to Stop Gun Violence</B>
<P>
<DD>If HCI is like the NRA in promoting itself as a &quot;moderate&quot; voice in the gun control 
debate, then the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence (CSGV) is the more hard-core alternative 
for gun control supporters.  Originally called the National Coalition to Ban Handguns, its 
name change illustrates how the group has attempted to widen and obscure its goals. 
 However, unlike HCI, CSGV does not deny that it wants to ban handguns 
completely from &quot;importation, manufacture, sale, 
transfer, ownership, possession and use by the general American public.&quot;  The only 
exceptions it would recognize are the &quot;police, 
military, security officers, and gun clubs where the guns are secured on the club's premises.&quot;  
<DD>Arguing that sporting and recreation is the only legitimate purpose of gun 
ownership, CSGV does not call for an outright ban 
on long arms such as rifles and shotguns (as long as they are not classified as 
&quot;assault weapons&quot;).  But while CSGV supports 
many of the proposals endorsed by HCI, it regards them merely as intermediate steps to its 
ultimate goal of banning handguns.  It would license gun owners and limit handgun 
purchases to one per month for gun owners, limit the availability of gun dealers' licenses 
and raise their cost, increase taxes on handguns and ammunition to pay for health costs 
associated with firearms, and impose its version 
of strict legal liability on firearms 
manufacturers and dealers.  
<DD>CSGV operates on an annual budget of roughly $ 1 million.  Beside its 120,000 
individual members, it has enlisted 46 labor, religious, professional, medical, and 
educational associations as members, including:  
Americans for Democratic Action, the American Jewish Committee, the Center for Science 
in the Public Interest, the National Urban League, the United States Conference of Mayors, 
and the United States Student Association (see page 5 for a full list).
<DD>As with other 501(c)4 lobbying organizations, CSGV has an affiliated 501(c)3 
organization.  This one is called the Educational Fund to End Handgun Violence.  
Established in 1978, the Fund has expanded its activities much like CPHV, operating a program, 
&quot;Hands Without Guns,&quot; for school-aged children.  
Its Firearms Litigation Clearinghouse assists plaintiffs attempting to win damages for 
shooting incidents and for injuries from defective firearms.  It also develops legal theories 
to hold firearms manufacturers liable.  The Fund also hosts an annual conference on 
gun violence and maintains a database of community anti-gun organizations.  It has an 
annual budget of slightly less than $200,000, and receives grants from several 
foundations, including $55,000 from the George Gund 
Foundation and $16,000 from the Kanter Family Foundation.   
<a name="viol">
<P>
<P><B>Violence Policy Center</B>
<P>
<DD>The Violence Policy Center, a think tank for the gun control movement, is the 
newest participant in the policy debate.  Despite 
its small size and lack of recognition, VPC has skillfully disseminated its ideas.  Founded 
in 1988 by activist Josh Sugarmann, VPC has steadily churned out reports and 
publications.  Operating on an annual budget of slightly more than $100,000, the Center 
devotes itself to studying the gun control debate and &quot;educational efforts . . . targeted 
at the general public, public policymakers, and the news media.&quot;  
<DD>While it has examined typical gun control issues such as CCW reform and assault 
weapons, VPC has made the American firearms industry a particular focus of its attention. 
 Indeed, VPC identifies the recent successes of CCW reform as representative of 
legislation conceived to provide &quot;financial 
benefits to all members of the gun lobby.&quot;  In 
<I>Concealed Carry: The Criminal's Companion</I>, VPC argues that the firearms industry, 
faced with stagnant sales, has used CCW reform to expand its markets.  It claims firearms 
instructors believe the training component in CCW reform laws will give them increased 
business.  And it imagines that the NRA sees CCW reform as a way to increase its 
recruitment of members.
<DD>VPC has had a definite impact on the policy debate over gun control.  In 1988, VPC 
published one of the first reports warning against manufacturers of &quot;assault weapons.&quot;  
When the issue acquired national significance, VPC benefitted from the publicity, and it has 
attracted major foundation funding.  Contributions by the John D. and Catherine 
T. MacArthur Foundation, the Joyce Foundation, and the Aaron Diamond 
Foundation suggest the regard in which it is held.  
<a name="state">
<P>
<P><B>The States Lead the Way</B>
<P>
<DD>In late 1994, it looked like gun rights supporters were on the ropes.  With an ally in 
the White House and many supporters in Congress, anti-gun groups had secured 
passage of the Brady Bill and the assault weapons ban, and they were poised to 
accomplish their final goal.  While the anti-gun 
groups tended to work independently of one another, their efforts were dovetailing.  
HCI strove to appear moderate in its calls for federal legislation, and was aided by 
the strident demands of CSGV.  VPC reports and studies provided arguments and data 
for more and stricter gun control laws.
<DD>The election of 1994 stalled the final assault on guns.  But the assault weapons 
ban remains intact, and President Clinton promises to veto any legislation attempting 
a repeal.  Can the anti-gun groups consolidate their gains?
<DD>This may appear to be the current situation at the national level, but it ignores the 
important changes that are taking place at the 
state level.  Reform legislation permitting the 
carrying of concealed weapons is occurring nationwide, and no help from the 
federal government is needed.  Like so many public policy reforms in recent years, from 
school choice to welfare reform, reform has 
&quot;devolved&quot; to the states.  Congress may 
soon get into the act on CCW reform, possibly by considering legislation to allow CCW 
holders to carry guns across state lines.  But for now, however, the federal government is 
not needed for reform to succeed.

<B>Denigrating America's Armed Forces</B><BR>
By Robert V. Pambianco<BR>
<P>
<DD>Lost in the news coverage over the death of Chief of Naval Operations 
Jeremy Boorda, and the concomitant tales about the problems besetting the 
Navy, is the story of just how Admiral Boorda's medals became a cause of concern for 
the news media.  After all, knowledge of campaign ribbons is not the sort of thing 
one expects of reporters.
<DD>It turns out that the medals story was fed to 
<I>Newsweek</I> and ABC News by a little-known outfit called the National 
Security News Service (NSNS).  A charter member of the blame-America-first 
chorus and an appendage of the anti-defense lobby, the Service delivers 
pre-packaged news stories to the media.  Such was 
the case with the account of Admiral Boorda's Vietnam decorations. 
<DD>Since the leg work is already done, the press naturally gobbles up these 
stories hook, line, and sinker.  The <I>Washington 
Post</I>, ABC's &quot;World News Tonight,&quot; 
and &quot;Prime Time Live&quot; have all used NSNS reports, all of which are hostile to the 
U.S. armed forces and invariably designed to denigrate the defense establishment.
<DD>Veteran activist Wayne T. Jaquith founded NSNS in 1990 as an adjunct 
of the Peoples Education Center.  Earlier, Jaquith had been executive director 
of another far-left group called Physicians for Social Responsibility, the 
American affiliate of International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War  one 
of a number of groups used by the Soviet Union to undermine support for 
military preparedness in the West.  As the <I>Washington 
Times</I> reported on May 20, these groups were loosely tied to Soviet 
&quot;active measures&quot; and were conceived by then KGB head Yuri Andropov as a 
replacement for the nuclear-freeze movement, which had lost credibility as a 
result of its more direct ties to Soviet espionage.  Yevgeniy Chazov, health 
minister under Leonid Brezhnev, was the head of the international physicians group.
<DD>Apparently unhappy with the outcome of the cold war, NSNS seems 
determined to inflict revenge on the U.S. military that made the West's triumph 
possible.  Indeed, NSNS's bureau chief, Joseph J. Trento, a former CNN 
reporter, told the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> that 
now that Admiral Boorda is dead, &quot;What we're going to do is look to see if 
there was some other reason that Boorda felt exposed.&quot;
<DD>NSNS receives funding from liberal foundations, most prominently the 
W. Alton Jones Foundation, a supporter of sundry left-liberal causes.  Jaquith 
told <I>Organization Trends</I> that his group 
also receives funding from the John D. &amp; Catherine T. MacArthur 
Foundation, one of America's premier establishment philanthropies.  And he confirmed 
that it had received one grant from the Arca Foundation, which in the past was 
run by liberal gadfly Marge Tabankin, former head of the Hollywood Women's 
Political Caucus and current director of the Streisand Foundation.
<DD>The real story here is not the news service; it is what this tells us about 
the American media.  Groups like NSNS exist on the extreme fringe of the 
political spectrum.  Yet with little effort, they 
are able to sell their wares to unquestioning reporters.  The same reporters who 
would instinctively question the motives of anything prepared by a 
right-of-center think tank, are all too happy to serve 
as a conduit for NSNS's anti-military agenda, while affecting shock and 
disbelief at any suggestion of bias.

Congress' Two Trillion Dollar Opportunity</CENTER>
</H1>
<IMG SRC="aredblue.gif" WIDTH="800" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3"><BR>
<BR>
Mr. Chairman and members of the Senate Commerce Committee, thank you for
inviting me here today during what is a golden, though probably brief, moment
of opportunity for the American economy and civilization. Thanks to the
nature of new technologies and a dawning political awareness that these
technologies have overturned the logic of regulation, Congress has the chance
to free American industry to lead the world into what I have called the
&quot;telecosm.&quot; Ahead is forming an environment of unprecedented hospitality
for individual creativity, family authority and economic growth. What this
telecosm requires from the government now is bold deregulation -- a freedom
model -- of telecommunications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Should Congress fail to adopt a freedom model and persist in the illusory
hope that government can shape the future through regulation, America will
lose up to two trillion dollars of new economic activity -- stock market
values, incomes and job growth. Specifically, unless telephone and cable
companies are allowed to merge or directly collaborate with one another
to create fiber optic systems and digital services in the phone companies'
existing territories, and unless entitlement subsidies and other artificial
regulatory requirements are ended quickly and decisively, financial obstacles
to investment will delay introduction of the pending communications revolution
by five to seven years. Not only will our languid economy lose the massive
two trillion dollars stimulus I am predicting, but America also will lose
its worldwide leadership in telecommunications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I arrive at the two trillion dollar estimate by comparing opportunities
for high technology advances in the 1990's with those of the 1980's, as
illuminated by research conducted by Michael Jensen, recent president of
the American Financial Association, and his students at the Harvard Business
School. Jensen's research reveals how a de-regulated environment aided in
the industrial revitalization that produced such new or reorganized companies
as McCaw, TCI, MCI, Time-Warner, Disney, Turner, and Viacom, and gave a
one and a half trillion dollar boost to the US economy. An even stronger
opportunity awaits the field of telecommunications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In several books and articles I have described the &quot;law of the microcosm&quot;
which ordains that the price-performance of microchips rises by the square
of the increase in the number of transistors on a single chip. Thus, distributed
single-chip systems grow exponentially more efficient than centralized multi-chip
machines, epitomized by the mainframe computer. It is this law of the microcosm
that has revolutionized technological change in the past fifteen years,
and through it, our economy.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now the law of the microcosm is converging with the &quot;law of the telecosm.&quot;
This law ordains that the value and performance of a network of computers
rises apace with the square of the increase in the number of computers linked
to it. As these forces fuse, the world of computers and communications rides
an exponential rocket.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Among the wonders awaiting us in the telecosm is, for example, a &quot;teleputer&quot;
that combines, in one unit, interactive video and telecommunications. It
will replace today's televisions and telephones and lend the users access
to a vast world-wide network of other teleputers: mass communication when
desired, but, more often, highly personalized entry to libraries of texts,
libraries of films, Internet-style forums, teleconferencing from home to
home or home to office, interactive distance learning, virtual family gatherings,
telemedicine and huge new business markets -- all brought within the reach
of ordinary Americans, not just the rich. By making the choices we want,
moreover, rather than the choices someone in a studio or bureaucracy wish
to impose upon us, the frustrated American citizen will gain new authority
and enthusiasm about his ability to affect his work, entertainment, education
and even his government. For merely one small example: just as C-Span circumvents
broadcast producers and brings certain events in Congress directly to viewers,
in the telecosm the viewer will decide on his own which floor action and
which of many committees to &quot;attend&quot; via his teleputer -- including
hearings like this one.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Participation in the telecosm will be affordable for ordinary citizens.
But the initial structural investments will be large for the system developers.
The most expensive part of the conversion to the telecosm is establishing
broadband connections to millions and millions of homes, where, not coincidentally,
the bulk of the new personal computers are to be found. Fortunately, the
United States, almost alone in the world, already has these connections
in place in the form of cable TV.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But cable TV is not likely to survive long in its present state. New technology
-- DBS (Direct Broadcast Satellite), in this case -- is going to blow away
the existing cable companies unless Congress permits them to operate freely.
Currently, cable is a classic example of outdated government regulation
wrongly premised on the danger of monopoly. Cable's hope is to find a new
use. And that new use, in fact, is available, thanks to the needs of telephone
companies -- whose own monopoly of local service is already disappearing,
also in the face of new technologies. Telephone companies require a way
to enter the home to provide broadband connections to the teleputer and
other services, but duplicating cable's connections is an obvious waste
of years of time and hundreds of billions of dollars. New technology thus
closes off old monopoly advantages and opens opportunities for free market
collaboration.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Bringing broadband digitally switched services over cable wires to the home
will still require investments of $l00-300 billion, but these can be and
should be provided by the private sector, without government subsidies or
guarantees. There is no knowing in advance which companies will succeed
in the telecosm and it is futile and counterproductive for government to
guess. The once-legitimate concern about communications monopolies has been
silenced by the centrifugal force of the computer chip. Bigness no longer
assures success in telecommunications, and trying to protect one industry
or company against another when no one can tell which one will survive,
in any case, will only make the needed investments unpromising financially
and set back the movement into the telecosm by five to seven years, well
into the 21st century. On the other hand, if Congress will stop focusing
on how to fine tune regulations and focus instead on eliminating them more
completely, we can have the teleputer and similar revolutionary devices
within the next three years, which -- I might mention -- is within the terms
of many of you in this room. The secret, as Cal Tech Professor Carver Mead
says, is to &quot;listen to the technology.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The futility of regulation is further underscored by the likely creation
of new companies outside any presently foreseen regulatory framework. Either
these information service newcomers will have a government-sanctioned advantage
over regulated companies or the government will find a way to draw the newcomers
into its regulatory grasp -- and perhaps with them, whole previously unregulated
areas of the economy, such as computers and software.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Government regulation supposedly claims to protect competition, of course,
but it is the kind of competition where nobody wins and nobody loses. Such
guarded competition will prevent the restructuring and profit incentives
that must be available to make large investments possible. Only competition
that permits robust rivalries will bring the teleputer and other inventions
on-line swiftly.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Mr. Chairman, last year I was concerned that the Congress was still trying
to develop a regulatory regime based on an outdated belief in natural monopolies
in telecommunications. But, this year I am more hopeful, particularly after
production of the discussion draft advanced recently by Republicans members
of this Committee. Now, indeed, it seems that almost the whole federal government,
including the Executive Branch, is beginning to hum the music of telecom's
de-regulation. But it is not altogether obvious that all of them have bothered
to learn the words. One test of whether claims of de-regulation are valid
is to see whether a proposed law has been adjusted to acknowledge emerging
technologies or whether it still tries to force new technologies to fit
old government regulations. Even the admirable discussion draft the committee
majority produced, I think, should be examined in this light.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For example, consider the issue of universal service. The basic problem
of universal service is that with current wireline telephony and cable TV,
it costs many times as much to serve rural customers as urban customers.
But, new wireless digital technologies have overthrown this problem. At
a time when all voice telephony is rapidly moving to wireless, new digital
cellular systems will soon lower the price of wireless telephony tenfold
and totally close the cost gap between rural and urban customers. This removes
the need for either cross subsidies or universal service requirements.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, as I mentioned, Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS) already delivers
service superior to cable TV with supreme universality across the entire
continent and completely discredits the idea that cable TV is a monopoly
or that hundreds of channels of video will be restricted to favorite areas.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All these examples of technology rendering regulations obsolete should lead
us to the conclusion, then, that the only sound telecommunications policy
is the freedom model. A freedom model would allow all existing companies
-- and new ones yet to be created -- to buy and sell and enter each others'
businesses without undue government interference or delay, granting only
common carrier status in return. It would remove restrictions to cross-ownership
of cable and telephone lines. It would not force companies to separate their
functions unnaturally -- and unprofitably -- into subsidiaries. It would
not impose delayed entry schedules and other invidious tests upon competition.
And, of course, it would not demand universal service or other hidden entitlements.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A freedom model, however, would restrict the powers of state public utility
commissions to regulate investment and depreciation rules, to ensure rate
re-balancing and pricing flexibility. Both cable and telephone companies
should be free of pricing restrictions to encourage investment and to eliminate
the current cross subsidies that discourage competition and the introduction
of new services.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Mr. Chairman, the freedom model of de-regulation is not likely to be any
company's or industry's first choice. Each, of course, would like to preside
over a government-protected monopoly and to enjoy government restrictions
on its competition. That is human nature. But since you cannot possibly
grant special advantages to everybody, it would seem logical that free and
open competition should be accepted as each lobby's second choice. But for
the public interest, I would suggest, the freedom model should be acclaimed
as the logical first choice -- and adopted, accordingly, by this Committee
and the Congress.

How do you Play Cards with China?</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER><I>by Bruce Chapman</I></CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="starbar.gif" WIDTH="592" HEIGHT="26" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=
"BOTTOM"><BR>
<BR>
	Washington Sen. Slade Gorton received headline attention recently  when
he announced that he would not oppose extension of &quot;Most Favored Nation&quot;
(MFN) trading status for China this year. He thereby helped avoid an embarrassing
vote in the Senate at a time when Boeing has major Chinese contracts pending
and Microsoft has just reached a new agreement  on intellectual property
rights.<BR>
 <BR>
	Less noticed, however, was the angry nature of the criticism Gorton heaped
on the Chinese and their apologists here in the United States.  Throwing
down a marker on trade complaints, the Republican senior senator declared
that unless significantly fairer treatment of American companies takes place
in the next year,  he will &quot;lead the fight&quot; against awarding China
MFN status next year.  Coming from a representative of the nation's most
trade dependent state, the pledge is considered reckless swagger by some
observers and political courage by others. Regardless, Gorton, when aroused
by a large principle, is a resourceful legislative foe.<BR>
<BR>
	Meanwhile, Gorton's Democratic colleague, Sen. Patty Murray, is heading
in what seems to be the opposite direction, arguing at a recent conference
of the Washington Council for International Trade that the US should make
MFN status permanent for all nations with whom we have relations (which
is all but the likes of Iraq, Cuba and North Korea). This, she believes
would avoid the annual pain and embarrassment of the MFN debate. Many China-hands
in business and academia agree.<BR>
<BR>
	It seems unlikely that under present circumstances either option will prevail,
however. On one hand, America is too entangled with the China trade and
too smitten with the future of an economy growing by 9% a year to lift anchor
and sail away. Before long, there will be a wholesale turnover in Chinese
leadership as the aged Long Marchers finally retire or die, so US traders
are reluctant to surrender their position now to the Japanese and Europeans.
Slade Gorton is articulate as well as indignant in his cataloguing of Chinese
trade perfidies, but the very businesses he might be expected to have on
his side--software, wheat and fruit growers, for example--are unwilling
to sign up against MFN.<BR>
<BR>
	On the other hand, Sen. Murray's dream of a permanent MFN will make a easy
target for political opponents of the present annual endorsement. This year
the human rights and consumer groups who normally get involved in the MFN
fight decided to stand aside, but they certainly would not do so if a permanent
grant was being considered. Until China-US trade and other relations are
substantially improved, MFN will be retained as a handy weapon.<BR>
<BR>
	Better relations are by no means impossible, of course. Whoever wins the
Presidency in November will want to organize a US/China summit, and maybe
Bill Clinton will attempt one before then, if some attractive agreement
can be sculpted. In recent weeks, the Chinese reversed the hostile rhetoric
of the late winter and promised yet again to crack down on factories that
pirate software and other intellectual property. There are pledges also
to stop trading missile technology with Pakistan and there even are soothing
words from Beijing about the future of Hong Kong, which China will absorb
in one year.<BR>
<BR>
	But there also are trouble signs ahead. American officials, including even
 such critics as Sen. Gorton, agree that trade issues should be separated
from human rights and military issues. But, as a practical matter, China's
human rights abuses in Tibet, the military pressures on Taiwan, government-directed
abortions, prison labor camps, secret shipments of guns into the US, and
threats to democracy in Hong Kong all play as discordant background music
that cannot be ignored and could disrupt the trade dance. <BR>
<BR>
	Hong Kong is an especially tense subject, since the Chinese takeover next
July will occur just after MFN arrives once again before Congress. If the
new Chinese authorities end up arresting Hong Kong's elected political leaders,
censoring the press and exposing the economy to the corruption that too
often characterizes the Chinese version of &quot;free markets,&quot; the
resulting turmoil will not be ignored by either public or official opinion
in the West. The chairman of the Hong Kong Democratic Party, Martin Lee,
in a whirlwind North American tour two months ago (60 speeches in 13 days)
was an effective proponent of MFN for China as well as a critic of Chinese
threats against Hong Kong. Lee in jail, however, would be a powerful symbol
against an attempt to adopt MFN, let alone make it permanent.<BR>
<BR>
	This confusion on the horizon of 1997 actually makes Sen. Gorton's Cassandra-like
warnings potentially very useful. Forgoing sentimentality, he demands that
Americans look with realism at the trade picture, not as it might be, but
as experience has shown it.<BR>
<BR>
	&quot;Five years ago our trade deficit with China,&quot; he reports, &quot;was
$12.7 billion. Now it is $33.8 billion....Will we never learn?...What has
the 'engagement' of the past five years accomplished to cause us to parrot
today the very arguments that have so signally failed in the past?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	Will his fellow members of Congress and the Clinton Administration simply
ignore this warning? Perhaps. But if they do so, the present opposition
to China, which is found only in minorities of the two political parties,
some human rights groups and a fraction of the business community, will
grow. Under that pressure, our relations with China may muddle through,
as they have, but they will not flourish. Already the US is less evident
in investment in China than are our western trade rivals and Japan.<BR>
<BR>
	The constructive alternative is for Congress and the White House to use
the months ahead to examine and update the full range of trade and foreign
policy tools--other than denying MFN--that can be used to influence China.
Expanding current agreements on intellectual property offers one example.
Finding ways to get China to adhere to international trade standards as
a price for admission to the World Trade Organization (WTO) is another.
Yet another is helping the Chinese to see that their current rapid economic
growth cannot be sustained much longer without large private investment
from the west, and that such loans absolutely require a more predictable
legal system. <BR>
<BR>
	In time, it may indeed become possible to abandon the demeaning annual
MFN drill. Meanwhile, the challenge of China policy fairly cries out for
more consultation and creative diplomacy in the councils of the West. The
year ahead is crucial to that purpose.<BR>

  By "lower," we do not mean "bad."  The bliss of marriage 
consists in part in the sexual union of spouses.  That union 
is, in the human species, elevated and inspired by the 
rational and moral union that married people enjoy.  A 
lifetime of commitment, chosen and not dictated by 
instinct, sustained by determination in the face of obstacles, 
is the specifically human satisfaction of human sexual 
relations.  In that context, the human family is a reflection 
of the divine nature of man.

Rights: The Regime of the 'Discrete and Insular Minority,'"

Protection," Virginia Law Review 60:955-974.
  A national marketing survey indicates that the average 
homosexual enjoys a household income of more than 
$55,400, a figure $23,000 higher than the average American 
household.  Homosexuals are far more likely to hold a 
college degree, and far more likely to work in a professional 
or managerial position than average Americans.  They are 
more than four times as likely to travel overseas, or to earn 
over $100,000 annually.  See "Overcoming a Deep-Rooted 
Reluctance, More Firms Advertise to Gay Community," in 
The Wall Street Journal, July 18, 1991, p. B-1.

States," Family Planning Perspectives, March/April 1993, 
pp. 52-60; for an argument that homosexuality is "curable" 
and not etched in genetic stone, see  Mark Hartwig, "Is 
Homosexuality Destiny or Choice?" Focus on the Family 
Citizen, Nov. 16, 1992, pp. 12-14.

Queens," The American Spectator, February 1993, pp. 26-

  Amendment 2, which received 54 percent of the popular 
vote, read as follows:  "Shall there be an amendment to 
Article II of the Colorado Constitution to prohibit the state 
of Colorado and any of its political subdivisions from 
adopting or enforcing any law or policy which provides that 
homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual orientation or conduct, or 
relationships constitutes or entitles a person to claim any 
minority or protected status, quota preference or

the United States to adopt a bill of rights, noted that 
"independent tribunals of justice will consider themselves in 
a peculiar manner the guardians of those rights."  1 Annals 
of Congress (Gales and Seaton, eds., 1834), p. 457.  For the 
Progressive view see J. Allen Smith, The Spirit of American 
Government, pp. 299-300: "In carrying out the original 
intent of the Constitution with reference to property the 
courts have developed and applied the doctrine of vested 
rights-a doctrine which has been used with telling effect for 
the purpose of defeating democratic reforms."

Critical Analysis of "An Economic Interpretation of the 
Constitution" (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1956).  
Using the same data that was used by Beard, Brown was able 
to show that as many members of the "predator classes" 
opposed the Constitution as supported it.
  In his essay "On the Jewish Question," Marx had pointed 
out that progressive taxes can be used by the state as an 
effective means to abolish private property:  "when men 
strive to liberate themselves through political emancipation, 
the state can, and must, proceed to abolish and destroy 
religion; but only in the same way as it proceeds to abolish 
private property, by declaring a maximum, by confiscation, 
or by progressive taxation, or in the same way as it proceeds 
to abolish life, by the guillotine" (emphasis original).  Robert

  In 1927, the Progressive historian Vernon Parrington 
made this remarkable reinterpretation of the American 
Founding: "The substitution of 'pursuit of happiness' for 
'property' [in the Declaration of Independence] marks a 
complete break with the Whiggish doctrine of property 
rights that Locke had bequeathed to the English middle 
class, and the substitution of a broader sociological 
conception; and it was this substitution that gave to the 
document the note of idealism which was to make its appeal 
so perennially human and vital."  In the view of Parrington, 
the radical welfare state had been present in America's most 
authoritative documents from the very beginning!  Main

(According to the California Department of Personnel 
Administration, the state paid $430 in 1992 to Foundation 
Health for HMO coverage for an employee family of three. I 
added $20 because Foundation coverage is more restrictive 
than Medicare and MediCal.) Her Section 8 housing voucher 
was worth $565. (According to HUD, the average one-
bedroom apartment in Los Angeles costs $704 in rent; I 
estimate $60 in utilities for a total of $764; a Section 8 
certificate is worth $764 minus 30% of cash income: $663 X 
30% = $199, and 764 minus 199 is 565.) Thanks to Jennifer

* Editors' Note: The idea for this appendix arose during a 
November 1992 segment of the television interview show, 
"Meet the Press."  Its purpose, like that of Appendix A, is to 
demonstrate that Bible-based religious faith is perfectly 
compatible with the principles and traditions of American 
democracy.  Indeed, it is much more so than the facile 
moral relativism of modern liberals.

Dear Representative:

I encourage you to act in favor of the self-employed and 
small business owners by embracing reform of the status of 
independent contractors. I urge you to support and 
co-sponsor H.R. 1972, the "Independent Contractor Tax 
Simplification Act," introduced by Congressman Jon 
Cristensen (R-NE). 

H.R. 1972 simplifies the tax relationship between the 
business and the independent contractor by defining who is 
not an employee. 

This bill outlines clear, distinct criteria for those 
seeking to perform services as an independent contractor. 
As you are probably aware, independent contractors and small
business owners are presently forced to comply with the 
infamous 20-factor test - an ambiguous tool of the IRS which
lures independent contractors into a spiral of unnecessary 
legalese and expense. 

Many entrepreneurs and small business owners do not have the
time or resources to fight the 20-factor test, some of these 
job producers are forced to close their doors. One recent 
estimate that the IRS reclassified 439,000 independent 
contractors and collected $678 million in fines and back 
taxes over the past several years. 

Clearly there is an institutional bias for the IRS to 
reclassify independent contractors as employees. It would 
be intolerable if Congress failed to pursue reform of the 
20-factor test. 

Small businesses and entrepreneurs, the largest job creators
of our economy, should not be forced to comply with an 
unending string of arbitrary and outdated IRS rules. The 
20-factor test is a prime example of bad tax policy. I 
strongly support Congressman Christensen's bill and I ask 
you to do the same. 

Sincerely, 

</textarea>

Character Is Not an Issue (No, Of Course Not!)</CENTER>

<P>	 Let's not hear any more about &quot;character', okay? This country
is moving to a values neutral, non-judgmental consciousness in which such
outdated concepts are irrelevant. &quot;Character&quot; is just another
device by which the power elite seek to instill guilt in the masses and
bring everyone under the control of old fogies and their retrograde values
system.<BR>
	Character is not an issue. Character is not an issue. Character is not
an issue. Got it?<BR>
	What's with these politicians, anyway, trying to inject a concept like
character into a straightforward contest for votes? It's very negative.
Next, they'll be quoting a bunch of dead Greeks, like Heraclitus (&quot;Character
is destiny.&quot;) or Plutarch (&quot;Character is simply habit long continued.&quot;)
We're getting tired of it, burned out. It really brings people down. Talking
about character has become a character flaw itself, when you think about
it. Especially when candidates come right out and say that's what they're
doing. Give us a candidate who has good vibes and sympathetic body language.
If he's going to attack his opponent's character, he can do it on the sly
or get a surrogate.<BR>
	Besides, character doesn't matter.<BR>
	All right, maybe it matters a little bit. But, it has to take its place
at the end of a long line of considerations used to evaluate a candidate.
First, you need someone who is smart. And a riveting speaker. Good looks
help--a lot. No Abe Lincolns need apply. And then you want someone who says
things you agree with.<BR>
	Character? A poor runner up in any relationship. Maybe you are deciding
on a home remodeling contractor, or a banker, or a teacher (if you get a
choice), or a doctor (if you get a choice much longer), or a lawyer. Do
you want a good talker or character? Right: if it doesn't feel good, don't
do it! It's not how you play the game, but whether or not you win that counts.
If someone does something wrong, better to get past it, unless of course
we can sue.<BR>
	Character! Whose character, we want to know? The graybeards that prattle
about &quot;consequences,&quot; &quot;reliability,&quot; &quot;honor,&quot;
&quot;keeping your word&quot;? Talk about quaint; the other day one of them
used the word &quot;duty&quot;! Next, it will be &quot;honesty is the best
policy!&quot; Well, they have their values, we have ours. Haven't they ever
heard about the value of a good story? Or the value of getting away with
it? Their values are yesterday's, the old Eurocentric behavior control that
runs all the way back to Aristotle and the Bible. Well, isn't it time someone
had a kind word for Nicolo Machiavelli?<BR>
	Our hierarchy of character is just different. It is headed by &quot;compassion,&quot;
which is best expressed, for example, by helping  the less fortunate with
other people's money. Next comes &quot;tolerance,&quot; sometimes recognized
as indifference with a wan smile.<BR>
	The old guard are bogged down in particulars--this poor person, that family,
the town over there--while we expand our &quot;concern&quot; to include
whole groups and abstract categories of people; indeed, &quot;The People&quot;
as a whole. So who has the larger view? Their boring politicians talk about
this bill and that amendment; our sprightly leaders talk about  the symbolic
legislation that shows how they feel. The old guard say they care about
results. Well, we are more idealistic; we care about intentions.<BR>
	That's why, as I think I said, character is not an issue.<BR>
	&quot;Right? Wrong?&quot; Very good words, useful words; we use them all
the time, in fact. But let's be serious. Right and wrong depend on the situation--and
who they are used against. What's right and wrong also depends on public
opinion, or, more particularly, on the polls. And, lately, on focus groups
and on approval meters that people can hold in their lap to record their
instantaneous reactions to a speaker's every word. <BR>
	&quot;Leadership?&quot; That's very important, too. It involves finding
out what the folks in the focus group or studio audience believe (or say
they believe) and then advocating it.<BR>
	The old timers prefer principles to values, because they are more permanent,
and they think that human nature really doesn't change over time. We moderns
hope human nature does change because we are trying constantly to change
it. And we ignore principles and prefer values, because values can be anything
you want. They are merely an appendage of a constantly evolving  social
order, a reflection of the power structure at any given moment. As time
goes by, it is smart to abandon some values as they become  inconvenient.
Other values we just give others new meanings; for example, &quot;creative.&quot;
And other values we invent; for example, &quot;energetic.&quot;<BR>
	So character is not an issue.<BR>
	One candidate is a human weathervane? So? His opponent has changed his
mind on several occasions; who is he to talk?<BR>
	One candidate routinely breaks his word? So? His opponent failed to achieve
his whole agenda.<BR>
	They're all the same. It's all relative. Character is not an issue. Really,
it's not.<BR>
	Feel better now? Good. Feelings are what it's all about.<BR>

<H1>George Gilder as interviewed by Playboy Magazine in 1981 </H1>
<IMG SRC="warn-stripe-4.gif" WIDTH="450" HEIGHT="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"
ALIGN="BOTTOM"><BR>
<BR>
PB: In the recent past, your ideas and writings have enraged feminists and
political liberals. Today, those ideas seem to be among the guiding principles
of a changed political climate in Washington. We're going to ask you to
summarize the major themes of your books. But, for starters, just what is
it you believe in?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I believe in a free capitalist sys-tem in a larger cosmic order,
founded on absolute truth. I believe there are such things as absolute truths
and that society will necessarily reflect those truths, over time, in its
organization and behavior.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Tell us an absolute truth.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: An absolute truth I pro-pound in Wealth And Poverty is &quot;Give
and you will be given unto.&quot; To the extent people are willing to give
of themselves, to devote themselves to pursuits beyond their own immediate
cal-culations of self-interest, they tend to be more successful, to contribute
more to society and to receive more benefits themselves.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Then you don't see self-interest as the basis of economic progress?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: No. I don't think &quot;rational self-interest&quot; is the foundation
of capitalism or of economic growth under any circumstances. I think economic
growth is the result of human creativ-ity -- and creativity always comes
as a surprise to us. <BR>
<BR>
To the extent you plan for progress or growth, you will tend to exclude
the creative surprises on which growth and achievement depend. Surprises
mainly derive from the willingness of people to devote themselves to causes
beyond themselves -- to give of their work and wealth to create busi-nesses
or art, to project their energies beyond their own personal needs and perceptions.
This is a generous impulse. It leads to ever-widening circles of human sympathy.
<BR>
<BR>
A new project -- any new economic activity -- will succeed only to the extent
that it responds to the needs of others. The effort to fulfill the needs
of others is essential to important achievement.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Your altruistic notion of capi-talism certainly doesn't conform to the
conventional leftist view of the capital-ist as a predatory, money-grubbing,
self-interested individual.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That is a caricature of capitalism. Of course, in any society, there
are going to be self-interested, predatory, rapacious people -- and such
people have a lot of room to display their wares in a free society. But
this doesn't mean the essence of capitalism -- that part of it that accounts
for its unique success in creat-ing wealth -- is rapacious, predatory, or
self-interested. <BR>
<BR>
One of the themes of my book -- I'm talking about Wealth And Poverty --
is that this image doesn't work very well. When the leftist says that capitalists
are a bunch of creeps and predators, and the defender of capital-ism says,
&quot;Yes, but look what marvelous effects their freedom produces,&quot;
the left-ist has won the argument. The average per-son just won't believe
that, by giving maximum freedom to a bunch of creeps and predators, you
are going to produce a steadily improving human condition.<BR>
<BR>
And, as a result, the argument for moral-ity in human affairs has increasingly
shifted to the left. You find the Pope assuming, as a matter of course,
that socialism is a more generous and com-passionate way of organizing human
affairs.<BR>
<BR>
PB: And you?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I think that individuals who pur-sue only their narrow self-interest
are led, &quot;as by an invisible hand,&quot; toward an ever greater welfare
state. The truth is that people pursuing rational self-interest demand comfort
and security; they don't take the risks that result in growth and achievement.
And, without the risk-derived surprises of human creativity, the human race
is doomed. <BR>
<BR>
You need a willingness to give of your time and wealth and effort without
a predetermined reward. You hope for a reward in the future but, in capitalism,
that reward is not specified beforehand. You make your investment without
any assurance you will be commensurately repaid, let alone heavily rewarded.
<BR>
<BR>
This willing-ness to take risks is crucial to master the unpredictable and
unknown future.<BR>
<BR>
PB: And you believe that relates to how men perform in society, don't you?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes, because in a free society, men will be inclined to take such
risks. This is what men do when they're al-lowed to -- it's part of the
masculine character. Boys grow up and they want to perform. Their performances
are appraised by others. They fight to per-form well. And I think this desire
to perform, which has to some extent a sexual foundation, leads to the creative
activities so dramatically shown in capi-talist societies.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What is that sexual foundation? <BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Men have to perform in order to please women in a way that women
don't have to perform in order to please men. When you ask the average man
why he works, he'll pull out his wallet and show you a picture of his wife
and kids.<BR>
<BR>
PB: But don't men also work to impress other men -- their peers?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Sure, but that makes my point as well. Young men have to undergo
all kinds of initiation rites among their peers, in the outside world, in
order to qualify for manhood. Young girls don't have those rites. The changes
in their bodies qualify them for the crucial role of motherhood and the
survival of the tribe. There is a consistent differ-ence between this male
need for exter-nal performance to qualify for manhood and the degree to
which biological changes qualify women for their roles.<BR>
<BR>
PB: That was the controversial theme of one of your earlier books, wasn't
it?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Partly. The main thesis of Sexual Suicide is that sex roles are
the founda-tion of civilized society and any society that attempts to repress
them will at the same time subvert civilization. <BR>
I maintain that sex roles are founded on evolutionary experience, on the
mil-lions of years humans spent in hunter-gatherer societies; [and] that
they are further reaffirmed by the biological differences between the sexes,
which it takes a Ph.D. in physiology to ignore and which are evident to
all of us when we examine them. Further, I believe those differences are
affirmed by the dra-matically differing sexual experiences in men and women.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Namely?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Male experience revolves around copulation as the one purely sexual
activity. Women experience copulation as only one of a long series of sexual
experiences running from pregnancy to childbirth to breast-feeding and nurtur-ing
small children. Because women have this extended pattern of sexual experi-ences
that affirm them as women, they have great difficulty comprehending the
much more compulsive, aggressive and anxious male attitude toward the sex
act itself and toward sexual identity. Men have to earn their sexual identity
while, for women, it's part of their very being. <BR>
<BR>
As Margaret Mead wrote, ''Motherhood is a biological fact, while fatherhood
is a social invention.&quot; The father doesn't even have to be around when
the baby is born. He will be around, and be acknowledged as the fa-ther,
only to the extent the woman is willing to affirm his paternity -- to the
extent, in fact, that the woman is willing to forgo other sexual liaisons.
<BR>
This may be less true today than it was in the past. But certainly, through
the entire evolutionary experience of the race, fatherhood could be maintained
as a real institution only to the extent the woman was prevented from sleeping
around.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Sometimes called the double standard?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Right. I don't particularly want to defend the double standard as
a far-reaching moral principle, but it certainly does derive from the very
differing consequences of promiscuity for men and for women.<BR>
<BR>
PB: We'll get down to cases on that topic but, for now, what was your purpose
in writing Sexual Suicide?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I wrote that book because I saw that, until you understood the difference
between the sexes, you couldn't under-stand the effects of government welfare
policy on the poor. It was obvious to me how, to the extent that welfare
programs usurped the male role of provider, it would be impossible to maintain
intact families. And, as long as intact families were not maintained, it
would be impos-sible for the wide range of welfare recipients ever to escape
from the wel-fare society.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What was the theme of your subsequent book?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: The concept for my subsequent book, Naked Nomads, came to me dur-ing
a debate, when my opponent was talking about how women earn less money,
how they have all these signs of oppression and victimization -- where-upon
it occurred to me that single men could be presented in exactly the same
terms. Single men earn about the same amount of money as single women of
the same age and qualifications. They are enormously more prone to every
sort of disease and affliction than any other large group in the society.
And they commit something like 90% of all the violent crimes. It seemed
to me the statistics about single men had real significance for an appraisal
of the dif-ferent roles of the sexes.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Single women didn't manifest those tendencies?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That's right. Single women are virtually as healthy and as well
paid as married women, by most indices, while married men earn almost twice
as much money as single men of the same age and qualifications. The obvious
question that arose about this data was whether it was merely that single
men were losers, and therefore couldn't get married, or whether failure
to get married led to a pattern of behavior that fostered disease and criminality.
<BR>
<BR>
I pored through lots of evidence on this point and discovered that widowed
men and divorced men showed a pattern of problems almost identical to those
displayed by single men of the same age and qualifications. Widowed men
didn't choose to be wid-owed, and divorced men may or may not have chosen
to be divorced, but my thesis was that single men are less civi-lized, if
you will. They have more short-term perspectives, because they lack the
links to women and children that lend them a sense of the future -- a kind
of physical embodiment of the future in their lives. Single men, lacking
these long-term dimensions, are left in the very short-term compulsive circuits
of male sexuality. They follow the same patterns of tension and release
that are characteristic of the male sexual experi-ence. Man's link to the
future passes through the woman's womb. Men be-come more stable and less
compulsive to the extent that they have links to chil-dren that carry them
into the future. I thought the statistics about single men -- whether bachelors,
widowers or divorced -- confirmed that proposition.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You seem to be saying that the success of the human race depends on
men's becoming what used to be called -- mostly in bars and locker rooms
-- &quot;pussy-whipped.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: This is one of the great ironies of male chauvinism. Men always
use such terms to the extent they are ex-cluded from the long-term patterns
of family life that women tend to foster. Men asserting male superiority
feel compelled to put down women. The sort of male-chauvinist idiom you
find at bars or in all-male groups, particu-larly in the military, really
reflects an inner sense of the profound dependency of men on women for the
most important of human experiences: Procreation and nurture.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What was your book Visible Man about?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Visible Man began with the title Sam Beau. It was based on two years
of interviews with ghetto blacks. My thesis was that the old &quot;Sambo&quot;
image -- the Stepin Fetchit character that was the previous destructive
clich&eacute; about black life -- had been supplanted on the streets by
a new &quot;Sam Beau&quot; image -- of the swashbuckling street stud, who
didn't work and who spent all his time pursuing a succession of welfare
mothers and engaging in criminal activity. <BR>
<BR>
The pimp image was strikingly manifest in ghetto culture, and my observation
was that this image is just as destructive to people who succumb to it as
the previous, self-indulgent Sambo image. This conduct also resembled the
male behavior in various societies I studied in anthropology, in which the
constructive male role of provider is not pursued for one reason or another.
In the ghetto, the chief reason the male-provider role is unavailable is
that it's performed so much better by the gov-ernment through the welfare
state. <BR>
<BR>
Those were the ideas that underlay the narrative of Visible Man -- which
is, in fact, a nonfiction novel, examining the welfare culture and what
it does to men: How it destroys men and drives them into increasingly futile
virility rites -- fighting and crime and drugs.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You're not suggesting that this is exclusively a black problem, are
you?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Not at all. It s not a special black problem. It's only a black
problem because the welfare culture has been propagated most successfully
in the in-ner cities, through the War on Poverty, which focused on blacks
in the ghetto. The same sort of patterns can also be found in hippie culture,
where you have the violent flower-child phenomenon in a social order that
was just as corrupting as the street culture of blacks in the ghetto itself.
<BR>
<BR>
Middle-class black society is very much like middle-class white society.
Black families are no more prone to breakdown than are white families. And
white families break down just as much when subjected to this kind of welfare
state as black families do. <BR>
<BR>
It just happens that, through the Outreach programs of the War on Poverty,
a much higher proportion of the black poor was induced to accept the welfare
culture.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Do you find no redeeming features in the War on Poverty? You seem to
indict the program totally.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Pretty much. It just didn't do any good. The various well-intentioned
programs might have done some good, if they hadn't been accompanied by a
vast increase in welfare benefits that just ravaged the families of the
sup-posed beneficiaries. The crucial thing that happened during that period
-- that overwhelmed every positive initiative of the War on Poverty -- was
the doubling of the number of female-headed families among blacks. This
meant almost a complete breakdown of the black family in the ghetto itself,
to the extent that 95% of black welfare families lack fathers.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What is the theme of your latest book?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Wealth And Poverty brings all these social themes together with
an economic vision. Present in Wealth And Poverty is the idea that the competitive
activity of men, attempting to support their families, is a crucial impulse
of economic growth. <BR>
<BR>
I also stress the criti-cal importance of freedom as a practical necessity
for economic progress in an uncertain and unpredictable world. The creative
breakthroughs I talked about earlier -- the surprises that throughout human
history have been most important in creating wealth and solving the problems
of scarcity -- have never been predicted. They tend to emerge in defiance
of the assumptions of the experts. <BR>
<BR>
Creativity is always unexpected. After all, if you could predict it, you
could prescribe it. If it were predictable, you wouldn't need it. And, because
existing knowledge and ex-isting resources are always inadequate to an extended
future, human success is necessarily dependent on novelty, on surprise,
on creativity. You have to have a huge outpouring of human creativity in
order to launch the few unpredict-able inventions that can transform all
human life. <BR>
<BR>
Consider the vast number of small businesses that are conceived against
the relatively tiny number that are actually launched. When you realize
that two-thirds of these will fail within five years, you understand how
the process is not a matter of very profound rational planning.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What specific message in Wealth And Poverty do you think the Reagan
Administration finds so compelling?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, one of them is that the fun-damental problem of American society
today is that more than half the people in the country now face marginal
tax rates above 50% on an additional dollar of earnings.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Explain what you mean by the marginal tax rate.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: The marginal tax rate is the tax you pay on the next dollar you
earn, beyond your current earnings. It's what you don't take home from your
next dol-lar of income. That's the marginal tax rate and, as I say, it has
now reached a level over 50% for most Americans, which includes all the
most productive Americans, who really determine the directions of our economic
activity.<BR>
<BR>
It also includes welfare recipients. They have very high marginal tax rates.
If a welfare mother goes out and earns an additional dollar, she'll have
to forgo a dollar of her current income -- plus some leisure time. In effect,
she faces a margin-al tax rate of more than 100%. The same is true for people
who are much better off, who face preposterous rates on interest earned
from savings -- which the government quaintly calls &quot;unearned income.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The tax rates on such income are ostensibly 70%, but they end up, after
adjusting for inflation, attaining real levels much over 100% -- often 200%
or even 300%.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Would you elaborate on that?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: If you put $100 into a savings account, you'll be lucky to get 10%
interest over a year's time. But, during that year, your principal has been
reduced by 10% inflation; so, at the end of the year, you break even. The
government doesn't see it that way. It says you've made $10 just by leav-ing
your money in the bank -- and it wants seven of them. So you started with
$100 and wind up, in effect, with $93. Here you're being taxed on losses.
<BR>
<BR>
Whether you're a welfare mother or a capitalist, this situation means you
have a greater incentive to hide a dollar of existing income than to earn
an addi-tional dollar. And that is the perfect formula for a tax system
that, on the margin, loses more revenue than it col-lects. It loses partly
by driving people into the underground economy, which consists of cash exchanges
and barter -- you know, where the accountant does the lawyer's taxes and
the lawyer does the accountant's divorce. Barter arrange-ments like that
are emerging increasingly in today's highly taxed economy. <BR>
<BR>
Tax revenue is also lost because people are driven into overseas tax havens,
or out of productive forms of investment and into postage stamps or boxcars
or rare coins or Rembrandts -- [and] all other non--financial assets whose
sole advantage is that they escape taxation most of the time.<BR>
<BR>
PB: But tax cuts at the margin will primarily benefit the rich. That used
to be called the &quot;trickle-down&quot; school of economics: Give money
to the rich and some of it will eventually trickle down to the poor. Is
that what supply-side eco-nomics is all about?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: No. Supply-side economics is the opposite of the trickle-down theory.
We believe that wealth is created by production -- at any level. That's
why you don't find supply-side theorists advocating tax cuts chiefly for
business. We focus on personal income tax cuts, because we be-lieve wealth
begins with individuals, not with institutions. Wealth is the product of
individual creativity.<BR>
<BR>
PB: There are certainly other visions of how economies are structured.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: To be sure. An alternate approach to taxation, which has dominated
in the United States in recent years and which still dominates in Sweden
and England, is the idea that you can have flourishing capitalism by subsidizing
big corporations while bitterly punishing anybody who tries to make money
outside the existing corporate structure. You subsidize institutional savings
that are channeled back into major corporations or into govern-ment bonds,
but you strongly prevent anyone from accumulating savings on his own that
he can dispose of as he wishes.<BR>
 <BR>
The problem with this approach is that, overwhelmingly, it is disposable
personal savings that make the economy go -- by financing the proliferation
of small busi-nesses, which are the source of ferment and growth. Supply-siders
focus on personal activity as the source of wealth. <BR>
<BR>
As an example, we believe immi-grants are one of the most important forces
in economic growth. They come to the country with no wealth, they generate
wealth and stimulate the lower middle class to greater efforts. This causes
wealth not to trickle down but really to surge up through the whole system.
It starts as much at the bottom as at the top. There's no trickle-down notion
at all in our ideal.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You talk about stimulating small businesses, but isn't most of the wealth
in this country in -- and there-fore aren't most jobs dependent on -- large
corporations?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Since the mid-fifties, the num-ber of small-business starts [annually]
has risen from 93,000 to nearly 500,000. There are a total of 15,000,000
small businesses in this country that create about 80% of new jobs. In fact,
during the '70s, companies with fewer than 250 employees created more than
90% of new jobs, while corporations in the Fortune top 1000 created no new
net employment at all.<BR>
 <BR>
There's no evidence that innovations come from big bureaucracies. Perhaps
the most impor-tant innovation of our time -- the micro-processor, the computer
on a chip -- was developed by a firm with 12 employees.<BR>
<BR>
PB: No innovations from bureauc-racies? NASA, so we hear repeatedly, gave
us Teflon. Bell Labs gave us the transistor.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Sure, but when you talk about Bell Labs, you find they're not prepared
to exploit the developments -- William Shockley left Bell Labs alter inventing
the transistor to start his own firm, when it became clear &quot;Ma Bell&quot;
didn't know how to use it. Similarly, Shockley didn't see how the transistor
could be transformed into a microprocessor, so some of his employees split
off from him to form yet another small business. <BR>
<BR>
As to NASA, that was primarily a case of mobilizing existing technology,
and the payoff was hardly worth the huge ex-pense. Statistics show the yield
of innovations from small businesses is about 20 times greater than that
from large corporations or subsidized research and development.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Is the Kemp/Roth tax bill -- which would reduce rates 30% over three
years -- a direct attempt to resolve the problem of excessive taxes at the
margin?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. The Kemp/Roth bill was the original supply-side proposal.<BR>
<BR>
PB: The objection one hears most frequently is that the Kemp/Roth tax cuts
are certain to be inflationary, be-cause they would create a situation in
which too much money is chasing too few goods.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: But we don't focus on money. We focus on the creation of goods.
And we think that the problem of too much money is best addressed by enhancing
incentive to create more goods. There-fore, the way to respond to inflation
is not to diminish the amount of money people have but, rather, to enhance
the number of goods and services they produce. The best way to enhance their
incentives to create more goods and services is to reduce the tax rates
on traditional income. This is an excellent reason for supporting the Kemp/Roth
concept. <BR>
<BR>
PB: Would Kemp/Roth also stim-ulate savings?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: It would greatly stimulate savings, because a high marginal tax
rate deters savings twice: It first deters you from earning those additional
dollars you're most likely to save, and it then deters you from saving them
by taxing the interest return from savings at the highest possible rates.
So, when you cut marginal tax rates, you impart a double stimulus to savings
but only a single stimulus to consumption. <BR>
<BR>
Increased sav-ings don't enhance aggregate demand, even in the Keynesian
scheme. So, to the degree that a cut in marginal tax rates stimulates savings,
it has an anti-inflationary effect. If we expand savings by a greater amount
than we increase the federal deficit, we will actually reduce inflationary
pressures.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Has that been proved?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Absolutely. This is why the Japa-nese and Germans and Swiss have
been able to run deficits two or three times as large as ours -- as a proportion
of gross national product -- without having inflationary results nearly
as serious. <BR>
<BR>
PB: How did the ideas of supply--side economics develop?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: The essential ideas of supply-side economics arose in response to
the tri-umph of Keynesian economics, which is essentially based on the proposition
that purchasing power drives the economy. In the Keynesian view, it's dollars
in people's pockets -- aggregate demand -- that make the economy go. It
doesn't really matter very much how the dollars get into people's pockets.
<BR>
As a matter of fact, over the years, the Keynesian theory has reached the
conclusion that the best way to put dollars into people's pockets is through
government spending. As individuals in the economy, we're pretty good aggregate-demanders,
but sometimes we like to save money rather than spend it. In Keynesian terms,
savings is a &quot;leakage&quot; from the flow of aggregate demand that
makes the economy run.<BR>
<BR>
PB: That's the demand side of the equation.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. The demand-siders are really interested in monetary aggregates
-- that's their central concern. Aggregate demand consists of money in consumers'
pockets, money available for investment in the pockets of businessmen and
money in the government's pocket.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Are there other areas in which you think our national priorities are
wrong?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. We do not adequately re-ward human creativity and initiative,
which is really the most valuable force in the economy. The Democrats increasingly,
by focusing on investment tax credits and benefits for buildings and machines,
have ignored the most valuable capital in the system -- human capital. Even
when they acknowledge the value of human capital, they see it as manufac-tured
in schools, rather than as a product of individual incentives, creativity
and effort.<BR>
<BR>
PB: At what tax rate do you think diminishing returns set in?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I believe that any tax rate over 35% costs more than it's worth.
In other words, it damages total economic activity by a greater extent than
it in-creases government revenues.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Can that be proved, or is it just your feeling?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: It s a feeling, but it's an observa-tion that I think most people
will affirm. I think your own observations will con-firm that when the government
has taken more than 35% of addition-al revenues, your activity changes.
To an increasing degree, people begin to consider ways of avoiding taxation,
and they place less stress on earning more money. I would be willing to
defend that proposition. Asian countries that have lower marginal rates
of taxation have been growing much more rapidly than any other countries
in the world. Japan, in particular, has rates of margin-al taxation less
than half as high as ours, on comparable incomes.<BR>
<BR>
PB: But aren't Japan's tax rates supposed to be just as high and just as
steep as ours?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: They are, but the top rate, which is about 70%, like ours, applies
only to incomes over $396,000 in Japan. The top German rate of 56% applies
only to incomes over $50,000. In the United States, any ''unearned in-come&quot;
earned by those whose salary is over $50,000 is taxed at the 70% rate. We
have vastly more punishing marginal rates of taxation than any of the Asian
countries that have been grow-ing faster than any other countries in the
world since the Second World War.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Some observers attribute those rates of growth to cultural or societal
differences.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That's ridiculous. The Chinese in Hong Kong and Singapore and Taiwan
have very low rates of taxation. The highest rate in Hong Kong is 15%. People
there work terribly hard and ter-ribly productively. As I say, they have
the fastest growing economies in the world. Put those same Chinese in a
Communist system and you have an extraordinarily stagnant and ineffective
economic ar-rangement, even though the people prob-ably work just as hard
in mainland China -- maybe harder.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What about the analyses -- done at Harvard and MIT among other places
-- that show that people won't work hard enough to produce the increased
revenues that supply-siders predict?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: They miss the point entirely. Supply-siders don't predict that people
will work 30% harder as a result of a 30% reduction in tax rates. They merely
predict that people will work 30% more efficiently. They'll tend to focus
their efforts more on taxable activity and less on untaxed activity. These
changes are not directly measurable at all by the kinds of analysis that
all those learned economists have been sponsoring.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Do most other Western nations have payroll withholding taxes as we do?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. Most nations deduct social-security taxes at the paycheck level.
We have a greater stress on income taxation. A higher proportion of our
revenue comes from income-taxation than in other countries, except England,
Sweden and Denmark. The other countries large-ly focus on value-added taxes,
which are a kind of national sales taxes. They're collected on the &quot;value
added&quot; at each stage of manufacturing and marketing.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Isn't the VAT widely alleged to be a very regressive tax, meaning that
it falls more heavily on the poor than on the rich?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: It's alleged to be a regressive tax, but it can be adjusted, as
it is in most countries, so that it's greater on luxury goods than it is
on necessities. Most real necessities, such as food, are excluded from value-added
taxation.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Would you support it as an alternative to an income tax?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I think it's preferable to an in-come tax, but I wouldn't support
it unless it were accompanied by a much more drastic reduction in the income
tax. In other words, I don't support it as a supplement to existing forms
of taxa-tion, and so far this is the only way it has been advocated. <BR>
Recall that the in-come tax was initially enacted as a tem-porary expedient
because it was such an efficient and affirmative way to raise funds. Somebody
suggested a 10% ceiling on the income tax, and the argu-ment was made that
if you impose a 10% ceiling, the tax would tend to rise all the way up to
10%. So it was decided not to have such a high ceiling, lest we achieve
this confiscatory rate of taxation. <BR>
<BR>
I would want to be sure that the value-added tax weren't just piled on top
of all the other kinds of taxation in the United States.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Is there any condition under which people will willingly pay taxes?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Sure. People are willing to pay taxes when they get something in
return. You'll pay taxes to support the police, roads, libraries, hospitals
-- all legitimate services that governments offer in various constituencies.
It's only when people begin believing that the government is taking more
than it provides that tax revolts occur. <BR>
<BR>
Jude Wanniski, one of the founders of the new school of supply-side economics
-- as opposed to the classical school, which was started by Jean Baptiste
Say and Adam Smith -- points out that in Stalingrad, during World War Two,
people were happily taxed at more than 100% in order to hold off the enemy.
They allowed themselves nearly to starve, in order to provide food to continue
the defense effort. If people really believe that government services are
worth what they cost, they'll forgo income to support them. <BR>
<BR>
But, under cur-rent circumstances, most people think the government charges
more than it delivers, so they reasonably reduce their activity and try
to avoid taxation.<BR>
<BR>
PB: If you were President and you had an amenable Congress, what sort of
tax program would you put through?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I'd like income taxation at a flat rate of 20% or so, depending
on the revenue needs.<BR>
PB: No progressive rates?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Not for me. I don't think pro-gressivity does any good. It hurts
the poor.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Please explain.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Progressive tax rates don't redis-tribute income; they redistribute
tax-payers. They move wealthy people out of the productive economy into
offshore tax havens and unproductive tax shel-ters. Progressive tax rates
have had this effect most dramatically where they are steepest, in Sweden
and England, where anybody who makes any money immedi-ately leaves.<BR>
 <BR>
Bjorn Borg lives in Monte Carlo. The Beatles spread to the four corners
of the earth. All sorts of wealthy British have emigrated to the U. S. to
avoid the preposterous British tax rates. For many years, they had a 98%
rate on unearned income. The cream of the British economy was redistributed
by ill-conceived taxes to Beverly Hills and Bermuda and Malta and Spain
-- any-where but in productive work to contrib-ute to the wealth and welfare
of the poorer British citizen who stayed home.<BR>
<BR>
PB: So you advocate an across-the-board flat tax rate on incomes.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That is the ideal system. To get there, my general focus is on cutting
personal-income-tax rates, abolishing the distinction between earned and
un-earned income, and then cutting the remaining tax rates regularly.<BR>
<BR>
PB: That is more or less what Ron-ald Reagan has advocated. Do you see Reagan
as an effective President?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. He's just been quite re-markable. Take, for example, his ap-proach
to the Office of Management and Budget. The usual idea is to appoint a banker
friend or somebody who has a lot of experience in accounting. It's always
been regarded as a neutral office, to which are appointed people who are
adept at managing numbers -- as if gov-ernment really consists of the mobiliza-tion
of competing armies of statistics. <BR>
<BR>
And Reagan didn't. In designating Da-vid Stockman, he appointed not only
a brilliant policy analyst but one who had supported John Connally during
the campaign, who was regarded as alto-gether too bumptious and aggressive
by many of his congressional associates and who was opposed by many other
people on Reagan's staff at the time. <BR>
<BR>
Also, Stockman was a leader in a very controversial movement in economics,
and Reagan gave him the central role in his Administration. That's a bold
act by a President.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What is your vision of the future of our economy?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I am very bullish, very optimistic about the future of the American
econ-omy. I think that the gloom that has beset us in recent years originates
from three chief assumptions: That we are running out of energy, that we
have some basic productivity problems that can't be resolved and that capitalism
was somehow maladjusted to the modern age, so that the various totalitarian
systems would necessarily prevail.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Do you dissent from those assumptions?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. In all three cases, I see major new developments of the highest
prom-ise. I see huge new finds of natural gas, which, even though they haven't
all been proved to date, nonetheless, collec-tively suggest that today we
have a wider variety of energy sources available or in view than ever before
in human history. <BR>
<BR>
I see that the productivity problem is rapidly being resolved by the applica-tion
of new technology in the service industries. All these word-processors,
computer terminals and telecommunica-tions devices are being installed and
adopted by ever more offices, but they have yet to be mastered and fully
integrated into efficient systems. As we move into the '80s, I think the
result will be major and dramatic advances in productivity. <BR>
<BR>
The third point is the astonishing triumph of capitalism in the past decade.
When I went to Harvard, and later worked on the Council on Foreign Re-lations,
the general consensus was that the Maoist experiment in China was exerting
this potent magnetism on the overseas Chinese on the edge of the mainland.
Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong and even Japan would slowly be induced to adopt
Communist approaches and techniques. <BR>
<BR>
Well, today, all the magnetism has flowed in the other direction. Who would
believe that lit-tle outposts like Hong Kong and Singapore and Taiwan would
be shap-ing the future of mainland China? That the leaders on the mainland
are consult-ing the overseas Chinese on how to adopt capitalist techniques
and regen-erate the economy? This is an incredible change, a development
that has the greatest portent for the future.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Given the supply-siders' con-cern for individual freedom, do they take
issue with government regulation?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Most supply-siders emerged from a system in which Government had
a huge role already. Contemporary supply--side economics is a post-welfare-state
phenomenon. We accept the existence of government and the need for regula-tion
in many areas. We don't oppose regulation except where costs are much greater
than benefits.<BR>
 <BR>
I like the example of rules for a basketball game. You need a certain number
of rules in order to have a basketball game at all. Without rules about
dribbling and shooting, without boundaries, you wouldn't have a basketball
game that was fun to play or entertaining to watch. However, if you begin
to prescribe rules about the exact inflection at which players are allowed
to release their shots, or how high they can jump from different loca-tions
on the floor, or just how fast they can run under prescribed circumstances,
at a certain point the rules tend to become counterproductive. <BR>
<BR>
I think our current problem is that we've gone be-yond the point where rules
promote order and productivity to a point where they are a new form of disorder.
We earlier discovered that soap was a form of pollution; now we're finding
that rules are a new form of unruliness.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You're not talking about a re-turn to the 19th century, then?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Not at all. We believe de-regulation is eminently desirable, not
because we oppose a clean environment or a safe workplace or support the
desirability of poisoning people with un-tested new pharmaceuticals, but
because we believe the current laws are far more complex than understood,
and that the bureaucracies they've spawned are too large and too poorly
organized to achieve any beneficial effect.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Would you give us an example?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: An obvious example is the enor-mous effort to eliminate auto-pollutants,
requiring catalytic converters and other expensive devices. No one has yet
shown a relationship between auto-pollutants and any disease. It has yet
to be demon-strated that the catalytic converters eliminate pollutants any
more damaging than the ones they emit. [EPA disputes this, claiming that
a relationship be-tween certain types of respiratory and cardiovascular
diseases and auto-pollut-ants has, in fact, been demonstrated. Sim-ilarly,
the EPA claims that emittants from catalytic converters are not harmful.]
<BR>
<BR>
Enormous new expense was imposed on our auto industry without any evidence
of beneficial results. One of the obvious effects was the willingness of
people to buy vans and pickups and retain old automobiles much longer than
they did in the past. People are using more in-efficient, more pollutant
vehicles to an increasing degree.<BR>
<BR>
PB: So you would not restrict tech-nological progress at the expense of
environmental concerns?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That's rarely the choice. Throughout history, tech-nological progress
has entailed the replacement of heavy and potentially damaging machinery
with more efficient and less environmentally destructive means of production.
The obvious development is from the steam engine to the silicon chip. Current
microprocessors the size of a fly have more computing power than the early
computers that would fill up a gym-nasium with tubes and wires. <BR>
<BR>
In gen-eral, economic progress has tended to result in smaller, lighter,
more efficient, less pollutant equipment. To hold back economic progress
in the name of re-ducing environmental damage is entire-ly counterproductive.
This does not mean that intelligent regulation should not be promulgated
in order to transmit to businesses knowledge that's not trans-mitted by
the marketplace.<BR>
<BR>
PB: For example, the marketplace wouldn't resolve the problem of Amer-ican
industrial pollution that descends on Canada as acid rain, would it?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: No. The marketplace doesn't ordinarily place a value on air, or
on water, or on land beyond its borders. In cases such as acid rain, there
may be times when simple Government regula-tions are preferable to some
purer form of market action.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Why do so many well-inten-tioned government programs wind up achieving
precisely the opposite of their planned results?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: This is the phenomenon that I call moral hazards of liberalism.
Moral hazards is an insurance term. It refers to the potentially negative
results of an insurance policy. The moral hazard of fire insurance is arson.
When the insur-ance on a building exceeds its value, spontaneous combustion
often results. There's nothing the insurance company can do about it except
to reduce the payoff.<BR>
<BR>
PB: How does that relate to public policy?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: The moral hazard of unemploy-ment insurance is unemployment. When
government-paid unemployment bene-fits -- plus leisure time -- become greater
than the benefits of work, unemploy-ment increases. The moral hazard of
welfare tends to be broken families and increased poverty -- because, when
welfare benefits become greater than the bene-fits of maintaining an intact
family with an employed breadwinner, then more and more families will tend
to break up and the breadwinner will go to the streets -- into crime and
the underground economy. <BR>
<BR>
And, when the man is gone, the chances of that family's escaping poverty
plummet. Even though its income in-creases, the only way to escape poverty
ultimately is to work. If the government provides the income and the father
leaves the family, the family is still im-poverished, even if its income
exceeds the official government poverty level. With no real hope for the
future, with great difficulty disciplining its children, particularly its
boys, the family will live a slovenly and disorganized existence that will
shock any social worker who ex-amines it. <BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, the welfare benefits this family receives, combined with the
food stamps, the housing sub-sidies and all the other programs that have
been enacted for the poor, are far greater than the total incomes of middle-class
people 20 years ago.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You're saying that the real income of welfare families today is higher
than the middle-class wage was in 1960. Is that accounting for inflation?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That includes inflation. Welfare benefits today are worth on the
average between $15,000 and $20,000 a year. That would be equivalent to
an income of about $7,000 a year in 1960, which was the median income then.
We mustn't forget that welfare is, in a sense, an insurance scheme. It's
insurance for people who, presumably, through no fault of their own or through
some con-catenation of events, fail to earn enough money to support themselves.
The con-cept is of insurance. <BR>
But when the bene-fits rise beyond the insurance level, they foster the
very disasters that are being insured against. In other words, they create
incentives for unemployment and family breakdown. And that's wily the Reagan
concept of welfare reform, at least as it applied in California, is misconceived.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Why?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: In California, they seem to think you can raise the benefits to
any level. Reagan raised them by 43% for the alleged &quot;truly needy,&quot;
while, at the same time, he increased the welfare po-lice to investigate
fraud and abuse. Once again, this is a case of ignoring the supply-side
rule, which is that people change their behavior to re-spond to incentives.
<BR>
<BR>
You can't increase welfare benefits 43% without rad-ically changing the
pattern of incentives confronting poor people. You can kick a lot of people
off the rolls for a few years, as Reagan did in California, but soon enough
they readjust their lives to do what the government prescribes. If government
projects a concept of true neediness, the poor will quickly convert themselves
to the &quot;truly needy.&quot; You want disability? All right, I'll give
you disability. You want a mother with three kids who doesn't know who the
father is? Fine, I forget Daddy's name. Right now it just totally escaped
my mind. I don't know who the hell he is.<BR>
<BR>
The point is, welfare applicants don't even have to adjust their lives,
they just have to adjust their behavior in the welfare office. My book Visible
Man documents that proposition fully. I went to the welfare office many
times with various of the characters in the book. They would all ask the
clerks, &quot;How do you want these forms filled out?&quot; The forms are
something totally alien to them. They can't find any correspond-ence between
their lives and those forms, so they simply find out what they're supposed
to say. &quot;What do you want me to say? What am I supposed to say?&quot;
And then they say it.<BR>
<BR>
PB: It seems reasonably certain that Reagan as President has no intention
of increasing welfare benefits nationally. Do you think it's a reasonable
prospect to consider reducing them?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Not really. The Reagan program is not significantly reducing welfare
benefits. There are some changes in eligibility, but in essence they are
leav-ing these programs intact. I think the Reagan Administration will be
resistant to further expansion in these programs, while at the same time
heavily devoted to expanding opportunities in the real economy. The result
will be that as time passes, the attractions of work in the productive economy
will rise, while the attractions of the welfare culture will decline. Welfare
benefits will di-minish, not in absolute terms or in real purchasing power
but in relation to the steadily increasing wages in a growing economy.<BR>
<BR>
PLAYBOY: On what basis do you make that projection?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: In California, after Proposition 13, which essentially reduced marginal
taxation at the state level, everybody predicted unemployment and stagna-tion.
Of all the leading economists, only Arthur Laffer accurately predicted the
outcome. He predicted that the California economy would greatly expand and
that people would voluntarily leave government service to take advantage
of improving opportunities in the private sector. And that's just what happened.
There was no great need to fire govern-ment workers, because they left voluntarily.
<BR>
<BR>
Just about every prediction made by aggregate analysis on the basis of the
California tax cut was wrong. Invari-ably, the supply-side analysis was
vindi-cated. On balance, the impact on the incentives of individuals easily
overrode the impact on the aggregate movements of funds.<BR>
<BR>
PB: But California is a special case.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. It's a special case. It s just one example. Another example
is Puerto Rico, where Governor Carlos Romero Barcelo finally decided to
dismantle an egregiously ineffective tax system that a deputation of eminent
economists from Yale had recommended as the only way to increase its equality
of income dis-tribution. As a result, Puerto Rico had preposterously high
income-tax rates, about 20% higher than our rates in the United States.
Barcelo, after con-sulting with Laffer and Wanniski, started cutting these
taxes and removing the surcharges. Every year, after each tax cut, income
expanded across the whole island by a far greater margin than the tax cut,
and revenues to the government increased. <BR>
<BR>
It's the same story: Increase individual incentive, and you promote economic
growth.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Let's talk about economic in-centives for young people. Would you advocate
loosening minimum-wage re-strictions to promote teenage employment?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: The minimum-wage law is one of thousands of laws that don't do any
good. But it's so frequently ignored that it's not as significant as many
people imagine. The problem in the ghetto is not the minimum wage. The problem
is welfare benefits that are collectively worth more than twice the minimum
wage.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Nonetheless, conventional con-servative wisdom holds that teenage unemployment
is largely caused by minimum-wage barriers.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, I don't believe that. I think that teenage unemployment is
ex-acerbated by the minimum wage -- and I don't support the minimum wage.
But I do not accept the idea that our current problems of teenage unemploy-ment
in the inner cities are caused by the minimum-wage requirements. They're
caused by the breakdown of the black family and the demoralization of teenage
boys who have never seen what it means to work to earn a living.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Are you saying the minimum wage is ineffective?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: In the ghetto, it certainly is. No-body goes into ghetto communities
to enforce the minimum wage. Nobody pays taxes in those areas. Half the
retail transactions in ghetto establishments are off the books. I dissent
from the whole idea that we have a rigorously enforced small-business economy
in the ghetto in which rules like the minimum wage have any substantial
effect. <BR>
Don't mis-understand me. It's a negative factor -- one more obstacle to
youth employment. <BR>
<BR>
PB: You seem to speak with some authority.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, I spent two years researching Visible Man, which concerns
young people in the ghetto.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Did you live in the ghetto?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: On the edge of it, in Albany. Also, I did hundreds of interviews
with black teenagers in New York City through my association on the board
of the Vocational Foundation.<BR>
<BR>
PB: And on the basis of all that, do you feel that you're better able to
make observations about how a ghetto economy works?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, honestly, more than the vast majority of sociological experts
on black poverty, I really did spend three years examining very little else.
I inter-viewed literally hundreds of people at great length in all sorts
of contexts in Albany. Then I spent some weeks in Greenville, South Carolina,
interview-ing the same people and their families down there. And I also
did a lot in New York City. So I really did have a good perspective on the
whole problem.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What did you learn?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I confirmed all my preconcep-tions. I had read all the previous
anthropological literature on the subject, so that my prejudices weren't
entirely groundless. And, on the basis of thisprevious literature, I developed
the themes of Sexual Suicide, which really originated with my ghetto analysis.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You're talking about the work for which the National Organization for
Women awarded you its Pig of the Year award. How did it begin?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Before I answer, I have to tell you that I succeeded Norman Mailer
in receiving that award and, since it hasn't been awarded since, I think
I've retired the trophy.<BR>
<BR>
PB: We're impressed.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: It began with my support of President Nixon's veto of the Javits-/Mondale
child-development bill, which would have created a vast system of federal
day-care centers all across the country. I was editor of The Ripon Forum,
the magazine of the Ripon Soci-ety, a liberal Republican group. I wrote
an editorial opposing these day-care centers, and a bunch of leading Ripon
ladies went on the Today Show to pro-test my vicious polemics and to try
to get me fired. <BR>
<BR>
Then I went on the TV program The Advocates. This particular program was
a debate on day care, and I was brought in to speak for the oppo-sition.
The other people on the show were all Congressmen and professors and experts
on the subject. After I was through, a mass of women in the audi-ence rushed
forward to attack me. Since for decades I'd been seeking a way to arouse
the passionate interests of wom-en, I realized that I'd found my tech-nique,
and it worked for years afterward. And it was then, as I stood there reveling
in my good fortune, that I conceived the idea of writing Sexual Suicide.<BR>
<BR>
PB: We were wondering when you'd explain how you came to write about both
money and sex.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: When I was single, I was pre-occupied with sex. Now that I'm an
elder statesman, I've moved on to a more dignified concern: Preoccupation
with money.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Staying with the former pre-occupation, wasn't it your statement that
you didn't believe in equal pay for equal work that first truly enraged
feminists?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That's not what I said. I do believe in equal pay for equal work.
But I don't believe any government program is more likely to encourage this
than the workings of the marketplace. I've seen no evidence that quotas
or gov-ernment programs have fostered it in the slightest degree. The usual
victims of quotas or affirmative-action programs are men with few credentials,
little ed-ucation and large families to support. Upper-class feminists all
believe that any man who makes it just by working harder than a college-educated
feminist must be an evil oppressor.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Hold it. In the first place, you're generalizing about feminists by
depicting them as upper-class elitists. <BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Most feminists are upper-class women. They may call themselves mid-dle
class, but, in fact, a great many of them are in the top 10% of earners.
or they're graduate students or other exalted figures in our system. And
a woman who is a Radcliffe graduate, a relative dilettante in the work force,
often resents the fact that lower-class men can earn more money than she
does by working hard -- often at two jobs -- by putting in overtime and
organizing their lives well.<BR>
<BR>
When you look at the evidence that's available on earnings of the two sexes,
you find that the only group that earns far more than its education and
creden-tials would justify is married men with large families and a high-school
educa-tion or less. My point is that if you know any of these men, you know
they earn every dollar. They deserve more money for the work they do. At
least they deserve it more than some graduate student who wants a &quot;fulfilling&quot;
job in a foundation-sponsored cultural-uplift program. <BR>
<BR>
To the extent the gov-ernment enacts equal pay for equal work, it will mean
more stress on such factors as race and sex, and even more on credentials
and qualifications, while relying less on work effort and ingenuity and
drive and ambition -- those very fac-tors that every close analysis shows
are most important in increasing economic productivity. What many feminists
think will be a fairer system will actually be most unfair: It will favor
the upper classes, who can buy credentials, over the lower classes, who
must compete by working harder and more aggressively.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You re certainly overlooking the Norma Raes of this country, the millions
of working-class women who would agree with some of the aims of the feminist
movement.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, the leaders are all upper--class, and I think many of their
argu-ments apply only to that class -- in other words, that women should
be freer to enter the work force to broaden their horizons and do something
more &quot;ful-filling.&quot; For those women who have to work out of economic
necessity, the op-portunities are there.<BR>
<BR>
PB: So, to you, the political aims of the women's movement are merely an
expression of upper-class lobbying.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That's the real clash -- between lower-class, hard-working men without
a lot of elegant refinements and upper-class women who want their credentials
instantly converted into high salaries. And when I talk about &quot;high
salaries,&quot; I mean the upper 10%. Remem-ber that, in this country, anyone
who earns more than $35,000 is in the top 10%, and when you inquire of these
oppressed feminists, you often find they are earning salaries at that level
-- or believe they should be -- when, in fact, such salaries are the object
of the most intense competition. Very few men -- only the most aggressive,
excep-tional and lucky men -- can achieve that kind of income.<BR>
<BR>
I just think the whole women's move-ment is economically illiterate. It
wants to increase government power in a most arbitrary, destructive way,
in the most sensitive area of the nation's econ-omy -- personnel policy.
That's the area where the most subjective and human of factors are involved,
hundreds of them, and they cannot possibly be re-duced to the sorts of statistical
findings a federal judge or a panel of equal-rights advocates would deem
relevant. To have these decisions made by judges and panelists is ridiculous.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Still, wouldn't you acknowl-edge the fact that many of the inequities
the feminist movement battled against were real?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Actually, it was the feminist movement that was never real. It was
all based on fantasy. Women will never pursue careers with the same determina-tion
and drive that men do. Some will, and those some will rise to very high
levels, as indeed they do now. <BR>
<BR>
But, as to the notion that the women's movement has liberated women from
their &quot;traditional&quot; roles, there's just no evidence that women
are working any harder. Women are 11 times as likely to leave the work force
as men are. [According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. by 1980, women
were only five times as likely to leave the work force.] A couple of years
ago, there was great outrage that female doctors were earning less than
male doctors -- until it was determined that female doctors saw 40% few-er
patients than male doctors.<BR>
<BR>
Wherever you look, if you examine the facts, you discover that women do
not engage themselves in the work force with the same ambition and drive
that men exhibit. Until they do, they won't earn equal money. And they never
will, because they have more options than men -- namely, they can withdraw
from the workforce when they wish to, in order to raise children, a fully
respect-able role.<BR>
The idea that large numbers of women are going to make earning money their
top priority misunderstands the difference between the sexes. Men have to
earn money to be sexual beings -- providers, husbands, fathers. Women have
a full range of choices. You can say that, actually, the woman is superior
because her sexuality ranges through pregnancy, the nurture of children
and all sorts of events of vast importance to society. Men have to do only
one thing.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Wasn't the whole idea behind women's liberation a freeing of both sexes
-- for women to be able to compete equally in the marketplace and for men
to share in the nurturing of children?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Obviously, the men can't share fully in the nurturing process, and
if you go back to Margaret Mead's quote about motherhood's being a biological
fact and fatherhood a cultural inven-tion, comparing the two is crazy. It's
just plain quixotic to have a society depend on the cultural invention of
a father's &quot;sharing&quot; in the same way it depends or the biological
fact of bear-ing a child in one's body and nurturing it at one's breast.<BR>
Regardless of how desirable it may be for men to participate deeply in the
experience of child-raising, these are not characteristic male roles. Masculinity
is not defined through relations with chil-dren: By bottle-feeding a baby,
you don't affirm your sense of yourself as a man. That's why it's the men
who are already secure in their masculinity who are best able to adapt to
the feminist program. Men who aren't fulfilling themselves as providers
have to fund their masculinity in some other ways. <BR>
<BR>
Among the most conspicuous ways, in these years of liberation, are violence
and drinking and other vicarious macho experiences. In other words, what
the feminists attack as male callousness is a product of masculine insecurity
rather than confidence. Feminists increase this insecurity, and thus increase
the pro-pensity of men to assert their masculin-ity in violent and destructive
ways -- and to disparage women as well. <BR>
<BR>
I mean, if you're confident of your own masculin-ity, you can acknowledge
that woman in m any ways are superior to men and are indispensable to male
happiness and fulfillment.<BR>
<BR>
PB: But if what you say is true, aren't you having it both ways? You say
that men who aren't successful at being men are the ones who resist the
women's movement, who disparage women and that men who are successful at
be-ing good providers, at being men, are the ones who can best adapt to
it. If the aims of the women's movement were based on &quot;fantasy,&quot;
why would the most successful men support it?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER Not all do. But those who do are doing so out of chivalry. It's fascinating
to me that so many men who come from traditional backgrounds, who went to
all-male prep schools, through an all-male military, who probably never
worked for a women or gave much thought to female liberation, suddenly find
themselves mouthing feminist clich&eacute;s -- mainly because their wives
were captivated by an essay by Gloria Steinhem. It's just chivalry; they
don't take it seriously. <BR>
<BR>
Ronald Reagan opposes the ERA, but he felt he should give equal time to
his daughter Maureen on the issue. So she uses radio time that he, Ronald
Reagan, earned to attack his position. He wouldn't have done this on any
other issue. It shows he isn't serious about it. It's typical male-chauvinist
behavior: In-dulge the little lady and allow her to be a feminist.<BR>
<BR>
PB: That's interesting. You've ef-fectively called your friend Ronald Reagan
a male chauvinist.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well -- yes. These are the real male chauvinists. The man who is
a suc-cessful lawyer, or the president of a corporation, or the President
of the United States is secure in his manhood, so he allows the little woman
her frivolous ideologies. He may even say he's a feminist himself, because
he doesn't take these concerns very seriously. This shows disdain for women,
not respect. <BR>
Male in-dulgence of feminism is the new male chauvinism. It says, &quot;I
can't be worried by anything these women do; let them do it. I can't be
threatened.&quot; Well, a man who's serious understands he can be threatened
by women. That, in fact, he is more dependent on women than women are on
him. And that a movement like the women's movement can threaten him -- and
society. <BR>
Because what does feminism liberate? It chiefly liber-ates men. It liberates
men from the responsibilities of monogamous marriage, which is the foundation
of civilized life.<BR>
<BR>
PB: How do you square monogamy with your earlier explanation of the double
standard of sexuality?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I said that male sexuality is com-pulsive and short-lived, in contrast
to the women's sexuality, but I feel it needs to be domesticated, in a sense,
by women. Otherwise, as statistics show, it impels a very difficult life
for the single male. <BR>
<BR>
Marriage leads to the subordina-tion of compulsive -- and promiscuous --
male sexual experience to the long-term maternal horizons of female sexuality.
It links men to the future through chil-dren. So when the feminists insist
that female sexuality is the same as that of men, it's just erroneous, as
any man could testify, and fundamentally hostile to women.<BR>
<BR>
The idea that women have the same kind of compulsive, single-minded sexual
potential that men have simply isn't borne out by any of the evidence. They're
superior sexually, because they<BR>
have more options and a broader range of sexuality, but it's not the same.
They can have as much copulatory sexual ex-perience as men, but they can
also forgo it more easily.<BR>
<BR>
PB: So you wouldn't admit that the pill and other contraception have had
any effect in changing women's sexual behavior? Plenty of studies indicate
they have.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Oh, sure, the pill has had an ef-fect, but the argument that forgoing
motherhood in favor of a promiscuous sex life has enriched women is a very
dubious proposition. <BR>
<BR>
In any case, the pill would have increased only the very narrow activity
of copulation, and the notion that all of sex can be defined as copulation
is a male-chauvinist idea. To the extent that women accommodate themselves
to that idea, they deny them-selves a far greater sexual potential. You
find a lot of women who have accepted this now expressing their unhappiness,
which the feminists then take as further proof of their oppression. Female
sex-uality is much more extensive and ful-filling than the male version,
because it's linked to other things more important -- continuity and nurturing.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Much of your argument is based on women's childbearing role. But what
about women who (A) choose not to have children or (B) want to enter the
work force before or after rais-ing children?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: The vast majority of women still do bear children. Of the women
who enter the work force, some will succeed extraordinarily. But, in general,
women won't enter the work force in the same spirit as men. Motherhood is
still the central role for women in all societies, and it certainly is central
to those young, dynamic years when families are formed and careers are launched.
<BR>
<BR>
Women have a more important role altogether in the human race, but there
is one area where men will tend to excel -- and that's in the workplace.
Men will tend to com-pete harder at earning money, because that's what determines
their relationship to family and their access to children. Because they
always have other options, women won't work as hard as men -- they generally
don't take outdoor work, for example, where the money can be better. And,
far from accepting the fact that there's been this vast change, I think
that women don't work as hard today as they did in the past. I grew up in
a farming community, and when America was dominated by farming, women bore
children and worked long-er hours at their chores and in the fields -- contributing
greatly to the econ-omy -- than many do today at careers.<BR>
<BR>
The reason that women don't general-ly win the &quot;rat race&quot; is that
they have more enriching experiences to choose from centered on the family.
Men have to perform outside the family to re-ceive the benefits from it
-- even to per-form sexually. The sex act itself depends on male confidence,
and that's why all societies ascribe special importance to male achievements,
even if, objectively, they're not as important as women's achievements.<BR>
<BR>
PB: But you still haven't addressed our question. If the pill has liberated
women from the automatic fear of preg-nancy, and if women want to compete
in the work force outside of that relatively short childbearing period,
why shouldn't the opportunities and poten-tial be the same as for men?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, first, I think the pill mainly liberated men, allowing them
to find more opportunities for their short-term, compulsive sexuality. I
don't see that it enriched women's lives. <BR>
But, as to the work opportunities, they're there -- for men and women alike.
Women aren't held back. My argument is that to the extent we encourage,
by legislation or otherwise, forced equality in the work-place, we undermine
the strength of so-ciety. <BR>
<BR>
Incidentally, on the question of postponing motherhood, I've been in-volved
with some groups of older Ameri-cans, and overwhelmingly, the response of
those who waited until their 30s to have kids was that they missed having
grandchildren. Those who had children earlier said that one of the single
most enriching experiences of their lives was the enjoyment of their grandchildren.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You surely have more compli-cated thoughts about contraception. Where
do you stand on abortion?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: It's a bad form of birth control. When it's made freely available,
it tends to become the dominant form of birth control, as it has in many
East European countries and in Sweden. Half of all Swedish pregnancies end
in abortion, and one third of all births are illegitimate. [According to
U.N. statistics, fewer than one quarter of Swedish pregnancies end in abortion.]
Abortion also can in-crease problems of sterility. <BR>
<BR>
But I know there are all sorts of tragic problems associated with the issue,
and I frankly have no easy solution or response. I certainly don't oppose
other forms of birth control.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Do you find many intelligent women agreeing with your views?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Antifeminist women tend to be more intelligent and interesting than
feminist women, because they aren't con-formists. Feminists in general succumb
to the fashion that prevails among the American intelligentsia, while it
takes real intellectual courage and conviction to resist this juggernaut,
which most of the media have fueled and supported. <BR>
<BR>
Women like Phyllis Schlafly and her supporters understand the crucial role
of women in society and the impor-tance of maintaining sex roles in order
to have a happy and stable society. They know that it's the differences
between the sexes that lead to love and fulfill-ment and that attempts to
overcome those differences lead to impotence, ste-rility and a tedious kind
of sensuality.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Let's pursue this topic of sex-ual differences a bit more. You've re-peatedly
singled out aggressiveness in males as one of the factors that make them
better competitors in the work force. And in Sexual Suicide, you wrote,
&quot;Boys are more aggressive because of how they are born, not how they
are raised.&quot; Where's your proof of that?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Biology isn't the only factor, but it's certainly true that men
are more aggressive in every society known to anthropology. As a matter
of fact, two leading feminist scholars, Carol Jacklin and Eleanor Maccoby
of Stanford, wrote a voluminous study called Psychology Of Sex Differences.
In it, they concluded<BR>
that the greater aggressiveness of men is biologically determined -- in
all societies and in animal studies. The studies were made in infancy, before
socialization could be a factor. <BR>
I also maintained in Sexual Suicide that, beyond being a biological fact,
it was also a psychological reality, because the sex act itself requires
greater aggres-siveness by the man. Finally, it's an evolutionary experience
-- because if most of our history has been in hunting societies -- males
have depended for their very survival on aggressive kinds of hunting activities,
while women have always been responsible for nurturing small children, which
is a less aggressive responsibility.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Haven't there been societies in which the women have done not only the
raising of children but most of thehunting and food gathering as well?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Sure, there have been societies where men strutted around and pre-tended
that killing a giraffe every six months was the key to the survival of the
tribe, while the women did all the work. But those were irrational soci-eties
that didn't do very well. You can channel natural male aggressiveness into
roles that are unproductive for the community, and even exalt those roles,
but ordinarily the community won't survive.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What about the evidence of matriarchal societies?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: There is no such evidence. Steven Goldberg wrote a book, The Inevitabili-ty
Of Patriarchy, which Margaret Mead described as &quot;flawless in its presentation
of the data&quot; and which refuted every claim ever made that there had
been a matriarchic society. [Margaret Mead actually wrote, &quot;The reporting
of his sources cannot be faulted... It is when he puts his pieces together...to
form his 'theory,' that he ceases to be persua-sive.&quot;] In each case
that a feminist had described a matriarchy, Goldberg would go back to the
original studies cited by the feminist and show that authority in that particular
society was, in fact, vested with the men. <BR>
<BR>
PB: You're saying that there has never been a successful society in which
equality of the sexes has been achieved. What about Israel and China?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Good examples. A lot has been written about both countries and most
of the evidence bears out my position. <BR>
<BR>
In Israel, there was a real attempt at reversing the sexual roles within
the kibbutzim, and it was found that the women themselves took the lead
in re-fusing the powers ascribed to them un-der that system. Over time,
they refused to go out into the fields and cultivate if it meant having
to pack their kids off to the day-care center. Interestingly, never in the
history of the kibbutz experi-ments did men actually take on child-rearing
roles, nor did women ever take positions of authority, as the political
ideology had prescribed. As a result, today the kibbutz has the most strongly
differentiated sex roles in all of Israeli society. [Other studies on the
Israeli kibbutz dispute the fact that no women took positions of authority.]<BR>
<BR>
China was devoted to some kind of anthill egalitarianism, but when a study
was made of 12,000 people listed by the Communist Party as leaders, only
two -- Mrs. Mao and Mrs. Chou -- were women. And both of those, of course,
made it as a result of being married to their husbands. There just isn't
any evidence that the Chinese overcame sexual-role differ-ences except insofar
as they abolished individuality altogether.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You don't think very much of the women's movement, do you?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, I don't think it's done us any good, but I wouldn't exaggerate
the impact of it. In general, I am not a sexual liberationist. As I've said,
I think marriage and family are the foundations of civilized life, and anything
that tends to be hostile to the formation of fami-lies -- or receptive to
their breakup -- tends to increase social problems and decrease productivity.<BR>
<BR>
For instance, I think the feminist movement probably hurts young boys. In
the cases I've cited in which the man leaves home, families headed by females
tend to make it more difficult for boys to grow up into responsible and
loving adults. That leads to increasing distress among women about the quality
and attitudes of men they know -- and the circle closes in on itself. Yet
the response of some of these women is to advo-cate yet more women's liberation,
when this process is the cause of the problem rather than the solution to
it.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You'd better explain what you mean when you say that the feminist movement
harms young boys.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: It goes back to what I said first got me involved in my critique
of femi-nism -- my studies of welfare programs that had the effect of usurping
the father's provider role in the ghetto. The response of feminism to this
miscon-ceived government policy was to pro-pose that welfare mothers be
provided with work and that their children be provided with a massive system
of day--care centers. It struck me that having deprived black families of
fathers, the feminists were proceeding to take away the mothers as well.
<BR>
<BR>
Sometimes I would get the impression, after reading about the proposed solutions,
that to a fem-inist, the only truly liberated individual would be an orphan
at a government-funded day-care center. It just seemed crazy to me.<BR>
<BR>
The real problem, obviously, was to get the fathers back into their homes
as providers. The women just couldn't cope alone with their sons. The boys
were out on the street, finding their masculinity in gangs and various macho
displays, while the mothers were struggling to maintain some kind of order
in the home. <BR>
<BR>
Then the feminists came along with their grand solution: Take the kids away
and stash them in day-care centers and dispatch the mothers to jobs of various
kinds, such as sweeping offices or scrubbing toilets or whatever kinds of
work are available to welfare mothers in America's big cities. And this
was liberation! <BR>
<BR>
The feminists could write won-derful poetry about the stimulating environments
ingenious civil servants could create for the children, but the re-ality
of most day-care programs is a lot less attractive, especially when the
child goes home to a parent exhausted after a nine-hour job. There has been
a lot written by feminists about how good a job can be for both child and
mother, how she goes home invigorated and can be a better parent to the
child. This shows a complete incomprehension of how tiring and difficult
most jobs are.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What about the case of women who, very simply, want to work?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Of course, there are many women in the market place doing terribly
valua-ble work who are making major con-tributions to society. That's one
of the options those women have. But many women are working chiefly because
they have to, because the economy isn't offer-ing sufficient opportunities
for their husbands, and they're certainly not ex-periencing any kind of
liberation.<BR>
<BR>
PB: We think we sense a closing of your particular circle here, from wom-en's
liberation to men's predicament to your prescription for economic solutions.
<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Right. Liberation for many wom-en would be the right to return to
the home and devote themselves fully to domestic life. If things go as I
hope, I foresee a booming economy, and one that will be very favorable for
the American family. <BR>
<BR>
In the end, you can't separate economics from sex or faith or love or any
of the other wellsprings of human behavior. The mathematical models of conventional
economic the-ory -- like the unisex models of femi-nism -- leave out everything
that makes life interesting and makes the economy go. Again, you have to
get back to what's in people's heads -- and that's things like love and
ambition, desire and faith, sex and money -- not aggregate demand or undifferentiated
&quot;human beings.&quot; I nev-er met a human being. The people I know
are men and women, and that's the way I like it.<BR>

From the automobile to the television set, technological breakthroughs often
have demanded legislative breakthroughs. This is an era of profound and
far reaching breakthroughs in wireless communications. I congratulate Senator
Pressler for rising to this technological challenge by providing the necessary
legislative breakthrough: a set of proposals for spectrum reform that will
go far toward opening the way to dramatic advances in spectrum technology.
I fervently support his five major initiatives--spectrum privatization,
spectrum management cooperatives, spectrum bloc grants to states, federal
spectrum convergence under the FCC, and most important of all, flexible
frequency sharing, as opposed to exclusive frequency assignments.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A crucial complement to the Pressler proposals is is the conversion of broadcasters--now
endowed as spectrum hoarders and analog polluters--into more efficient and
profitable users of cable coax and the limitless infrared spectrum of fiber
optics. As Nicholas Negroponte has been pointing out for the last six years
or more, in his famous proposal for a &quot;Negroponte Switch,&quot; broadcasters
should moue onto wires and voice telephony into the air<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Paul Baran formerly at IBM and now at Sun observed in his keynote speech
to the Marconi Centennial Symposium in Italy, &quot;The major spectrum hog
[and spectrum problems is analog broadcast TV transmission.&quot; Senator
Dole also targeted this problem in a bold speech tow months ago. Congress
could give every existing broadcaster free access to cable at a cost at
least $70 billion lower than the cost of letting broadcast tycoons have
exclusive control of 485 megahertz of prime microwave frequencies.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Furthermore, Congress should bring to a screaming halt the oppressive new
telecom tax of federal spectrum auctions. If you subsidize something, you
get more ot it. If you tax it, you get less. The US government is now punitively
taxing telecom innovation. As Eli Noam of Columbia puts it, &quot;We can
agree that governments should not subsidize telecommunications under an
industrial policy. We also should agree that government should not extract
huge new taxes from innovative telecom companies.' As Noam points out, this
policy will surely backfire when other countries around the world begin
taxing American telecom companies for their use <I>of </I>the so called
&quot;natural resource&quot; <I>of </I>spectrum. Sure enough, the UN is
now contemplating this global &quot;resource&quot; recently discovered and
sanctified by the taxers and spenders of the US government.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Senators, the air is not a &quot;resource.&quot; It is the environment.
The value of electromagnetic frequencies is entirely created out of thin
air by the inventors of new radio and computer technology. Your job is to
prevent it from being polluted by obsolete high powered smokestack emissions
from analog<BR>
transmitters.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All existing spectrum policies have become obsolete as a result of radical
new technological breakthroughs in wireless telecopy Converging with advances
in cheap and powerful computer technology, radio is now returning to a pivotal
role in technological progress. At the very moment of a fa W ish fixation
with the radio frequency spectrum--aroused by the FCC's auctions of some
200 megahertz worth of licenses for new cellular Personal Communications
Services (PCS) plus an amazing proposed giveaway to the world's leading
analog polluters--new radio technologies are devastating all the most basic
assumptions of spectrum regulation. At a time when the world is about to
take to information superhighways in the sky, plied by pollution free data-planes,
the FCC is in danger of building a legal infrastructure and protectionist
program for information smokestack industries and diesel locomotives.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Even the language used in describing the auction betrays its misconceptions.
Spectrum is described as &quot;beachfront property&quot; and the auction
as a &quot;land rush.&quot; The basic assumption is that spectrum is like
real estate; many people cannot use the same frequencies at once. Radios
are assumed to be infectious, high powered, and blind; each needs to be
quarantined in its own spectrum slot.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
New technologies from companies such as Steinbrecher Inc. in Burlington,
Massachusetts, Airnet in Melbourne, Florida, Motorola in Schaumberg, Ill.,
Arraycomm in San Jose, and Qualcomm Inc. in San Diego overthrow this paradigm.
Not only can multiple radios operate at non-interfering levels below the
threshold of noise but they can also see the signals of other users and
moue to avoid them. If appropriately handled, these technologies can render
spectrum not scarce but abundant. These developments make it retrograde
to assign exclusive spectrum rights to anyone or to foster technologies
that require exclusivity. Except for the nearly infinite expanse of contiguous
waves, spectrum no longer shows any of the features of beachfront property.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Think of it this way. In the field of spectrum technology, we are in the
midst of a transition resembling the moue from railroads to cars early this
century. A railroad is hard wired and circuit switched; only one train can
use a particular stretch of tracks at one time. Railroads have to be run
and governed by a centralized authority, overseeing use of a particular
network of connected tracks.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A highway, by contrast can accommodate thousands of automobiles, trucks,
campers, bikes, motorbikes, and vans at one time, each under its own power
and control. What makes the superhighway function without top down control?
Essentially, it's smart antenna technology: human eyes.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Human eyes are smart antennas with a bandwidth of some 300 trillion hertz
or cycles per second of spectrum. Human eyes scan the road and assure that
cars do not collide with other vehicles, interfere with them, or drive them
off the road. With every car responsible for its own domain, a superhighway
can accommodate scores of thousands of vehicles at once, each going to its
own destination.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A receiving antenna is like a pair of human eyes: it converts photons into
electrons, electromagnetic waves into electrical energy. The difference
until recently is that eyes are smart: they have 10 billion neurons integrating
and interpreting their electromagnetic signals. Until recently , radios
were dumb and blind. Thus you needed a separate radio for every frequency
channel or road, and you needed to keep the way completely clear of other
vehicles. Broadcasters for example, use obsolete analog signals that require
megawatts of power yet cannot endure the slightest interference; they require
a 50 decibel signal to noise ratio, or 100 thousand to one. Thus these blind
analog radios have to control exclusively their spectrum. Similarly cellular
phones today in the US usually need exclusive use of wide spans of spectrum
and can only reuse frequencies in one out of seven cells.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Companies using obsolete blind radio technology--and experts in the old
analog systems--haue persuaded the government to sell them exclusive licenses
to spectrum. Think of them as railroad magnates prohibiting the use of cars.
You can t have cars on the road, they say, cars will crash into each other,
drive each other off the road. They will speed; it will be chaos. Sound
familiar? I have spent hours at the FCC listening to government spectrum
experts make similar arguments about the chaos and collisions that could
result from a new spectrum regime that follows the inspiration of Senator
Pressler's proposals: his flexible frequency, frequency overlay, unlicensed
frequency, and cooperative frequency management plans. All imply the sharing
of spectrum like the sharing of superhighways or even the sharing of the
air.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I'm sure that if the FCC had to assign an exclusive span of air for each
person to breathe, we would all be gagging and wheezing today. We would
be holding urgent Senatorial sessions to contemplate the crisis of scarce
oxygen. People talk about spectrum as beachfront property., If the FCC controlled
beach sand, we would all be running out of silicon for our microchips.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For a different model, contemplate the 40 million cordless phones in the
US, all sharing the same tiny sliver of spectrum with burglar alarms and
other appliances without significant interference. Consider the scores of
thousands of unlicensed user of the ISM bands (Industrial, Scientific, and
Medical), using spread spectrum technology to share frequencies. Then consider
the rapidly advancing technology of smart radios--radios with antennas like
eyes that can scan broad ranges of frequencies and use whatever lanes or
slots are open on the highway.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Digital radios can function with a signal to noise ratio under 10 to one--ten
thousand times lower than analog broadcasts. These smart digital radios
change wireless from a radio business to a computer business, and that makes
all the difference. With smart radios, it makes no more sense to award exclusive
frequencies than to award exclusive rights to the air.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Smart radios--often called software radios or broadband digital radios--are
the hottest single technology in wireless. The leading technical publication
in the field, EEE Communications magazine, recently devoted an entire issue
to them, noting in the editor's introduction that several articles had been
withdrawn at the last minute because they contained crucial business secrets.
Donald Cox of Stanford University--formerly Bellcore's inventor of PCS technology--predicts
that over the next five years these technologies will reduce the average
capital cost of a cellular customer from $5555 to $14. Last month the pioneering
smart radio company--Steinbrecher Corporation of Burlington, Mass.--was
bought for $93 million by the fastest growing major telecommunications equipment
supplier, Tellabs.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Over the next five years, smart radio equipment will completely obsolete
all the assumptions that currently govern spectrum policy. Broadband basestations
that can handle a large variety of frequencies, protocols, and modulation
schemes will proliferate around the world, allowing bandwidth on demand
for internet access anywhere and for cheap new wireless local loops.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Even the technical difference between wires and air will largely disappear
with the emergence of space division multiple access technology which can
isolate a single call in a cell. Both wires and air will be seen as channels
for photons. Some photons will run at infrared frequencies down fibers with
limitless bandwidth over long distances, and some photons will link through
the air to local base stations at microwave frequencies for mobility. Senator
Pressler's visionary proposals are a crucial first step to this new of digital
wireless communications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
By contrast, the FCC is fostering a real estate paradigm for the spectrum.
You buy or lease spectrum as you lease a spread of land. Once you have your
licence, you can use it anyway you want as long as you don't unduly disturb
the neighbors. You rent a stretch of beach and build a wall.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With these technologies available, however, the FCC should not be giving
exclusive rights to anyone who makes the highest bid. Instead, it should
be imposing a heavy burden of proof on any service provider with blind or
high powered systems who maintains that he cannot operate without an exclusive
license, who wants to build on the beach and keep everyone else out of the
surf. In coming years, it may even be appropriate for the FCC to make all
the proponents of Time Division Multiple Access, whether in the American
or European GSM systems, explain why the government should wall off spectrum
for them at a time when exclusivity is no longer needed or desirable. The
wireless systems of the future will offer bandwidth on demand and send their
packets wherever there is room.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At the same time that new technologies make hash of the need to auction
off exclusive licenses, Qualcomm, Arraycomm, Steinbrecher, and other companies
also radically attack the very notion of spectrum scarcity on which the
auction is based. Smart radios make it possible to manufacture new spectrum
nearly at will. By putting a multiprotocol-basestation on every telephone
pole and down every alley and in every elevator shaft, the cellular industry
can exponentially multiply the total number of calls that can be handled.
Dropping in price at the pace of Moore's Law, these minicells can operate
at 900 megahertz or six gigahertz just as well as at the 2 gigahertz range
being auctioned by the government. It is as if Reed Hundt is auctioning
off beachfront property, with a long list of codicils and regulations and
restrictive covenants, while the tide pours in around him and creates new
surf everywhere.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Still more important in view of the coming auction, this capability of smart
radios joins spread spectrum in allowing the use of huge spans of spectrum
that are ostensibly occupied by other users. The smart radio can range through
the gigahertz reserves of the military and intelligence services, UHF television
and microwave, and direct usage to the many fallow regions. Together with
spread spectrum, which allows as many as 32 users in a particular frequency
band and cell at once, and which permits 100 percent frequency reuse (all
frequencies can be used in every cell), the broadband digital radio system
changes the very nature of spectrum &quot;ownership&quot; or renal.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Unrestricted to a single band or range of frequencies, smart radios can
reach from the kilohertz to the high gigahertz and go to any unoccupied
territory. As such radios become the dominant technology, the notion of
spectrum assignments allotted in 4887 specific shards becomes a technological
absurdity.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In his speech at the radio centennial, Paul Baran summed it up: &quot;There
really is no fundamental reason for a shortage of UHF spectrum...the frequency
shortage is caused by thinking solely in terms of dumb transmitters and
dumb receivers. With today's smart electronics, even occupied frequencies
could be used...The present regulatory mentality tends to think in terms
of a centralized control structure, reminiscent of the old Soviet economy,&quot;
where everything was scarce.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We should instead adopt the Internet model that is currently reshaping the
entire landscape of information technology. The Internet accomodated a 1600
percent rise in traffic in 1995 without breaking down. In the Internet,
there is no central node, no hierarchy of control, only a heterarchical
system with minimal housekeeping functions at the center. A similar system
for spectrum could emerge under Senator Pressler's visionary proposals for
a new world of wireless progress.<BR>

Gingrich plan puts focus on Clinton
</FONT><HR WIDTH=50%>By Donald Lambro<BR><font size=1>
The Washington Times</font><HR WIDTH=30%></center>

<BR><DD>Republican leaders, decrying "the looming Clinton
recession," are crafting a legislative agenda for the campaign
year that focuses on economic growth, jobs, incomes and some
issues favored by social conservatives.
<BR><DD>GOP leaders on
Feb. 23 also began fine-tuning their message in an attempt to
better explain how their party's proposed budget and tax cuts
can help average working-class voters worried about a
declining economy.
<BR><DD>House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who
has been keeping a low profile during the early rounds of the
Republican primary fights, laid out the new message Feb. 23 in
a memorandum to GOP leaders that sought to ally his party
with growing voter anxiety and anger over job losses and
stagnant or falling incomes.
<BR><DD>"In the first caucus and
primary votes of 1996, the American electorate reminds us
clearly that the failing Clinton economy has short-changed
American workers and their families. Republicans understand
this anger," Mr. Gingrich said.
<BR><DD>Last year Republicans
passed tax and spending cuts to "allow families to keep more
of their hard-earned income" and to spur economic expansion
and job creation, he said. But in the end these and other
reforms to strengthen the economy "died at the tip of Bill
Clinton's veto pen."
<BR><DD>Haley Barbour, Republican National
Committee chairman, also attacked Mr. Clinton's economic
record Feb. 23, saying the "looming Clinton recession" was the
result of the president's decision to raise taxes in 1993 and
increase government regulations. "No wonder wages are
stagnant -- the government got your pay raise. It's no surprise
there are fewer jobs; the government is soaking up most of the
money that could be used for job creation," he said in a speech
to the Conservative Political Action Conference.
<BR><DD>"The
growing Clinton recession -- with its wage stagnation and
economic insecurity -- is the result of Clinton's high-tax,
big-government policies," he said.
<BR><DD>The combined
RNC-House Republican attacks are part of a new, coordinated
strategy to maintain a drumbeat of attacks on the White House
and the Democrats "from now until the November elections,"
GOP officials said.
<BR><DD>"Our message got lost last year in
the budget negotiations. We did not effectively explain what
our reforms would mean to average Americans. We need to
make sure that doesn't happen this year," said a senior House
GOP official.
<BR><DD>Mr. Gingrich's broadside came at a time of
increasing division and debate among the GOP presidential
candidates over the party's message, and increasing evidence
that GOP primary voters are responding to the economic
anxiety issues that Pat Buchanan and Steve Forbes have raised
in their campaigns.
<BR><DD>The Gingrich memorandum came as
welcome news to his GOP colleagues in the House, who have
been urging him to speak out much more forcefully against Mr.
Clinton and the Democrats to counter the primary fights that
have been dividing his party.
<BR><DD>"I'm glad he's speaking
out, finally. We need his voice in this debate about where we're
going," said Rep. Helen Chenoweth, a freshman Republican from
Idaho.
<BR><DD>Mr. Gingrich and his chief deputies continued to
work late last month on a new legislative strategy and a
stronger marketing plan aimed at highlighting policy
differences with Mr. Clinton in the campaign, especially
economic policy.
<BR><DD>His party's case for tax cuts and
fiscal reforms to spur economic growth was bolstered Feb. 23
by new government statistics showing the economy grew by
only 0.9 percent during the last three months of 1995. He also
acknowledged that the GOP has not done a good job of
connecting with the economic concerns of middle-class
families.
<BR><DD>"We must be prepared to communicate our
response to legitimate voter anger in a clearer and more
forceful manner than we have done so far," the speaker
said.
<BR><DD>"We are with the American people now and will
produce legislation that addresses their concerns throughout
the spring and summer."
<BR><DD>GOP officials who attended Mr.
Gingrich's strategy meetings last month said they were
focusing their agenda for the rest of the year on issues that
would "get the economy moving," create jobs and improve
incomes. Most of the agenda will be drawn from the "Contract
With America," including tax and budget cuts, curbs on
entitlements, and regulatory relief for
businesses.
<BR><DD>Rep. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, the GOP's
chief deputy whip, was assigned to develop a "market-driven"
health care reform plan that will include medical savings
accounts and provisions to allow workers to keep their health
care protection when they change jobs.
<BR><DD>"We want to
make sure that middle-class Americans can get health
insurance if they lose their job. We'll probably bring it up
before this summer," Mr. Hastert said.

Dear Congressman:


As a small business owner and taxpayer, I strongly encourage
you to support efforts to repeal the Davis-Bacon Act.  This
outdated, discriminatory act has cost hard working taxpayers
billions, and inhibited the opportunities of small
construction firms and unskilled (mostly minority) workers.

Davis-Bacon is an example of what's wrong with Washington.
This anti-market law has no place in our government, yet
lawmakers elected for change have been unable to repeal it.
I am shocked to hear that some Members of Congress actually
want to "reform" Davis-Bacon by expanding it.

When the Republicans pulled Davis-Bacon out of the budget
reconciliation bill they sent a signal to voters.  Such
activity told the public the majority party wasn't willing
to aggressively support bold regulatory and fiscal reform.
The confidence I had in Congress since the '94 election is
being eroded by the failures of this Congress to enact bold
reforms.  This failure only benefits special interests at
the expense of all taxpayers and our system of free
enterprise.

As a member of the Small Business Survival Committee, I
understand the implications of keeping a law like Davis-
Bacon on the books.  Time should have run out for Davis-
Bacon, and Members of Congress should repeal this harmful
law.

Sincerely,

Dear Representative 

After years of empty rhetoric, I am glad to see true reform 
brewing in Congress.  I look forward to the day when 
Congress reforms itself via the Citizen Congress Act.

If passed, an initiative such as the Citizen Congress Act 
will help restore my faith in elected officials.  For too 
long, we have been made promises while important measures 
such as term limits and a Balanced Budget Amendment have 
not materialized.

By eliminating perks and wasteful practices from within, 
Congress can begin to reverse the hollow promises of the 
past several years. Abolishment of the federal pension 
system, elimination of franked mass mailings, non-automatic
pay increases, and reduced military aircraft travel are 
significant reforms which also reduce government spending. 
At a time when the country's budget is in poor fiscal 
condition, there is little reason not to tighten the belt 
of Congress.

I was disappointed to see term limits measures fail, yet 
I believe that the Citizen Congress Act is a step in the 
right direction in regards to congressional reform.  I 
understand that Members of Congress work hard and are 
very busy, but I also believe Congress needs to truly 
reidentify with the voters of this country.  I ask that 
you pledge support for this measure, and I look forward
to your reply.

Sincerely,

A Common Sense Test on Contemporary Politics</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER>by Bruce Chapman</CENTER>
</H4>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="/rob_c/Rob%27s%20files/DISCOVERY/starbar.gif" WIDTH=
"468" HEIGHT="25" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P>Here is a test of Common Sense Opinions on Current Politics. Write true
or false next to each item and, at the end, see how you scored.<BR>
<BR>
1. A presidential candidate, such as Ross Perot, who continually fails to
reach beyond 4 to 8 percent in the opinion polls and never would have been
in the race in the first place if he hadn&iacute;t been rich, is not owed
a position in the televised presidential debates. And he shouldn&iacute;t
get one.<BR>
<BR>
2. If Perot is invited to the debates, anyway, so should Harry Browne of
the Libertarian Party and Ralph Nader of the Green Party. At least the show
would be more entertaining.<BR>
<BR>
3. Broad tax relief that allows people to spend more of their money according
to their own priorities is better than &igrave;targeted&icirc; tax breaks
that assume the government knows best how people should spend their money.
Thus, Dole is right in his approach and Clinton is wrong.<BR>
<BR>
4. Regardless, Dole, if elected, is more likely to follow through on his
tax cuts than Clinton is with his. <BR>
<BR>
5. In domestic affairs, the number one issue facing America is entitlement
spending. Both parties know that the rate of growth in Medicare must be
reduced if the integrity of the system is to be preserved, and that little
or no damage will be done to seniors if modest steps are taken now. The
actual legislation that the Republicans tried to pass was responsible and
fair, despite the demagogic spin put on it by the current crop of Democratic
and AFL-CIO ads.<BR>
<BR>
6. Social Security takes roughly 12 and a half percent of people&iacute;s
payroll income. For the next few years, while the government takes in more
from Social Security taxes than it pays out, it is possible to a) assure
present recipients of exactly the Social Security payments they expect and
b) allow young people to turn their future payments into a mutual fund savings
instrument tied to the private economy and thereby save significantly more
for their future. The proposal has wide support in think tanks and among
economists.That this idea is not even being discussed so far by either Mr.Clinton
or Mr. Dole is testimony to the threat of demagogy on this subject. <BR>
<BR>
7. Mr. Clinton has a new spending proposal each campaign day. For example,
he wants to fund more Americorps community volunteers, even though taxpayers
pay $27,000 per &igrave;volunteer,&icirc; about twice what comparable volunteers
cost private charities. If he is re-elected, Mr. Clinton&iacute;s statement
that &igrave;The era of big government is over&icirc; will become one of
the most ironic political pronouncements of all time, along with Herbert
Hoover&iacute;s &igrave;Prosperity is just around the corner.&icirc; <BR>
<BR>
8. Under the new federal so-called &igrave;reform&icirc; laws a lobbyist
may not pay for a dinner for a senator anywhere within 35 miles of the Capitol.
But he can take the senator on an &igrave;inspection trip&icirc; to Paris
and have his corporation or oganization pay for the whole thing. The rule
should be the opposite. No politician is going to be bought for the price
of a dinner, while a glamorous, all-expenses paid trip may raise &szlig;real
questions. Congress--and the professional &igrave;reformers&icirc; that
live off controversy--should get real.<BR>
<BR>
9. Under the same new &igrave;reform&icirc; laws, members of Congress who
may not receive a free meal from a lobbyist, constituents or almost anyone
else, are quite free, however, to provide free meals for the lobbyist, constituents,
or whomever. Later, the Congressmen also are free to ask the lobbyists for
campaign contributions, and from those campaign contriibutions--pooled in
their campaign funds-- pay off all their meal chits. This is considered
part of the expense of doing business, and since it can&iacute;t be charged
to the taxpayers, it can be charged to campaign funds. This shows again
a) that petty reform laws can almost always be circumvented, and b) that
there&iacute;s no such thing as a free lunch.<BR>
<BR>
10. It is wrong for the media to refer to Sherry Rowlands, the prostitute
hired by Presidential &igrave;family values&icirc; adviser Dick Morris,
as a &igrave;call girl.&icirc; The proper term should be &igrave;call person.&icirc;<BR>
<BR>
Results: The correct answer for each question is &igrave;True,&icirc; except
for the last, number 10, which is definitely false (Tsk, tsk. Common sense
must hold to standard English, even in vernacular speech--just as in standard
morality.) Give yourself 10 points for each correct answer. If you scored
under 50, you seriously need to re-examine your prejudices, although the
same is true for many of your fellow citizens and most of the media. A score
of 60 to 90 shows that you have a common sense understanding of the American
political scene. Congratulations! A perfect score puts you in perfect harmony
with the author and cannot be admired too highly. <BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<PRE>An information technology visionary who writes compellingly about the 
relationship between technology and economics, George Gilder is the 
author of Microcosm: The Quantum Revolution in Economics and Technology 
(1989), Wealth and Poverty (1981), and numerous other works. His 1990 
book Life after Television: The Coming Transformation of Media and 
American Life is now being issued by W.W. Norton Co. in a revised 
paperback edition with five new chapters.

	Gilder has been a fellow of the John F. Kennedy School of 
Government at Harvard and is currently a senior fellow of the Discovery 
Institute in Seattle. He lectures widely across the Country and around 
the world and will be a featured speaker at the Educom'94 conference 
this fall in San Antonio. Educom Review caught up with him just as he 
was about to leave for Europe to present a speech at Cambridge 
University.

Educom Review: You've used &quot;A Convergence of Corpses&quot; as the title for 
the prologue to Life after Television, and you've said that mergers such 
as the one recently attempted by Bell Atlantic and TCI &quot;mostly miss the 
point of the digital age.&quot; Who are all these corpses, and how are all 
these mergers missing the point?

<B>GILDER</B>: The real driving force of all this information technology is the 
triumph of the computer. Just as the personal computer essentially 
displaced the mainframe over the past ten years, over the next ten years 
the personal computer will displace the television set, the telephone, 
and an array of other appliances. So companies that attempt to exploit 
the opportunities of convergence by converging with TV sets, for 
example, tend to fail, as 3DO seems already to have failed, precisely 
because of that mistake. Meanwhile, Creative Labs was based on a less 
exciting technology--a soundboard for the PC--but has become an enormous 
company riding the tremendous ascendancy of 
personal computing.

<B>ER</B>: So your advice to 3DO would have been . . . ?

<B>GILDER</B>: Well, my advice at the time was that they had better get 
connected to computers and regard computers as the interactive 
appliance. If they focused on the TV set, they would lose. And that's 
what seems to have been happening.
Other errors are being made by companies that target the set-top box and 
devote an enormous amount of design effort to squeezing computing power 
into the price point and form factor of a consumer electronics set-top 
box. 

<B>ER</B>: Why did 3DO ignore your advice?

<B>GILDER</B>: Well, I guess they were just infatuated with television. They'd 
come from founding MTV, and they imagined TV as an instrument with a 
future that somehow commands larger markets than the personal computer. 

But personal computers in homes are increasing ten times faster than 
television sets, and PC owners spend fifteen hundred bucks for the 
device itself and then another fifteen hundred bucks on software and 
peripherals, and within that price point you can accomplish anything 
that a set-top box or game machine can accomplish. And if you have 
broadband connections, for example, over cable lines through a cable 
modem, the PC can do anything the TV can do and do it just as well. 

That's the key limitation today: bandwidth. As Andy Grove says, infinite 
processing power will get you only so far with limited bandwidth. The 
key to the next generation of computer development is coupling the 
personal computer with broadband networks. 

Today, the personal computer is crippled by its need to devote most of 
its MIPs [million instructions per second], or a large portion of them, 
to compressing and decompressing any images that it uses. Thus 
teleconferencing, for example, and video telephones are so drastically 
unsatisfactory because all the computer MIPs are devoted to compressing 
and decompressing rather than to real computer functions. 

Once the PC is connected to broadband networks, it will really ascend to 
its dominant level in homes as well as offices. And that will be the 
crucial opportunity for educational materials as well.

<B>ER</B>: You say in Life after Television that &quot;TV ignores the reality that 
people are not inherently couch potatoes; given a chance they talk back 
and interact.&quot; Then how do you explain some of the disappointments of 
interactivity, such as GTE's Cerritos project, or the US West/TCI 
project in Denver, neither of which seemed to gain much loyalty from its 
subscribers?

<B>GILDER</B>: The explanation is that they all use the TV, and the TV is 
inherently a couch potato device, which is particularly lame at 
presenting text. Yet text is a crucial part of multimedia communications 
and interactivity. Those projects made the same error that 3DO made: 
they converged with a corpse. Unless you're a necrophiliac, that's not 
particularly gratifying.

<B>ER</B>: Alan Kay used the phrase &quot;mouse potatoes&quot; to express the concern 
that the new media would be mass communications oriented and that 
literacy would fall apart.

<B>GILDER</B>: Well, any instrument that creates &quot;mouse potatoes&quot; is going to 
fail, because it's going to make people poorer. Markets expand in the 
long run only if they are absolutely central industries in the economy--
if they're creating capital rather than depleting it. TV in general 
dissipates and deflates human capital, and game machines are 
distractions that fail to edify their users. 

The people who use PCs generate wealth with them rather than merely 
distract themselves, so they're willing to invest a lot more effort into 
their PCs. They're willing to master the intricacies of use, and they're 
also willing to contribute to the development of further applications. 
In contrast, all these consumer electronics devices are mostly self-
limiting, because they don't contribute to wealth creation, but instead 
actually distract people from their career and their higher pursuits.

<B>ER</B>: By emphasizing the extent to which people are different, don't you 
run the risk of ignoring how much they are actually the same, that is, 
of ignoring what we might uncharitably call the herd instinct that 
dictates a lot of fashion, a lot of politics, and a lot of life?

<B>GILDER</B>: Well, I think that people are the same in relatively lower-level 
ways, so if you have a medium that appeals chiefly to the way people are 
the same, they're going to gravitate increasingly to prurient interests, 
morbid fears and anxieties, and shocks and sensations. If you do that, 
the whole culture will become depraved--and I think that's what happened 
with the TV--whereas I think that if you appeal to people's special 
curiosities and hobbies and career interests and other ambitions--if you 
appeal to people's first choices rather than their lowest-common-
denominator choices--then the culture gravitates toward excellence 
rather than toward mediocrity, toward distinction rather than prurient 
interest and titillation.

<B>ER</B>: So what becomes of the herd instinct? Does it go away?
GILDER: There will always be certain things that people still want to do 
in large numbers, but in general it's people as individuals or as 
members of homes and families that can cement to more edifying 
disciplines. A mob can just say yes or no, whereas an individual can 
articulate, can express subtle and complex ideas, can respond to art, 
can aspire toward God. 

Rather than encouraging the mass tendencies of the population, we should 
be trying to counteract them and to educate the population. Education is 
a fulfillment of individual distinction and excellence; it shouldn't be 
a pandering to mass taste and appetites. And to the extent that schools 
do try to cater to their students rather than to teach them, the schools 
will fail and will contribute to the general deterioration of learning.

<B>ER</B>: If we think of life before television as the age of the amateur 
(with social life focused on the family piano, on amateur theater 
groups, on sandlot baseball games), and life during television as the 
age of the professional (with social life organized around boob tube 
performances by millionaire actors, comedians, athletes, and 
politicians), how should we think about the quality of life after 
television? Will it help us back to the idyllic past of the amateur? Or 
will it be better than our past as well our present?

<B>GILDER</B>: I think it will be better. I think the culture will take a form 
more resembling the book culture than the TV culture. There are 55,000 
books published in the United States every year. There's a religious 
book market as big as the trade book market, and each of those markets 
amount to about $2.5 billion. There are a huge number of successful 
technical books and career books, and there's a wide diversity of 
literature. I think the book market is a much better reflection of 
American culture than the TV market, which I think is a perversion of 
American culture. 

In general, the interactive media culture will resemble book culture and 
literary culture more than it will the current mass culture. You know, 
the people who produce mass culture are the ultimate elitists. I've 
often debated with them, and they'll say to me, &quot;You don't understand, 
George, the reason that the boob tube is an idiot box is that people 
really are boobs. We've done market research. We know they're boobs.&quot;

 Well, I think they just don't understand the business. Of course, 
confronted with the boob tube, we're all boobs; when I get into a hotel 
room at night and start clicking through channels, I get distracted by 
the shocks and sensations just as anyone else would. The critical fact 
is that a mass medium is no good whatsoever at conveying educated ideas; 
if it happens to convey a sophisticated idea, that's just an accident. 

I think the French were perfectly right in trying to exclude U.S. 
television programs, because for the most part such programs are the 
ultimate realization of mass taste, and they are depraved and 
destructive. They are deeply destructive to American society, 
particularly to any effort to educate anyone in it. And yet the schools 
increasingly try to simulate the TV culture, which is their worst 
betrayal!

<B>ER</B>: Simulate TV culture in what way?

<B>GILDER</B>: By having students read dumb books that seem to be simulations 
of TV sensibility. By avoiding anything difficult. By trying to pander 
to the kids, to entertain them rather than teach them.

<B>ER</B>: Compare two serious approaches to television: PBS and C-SPAN. Some 
people have said that C-SPAN is what public television ought to be. What 
do you think?

<B>GILDER</B>: C-SPAN now exists without the aid of public TV, and PBS works at 
all only because of the garbage that's on all the other channels. Just 
by being explicitly elitist, PBS can shine luminously in the darkness. 
But beyond that, I just don't really believe any of these channels or 
networks have a future. And, particularly, I don't think TV news has any 
future at all. So I believe that although within the existing regime of 
thirty channels or whatever, C-SPAN and PBS are better than the others, 
it's all still a vast wasteland. A channel like C-SPAN will still have a 
place in a world where you have one channel and it's yours, but 
enterprises like PBS and CNN are resources only for a world in which 
there are few channels and no control over them.

<B>ER</B>: Why is there no future for TV news?

<B>GILDER</B>: Because TV news is all governed by the two-minute rule, which 
says that you can't devote more than two minutes to a story unless it's 
a war or something. But the reason for that is not that people have any 
particular desire for two-minute stories; to the contrary, people want 
much more than two minutes on any story that actually interests them.
TV's two-minute rule exists because people will zap any story longer 
than two minutes that doesn't interest them. And so network news is 
guided entirely by that negative constraint, and within the two-minute 
limit, it necessarily has to go for sensational images and crashes and 
fires and murders and whatever. 

News is getting worse and worse that way, and the only reason TV news 
now succeeds is its timeliness and its ability to present video, but 
newspapers will shortly be able to present video and pictures and 
everything else in just as timely a way as television does; moreover, 
the newspaper of the future will be able to give you access to archives 
and to advertisements that actually step you through to the transaction 
itself, a process that requires text.

<B>ER</B>: You've pointed out in Life after Television that some 70 percent of 
the costs of a film go for distribution and advertising, saying, &quot;In 
every industry--from retailing to insurance--the key impact of the 
computer-networking revolution is to collapse the costs of distribution 
and remove the middlemen.&quot; What's the future of the middlemen in 
educational systems? Do you agree with Lew Perelman's thesis in School's 
Out that hyperlearning will replace, rather than merely reform, 
conventional education?

<B>GILDER</B>: Yeah, I agree mostly with Lew. I don't think that things change 
so abruptly as he implies they will, but it's clear that because schools 
are centralized and dominated by these educationist elites, they're 
ineffective in teaching children. And so I think in the same way as the 
computer has tended to break down all existing hierarchies, monopolies, 
pyramids, and power grids of established industrial society, it will 
break down centralized educational institutions as well. There is no 
correlation--period--between spending per student and performance per 
student, adjusted for education and income of parents. But there is a 
very statistically significant negative correlation between the amount 
of bureaucracy per student and the performance of the student. 

So it's clear that the middlemen in education are not merely dead wood, 
they are also a  destructive force, and they actually prevent education. 
It's teachers that are needed, and teachers don't need much supervision. 

The computer essentially replaces vertically organized institutions with 
horizontally organized institutions. It distributes intelligence and 
power rather than concentrates them; it endows teachers with authority 
and responsibility rather than reducing teachers to being instruments of 
some educational bureaucracy. And the reason teachers don't care about 
anything but money as far as their organizations are concerned is that 
the bureaucrats have destroyed the experience of teaching and the 
gratification of teaching. This is why the schools are such perverse 
institutions. As Lew Perelman says, academia is a socialist bureaucracy 
as big as the Soviet government at its height, and it is going to fail 
just about as cataclysmically.

<B>ER</B>: Do your observations apply from top to bottom? Do they also apply to 
higher education?

<B>GILDER</B>: Well, I think there's greater diversity in higher education--
quite a lot of diversity--and that the schools people think are good are 
mostly bad, and some of the schools people think are bad are in fact 
quite good. For example, I think about 70 percent of the courses at 
Harvard are useless. You know less when you finish than when you 
started. All those endless sociology courses and social science courses 
and social psychology and political science courses, and the endless 
efforts to retrieve some inkling of truth from Marxism!  
You know, it's as though they were still teaching some pre-Copernican 
astronomy--they're really obscurantists in those institutions. It 
reflects the collapse of the elite culture in the United States, but I 
think there are a lot of other cultures out there, and a lot of schools 
that people don't pay attention to are in fact a lot better. Schools 
like Hillsdale, schools like Thomas Aquinas.

There are also schools like CalTech and Harvey Mudd--schools that are 
excellent in science and technology. These are the best schools in the 
country, because the one thing this culture does well is science and 
technology. One of the real jokes is when you find MIT increasingly 
trying to teach students the humanities. I think the humanities as 
taught in existing universities are mostly perverse: Nihilist, 
relativist, feminist, and Marxist. Marxism is just a completely 
worthless mode of study, and yet it's pursued intently at a great many 
elite universities as though there's something still in it.

<B>ER</B>: What would you recommend to a 17-year-old?

<B>GILDER</B>: Well, I think there are two possibilities. One is, if such 17-
year-old boys or girls really have their act together, have strong 
convictions, and know what they want to study, then it would be 
interesting to attend one of the elite universities and be kind of a 
counterforce there and create an adversarial culture. Publications like 
the Dartmouth Review, the Salient at Harvard, and the Prospect at 
Princeton are part of a whole series of conservative publications across 
the country that are kinds of centers of resistance and rebellion on 
these corrupt campuses, and that's probably a pretty good education, to 
pursue that course. In general, however, I'd recommend getting a 
technical or scientific education, because I don't think the schools are 
teaching anything else.

<B>ER</B>: Granting that technological advances will have a great impact on the 
general culture, don't you fear that money will have an even greater 
impact? Are cities with thirty trashy radio stations better served than 
towns with only two, and are they not the victims of investors who are 
chasing maximum ad revenues? Have the 55,000 trade books published last 
year in the United States produced a better general culture? Or has the 
culture been affected mainly by the small number of books--and movies 
and television shows--that were hyped into best-seller-dom?

<B>GILDER</B>: I think that America is still the world's leading economy and it 
produces a tremendous amount of art and literature that elude the elite 
media and elite institutions and elite critical vessels. If American 
culture were really summed up by TV culture, there would be no leading 
software company, no world-leading 
scientific/educational enterprise, no globally ascendant computing 
industry. Bioengineering wouldn't be centered in the United States, and 
so forth.

So I really don't think this elite mass culture--and I believe it is 
elitist, contrived by elites to pander to mass prurience and anxiety--
can generate anything worthwhile, and I don't think it does. The actual 
success of the United States does not stem from what the media generally 
treat--in other words, phenomena like the personal computer that are 
incomparably more important than phenomena like Madonna.

<B>ER</B>:  What is the hardest part of your ideas for people to comprehend? 
I'm sure that many of the people in charge of the converging corpses of 
Hollywood, TV, cable, and publishing have read your books or heard you 
speak. Why do you think they can't get the message?

<B>GILDER</B>: Well, I think a lot of them do get the message, and the ones who 
do are actually doing well. The ones who are pursuing the PC incurred 
nothing but upside surprises last year. At the beginning of the year it 
was predicted by Bill Gates and Andy Grove--the world's leading experts 
on the subject--that between 34 and 37 million personal computers would 
be sold in 1993; the actual number turned out to be almost 50 million 
computers--about 30 or 40 percent more than expected. 

And all the people who produce software and peripherals for personal 
computers and personal computer networks prospered. The computer 
industry grew 20 percent or so last year, while consumer electronics was 
stagnant. A lot of people developed CD-ROMs, which were a $5-billion 
business last year, up from virtually nothing a few years ago. 

The cable industry, which I consulted with a lot and which I think I 
influenced a lot, recently launched a wide array of products to connect 
computers over the cable network, and those products are going to be 
very important and valuable. I predict that during the next five years 
or so the computer industry will yield more products for cable companies 
than the TV industry does.

<B>ER</B>: What advice would you give to the president of a college or 
university?

<B>GILDER</B>: I think a kind of organizing principle, such as St. John's Great 
Books Program or St. Thomas Aquinas's orientation toward the Catholic 
worldview, can animate an educational experience, whereas trying to be a 
smorgasbord of secular social theory is going to result in both a bad 
experience for students and failure as an educational institution. 
You've got to be willing to teach some specific thing. You can't adopt 
some relativist posture, because that will mean that fanatics will 
dominate the institution, and most of these institutions are dominated 
by propagandists rather than by teachers.

<B>ER</B>: And what would you advise college and university presidents to do 
with regard to information technology?

<B>GILDER</B>: They should digitize their libraries and make them available 
from student rooms over computer networks. They should in general not 
restrict the resources of the college to the classrooms in it, but reach 
out from their own classrooms to students around the world who want to 
take courses with the excellent teachers available, while at the same 
time allowing the students on campus to reach out around the world. In 
other words, make your educational institution one that summons the best 
from universities everywhere, rather than focusing on the faculty and 
students that happen to be assembled at your particular location.</PRE>

Please, Mr. President and Congress, A Shorter Campaign Next Time</CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Never have so many politicians </B>worked so hard and spent
so much to achieve so little change. With the White House still in Democratic
hands, Congress still Republican and exactly the same partisan division
of governors, the nation's politics are roughly where they were a year and
a half ago when history's longest presidential campaign began. What was
achieved? Altogether, marathon fundraising and organizing and advertising
achieved a great record <B><I>low</I></B> turnout, 49 percent. <BR>
<BR>
The result of the voters' collective mixed message was, give us more of
the same. What each voter was saying was more complex, of course. But surely
there is one point on which we each might agree: This thing went on far
too long. <BR>
<BR>
Fourteen months ago I wrote in this space that bunching the presidential
primaries together and &quot;front loading&quot; them in the winter and
early spring of 1996 would prolong the campaign agony for citizens as well
as candidates. No wonder the mood by election day was one of embarrassment
approaching nausea in many voters, and stunned apathy in the rest. By the
end my neighbors were muttering that they wished they had gone away on vacation.
Friends said they were tempted to lock themselves in their houses, disconnect
the television and take up meditation--or worse. Some may have been driven
mad; they haven't been seen in weeks, and certainly didn't show up at the
polls. <BR>
<BR>
It customarily is said that the voters don't start paying attention to campaigns
until Labor Day. This year they worked hard to avert their eyes through
the whole show. Thus the paradox: The longer the campaign, the less the
public pays attention. To be charitable, it wasn't so much a lack of interest
as the gagging lack of oxygen one encounters in the air of unreality around
a campaign. You can take the atmospheric depression for a couple months,
but then you start to pass out. <BR>
<BR>
Nor is the national mental health the only loss. A President was distracted
from his duties for over one fourth of his first term. Not that he minded,
of course. But those days of fundraising and leading rallies were days when
he did not attend to normal business. The same goes for the voters. The
months spent learning--falsely--that Medicare was threatened were months
when long term solutions to the looming entitlement crisis were not addressed
at all. Indeed, it could be said that by avoiding the real issues facing
the country, or exploiting them for demagogic ends, the national campaign
served to decrease the sum of popular knowledge. <BR>
<BR>
It doesn't have to be this way. In September, while our campaign ground
on, the Japanese called a national election, and six weeks later, held it.
All the action was concentrated, and therefore bearable. <BR>
<BR>
We have come to the stage of our history where elections no longer provide
political catharsis. Nor do they produce anger or division, necessarily.
They produce exhaustion. <BR>
<BR>
Of course there are no panaceas in public life, but there are some things
that could help prevent a repeat of the Long Campaign of 1996. First, the
President and Congress could agree to prohibit any dispersal of federal
campaign matching funds to abet funds raised by presidential candidates,
unless they were raised after December, 1999. That would tend to dry up
about four to six months of early campaigning, or at least to slow it. <BR>
<BR>
The second contribution to sanity would be to change the election date from
November to October and move the inauguration forward from late January
to early December. In the Information Age we don&iacute;t need several months
to communicate with voters. &quot;The first Tuesday after the first Monday
in November&quot; is a date set in law in 1872; it&iacute;s not the Constitution,
and there is nothing sacred about it. The inauguration date also can be
changed. The third week in January is typically the worst week of winter
in Washington, D.C., while early December is usually cold, but endurable,
and sometimes quite pleasant. <BR>
<BR>
Knocking out a month of campaigning at the end would concentrate people&iacute;s
interest while weakening the present demand for money for television ads.
There&iacute;s only so much air time for sale, and after a campaign starts
buying it during the midnight wrestling matches, you know they are over-spending.
If the First Amendment cannot limit spending, let the calendar do it. <BR>
<BR>
Another reform would be to persuade the political parties to pass a rule
refusing to seat delegates to the national nominating conventions who were
selected in primaries held before mid-March. This apparently is the only
way to force states to repeal the front-loaded schedule and thereby to shorten
the campaign. Unfortunately, this reform needed approval at this year&iacute;s
conventions in order to apply in 2000. <BR>
<BR>
Besides, all of this was known by the parties over a year ago and ignored.
Now that the campaign is over, the lesson also will be ignored by the public
until it is taught once more in 2000. Then it will be too late, again, to
change before 2004. There does not seem to be enough sustained public annoyance
to force Washington, D.C. to fix the problem. <BR>
<BR>
Fellow voters, am I wrong about that?</BLOCKQUOTE>

What should every schoolchild know about the history of this land of liberty we call America?  The National History Standards Project, sponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the U.S. Education Department, attempted to provide an answer to this
question; however, their report, released in late 1994, contains serious omissions and amusing political correctness.  In response, the Family Research Council prepared <I> Let Freedom Ring!, </I>an outline of U.S. history that avoids political fashion and emphasizes real knowledge of America's past.

America's history young adults today do not believe they will exceed the

<BLOCKQUOTE>Some people think we can shore up the failing Social Security
system by pouring billions more tax dollars into a system basically unchanged

<BLOCKQUOTE>Economic Security 2000 is committed to reviving the Roosevelet

<BR>
We have time to transform Social Security, but we must act quickly -- before

<p>
<H2>DRUGS IN AMERICA</h2>
</center>
<p>
<H3>OVERVIEW</H3>
<dd>	From 1980 to 1992, under Presidents Reagan and Bush, the federal government mounted a strong offensive against drugs, with real results.  The combined effect of vigorous foreign interdiction, tough law enforcement and a morally firm attitude of intolerance toward drug use paid off in significant reductions in both the consumption and availability of drugs. <p>
<dd>	Since 1993, America has in large part abandoned the drug war.  Americans have witnessed a failure of public policy brought about by a moral torpor; policy follows attitude.  But, as recent polling suggests, the public's attitude is not one of indifference to the drug issue.  Americans still want a tough and decisive drug control policy with the federal government rightfully leading the fight.
<p>
<H3>BACKGROUND</H3>
<ul>
<li>Drug use is a major contributing factor to violent crime, child abuse, homelessness, and poverty.  Drugs -- particularly crack cocaine -- have made these and other social pathologies more acute and often unmanageable.
<li>Between 1970 (the peak) and 1992, overall drug use decreased by over 50 percent.   Between 1985 (the peak for cocaine) and 1992, overall cocaine use declined by almost 80 percent.  And between 1984 and 1992, annual illicit drug use trends among 12th graders declined by 41 percent.
<li>The latest reports indicate a resurgence of drug use beginning in 1993.  Annual use among 12th graders is up for 1994 by 33 percent.  Marijuana use among 12-17-year-olds nearly doubled from 1992 to 1994.  And high school use of cocaine and hallucinogens has risen precipitously from a low in 1988.
<li>Drug-related hospital emergency room cases have escalated to their highest numbers since 1978.   In 1994 a record high half-million Americans were treated for drug-related problems, with serious increases in those induced by cocaine. 
<li>In a  survey released in December, 1995 by the Gallup Organization, Americans ranked drugs as the second most important problem (behind crime) facing the nation.
<li>The public strongly supports anti-drug education, strict law enforcement and interdiction; and offers little support for increased treatment programs. 
<li>Legalization of drugs is overwhelmingly rejected by Americans.
</ul>
<p>
<H3>CURRENT POLICY</H3>
<ul>
<li>Shortly after taking office, President Clinton weakened the power and slashed the staff of the Office of National Drug Control Policy.  He proposed cuts in other agencies that have been at the forefront in the war on drugs -- the Drug Enforcement Agency, the FBI and the Immigration and Naturalization Service -- cuts that were largely rejected by the  U.S. Congress.
<li>The Clinton policy abrogated interdiction, tough law enforcement and mandatory minimum sentences. 
<li>The strong moral message of "Just say no"  gave way to "I didn't inhale;" and to a surgeon general who advocated drug legalization. 
<li>The Clinton administration has concentrated its efforts on an unfocused treatment policy that is manifestly wasteful and ineffective.  
</ul>
<p>
<H3> RENEWING THE WAR ON DRUGS</H3>
<ul>
<li>The government should put the U.S. military in charge of stopping the flow of illegal drugs from outside our borders and give the military control over the entire interdiction process.
<li>America must establish trade and diplomatic sanctions and eliminate aid to cocaine source countries that fail to reduce their production.
<li>The federal government must identify and dismantle all major drug trafficking organizations known to be operating in the United States.
<li>Law enforcement, drug treatment and prevention education are state and local responsibilities for which current federal aid should be block granted without mandates.
<li>The President should send a clear and frequently-heard anti-drug message from his bully pulpit, making moral common sense the touchstone of social policy.
</ul>
<p>
<H3>JUST SAY NO TO DRUG LEGALIZATION</H3>
<ul>
<li>Drugs like heroin and cocaine are not dangerous and threatening to American society because they are illegal.  They are illegal because they are dangerous and threatening to American society.
<li>Any relaxation in standards of illegality would make drugs more accessible, cheaper and morally permissible.
</ul>
<p>
<H3>CONCLUSION</H3>
	
It is the first obligation of government to protect the lives and property of its citizens.  Nothing poses a greater threat to both than the scourge of drugs and the violence associated with it.   It is time for the federal government to renew its war on drugs through moral seriousness, and tough-minded and intelligent policies.

For Immediate Release

<CENTER>Small Business Says Thank You to 104th<BR>
</CENTER>
</b>
<hr>
<P>
Washington, D.C. -- The Small Business Survival Committee (SBSC)
today joined a coalition of taxpayer, consumer and senior organizations
to express their thanks to the 104th Congress.  SBSC is specifically
gratified for initiatives undertaken and passed to help entrepreneurs
and small businesses.<BR>
<P>
&quot;Looking back at the last two years, the 104th Congress passed
historical measures to help small business and promote entrepreneurship,&quot;
said SBSC President Karen Kerrigan.<BR>
<P>
The &quot;Salute to the 104th Congress&quot; event was held on
Capitol Hill today to thank Members both individually and collectively
for their bold steps to help protect entrepreneurs and encourage
small business start-ups.  SBSC joined Americans for Tax Reform,
Citizens Against Government Waste, Seniors Coalition, Chamber
of Commerce and other groups in sponsoring the event.  House Speaker
Newt Gingrich and other members of the House leadership were on
hand to address those attending the recognition ceremonies.<BR>
<P>
SBSC praised Republican-led reforms which were signed by the President.
 They also thanked Congress for passing a comprehensive small
business agenda yet vetoed by Clinton.  Among the reforms passed
by the House and either vetoed or opposed by the President:  capital
gains tax reduction, estate tax reform, comprehensive regulatory
relief, legal reform, the TEAM Act and property rights protection.
<BR>
<P>
&quot;While we are pleased that President Clinton signed several
of the initiatives targeted to help small businesses, unfortunately
he vetoed or stood in the way of other reform priorities recommended
by his own White House Conference on Small Business,&quot; added
Kerrigan.<BR>
<P>
SBSC applauded the Congress for its passage of health insurance
reforms to help small business including the phasing-in of deductibility
to 80 percent, and passing Medical Savings Accounts.  In addition,
regulators are now more accountable to small businesses because
Congress put teeth into Regulatory Flexibility.  Regulators must
also publish their rules and regulations in &quot;Plain English&quot;
and Congress can now conduct a final review of regulations and
vote to reject them.<BR>
<P>
&quot;Most importantly, the 104th Congress began to chip away
at the old status quo through its cuts in wasteful government
spending to balance the budget.  The two words that were dropped
from President Clinton's vocabulary after the '92 elections were
'Balanced Budget' until the 104th Congress came to town,&quot;
remarked Kerrigan.<BR>
<P>
In conclusion, SBSC has given the 104th Congress high marks for
its bold agenda.  &quot;No big tax increases like 1993, no attempts
for a government take-over of the health care system and making
small businesses pay for it like 1994 -- the 104th Congress initiated
mostly positive steps to encourage job creation and small business
growth and start-ups,&quot; Kerrigan concluded.<BR>
<P>

<H2>GUATEMALA Y SU BUROCRACIA</H2>
<p>
Manuel F. Ayau*
<p>
CIUDAD DE GUATEMALA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Cada da estamos ms a la cola en las listas de
pases segn su riqueza y (ser coincidencia?) tambin entre las naciones
que gozan de menos libertad.  Aqu el ciudadano no es libre de hacer nada
por derecho, pues todo requiere una ley que permite que algn brillante
funcionario del gobierno le d licencia o autorizacin.  El dictador no
tiene nombre y apellido; es el funcionario que sabe mejor que Ud. cmo
manejar su negocio.
<p>
Lo primero que debemos reconocer es que la pobreza es culpa
nuestra y slo la podemos curar desde adentro. Las ddivas del exterior que
tanto nos gustan solamente son unas gotas que ms bien sirven de soporfero
humillante y que contribuyen a agrandar la brecha entre los pases ricos y
nosotros porque nos da una falsa esperanza que pospone tomar las medidas
correctas. Y esa ayuda casi siempre viene acompaada de consejos
equivocados, pues los dispensadores de ddivas, debido a la misma filosofa
que los califica para su trabajo, tienen una visin poco realista del mundo
real.
<p> 
La preocupacin por la brecha entre ricos y pobres es uno de
los factores que no permiten eliminar la miseria porque cuando la riqueza
del pas aumenta, los pobres son menos pobres, pero los ricos son ms ricos.
Tenemos entonces que escoger qu es lo que queremos lograr: eliminar la
pobreza o eliminar las diferencias entre pobres y ricos?
<p>
Volando sobre la capital y observando cmo se ha rodeado de
cinturones de pobreza, me pregunto, cunta gente viene del interior porque
no hay telfonos y por ello no se establecen empresas ni se crean empleos.
Esos cinturones son parte del precio de haber prohibido que cualquiera
pudiera competir en el negocio telefnico en nuestra paternalista Guatemala.  
<p>
Nos tom muchos aos aprender que una tasa de cambio
artificial causaba crisis y, en consecuencia, retrocedimos una dcada.
Despus nos ha costado mucho aprender que haber elevado las tasas de inters
a niveles estratosfricos produce recesin. Cada vez que probamos una
"brillante" poltica incurrimos en el carsimo proceso de aprendizaje.
<p>
La prxima brillante idea es la de privatizar "con creatividad". En vez de simplemente
privatizar, es decir, proceder a vender por subasta pblica internacional las empresas
estatales y dejarlas que operen libremente bajo las leyes generales del pas, ya se
estn inventando ingeniosos modelos, avalados por "brillantes" asesores extranjeros
("empresarios" en recomendar polticas) para que el gobierno dirija la
industria elctrica, d concesiones, otorgue licencias, fije precios, etc.
Todo para que las empresas privadas "no hagan cosas inconvenientes".
Adems, se bautiz a los nuevos ministerios con otros nombres, como
Superintendencia de Comunicaciones o la Comisin Nacional de Electricidad.
Estos pequeos nuevos ministerios, al cabo de los aos, tendrn su propio
edificio, donde se puedan hacer trmites engorrosos. As mismo nacieron el
Inde, Guatel, Minera, Hidrocarburos y tantas otras superintendencias y
comisiones que nos han empobrecido, impidiendo el progreso nacional.  
<p>
La Corte de Constitucionalidad anul la Constitucin y nos
inform que Guatel no es un monopolio telefnico aunque est prohibido
competir con l. Tambin nos dijo que los precios de la energa se pueden
interferir por razones ideolgicas, aunque no cubran costos. Y el nuevo
proyecto de ley elctrica mantiene que los precios de la energa son libres,
siempre que no se usen las calles para distribuirla. Brillante!
Evidentemente seguiremos pobres porque en Guatemala seguimos confundiendo un
rgimen de legalidad con uno de derecho.

<H2>CHILE EN LAS GRANDES LIGAS</H2>
<p>
Carlos A. Ball*
<p>
MIAMI (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Cuando en Amrica Latina hablbamos de empresas
multinacionales nos referamos a compaas como la Standard Oil, United
Fruit, US Steel o Anaconda. Esas han cambiado sus nombres, han perdido
importancia o fueron nacionalizadas durante nuestra mala racha de socialismo
nacionalista. Pero lo interesante es que hoy varias de las ms vigorosas
multinacionales, en plena expansin en pases como Argentina, Per y Brasil,
son empresas de capital chileno que hasta hace menos de una dcada eran
comatosas empresas estatales, con exceso de personal y que adems de dar
psimo servicio producan inmensas prdidas.
<p>
 Una de estas nuevas multinacionales, Enersis S.A., a fines de noviembre
coloc exitosamente, a travs de J. P. Morgan, Merril Lynch y Salomon
Brothers, $800 millones en bonos con vencimiento en los aos 2006, 2016 y
2026. Parte de esos fondos irn a Brasil, donde Enersis -en asociacin con
empresas elctricas de Espaa y Portugal- acaba de ganar la licitacin para
adquirir por $588 millones el 70% de la Compaa Elctrica de Ro de
Janeiro, una empresa estatal que durante los primeros nueve meses de este
ao logr perder $122 millones.
<p>
 Segn el Wall Street Journal, Enersis hoy en da controla empresas con
valor de mercado por unos $13.000 millones, habindose logrado convertir en
una de las favoritas de los inversionistas institucionales especializados en
mercados emergentes.
<p>
 Jos Yuraszeck, el presidente de 45 aos de Enersis S.A., era a principios
de los aos 70 uno de los valientes jvenes estudiantes que manifestaban su
oposicin al rgimen socialista de Salvador Allende. Luego del golpe
militar, el gobierno de Pinochet le asign la misin de desmantelar el
control estatal en la empresa elctrica de Santiago, Chilectra Metropolitana.
<p>
 Chilectra fue privatizada en 1987 y Yuraszeck logr convertirse en su
administrador con el apoyo de fondos de pensin privados y de los empleados
que adquirieron acciones de la empresa. Poco despus repetira la misma
estrategia para comprar la Empresa Nacional de Electricidad (Endesa), la ms
grande  generadora de energa elctrica en Chile. Bajo la visionaria
gerencia de Jos Yuraszeck, la capitalizacin de Enersis, la empresa matriz
duea tanto de Chilectra como Endesa, se ha multiplicado 57 veces desde
1988, hasta alcanzar unos $4.000 millones en la actualidad. 
<p>
 Su primera inversin extranjera la realiz el grupo en 1992, en la
Argentina, al adquirir el control de Edesur S.A., una de las empresas
distribuidoras de electricidad en Buenos Aires, a la vez que dos grandes
empresas generadoras: Central Costanera S.A. y El Chocn. En 1994, el grupo
Enersis hara lo mismo en Lima, al adquirir una importante participacin en
la empresa ms grande de energa elctrica del Per. El xito de Enersis en
el extranjero se basa en reducir drsticamente el robo de electricidad y
cambiar el tradicional letargo burocrtico de las empresas estatales de
energa por una vibrante cultura empresarial.
<p>
 Adems de una inversin inicial de $490 millones para la adquisicin de
Edesur, Enersis invirti otros $340 millones en modernizar las
instalaciones, convirtiendo a 360.000 personas que se aprovechaban de
energa gratuita en clientes de la empresa. Edesur pas de perder $62
millones en 1993 a producir utilidades por $59,5 millones el ao pasado.
<p>
 Enersis piensa repetir la misma historia con la Compaa de Electricidad de
Ro de Janeiro, la cual da servicio a 1,2 millones de clientes. El potencial
de crecimiento en el Brasil es inmenso.
<p>
 De todo esto, la primera leccin es que la produccin y distribucin de
energa elctrica nada tiene que ver con "soberana" ni con industrias
"bsicas y estratgicas reservadas al estado" sino, ms bien, con eficiencia
y productividad. La segunda es que hay amplio financiamiento privado en
respaldo de empresas exitosas y empresarios visionarios. Y la tercera es que
hombres como Yuraszeck los hay tambin en pases como Cuba y Venezuela, slo
que la falta de libertad bajo el socialismo los aplasta.

<H2>INFLACION: LA ESPECIALIDAD DE LA CASA</H2>
<p>
Alvaro Bardn*
<p>
SANTIAGO DE CHILE (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- El nuevo presidente del Banco Central de Chile,
Carlos Massad, entreg recientemente unas cifras sobre la inflacin que
conviene consignar. Sostuvo que desde mediados de los aos 30 hasta la fecha
el nivel de precios se multiplic por un factor de 85 millones, de manera
tal que si alguien hubiera guardado o ahorrado en 1936 mil millones de
pesos, tendra hoy solamente once pesos. Naturalmente, la gente no es
estpida y para evitar en parte el robo inflacionario disminuy su demanda
de pesos y se fue a dlares, al ahorro en bienes durables y materias primas
y desde hace unos 30 aos al ahorro en ttulos reajustables, cuando el
gobierno lo permiti y lo legisl.
<p>
 En el intervalo Chile vivi en huelgas porque los trabajadores, con razn,
pedan reajustes de sus remuneraciones nominales.  Los jubilados, que no
podan hacer protestas efectivas, vean que sus pensiones se desvanecan y
todos los chilenos descubrieron, primero a fines de los 50 y luego a
mediados de los 70, que sus fondos previsionales haban desaparecido y que
las solidarias cajas estatales estaban en quiebra. No slo por la
inflacin-robo sino por mala administracin. En Chile, como se sabe,
cambiamos al sistema privado de pensiones y los fondos estn mejor
invertidos en ttulos reajustables, acciones y una amplia gama de valores en
moneda nacional y extranjera. Dems est decir que la inflacin derrib
varios gobiernos, mediante elecciones, y, por la fuerza a Salvador Allende,
en 1973, cuando el aumento de precios lleg a 1000% y la hiperinflacin nos
aplastaba.

 En 1996 la inflacin fue de 6,5% y en 1997 ser segn Massad, de 5,5%.
Asegura, adems, que hacia fines del siglo Chile tendr una inflacin como
la de los pases industrializados. Sin embargo, no ser fcil porque la
voracidad del gobierno chileno se est pareciendo a la del pasado. Su gasto
ha crecido al 7% real desde 1990 y en 1996 y 1997 se acerca peligrosamente a
los dos dgitos. El fisco mantiene supervit y ahorra porque los ingresos
tributarios han subido por el rpido crecimiento de la economa y por alzas
en impuestos como el IVA, a la renta y otros especficos. Pero el mayor
gasto estatal presiona la demanda interna y con ello la inflacin. 
El Banco Central  se hace cmplice de este mayor gasto manteniendo altas las
tasas de inters y limitando los crditos externos de corto plazo con otro
impuesto que denomina encaje. As se reprime el gasto privado en consumo e
inversin y se le hace espacio al estado para que siga despilfarrando el
dinero de todos en ineficiencia productiva, reajustes a empleados pblicos
que trabajan poco, fomentos intiles y un gasto social enorme que no ha
mejorado los servicios educacionales ni de salud y, se estima, que en ms de
un 60% va a parar a los bolsillos de los que no se clasifican como pobres.
Estos pagan impuestos, como todos, y reciben a cambio algo de lo que queda
despus de las filtraciones a otros sectores y del pago de una frondosa
burocracia.
<p>
 Como es natural, esta poltica terminar por perjudicar la tasa de
crecimiento de la economa chilena y del empleo que ayuda a los pobres
directamente. Esto ya se observa pero se le da poca importancia. Incluso el
premio Nobel Robert Lucas, de visita en el pas, sostuvo que con el vuelo
que agarr la economa chilena con los pasados cambios estructurales poda
seguir creciendo bien un buen rato. Yo, por el contrario, pienso que si no
se corrige la tendencia al alza del gasto pblico, la economa perder
dinamismo y le costar mucho alcanzar las tasas de inflacin de los pases
ms avanzados.

<H2>GANGSTERISMO POLITICO EN VENEZUELA</H2>
<p>
Hctor Betancourt*
<p>
MIAMI (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- En la Venezuela actual, polticos poderosos utilizan a
policas y a jueces para despojar a ciudadanos de sus propiedades. Y no me
refiero a hechos aislados en remotas poblaciones del interior sino a lo que
me est sucediendo a mi, en mi hacienda El Encantado, la mayor extensin de
terreno privado, todava sin desarrollar, en el valle de Caracas.
<p>
 Durante doce aos, el diputado suplente al Congreso Nacional Alejandro
Kaufman ha utilizado el contrato que tiene de administracin del Cementerio
del Este para irse apoderando de los terrenos municipales que rodean al
cementerio, procediendo luego a desplazar linderos, tumbar cercas de los
vecinos y a enterrar muertos en terrenos ajenos. Cuando los propietarios se
vienen a dar cuenta, ya tienen varios cientos de muertos enterrados en sus
tierras, con todas las complicaciones humanas y legales que ello implica.
<p>
 En 1994, el diputado Kaufman se adue fraudulentamente de 100 mil metros
cuadrados de terrenos municipales en complicidad con la Oficina de Registro
del 5 Circuito. Esto fue denunciado al ayuntamiento y al gobierno central,
sin que las autoridades reaccionaran. A mi y a otros propietarios nos
preocupaba porque sabamos que una vez que se adueara de los terrenos
municipales colindantes, Kaufman procedera a invadir y a tratar de
despojarnos de nuestras propiedades, como en efecto ahora est sucediendo.
Kaufman es un personaje que se jacta pblicamente de no tener abogados a su
servicio sino a jueces. Armado de un oficio emitido por la Ingeniera
Municipal que ilegalmente determina que los caminos privados de mi hacienda
son de uso pblico, introduce tractores a mi propiedad para derribar cercas
y portones, respaldado con policas municipales y agentes de la Disip, la
polica poltica, de cuyo director es compadre. Durante la noche y por
varias horas, disparan contra mi casa, donde vivo con mi madre, esposa y
pequeos hijos, para tratar de amedrentarnos y que accedamos a dejarnos
robar. Tambin mantiene intervenidas mis lneas telefnicas y vigila todos
mis movimientos.
<p>
 Parte del problema se debe a la corrupcin rampante en los registros de
propiedad venezolanos. Con unos ttulos de propiedad falsos que incluyen 80
hectreas de mi hacienda, una empresa pirata consigui en 1986 un crdito
por $5 millones en el Banco Industrial, propiedad del estado. Esta hipoteca
fue luego traspasada al Banco Provincial, el banco ms grande del pas. A
pesar que le informamos a la Oficina de Registro y al propio banco que se
trataba de ttulos falsos, en base a la misma hipoteca le aumentaron el
crdito a ms de $20 millones. Cuando la empresa involucrada no pudo pagar
la deuda, el Banco Provincial ejecut la hipoteca y vendi los terrenos el
16 de agosto de este ao a Kaufman por slo $425.000, absorbiendo una
cuantiosa prdida, pero dejando constancia en el documento de venta que no
se responsabiliza del saneamiento de la propiedad. Cmo logra el Banco
Provincial registrar el traspaso de la propiedad cuando los documentos que
tiene son falsos? Pienso que la nica explicacin es que la esposa del
presidente del Banco Provincial es la directora nacional de los registros de
propiedad.
<p>
Cuando denunci estos hechos a la prensa venezolana, la respuesta del
diputado Kaufman fue ingresar a mi hacienda, la noche del 23 de septiembre,
acompaado de 20 hombres, entre ellos policas municipales y agentes de la
Disip uniformados, portando armas de guerra. Kaufman me agredi fsicamente,
rompindome a golpes cuatro costillas, mientras sus secuaces me sujetaban,
todo esto en presencia de mi abogado y del gerente de mi hacienda.
Esa noche ingres a la emergencia de la Clnica Metropolitana de Caracas y
con el informe mdico y las radiografas hice la denuncia ante la Polica
Tcnica Judicial al da siguiente, siendo examinado por funcionarios de la
medicatura forense. Seguidamente, el diputado Kaufman logra que mi denuncia
sea pasada a la jurisdiccin de la juez Mari Carmen La Riva Ron, quien me
llam a declarar y tambin a los mdicos forenses que haban elaborado el
informe. Ellos dijeron -bajo alguna presin- que sus firmas haban sido
falsificadas. La juez, entonces, procedi a emitir el 16 de diciembre una
orden de arresto en mi contra por calumnia agravada y por forjamiento de
documentos.
<p>
 Quien haya ledo el reportaje sobre las crceles de Caracas aparecido en la
primera pgina del Miami Herald el domingo 22 de diciembre, bajo el ttulo
de "Infierno en la Tierra", sabe que nadie en su sano juicio se entrega en
Venezuela y mucho menos durante vacaciones judiciales, cuando los ciudadanos
quedamos totalmente desamparados. Por ello me vi obligado a fugarme en una
avioneta a una isla del Caribe y de all me vine a Florida. Una vez
concluidas las festividades de ao nuevo, tengo todas las intenciones de
seguir en mi lucha por conservar intacta la propiedad que hered de mi padre.
<p>
 Comprendo que el sector poltico venezolano me considera una anomala. En
mi pas, quienes no tenemos padrinos polticos no estamos supuestos a
enfrentarnos a los poderosos sino a negociar con ellos, de manera que lo que
nos quitan sea compensado con alguno de los privilegios que polticos y
funcionarios graciosamente estn en capacidad de asignar. Yo no estoy
dispuesto a convertirme en cmplice del gangsterismo poltico venezolano y
tengo la intencin de dejarle a mis hijos la misma herencia limpia que
recib de mi padre.

<H2>PROPIEDAD PRIVADA Y DESARROLLO SOSTENIBLE</H2>
<p>
Julian Morris*
<p>
SANTA CRUZ DE LA SIERRA, BOLIVIA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Despus de la II Guerra Mundial,
polticos y  economistas se obsesionaron con el tema del desarrollo
econmico. Las naciones fueron clasificadas segn su producto per capita;
aquellas con un producto per capita mayor se designaron "desarrolladas" y
las dems "subdesarrolladas". Instituciones multilaterales como el Banco
Mundial y el FMI que se haban creado para revivir a Europa devastada por la
guerra, pronto se dedicaron a una nueva misin: fomentar el desarrollo
econmico en los pases atrasados. Miles de millones de dlares se gastaron
en proyectos que supuestamente lograran alcanzar la meta del desarrollo.
<p>
 Lamentablemente, los planes simplistas de polticos y burcratas
infrecuentemente alcanzan sus magnnimos propsitos. As sucedi, en parte
porque el dinero lo prestaron a gobiernos que sufren de corrupcin endmica
(se estima que la riqueza personal del presidente Mobutu es igual a la deuda
nacional de Zaire) y tambin porque los proyectos fueron mal concebidos. Por
ejemplo, inmensas obras hidroelctricas benefician a empresas de aluminio
pero poco hacen por eliminar la pobreza entre campesinos que viven en
tierras ridas.
<p>
 En los aos 80 comenz a surgir la preocupacin de que estos proyectos
grandiosos tenan un impacto negativo en el medio ambiente, especialmente
las represas que inundan la selva y obras de riego que salinizan las
tierras. Entonces, el primer ministro noruego, Gro Harlem Brundtland,
invent el trmino "desarrollo sostenible", reconociendo que el desarrollo
industrial no es en s mismo algo positivo, sino que debe lograrse dentro de
un marco legal que proteja el derecho de individuos a no ser perjudicados,
tanto ahora como en el futuro.
<p>
 En la compleja sociedad moderna, la mejor manera de asegurarse que el
desarrollo se lleve a cabo de manera sostenible es descentralizando lo ms
posible el poder de decisin. Esto conlleva a responsabilizar a individuos
por conservar los recursos naturales. Cuando una persona es duea de un
recurso tiene  la motivacin para conservarlo porque sabe que se beneficiar
de l maana, el ao que viene, dentro de una dcada y sus herederos dentro
de un siglo. Cuando los polticos controlan los recursos tienen un menor
incentivo de conservarlo porque su principal inters es ser reelecto.
<p>
 Un reciente estudio de Alex James de Cambridge University encontr que las
inversiones en reservas de animales depende de quien las administra. La
menor inversin se hace en las reservas que son administradas y que
pertenecen al estado; algo ms en las reservas que son del estado pero
administradas independientemente y la inversin es mucho mayor en aquellas
que pertenecen y son administradas por el sector privado.
<p>
 Otra condicin necesaria para el desarrollo sostenible es que los
individuos puedan intercambiar (vender) los derechos de propiedad. Es
deseable que cada recurso se utilice de la manera ms eficiente y ello slo
ocurre cuando cada recurso es utilizado por el individuo que lo valora ms,
para lo cual es necesario que se pueda traspasar libremente la propiedad.
<p>
 Tanto las naciones industrializadas como las naciones en desarrollo
comienzan a darse cuenta que las regulaciones ambientales son a menudo
exageradamente costosas. Adems, muchas regulaciones tienen consecuencias
dainas al medio ambiente. Un ejemplo clsico ocurri en Bolivia, donde se
prohibi la tala de ciertos rboles. Tan pronto la gente se enter de que
iba a salir el decreto, se cortaron muchsimos de esos rboles.
<p>
 Es ms efectivo el cuido del ambiente cuando se les permite a individuos
hacerlo. En Inglaterra, los pescadores han protegido a los ros de la
contaminacin demandando a industrias que los ensuciaban. Lamentablemente,
las regulaciones que estipulan un mximo de emisiones contaminantes de hecho
le dan a las industrias el derecho de contaminar hasta ese lmite. Si vamos
a avanzar hacia el desarrollo sostenible debemos revisar las bases en que se
fundamenta la regulacin ambiental.

<H2>LAS CUENTAS DEL GRAN CAPITAN</H2>
<p>
Agustn Navarro*
<p>
CIUDAD DE MEXICO (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Las "Cuentas del Gran Capitn" son definidas por
el Diccionario de la Lengua Espaola como aquellas cuentas "exorbitantes y
formadas arbitrariamente y sin  justificacin". Algunos autores refieren que
el Gran Capitn Gonzalo de Crdoba present partidas de descargo ante el Rey
de Npoles, que venan a ser as:  "200.736 ducados y 9 reales para frailes,
monjas y pobres que rueguen a Dios por la prosperidad de las armas
espaolas; 100 millones en picos, palas y azadones; 100.000 ducados en
plvora y balas; 10.000 ducados en guantes perfumados para preservar del mal
olor de los cadveres de los enemigos tendidos en el campo de batalla;
170.000 ducados en poner y renovar campanas destruidas con el uso continuo
de repicar por nuevas victorias conseguidas sobre el enemigo; 50.000 ducados
en aguardiente para las tropas en un da de combate; milln y medio de dem
para mantener prisioneros y heridos; un milln en misas de gracias y Te Deum
al Todopoderoso; tres millones de sufragios por los muertos; 700.492 ducados
en espas y cien millones por mi paciencia en escuchar que el Rey peda
cuentas al que le ha regalado un reino".
<p>
 Cualquier semejanza de las cuentas anteriores con la campaa
presidencial mexicana en 1994 y en especial con los gastos electorales en la
ltima eleccin de gobernador en el Estado de Tabasco es pura coincidencia.
Como se ve, este asunto de las cuentas alegres es un recurso muy viejo y
desgastado. 
<p>
La nica innovacin que se advierte en la vetusta tecnologa del maquillaje
de las cifras oficiales es que en Mxico las Cuentas del Gran Capitn se
fabrican con anticipacin a las batallas electorales, como ocurre ahora ante
las cruciales elecciones de 1997, en que estarn en juego la renovacin
total de la Cmara de Diputados, parcial de la Cmara de Senadores, seis
gobernaciones estatales y la sede del Gran Capitn, la gran Ciudad de Mxico.
<p>
 Veamos un caso ejemplar de la tecnologa local en el manejo
de cifras: la milagrosa recuperacin de las reservas internacionales del
pas, proeza casi comparable con nuestra eficacia para perderlas en un
santiamn, en 1994. 
<p>
 Las Cuentas del Gran Capitn Don Miguel Mancera, presidente
del Banco de Mxico, son ms o menos las siguientes: Reservas
Internacionales al cierre: $17.509 millones, $1.768 millones ms que en
1995. Magnfico! Sin embargo, los $5.829 millones de activos netos no toman
en cuenta los pasivos con el Fondo Monetario Internacional por ms de
$13.260 millones. As, las presuntas reservas desaparecen y la falsedad de
las Cuentas del Gran Capitn queda en plena evidencia. Respaldar al Peso con
deuda externa (FMI) no es sano ni correcto ni ha sido una defensa efectiva
contra los ataques especulativos. Siempre terminamos ms endeudados.
<p>
 El artificio de convertir prstamos en reservas, como un
engao preelectoral no tendra mayor efecto si por el otro lado no
estuvieran aumentando la circulacin de dinero sin respaldo. En septiembre,
la Base Monetaria andaba en 47.806 millones de pesos y a finales de
diciembre estaba en 87.434 millones, un espectacular 83% de aumento. Por lo
menos necesitamos $11.000 millones propios, no prestados,  para darle un
respaldo  firme a los Pesos que andan circulando hoy en da. 
<p>
 Las Cuentas del Gran Capitn en las que el gobierno est
apostando para conservar la mayora de Congreso deben exhibirse, porque
constituye un engao premeditado con fines polticoelectorales. Ni la
fantasiosa macroeconoma est tan bien (ah vienen todos los dficits!) ni
mucho  menos ha mejorado la microeconoma real de los bolsillos y la boca de
los mexicanos. Arriesgar nuevamente al pas a una crisis recurrente mediante
gasto pblico, inflacin monetaria, ms impuestos y subsidios no slo pone
en evidencia esa incapacidad tcnica para gobernar que debe pronto terminar,
sino la inmoralidad de hacer poltica bajo la premisa de que el fin
justifica los medios.

<H2>GLOBALIZACION DE LA ECONOMIA</H2>
<p>
Luis Pazos*
<p>
CIUDAD DE MEXICO (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Hace poco una periodista me present en Panam
como  partidario de la globalizacin. Es frecuente que cuando explicamos un
fenmeno econmico, que se da independientemente de que estemos de acuerdo
con l o no, inmediatamente nos adjudican etiquetas. Lo importante para
muchos intelectuales no es explicar el fenmeno sino ubicarlo dentro de
ciertas tendencias y con base en ello aplaudirlo o criticarlo. Esa actitud
es tan absurda como acusar de partidario de las tormentas a aquel que
explica porqu llueve.
<p>
 La globalizacin no es una moda ni corresponde a un esquema neoliberal; es
producto del avance tecnolgico, fruto de las innovaciones y descubrimientos
del siglo XX.
<p>
 Bajo el trmino globalizacin entendemos el intercambio generalizado de
bienes y servicios entre pases y continentes. Hace siglos, cuando el
principal transporte era el burro o el caballo, el comercio no poda llegar
ms all de unos cuantos kilmetros a la redonda; ahora que un avin recorre
en menos de un da los puntos ms distantes del planeta tambin las
mercancas lo pueden hacer. El fax, la comunicacin va satlite, el correo
electrnico y la transferencia de fondos en unos segundos de un punto de la
tierra a otro son instrumentos que han propiciado la globalizacin de la
economa.
<p>
 Ante las tormentas y la lluvia no es relevante ser de derecha o de
izquierda, sino salir con gabardina y paraguas. Ante la globalizacin, no se
trata de estar a favor o en contra, sino de prepararse para operar
eficientemente bajo esa nueva circunstancia. Si ignoramos la lluvia, nos
mojamos. Y si como profesionales, empresarios o nacin pasamos por la alto
la globalizacin, nos quedaremos atrasados, empobrecidos y seremos desplazados.
<p>
 Desde el punto de vista profesional, la globalizacin implica un esfuerzo
adicional  para capacitarse y conocer los adelantos tecnolgicos referentes
a nuestra especialidad, no tan slo en nuestra ciudad sino de todas partes.
Como empresario es necesario identificar las tcnicas que usan no slo
nuestros competidores de la misma regin, sino de todo el mundo, con quienes
tarde o temprano estaremos compitiendo tambin. Como gobernante y poltico
significa tener en cuenta que las leyes fiscales, laborales, ecolgicas,
comerciales, industriales, etc. sern comparadas y evaluadas con respecto a
las de otros pases, y seleccionando entre las naciones que brinden mejores
condiciones los inversionistas decidirn dnde invertirn, crear empresas,
empleos y, por lo tanto, mejores niveles de vida.
<p>
 La globalizacin es la internacionalizacin de las actividades econmicas
debido a la reduccin de las distancias, de los tiempos y la simultaneidad
de la informacin a nivel mundial. No es una moda, sino un fenmeno producto
de la tecnologa en las postrimeras del siglo XX.

<H2>EL TAMAO DEL BUEN GOBIERNO</H2>
<p>
Richard Rahn*
<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- El presidente Clinton declar que haba terminado la era
del gobierno grande. Como los republicanos llevan aos argumentando que el
gobierno es demasiado grande, parece que ambos partidos ahora se pondrn de
acuerdo en reducirlo. La pregunta es cunto.
<p>
 La respuesta corta es que el gobierno debe ser entre 60% y 80% de su tamao
actual para maximizar el crecimiento econmico y el bienestar social. Las
propuestas presupuestarias de ambos partidos reconocen que el gobierno ha
crecido por encima de su tamao ptimo, pero ninguno de los dos partidos ha
hecho propuestas sobre cmo reducirlo hasta alcanzar ese tamao ptimo.
<p>
 Con el propsito de determinar ms exactamente el tamao ptimo de los
gobiernos, recientemente complet un estudio con los profesores Harrison y
Linn Fox, patrocinado por la Fundacin Krieble, que analiza la relacin
entre crecimiento econmico y el tamao del gobierno central en 57 pases,
desde 1951 hasta 1993. Incluimos todas las naciones que cuentan con
estadsticas razonablemente confiables y cuyo Producto Interno Bruto era de
ms de $5.000 millones, sin incluir aquellos cuya economa depende de
exportaciones petroleras. Utilizamos slo datos de los gobiernos centrales
porque los regionales y locales no son muy confiables en muchos pases.
<p>
 Debido a que los gobiernos locales gastan entre 5% y 15% del PIB, nuestros
resultados subestiman el tamao verdadero de los gobiernos. Por ejemplo, el
gobierno federal de Estados Unidos gast en 1996 21% del PIB, mientras que
los gobiernos locales gastaron 12%, para un total de 33%
<p>
 Encontramos que se maximiza el crecimiento econmico cuando los gastos del
gobierno central alcanzan entre 10% y 15%. Por encima de eso, la tasa de
crecimiento consistentemente se reduce a medida que crece el tamao relativo
del gobierno. Otras investigaciones recientes, utilizando cifras de Estados
Unidos, indican tambin que en este pas el tamao del gobierno est muy por
encima del ptimo que maximizara el bienestar general.
<p>
 Por ejemplo, un estudio de 1995 de la Universidad de Ohio concluye que "el
tamao ptimo del gobierno federal es alrededor de 17,6% del PIB".  La
investigacin del National Center for Policy Analysis concluye que para
"maximizar el crecimiento econmico, la combinacin de tasas de impuestos
federales, estadales y locales debe totalizar entre 21,5% y 22,9% del PIB.
Este estudio del profesor Gerald Scully implica un sector gubernamental
central de aproximadamente 15% del PIB y que el actual tamao de los
gobiernos locales son exagerados tambin.
<p>
 No es ningn misterio que los gobiernos han crecido demasiado. Los grupos
de presin siempre tendrn mayor motivacin en la exigencia de nuevos y ms
extensos programas gubernamentales que aquellos otros grupos que piden
moderacin. Los impuestos y la habilidad de endeudarse de los gobiernos
imponen costos significantes a la economa y reducen los incentivos para
trabajar, ahorrar e invertir. Los gastos gubernamentales raramente tienen
los mismos controles que caracterizan al sector privado y pocas veces estn
sujetos a rigurosos anlisis de costo/beneficio.
<p>
 El gobierno grande es un fenmeno relativamente nuevo, en gran parte
causado por la influencia de socialistas y keynesianos, quienes al contrario
de los prceres de nuestra independencia ven al gobierno como una panacea en
vez de como una amenaza. Histricamente, la participacin del gobierno en el
PIB era modesta en casi todos los pases. Un reciente estudio del FMI
muestra que en las naciones industriales ms avanzadas el gasto
gubernamental como proporcin del PIB aument de un promedio de 8,3% en 1870
a 47,2% en 1994. Para 1929, el gasto total del gobierno en Estados Unidos
era 10% del PIB y del gobierno federal un minsculo 2,6% del PIB.
<p>
 El nfasis de la accin poltica debe cambiar de la nivelacin del
presupuesto a ms bien maximizar el crecimiento econmico. La realidad es
que la clase poltica se opone a medidas en favor del crecimiento porque el
bienestar general que se lograra reduce la dependencia de aquellos que
reparten los beneficios que otros pagan. 
<p>
 Aunque podemos claramente afirmar que una reduccin significante del tamao
del gobierno aumentar substancialmente el crecimiento econmico, tambin
tenemos que estar conscientes que a muchos polticos les interesa que esto
no se sepa. Mientras los medios de comunicacin y los empresarios no estn
dispuestos a educar a la gente en este sentido, los polticos seguirn
insistiendo en perjudicarnos dndonos tanto gobierno.

<H2>PERU: APERTURA EDUCACIONAL</H2>
<p>
Jos Luis Sardn
<p>
LIMA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- En trminos polticos y econmicos, 1996 termin resultando un
mal ao para el Per. Es temprano para calcular el dao que la toma de la
residencia del embajador japons por guerrilleros del MRTA har a la
economa peruana, pero ya sabemos que en 1996 se redujo notoriamente el
impulso en los procesos de estabilizacin y reforma estructural.
<p>
 Por primera vez desde 1991, en 1996 la inflacin fue mayor a
la registrada en el ao anterior, al alcanzar alrededor de 12%. As, en el
campo fundamental de la estabilizacin macroeconmica se empieza a observar
un retroceso respecto de los notables logros obtenidos en la primera mitad
de la dcada.
<p>
En el campo de la reforma econmica es verdad que se llevaron adelante,
contra las presiones demaggicas tradicionales, algunas privatizaciones
claves, como la de PetroPer. Sin embargo, tambin es cierto que los agentes
econmicos han recibido seales confusas que desdibujan el claro perfil de
las libertades econmicas antes establecidas. Un ejemplo reciente de ello
son las marchas y contramarchas en la legislacin laboral.
<p>
 No obstante este turbio panorama, a fin del ao fue
promulgada una ley que permite alentar grandes esperanzas. Se trata del
Decreto Legislativo 882, Ley de Promocin de la Inversin en la Educacin,
la cual resumida en trminos telegrficos reintroduce los derechos de
propiedad en el sector y, por tanto, devuelve a la iniciativa privada la
responsabilidad de las decisiones bsicas del proceso educativo.
En el Per no existe sector ms intervenido por el Estado que el educativo.
A nivel de los colegios, el Ministerio de Educacin tiene todava poderes
infinitos, herencia de la dictadura militar. A nivel de las universidades,
la situacin era igualmente grave, desde que estaban sujetas a un nico y
rgido esquema legal la Ley 23733, de 1983, al que deban ajustar su
organizacin y su funcionamiento. 
<p>
 Desde tiempos del general Velasco Ibarra, el rgimen legal
de las universidades ha sido profundamente hostil a la iniciativa privada.
Siguiendo las ideas del movimiento de reforma universitaria de Crdova, de
1918, la dictadura militar instal en este mbito un modelo de organizacin
cooperativo, inspirado en el tab ideolgico segn el cual las actividades
acadmicas deben ser realizadas por instituciones no contaminadas por la
bsqueda de ganancias.
<p>
 Con decisin y coraje saludables, la nueva ley ha atacado el
problema de fondo del sector, al reconocer los derechos de propiedad de las
entidades promotoras de las instituciones educativas particulares. Al
hacerlo, les brinda una marco legal bsico que les asegura las libertades
indispensables para disponer la orientacin axiolgica, la organizacin
administrativa y el rgimen de gobierno de este tipo de instituciones.
As, pues, ya no sern los expertos reales o supuestos del Ministerio de
Educacin quienes tomen las decisiones claves vinculadas al proceso
educativo. Tampoco sern los cuerpos colectivos asamblesticos, con sus
tortuosos procedimientos de votacin annima, perfectamente irresponsables.
Ahora stas correspondern a quienes invierten y arriesgan sus recursos
personales o familiares en instituciones educativas particulares.
<p>
 Al atreverse a romper prejuicios viejos y profundamente
arraigados en la sociedad peruana, el actual rgimen ha dado muestras de una
importante capacidad para reinventarse a s mismo. Viendo la evolucin del
proceso poltico peruano en una amplia perspectiva, y recordando los muchos
sufrimientos y esfuerzos que ha costado llegar al punto en el que ahora
estamos, cabe desear que esta ley nos augure un mejor 1997.

<H2>DESARROLLO SOSTENIBLE</H2>
<p>
James M. Sheehan*
<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- El "desarrollo sostenible" es la razn de ser de
numerosos tratados y convenciones de las Naciones Unidas. Se trata del
pretexto ambiental para ampliar el poder de las burocracias nacionales e
internacionales en controlar la economa. Este tipo de planificacin central
se considera esencial para evitar que se agoten los recursos naturales y
para prevenir la contaminacin y la destruccin de la diversidad biolgica.
Los defensores del desarrollo sostenible exigen el establecimiento de un
marco de restricciones generales a las libertades individuales y econmicas,
al comercio, al progreso econmico y tecnolgico, a la agricultura.
<p>
 El desarrollo sostenible se fundamente  en la idea de que la globalizacin
de la tecnologa y del crecimiento econmico son inherentemente destructivos
del medio ambiente. Sin embargo,  las habituales predicciones apocalpticas
sobre la extincin de recursos naturales nunca han resultado ciertas. Los
crticos del capitalismo no toman en cuenta sus poderosas fuerzas
innovadoras. En un mercado libre, los empresarios compiten en desarrollar
soluciones eficientes, a bajos costos, para enfrentar problemas de escasez
de recursos, permitiendo que la gente haga ms con menos. El capitalismo ha
producido mayor nmero de innovaciones beneficiosas al medio ambiente que
cualquier otro sistema econmico. Aunque tal dinmica no existe en las
economas socialistas, las propuestas para un desarrollo sostenible se
copian la planificacin central socialista.

 La influyente Cumbre de Ro de 1992 defini el desarrollo sostenible como
el principio fundamental de la poltica ambiental mundial. Desde entonces,
burcratas internacionales, activistas ambientales y funcionarios de
gobiernos nacionales han desarrollado un creciente cuerpo de leyes
internacionales que incluyen tratados y acuerdos como la Agenda 21, la
Convencin Climtica Mundial, la Convencin de Biodiversidad y el Tratado de
los Ocanos. Estos tratados imponen costosas regulaciones y mayores gastos
estatales en programas derrochadores de ayuda internacional. Tales
transferencias se canalizan a travs de la Agencia para Desarrollo
Internacional del Departamento de Estado, la Facilidad Ambiental del Banco
Mundial y varias agencias de la ONU. Se trata del comienzo de un plan
ambiental centralizado.
<p>
 Las iniciativas ambientales promulgadas bajo el pretexto del desarrollo
sostenible tambin amenazan el futuro econmico de las naciones en
desarrollo. "Ecoimperialismo" es una nueva tendencia bajo la cual las
naciones industrializadas imponen nuevas normas ambientales al resto del
mundo. Las naciones en desarrollo, con las poblaciones ms pobres, son las
que ms sufren por tales restricciones. Estos pases temen que sus esfuerzos
por salir de la pobreza sean proscritos como "ambientalmente insostenibles"
por los pases industrializados, los cuales no enfrentaron las mismas
prohibiciones cuando avanzaban en su propio desarrollo.
<p>
 Los patrocinadores del desarrollo sostenible no ven el papel que juega la
pobreza en la degradacin ambiental. Las sociedades ricas gastan recursos
voluntariamente en mejorar la calidad ambiental, sin coercin gubernamental,
pero las naciones pobres no pueden darse ese lujo. Los habitantes de
naciones pobres son ms vulnerables a enfermedades, desastres naturales y
deficiencias alimentarias; ms de dos millones de personas mueren cada ao
por falta de salubridad bsica. Por lo tanto, una poltica mundial que
restrinja el desarrollo econmico bajo el pretexto de la "sustentacin" har
dao tanto a la gente como al medio ambiente.
<p>
 La historia nos muestra que la planificacin central caus una severa
degradacin ambiental en la antigua Unin Sovitica. Y la calidad ambiental
es un asunto local, no global, por lo que una exagerada centralizacin hara
ms dao que bien. Lo lgico es que las naciones compitan entre s con
diferentes enfoques. Los pases que efectivamente desregulan sus economas
tienden a promover ms rpidamente su desarrollo econmico, instrumentan
tecnologas ms limpias y crean la riqueza que har luego posible mejorar el
medio ambiente.
<p>
La bsqueda del "desarrollo sostenible" a travs de la expansin de la
autoridad reguladora y de burocracias internacionales conducirn
inevitablemente a fracasos econmicos y ambientales. El verdadero desarrollo
sostenible puede ser alcanzado slo por medio de las instituciones del
mercado: derechos de propiedad, intercambio voluntario y seguridad jurdica.

<H2>REFORMAS INCOMPLETAS EN AMERICA LATINA</H2>
<p>
Alvaro Vargas-Llosa*
<p>
LONDRES (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- "El manual del perfecto idiota latinoamericano" ha sido un
xito de librera en toda Amrica Latina. All los autores, utilizando algo
de humor, tratamos de destacar la incapacidad de nuestra clase poltica e
intelectual de renunciar a viejos mitos que por muchos aos han dado
explicaciones erradas a nuestras miserias.
<p>
 Pero el libro tambin desafa ese nuevo y peligroso mito que sostiene que
en Amrica Latina se est viviendo una revolucin de libre mercado. Es un
peligro grave y latente que ese valeroso pero limitado experimento
reformista -reduciendo la inflacin y el nmero de empresas estatales, a la
vez que muestra cierta hospitalidad hacia el inversionista extranjero- est
reanimando la oposicin populista y debilitando la economa de mercado
precisamente porque se trata de reformas incompletas.
<p>
 Si menos empresas estatales, menor inflacin y mayor inversin extranjera
fuesen suficientes para lograr estabilidad y prosperidad -un vuelco al
capitalismo- entonces Amrica Latina sera ya prspera desde hace tiempo.
Tuvimos tiempos, antes de la ola estatista, cuando la poltica monetaria no
estuvo frenticamente fuera de control. En esa poca, la inversin
extranjera se vea por todas partes; tanto que todas nuestras revoluciones
socialistas -desde Mxico en 1910,  Bolivia en 1952, Cuba en 1959 y Per en
1968- llegaron al poder en nombre de la "soberana". Pero la miseria persisti.
<p>
 Si una eficiencia macroeconmica fuera suficiente para lograr una sociedad
libre y prspera, porqu sigue Amrica Latina atrasada a pesar de haber
crecido a un promedio de 5% anual desde 1940, un crecimiento superior al
europeo en el mismo perodo?
<p>
 La respuesta es que las reformas parciales, concentradas en el manejo
macroeconmico, sin un claro compromiso con los derechos de propiedad,
mercados competitivos y slidas instituciones judiciales y polticas
conducen a sistemas mercantilistas que le niegan a las mayoras las
oportunidades y los beneficios del crecimiento econmico.
<p>
 Dos grandes debilidades afectan el actual proceso de reforma
latinoamericano. La primera es que se confunde a la empresa privada con el
capitalismo de libre mercado. La segunda es que el nfasis es en el manejo
macroeconmico, sin tomar en consideracin el orden institucional. 
<p>
 Las privatizaciones no son panaceas. Privatizaciones mal concebidas han
reemplazado monopolios pblicos con monopolios privados, transfiriendo la
propiedad mientras se protege el mercado y se fomenta escandalosamente la
corrupcin. Un ejemplo son las telecomunicaciones. Por toda Amrica Latina
los usuarios sufren de altas tarifas y mal servicio porque las empresas
telefnicas se vendieron a monopolios privados. Esto resulta obvio en Per,
Mxico y Argentina. Entonces los usuarios concluyen que el capitalismo, no
su ausencia, es la causa de tales abusos. No comprenden que eso es lo que
sucede cada vez que se transfieren mercados cerrados del control pblico al
privado.
<p>
 Problemas similares ocurren en gran variedad de servicios. El transporte
pblico en Buenos Aires est en manos privadas, pero cada ruta es un
monopolio de alguna empresa, por lo cual los argentinos estn en contra de
la privatizacin.
<p>
 Esos desaciertos son utilizados por los enemigos de las reformas, como el
poderoso sindicato colombiano de las telecomunicaciones que controla a la
mayora de los 14 mil empleados de la compaa de telfonos colombiana. En
su oposicin a la privatizacin, el sindicato apunta los defectos del
monopolio telefnico privado en Per.
<p>
 Esta proteccin de monopolios tambin crea la percepcin que liberalizacin
significa conceder privilegios a los ricos. Los 15 mexicanos que aparecen
entre los hombres ms ricos del mundo se beneficiaron de privilegios
concedidos por el estado. A su vez, el pueblo mexicano tiene pocas razones
para apoyar un proceso que los ha empobrecido.
<p>
 Por todo el continente se mantienen sectores intocables, llamados
estratgicos. El mejor ejemplo es el petrleo. En Venezuela, a pesar de los
fenomenales $250 mil millones generados en los ltimos 20 aos por su
monopolio estatal petrolero, se estima que 80% de la poblacin vive por
debajo del nivel de pobreza. Sin embargo, sugerencias sobre la privatizacin
del petrleo es respondida histricamente, como sucede tambin en Mxico y
con Codelco en Chile.
<p>
 Amrica Latina ha ignorado olmpicamente la importancia de instituciones
tales como la justicia, la propiedad privada, monedas slidas y hasta la
misma democracia. El resultado es un proceso de reformas con bases dbiles
que invitan al desastre.
<p>
 La falta de reforma institucional est muy extendido. Los derechos de
propiedad no se toman en cuenta o son evadidos por el gobierno. Durante los
aos 80, en un proceso silencioso, los campesinos peruanos de hecho
privatizaron 60% de las tierras que haban sido colectivizadas por una
reforma agraria socialista en los aos 70. Sin embargo, cuatro millones de
parceleros andinos todava no tienen sus ttulos de propiedad.
<p>
 En Mxico, el derecho de propiedad difcilmente existe con el artculo 27
de la Constitucin que mantiene que "la nacin" es la duea de todas las
tierras. La muy mentada reforma del ejido no se ha traducido en derechos de
propiedad para los campesinos. No es posible confiar en las instituciones
peruanas luego que el presidente disolvi al Poder Judicial en 1992,
reemplazndolo por otro polticamente subordinado. Esa institucin no evit
que el Per, segn el informe de Amnista Internacional de 1996, se
convirtiera en el pas en Amrica Latina con ms presos polticos -unos
1.100- despus de Cuba. En Amrica Latina se aparta la libertad econmica de
su esencial base poltica e institucional.
<p>
 En Amrica Latina jams se ha intentado una reforma liberal. El idiota
latinoamericano   siempre atribuye nuestros fracasos a conspiraciones: la
Doctrina Monroe, la United Fruit, el FMI, el Banco Mundial. El ltimo
enemigo es el neoliberalismo, o sea las reformas de libre mercado.
Nuevamente se apunta donde no es.

<H2>LAS MENTIRAS ACADEMICAS</H2>
<p>
Walter Williams*
<p>
FAIRFAX, VIRGINIA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Muchos ejecutivos de empresas se preguntan cmo
es que tantos de sus empleados que se han graduado de universidades no son
capaces de escribir un memorndum, hacer algunos clculos sencillos o pensar
y expresarse lgicamente. Aqu les doy una muy pequea parte de la
respuesta, contndoles sobre un reciente evento "educacional" en mi universidad.
<p>
 El Centro de Servicio Educacional y de Liderazgo Estudiantil de la
Universidad George Mason distribuy invitaciones para la "Cena del Hambre",
un evento promocionado como educacional "para la comunidad estudiantil
acerca del efecto dramtico del hambre a nivel mundial. La cena dramatiza la
desigual distribucin de recursos como elemento que contribuye al hambre" y
la velada prometa promover "el anlisis crtico, analtico e imaginativo
sobre los que basar decisiones ticas".
<p>
 Luego de donar dos latas de sopa o $3, a cada estudiante asistente a la
cena se le daba un boleto. El color del boleto que a cada uno, por suerte,
le tocaba indicaba su categora en la cena. A 16 estudiantes le tocaron
boletos del "Primer Mundo" y ellos fueron conducidos formalmente a una mesa
cubierta con un mantel de hilo y adornada con flores, donde disfrutaron de
una cena de cuatro deliciosos platos, mientras escuchaban msica clsica
interpretada por un do de flauta y oboe. Se les dijo que ellos
representaban al 15% de los habitantes de Estados Unidos, a los ricos.
<p>
 A otros 30 estudiantes le tocaron boletos del "Segundo Mundo". Comieron
hamburguesas con papitas fritas en platos de plstico y mesas sin mantel.
Les dijeron ser los representantes del 25% de la poblacin que apenas logra
cubrir sus necesidades bsicas.
<p>
 Los 140 estudiantes con boletos del "Tercer Mundo" recibieron un vaso de
agua y media taza de arroz, para que lo comieran con las manos, sentados en
el suelo. Se les inform que representaban a los pobres, 60% de la poblacin
de Estados Unidos. 
<p>
 Un conferencista de la Coalicin de los Sintecho expuso que el hambre y la
falta de viviendas se debe a la poca construccin a precios razonables que
hay, a falta de empleos que paguen salarios aceptables y a falta de
servicios de salud a precios asequibles. Tambin dijo a los estudiantes que
Estados Unidos tiene suficientes recursos para acabar con la pobreza, pero
prefiere dedicarlos a gastos de defensa.
<p>
 Este evento, tpico entre muchos otros que a diario se montan en nuestras
universidades, no fue ms que propaganda, indoctrinacin y mentiras
dirigidas a mentes jvenes ya repletas de falsos sentimentalismos. La parte
ms insidiosa fue la que fomenta la envidia. Darle agua y arroz al 60% de
los asistentes, con el mensaje de que ellos representaban a los pobres de
Estados Unidos, es repugnante.
<p>
 Los hechos son diferentes. Los pobres en este pas son 14%. La obesidad es
un mayor problema nutricional entre los estadounidenses pobres que la
flacura. Los pobres de Estados Unidos comen ms carne y tienen ms espacio
en sus viviendas que los europeos de clase media. En 1993, los gastos del
gobierno federal, estadal y local para combatir la pobreza ascendieron a
$324.000 millones, mientras que el costo de la defensa nacional fue $291.000
millones.
<p>
 Para completar una velada de propaganda poltica, la medicina socializada
del Canad fue presentada como el mejor ejemplo a seguir. Nadie mencion a
los pacientes canadienses que cruzan la frontera para ser tratados en
hospitales estadounidenses ni el hecho de que cualquier ciudad grande de
Estados Unidos tiene ms equipo mdico moderno que todo el Canad.
<p>
 Este centro propagandstico en mi universidad es apenas una pequea muestra
del creciente equipo de indoctrinacin presente en nuestras casas de
estudios, con el fin de confundir y engaar a nuestra juventud, promoviendo
la lucha de clases. Esto sucede por dos razones: la generacin de Woodstock
ocupa hoy los cargos administrativos, mientras que los sndicos elegidos
para supervisar las instituciones universitarias no estn cumpliendo con sus
obligaciones.

COMERCIO LIBRE O MANIPULADO
</H2>
Carlos A. Ball*
<br>
<p>
MIAMI (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)
 (AIPE).- Los beneficiarios del libre comercio son los consumidores,
quienes entonces gozan de libre acceso a los mejores y ms baratos productos
y servicios de todo el mundo. Los enemigos son los empresarios ineficientes
que no pueden competir, los sindicatos de industrias que por sus altos
costos hacen mal uso de escasos recursos y los polticos intervencionistas
que reciben contribuciones y apoyo electoral de quienes se oponen al libre
comercio.
<P>
 En los ltimos tiempos ha surgido un poderoso nuevo enemigo: grupos
ecolgicos activistas que ven la industrializacin como la peor amenaza a
sus utpicos deseos de que no hayan cambios en la naturaleza. Son grupos ms
preocupados por la supervivencia de insectos que por el bienestar y
crecimiento econmico de seres humanos que habitan sus adorados desiertos,
pantanos y junglas. Si en el siglo pasado estos grupos ambientalistas
hubieran tenido el poder poltico que hoy gozan en Estados Unidos y el apoyo
econmico de multimillonarias fundaciones privadas, este pas no se hubiera
industrializado y a lo mejor hubieran logrado devolverle Manhattan a los
indios. Ellos se han convertido en los peores y ms fuertes enemigos del
desarrollo latinoamericano, ahora que el nacionalismo socialista est en
evidente decadencia.
<P>
 Los aranceles y dems barreras al libre intercambio comercial perjudican al
consumidor nacional, aunque con ello los polticos y burcratas pretenden
perjudicar al empresario extranjero, en beneficio del empresario local.
Siendo esto as, lo lgico sera que los polticos eliminaran todas las
barreras al ingreso de productos y servicios extranjeros, pero ello va
contra su fibra dirigista, su desconfianza en el mercado que no es ms que
desconfianza en la habilidad del pueblo de tomar sus propias decisiones y,
sobre todo, no quieren perder la habilidad de castigar o complacer a
enemigos y amigos, que es lo que en realidad coloca poder en sus manos.
<P>
 El TLC/NAFTA ha sido un xito a medias. Sus diseadores quisieron estar
bien con Dios y con el diablo. Se abren las fronteras, pero si los precios
baratos de tomates y aguacates mexicanos afectan a agricultores
estadounidenses se aplican excepciones al tratado. Despus de todo, las amas
de casa aqu no van a chillar porque los tomates les cuesten diez centavos
ms, pero los agricultores s pusieron el grito en el cielo ante esa
"injusta" competencia. Lo mismo pasa con los transportistas mexicanos, a
quienes se les sigue prohibiendo entregar mercanca ms ac de la frontera,
en defensa de los intereses del sindicato de camioneros norteamericano. Eso,
claro est, no es libre comercio sino manipulacin poltica electorera.
<P>
 Un interesante informe secreto del Banco Mundial se filtr recientemente a
la prensa y deja muy mal parado al supuestamente exitoso Mercosur, donde lo
mismo que en el TLC/NAFTA lejos de reducirse unilateralmente los aranceles
se construy un inmenso mamotreto artificial, para proteger los intereses
empresariales ms poderosos en Brasil, Argentina, Uruguay y Paraguay. El
intercambio comercial aument de $4.200 millones en 1990 a $12.300 millones
en 1994 entre los cuatro pases, pero resulta que el grueso de ese aumento
ha sido en vehculos y maquinaria agrcola que antes se importaban, a
mejores precios, de Asia, Europa y Norteamrica, pero que ahora provienen de
ineficientes fabricantes argentinos y brasileos.
<P>
 El proteccionismo regional, que es el objetivo de los burcratas que se
pasan la vida en los mejores hoteles del mundo negociando acuerdos
bilaterales, representa apenas una leve mejora sobre el proteccionismo
nacional. Las cuotas de importacin y altos aranceles impuestos por Mercosur
lograron que el comercio intra-regional en vehculos aumentara de $207
millones en 1988 a $2.100 millones en 1994, pero con ello se termina
perjudicando su capacidad interna de competir con el  mundo exterior, ya que
los altos precios de vehculos y maquinarias aumentan los costos de
produccin de los miembros de Mercosur.
<P>
 Esto es lo que los economistas llaman "desviacin" del comercio. Los
paraguayos preferiran comprar carros buenos y baratos de Corea en lugar de
modelos viejos y caros de la Argentina. Pero la industria automotor en la
Argentina y Brasil es muy poderosa polticamente, determinando muchas de las
decisiones de Mercosur. Existe algo ms potencialmente peligroso que un
poltico intervencionista local: un burcrata intervencionista
supranacional. Por ello, los ambientalistas enfilan sus campaas hacia las
Naciones Unidas y dems agencias multilaterales.

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Ted Van Dyk is a former Washington State resident</B> and
a Democrat of national pedigree, who once served as an aide to Vice President
Hubert Humphrey, later ran a Democratic policy center and advised Sen. Paul
Tsongas in his 1992  presidential bid. These days he gazes balefully over
developments in the Whitewater scandal as described in the newspapers that
arrive daily in his Washington, D.C. office; and he asks rhetorically, what
is the likely outcome of this seemingly endless mess? <BR>
<BR>
Consider this scenario, he suggests: Bill Clinton, like Richard Nixon in
1972, wins big in November, and next February independent counsel Kenneth
Starr announces an indictment. The country and the Congress are thrown into
an uproar. It's Watergate all over again and the people demand to know why
the facts had not been presented to them when they could have exercised
their own judgment at the polls. <BR>
<BR>
Now picture a second scenario: Clinton wins, but narrowly. Then the independent
counsel announces that he has found, in the familiar term of art, &quot;insufficient
grounds to prosecute.&quot; The White House and Democrats are outraged that
they have had to put up with the character issue hanging over their heads,
when an earlier resolution could have spared the President and maybe Democrats
in Congress a lot of anxiety, and maybe given them a larger mandate. <BR>
<BR>
In scenario three, the current steady erosion of news stories--Mrs. Clinton
cited for failure to report her role in the Castle Grande real estate deal,
talk of pardoning the McDougals, and what have you--take their silent toll.
Dole wins narrowly. Then, the independent counsel reports around inaugural
time that he is indicting the soon-to-be-retired Clintons. More distress,
including Republican indignation that this information was not available
at a time when it could have led to a more substantial GOP victory. <BR>
<BR>
Or, four, a narrow Dole victory is followed by a decision by the independent
counsel not to indict. Outgoing President Clinton is relieved, but angry.
This decision earlier could have saved the election for him and helped the
Democrats in Congress. The process has triumphed over justice once again.
(Van Dyk thinks the chances of indictment overall are 50-50.) <BR>
<BR>
In short, the Whitewater scandal and the investigation attending it have
dragged on so long now that it is hard to conceive of an outcome that truly
serves the nation&iacute;s interest. In 1992 the scandal was new, poorly
reported and had no effect on the election. Later, as Travelgate and other
mini-scandals developed, it was assumed that appointment of an independent
counsel (two, as it turned out) would get to the bottom of the matter and
clear it up, one way or another. Yet here we are, going through yet another
election where Whitewater and related matters whistle around the campaign
like a nasty ditty voters hate but can't get out of their heads. <BR>
<BR>
The assumption has been that because people are fatigued with Whitewater
and related matters, they also are unaware and unaffected. In fact, voters
know that questions of tax evasion, obstruction of justice and perjury are
serious, but they don't know how to assess them. In surveys, the results
are strange, and Charles E. Cook in the Capitol Hill newspaper, <I>Roll
Call,</I> is not alone in saying that he has never seen such volatility.
Consider this exotic syllogism: a) a majority of people believe &quot;character&quot;
is important in a president; b) a majority thinks Dole is far superior to
Clinton on this count, and c) a majority plans to vote for Clinton. <BR>
<BR>
If that kind of survey is accurate, does it suggest, as some say, that the
American people have lost their moral bearings? Not necessarily. It may
suggest that people have other things on their minds, and, in any case,
prefer to give the Clintons the benefit of the doubt until hard evidence
of wrongdoing is presented. Who can blame them? Theirs actually seems like
a very sensible attitude. <BR>
<BR>
For one thing, who can remember all the chapters in the Whitewater saga
as it courses through Arkansas and Washington, D.C., let alone the details?
Few Democratic leaders in Congress or elsewhere are visibly defending the
Clintons on Whitewater, yet the Dole campaign is staying away from the subject,
too. Maybe no one can follow it all. <BR>
<BR>
Of course, there are many other, on-the-record reasons for a vote against
Clinton and for Dole (and vice versa), but they are the old, standard liberal
versus conservative arguments that have divided the parties for sixty odd
years. You don't have to have Whitewater splashed in your face. Not on the
evidence so far. <BR>
<BR>
Van Dyk, who over the past few years became a public critic of Bill Clinton's
character (&quot;I believe he is badly flawed.&quot;), is now frustrated
with the failure of the independent counsel to come to a conclusion in a
timely fashion that would allow a political resolution rather than risk
a constitutional crisis. A partisan Democrat, he is foremost concerned for
the country. <BR>
<BR>
Prosecutors, he notes, always think of building as strong a case as possible
before he takes action. Let justice takes its course. But there comes a
point where more is at stake than a trial--like the future of the nation.
Thus, Van Dyk now concludes that if Ken Starr is going to bring charges,
he has an obligation to do it before election day. Otherwise, he should
drop it.<BR>
<BR>
Think about the grave implications of either course. Someone should.

<BODY>


<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>I've changed my
treadmill schedule from the evening, when I watched "The News Hour with Jim
Lehrer," to the morning so I can get a sampling of the talk-show fare and stay in
touch with "real people" outside Washington. No offense to Jim Lehrer, but I can
watch him at night without the help of endorphins.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But if my morning energy
level has gone up, my tolerance for talk television has sharply declined. In the weeks
since I began surfing for the morning shows the absolute worst, yet quite typical,
was about identical 10-year-old twins. Two girls and two boys were videotaped by
their parents showing how nasty they could be to each other, kicking and biting and
pulling each other's hair. Then we meet the twins live, in the television studio, to
hear and see them tell the audience why they hate one another. Each boy and girl
wish they weren't stuck with a horrible double.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>To give this junk morally
redeeming value, we're told that after the commercial break these twins are going
to want to shape up and learn the meaning of brotherly (or sisterly) love. When we
return we're introduced to the tutors for the twins.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>One is a tragic mother
who ran over her son, a twin, when he was 4 years old. She didn't see him as she
backed the van out of the driveway. She felt a bump and wondered if she had hit the
dog. She thought both boys were asleep upstairs in their room. Her son, sitting by her
side, describes almost inaudibly how lonely he is and wishes he could bring his
brother back. By now everybody is crying, the twins, their mothers and the audience.
I confess, me too.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>I've written about child abuse on television before and
this time I'm not even going to castigate the hosts of such shows. They only offer
what the guests and the public of the idiot culture will bear. But what can we say
about the exploitative parents of these children? Do they have no
responsibility?<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Maybe less should be written about the effects of television
sex and violence on children and more about the ill effects of putting children on
display before the cameras. This is a long way from "Sesame Street" or silly home
videos.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>We eagerly write child labor laws. We lock up pornographic
photographers of children. Isn't it obscene to portray children violently taunting
each other in scenes of sibling rivalry and then on cue parade their feelings before
their friends and millions of others?<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The last time I complained about child
abuse on television, it occurred on a show where children, ages 6 and 9, were trotted
out to explain how and why they wanted to kill their mothers. Greek tragedy this
was not.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The hosts usually make a pretense of offering such families "a
therapeutic environment," with bright lights and microphones, lots of supportive
gasps, sympathetic applause, and of course ample commercial breaks. Frequently a
resident expert is recruited to say that killing mothers is bad for their health, or
that beating up a sibling is not nice, either.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>These shows are sometimes
defended as "the democratization of culture," a harmless low-brow pleasure -- like
watching Christians being fed to lions? Or defended as giving those who don't have
much to feel good about an opportunity to feel superior to someone else: At least my
kids don't want to kill me or each other! They've even been called popular theater
with an Aristotelian catharsis: There but for the grace of God and television
producers, go I.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But no matter how you look at it from an audience's point of
view, the children placed in front of that camera are abused children. We should
worry about the psychological impact on their lives.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Now that we've bid our
farewell to Phil Donahue, who started this abuse, we can wax nostalgic about a more
innocent time when the host merely wore a skirt and brought male strippers into our
homes. Tastelessness beats beating up kids.<P><I>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for

The stern rebuke of<BR>a Sunday-school boy
</FONT></center>

<BR><DD>To everything a season, to quote the forbidden texts, and that includes even politics. If you wait long enough, the wheel comes 'round.

<BR><DD>Only nine presidential campaigns ago, the elites of media and academe were aghast at the redneck notion, propagated by the lesser fundamentalist tribes, that the pope and his Roman legions would impose the morality of a foreign church on America if Americans were foolish enough to elect John F. Kennedy.

<BR><DD>Voting for the Catholic candidate thus became something close to a civic duty for the enlightened American. The enlightened elites of course never imagined that anyone as smart and as attractive as a Kennedy actually believed any of that religious stuff, just as the enlightened elites never imagined that Martin Luther King and his fellow clergymen in the civil-rights movement were men of actual faith. In 1965, when I asked to interview Dr. King and said that I wanted to talk about faith as well as politics, he invited me to lunch in New York. &quot;I thought no one would ever ask,&quot; he told me, and a promised 30 minutes stretched into the mellow gloaming of late afternoon, long past the ham sandwiches at his desk, and we talked about how faith in Christ must guide every step in a believer's life.

<BR><DD>Ah, but now the enlightened elites are not so sure.

<BR><DD>Just when they thought the streets - or at least the power positions in the culture - were safe for atheists and pagans, witches and wizards and assorted lesser geeks, along comes something barbaric and grotesque like President Clinton's veto of the partial-birth abortion bill. Suddenly the priests and preachers and rabbis think they have something to say that the rest of us ought to hear.

<BR><DD>Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York, a Catholic and a Republican who usually supports secular Democratic positions (and whose efforts at raising well-behaved children have been mixed), was one of the first to tell Pope John Paul II to butt out of the moral argument. &quot;Such direct involvement in politics is not a good idea, because I think it confuses people.&quot;

<BR><DD>This is an odd view, that politicians and not priests should declaim on moral issues, and that when priests want to say something about moral issues they should be careful not to offend the politicians.

<BR><DD>The partial-birth abortion procedure is certainly a moral issue, though the Ministry of Euphemy has already decreed that it must be called &quot;intact dilation and evacuation,&quot; or &quot;late-term abortion,&quot; which is somewhat like calling the District of Columbia &quot;an interesting experiment in local government.&quot; But you may have noticed that the media have already taken the cue.

<BR><DD>This particular abortion, on a whole baby in the act of being born, is so gruesome, so cruel, so like something from the Manual of Procedure at Auschwitz, that the vicars of the Catholic Church, beginning with the vicar of Rome, have suspended their usual reticence at involving themselves in American electoral politics to tell Bill Clinton that he blundered in behalf of the forces of darkness.

<BR><DD>Cardinal John O'Connor of New York departed from his sermon during Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral to rebuke those who, like His Honor the mayor, denounced the pope for sticking his nose in what the mayor insists is only the business of politicians.

<BR><DD>Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston, appearing on the David Brinkley program, repeated for television what he had said earlier, that if a public official finds an irresolvable conflict between his conscience - the president has said that he personally finds this abortion procedure repugnant - and public service he should resign.

<BR><DD>&quot;I think that's rather straightforward,&quot; the cardinal said. &quot;It means what it says. I believe that an individual has an obligation to follow his or her own conscience, and I don't think any of us would want to be served by persons who don't do that.&quot;

<BR><DD>Well, of course no one could imagine that he had Bill Clinton in mind as a man conflicted by demands of duty and conscience, but it is curious that a pol as attuned to the political uses of public worship could have made such a miscalculation. Bill Clinton, after all, is the man who, after losing his first bid for re-election as governor of Arkansas, suddenly joined the largest Baptist church in Arkansas, which telecasts its Sunday morning services, and joined the choir on the assurance that he could sing from a position at the preacher's right hand, in full view of the camera at all times.

<BR><DD>Some cynical people have noted that now, since it has become clear that Baptists and other evangelicals aren't likely to do doodly-squat for him in November, he has abandoned his church for Hillary's Methodist congregation, one of the most liberal in town. This is, of course, merely another of those Arkansas coincidences.

<CENTER><H3> End Federally Funded Abortion</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  There are 13 appropriations bills that fund U.S. government agencies and pro-grams.  These bills are voted on annually, and they originate in the House of Representatives.  During the Clinton administration, federal money has been used directly or indirectly for abortion through various appropriations.  The 104th Congress, however, has the opportunity to delete this funding or restore previous restrictions on tax dollars paying for abortion.  Also, the House Leadership has instructed the appropriations subcommittees to cut funding for programs that have not been "reauthorized" or approved by separate legislative committees.  For example, the Title X family planning program has not been reauthorized since 1985, but it continues to receive funding through the appropriations process.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The chairman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee is Rep. Bob Livingston (R-LA).  However, legislative action takes place first in various Appropriations subcommittees that have jurisdiction over the particular department or programs.  The sub-committee chairman plays a key role and can include the desired language in the subcommittee "mark", or bill.  A subcommittee version goes to the full committee for consideration and then to the House floor.  The key subcommittees and chairmen are:  Labor/HHS/Education (Rep. John Porter [R-Ill.]); Treasury, Postal Service, General Government (Rep. Jim Lightfoot [R-Iowa]); and District of Columbia (Rep. Jim Walsh [R-N.Y.]).
	<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Since the government's new fiscal year begins on October 1, these bills will be in the forefront during the next few months.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  
<P>
<UL> 
<LI>The current Hyde amendment applies only to programs under the jurisdiction of the Department of Health and Human Services, such as Medicaid.  The Hyde language was "expanded" in 1993 to include payment for abortions in the case of rape and incest.  The fiscal year 1995 Labor/HHS bill contained this language.
<P>
<LI>A key issue to be decided will be language introduced by Rep. Ernest Istook (R-OK) that blocks the Clinton administration's interpretation of the "expanded" Hyde language.  Under that interpretation, the state pays for poor women's abortions whenever the abortionist claims the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest.  Many states have stricter policies, allowing payment only in the case where the mother's life is endangered.  Rep. Istook tried to offer this corrective amendment during the "first 100 days" of Congress, but was persuaded not to and was promised a vote later in the year.
<P>
<LI>Also, attempts will be made to cut funding via the National Institutes for Health for human fetal tissue research, human embryo research, and RU-486 research.  Furthermore, Rep. Tom DeLay may offer an amendment to eliminate Title X family planning, which funds Planned Parenthood and distributes contraceptives to teens without parental permission.   The Senate Budget Resolution recommended defunding the Office of Surgeon General.  If the Appropriations Committee follows through, Dr. Henry Foster will have no job as Surgeon General, whether or not he is confirmed by the Senate. 
<P>
<LI>The Fiscal Year 1995 appropriations for Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government did not contain language prohibiting participating health plans from paying for Federal employees' abortions through the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHBP) program.  FEHBP provides health care benefits for 9 million federal employees.  The government (taxpayers) pays about 60 percent of the cost and the employee pays the rest.  In previous years, the Smith/Ashbrook amendment had been attached which restricted FEHBP-participating health plans from funding abortion.  This language should be reinstated.
<P>
<LI>The Fiscal Year 1995 District of Columbia appropriations contains a prohibition on the use of  "federal" funds to pay for abortions, which is meaningless, since DC can use "local"  funds.  These funds are commingled with federal funds since DC's funds are appropriated by the U.S. Congress.  Language is needed to ban all congressionally appropriated funds, both "federal" and "local," for abortion on demand in the nation's capital, a city where the number of abortions is comparable to the number of live births.
</UL><P>
<B> PROSPECTS:  </B> Majority support should be there for these appropriations bills in the House, but that will not be the case in the Senate.  In the first test vote on abortion in the House on May 24, the pro-life position (an amendment offered to the foreign aid bill by Rep. Chris Smith) prevailed by 59 votes.  President Clinton must sign the appropriations bills if he wants the money to run the government for fiscal year 1996.  

<P>
<LI><B> Prohibit D & X Abortions</B>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  To ban a particularly heinous method used to perform late-term "partial birth" abortions carried out on unborn children as early as 20 weeks of gestation and as late as 32 weeks.   
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.), Chairman of the House Subcommittee on the Constitution, along with Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) will introduce legislation in early June to ban "partial birth" abortions, or as they are more commonly known, "dilation and extraction" or "D & X" abortions.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The House Subcommittee on the Constitution held a hearing on June 15 which focused on the D & X abortion procedure, fetal pain, and a constitutional analysis of the legislation.   
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  American Medical News, (July 5, 1993) devoted a front-page article to the gruesome D & X abortion procedure.  The article explained the step-by-step procedure.  First, the unborn baby's legs are pulled into the birth canal.  Next, the abortionist delivers the baby's entire body, except for the head.  The abortionist jams scissors into the baby's head, inserts a catheter and sucks the brains out.  The dead baby is then "evacuated."  
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  As a starting point, this legislation seeks to build public support for further prohibitions and an ultimate ban on all elective (non-life-of-the-mother) abortions.  While specifically intending to prohibit late-term abortions, this legislation and corresponding Congressional hearings will educate the public about the humanity of the unborn child and the horror of abortion.  Sadly, this basic public education is still greatly needed.  There should be widespread support for this measure, although some will argue that abortion is legal and that this is not a common procedure because late-term abortions are "rare."
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Retain Forced-Abortion Asylum Policy </H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Language included in the pending foreign aid and State Department reauthorization bill (H.R. 1561) would reinstate a Reagan-Bush policy that provided asylum to those who can prove a well-founded fear of persecution for resisting the People's Republic of China's grotesque and coercive population control program. 
<P>
<B> BILL AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) added this language to the foreign aid bill when it was before the International Operations and Human Rights Subcommittee in May.  Rep. Smith is the subcommittee chairman.  The provision remained intact throughout the full committee's deliberations and became part of the foreign aid bill, known as the American Overseas Interests Act (H.R. 1561), to be considered by the House of Representatives. 
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Col.) will likely seek to delete this key provision on the House floor when the House resumes consideration of H.R. 1561.  
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Despite fears by some anti-immigration groups that the number of immigrants entering this country will soar, it is important to note that from 1987 through 1993, when the forced-abortion asylum policy was in effect, less than 200 people per year were granted asylum on these grounds.  This is a humanitarian policy and should be reinstated.  President Clinton revoked this pro-life policy soon after he took office.  This policy has real implications for Chinese families living in the U.S. who face imminent deportation and persecution, if it is not adopted quickly.  On Good Friday (April 14), the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) moved 13 Chinese women to a deportation holding center in Bakersfield, Calif.  Five of these women had fled China after being forced to have abortions.  Others had been forcibly sterilized, or had escaped after being ordered to undergo abortions and/or sterilization.  It appears that their deportation is imminent unless Congress passes H.R. 1561 with the forced-abortion asylum provision intact.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  The anti-immigration lobbyists are stirring up some fears, but the fact that a militantly "pro-choice" Member of Congress (Rep. Patricia Schroeder) is their champion undercuts their ability to appeal to the pro-life majority in the House.  Rep. Schroeder will be hard-pressed to explain why she isn't more sensitive to the fact that Chinese women don't have any "choice" about abortion.  However, President Clinton has threatened to veto H.R. 1561 for other reasons, mainly because it significantly cuts foreign aid.  If the House cannot override the veto, Rep. Smith would have to find another vehicle to enact the forced-abortion asylum policy.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Adopt the $5,000 Adoption Tax Credit </H3>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The $5,000 adoption tax credit is a pro-family measure that would help to reduce some of the financial obstacles associated with adopting a child.  It enjoys strong support in the House, but has weaker support in the Senate. 
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The $5,000 adoption tax credit was a primary component of the House GOP's Contract with America.  The provision -- adapted from Rep. Chris Smith's (R-N.J.) Omnibus Adoption Act, H.R. 1066 -- was passed by the House as part of H.R. 1215, the tax cuts package sponsored by Rep. Bill Archer (R-Tex.) and unveiled before an FRC audience.
<P>
<B> BUDGET RESOLUTIONS</B>:  In order to make the $5,000 adoption tax credit a reality, the provision must be included in the budget for each fiscal year.  The first step in that process is the budget resolution, which serves as a blueprint for the appropriating of funds in the final budget.  The House recently passed an historic budget resolution for fiscal year 1996, sponsored by Rep. John Kasich (R-Ohio).  The resolution balances the budget by the year 2002, and includes the $5,000 adoption tax credit in its proposed tax cuts.
<P>
In contrast, the Senate's budget resolution would balance the budget by 2002 but failed to include the adoption tax credit (or any other tax cuts).  Sen. Phil Gramm's (R-Tex.) tax relief amendment (which included the adoption tax credit) was defeated by a vote of 69-31.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The House and Senate versions of the budget resolutions will now be melded together to produce one budget known as reconciliation.  It remains to be seen whether the $5,000-per-child adoption tax credit will be maintained in the final version.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  This provision would make adoption a more affordable choice for prospective adoptive parents by allowing them to receive a tax credit of up to $5,000 for quali-fied adoption expenses, including adoption fees, court costs, and attorney fees, among others.  This provision is important because it reduces the financial obstacles that might otherwise hinder middle- and low-income families from adopting.  [The average cost of an adoption is between $10,000 and $15,000.]  It is also an important step in encouraging the adoption choice -- a choice which benefits the birth mother, the adopted child, and the adoptive parents.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Much depends upon the reconciliation of the two budget resolution versions.  If the Senate and, most especially, the members of the House-Senate conference committee on the budget can be convinced of the importance of pro-family tax cuts, prospects are good for the passage of the $5,000 adoption tax credit.
<CENTER><H3> Coercive Abortion Training Threatens Accreditation of Hospitals </H3></CENTER>
<P>
On February 14, 1995 the 23-member Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) voted unanimously to pass new regulations mandating that all medical residents specializing in obstetrics and gynecology be trained to perform elective abortions.  Individual residents expressing moral and/or religious objections to abortion would, presumably, be able to opt out of the abortion training, but common sense suggests that they will face strong pressure to undergo the new "standard" training.  Medical schools with a religious affiliation that oppose abortion would not be required to provide abortion training directly, but they would be required to arrange for such training for those students who do not object.  Many religious medical schools currently reject any affiliation whatsoever with abortion providers.  
<P>
Programs which fail to comply with the new regulations risk losing their accreditation.   However, over the last 20 years, the number of medical schools offering elective abortion training to their residents has declined.  In 1976, 92.5 percent of U.S. medical schools offered first-trimester abortion training, either on a routine or optional basis.  In 1991, 68.8 percent of medical schools offered first-trimester abortion training.  About one third of medical schools refuse to provide abortion training due to moral and/or legal reasons. 
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Pete Hoekstra (R-Mich.) plans to offer legislation in June that would reverse this coercive directive.  The legislation would "protect individuals, entities and programs from discrimination on the basis of their refusal to be trained, to train, or to arrange for training in the performance of induced abortion."  Senator Dan Coats (R-Ind.) is prepared to introduce similar legislation in the Senate. 
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The House Economic and Educational Opportunities Oversight and Investigations subcommittee examined this issue during a hearing on June 14.  Witnesses included several medical directors of OB/GYN departments at public universities or hospitals who oppose the new requirement and a representative from ACGME.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Congressional action is necessary to reverse this coercive policy.  Accreditation status qualifies teaching hospitals to receive federal reimbursement (from Medicare and Medicaid) for services which medical residents provide to patients.  Moreover, doctors must ordinarily graduate from accredited training programs to get certified as competent in their specialties.  
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS:  </B> Rep. Hoekstra's legislation may be attached as an amendment to health care legislation, such as the Health Professions Education Consolidation and Reauthorization Act.

</CENTER><P><CENTER><H3> Getting Back to the Basics:  Disestablishing the U.S. Education Department</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Education has been traditionally -- and constitutionally -- a responsibility of states and localities.  But since the U.S. Education Department was founded in 1979, it has followed the iron law of bureaucracies, seeking to expand its range and influence.  Legislation is needed to take educational decisions from the hands of federal bureaucrats and return them to parents, teachers, and communities.
<P>
<B> BILL AND SPONSORS</B>:  On May 24, 1995, the Back to the Basics Education Reform Bill was introduced.  This bill's main sponsors are Joe Scarborough (R-Fla.), Steve Chabot (R-Ohio), 
and John Boehner (R-Ohio).  Members of the House Education Task Force are among the cosponsors.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Within one year of passage, this bill would shut down the U.S. Education Department.  Many programs, including Goals 2000, would be repealed, while general funding for elementary/secondary and higher education would be converted to two block grants for the states.  The only stipulation is that 98 percent of a state's block grant be passed on to the local level.  Authorization for the block grants would last just three years, at which time the bill proposes that a tax cut for families replace the block grants.  A few functions of the Department would be transferred to more appropriate agencies:  Impact Aid to the Department of Defense, Indian Education to the Department of the Interior, Civil Rights to the Department of Justice, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and student loan programs to the Department of Health and Human Services.  The proposal goes beyond talk of shuffling offices and putting a new sign on the door; it takes a serious step towards removing the federal government from our schools.  The proposed tax cut would further reduce the government's influence over education.  Increased revenue for parents would empower them to make more decisions about their children's education.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  President Bill Clinton has already promised the National Education Association (NEA) that he would "remember who put me here."  He will clearly veto legislation that eliminates the NEA's primary representative in the federal government, the Education Department.  However, the executive office cannot authorize expenditures which have not been appropriated by the House.  The House Republican Budget Resolution zeroes out funding for the U.S. Education Department by 2002.  That improves the prospects for the Back to the Basics Education Reform Bill.
<P>


<P>
<CENTER><H3> Getting Back to the Basics:  Repealing Goals 2000</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Ignoring parental pleas for education to get "back to the basics," the 103rd Congress adopted Goals 2000, a program which further centralized education, increased bureau-cracy, and added a host of new non-academic programs.  It was described by supporters as a new pattern for local-state-federal partnership in education.  The debate has now shifted to limiting the federal role in education.  Goals 2000, representing the height of federal intrusiveness into schools, should be the first program to be dismantled.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  On May 10, Rep. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) offered an amendment in 
the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee to repeal Goals 2000.  The committee did not vote on the motion at that time, but Rep. Graham plans to raise the issue again later this year.  That same day, the committee voted in favor of H.R. 1045, a bill to abolish the National Education Standards and Improvement Council (NESIC), which was created by 
Goals 2000.  Opportunities Committee chairman Bill Goodling (R-Penn.) is sponsoring the bill. 
<P>
<B> DATE INTRODUCED</B>:  H.R. 1045 was introduced on February 24, 1995.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The House passed H.R. 1045 soon after the bill was reported out of committee.  Legislation to remove the opportunity-to-learn (OTL) standards from the law may be introduced later this summer.  A bill to repeal the whole law should appear later this year.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  NESIC would have functioned much like a national school board by reviewing and certifying state and national standards.  There is a general consensus that this is an inappropriate function for the federal government.  OTL standards shift the focus of reform back to increasing inputs into education, which requires increased spending.  We know that spending does not drive academic performance.  OTL standards should be removed from the law.  However, the Goals 2000 agenda will carry on as long as block grants to states continue.  Education reform at this historic moment calls for a reduction in the role of the federal government in American schools and a return to the traditional role of school:  teaching students the basics like reading, writing, and arithmetic.  A decisive first step will be the repeal of Goals 2000, which subverts education reform with more federal regulation and spending.     
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  H.R. 1045 should see minimal opposition, but the U.S. Education Department will fight fiercely to maintain its new conduit for imposing policy on the local school:  Goals 2000.  But the department is on the defensive.  Gov. George Allen of Virginia has announced that he will not accept Goals 2000 funding for his state.  Across the nation, parents are outraged by the implentation of Goals 2000 in their local schools.  The U.S. Education Department's new partnership has turned against them:  it is being attacked from all sides -- federal, state, and local.
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Promote Parental Choice in Education </H3>
</CENTER><P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  As evidence of the academic failure of our monopoly public school system mounts, legislation is needed to help parents choose a safe, academically successful public, private, religious or home school for their children. 
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) and Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.) have introduced S. 618, a bill to spend $30 million on 10-20 demonstration projects.  It would allow low-income parents of students in inner-city schools to choose among public, private, and religious schools.  In addition, FRC is considering alternative legislation to grant a tax credit to parents who choose private, religious or home schools or who select a public school different from the one to which their children have been assigned. 
<P>
<B> DATE INTRODUCED</B>:  March 24, 1995 (Coats-Lieberman).
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Coats-Lieberman is in committee. 
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Sens. Coats and Lieberman offered this legislation in the 103rd Congress.  It was narrowly defeated in the Senate last year (52-41).  Their proposal has since gained the interest and support of prominent columnists, such as neoconservative Ben Wattenberg and E.J. Dionne, writer for the liberal Washington Post.  The purpose of the bill is to fund what are called demonstration projects.  Sponsors believe that when poor parents choose schools, the evidence we gain from this experiment will be so positive and so compelling as to clinch the argument for parental choice in education.  Because this bill would benefit low-income, inner-city students, who are disproportionately minority children, its backers believe that the idea will overwhelm the usual liberal case against parental choice.  Advocates of the public school monopoly generally argue that parental choice in education is elitist, that it will "re-segregate" the public schools, that private and religious schools merely "skim off" the best students.  Some pro-family advocates, however, argue that the Coats-Lieberman bill would expand the federal role in education at a time when the goal of dis-establishing the U.S. Education Department is a higher priority.  A better solution at the federal level may be tuition tax credits.  FRC is considering legislation which would allow all parents to retain a portion of their earnings for the purpose of selecting safe, excellent schools for their children.  This legislation would enable parents to select among public, private, religious or home schools.  It would protect the integrity of independent schools since there would be no cash transfer from the government to the schools. 
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Despite arranging for quality private schools for their own children, Bill Clinton and Al Gore will vigorously oppose parental choice legislation which includes non-public schools.  Coats-Lieberman therefore faces a veto threat.  Tuition tax credit legislation would face a gauntlet of liberal opposition and senators who stubbornly regard any family tax relief as a "giveaway,"  but it could benefit by being referred to a more friendly committee.

<CENTER><H3> Adopt the $500 Per-Child Tax Credit</H3>
</CENTER><P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The $500 per-child tax credit is a pro-family measure that would help to relieve some of the tax burden on parents.  It enjoys strong support in the House, but has weaker support in the Senate.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The $500 per-child tax credit was an integral part of the American Dream Restoration Act, the "crown jewel" of the Contract with America, which passed as part of H.R. 1215 (sponsored by Rep. Bill Archer [R-Tex.]).  The credit is non-refundable (meaning that it only reduces taxes; it does not provide cash welfare to those with no tax liability).  This serves to target the bulk of the tax savings to middle-income families in the 15 percent tax bracket.
<P>
The House recently passed its fiscal year 1996 resolution, sponsored by Rep. John Kasich (R-Ohio), to balance the budget by the year 2002, and it includes the $500 per-child credit in its proposed tax cuts.  The Senate's resolution, though it also balances the budget by 2002, included no tax cuts, as Sen. Phil Gramm's (R-Tex.) amendment to add the per-child tax credit to the budget resolution was rejected in the Senate.  It remains to be seen whether or not the $500 per-child tax credit will survive once these budget resolutions are melded into one budget by the two houses.   
<P>
<B> STATUS:  </B> The fate of the $500 per-child tax credit is uncertain.  While Sen. Gramm's amendment to the budget resolution was defeated, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole has indicated that he intends to secure a significant per-child tax credit in the budget resolution conference committee meeting with the House.  In addition, Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) and Sen. Rod Grams (R-Minn.) have pledged to offer amendments on the Senate floor calling for the $500 per-child tax credit if the Senate Finance Committee, headed by Sen. Robert Packwood (R-Oreg.), continues to balk at offering pro-family tax relief.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  FRC has been calling on Congress to adopt pro-family tax relief for many years.  Today, the average family of four contributes 25 cents on every dollar in income taxes and payroll taxes to the U.S. government, compared to 2 cents on every dollar in 1950.  In light of this, the per-child tax credit is designed to help offset the extraordinary erosion in per-child income tax benefits over the last half-century.  Passage of significant pro-child tax relief should be a top priority in the ensuing months of Congress.  
<P>
Streamlining government spending and permitting families to keep more of their own income -- for things like dental appointments and clothing purchases and electric bills -- benefits both the national economy and the personal economy of families.  Immediate pro-family tax relief should be a part of any government plan to balance the budget and make government more efficient.  In the months to come, it will be interesting to see if the Congress as a whole and the Senate in particular heard Americans last November and will give American families the opportunity to keep more of their own money.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  At this point, the fate of the per-child tax credit is uncertain.  However, if the Senate and, most especially, the members of the conference committee on the budget can be convinced of the importance of pro-family tax cuts, prospects are good for passage of the $500 per-child tax credit.

<P>
<CENTER><H3> Broaden IRA Eligibility to Non-Employed Spouses</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  To help alleviate the financial burden on families in which one spouse stays at home.  Legislation to allow expansion of IRA benefits to non-employed spouses would help provide relief for families who choose to have one spouse stay at home and would recognize the important contribution that non-employed spouses make to the income production of employed spouses -- an acknowledgment commonly made in divorce settlements.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The Family Reinvestment Act (H.R. 1040), introduced by Rep. Bill Baker (R-Calif.), allows full-time homemakers and wage-earning spouses a deductible IRA contribution 
of up to $2,500 each; this was passed in the House as part of the Contract with America.  (Furthermore, this legislation permits families to borrow from their IRA for education expenses or to buy a home, with the provision that the funds be paid back to the family with interest.)  Similar legislation, the IRA Equity Bill (S. 287), has been introduced in the Senate by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex) and allows deductible contributions of up to $2,000 by non-employed spouses.  
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  It is important that the Senate pass legislation to help relieve the tax burden on families.  The House bill was passed as part of the Contract with America.  
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Along with the attractive idea of expanding the uses of IRAs to help free-up family finances (e.g., penalty-free withdrawals to cover major housing, education, and health expenses) is the proposal to broaden the eligibility of IRA's to include non-employed spouses.  While broadening the eligibility of IRA's in general would primarily benefit upper-middle- and upper-income taxpayers, a more targeted broadening of the eligibility to non-employed spouses would provide relief primarily to middle-income families with children -- those most in need of pro-family tax relief.  Currently, two-earner couples can claim almost twice the benefits as single-earner couples, penalizing those families who choose to stay home with their children and ignoring the significant contribution the full-time homemaker makes to the income production of the employed spouse.  Passage of legislation to help level the playing field for single-earner families is a key step to providing relief to American families.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  The battle for IRA benefits for non-employed spouses must be won in the Senate, as pro-family House legislation has been passed already.  It is crucial that the Senate give priority to measures that promote pro-family tax relief. 
Support Medical Savings Accounts
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  In the ongoing effort to reform health care, it is important to support any positive measures which would make health care more cost-effective for families.  Medical savings accounts, or Medical IRAs, are one such measure.  Making the option of medical savings accounts available to employees and unemployed individuals would encourage more prudent use of health care dollars and promote greater family autonomy in health care decisions.
<P>
<B> BILL AND SPONSORS</B>:  Reps. Bill Archer (R-Tex.) and Andrew Jacobs (D-Ind.) have formulated legislation promoting medical savings accounts.  The proposal would amend the existing tax laws to create cost-effective incentives for employers to offer, and for employees to choose, medical savings accounts.  Rep. Archer expects to introduce his bill in mid-June and has said that many of his colleagues in the House have expressed great interest in cosponsoring such legislation.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The bill is currently being "scored" by the Congressional Budget Office to see what impact, if any, the reform will have on the overall budget, e.g., whether it is budget-neutral,  whether it will save money, or whether it will require the allocation of additional federal funds.  
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Medical savings accounts (MSAs) are similar to individual retirement accounts (IRAs) in that pre-tax dollars up to a certain limit may be set aside for lower-level medical expenses to be controlled by and used by families.  MSAs usually supplement catastrophic health insurance coverage, helping to cover medical expenses before the insurance deductible is reached.  Because individuals are directly responsible for the use of their health care dollars, MSAs guard against the overutilization of health care services, thereby helping to curb skyrocketing health care costs.  Moreover, individuals reap the rewards of managing their health care dollars wisely and of practicing good habits, for any monies not spent by the end of the year may be kept by the individual as taxable income, or kept in the account for future health care needs.
<P>
MSAs also promote greater autonomy in health care choices.  Because MSA funds may be used toward any medical expenses, including those not expressly covered within the insurance deductible, an individual has more flexibility to choose health services and providers and more portability of coverage (i.e., ability to keep coverage even when changing jobs).
<P>
Furthermore, evidence indicates that MSAs work well.  Golden Rule Insurance company recently conducted a survey of their employees who are covered under MSA plans.  The results show that (1) MSA enrollees saved money and reduced overall health care spending, and that (2) MSA enrollees were highly satisfied with their plan -- fully 88 percent prefer the MSA plan to other health insurance plans they had in the past.
<P> 
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  The idea of MSAs is not new; therefore, many members of Congress are already familiar with and support the concept.  MSAs should have a good chance of passage in the 104th Congress, especially considering the fact that MSAs were a key component in many Republicans' health care reform proposals last year.

<CENTER><H3> Implement the Gay Ban</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Most Americans thought the military homosexual issue was resolved with the passage of a law.  Wrong.  The Clinton Administration ignored the law when it wrote the implementing policies and lifted the ban anyway.  Now, the Administration is using the courts to get around public opinion and scuttle the ban by building a case that will lose in the Supreme Court.  That's why new legislation is imperative.
<P>
Pentagon and Justice Department officials have told FRC that what we thought was an exclusion policy is really an accommodation policy which permits homosexuals to serve.   So far, Congress has ignored this swindle by failing to exercise its constitutional responsibility to enforce military regulations.
<P>
The Pentagon policy that took effect February 28, 1994 differs in several ways from the law it purportedly implements:
<P>
<UL><LI>The law carries the statement, "homosexuality is incompatible with military service."  The Clinton regulations omit it. 
<P>
<LI>The law forbids service by homosexuals.  The Clinton regulations permit service by homosexuals.  At least 15 avowed homosexuals are now serving openly.
<P>
<LI>The law relies on commander discretion to initiate investigations.  But the Clinton regulations create a "criminal-like" standard.  According to Secretary of Defense William Perry, if soldiers attend gay pride parades, frequent gay bars, and possess gay materials, this does not constitute "credible" evidence to initiate an inquiry.
<P>
<LI>Contrary to 200 years of military experience and practice, Clinton's Defense Department no longer acknowledges homosexual behavior as a marker for increased security risk.  Information discovered during a security investigation cannot be used without high-level political permission.
<P>
<LI>Although the law permits asking about homosexual acts and orientation at the point of admission and whenever appropriate, the Clinton Administration refuses to do so.</UL>
<P>
In the first court test of the new law, the Clinton Justice Department failed to use key arguments and called no witnesses.  
<P>
On March 30, 1995, Judge Eugene Nickerson of the Eastern District of New York ignored volumes of case law precedents and struck down the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy.  The case is<I> Lieutenant Colonel Jane Able, et al. v. United States of America</I>.
<P>
The Justice Department did not bother to:
<P>
<UL><LI>Dispute biased research and testimony by "expert" pro-homosexual witnesses.
<P>
<LI>Present well-documented physical and psychological problems with homosexuality.
<P>
<LI>Show that homosexual "lifestyles" and "values" jeopardize morale and unit cohesion.
</UL><P>
FRC's Military Readiness Project (MRP), with senior advisors former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Thomas M. Moorer and former Marine Corps Commandant Robert H. Barrow, is lobbying Congress to amend the 1996 Defense Authorization Act.  Should the <I> Able </I>case be heard by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals before the law is changed, irreparable damage may be done.
<P>
FRC's MRP wants the following changes included in the 1996 Act:
<P>
<UL> <LI>Require the Secretary of Defense to ask all potential recruits whether they are a homosexual or have engaged or intend to engage in homosexual acts.
<P>
<LI>Require the Secretary of Defense to revoke current policy and issue regulations consistent with the law.
</UL><P>
TheDefense Authorization Act will come to a final vote in early August.  Some members want to avoid another debate over homosexuals in the military and will try to torpedo any amend-ments.  However, without legislation the courts will have the final say on an issue which  constitutionally belongs to the Congress.  And the Clinton Administration will continue to keep more homosexuals in the military, thus undermining combat readiness, legal defense of the ban, and the moral fabric of the nation.  The stakes are extremely high.  If the military falls, federal power will be used to validate the rest of the homosexual agenda, including gay "marriage" and adoption of children.
<P>
Senators Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) and Dan Coats (R-Ind.) have both expressed concern and may take legislative action.

<CENTER><H3> Cable Porn</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Some cable TV operators include channels featuring pornographic material in their basic cable subscriptions.  This increases access to pornography, particularly by young people.    
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Tony Hall (D-Ohio) and Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) introduced the Family Viewing Cable Television Act of 1995 (H.R. 1540) on May 2, 1995.  The bill forbids cable operators from including pornography in basic cable packages.  
<P>
<B> STATUS:  </B> H.R. 1540 is currently pending before the House Judiciary Committee but no hearings have been scheduled.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Currently, many consumers are forced to accept channels featuring pornography as part of their basic cable package.  This makes it more difficult for them to protect their children.  The bill would secure the right of parents to keep their television safe for family viewing.  It would not outlaw pornographic material on cable television.  Rather, the bill would merely prohibit operators from automatically including it in basic cable packages.  Consumers wishing to have pornographic channels on their cable systems would be free to do so, but they would simply have to request them from their cable company.  
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  The bill is facing opposition from industry lobbyists and advocates of unrestricted free speech.  Supporters may offer it as an amendment to another bill if hearings are not scheduled soon.
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Promote Porn-Free Technology</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The growth of technology has created many exciting opportunities.  Unfortunately, it is also being used to expand access to pornography.  Many on-line computer networks such as the Internet operate largely unregulated and are a virtual no-man's land where material is exchanged without regard to laws on obscenity and indecency.  Legislation is needed to bring computer networks into compliance with obscenity and pornography laws.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The Communications Decency Act of 1995 (S. 314) introduced by Sen. Jim Exon (D-Neb.)  
<P>
<B> DATE INTRODUCED</B>:  February 1, 1995.
<P>
<B> STATUS:  </B> The bill has been incorporated as an amendment to the Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995 (S. 652).  The telecommunications bill has been reported out of committee and is awaiting floor action. 
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The Communications Decency Act amends current dial-a-porn laws regulating obscenity and indecency to include computer technology.  Without questioning Sen. Exon's intentions, many pro-family groups, including the Family Research Council, fear that the bill in its present form might actually create more problems than it solves.  Computer industry lobbyists have hit Sen. Exon hard, resulting in significant weakening of S. 314 since February.  FRC and other groups are working with Sen. Exon and other senators to develop a strong law that incorporates the original goals of  S. 314.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  FRC will continue to work with Sen. Exon to try to restore S. 314.  Meanwhile, several alternative proposals are in the works.  Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) intends to add an amendment to the telecommunications bill which would instruct Attorney General Janet Reno to "study" the problem of computer porn.  Sen. Leahy's approach is a do-nothing approach which pro-family groups will oppose.  If Sen. Exon's bill does not improve, parents might see help from Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) or Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) who are working on solutions that are more in line with pro-family concerns.

<CENTER><H3> Military Profits from Pornography</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Military exchange managers are responsible to select magazines based on sales volume, customer preferences, and, in the case of pornographic material, whether it fits the definition for "obscenity" outlined in the 1973 Supreme Court case of Miller v. California.  At present, the services oppose removing so-called "soft" pornography from exchange shelves because of  the perceived threat of legal action from the American Civil Liberties Union.  
<P>
Obscenity was legally defined by the Supreme Court in the Miller v. California decision.  According to this ruling, something is obscene and therefore unprotected by the First Amendment when it satisfies the following criteria:
<P>
<UL> <LI>Taken as a whole, appeals to a prurient interest in sex.
<P>
<LI>Depicts sexual conduct in a patently offensive manner.
<P>
<LI>Taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value.
</UL><P>
These criteria were written to protect freedom of speech and expression.  But there are kinds of speech and expression not protected by the Constitution: slander, libel, perjury, false advertising, conspiracy, yelling "fire" in a crowded theater, copyright violations and child pornography.  The military has determined that certain "soft" pornographic material is protected (not obscene) and should be sold to uniformed patrons in government stores.
<P>
Pornography is sexually explicit material intended to arouse the consumer.  It is addictive and very often leads men to sexual crime.  This fact should persuade military leaders to judge wisely between two competing outcomes: the damage attributable to addictive pornographic material versus an ACLU lawsuit.  For now, the government is more fearful of an ACLU lawsuit.  
<P>
The government has much experience selling addictive merchandise to military patrons.  For example, it has sold alcohol, a potentially addictive substance, to servicemembers for most of the military's 200-year history.  Admittedly, most alcohol users avoid addiction, but enough do become addicts and they cost the services dearly -- productivity losses, personal injury, judicial expenses and property damage.
<P>
Pornographic material is much like alcohol; it is a very powerful stimulant.  The consumer begins with limited exposure -- "soft" pornography sold in military stores.  In some cases a  desire for sexually explicit material grows to require more explicit, more deviant images for the consumer to reach a previous level of sexual stimulation.  Gradually the addict is desensitized to the more explicit material.  Finally, he may act out sexually his pornographic fantasies prompted by the material.  These activities may include compulsive promiscuity, exhibitionism, group sex, voyeurism, having sex with children, rape, or sadism.
<P>
Serial killer Ted Bundy stated just before his execution for the sexual assault and murder of many women, "You are going to kill me, and that will protect society from me.  But out there are many, many more people who are addicted to pornography, and you are doing nothing about that."  Bundy blames his addiction to pornography for his mental state that led to his murdering as many as 31 women.
<P>
No pending legislation mandates the removal of pornographic materials from military exchange shelves, but President Clinton has the unilateral authority to do so.  Military consumers can purchase the material without the government's help.

<CENTER><H3> Combat Illegitimacy in Welfare Policy</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE:  </B> The current welfare system promotes family breakdown by guaranteeing a right to cash benefits even if one engages in irresponsible conduct.  Moreover, the bureaucratic arrangements that spring up to administer those benefits supplant voluntary organizations that offer real help -- the kind of help that changes lives.  Any legislation that attempts to reform welfare must end the entitlement status of numerous welfare programs, including AFDC cash benefits, and afford states the maximum flexibility to experiment with anti-poverty efforts that impose behavioral requirements (charitable alternatives, in particular).
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  House bill, H.R. 4, "The Personal Responsibility Act."  Senate floor action is expected.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  In March, the House passed The Personal Responsibility Act as part of its Contract with America.  The welfare reform bill will reach the Senate floor later this summer.  While the Senate Finance Committee did vote to eliminate the federal guarantee of cash assistance in favor of a strategy that "block grants" money to the states, the committee bill fails to ensure that illegitimacy remains a prominent focus of the debate on the floor.  The House bill, H.R. 4, included three essential provisions to strengthen families:  a prohibition on cash payments to mothers under age 18 who bear children out of wedlock; a freeze on benefits for mothers who bear additional children while on welfare; and incentive bonus payments to states that reduce illegitimacy rates -- without increasing the number of abortions.  While the Senate bill does not include any of the essential provisions that were incorporated in the House bill, at least four senators have indicated that they will fight to restore the focus on family breakdown.  Family groups expect either Senator Bob Dole (R-Kans.) or Senator Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) to lead the  initiative.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Given the consequences for the individual child, the surrounding community, and the national polity, bringing a baby into this world without a sense of sacred responsibility cannot be regarded as a morally neutral act.  Congress should now recognize that it is also wrong to promote such activity by subsidizing it.
<P>
"The task," Charles Murray concludes, is to "neutralize whatever is impeding the age-old impulse of human beings to form families. . . .  A major change in the behavior of young women and the adults in their lives will occur only when the prospect of having a child out of wedlock is once again so immediately, tangibly punishing that it overrides everything else."  Eliminating grants to unwed teenage mothers will be necessary, though not sufficient, to restore the integrity of the family unit.  
<P>
Frances Perkins, chief architect of Franklin Roosevelt's welfare policy, opposed extending federal entitlements to unmarried mothers because she foresaw that subsidizing illegitimacy would escalate family breakdown.  It would be ironic at best if the current majority in Congress were to find themselves to the left of the most liberal member of the Roosevelt Administration, because they rejected that intuition, now confirmed by years of sad experience.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  While Congress is almost certain to pass a welfare bill this session, the fate of the illegitimacy provisions is uncertain.

<P>
<CENTER><H3> Zero Out Title X</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Title X of the Public Health Service Act was enacted in 1970 as a grant program to fund family planning projects throughout the country.  The program helped to spawn the proliferation of family planning clinics within states, granting federal sanction to the distribution of contraception to unmarried women and to minors without parental consent.  Having received over $193 million from taxpayers last year, funding for this unauthorized and failed program should be eliminated altogether.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Title X of the Public Health Service Act receives its funding through the Labor/HHS Appropriations bill which comes before Congress for a vote every year.  Neither the House nor Senate budget resolutions included a proposal to zero out Title X funding.  However, House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Tex.) has promised to bring an amendment to the House floor to defund Title X if funding is not eliminated in committee.  Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) and his state's Congressional colleagues, Reps. Ernest Istook and Steve Largent, are also working to zero out Title X funding.
<P>
<B> STATUS:  </B> Efforts to defund Title X are in progress. The Labor/HHS Appropriations bill will be considered by Congress this summer.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The reasons to defund Title X are numerous.  First of all, Title X should not continue to receive funding because it is an unauthorized program.  Its authorization expired in 1985.  Secondly, Title X is duplicative.  Several other programs such as Medicaid and the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant provide family planning to low-income and other targeted populations.  There is no clear basis for the federal government to run a categorical family planning program when state governments have the capability to set health care priorities within the parameters of an alternative block grant.  Finally and most importantly, Title X is a failed program.  Since the inception of Title X, out-of-wedlock births, abortions, and sexually-transmitted diseases have all risen dramatically, especially in the populations Title X is supposed to have targeted.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Expect a huge fight pitting pro-abortion, pro-contraception groups intent on saving Title X against pro-family, pro-life groups working to defund the program.  Because Planned Parenthood receives a good portion of Title X monies, expect them to launch a campaign to save the program.  Outcome of a floor fight is uncertain.
<P>
Another approach, which may or may not prevent a floor battle, could be far more effective.  Overall grant reform may eliminate Title X funding without targeting any specific program.  For example, Congress could pass a law saying that no funds shall be appropriated to any program unless that program is currently authorized.  This is a justifiable reform in light of the efforts to balance the budget and the recently passed law eliminating unfunded federal mandates to states.  Thus, Title X funding might be eliminated on the basis of its unauthorized status.  However, if such grant reform passes, it is probable that pro-abortion members of Congress may try to bring Title X up for reauthorization.  Prospects to successfully reauthorize Title X are slim.  However, without such grant reform, funds could still be appropriated to unauthorized programs.
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Derail the AIDS Gravy Train</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The federal government, all told, is spending $7.1 billion on AIDS through several government agencies in fiscal 1995.  The Public Health Service alone spends about $2.9 billion yearly ($91,355 per AIDS death contrasted with $1,060 for every cancer death).  Other federal expenditures come from HUD, Social Security, Veterans Affairs, and the Agency for International Development.  Legislation is needed to bring AIDS spending in line with money spent on other terminal diseases such as cancer.  And AIDS funds should not go toward the promotion of homosexuality in the guise of  "AIDS education."  Time-tested epidemiological responses such as early diagnosis and partner tracing should be employed.
 <P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Congress seems prepared to take a business-as-usual approach to AIDS.  On April 3, Sen. Nancy Kassebaum's (R-Kans.) Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act (S. 641) provides $4.3 billion over the next five years, beginning in fiscal 1996, and allows for "such sums as may be necessary," a budget-busting possibility.  Other sponsors include Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kans.).  A House version was introduced by Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) on January 4, 1995.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The Senate bill was passed out of the Labor and Human Resources Committee.  Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) has put a legislative hold on the bill.  No hearings have been scheduled.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Much AIDS money goes to legitimate activities, such as HIV research and care for AIDS victims.  A significant amount, however, goes to politically active groups that promote the radical homosexual agenda.  Congress needs to hold hearings to examine how the money has been used so far.  All funding to groups that promote homosexuality should be cut, leaving more money for groups that deal with AIDS in a medically responsible fashion.  Current AIDS education funding should be terminated, since the money is going toward promotion of condoms and the myth of  "safe sex" instead of documentably successful abstinence education.  And spending formulas should be changed:
<P><OL> 
<LI>Only those infected with HIV or AIDS who need care should receive benefits.  Formulas based on "AIDS prevalence" distort funding needs, because they count the dead along with the living.  More of the money should go to under-served minority communities.
<P>
<LI>People with HIV or AIDS should qualify where they currently live, not where they were diagnosed.  Someone might be diagnosed in a large city but return home elsewhere for care.
<P>
<LI>Means testing for AIDS dollars should be introduced.  Those with adequate insurance should not be in the same pool with those who truly have no other means of payment.</OL>
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Fifty-five senators have signed on as sponsors, but hearings could result in positive changes.  Sen. Dole's role is pivotal if the bill's abuses are to be addressed.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Defund Federal Promotion of Homosexuality</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The Clinton Administration mandated AIDS/Awareness Training for all Federal employees.  Some of this training is used to promote homosexuality.  Legislation is needed to defund this training.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS: </B>  S. 25 -- To stop the waste of taxpayer funds on activities by government agencies to encourage their employees or officials to accept homosexuality as a legitimate or normal lifestyle.  Sponsor: Senator Jesse A. Helms (R-N.C.)
<P>
H.R. 862 -- To prohibit the use of Federal funds to promote homosexuality.  Sponsor: Represent-ative Robert K. Dornan (R-Calif.)
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  H.R. 862 -- was introduced February 8, 1995, and was assigned to the Subcommittee for Human Resources and Intergovernmental Affairs of the Government Reform and Oversight Committee. 
<P>
S. 25 --  was introduced January 4, 1995, but is unlikely to be voted on until late summer or 
early fall.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Congressman Dornan's strategy is to amend all appropriations bills to include this language.  H.R. 862 will not likely be passed as a stand-alone bill, and thus, the Senate strategy is likely to be similar.
<P>
<B> OVERVIEW</B>:  President Clinton directed all federal departments to provide HIV/AIDS training.   According to many federal employees, the mandatory training promotes homosexuality and includes unnecessarily graphic explanations.  A Defense Department worker complained that her training included a slide show of  "sex toys" and flavored condoms.  Other workers were lectured that their grandmothers probably had engaged in sodomy as a form of birth control.
<P>
Two supervisors and 41 employees in the Federal Communication Commission's audio services division chose not to attend mandatory "AIDS Awareness Training."  An FCC employee stated, "The classes are basically an adult version of high school sex ed., with the modern-day sensitivity training thrown in."
<P>
Department of Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary created "Walkin' the Talk" AIDS training materials for three-hour, mandatory training sessions.  A memo from the Department's Federal Workplace HIV/AIDS Education Coordinator states, "All employees are required to complete this training."
<P>
The training includes a brief history of HIV and a discussion of symptoms, prevention, and risk reduction.  There also is a discussion of needle-sharing and sexual contact.  Federal employees are told to reduce their HIV contraction risk by practicing "safer sex" by using barriers like condoms, dental dams, plastic wrap, and latex gloves.  The manual states, "A dental dam 
(a small, square piece of latex) or plastic wrap may be used for any oral-vaginal or oral-anal contact.  All types of barriers (condoms, dental dams, and plastic wrap) are effective against HIV transmission only if they are used correctly and consistently from start to finish."
<P>
The Energy Department makes a disclaimer: "HIV is transmitted without regard to gender, age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, or identification with any group.  For this reason, we avoid referring to high risk groups."  Not identifying "high risk groups" is irresponsible.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report shows that at least 87 percent of AIDS victims either contracted the virus from homosexual encounters or by sharing needles.
<P>
Probably the most outrageous example of government-sponsored AIDS training was done for the Forest Service.  It took place in the Forest Service's Tahoe Region on May 6, 1994 and was conducted by a local health official with degrees in sexology, a self-described homosexual phlebotomist (individual who draws blood), and an HIV-positive woman from the community.
<P>
The phlebotomist was an ex-convict who tried to debunk "homophobic" misconceptions.  He speculated that many husbands were involved in homosexual affairs.  He showed a variety of condoms and how to apply them to a life-size replica of erect male genitalia.  He even explained a technique for using one's mouth to apply the condom.  He also explained the proper cleaning techniques when sharing hypodermic needles.
<P>
The Forest Service also has a training booklet entitled, "Valuing Diversity."  Inside the booklet are statements such as: "Fact: Psychological and social influences alone cannot cause homosexuality....Fact: A biological (genetic, hormonal, neurological, other) predisposition toward homosexual, bisexual, or heterosexual orientation is present at birth in all boys and girls."  No source for these "facts" is provided, nor could there be.  So-called genetic studies on homosexuality are flawed and typically conducted by homosexual activists.
<P>
AIDS/HIV awareness training and diversity training have become vehicles for promoting homosexuality in the federal government.

<CENTER><H3> Restore Combat Exemptions for Women</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Clinton administration has removed 250,000 combat exemptions for women.  Women can now be assigned to more than 80 percent of all military positions -- many combat-related.  Meanwhile, Congress has failed to host hearings to examine the recommendations of the 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces, which opposed many of the recent changes.  The Administration, with Congressional neglect, has advanced a feminist agenda without regard for readiness. 
<P>
Secretary of Defense William Perry promises, "Our over-arching goal is to maintain a high-quality, ready and effective force.  By increasing the numbers of units and positions to which women can be assigned, the military services gain greater flexibility in the development and use of human resources."
<P>
The Clinton Administration has not explained how liberalization of the female assignment policy will accomplish the goal of maintaining "a high-quality, ready and effective force."  According to Mr. Perry, these changes are intended to expand "the opportunities for women in the military."
<P>
The Administration's decisions to end more exemptions for women have no justification in military necessity and will hurt readiness:
<P><UL>
<LI>There is a sufficient number of male recruits, especially now that the military is downsizing.  
<P>
<LI>No new scientific studies refute the findings of the 1992 Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces, which recommended that "military readiness should be the driving concern regarding assignment policies."
<P>
<LI>The American people still support a go-slow approach to expanding military roles for women.
<P>
<LI>America's likely adversaries still assign only men to their militaries because they know that national security interests cannot be sacrificed to social experimentation.</UL>
<P>
On October 6, 1994,  Representative Ike Skelton (D-Missouri) of the House Armed Service Committee's Subcommittee on Military Forces and Personnel hosted the only hearing since 1991 to consider assignment policies for women.  Although Mr. Skelton began the hearing by stating, "Women should not serve in direct ground combat," and, "I'm of the opinion that second place does not count on the battlefield," he limited the two-hour hearing to one three-member panel which supported the Administration's changes.  Rep. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) had asked to hear dissenting views from a panel of commissioners from the 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces.  His request was denied.
<P>
Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution gives the Congress the responsibility to "raise and support armies" and to "provide and maintain a navy."  Congress also must make the rules and regulations that govern the military, and that includes the number of women in the military and their assignments.
<P>
The 104th Congress should conduct a thorough review of Pentagon policies and seek to reverse the Clinton administration's current course.  No hearings or bills are pending.
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Off The Dole: No Taxpayer Support for Special Interests</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  In Washington, DC some of the most intensive lobbying is done by recipients of taxpayers' money.  Using the funds received from awards, grants and contracts, these government-created special interests lobby Congress for continued, and often increased, taxpayer support.  Moreover, many of the programs created are hostile to the values of the citizens whose money is used to fund them.
<P>
<B> BILL AND SPONSORS</B>:  On March 3, 1995, Rep. Robert Dornan (R-Calif.) introduced the Integrity in Government Act (H.R. 1130), which would prohibit recipients of taxpayer money from lobbying for continuation of their funding.  The bill is currently cosponsored by Rep. Ernest Istook (R-Okla.) and Rep. Mel Hancock (R-Missouri).  
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The Integrity in Government Act is currently before the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The bill is designed to keep taxpayer money out of lobbyists' hands.  It is carefully worded so that it applies only to lobbying for continued support of various programs and agencies.  It does not apply to recipients of entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare.   Nothing in the legislation restricts or interferes with individual citizens' ability to communicate with their elected representatives.  
<P>
The Integrity in Government Act does not have many friends among the special interest groups that are so prevalent in Washington.  Many Members of Congress do not want to support the bill for fear of the money and power of these groups or because they like the idea of taxpayer money being used to lobby Congress for causes they favor.  
 <P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Although no hearings have been scheduled for the bill, supporters say they want to move forward with plans to attach similar legislation to each appropriation and authorization bill that comes up in Congress.  It is believed that attaching such an amendment to each appropriation and authorization will make it more difficult for special interests to oppose efforts at reform.
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Stem the Resurgence of Drug Abuse</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Drug abuse among teenagers has increased significantly in recent years.  This change is attributable to the culture's pro-drug influence, less-than-effective prevention programs, and President Clinton's silence on the issue.  The Administration's national drug strategy focuses on "harm reduction" --  treatment for chronic drug users and less enforcement.  Meanwhile, Congress may cut drug prevention programs.  Any long-term solution requires parental involvement, community programs, and strong national leadership. 
<P>
A nationwide survey by the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) in 1994 found that annual marijuana use among 8th graders rose from 6.2 percent in 1991 to 13 percent in 1994.  The trend is also evident among 10th (16.5 percent to 30.4 percent) and 12th (36.7 percent to 38.2 percent) graders.  And cocaine, crack, heroin, and LSD use among teenagers is also rising and may soon rival the high rates of the 1970s.
<P>
The largest rise is in marijuana abuse, possibly because it is perceived differently from the "hard" drugs.  Although some young people don't even consider marijuana a "drug,"  Dr. Carlton Turner, former NIDA director and head of the Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi, warns, "There is no other drug used or abused by man that has the staying power and broad cellular actions on the body that cannabis [marijuana] does."
<P>
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala states, "Young people must understand that there is clear scientific evidence that marijuana is a dangerous drug that can have acute and hazardous effects."  Over 10,500 published scientific papers show that marijuana damages brain cells, the lungs, may adversely affect reproduction in women and fertility in men, endangers the unborn baby and newborns of pot-smoking women, and could damage the heart.
<P>
Shalala calls for "strong and comprehensive solutions....Young people must grow up knowing unambiguously that drug use -- including smoking marijuana -- is unwise, unhealthful, illegal and wrong.  They must hear this from everyone in their communities -- their parents, their teachers, their employers, their peers, the media -- all of us.  We need anti-drug messages that are every bit as pervasive and strong as the pop culture images that tell our youth drugs are o.k."
<P>
These strong words are not echoed by other Administration officials.  President Clinton has been virtually silent on the topic.  And his national drug strategy focuses on a new philosophy entitled "harm reduction," which provides and supports programs to reduce the danger of drug use-related risks, like HIV infection.  Needle exchange is a key component.  The strategy is geared at changing but not eliminating drug-using behavior, in order to reduce the threat of disease due to drug use.
<P>
Meanwhile, the Administration has cut drug interdiction efforts and increased efforts to treat chronic abusers.  The hope is that having more abusers in treatment will reduce demand -- a step toward ending the plague.
<P>
Unfortunately, the pop culture glamorizes drugs, and there are few alternative cultural icons warning teenagers to "just say no."  Additionally, there is no sign that drug production and distribution are declining.  In fact, there continues to be an ample supply.
<P>
The 104th Congress may cut school-based drug prevention programs believing they don't work.  There are some ineffective programs, but others have good track records and should be kept.  
<P>
The House rescissions bill (H.R. 1158) cut most of the FY 95 drug prevention money.  Pending legislation in the Senate may recover some of the funds.   
<P>
The national drug crisis requires committed parents and community leaders to join forces.  At the national level, leadership such as that provided by President and Mrs. Ronald Reagan is needed to curb the drug glamorization messages and boost effective prevention programs.
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Free Public Broadcasting</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The Corporation for Public Broadcasting was created in 1967 during Lyndon Johnson's "Great Society" to meet a perceived need for taxpayer-financed alternative programming not provided by commercial networks.  Congressional authorization for CPB is due to expire at the end of 1996.  The 104th Congress should let authorization expire and decline to appropriate any more taxpayer money for CPB.  Instead of giving more taxpayer support to CPB, Congress should let it thrive on its own, as it has shown it can do.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The House budget resolution (H. Con. Res. 67) sponsored by Rep. John Kasich (R-Ohio) takes the first steps by providing a three-year phase out of funding for CPB.  The resolution passed the House on May 18 by a vote of 238 to 193.  A weaker Senate budget resolution (S. Con. Res. 13) was passed on May 25 by a vote of 57 to 42.  It includes a provision sponsored by Sen. Hank Brown (R-Col.) to bring commercial sponsors to CPB in order to offset possible reductions in taxpayer subsidies.  The Senate resolution includes no explicit cuts in funding and falls short of the goal of privatization.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Budget resolutions in both houses of Congress provide a starting point for privatizing CPB, but more action is needed.  Budget resolutions are only suggestions for how to spend taxpayers' money.  Bills dealing with the appropriation of CPB funds will be making their way through the Congress this summer.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The CPB should be privatized for several reasons.  First, the federal government should not be in the broadcasting business.  The basis for CPB's existence is the assumption that for good television programming to exist, the government must provide it.  This $285.6 million a year, anti-free market philosophy insults the intelligence of the viewing/listening public because it assumes that they won't support good programming.
<P>
Second, CPB has been a regular launching pad for attacks on the family.  Independent Television Service's Television Families, Dottie Gets Spanked, and Terminal USA ridicule traditional families and glorify non-traditional households.  A PBS documentary What Kids Want to Know About Sex and Growing Up contains graphic sexual information, aimed at children as young as 8 years old.  The role of parents in the education of their children as well as the moral and familial ramifications of sexuality are almost invisible.  PBS's Tales of the City and Tongues Untied are offensive and graphic promotions of the homosexual lifestyle.  Both programs contain gratuitous nudity, lewdness and foul language.  Religious bigotry is also common in CPB programming. National Public Radio's The Politics of Bigotry was billed as an "in-depth investigation of the Christian Right."  It was actually an ugly smear of Christians which violated the First Amendment's guarantee of free exercise of religion.
<P>
Finally, in a time of massive federal deficits, it makes no sense to require taxpayers to shell out their hard-earned dollars so that the government can run a television network that could survive on its own anyway.  As any family knows, serious budget cutting must start with non-essentials. 
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Defunding CPB is a priority for conservatives.  But these efforts are being met with stiff opposition from CPB supporters in both parties who argue that opponents are trying to kill "Big Bird."  It is hoped that the merits of privatization will drown out such scare tactics.

<P>
<CENTER><H3> Free the Arts and Humanities: Defund the NEA and NEH</H3></CENTER>
<P>

<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Over the years, a total of more than $5 billion in taxpayer money has gone toward the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.  These federal agencies disburse millions of dollars each year in grants to institutions and individuals, most of which are not controversial.  But continued revelations of wasteful spending, public sponsorship of blatantly anti-family, anti-Christian, anti-business, pro-feminist and pro-homosexual "scholarly" projects and "art works" may finally motivate Congress to defund the endowments. 
  <P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The House Budget Resolution (H. Con.Res. 67), which passed 238 to 193 on May 18, provides no funds to either of the endowments.  A separate reauthorization bill, however, sponsored by Rep. Bill Goodling (R-Penn.), passed the Education and Economic Opportunities Committee on May 10.  That bill would phase out NEA and NEH by 1999 and is awaiting floor action.  In the Senate, the budget resolution sponsored by Sen. Pete Domenici (R-Ariz.) would cut the endowments but not phase them out.  Senators Jeffords, Kassebaum, Kennedy, et al. have introduced S. 856, the Arts, Humanities, and Museum Services Act of 1995.  This bill would reauthorize both endowments.  Introduced on May 25, it was referred to the Labor and Human Resources Committee.  
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Most legislation on the NEA and NEH seeks to trim funding.  But merely reducing the budgets for the endowments would be breaking faith with American voters who want government to cut back on non-essentials now.  And leaving the endowments bleeding but still very much alive guarantees several years of shrill politicking by subsidy-seeking arts and campus groups.  It also ensures an easier renewal of spending if Congress falls back into 
liberal hands.
<P>
The NEA is budgeted $162.5 million in fiscal 1995 (down $4.5 million from $167 million because of an earlier rescission bill).  NEH is budgeted $172 million (also trimmed by $5 million from $177 million).  The House bill would also place a 5 percent cap on administrative expenses, thus gutting the Washington operations of the endowments, and send 80 percent of the grant money to the state arts councils in block grants.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  An attempt to zero out funds for NEA and NEH failed in the House Education and Economic Opportunities Committee, which settled for the phase-out.  But the House Budget Resolution calls for no funding.  House negotiators will have to choose whether to do the right thing (zero out the agencies) or succumb to pressure from liberal colleagues and the more liberal Senate to retain the agencies in some fashion.  The latter course will earn budget cutters no love from the arts and humanities crowd, and will only ensure more conflict in the years ahead.   
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Religious Rights Restored</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Although the First Amendment to the United States Constitution includes the right to freely exercise religion, the ultra-broad interpretation of the provision prohibiting government from establishing a religion has nearly nullified the free exercise right.  A restorative amendment is needed to return to citizens their full First Amendment rights.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Ernest Istook (R-Okla.) is heading a coalition of congressmen and pro-family groups in drafting an amendment to the U.S. Constitution which would restore to individuals and groups the right to speak and express their religious beliefs.  Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) and Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.) may cosponsor the amendment.  
<P>
<B> DATE INTRODUCED</B>:  The amendment has not yet been introduced.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Before any proposed language is introduced, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution will hold hearings around the country on the topic of  "Religious Liberties and the Bill of Rights."  The first hearing was scheduled to take place in Washington, DC on June 8, 1995, followed by hearings in Harrisonburg, Va., Oklahoma City, Los Angeles, Tampa Bay, New York City, and Philadelphia.
  <P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The starting point for this legislation was H. J. Res. 424, introduced October 7, 1993, which contained the language discussed in the Senate during the Reagan Administration.  The premises upon which this effort is based include the following:  that a constitutional amendment approach is necessary due to existing court decisions on constitutional grounds; that participation in prayer should not be compelled; and that neither a moment of silence nor government-mandated language is acceptable.  While the language of the amendment is not yet final, it is expected to include provisions preventing the government from prohibiting prayer or other religious expression where non-religious expression is permitted, and from discriminating against or denying benefits to groups on account of their religious identity or ideas.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  This amendment will see heavy opposition from the ACLU and like-minded groups.  It is unclear whether the "super-majority" (two-thirds) needed for the amendment to pass is possible. 
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Parental Rights Restored</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Increasingly, parents' efforts to teach their children morals, values, and discipline are frustrated by government bureaucrats who claim a superior role in the development of the child.  A law is needed to restore to parents the right to direct the upbringing of their minor children without governmental interference.

<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) and Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) are each drafting legislation to prohibit the government from interfering with the right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children. 
<P>
<B> DATE INTRODUCED</B>:  The bills have not yet been introduced.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:   Both bills are on hold while the Family Research Council and other pro-family groups hammer out appropriate language.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The Parental Rights Act is designed primarily as a response to parents' inability to control important aspects of their children's education.  The Act would, for example, support parents who want to opt their children out of offensive sex education programs.   However, the Act not only protects parents' rights vis a vis education, but also prohibits government interference with regard to medical decisions for their children, reasonable corporal punishment of their children, and the direction of, or provision for, religious teaching for their children.   Some pro-life groups have some concern that the medical decision provision of the Act would prohibit governmental intervention in cases where parents attempt to coerce a daughter into having an abortion.  Similarly, there is currently some doubt as to whether the Act would indeed provide a counterbalance to privacy arguments against parental consent statutes, as it was originally envisioned.  The concept of statutorily restoring parents' rights is a good one, and, once the wording issues have been resolved, the Act will need support from pro-family citizens.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:	The bills will likely be introduced and debated this term.
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Defund Anti-Family Legal Activism</H3></CENTER>

<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The Legal Services Corporation is a federally-funded program created in 1974 to provide poor people with access to expensive legal services.  In actuality, LSC serves as a deep well for anti-family litigation.  Each year hundreds of millions of dollars in legal services are donated to the poor from the private sector.  This $415 million a year pot of gold for the anti-family movement is not needed and should be abolished.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  There is no pending legislation dealing narrowly with Legal Services Corporation, but the House and Senate budget resolutions each call for rolling back LSC funding.  Thus, legislation which at least reduces funding of LSC is likely to come out of the Senate and House Appropriations Committees later this year.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Although there is no current legislation on LSC, pro-family groups, including FRC, are working on strategies for abolishing it.  These efforts include a letter to House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole calling for the defunding of LSC.  In mid-May, Sen. Phil Gramm's Appropriations Subcommittee on Justice, State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies held hearings on LSC.  Sen. Gramm pledged to fight the appropriation of money for LSC in the upcoming appropriations bill.  
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The Legal Services Corporation has operated for 15 years without Congressional authorization.  Yet it continues to be one of the most powerful weapons in the anti-family arsenal.  LSC has played a major role in expanding abortion, divorce and the homosexual agenda.  It has spent $5 billion since 1974 on outrageous litigation ranging from providing cable TV for prisoners to forcing states to fund sex-change operations.  LSC has been a major combatant against welfare reform.  Supporters of LSC claim that it balances the scales in a system where poor people are at a disadvantage because of the high cost of legal services.  But state and local governments as well as bar associations and individual lawyers already provide a great deal of legal aid to the poor.  Instead of helping poor people, LSC often joins the efforts of well-funded anti-family groups such as the ACLU and the National Organization for Women.  Moreover, LSC lacks oversight.  According to Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) oversight has dropped significantly during the Clinton Administration.  Two years ago over 150 on-site audits took place, compared with fewer than 10 this past year.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  The battle to defund the Legal Services Corporation will be a hard one.  Like many expensive government programs, LSC has appeal because it appears to help people in need.  Supporters will try to play to the public's sympathy for the poor, portraying those who want to cut the program as cruel.  But LSC's 21-year track record of radical anti-family activism will be brought to light during the debate.  Also, the deficit-conscious 104th Congress is more
likely to take a serious look at whether such programs are really necessary.

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=7>Time for another<BR>killer euphemism?</FONT><HR WIDTH=50%>
<P ALIGN="CENTER"><Align=center>
By Suzanne Fields<BR><FONT SIZE=1><Align=center>The Washington Times
</FONT><HR WIDTH=30%></center>
<BODY>

<BR><DD>In 1789 Jonathan Swift bewailed the shameful numbers of abortions and murders of &quot;bastard children&quot; among the Catholic peasants of Ireland, desperate women who sacrificed innocent babes to avoid the expense and the shame of giving birth without benefit of clergy. Such horrid practices, Swift wrote, &quot;would move tears and pity in the most savage and inhuman beast.&quot;

<BR><DD>In searching for a way to alleviate such cruelty, Swift invents an American, whom most Englishmen regarded as a not-so-noble savage, to support his modest proposal.

<BR><DD>&quot;I have been assured by a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London,&quot; he writes in a satire that became a classic of English literature, &quot;that a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious, nourishing, and wholesome food whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricassee or a ragout.&quot;

<BR><DD>Swift was only ahead of his time, and he was only kidding. His modest proposal was deliciously sly in appealing to an impeccable financial logic. His classic was a dig at the rapacious absentee English landlords of Ireland, whose money-grubbing tactics were condoned by the British parliament, ministers and the Crown.

<BR><DD>Taking a cue from Swift, the time is right for a similar modest proposal to President Clinton and all those congressmen who are willing to uphold his veto of the ban on &quot;partial-birth abortion.&quot;

<BR><DD>First the facts: a partial-birth abortion is the euphemism for the procedure of turning a baby around (with forceps) in the birth canal so that his tiny legs and tummy and arms escape the mother's body, allowing the doctor to stick a pair of scissors into his head while it is mostly still inside his mother's body. The doctor then spreads the blades of the scissors to allow him to insert a tube with which to suck out the tiny brain. Scientists who work with animals in a laboratory wouldn't be permitted to perform such nasty business.

<BR><DD>So heinous is the procedure that such abortions as are done are mostly to preserve the mother's health, usually her psychological health, since the procedure is done a few seconds before the baby's head slips free of the womb.

<BR><DD>And since psychology is so crucial, why should we deprive the mother-to-be of &quot;psychological closure&quot; by the technicality of keeping the head inside the birth canal while the procedure is being done? Why not do it outside, so that she can watch?

<BR><DD>Why not, in fact, provide a grace period of 15 minutes after birth, to allow her to decide whether she really wants to have a baby. Or even an hour. Perhaps a day or two. Why rush these things? The doctor's scissors would still work the next day.

<BR><DD>It's almost impossible to anesthetize an infant in the womb without putting the mother in great danger. But a baby who lives outside the womb for an hour or even a day could receive treatment to reduce pain prior to its execution. We shouldn't be barbaric, after all. The law, of course, must exempt this carefully considered procedure from charges of premeditated murder. We could give such infanticide a nice name like &quot;mercicide.&quot; The kindly Dr. Jack Kevorkian might offer the use of his death machinery.

<BR><DD>There is another great advantage to this scheme. By forcing the whole baby out of the mother's body for mercicide, we could decide at our leisure whether the infant is indeed a monster with four legs and no suitable brain, thus avoiding disposing of (we must watch our language) a Down's Syndrome child or a child with a cleft palate, both of which are justifiable reasons now for electing a &quot;partial-birth abortion.&quot;

<BR><DD>In fact, the law as it is now interpreted enables a mother of a normal baby to kill the child in the last trimester if the birth contributes to a mother's depression or neurotic excesses. Though it may be difficult for some to imagine that a loving adoptive mother would welcome a live baby with Down's Syndrome or a cleft palate, that option would be made available before mercicide, which is after all permanent.

<BR><DD>The advantages of this proposal are obvious and many, it seems to me, as well as of the highest importance to the body impolitic. To satisfy the squeamish who require the delicacy of euphemism, as the president seems to, we could describe mercicide as killing with kindness.

By Suzanne Fields<BR><FONT SIZE=1>The Washington Times
</FONT><HR WIDTH=30%></center>
<BR><DD>When Hillary Rodham Clinton is tempted to give in to self-pity, she ought to consider her sisters of earlier White House imprisonment. She and Eleanor Roosevelt were neither the first nor will they be the last to suffer outrageous slings and errors. Nor are they the most "victimized," in the fashion of the day. This pouring of new whine into old battles does not become a first lady.<BR><DD>She can consider herself lucky by comparison to Rachel Jackson, who was so vilified by the supporters of John Quincy Adams that she didn't live to move into the White House. She had wanted to skip the inauguration of her husband, but Andrew Jackson's friends warned that she mustn't give in to her tormentors lest they enjoy a "chuckle" at scaring her away.<BR><DD>She made plans to come to Washington, only to be reminded that her enemies not only called her an "adulteress" (and worse), but described her as "fat, forty, but not fair." Old Hickory himself was 61, but that didn't count. Buying a ball gown wasn't much fun. Rachel grew depressed and fell sick before she left Nashville, fulfilling a wish she had announced, paraphrasing the Psalmist, when she heard that her husband had won the election: "I had rather be a doorkeeper in the house of God than to live in that palace at Washington."<BR><DD>If it's a seance she wants, Hillary ought to run a short circuit to Mary Todd Lincoln, who also dabbled in spiritualism, even before there was a Psychic Friends Network, believing that she had supernatural powers to communicate with dead relatives. But despite Mary's confidence in her own prophetic powers, she couldn't foresee how wretched she would be as first lady.<BR><DD>Although she was loyal to the Union cause, many of her relatives, including two brothers, fought for the Confederacy. She was accused of being a traitor and a spy. The newspapers were merciless, even when Will, her 11-year-old son, died. Instead of showing the first lady a little sympathy in her grief, the newspapers attacked the style and "extravagance" of her mourning clothes.<BR><DD>Not only did Mrs. Lincoln endure the assassination of her husband, but when she became a widow, a Lincoln biographer argued, probably inaccurately, that Lincoln had only one real love in his life, Ann Rutledge, a woman who died before he met Mary Todd. On reading this, Mrs. Lincoln broke down and was eventually placed in a mental institution by a son.<BR><DD>Florence Harding, like Nancy Reagan, consulted an astrologer -- as a senator's wife, not as first lady. But why not? It was "Madam Marcia" who told her that her husband would become president of the United States and he would also have many sordid affairs. Madam Marcia was right on both counts. Futurespeak has a downside.<BR><DD>Mrs. Harding, like Hillary Clinton, was furious at those who protected her husband from her. President Harding continued to see Nan Britton, a favorite mistress, after he moved into the White House, occasionally partaking of Nan's favors in a coat closet adjoining the Oval Office. Once when Mrs. Harding heard that that woman was in the White House she set out to find her, and only because someone tipped his Secret Service detail did the president and Nan escape the wrath of "the Duchess."<BR><DD>Nor is Hillary the first first lady to make personal and public sacrifices to protect her husband. Bess Truman learned early in the election year of 1948 that the White House was collapsing, rotting from within. Mrs. Truman preferred to bear the accusation that she failed to initiate a formal social season than to give her husband's enemies the metaphor of a crumbling White House. The Trumans moved into the Blair House after he upset Tom Dewey, and the White House was renovated.<BR><DD>Jean Houston, Hillary's psychic friend, suggests that she carries the burden of 5,000 years of subservience to men, and compares her to Joan of Arc. Bob Woodward writes in his new book "The Choice," that Hillary "seemed jerked around by the muddled role of first lady as she swung between New Age feminist and national housewife."<BR><DD>The first lady cut short one session with Jean Houston to inquire into Chelsea's tummy ache. Thus a child's aching tummy brought the burden of 5,000 years of "female subservience" abruptly to earth -- where it belongs.<P><BR>

Dear Senator: 

I urge you to terminate Senator Alan Simpson's (R. WY) legal 
immigration proposal, S. 1394, at the Senate subcommittee 
level. 

The Senate immigration subcommittee will soon begin markup 
of S. 1394. Unfortunately, Senator Simpson's legal 
immigration legislation intensifies the restrictive measures
of Representative Lamar Smith's (R. TX) immigration 
proposal, H.R. 2202. 

Senator Simpson seeks a 25% tax on businesses that hire 
foreign workers. Under S. 1394, companies hiring foreign 
help would have to pay a tax equal to one-quarter of 
the employee's annual compensation including wages and 
benefits. In addition, employers would be forced to pay 
that employee 105% of the prevailing wage (an expansion of 
the job-killing Davis-Bacon Act). 

Additionally, the new limits on skilled immigration coupled 
with the arbitrary experience requirements will 
significantly lower the number of skilled workers admitted 
to the U.S. annually. Moreover, elimination of the unskilled
immigration visas, prevents families from uniting. Unskilled
immigrants do not displace American workers. The measures of
S. 1394 (and similary House proposals) will do more to 
displace American workers than any perceived move by 
employers to bypass American labor for foreign workers. 

Contrary to the less government principles espoused in 1994,
S. 1394 and similar House proposals, increase government 
spending, expand governmental control over businesses and 
will ultimately weaken the U.S. economy. I strongly oppose 
S. 1394, and I ask you to do the same. 

Sincerely,

Dear Senator:

It would be a big mistake to vote for an increase in the 
minimum wage.  A minimum wage hike will hurt the economy 
and cost jobs.

Economists have found that minimum wage increases cost jobs.
Hiking the minimum wage will keep many young people, 
especially minorities and unskilled workers, out of job 
opportunities.  The drive to raise the minimum wage is 
largely politically-motivated and driven.  But many people 
fail to see the destructiveness of minimum wage increases. 
As a small business owner, I know how difficult it is to 
absorb the costs of unfunded mandates like the minimum wage.

The minimum wage is a starting wage, it's a good way for the 
entry-level employees to gain employment experience.  
Studies show that 63% of minimum wage workers earn higher 
wages within a year.  Small businesses are able to determine 
wage scales much better than Congressmen or bureaucrats.

With the implementation of welfare reform, there will be 
many low skilled people looking for jobs -- it will be much 
harder for these Americans to find employment if Congress 
raises the minimum wage.

Now is definitely not the time to raise the minimum wage.  
Leave wage increases for minimum wage workers to the 
employers, not politicians.

Sincerely,

<center><h3>Written Testimony by<br>
William J. Bennett<br>
Former Director, Office of National Drug Control Policy
<p>
Delivered before the<br>
United States Senate<br>
Caucus on International Narcotics Control<br>
April 25, 1996</h3>
<p>
======================================================
<p>
</center>
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Caucus: 
<p>
Little more than a year ago I came before both the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight and the Senate Judiciary Committee to testify on the drug resurgence in America and the need for strong leadership and serious action.  The situation was serious then.  It is worse now.   Consider these events of the last fifteen months:

<ul>
<li>The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse reported that in 1995, almost three million 12 to 17 year olds used marijuana.  Among high school seniors, the users number one in three, according to the Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education.
<li>LSD was tried at least once by 11.7 percent of the class of 1995 -- the highest rate since record keeping began in 1975. [Monitoring the Future Study, December, 1995]
<li>The Office of National Drug Control Policy reports that "on the Texas border, the popular practice of smoking cocaine-laced 'blunts' [cigar-like marijuana cigarettes] may also be leading to an increase among teens of smoking crack."  
<li>In Chicago, a marijuana cigarette laced with both PCP and crack, called "Ozone," was marketed over the summer for $15.
<li>The popular culture, emboldened by a softened attitude toward drugs, escalated its glorification of marijuana.  Adidas brought out the "Hemp" shoe; Capricorn Records produced the album, "Hempilation;" and  20,000 young people gathered in Seattle to attend Hempfest '95.
<li>During the past year there has been a startling rise in the use of methamphetamine in California and the Southwest.  Last July we read the horrifying story of Eric Smith who, high on methamphetamine, murdered his son, cut off the boy's head, and threw it out the window of his van.
<li>It has been reported that having discovered how much money can be made, the citizens of Bolivia have gone into cocaine production rather than simply supply the raw material to other countries.  
<li>And, finally, the advocates of drug legalization have stepped into the breach and made their case vociferously during the past year.
</ul>
<p>
These are troubling trends.  But the good news is that the American people are not 
complacent.  The will to fight drugs is very much alive in the land.  Late last year, 
the Gallup Organization released the results of an extensive survey on American attitudes toward drugs.  The poll found that more than nine in ten Americans are intensely concerned about drug abuse, and that the issue of drugs rates second only to violent crime in seriousness.  When asked what they wanted to see a lot more of, more than half of the Gallup respondents cited strict law enforcement and education of the young, and two-thirds cited reduction of the supply of drugs coming into the United States.  Even more forcefully, by 85 percent, those surveyed rejected the despairing proposal that drugs should be legalized in America.  By contrast, fewer than half -- 43 percent -- asked for more treatment programs.
<p>
Clearly, citizens are aware of the devastating effect that drugs are having on 
society.  We are watching the addicts at the end of the pipeline getting 
older and sicker while seeing record numbers of young people enter the pipeline 
that leads to addiction.  In the face of all this, failure of leadership and lack of 
moral seriousness simply cannot be tolerated.  The federal government has to do a 
better job in this area.
<p>
There is no mystery to fighting drugs effectively.  This job is doable.  The
combined effort of vigorous foreign interdiction, tough and intelligent law
enforcement, accountability within the drug treatment system, and a morally firm 
attitude of intolerance toward drug use paid off in the last decade.  From the late 
1970s to the early 1990s, casual drug use by Americans dropped by over fifty 
percent.  Between 1985 and 1992, monthly cocaine use declined by almost eighty 
percent.
<p>
I commend you for holding these hearings and for the attempt to bring the drug 
issue to the top of the national political agenda.  That is certainly where it belongs.  
I urge the legislative branch to put all possible pressure on the executive branch
seriously to take up the fight.  We've done it before, and it was successful.  
Let's do it again.

<BR><FONT SIZE=6>It's 1996, and we're all from Arkansas</FONT></center><BR><DD>What a country. (If the polls are correct.) Most Americans think the president is probably a crook, more than half of them think his wife is the family bag man and a shrew besides, and 62 percent have concluded that the administration they preside over uses the power of the government to intimidate and blackmail private citizens.<BR><DD>And they want four more years of it.<BR><DD>Bill Clinton leads Bob Dole by 17 points, or 20, or 22, or 6. Whatever. Take the poll of your choice. Talk about the Stockholm Syndrome.<BR><DD>This is good news for people who sell newspapers, because the Scandal/Outrage/Screw-up of the Day sells newspapers. It's a shame for the country, but the bigger shame appears to be that the country doesn't any longer give a damn who a president is or what he does. Hot Springs is at last writ large.<BR><DD>A poll taken for the Wall Street Journal/NBC News and released late last week, not only shows Mr. Clinton up by a ton, but 44 percent are down on Hillary, 62 percent think she's lying about past deeds of graft and greed, 35 percent say they believe the president helped himself to public money to cover his Whitewater investment, and 68 percent say they believe the Clinton White House is using the FBI, illegally, to bullyrag opponents.<BR><DD>New revelations litter the landscape, if not yet the public consciousness. The books pour out a profusion of perversion, greed, incompetence and criminal bumbling. The Clinton crowd is exposed as a collision of clowns or crooks, and probably both. It's not the comedy, stupid, it's the stupidity.<BR><DD>We've become such a nation of soap-opera addicts, having mainlined Oprah and Phil Donahue and their cretinous compatriots for so long that we no longer aspire to be "the good nation" that Alexis de Tocqueville found here almost 200 years ago, when he observed that America was great because it was good and predicted that America would cease to be great when it ceased to be good.<BR><DD>We live in the New Age now, and happy is as happy does. A new book out this week, "Unlimited Access," by Gary Aldrich, an FBI agent assigned to the White House, details how the president assuages his melancholy memories of Gennifer, Sally, Paula, Kay and the other ladies of the wee hours he left behind in Little Rock. Mr. Aldrich describes how the prez leaps into the back seat of Bruce Lindsey's car, pulls a blanket over his head and doesn't come out until they're safely in a tunnel beneath the JW Marriott Hotel, just down Pennsylvania Avenue from the White House. He takes an elevator to a suite upstairs, where the late evening's yum-yum awaits. This would be the hour for the bad guys to unleash missiles, since nobody knows where he is for hours and hours. Hillary is safe in the arms of the Sandman.<BR><DD>This beats the arrangements in Little Rock, where he was reduced to using the front seat of a car on the deserted grounds of his daughter's school or the back seat of his limo on a side street at the foot of Main. But let's be fair. Bill Clinton is not the first president to slip around with the satin smoothness of the son of a preacher man. Warren Harding made a love nest of a closet off the Oval Office. Grover Cleveland made out like Bill Clinton before he got to Washington, leaving a love child in his wake, and JFK partook often of the consolations of forbidden feminine charms and, in a fit of populist bonhomie, even shared his treats with a Mafia don.<BR><DD>FDR had a squeeze, too, but his was a vice that paid the homage of hypocrisy to virtue, and nobody knew for sure for years afterward. This was in part due to diligence and careful competence, and in part the work of media that protect Democrats to conserve energies to ravage Republicans. Bob Packwood was hounded from office for kissing women in elevators, but when Bill Clinton was caught at dropping his drawers and demanding curb service it was his accuser who was held up to public ridicule. "I'm not interested in Bill Clinton's sex life," said Johnny Apple of the New York Times in a widely quoted (and widely copied) dismissal of the larger part of Bill Clinton's life and career.<BR><DD>Some people say that this merely reflects selective distaste, but Mr. Apple is not the only man in town who finds sex a vice unfit for the consideration of gentlemen. But polls indicate that a mean average of 61.3 percent of the rest have concluded that vice is nice at twice the price, and Bill Clinton is our man.<BR><DD>Robbing banks in Arkansas is old stuff, and doesn't count. Covering it up in Washington is what anybody would have done. Using the FBI to compile dossiers on "enemies" is sort of shoddy, but Republicans deserve it. Billy Dale might have been Everyman, but thinking about it can make a man's teeth itch.<BR><DD>Too bad for Bob Dole, but that's the way the cookie -- whoever she may be -- crumbles. We're all from Arkansas now.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<font size=7>Conservatism can close<BR>
Dole's gender gap</font><HR WIDTH=50%>
By Suzanne Fields<BR><FONT SIZE=1>The Washington Times
</FONT><HR WIDTH=30%></center><BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bob Dole is obsessed with the gender gap. All the pundits inside the Beltway say so. His gaffes, his turn-arounds, his flip-flops, his misspoken attitudes and waffles over abortion, the assault weapons ban, and a less-than-enthusiastic attempt to trash the affirmative action quota schemes that discriminate against the innocent, are meant to reach out to the women's vote.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>They aren't working. He's looking through the wrong end of the telescope. He's right to show tolerance for those with different opinions on abortion. His choice of Rep. Susan Molinari, an unusual one, as the keynote speaker at least sharply contrasts to the Democrats who wouldn't let Bob Casey, a former governor of Pennsylvania, even talk about his pro-life convictions in New York in 1992.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Bob Dole's record as a pro-life senator shouldn't be discounted by pro-lifers simply because he has lately become inarticulate on the subject. But he desperately needs to re-focus on what pro-life and many pro-choice women agree on. A majority of women in both parties want to ban the infanticide procedure euphemistically called "partial-birth abortion." They want to be notified if their under-age daughter seeks an abortion.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Elizabeth Dole gave her husband good advice when she told him to look at crime as a women's issue. A majority of women favor the ban against assault weapons, but few expect it to have much impact on their lives. A majority of women, like men, want dangerous criminals locked up for longer. That's always been a strong Republican issue and Mr. Dole ought to ask Bill Clinton how he hopes to reconcile midnight basketball and curfews as an effective approach to crime. Such ideas are the work of an illogical mind and reflect a pandering politician.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Affirmative action hurts ambitious women, and there are lots of ambitious women in this country today. Furthermore, they vote. Bob Dole ought to gather the facts and talk to women who are naturally receptive to conservative fiscal solutions.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>One of the most fascinating stories lost in the debate over affirmative action is the way that women are smashing through glass ceilings. These women don't need affirmative action and, in fact, many of them could be hurt by it, especially those among the large numbers of female entrepreneurs with small companies who don't need meddlesome and burdensome government mandates.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Women own and run a third of the businesses in the United States and 40 percent of all retail and service firms. According to the Public Interest, magazine women-owned and operated firms grew by 43 percent -- almost double the rate for all firms -- between 1987-1992 under Ronald Reagan and George Bush. These women also increased their payrolls by 100 percent, compared to 38 percent for all firms in the same period of time.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Women who look up and see only their reflections in the glass ceiling usually have made "quality of life" choices that determined their rank. Those who got in and duked it out like men are closing the wage gap, rapidly. Working women between the ages of 27 and 33 who have not had children earn 98 percent of what a man earns. A 2 percent disparity isn't fair, but it isn't bad and it's certainly not difficult to close.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Women who continue to earn less than men in their fields usually have chosen to work less and take off more time, mainly for the children. Women are more willing than men to give more points to "home and family" in measuring success, whether they work or not. These women especially appreciate lower taxes.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Women, traditionally the moral arbiters of our society, are fundamentally conservative. Many are deeply offended by Bill Clinton on character issues and appreciate the integrity they perceive in Bob Dole. So far this moral outrage hasn't registered in the polls, maybe because Mr. Dole hasn't talked directly to them. Now is the time if he is ever to do it.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for The Washington Times, is nationally syndicated.<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

character vs. the politics of style</FONT><P> <HR WIDTH=50%>By Suzanne
Fields<BR>The Washington Times<HR width = 30%>
</CENTER><BLOCKQUOTE><B><I><P>&quot;Character is the most effective means of
persuasion.&quot;<BR>-- Aristotle's
&quot;Rhetoric.&quot;</I></B></BLOCKQUOTE><P>No one studies rhetoric for the sake
of rhetoric any more. It's a politically incorrect discipline better left to those
funny men in togas in ancient Athens.<P>So why shouldn't Bill Clinton's State of
the Union speech and Bob Dole's response lack rhetorical flights of inspiration
and persuasion?<P>Most of the pop commentators gave Bill Clinton the usual edge,
but Bob Dole's remarks - not the unaccountably awkward delivery - actually had
more to say to the collective consciousness of a nation that is just now beginning
to listen to the men who want to be president in 1996.<P>Bob Dole was more clearly
focused, sharper with the points of criticism of Mr. Clinton's failed liberal
policies after the president had recited his new conservative agenda. But he
talked too fast from an empty room. He should have insisted on speaking from a
school or a courthouse in a small town in Kansas, or even Iowa or New Hampshire.
The contrast with the pomp and bombast of Washington would have been
exquisite.<P>We can take Aristotle's word for it. &quot;Persuasion,&quot; he wrote
2,500 years ago, &quot;is achieved by the speaker's personal character when the
speech is so spoken as to make us think him credible. His character may almost be
called the most effective means of persuasion.&quot;<P>Bill Clinton lacks that
most effective means of persuasion, credibility and character. He's the
quick-change artist, constantly challenging himself on the tight rope. He knows
how to talk the talk of conservatives when he's in the campaign mode, how to walk
the walk with veto pen in hand when he's with his fellow liberals.<P>Now in the
campaign mode, the president echoes Dan Quayle, Newt Gingrich and his merry band
of followers in the House, as well as Bob Dole, and his considerably less-merry
campers in the Senate. The president now seeks a welfare program that supports
families, unlike the present one which undermines families (and a lot like the one
he vetoed last month). He calls for smaller government, accepting the voters'
message in the 1994 elections, but thwarts attempts to cut the government we've
got down to size.<P>He pleads with the pop culture creators to produce movies,
television shows and CDs that &quot;you would want your own children and
grandchildren to enjoy.&quot; He could tell that to his Hollywood cronies, since
they're the ones who produce many of the very shows he affects to criticize.
They're also the ones who have contributed a significant portion of his $30
million campaign chest, and pols rarely want to offend big contributors. He
affected graciousness to Bob Dole, drawing attention to his service in World War
II, which also drew attention to Mr. Dole's age, like Mark Antony affecting praise
of Brutus at Caesar's funeral.<P>And Bob Dole is, as we all know, an honorable
man. He had the better lines but he didn't deliver them well. He hadn't quite
mastered the teleprompter and demonstrated a need for lessons in emphasis. By far
the most powerful sentence in his whole speech fused rhythm, thought and
conviction: &quot;Every political movement, and every public official, must locate
a place in his heart where compromise ends, a core of conviction where we keep our
conscience.&quot;<P>He tossed that sentence to the right wing of his party to let
them know he is more than the Washington deal-cutter, reinforcing the larger theme
that he intends to mock Bill Clinton on the issues of character and an authentic
political point of view.<P>The senator must find a way to turn wisdom, experience
and age to his advantage. It won't be easy. A young TV comedienne says Bob Dole
reminds her of her father, and why on earth would she vote for him. (But why would
she want to vote for her bumpkin uncle?) Bob Dole's not the kind of guy whose
briefs or boxers fascinate the MTV generation.<P>Despite his age, Bob Dole was hip
enough last month to board a flashy MTV bus in New Hampshire for a taped political
interview. He also talked to members at the Alpha Delta fraternity at Dartmouth
College, which was the model for the movie &quot;Animal House.&quot; He competed
with James Brown's shouting from boom boxes, amiably recalling his college days at
the University of Kansas, where pranksters at Kappa Sigma fraternity once carried
a brother's motorcycle to the third floor of the frat house.<P>&quot;Every
generation has its own set of problems, its own temptations,&quot; Mr. Dole told
them. &quot;We're not an old America, we're not a young America. We're one
America.&quot;<P>Suzanne Fields, a columnist for The Washington Times, is
nationally syndicated.<P> Copyright &#169 1996, News World Communications, Inc.

might think he was wearing his medals crooked.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT=""
ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>This was the most dramatic Washington suicide
since James Forrestal, the secretary of defense, leaped from a window at the top
of Bethesda Naval Hospital in 1947, pursued by the vicious demons and fierce
worms known only to himself, haunted by fears of the red menace when it was
not fashionable to be so haunted. It's already the second major suicide of the
Clinton administration, and as the going gets tougher, the curveballs breaking
ever more sharply across the plate, all the president's men must stand resolute
against despair.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30
HEIGHT=0>Like Vince Foster, Mike Boorda was by all accounts a man of splendid
character and moral stature, but, like Mr. Foster, he was over his head in the pool
of ego and ambition that the capital is and has been since the days when someone
was forever trying to set fire to George Washington's wooden teeth.<BR><IMG
SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>What other explanation can
there be for the suicide of a warrior who is expected to dispatch 19-year-old
boys -- and pregnant 19-year-old girls, to make the most shameful point -- to
court a briny death on the stormy sea but who so quails at the prospect of talking
to a reporter that he takes the weak man's out?<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT=""
ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>It's difficult to imagine that an old salt as
experienced as Mike Boorda would have killed himself over the misuse of his
medals, as dear as such decorations are to the men who understand the sacrifice
required to win them. It's not so difficult to understand why Washington, with its
unerring instinct for getting it wrong, took a crash course last week in how many
pins can dance on a campaign ribbon.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top
WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Adm. Boorda, though skillful enough at playing the
bureaucratic game to make it to the top of the sea service, might have understood
that at the end he had let down his beloved Navy by betraying it into the hands of
snotty Clintonoids who think that no opportunity must be missed to emasculate
the military the commander in chief has said he "loathes."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif"
ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The admiral conceded months before his
death that he reckoned that he had let down the Navy by caving in to the
pressures brought by the neurotic feminists inside and outside the Congress, and
the frightened senators (some of them Republicans) leaping to chairs, pulling up
their pants' legs to cry "eeeek!" when Pat Schroeder walks into the room, who
demanded the head of Adm. Stanley Arthur when he was nominated to be the
commander of the Pacific Command.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top
WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Adm. Arthur, a 500-mission hero of the Vietnam War
(enough already to condemn him to scorn and ridicule), was accused of reaching
an incorrect judgment when a female pilot filed a sexual-harassment claim
against her flight instructors. Upon investigation, Adm. Arthur ruled the claim
without substantial merit. The poor woman should count her lack of blessings;
she might have been assigned to the USS Acadia, "the Love Boat," which returned
from the Persian Gulf War with 10 percent of her crew in a family way, more in
need of diapers and bassinets than armor and bullets.<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif"
ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The promotion was held up by a single
senator, the self-righteously strange David Durenberger of Minnesota. "I should
have fought this to the end," Adm. Boorda conceded to the Navy Times. "I helped
screw it up, and I don't feel good about it."<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT=""
ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>That made everything A-OK, of course. "Feeling
good" is what life in Bill Clinton's America is all about. But not to everyone. Jim
Webb, another authentic hero of Vietnam who was Ronald Reagan's secretary of
the Navy, demanded of the weak John Dalton, the Clintonoid secretary of the Navy,
and of Mike Boorda: "Where was the outrage?"<BR><IMG SRC="nop.gif" ALT=""
ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>But outrage is not appropriate in a Navy fit for a
lady, and a ladies' Navy is what we've got.

the great railroad job</FONT></CENTER><P>When Bill Clinton says he &quot;feels
your pain,&quot; he means it. He wants to spread the pain around so that he can
feel everybody's.<P>Last week he made a good start.<P>You could ask Billy Dale.
You could ask David Kendall, his lawyer for financial felonies, now in the toils
of a grand jury himself. You could ask Bob Bennett, his lawyer for bimbo
misdemeanors. You could ask Mike McCurry, his press agent.<P>You could even ask
Hillary, but she's still taking pills for her amnesia.<P>Mr. Dale is entitled to
laugh last, if he feels like laughing through his pain. Never has a railroad job
failed so deliciously.<P>Mr. Dale is going to get back a lot of the money he was
forced to borrow to pay for the lawyers to help him defend himself against
Hillary's false witness. (Miss Hillary, who wants us to believe that she went to
Sunday school between the beatings she got at the hands of the roving gangs of
5-year-olds then terrorizing her Republican neighborhood, might spend a few hours
between grand jury appearances to reflect on what the Bible says about bearing
false witness. She could start with the 20th chapter of the Book of Exodus and
look in on Proverbs 19:05 and 21:28.)<P>Mike McCurry is not laughing, but neither
is Bob Bennett. Mr. Bennett was assigned by the president to get on TV to trash
Billy Dale, to ruin his reputation in retaliation for his having humiliated the
Clintons in court, and in his zest for the assignment poor Uncle Bob revealed
himself to be not only a great pleader - he's a member of that mighty fraternity
of Blackstones whom the innocent cannot afford - but almost as factually
challenged as his famous client.<P>He said, OK, Mr. Dale might have beaten the
rap, but it was not a knockout, only a TKO: Mr. Dale had offered to plead guilty
to embezzlement in return for a four-month prison sentence. This was great
breakfast theater, suggesting that just because Billy Dale was not a felon that
didn't mean he wasn't a bum. But it wasn't so. He never agreed to say he had done
something he hadn't. When he was called on it, Mr. Bennett was revealed to have
gotten his facts, such as they were, all wrong. (He also violated the confidence
that parties to plea-negotiating have a right to expect, if the ethics committee -
please do not laugh - of the bar association is listening.) What also was not
clear was why anyone would believe anything any mouthpiece, $500 an hour or not,
would say in such a situation. A lawyer's declamation in defense of his client is
about as useful as calling your mother as a character witness.<P>At the next press
briefing, a reporter started to ask Mike McCurry a perfectly reasonable question
about Uncle Bob and Billy Dale, but before the reporter could get to his question,
Mr. McCurry cut him off: &quot;People have said some things and, frankly, the
president finds some statements that have been made objectionable. I am referring
specifically to comments on plea bargaining. ... We didn't put Bennett out to say
anything bad about Billy Dale, that's the bottom line. We made it pretty clear
after that happened that we didn't appreciate that type of
commentary.&quot;<P>Nothing ambiguous about who and what Mike was talking about.
Bob Bennett read it that way, too, and he used up a pocketful of a luckless
client's quarters calling the White House until he finally got to the president,
who felt his pain at once. The president told him that he had done &quot;a great
job&quot; on Billy Dale.<P>By the end of the next day, Mike was feeling pain. He
was sent out to retract all the honorable stuff he had said about Mr. Bennett's
treatment of Billy Dale. &quot;It is not objectionable for the president's
attorney to defend the president once he is under attack during some of these
television talk-show programs. ... And it is not objectionable for Mr. Bennett
simply to repeat something that has been published. ... There was a notion ...
that the White House has a campaign out there to tar and feather Billy Dale. I'm
satisfied that's not true. I'm satisfied that the president would find that
objectionable if that were true.&quot;<P>This is now all so familiar. Depending on
who Mr. Clinton was talking to, he thought that (a) Bob Bennett had done &quot;a
great job&quot; trashing Billy Dale; (b) Mike McCurry had done &quot;a great
job&quot; telling Bob Bennett what a jerk he was for trashing Billy Dale; and (c)
Billy Dale had done &quot;a great job,&quot; too.<P>Attorney General Janet Reno
also did &quot;a great job,&quot; putting out a Justice Department report saying
that the White House did not pressure the FBI to investigate the travel-office
employees. This has infuriated some people at the FBI who understand that the only
people who did &quot;a great job&quot; were the railroad men: The director of the
FBI works for Janet Reno, who works for President Clinton, who works for the first
lady.<P>The job Hillary did, however, was not so great.<P>Copyright &#169 1996,

To Succeed, Seattle Should Share the Olympics </CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER><I>by Bruce Chapman</I></CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="starbar.gif" WIDTH="468" HEIGHT="25" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3"><BR>
<BR>
The Seattle Bid Committe that is spearheading the drive to bring the Olympics
to Seattle and the Northwest in 2008 has entered a new, post-Atlanta phase.
First, the organizational effort is about to be intensified. Entrepreneur
Clark Kokich will operate as chairman of the committee, and internationally
known events impressario Bob Walsh will lead planning, as before. But to
provide day-to-day continuity, Dave Syferd, a noted public relations and
marketing executive, is expected to be named soon as president. The Seattle
Sports and Events Council is loaning staff to the project.<BR>
<BR>
The second post-Atlanta development is a growing recognition among supporters
that the early inspiration to seek the games on as broad a regional basis
as possible was wise and should be re-enforced. Indeed, the regional approach
would seem to have been vindicated both by the over-crowding in Atlanta
and the results of a recent Western Washington poll on the Olympics.<BR>
<BR>
Public backing in the poll actually grows when the idea is broached to make
the games a regional affair centered in Seattle, but with events staged
throughout &quot;<A HREF="cascadia.html">Cascadia</A>.&quot; This would
seem to reflect wholly legitimate concerns about traffic congestion and
about cost. If the Olympics are held on a regional basis, both traffic and
overhead expenses can be spread from Victoria and Vancouver to Portland,
though primary emphasis will remain on the Central Puget Sound area and
the official host city, Seattle. <BR>
<BR>
In Atlanta, though a few events were staged outside the metropolitan area,
regionalism was an afterthought. Central Atlanta was closed down and the
focus of non-event activity was on the new, 21 acre Centennial Park--less
than a third the size of Seattle Center. Yet, it was also Atlanta's ambition
to host the largest spectator audience ever for the Olympics. Nine million
tickets were printed. <BR>
<BR>
The solution for Seattle is 1) regionalize to the full extent feasible,
and 2) prune the spectator ticket sales back to the four million figure
typical of earlier Olympic Games, or at least to the five million number
Sydney will print for 2000. There is good reason to think that the International
Olympics Committee (IOC) will like this approach. It was Atlanta&iacute;s
idea, not the IOC&iacute;s, that bigger necessarily was better.<BR>
<BR>
It is probable that the IOC, with Atlanta&iacute;s experience to remind
it, also will approve of Seattle&iacute;s plan to share many Olympic events
with its neighbors. The IOC requires a single city to take the lead, or
else the organizing commitee already would be moving forward with a multi-city
or regional bid. Oregonians and British Columbians already serve on the
bid committee and Seattle area participants all want bi-national regional
cooperation to develop as one of the identifiable achievements of the games.
Victoria hosted the Commonwealth Games recently and Vancouver has splendid
new facilities, as does Portland. It would be a mistake not to share many
of the Olympics&iacute; 271 events with these neighbors. <BR>
<BR>
Closer to home, Tacoma and Everett are logical hubs for various events.
A new equestrian facility already contemplated for Ellensburg will help
pull events over the mountains into Eastern Washington. And what about the
state capital, Olympia? How could we pass up holding some of the classic
&quot;Olympic&quot; competitions in the city with the same name as Olympia,
Greece, the games' birthplace almost 2800 years ago?<BR>
<BR>
In further response to the traffic issue, Seattle itself would not anticipate
closing off the downtown or concentrating recreation and cultural events
in one small area. We already have a large and lively urban core with far
more attractions to disperse crowds than Atlanta had. Also, the Seattle
sponsors would integrate local government and citizen planning on both security
and transportation early on, as Atlantans, unfortunately, failed to do.<BR>
<BR>
But what about local costs, even with sharing? Didn't Atlanta's businesses,
individuals and government wind up paying nearly $2 billion for the games?
Yes, but they brought in over $4 billion. The metropolitan area was beautified,
its infrastructure--from road surfaces to new recreation, housing and park
facilities--was immensely improved. Thousands of young people gained news
skills and work experience, representing an untold increase in &quot;human
capital.&quot; Community groups pulled together and made regional alliances.<BR>
<BR>
Hosting the games, as Atlanta found out, is no panacea for poor planning
or other urban ills, but the games--the world's biggest event, and a positive
one--do represent a useful forward strategy. In Barcelona, host to the 1992
Olympics, the games (according to the mayor, quoted in the Wall Street Journal)
&quot;were fantastic, but it was only a 15 day dream.&icirc; Thanks to his
city&iacute;s revitalization, &igrave;The best moment in Barcelona is now.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Of course, there remains perhaps the biggest question: Could Seattle win
the games in the first place? Consider, for example, the image problem.
A Seattleite who was in Atlanta found himself marooned at a restaurant during
one of the frequent downpours that were common this past sticky summer --and
every summer. Sitting there, he mentioned to a local citizen Seattle's interest
in hosting the games in 2008.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Seattle?&quot; replied the Atlantan incredulously. &quot;But it rains
all the time in Seattle!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
News flash to the IOC: Late July and early August in Seattle are golden.<BR>
<BR>
My colleagues in Discovery Institute's Cascadia project are conducting a
feasibility study to examine a range of other real and imaginary obstacles
to Seattle's hosting the Olympics. If the whole region, working together,
cannot master those difficulties, then, by all means, the Olympic games
effort should be abandoned.<BR>
<BR>
But what a mistake it would be not to find out!<BR>

<BR><DD>The baby boomers flooded the culture with post-pubescent rebellion: &quot;Never trust anyone over 30.&quot;

<BR><DD>Adults trembled and then surrendered. Now the boomers are on the back side of 30 themselves and their children are saying: &quot;Never trust anyone over 13.&quot;

<BR><DD>Brittany, 13, is typical. She lives in a small New England town where her parents moved to get away from big-city problems. The big-city problems have moved into their town and into their living room.

<BR><DD>&quot;What she watches and hears from television and her peers on the bus to school deprives her of childhood innocence,&quot; her mother tells me. &quot;We can't control the other children, but we thought we could control our own daughter.&quot;

<BR><DD>Brittany's parents put a &quot;family-code lock&quot; on MTV so she wouldn't watch too much television. But Brittany is bright and she broke the code. Retaliating, she put her own code lock on the &quot;Discovery Channel,&quot; her parents' favorite.

<BR><DD>On the way to school, one of Brittany's buddies laced a large Coke with vodka and passed it around on the bus. She wound up in the emergency room, dead drunk.

<BR><DD>What we have here is a variation of the inmates taking over the asylum. With computer-literate, media-saturated, middle-class children poised for revolt, it's more difficult than ever for parents to maintain their position of authority.

<BR><DD>Not so long ago we accepted terms like &quot;identity crisis&quot; as a normal stage of development that adolescents would be expected to pass through. But today young people are exposed to so much &quot;adult&quot; information without the emotional development or psychological security to cope with it that parents are terrified.

<BR><DD>We look for one-shot elixirs to enable them to cope. We try to prevent teen-age pregnancy by distributing condoms at school. That sounds reasonable, but it plays to the lowest common denominator among us. The girl who would say &quot;no&quot; because she's afraid to get pregnant is reminded that the school provides condoms for squeamish young girls just like herself. How could it be bad?

<BR><DD>Movie and television producers, sensing a growing movement for censorship, offer ratings so parents will know what their children shouldn't watch. That only makes such shows and movies more desirable, of course, and the children quickly find the latchkey kid with no supervision at home. They hang out there to watch whatever they want.

<BR><DD>Most of us remember our own teen-age traumas and figure that those of our children will pass, too. But parents raising teen-agers today can't be so sure. The starting place for belligerence is so far beyond where the baby-boomer parents ended their rebellion that the test of limits is limitless. Today's teen-agers tolerate graphic sexuality and violence that would have made their parents throw up.

<BR><DD>Children are entering puberty at younger ages, some as early as 10. They're more likely to want to separate themselves from their families when parental protection is absolutely essential. Their mothers burned their bras; their daughters never get one. Young girls of another generation who would debate who to go out with, and &quot;how far to go,&quot; now debate when and with whom to have uncommitted and casual sex.

<BR><DD>We could begin to change some of this by pointing out that rhetorical and abstract appeals to sexual equality are false and misleading, hiding a multitude of dangerous differences starting at puberty. What once made up a teen-ager's fantasy life quickly became a short cut to coarsened reality. Parents must repeat and re-establish moral principles that reinforce an understanding of the difference between the sexes, enabling young women to once more become the arbiters of what's acceptable and what's not, because they're the ones who have the most to lose.

<BR><DD>This started out to be a column about the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act, pending in Congress, which is an attempt to give parents a veto power over policies in schools that they say undermine them. It sounds good, but it won't take the place of parents paying close attention to their own children. Nothing else, in the end, will work.

<BR><FONT SIZE=6>Let's blame the dead for the scary stuff</FONT></center><BR><DD>These guys at the White House are fast learners.<BR>
  George Stephanopoulos sees how Mortuary Bob Woodward gets by with talking to men lying in comas and crediting the most unlikely assertions in his books to sources conveniently dead, so George does it, too.<BR><DD>It wasn't Hillary who hired Craig Livingstone to vacuum raw FBI files to put together dossiers on their Republican enemies, says the president's senior adviser. "It was Vince Foster."<BR><DD>Dead men not only tell no tales, they don't dispute tales, either.<BR><DD>This emboldens Hillary. She was in Romania and Eastern Europe for the Fourth of July holiday (where she didn't have to put up with a lot of tacky flag-waving by men in military uniform parading down the avenue), but she supports Mr. Stephanopoulos in his blaming of Vince Foster, who, though still dead, has his uses yet.<BR><DD>Said she, repeating the White House mantra the nation has heard over and over in Clintonoid answers, some under oath and some not, to all questions about Whitewater: "I don't know anything about it."<BR><DD>She has no idea who hired the hapless Mr. Livingstone: "I know I didn't."<BR><DD>She doesn't like Gary Aldrich's new book, either. "It is a politically inspired fabrication, and I don't think anyone should take it seriously."<BR><DD>But the White House is taking it seriously indeed, mounting a full-scale offensive we hadn't seen since, well, since Bill and Hillary attacked Gennifer Flowers' claims that she had been Mr. Clinton's main squeeze for years and years in Little Rock, when Miss Flowers produced a tape recording of beddy-bye conversation that included Mr. Clinton's suggestion that Mario Cuomo was a Mafia asset. (Mr. Clinton denied saying it, of course, but apologized the next day to Mr. Cuomo for saying what he never said. Of course, it never happened, but he would never do it again.)<BR><DD>Americans soon learned what Arkansans had learned before them, to their considerable sorrow, never to take the first denial as the last word from either Clinton.<BR><DD>Mr. Stephanopoulos, citing widespread coverage of the Aldrich book by newspapers and lecturing David Brinkley on the ethics of journalism, complains that Washington newspapermen and journalists seem willing to believe anything malicious, salacious or promiscuous about his bosses. Journalists, in his view, don't enforce a high-enough credibility threshold.<BR><DD>What he means is that when someone tells the story that the prez sneaks off in the middle of the night to visit a bimbo -- no doubt to discuss Bosnia policy -- almost everyone is likely to believe it. True or not, the most risible rumor has the ring of truth. Sad that may be, but whose fault is that? Nothing but hoots of disbelief would have greeted a story like that about Jimmy Carter. The trouble Mr. Clinton and his men have on occasions like this is that he, like Jimmy Carter, has a track record.<BR><DD>We've all come to recognize the track record. First the denial -- in the case of the Aldrich book, not exactly a categorical denial -- and then the White House smear attacking "the Republican smear." Finally, days or weeks later, the facts dribble out, confirming the original story.<BR><DD>We're near the end of the first stage of this controversy, with Mr. Stephanopoulos attacking not Gary Aldrich, but Bob Dole, of all people, demanding that he disavow the book that has so panicked the White House, but that Mr. Dole has had nothing to do with.<BR><DD>The White House is not really concerned about the reputations of either Clinton. It's too late for that. But if the allegations in the Aldrich book -- like the allegations in the Meredith Oakley book, the Roger Morris book, the James Stewart book, the Bob Tyrrell book to come, take a number -- begin to stick, it's curtains for the Clintons. At some point the wonderfully/woefully tolerant American public will decide that we've had enough of Flem Snopes' grandson and his unblushing parvenue bride.<BR><DD>The White House knows how to read polls, and knows what not to attribute to them. <BR><DD>The Wall Street Journal reported only last week how some Democratic congressional candidates, even in liberal districts, are putting a little distance between themselves and the president.<BR><DD>Says John Tierney, a Democratic candidate in Massachusetts: "I'm campaigning on my own strengths." Says Steve Eastaugh, a Democratic challenger in Maryland: "A person's not worth spit if he doesn't defend his team captain. But I don't defend Clinton." Even the Democratic candidate to succeed Patsy Schroeder in Colorado says, with emphasis, that she's "not a Clinton Democrat."<BR><DD>"They're being prudent," says Charles Cook, a political analyst. "They don't know what's coming next." Too bad for George, but who does?<BR><BR><FONT SIZE="-2">Copyright &copy; 1996 News World Communications, Inc.</FONT>

<h2>Men & Abortion</h2><p>
<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html">
<b><i>Kathleen Howley</i></b></a><br> 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I am going to try to say this without sounding like a man-hating 
feminist. Here goes. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There are few things in life more disgusting than men who, when 
discussing abortion, use the phrase: "I can't tell a woman what to do 
with her body." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's like a password. It's usually pronounced with a self-satisfied 
smile. They're saying, "I'm cool. I'm a supportive kinda guy. I'm 
sensitive to the needs of women." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yea, right.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sometimes, there's a slight reluctance in their voice as they recite 
the mantra. Those are the ones who believe that while they, 
personally, are opposed to abortion, they couldn't tell a 
woman...blah, blah, blah. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
You've heard it before, I'm sure. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In most cases, these guys have never, in their lives, used the words 
"chaste" and "dating" in the same sentence. You can bet that many of 
them are pretty adroit at telling a woman what to do with her body, if 
it happens to serve their own needs. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Abortion, or "choice," as it's euphemistically called, becomes a 
requirement, for many of them, because it has the ability to erase any 
unforeseen problems caused by their lack of moral discretion. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I was at a G.O.P. cocktail party last week, and a man used that old 
line on me: "I can't tell a woman what to do with her body."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I gave him the logical response: "What about the body inside her womb? 
What if it's a male body, a little boy? Surely that can't be her body, 
because she can't be a man and a woman at the same time. Can you tell 
her, in that case?" 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
He looked at me glumly. This was not the response he expected. He 
probably assumed, because I'm a young woman, that I'm pro-choice.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Not a wise move. Three major studies within the last four years show 
that women tend to be more pro-life than men.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Makes sense, doesn't it? We're the ones with the maternal instincts, 
and if we know the facts of life -- meaning all the stuff you never 
read in the newspaper, such as what an abortion does to an unborn 
child -- many of us come down on the side of the baby. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I've been around enough men to know that they occasionally daydream 
about great feats they would perform if, for example, they suddenly 
found themselves trapped, with their whole platoon, under enemy fire. 
It's one of the most charming qualities of men, this desire to prove 
themselves to be brave and fearless. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But, so many men fail to realize that all around them, in our modern 
world, are opportunities to show their valor. Every day, they are 
confronted with opportunities to witness to the truth -- situations 
which, perhaps, take more courage than saving a platoon from enemy 
attack. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Once a month, I attend a rosary vigil with about 200 people in front 
of a local Planned Parenthood clinic. I see the woman going in for 
abortions, some reluctantly, some being steered through the door by a 
man who is probably the father of the baby.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
After about 45 minutes, some of the men come out, alone, looking 
relieved. They did their duty and sat in the waiting room with their 
significant other until it was time for the abortion, and then they 
get to go off -- get a cup of coffee, read the paper -- while she's in 
the recovery room.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What bothers me is that most of these guys are dressed as if they were 
on a date -- as if they were on the way to the movies. Except, this 
date involves the destruction of their children, and the wounding of 
their girlfriends. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
I'm with the early feminists, when it comes to abortion. Elizabeth 
Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Dr. Alice Bunker Stockham, and the 
whole crowd of them were staunchly pro-life. They called abortion 
"child murder," and the "exploitation of women and children." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More emphatically, they pointed out that abortion primarily serves the 
needs of the predatory male. In a July, 1869, article in "The 
Revolution," the feminist newspaper edited by Elizabeth Cady Stanton 
and Susan B. Anthony, the latter -- of current U.S. one-dollar coin 
fame-- wrote: 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Guilty? Yes, no matter what the motive, love of ease, or a desire to 
save from suffering the unborn innocent, the woman is awfully guilty 
who commits the deed. It will burden her conscience in life, it will 
burden her soul in death; but oh! thrice guilty is he who, for selfish 
gratification, heedless of her prayers, indifferent to her fate, drove 
her to the desperation which impels her to the crime." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In her day, Susan B. Anthony was describing a tiny minority of men. 
Today, you'll run into hordes of them at just about any political 
cocktail party you attend. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But, still, there are countless other men who dare to swim against the 
tide -- men who respect life, and respect women, at a time when 
neither is required by the world. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Those are men who don't have to daydream about performing feats of 
great valor. They do it every day.

<title>Howley: The American President -- 3/22/96</title>

<h2>
The American President
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Kathleen Howley
</a>

<P>
Everyone needs a hobby. Mine is trying to figure out the way Liberals 
think. Every time I think I have it nailed down, though, the Liberals 
pitch a curve ball.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Take, for example, "The American President," the movie about a highly 
paid female lobbyist who has an affair with the widowed President of 
the United States.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To Liberals, she's an "old-fashioned girl," because, after all, she 
waits until the third date to spend the night at the White House. Not 
the first date, mind you -- she's no tramp, after all. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The president's young daughter gets wind of the ongoing affair. She 
approves, as it turns out. When the relationship becomes public and 
some Angry White Male Conservative senators object, they're dismissed 
as being "intolerant."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Of course, the simple solution to the controversy is for the president 
and his girlfriend to get married. It would shut up the big, bad 
Conservatives, and, since it's an election year, it would also give 
the president a boost in the polls. The whole country would fawn over 
the newlyweds. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But, it never comes up. The word "marriage" is never spoken -- not by 
the Conservatives, as they plot their election coup. Not by the happy 
couple, as they snuggle in front of the fire at Camp David. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Here's the part that's hard to understand: Liberals perceive the 
president -- a character modeled, obviously, on a spiffed up version 
of Bill Clinton -- as a man of integrity, despite the bad example he 
sets for his daughter. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That view becomes apparent in the final scene, when the president 
makes a dramatic stand in defense of Liberal environmental 
legislation. Yes, I could almost hear the Clintonites sobbing in 
admiration. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
How could a character with no moral backbone be portrayed as being 
honorable? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's the same question I was left with at the end of "Primary Colors," 
the anonymous account of the Clinton campaign.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sure, Gov. Jack Stanton (read: Clinton) sleeps with every female in 
sight. Sure, he impregnates the teenage daughter of a friend. Sure, 
he's a pathological lier.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
He really CARES about America, though. And that makes everything all 
right.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Meanwhile, Mrs. Stanton/Clinton is no slacker when it comes to 
extramarital affairs. According to the book, she sleeps with Henry 
Burton, alias George Stephanopoulos. But, that's dismissed as merely 
being "campaign sex."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At the end of "Primary Colors," Gov. Stanton/Clinton is presented with 
some under-cover dirt on his opponent. Leaking it to the press would 
secure the primary nomination. But, it's just dirt about sex and drugs 
-- nothing really bad, from a Liberal's perspective. Should he use it? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One of his aides tells him, "We don't do this sort of thing. We're 
better than that." In the end, Stanton/Clinton decides to take the 
high road.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Once again, I could almost hear the Liberals weeping in admiration. 
What a man of courage! What a leader!  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It explained to me why there have been no denials forthcoming from the 
White House about the book -- no statements of shock or dismay. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
You see, to Liberals, it's a relatively positive portrayal. Yes, the 
candidate has a fatal flaw in his inability to be faithful to his 
wife. But, that doesn't really count. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
He refused to engage in "dirty tricks." And that makes him a hero. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
You might ask yourself: how could two groups of Americans -- Liberals 
and Conservatives -- view the same events with such a radically 
different interpretation? How can Liberals dismiss sexual morality 
from the mix, when deciding who has integrity and who doesn't? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More to the point, how can the Liberal-dominated media lionize 
characters who have such obvious flaws? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's because the Liberals are working from a different set of rules. 
And, as long a politician doesn't break the Liberal code of 
conduct, he's a man of integrity. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In short, they follow Ten Commandments, too. But, they're a bit 
different from the code that has guided Christians through the 
millenniums. The Liberal version is: 
<p>
<ol> 
<li>) Thou shalt be nice, except to people who are Conservatives. 
<li>) Thou shalt be inclusive, except to Conservative views. 
<li>) Thou shalt ignore the Lord's Day, unless you are a politician and 
need a "photo op" as you exit a church. 
<li>) Thou shalt blame thy mother and thy father. 
<li>) Thou shalt kill the old, the sick, and the unborn, but 
passionately defend the lives of death row criminals. (Unless you're 
an election-year politician who wants to look "tough on crime." In 
that case, kill them all, including the criminals.) 
<li>) Thou shalt commit adultery, and engage in any other mode of 
sexual expression, with any gender. But, thou shalt not feel guilty. 
<li>) Thou shalt steal, if it helps to re-distribute wealth. 
<li>) Thou shalt lie, if it furthers the Liberal cause. 
<li>) Thou shalt covet thy neighbors wife. 
<li>) Thou shalt covet thy neighbors goods. 
</ol>

<h2>Old TV Makes A Comeback</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"><b><i>Kathleen Howley</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
 
I stopped watching mainstream television shows almost two years ago. I 
finally cracked.  <p>

One of the last straws was an episode of "Seinfeld" -- a well-written 
series that was relatively clean in its first year, but gradually 
ended up in the gutter. <p>

Jerry, after sleeping with his new girlfriend, decides that he doesn't 
like her. So, he asks a buddy how many more dates he has to waste on 
her so he can break up with her "like a gentleman."  
<p>
Has womanhood fallen so low in America? Is respect for females so 
absent, and the standards of gentlemanly conduct so warped? 
<p>
The answer is, "Yes." But, but, must we be continually reminded? 
<p>
I resolved -- after that episode, and others that were even worse -- 
to honor the old-time computer motto: "Garbage in, garbage out." 
<p>
Watching shows that featured members of my generation sinking to the 
bottom of a moral pit -- although being very witty in the process -- 
was bound to effect any viewer, eventually. Makes sense, doesn't it?   
<p>
So, I decided to go cold turkey. 
<p>
Now, I keep the TV tuned to either CNN, C-Span, or Nickelodeon, the 
cable station where Dick and Laura Petrie are still young, Mary Tyler 
Moore is still looking for a husband, and Lucy is still trying to get 
a spot in Ricky's nightclub act. 
<p>
Perhaps Nick at Night, advertised as "safe TV," has put me out of 
touch with popular culture. Recently, I asked a friend, "Did you watch 
Nick last night?" 
<p>
She replied, innocently, "Whose Nick?" 
<p>
And, last month, when I saw a road sign for New Rochelle during a trip 
to New York, I turned to a pal and asked, "Hey, do you know who lives 
there?"  
<p>
She didn't. 
<p>
But, a growing number of Americans could answer that question. TV 
shows that feature a better vision of America are making a comeback, 
as recounted in a recent Washington Times story. 
<p>
The article, titled, "Old television gives disgruntled viewers new 
hope," credits the "Dick Van Dyke" show -- set, of course, in New 
Rochelle, NY -- as being one of the most popular shows on "old TV." 
<p>
According to the article, Warner Brothers, Universal, Columbia and 
Paramount are all trying to start cable networks that will feature 
1960s and 1970s sitcoms. 
<p>
Old television is big. Very big. 
<p>
And, why not? The old shows remind us of a era, not so long ago, when 
Moms were at home when their kids came in the door from school, 
neighborhoods were safe, and marriages tended to last a lifetime. 
<p>
I was a baby when Dick Van Dyke made its original run in the 1960s, so 
I don't remember it first-hand. But, that was the America that I grew 
up in. Not such a bad world, after all. 
<p>
When I was a kid, my Mom used to send us out the door without worrying 
about us -- just like Laura did with Richie. Can you imagine? Even if 
we were a whole block away, there was another Mom nearby, keeping an 
eye on us through her kitchen window.  
<p>
The biggest part of our day was when Dad came home from work -- just 
like on the old sitcoms. We would crowd around him, looking for hugs. 
The dog would bark. It was general pandemonium. 
<p>
Now, the biggest part of the day for many American children is the 
moment when Dad or Mom walks through the door of their daycare center 
to take them home for a few short hours, before returning them the 
next morning. 
<p>
Today's network executives have a strange sense of what "family 
values" means. They claim their new fall lineup is dominated by family 
shows.  
<p>
But, the most normal family they could come up with is portrayed in 
"Bless This House." According to the previews, it portrays a family 
with "rock solid values."  
<p>
Unfortunately, the actor who plays the husband is Andrew Dice Clay -- 
a real-life comedian known for his obscene nightclub acts. 
<p>
In addition, TV executives this year came up with 10 new "family 
shows" with divorced or single parents. Some would call that being 
"realistic." I call it, "accentuating the negative." 
<p>
Also, on the heels of the already-established "NYPD Blue," touted as 
the first R-rated television series, there are at least a half-dozen, 
brand-new "adult" shows bent on breaking new ground. Half feature law 
firms. The rest feature news rooms. 
<p>
TV Guide describes one of them as containing "gratuitous lewdness." 
Remember -- in the eyes of TV Guide, that's not necessary meant to be 
critical.  
<p>
Another contains "risqu scenes." A third is described as "seductive." 
<p>
If the writing is good, and the story lines are interesting, the new 
R-style shows will probably attract even some Americans who try to 
live according to higher principles.  
<p>
And, despite their good intentions, they will slowly, bit by bit, be 
corroded.  
<p>
After all, garbage in, garbage out. 
<p>
Give me that old-time TV, any day of the week. 
<p>

<title>Howley:  The Catholic Church(es) in China</title>
</head>

<h2>The Catholic Church(es) in China</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"><b><i>Kathleen Howley</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
 
 
Americans are in the dark when it comes to the Catholic Church in 
China -- or, I should say, the two Churches in China: one, the 
underground Roman Catholic Church, the other, the Communist-controlled 
Patriotic Catholic Church. 
<p>
To illustrate the degree of confusion, Joseph Kung, the nephew of 
Ignatius Cardinal Kung, the much-beloved bishop of Shanghai, tells the 
following story: 
<p>
He was at a pro-life dinner last year in New Jersey. A monsignor 
tapped him on the shoulder, introduced himself, and said: "I just saw 
your uncle. He gave a speech at the seminary this morning." 
<p>
Joseph Kung knew his uncle had not been at the seminary that day, and 
immediately realized that the monsignor was talking about the OTHER 
bishop of Shanghai -- Aloysius Jin Luxian, S.J., appointed by the 
Communists and consecrated without the Holy Father's permission. 
<p>
After Kung explained the situation, the monsignor replied: "I had no 
idea. I thought I was listening to the Roman Catholic bishop of 
Shanghai. And, so did all the other people at the lecture." 
<p>
Generous Catholics in America have donated millions of dollars to aid 
the Catholic Church in China. Few realize that their money is helping 
to support the Patriotic Church. 
<p>
Still, the real Catholic Church in China is alive and growing 
stronger, despite the fact that it is persecuted, penniless, and, it 
would seem, friendless. 
<p>
Chinese Roman Catholics celebrate their Masses in hiding, or, during 
bolder moments, in open fields. They risk life and limb to protect 
their underground priests and seminarians. Their families pray the 
Rosary in secret.  
<p>
Life would be easy if they would just align themselves with the 
Patriotic Catholic Church. But, they won't. 
<p>
They follow the example of their shepherds, the loyal bishops who have 
refused to renounce the fullness of the faith, despite imprisonment 
and torture. Three years ago, one elderly bishop, Joseph Fan Xueyan, 
S.J., was beaten to death by his jailers. The rest of the world hardly 
noticed. But, his flock did. 
<p>
On the other hand, the Patriotic Church controls the real estate, the 
churches, and has approval from the Communist government and numerous 
Catholic bishops in the free world. Often, their seminarians study in 
America, supported by American dioceses. 
<p>
Bishops and priests of the Patriotic Church describe themselves as 
loyal members of the Catholic Church. Or, if they are willing to admit 
to their true status, they'll rationalize that the pope is "making 
overtures" to the Patriotic Church.  
<p>
The Holy Father has a certain brand of patience and tact that he uses 
when dealing with Communists -- a method he learned first-hand during 
his years in Poland. It's not to be confused with approval. 
<p>
In fact, John Paul II made his feelings clear when he made the true 
and loyal bishop of Shanghai -- Ignatius Kung -- a Prince of the 
Church. 
<p>
"With what prayerful longing and love do I follow the life of the 
loyal Chinese Catholic communities," the pope said, when he received 
Cardinal Kung in 1991. 
<p>
True -- the Patriotic bishops say they love the Holy Father, and 
respect him as the Successor of Peter. But, they don't believe that he 
has the authority to appoint bishops or to govern the Catholics in 
China. 
<p>
Cardinal Kung, now 94 and living in Connecticut, spent 30 years in a 
Communist prison. If he had been willing to renounce the authority of 
the pope, he would have been released and rewarded with a high 
position in the Patriotic Church. Others did -- like Bishop Jin of 
Shanghai, Bishop Fu Tieshan of Beijing, and Bishop Zong Huaide, the 
president of the Patriotic Association. But, Cardinal Kung would not. 
<p>
Today, the Communists continue to arrest members of the underground 
Church. Sadly, the state-connected Patriotic Church has yet to 
denounce the persecutions. 
<p>
The ranks of the loyal bishops arrested within the last few weeks 
include the 76-year-old Bishop Zeng Jingmu -- his second arrest since 
August -- as well as Bishop Han Dingxiang and Bishop Jia Zhiguo. All 
were later released, but the message was clear: don't give us trouble, 
or you'll be arrested again. 
<p>
Several underground priests, including a Jesuit, are currently serving 
prison terms. One was recently released, after being severely 
tortured. 
<p>
And, lay people have been imprisoned for attending an underground 
Mass. This past Easter, dozens were arrested and tortured. 
<p>
For an update on recent arrests, or for information on how to help the 
underground Catholic Church in China, contact the Cardinal Kung 
Foundation, P.O. Box 8086, Ridgeway Center, Stamford CT 06905. 
<p>
 With all its advantages, it would be reasonable to assume that the 
Patriotic Catholic Church has the most followers, wouldn't it? But, it 
doesn't work out that way. 
<p>
There are three million members of the Patriotic Church. Compared that 
to NINE million members of the underground Roman Catholic Church -- an 
increase of 300 percent since the beginning of the persecution in 
1949. 
<p>
Best of all, the true bishops of China continue to proclaim Church 
teachings joyfully, loudly and completely -- even though they know the 
only way to ensure their own safety is to stay silent. 
<p>
Sixty years ago, Catholic school children in America donated "pennies 
for China" to support the missions. 
<p>
Today, we have reaped a priceless reward for that almsgiving: an 
example of courage and faithfulness that could -- if it were more 
widely known -- be an inspiration for others to remain steadfast in 
the ancient Faith.

<html><head><title>Howley:  Pagans I Have Known</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg"><center><i>
 November 16, 1995</I><hr><h2>Pagans I Have Known</h2><br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"><b><i>Kathleen Howley</i></b></a><hr><br></center>  
 
The press pretty much ignored the 20th annual Women's Ordination 
Conference, held during the Veteran's Day weekend at a Marriott hotel 
near Washington D.C. 
<p>
Apparently, it's not newsworthy when 1,000 Catholic women -- more than 
half of them nuns from mainstream orders -- gather to denounce the 
teachings of their church, ridicule the pope, and voice avid support 
for lesbianism and abortion.  
<p>
Ho hum. Tell me something new. 
<p>
But, if the reporters and their cameras had been there, I'd be willing 
to bet that they wouldn't have focused on the over-the-edge, bizarre 
events of the conference, such as the Friday night opening ritual that 
included women dressed as bishops and priests, dancing on-stage to a 
rhythmic, sensual drum beat.  
<p>
Instead, they probably would have zoomed in on the mere handful of 
moments that corresponded with their idea of what these women are 
interested in: ordination and inclusive language. 
<p>
But, anyone who has spent five minutes around W.O.C. members knows 
better. Do you really think these women want to kneel at the feet of a 
"patriarchal" bishop to receive the Sacrament of Holy Orders?  
<p>
No way. First, they don't believe in Sacraments, as instituted by 
Christ and defined by the Catholic Church. For example, I've heard 
their leaders suggest, repeatedly, that several new Sacraments should 
be added to mark the stages of women's lives, such as the onset of 
wisdom, which supposedly happens when a woman reaches 50 -- they call 
it "croning." 
<p>
The "Sacrament of Croning." See what I mean?  
<p>
Secondly, they are adamant about their desire to dismantle the 
priesthood as we know it, and change the function of a priest into a 
non-sacramental facilitator who derives power from the community. 
<p>
 "Ordination means sub-ordination," was the mantra at the recent 
conference. They claim they want to "deconstruct" the priesthood. 
Meaning, they want to destroy it. 
<p>
And, inclusive language? They're definitely not interested in that. 
They demand that liturgical language be exclusively feminine. 
<p>
I've been to plenty of W.O.C. and Women-Church gatherings. The events 
always include prayers to the goddess, who, for the uninitiated, has 
three personalities -- maiden, mother, and crone -- each with various 
names. 
<p>
And, the conferences usually include bread-breaking rituals that 
resemble a Catholic Mass. 
<p>
At most of their rituals, the focal point is an altar with a statue of 
the goddess, usually with a candle burning in front of it.  
<p>
During the Saturday night "ritual meal" at the recent conference, 
there was no statue in sight, but the goddess personality of the 
moment was the ever-popular Sophia, a W.O.C. invention that twists the 
Scriptural meaning of "Sophia" -- recognized by Catholics as the 
virtue of wisdom, or as another name for the Holy Spirit -- and turns 
it into a pagan deity. 
<p>
That night, in the darkened banquet hall, one of the incantations 
sounded eerily like the Divine Praises: 
<p>
"Blessed be Sophia. Blessed be her holy name. Blessed be all women: 
young, generative and wise. Blessed be Sophia's sisters who keep alive 
the discipleship of equals. Blessed be all children who tell the 
stories of their foremothers...."  
<p>
It was chanted by all the attendees, following a bread-breaking 
ceremony. The only ones who didn't take part were a handful of 
faithful Catholics who were there as observers. 
<p>
Hours later, after the ritual meal was finished, and the attendees had 
moved on to another room for an all-women dance with cash bar, I spoke 
to one of the waitresses, who was clearing tables. 
<p>
"What did you think?" I asked her. 
<p>
"I'm a born-again Christian," she warily told me, in broken English, 
"so I really don't know about these Catholic things." 
<p>
"This was definitely not Catholic. It was pagan," I said, 
emphatically. 
<p>
She looked relieved to find out that I wasn't one of "them," and 
confided, in a low voice, "I felt the presence of evil here, tonight." 
<p>
"Me, too," I told her. 
<p>
Beyond the fact that every soul is precious in the eyes of the Father, 
why should the apostasy of W.O.C. followers interest us in the least? 
<p>
Because these are powerful women. They teach at Catholic universities 
and seminaries. They run Catholic high schools. They work in 
chancelleries and parishes. They design R.C.I.A. and C.C.D. programs. 
They run retreats and offer spiritual direction to unsuspecting 
Catholics. 
<p>
They don't want to leave the Church. They want to remake it, in their 
own image. 
<p>
And, it's rare to find one who doesn't have a string of graduate 
degrees after her name. The elderly members of their religious orders 
may live in fear of losing their health insurance as a result of a 
shrinking financial base, but these younger members, typically 50 to 
65 years old, have plenty of money to continue their education. 
<p>
In the battle for the soul of the Roman Catholic Church in America, 
these women are mighty adversaries, indeed.<p><p> <I>Copyright 1995, <a href="mailto:73360.271@compuserve.com">Kathleen Howley</a></i><P> <br><center><a href="/townhall/tbut.map"><img src="/townhall/tbut.gif" ismap border="0"></a></center></body></html>

<html><head><title>Howley: Divorce, Irish Style</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg"><center><i>
 November 28, 1995</I><hr><h2>Divorce, Irish Style</h2><br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"><b><i>Kathleen Howley</i></b></a><hr><br></center>  

Centuries of oppression couldn't stamp out the Catholic Church in 
Ireland. The deadlier the persecutions became, the more people clung 
to the Rock of Peter. 
<p>
A tragic famine that killed one out of every eight people in Ireland 
didn't shake their faith. Only a tiny fraction became "soupers," the 
name given to people who denied the faith in order to receive food 
from Protestant soup kitchens. 
<p>
Nor could dismal poverty, lasting for generations, make Irish people 
lose their hope in winning eternal life through fidelity to the 
teachings of the Church.  
<p>
But, a decade or two of secularization and materialism has managed to 
cripple the faith in Ireland quite easily, with hardly a voice raised 
in complaint. 
<p>
For proof of that, just look at their politics. 
<p>
In 1990, Ireland elected a left-wing, pro-choice lawyer, Mary 
Robinson, as president. In 1993, the government removed legal 
sanctions against homosexual activity, and made condoms freely 
available. 
<p>
And now, in a country that is more than 92 percent Catholic, divorce 
has been legalized -- albeit by a wafer-thin margin. 
<p>
In fact, the recent divorce referendum proved to be the closest vote 
in Irish history. A recount confirmed that only 9,114 "yes" votes 
provided the margin of victory for 1.6 million ballots cast. 
<p>
The Irish press lent a helping hand in defeating the pro-family 
forces, just as our own American press does for family issues on our 
side of the ocean. 
<p>
For example, Irish articles tended to describe those who opposed the 
legalization of divorce as blindly following the heavy-handed 
teachings of the oppressive Catholic Church. 
<p>
On the other hand, pro-divorce voters were not portrayed as mindlessly 
following the dictates of the liberal agenda -- like liberal Democrats 
in America, who all claim to be free-thinkers, yet, march lockstep on 
every issue.  
<p>
No -- articles tended to give the impression that supporting divorce 
qualified someone as being thoughtful and farseeing. 
<p>
And, the press employed their usual "reductio ad extremus" technique, 
giving big play to stories that profiled heartbreaking cases, to 
emphasize the tragic results of opposing liberal advances.  
<p>
Such as: the story of a young woman, abused and deserted by her 
husband, consigned to a life alone. In reality, that situation 
represents only a tiny fraction of the marriages in Ireland. 
<p>
Someday, the Irish will learn what many Americans have gleaned from 
watching the disintegration of our own society: Tough cases make bad 
laws. 
<p>
As it turned out, there were several deciding factors in the campaign 
to legalize divorce. The biggest was the $800,000 chunk of public 
money used by the government to fund a pro-divorce publicity drive. 
Shortly before the big vote, an Irish court ruled it was illegal to 
use tax revenues in that way. But, by then it was too late. Most of it 
was already spent. 
<p>
And, the pro-divorce movement was helped with cameo appearances by a 
host of Irish celebrities, such as Bono of U2, and Van Morrison. 
<p>
Another factor was the weakness of the Catholic Church, depleted by an 
endless array of sex sandals that began several years ago when the 
much-beloved bishop of Galway, Eamonn Casey, resigned after admitting 
he had fathered a child with an American woman. 
<p>
In the days before the vote, posters appeared on lampposts all over 
Dublin picturing Bishop Casey. The text stated: "Let the Bishops look 
after their own families ... VOTE YES." 
<p>
Fifteen years ago, no prominent Irish politician would have dared to 
support divorce. To do so would have meant mean electoral suicide. 
Yet, in the recent divorce campaign, every major party was pro-
divorce. 
<p>
What could have caused such a change in Irish society? The biggest 
impetus, many agree, has been the endless stream of soul-less 
television shows beamed into Irish homes over the last decade, most of 
it American-made. 
<p>
Last June, I was in Ireland, visiting my family. One afternoon, I 
stopped at a friend's farmhouse for tea, and while we chatted, she 
kept the television on in the background to entertain her four-year-
old daughter. 
<p>
Children in Ireland watch television just like American kids: soaking 
everything in with big eyes. 
<p>
It was an episode of "Murphy Brown" that portrayed Murphy and her 
lover having a tryst in a hotel room.  
<p>
My friend didn't mind that her daughter was exposed to such 
immorality. But, it was a shock to me, even though I was weaned on 
that kind of trash. 
<p>
What was once inconceivable in Ireland had become old hat. 
<p>
In times past, the Irish believed that marriages, even unhappy ones, 
lasted forever. They believed that adultery was a poison to a society. 
And, their laws reflected their beliefs.  
<p>
Today, they have set their sights on the liberal path that Americans 
blazed more than 20 years ago.  
<p>
It leads, as we know first-hand, to a place where broken families, 
violence and endless heartache are commonplace. 
<p>
Remember that lonely young woman, abused and abandoned by her husband? 
Currently, she represents just a handful of Irish women. But, you can 
bet that in a few decades, that sort of misery will be spread all over 
Ireland.

When the local Catholic priest trades his black suit and Roman collar 
for faded jeans and a T-shirt, and says to his flock, "Just call me 
Bob," what should you do? 
<P>
I suppose intercessory prayer should be your first response, but after 
that, you might think of picking up "Serpent On the Rock," a 1994 book 
by Alice Thomas Ellis, a native of Liverpool. 
<P>
It's a funny, faithful, and realistic view of what it means to be 
Catholic in the 1990s.  <P>

P.D. James, best-selling author of British murder mysteries, reviewed 
the book for the Times Literary Supplement, and described it as: "One 
woman's idiosyncratic, passionate and sometimes intemperate 
view...(It) should be compulsory reading for all bishops and placed in 
the library of all seminaries and theological colleges." <P>

But, most importantly, it will make you laugh. In fact, it's quite 
possible that while reading the book you will, on occasion, be 
convulsed by fits of uncontrollable laughter. I was. 
<P>
Ellis, the mother of seven children, traveled across Ireland and 
England, asking people what they thought about the current state of 
the Catholic Church.  <P>

 Ecumenism, liberation theology, liturgy, and feminism -- it's all 
there. <P>

She gives plenty of ink to Catholics who dissent from Church 
teachings. Then, she politely puts in a word or two of her own. 
<P>
She writes: "Visiting some people I had not seen for years I found 
again that smiling determination to deny that there is anything awry 
in the Church -- despite the fact that the Vatican and many 
theologians are seldom in accord and that there is laxity, confusion 
and an abundance of what used to be called heresy until it was decided 
that this was rude and everyone was entitled to his own opinion." 
<P>
Ellis, on church architecture: <P>

"If you visited a place where you knew the Catholic church had been 
recently constructed, you only had to ask for the most diabolically 
ugly building in town, bar none." 
<P>
On the interior decoration of churches: 
<P>
"It doesn't feel too different from McDonald's or the bank, and the 
local post office has got a new carpet, too. If I merely want to feel 
comfortable I go to the pub." 
<P>
On Confession: <P>
   "The church noticeboard advertised a 'Ceremony of Reconciliation' 
with the word 'Confession' in brackets. One day, bowed down under an 
awareness of my failings, I went to unburden my soul. Having conducted 
an examination of conscience I announced 'sub rosa' that, on 
reflection, I had to accuse myself of having fallen short in virtually 
every aspect of what was required of me: I was, to say the least, 
inadequate as a daughter, wife, mother and Catholic. Picture my 
astonishment on hearing my confessor suggest soothingly that he feared 
I was suffering from 'low self-esteem.'" 
<P>
On women priests:  
<P>
"I find something infinitely touching in the sight of males serving at 
the altar. A seriousness, a dignity and a humility which are not 
readily apparent in most of the other things they do. Women don't give 
the same impression. I saw some round the altar in New Zealand. They 
looked incongruous and bossy, very much as though they felt only they 
knew how to wash up properly." 
<P>
On sex: 
<P>
"I keep meeting women who insist on telling me how important their sex 
drive is to them. Once they might have announced they were regular 
church-goers; now they tell you they're sexually active. It's a sort 
of claim to credibility." 
<P>
On homosexuality: 
<P>
"Nor do I understand why so many people seem determined to define 
themselves by their sexual orientation. It seems unnecessarily 
limiting. When a person fixes you with a glance and says 'I'm 
gay/lesbian, you know,' you think: 'So what, darling? Just don't eat 
with your mouth open.'" 
<P>
On nuns:  
<P>
"One sometimes hears of women who are said to have been 'hurt' by the 
Church. I was thinking now of a new-style 'nun' who, finding herself 
at dinner sitting between two Jesuits, burst into tears because they 
spoke only to each other. She felt ignored and therefore diminished -- 
and fled, weeping. As a married women I am entirely accustomed to this 
kind of experience and do not mind it in the least. It gives you time 
to think your own thoughts, which are often more diverting than the 
conversations of men. Perhaps she would have felt more at ease in an 
old-fashioned convent where she would not have had to cope with the 
complexities of social intercourse between the sexes." 
<P>
Unfortunately, you might have a problem getting your hands on a copy 
of "Serpent on the Rock," published by Hodder and Stoughton, a British 
firm. So far, the book hasn't been distributed in America. 
<P>
Your local bookstore may be able to special-order it. If you have 
friends or relatives in Ireland or England, you could ask them, or 
even beg them, to send you a copy. Or, write directly to the publisher 
at: 338 Euston Rd., London NW1 3BH. 
<P>
It's worth the effort. If you're not one of the lucky Catholics in 
America who lives in a parish with a licit and reverential Mass, then 
you're probably long overdue for a dose of laughter, the best 
medicine.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick. Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
shares more of our annual Family Research Council's Washington Briefing. 
The 1996 briefing included nationally known speakers who informed FRC 
constituents about the most current and controversial events.  Key among 
the speakers were leading Senators and Congressmen detailing issues
affecting America's families.

<p>

The FRC Washington Briefing was also a wonderful reminder that the 
pro-family battle is not exclusively fought inside the beltway. Leaders 
from across our nation maintain the standards that ensure family values 
are not lost in today's societies. You will enjoy this exchange of 
national and front-line leaders in this briefing highlight.

<p>

But to begin, let's hear Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum's insight 
into what actually happens on the House and Senate floors.  For you 
C-SPAN junkies, the congressional voting process may seem routine, 
but for many the congressional language sounds foreign.  So Senator 
Rick Santorum provides a clear definition of that language and what 
changes need to be made so that our representatives can efficiently 
and effectively make positive decisions for American citizens.

<p>

To learn more, <i>Straight Talk</i> now takes you Behind the Headlines.

<p>

<p>

[Segment from 1996 Washington Briefing follows:]

<p>

SENATOR SANTORUM:  What makes the Senate slower than
the House?  It is called a filibuster.  I was in the House four
years; I have been in the Senate now a year and two months, although
it seems like I have been in the Senate four years, because we
just spend that much more time on the floor in debate and deliberation.

<p>

In the House, majority rules.  If you have 51 percent of the vote,
you can do anything you want in the House of Representatives,
anything.  You have something called a Rules Committee in the
House, which, every time a bill comes to the floor of the House,
there is a rule that comes with it that limits debate and limits
amendments.  If you want to offer an amendment on the floor of
the House, by and large, you have to get permission from the Rules
Committee to do so.  And if you don't get permission, you can't
offer the amendment.

<p>

So it is very much a majority-ruled and controlled
body.  The Rules Committee has nine Republicans and four Democrats.
So even if we lose one or two of our own, we still win.  So it
is very hard for the leader -- and the leader puts people who
are going to follow the leader on the Rules Committee.  So you
really have absolute control over it.

<p>

In the Senate, every bill that comes up, you can offer an amendment, 
whether it is germane or not germane.  We can be debating 
telecommunications, and we can have an amendment that deals with the 
Bosnian war; just no relevance at all.  And they can continue to offer 
it. Every day they can offer the same amendment.  Every bill that comes 
up, we can deal with the same amendment.  Many times we do deal with
a lot of the same.  Senator Wellstone has one of his favorite
amendments.  He offers it all the time.  We voted on it 10, 12
times.  But that can happen in the Senate.

<p>

Also, we have to have 60 votes to pass a bill.  Now, it only takes 51 
to pass, but to get to the passage, get to the vote on final passage, 
you usually have to break, at least in this Congress, we usually have 
to break a filibuster, which means we need 60 votes.  So we have to 
have 60 votes to get to passage, which really means you need 60 votes
to pass a bill, and you have this unlimited amendment which will
delay things for a long, long, long time.  So that is the problem.

<p>

The solution is actually a very simple solution, and that is get
60 Republican Senators.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Following this commercial break, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
presents more from the Family Research Council's
1996 Washington Briefing, as we hear how we can make a difference
in reforming our current welfare system.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>. At the 1996 Washington Briefing, Senator Dan
Coats spoke of hope and vision for truly impacting Americans who
are in need.  Let's hear how we can help transform lives and revive
our communities.

<p>

SENATOR COATS:  Something that has just been a passion of mine and 
something that I have been working on for nearly a decade is an issue 
that addresses not necessarily the political side of the question but 
the moral and spiritual side of the question.

<p>

I am encouraged from the standpoint that America today is talking 
about not only the failure of big government to address our problems 
but beginning to seriously examine the moral and spiritual and 
cultural decline that is taking place in this nation and beginning 
to ask questions about how we can revive the role of the family, 
the role of the church, the role of the spiritual involvement and 
values in terms of education, in terms of who we are as a people.

<p>

We are beginning to read in what normally would be considered liberal 
publications, we are beginning to hear from people who normally would 
be labeled as coming more from the liberal side, that the failure of 
the secular approach, the big government approach, must lead us to an 
examination of whether or not we can identify other successful 
approaches; and I am encouraged that that debate has begun.

<p>

Ten years ago, as the Republican leader of the Children, Youth, and 
Families Committee in the House of Representatives, I began, along with
some others, to look at the role of the government in addressing
some of these fundamental needs that exist in our society today.

<p>

That committee, in its first year of existence, traveled around
the country attempting to elicit from individuals speaking before
our panel identification of the problem and solutions to the problem.
And everywhere we went, it seemed that no matter who came before
us to propose the solutions, the bottom line of what they proposed
was more of the same.  &quot;Oh, this program could be effective
if we had some more funds to enlarge it, to broaden it, to reach
out.  No, we don't have positive statistics to give you right
now in terms of outcome, but if we could put more money into the
program, if we could put more effort -- and, by the way, we don't
have the money here, so you need to send it from Washington&quot;
-- everywhere we went in the country, no matter whom we talked
to -- rural, suburban, inner city, or whatever -- all the experts
came before us and said more of the same.

<p>

It was at one of our last hearings in Macon, Georgia, on the subject 
of the rural southern youth and the problems that they were 
experiencing, that the very last panelist to appear before our 
committee before we rushed back to Atlanta to get on a plane to come 
back to Washington was a humble black minister from the Macedonian 
Missionary Church of Waycross, Georgia.  I don't know how he got on 
the panel. I don't know who invited him.  I didn't know why he was 
there.

<p>

Rev. McKinney, as some of the members and staff were starting
to pack up their papers to get ready to go back to Atlanta, presented
some of the most eloquent testimony that hit the nail right on
the head.  He looked at us and said, &quot;I've been listening
all day, and what you Congressmen and women don't seem to understand
is that the problems that I have to deal with with the youth of
my area, mostly low income, mostly black, that's true,&quot; he
said, &quot;but the problems I deal with are the same as the problems
everywhere.&quot;

<p>

He said, &quot;Those problems don't just result
from a lack of good housing, from a lack of good programs, from
a lack of schools, lack of education.&quot;  He said, &quot;Those
problems go deeper than that.  What you Congressmen don't seem
to understand is that if we want to heal individuals, we have
to touch the whole person.&quot;  He said, &quot;Government can't
do that.  You see,&quot; he said, &quot;all of us are made up
of not just body and mind but soul and spirit, and if we can't
redeem and heal soul and spirit, no matter how much money you
pour into programs, no matter how many bureaucracies you establish,
no matter how many programs you send to us,&quot; he said, &quot;all
the money in the world will not solve the problems of these people,
because we have to heal their soul and spirit as well as address
the problems of body and mind.&quot;

<p>

He said, &quot;These young girls that come to me with child, no 
father taking responsibility,&quot; he said, &quot;they're looking 
for something to love.  They are looking for something that is much 
deeper than can be solved by a government program.  And these young 
black boys that come that have been fathering kids all over the 
community, they're looking for something to prove that they are a 
man.&quot;

<p>

He said, &quot;That is why you must begin to examine how we can utilize 
the role of the church, the role of the family, the role of charity and 
private organizations outside of government which can bring these 
spiritual values to bear on a spiritual problem.&quot;

<p>

From that point forward, I began the process of attempting to identify 
ways in which the government could shift its emphasis from government 
programs which can't address soul and spirit to programs that can address 
soul and spirit.  I realize that you have to get beyond government.
We have to find a way to utilize institutions that are not government
institutions so that those institutions can bring to bear the
spiritual content and effort that can truly make a difference
in lives that are hurting, that can reclaim lives and redeem lives.

<p>

I have examined programs across the country that are reaching
out and solving intractable problems by injecting a spiritual
renewal and a vision of hope and redemption in the people that
they reach out to.

<p>

All of that led to the culmination and development
of a program called Project for American Renewal that I have worked
on intensely for the past year and a half, pulling together a
number of ways in which the government can begin the process of
shifting from the public sector to the private sector, ways which
do not violate the Constitution in terms of government involvement,
but energizing those organizations and those entities, those institutions
that can truly reclaim our communities, pull families back together,
reclaim lives, and bring spiritual and moral values to the programs
that they engage in.

<p>

Heart and soul of it all, though, is a charity
tax credit which allows every taxpayer in America to make a choice.
You can send up to $1,000 of your taxes that are due to the Federal
Government, or if you have more confidence in your local church
program or your local charity or your local faith-based organization,
you can designate that $1,000 to that organization and offset
it against those taxes due.

<p>

The bottom line: provide a hope and a vision for renewal of American 
society, for bringing families back together, for reuniting communities, 
for involving faith-based charities and involving the church in ways 
that provide redeeming, life-transforming, real help to people that 
are in need.

<p>

I think our party needs that vision.  I think we need to 
stand for more than just simply more of the same.  We don't know what 
to do except pour more money into the Washington institutions or simply 
wash our hands of the problem and say, &quot;Well, we just hope it
works itself out.  Government can't do it, but we don't know who
can.&quot;

<p>

We know who can.  We know who brings the hope of change,
the hope of redemption, the hope that touches soul and spirit
as well as body and mind.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Please join us after the commercial break as <i>Straight 
Talk</i> continues our 1996 Family Research Council Washington Briefing 
highlights.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>.

<p>

Washington State has a lot to be proud of in electing Congresswoman 
Linda Smith.  As a freshman, she has taken an extremely unpopular 
stance on making radical but, many believe, needed changes to 
government as we know it.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE SMITH: In this envelope are all the invitations of the 
nighttime events I could go to.  I can go to a Rock the House if I am 
a lobbyist and want to pay $500.  And I can go to a California Fiesta.
This is just the events I could go to each night from about 5
to 10 o'clock instead of reading the bills.

<p>

So when I got here and I got these, I go, &quot;Now, ooh, I didn't 
bargain for that.&quot; Of course, as a two-week write-in candidate, 
I didn't bargain for much of anything.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

I am not a Republican first, though. I know where my source is. And 
so when I got to Congress as a write-in candidate, I looked at the 
place, I looked at those invitations that I got each night, and I 
couldn't do it.

<p>

The first invitation, I looked and here were the names of the 
committees on it, and at the bottom it said, &quot;PACs, $500.&quot; 
I picked up the next one.  It said, &quot;PACs, $1,000.&quot;  And 
then I went into training, and I found out I was expected to spend
three to five nights a week, three to five hours a night, going
to these events to raise money for my colleagues, and they would
do it for me, and the invitations were sent to the PACs and special-interest
groups that surround this place.

<p>

I decided I wouldn't do it for a very functional reason.  I didn't have 
three to five hours a day.  I hadn't run.  God had put me here.  Some 
people have spent two years, but I spent two weeks. And while I was 
here, I was going to get the job done, really kind of basic stuff.

<p>

But I went to a couple of receptions, and I realized not only could I 
not do that; I couldn't go.  Now, I am not holier than thou.  I have
run a corporation; I have been in the business community for years;
I have been in politics.  I am not a neophyte to this.  But the
first time one of the lobbyists came up to me and leaned towards
me and said, &quot;I was a friend in your last election,&quot;
I realized we had two languages, the language out in the real
world and here.

<p>

What that means is he had given me money into
my election, and he went right on to say, after he said, &quot;I
was a friend in your last election&quot; -- that means I gave
you a contribution; that's the translation -- he went on to tell
me what they wanted that was right on the floor right then. And
I go, &quot;Oh, this is really close.&quot;

<p>

Then I realized that what was happening is there are fund-raisers all 
around every night, Democrat and Republican, probably a dozen or more 
every night.  That's where the lobbyists go.  They pay to get in, $500
to $1,000, for members for their war chests -- that means money
you accumulate from special interests to make sure nobody runs
against you -- and that that was just an atmosphere where they
could come and find a certain number of members every night to
lobby the bill on the floor.  We were in session just about every
night, and we ran back and forth between these events and voted
and went back and forth.

<p>

I watched what was happening to these families, and I am not saying 
that they are all breaking up, but it will be amazing if they don't. 
Here was dad at these receptions every night, or mom, mostly dads, 
three to five nights a week, with everyone telling you you're wonderful 
-- of course, they want something -- giving you money, and then these 
families were having to figure out how to get home on the weekends, and 
if they got home on the weekends, how they were spreading their time 
between their family and their district, or moving their family here and
then having to choose between the district or the family here.
Bad situation.

<p>

I looked at this and thought, Now, why did God
put me here?  I don't believe God makes mistakes.  I was so overwhelmed
by it, and I don't mean losing control, I mean just I can't believe
this place operates this way.  I started looking and going, &quot;Why?
Why, with good people coming here, does it happen?&quot;

<p>

This is the way it happens, and I figured it out.  It's a trap.  Good
people get here.  They stay good, but they have to harden a little
bit to stay in it.  Now, some folks say, &quot;That's not fair,
Linda; it doesn't affect me.&quot;  I'll give them that.  Maybe
a few people it doesn't affect. But as soon as they get here,
this is what happens.  They arrange one of those events for you.
On it they put the committees that you are on; in fact, they
put the freshmen on key committees to raise money.  They then
call on the name of the chair and the committee, and they will
do this if you're a lobbyist, and they have your staff doing it
at night, and you pay people to do it, and volunteers do it.

<p>

Let's say that you're a lobbyist.  They will call you and they will
say, &quot;Hi.  I'm calling tonight.  I didn't see your name on
Linda Smith's event tomorrow night,&quot; the fiesta, California
Fiesta or whatever.  They make it sound like a party.  Who pays
$500 to go to that kind of party?  And then they pause.  I mean,
it is all scripted.  &quot;Well, are you coming?&quot;  They say
something about being busy.  &quot;Well, have you sent your check?&quot;

<p>

Now, this is just the way it goes, and not occasionally; that
is the scripting.  Tell me it's not affecting this place.  It
is affecting this place.  And even if you somehow in your heart
can feel it doesn't affect you, it does affect this place.

<p>

So when I decided that we couldn't do that, I started accumulating
all the invitations, and I realized that the committees are on
all of them.  The chairmen of the committees support you on them,
and you have four, and if you have four, you are going to need
to go to several hundred.  If you go to several hundred, how do
you get your work done?  How do you see your family?

<p>

So what we are calling for is a bill that basically terminates the 
flow of money here.  I want to tell you, it is not a partisan thing.
It is not a Democrat thing.  They built the system up real good.
And it's not a Republican thing.  We got the system.  But it
is a system that I don't believe will allow us to balance the
budget.

<p>

I have watched each appropriation bill come to the floor,
one by one, and I have watched the fight over such things as the
National Endowment for the Arts.  Now, even if you support the
National Endowment for the Arts, should it be added to our debt
each year, being that we are spending 20 percent more than is
coming in every year?  It would make sense that would go first,
wouldn't it?

<p>

What about the tobacco subsidy?  Some of these things
make sense they would go first, wouldn't they?  Do you know that
we couldn't take them out?  Now let's go to sugar subsidy, let's
go to tobacco subsidy, peanut subsidy. But they contribute a whale
of a lot of money around here.

<p>

Now, most people would say, &quot;They only support us because we 
are philosophically with them.&quot; Well, they were philosophically 
with the Democrats last year, then, because most of the groups gave 
two to one to the Democrats, and as soon as we took control, now they 
give two to one to the Republicans.  It is amazing how they philosophically 
shifted all in one year, isn't it?

<p>

Now, the big problem is right now we didn't build it, it isn't our 
fault, but we're in it.  So you're asking a lot of people to change a 
system in the middle of a war.  It would be like asking our freshmen to 
lay down their arms in the middle of a war when their opponents are coming 
in here and raising money, because this is a war for this century. I mean, 
this is going to be whether or not we change America.

<p>

So you have the freshman Republicans, especially, coming in and saying 
we're going to clean up the system, but they are terrified of not having 
enough money with a Democrat coming up against them, and it is mostly
that direction.

<p>

So here they are.  They look like a hypocrite if they stay in the 
system and talk against it, if they use it, but they know they're 
going to be got.

<p>

Now, I have a belief. It is called a Daniel standard, and that is 
what frustrates people. Once I get to the point where I believe it's 
wrong, I don't care where God sends me, I am going to go into that land 
and I am going to follow that standard.  Daniel went in and he didn't 
eat off the table.  But what did he do?  He trusted in God for his 
provision.

<p>

Now, what we would do here is, we come in, we have a choice.
Do we follow the way of this place, pretend it doesn't affect
us -- and maybe some people it doesn't -- or do we say, &quot;I'm
not going to do it.&quot;  I don't believe everyone is called
to the same standard.  I believe they are called to right as God
shows them, but sometimes He will show you right a little before
me because He is working on me somewhere else.  I believe it is
wrong to the point where I cannot hold fund-raisers here.  I can't
do it.  You only start believing you can do it when you get here.
The real world out there doesn't think it's the right thing to
do normally.

<p>

What we're doing with the measure that I am trying
to pass is just saying, let's change the system.  I am not even
asking that we change it in the middle of this war.  I am not
asking for a Daniel standard.  All I am saying is let's vote now
and not send any more freshmen into the system, not have them
have to look you in the eye and say, &quot;Yes, I took $10,000
from the tobacco lobby, but it didn't make any difference.&quot;
That is a horrible thing.

<p>

We are just saying, at the end of this year, change it. Change the 
system.  And then, I believe, when we come back, people are going to 
trust us to make those tough decisions.  But right now they look at it 
and it is all muddled, and they go, &quot;How can we trust people when 
this is happening?&quot;

<p>

We could lose our system, I believe, by the 
lack of trust in it and what we are doing here.  I believe it is a fight 
for the Democratic system, and I think it is also a fight for whether we 
have a balanced budget, because you remember all those balanced budget 
things, they are seven years long, at least.  But every year the 
lobbyists around this place -- not bad people; they would probably like
to go home to their families, too -- every year, the special interests
grow.  There are 14,000 lobbyists.

<p>

Do you really think -- and I will leave you with this -- that by the 
end of the seven years, we can really balance the budget, with the 
amount of special-interest money that flows to this place?  I don't. For 
me to keep my word to my district to go in and balance the budget and to 
clean the system up, I have to do what I'm doing.  I don't have any 
choice.

<p>

So you will see me standing and saying, &quot;If the Republicans
are doing it, they are wrong.  If the Democrats are doing it,
they are wrong.&quot;  The situation does not dictate that this
is right because the Republicans are in control.  And in fact,
because I think God raised us up in a different way, a lot of
us miraculously, we have a greater responsibility.  People are
looking to us and saying, &quot;Is this Congress going to be different?
Is it going to be different than the old one that built a shroud
of protection around itself and became elite, or are they going
to be really a Congress of the people?&quot;  And I believe that
we have a much greater chance of preserving this democracy if
we are a Congress of the people, but I know we have to follow
God's word.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we'll share
more of the 1996 Washington Briefing as we hear from well-known
columnist and commentator Robert Novak.  You won't want to miss.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. Robert Novak can often
be seen on CNN's <i>Capital Gang</i> and <i>Crossfire</i>, and one 
guarantee from Mr. Novak: he's not shy when it comes to voicing his 
opinions, which he shared at the 1996 FRC Washington Briefing.

<p>

MR. NOVAK: As I go around the country, Republicans are dispirited. 
One year after they were in ecstacy, conservatives are worried.  How
did that happen?  How did it happen?  In fact, in a time when
I think the world is getting more and more conservative, when
the efficacy of government and the reliance on politics is declining
in every corner of the world, we have what is the most liberal
President we have ever had in the United States.

<p>

How did Bill Clinton get elected in the first place?  Well, we had a 
three-way race and President Bush broke his word on taxes.  And something
else.  There was something positive that President Clinton did.
Bill Clinton and his running mate went around the country, two
bubbas on a bus, telling people that they were a new kind of Democrats;
they didn't believe in too much government, too much taxation.
They were populists.

<p>

You know, I got a kick out of Al Gore calling
himself a populist.  I have known Al Gore since he was 12 years
old.  How did I know him when he was 12 years old?  Well, his
daddy, Albert Gore, Sr., was a U.S. Senator when I covered the
Senate for the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> a long time ago.  I was pleased
to be a guest in their home.  They lived, they had an apartment
in the Fairfax Hotel, where little Al grew up.  The Fairfax Hotel
was partially owned by the Gore family, and today the Fairfax
Hotel, if you want to go looking for it to see a historic site,
is the Ritz Carlton Hotel.  And, you know, ladies and gentlemen,
there are very, very few populists who grow up in the Ritz Carlton
Hotel.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

Little Al went on to St. Alban's, which is the fanciest prep school 
in Washington, and from there he went to Harvard, where I am told he 
studied Southern as a foreign language.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

Now, Bill Clinton didn't need to develop his southern
accent.  But populist?  Georgetown School of Foreign Service,
then to Oxford, Rhodes Scholar, back to Yale Law School, where
he met Hillary Rodham; and together they went to Texas, where
they ran the McGovern for President campaign in Texas, which was
one of the 49 states that George McGovern failed to carry for
President in 1972.

<p>

After that they got married, went to Arkansas,
and Bill ran for Congress, was defeated; ran for state attorney
general, was elected; ran for governor, was elected; defeated
for reelection the first time out, then came back and won three
terms as governor; and then, first crack out of the box, ran for
President and was elected.  Very unusual to do it the first time,
the point being that President Clinton has spent almost his entire
life either running for office or serving in office, and in fact,
most of the people in his administration, contrary to all the
evidence of the 20th century, believe that government is the solution
and not the problem.  This is -- and I have been through the New
Frontier, the Great Society, Jimmy Carter -- he didn't have a
name, thank goodness -- and this is the most liberal administration,
by far.

<p>

Our newsletter which we are writing this week, we have
done a state-by-state analysis on what would happen if the election
were held today.  You know, there is a kind of euphoria among
Republicans.  They think that even though they are behind in the
popular vote, they are going to win the electoral vote.  It doesn't
happen, friends.  If the election were held today, President Clinton
would win by an electoral vote majority of -- we haven't done
the final numbers, but I think it is going to be about 130 votes
in the Electoral College.

<p>

Now, does that mean that it's over; we can go home?  Would that I 
wouldn't have to suffer through this eight-month campaign.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

But, no, there's a lot of pitfalls for the President.  Pitfall number 
one is Bosnia. Yes, there are 40,000 troops in Bosnia.  The bad news 
in Bosnia is that the snow is melting, the weather is spring, and maybe
these Balkan lunatics are going to start killing each other again
and our troops will get in the way.  I pray that that doesn't
happen, and I know you all pray that, too.

<p>

But, politically, there is very little margin of error for the President. 
He wants to get these troops out quick.  Let the Muslims and the Serbs
and the Croats start killing each other again.  Nothing is going
to be solved by our being there.  But let's get them out, because
the American people didn't want them there in the first place;
they still don't want them there in the first place; and Congress
didn't want them there in the first place, but they succumbed.

<p>

The second pitfall is Whitewater.  Whitewater won't go away. 
A lot of the sophisticated people in this town say Whitewater
is not important.  I have a lot of Republicans, even, who believe
that.  All of you should read a book called <i>Blood Sport</i> by Jim
Stewart, Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter, definitely,
definitely not a conservative.

<p>

Mr. Stewart, not a Washington reporter,
not a political reporter, was approached by a friend of his, Susan
Thomases, the First Lady's right-hand woman -- or should I say
left-hand woman -- asked if he could write, they would give him
access, and could he write a book on Whitewater, meaning it would
be an exculpatory book.  He got interested. They didn't give him
the cooperation that was promised, but he has written a hell of
a book.

<p>

Just today I talked to a former U.S. attorney who, going
through the book, jotting down things, found eight violations
of statutes, criminal violations, felonies.  Will the First Lady
be the first First Lady to be indicted, or even to be an unindicted
co-conspirator?  No wonder they want to end the D'Amato hearings,
put a stop to this.

<p>

The third pitfall is the economy:  0.9 percent
growth in the last quarter.  The first two quarters of this year
are going to be low growth, no growth, or negative growth.  The
economy is weak.  And the interesting thing is, as Pat Buchanan
has understood, it is weakest on the people who are in the Democratic
voting base.  Republicans are doing pretty well.  Will it get
weak enough so that it turns against the President?  No President,
when there has been a perception of an economic downturn, has
ever been reelected.

<p>

And the fourth pitfall is what the American
people think of Bill Clinton.  There is the question of whether
the American people really do want Bill Clinton in the White House
for four more years.  The Republicans have disappointed them,
I think.  I don't think they see in Senator Dole a visionary leader.
But sometimes they will say, perhaps, with all their shortcomings,
the opposition is better.  Perhaps the American people will take
a look at the issues:  Do I want more government or less?  Who
do I think is best equipped to have a social revival in this country?
And is government the problem or the solution?  That is what
is going to make this, despite everything else, an interesting
campaign.

<p>

Thank you very much.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shares insight from 
Family Research Council president Gary Bauer.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i>. FRC president Gary Bauer is known in Washington and
across the nation for standing firm when it comes to fighting
for America's families.  Let's hear his insight on tonight's Homefront
News.

<p>

<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>

<p>

MR. BAUER: One of the central things that sort of drives what we are 
doing at FRC is the fact that for about 15 years now, all of the polling 
data has been showing that two-thirds of the American people think
that America is headed in the wrong direction.

<p>

What could be on their minds?  Why are they so filled with anxiety? Now, 
I suspect some of it is economic. There hasn't been real wage growth for
a large segment of the population for about 20 years.  There is
a great deal of concern about downsizing and all the issues in
the headlines.

<p>

But I don't really think, at the end of the day,
that it is a essentially economics that are driving the answer
to that question.  I think Americans are pondering the heart and
soul of America, and it is that which is troubling them about
the future, the sense that I think we all have that America is
one wrong turn away from a disaster.

<p>

Every place I go, people say to me, &quot;What in the world happened to 
us?  How did we get here?  When did these things take place?  How did it 
all just sort of transpire that we woke up one morning and this was where
we were living?&quot;

<p>

I think, clearly, one answer to this question
of how we got here is that, as a society, we have collectively
forgotten God.  I mean, there is just no doubt about that in my
mind.  Now, that is a very impolitic thing to say in Washington,
D.C.  If you go up to a congressional committee or before some
reporter and you say, &quot;You know, the reason we're in this
mess is because we've forgotten God,&quot; that's a pretty unusual
thing for someone to say in Washington, even today.

<p>

But it's clear. I mean, isn't it clear to you all that that is at the 
core of the problem?  This is a terribly ironic thing that has happened
in the United States.  All over this city -- you've passed them
probably in the bus and when you've been walking around in the
last day and a half - there are monuments in this city where there
are words etched in the stone that make it clear that our liberty
comes from no man but from God.  Those monuments reflect the founding
of America.

<p>

Lincoln called us the almost chosen people, and he
called us that for a reason.  Every one of us have, either in
our pockets, or you ladies, in your purses, money that says, &quot;In
God We Trust,&quot; and the phrase has become as devalued as the
money it is printed on.

<p>

Now, to listen to the cultural elite in
this city, you would think that the biggest problem facing America
is that men and women like you, men and women of faith, may actually
get into the public square, plant your feet, and not move until
you have changed the country.

<p>

I would hope you would remember that the biggest threat facing 
America is that you will not do that.  You are the only ones that 
can explain to the American people the importance of the family to 
civilization. Nobody else is going to do it.  You are the only ones who 
can make the case for racial reconciliation, because you know we are 
all created equal by God, that we are equal in His sight, and that is the
foundation upon which a society gives equality to all people regardless
of their race or their creed or their economic background.

<p>

You are the only ones that can do that.  You are the only ones that
can explain, ultimately, the sanctity of human life and why life
can't just be put up to a vote every couple of years depending
on changing mores.  If you don't get into the public square, plant
your feet, and stand for these things, I am absolutely convinced
that America will fall in the next century as surely as it would
from economic collapse.

<p>

What's the second reason that we've gotten
into the mess we're in today?  I think the second reason is our
failure as a culture to teach our children who we are, what this
experiment was all about.  The research on this is absolutely
clear.  Each generation of young Americans knows less about their
heritage, about who they are, about the shoulders of the giants
upon whom they sit as Americans than the generation before it.

<p>

Now, the trend line here is clear.  A country for whom its children
are forgetting the basics or are never taught the basics is a
country in trouble.

<p>

I would like to suggest to you tonight that
we are not going to reform American education in the next year,
the next five years, or the next ten years, so we are going to
have to take it upon ourselves to make sure that our children
know the minutes of the last meeting, that they know about the
values that the country was built upon.

<p>

We have to teach our children who said, &quot;Give me liberty or 
give me death&quot; and who said, &quot;I have a dream.&quot; We need 
to teach them about what happened at Normandy, what happened at 
Concord Bridge, what happened on Pork Chop Hill, and how their liberty 
was born and nurtured in those places. We need to show them what 
Constitution Hall looks like, what good music sounds like, what the 
lady in New York Harbor stands for, why there was a Berlin Wall and what
the forces were that brought that wall down.

<p>

We need to teach them about Ruth and Naomi, Jonathan and David. In short, 
it is up to us to teach them to love the things we love and to honor
the things we honor, because nothing less than that will do.

<p>

Finally, I think the third thing that has happened is that we are in 
the process in America of separating virtue from liberty.  If we 
separate virtue from liberty, which is what the society in this 
culture is doing today, then the consequences are inevitable.

<p>

I think I have talked to some of you before about the absolutely 
incredible reaction to the death of Jerry Garcia, the lead singer of 
the band, the Grateful Dead.  But the thing that astonished me was,
here's Jerry Garcia that never got out of the sixties.  The man
was a dope addict and an alcoholic his entire life.  And yet when
he died last year, the culture treated his death as if a great
hero had passed from the scene.  It was one of the lead items
on all the evening news.  I watched United States Senators leave
committee hearing rooms to go out into the hallways and speak
to banks of cameras to say how much their lives had been touched
by Jerry Garcia.

<p>

There is something wrong, ladies and gentlemen,
when people like Jerry Garcia are held up as great heroes and
yet one-half of American 16-year-olds cannot tell you the correct
half-century the American Civil War took place. That's a problem.

<p>

And I suppose that there is no issue that is a clearer example
of the separation of virtue from liberty than the issue you have
heard about time and time again in the last day and a half, and
that is the sanctity of human life.  I mean, this is the marker
issue.  I suspect that there are probably some of you who would
maybe prefer that we not harp on it so much.  We can't stop harping
on it.

<p>

I believe it defines who we are as a country, and if we
ever rolled back abortion on demand, almost every other issue
we were dealing with, I think, would fall into place in a very
short period of time.  This issue is at the core of what our liberty
means and the role that virtue plays in moderating that liberty.

<p>

And so this organization, the Family Research Council, will
never back off on the abortion issue.  Men and women like you
who bring new life into the world, who stand for these values,
who will do anything for blood of their blood, flesh of their
flesh, that is courage, and that is what the Family Research Council
will stand for as long as I am here and this great staff that
you have met is here, and with your help.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick. Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
discusses a critical issue which is sweeping our country, making 
headlines nationwide, and causing a stir in American families:  the 
possible redefining of marriage to include homosexual unions.

<p>

We will be talking to Robert Knight of the Family Research Council, 
who has thoroughly researched the homosexual activist movement and their 
attempts to dramatically change family life as we know it. And we will
also bring you Anthony Falzarano, who, as a former homosexual,
knows well the inside story on homosexual culture and the attempts
to increase its influence by changing our laws.  These attempts
to redefine marriage will affect all of us, from the filing of
our taxes to our schools, to our workplaces, and beyond.  You
need to understand this phenomenon.

<p>

But first, let's hear from the Family Research Council's president, 
Gary Bauer.  Yesterday, Gary and I talked about a pivotal decision which 
may be made this very evening by President Clinton, whether to veto the 
Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act or to align himself with the majority of
Americans and majority of House and Senate members, who have clearly
stated that they strongly support the lifesaving act.

<p>

You will hear a lot of stories on this veto, but first, <i>Straight 
Talk</i> will take you Behind the Headlines.

<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gary, thanks so much for being with us today.

<p>

Just last week, on Good Friday, the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act
was finally sent to the President.  It was passed overwhelmingly
in both the House and the Senate.  It is a piece of legislation
that deals with a procedure in which the child is delivered into
the birth canal; moments from birth, a scissors stabbed into the
base of his skull; living brain tissue suctioned out; and this
is an abortion procedure that would be banned except to save the
life of the mother.

<p>

The President has been very clear that he intends to veto this bill. 
What do you think this says about the state of the abortion debate 
today?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  We probably should have given a disclaimer to the viewer 
who might not have wanted to hear that description.  It's incredible 
to think that in America we are actually aborting babies in the 
seventh, eighth, and ninth month of pregnancy using that procedure.

<p>

The country is deeply divided over abortion.  We all know that, Kristi. 
But every poll that I have seen shows that the American people 
overwhelmingly find this procedure to be reprehensible, to be grotesque; 
in fact, most Americans react in disbelief when they hear that it is 
something that goes on in clinics today.

<p>

So, for me, to hear the President of the United States say basically 
that he is going to fall on his sword over this; that he is so committed 
to abortion on demand that even these third-trimester abortions will 
continue under his Presidency is something that, in my mind, makes him 
an extremist on this issue.  I just don't know any other way to describe 
it. And it just seems sort of unusual, because he has really tried
in the last year or so to picture himself as being middle-of-the-road,
and I think he has been quite convincing with some Americans.

<p>

But here is an issue that gets past the rhetoric, goes right to
the heart of the debate in America about our liberty and how it
should be used, and the President has made it clear he is going
to stand with the National Organization for Women and the radicals
on this issue, and I think it is going to hurt him politically.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  One of the interesting things about this particular
abortion debate was that people who had never cast a pro-life
vote in their entire history voted for this particular ban.  What
do you think this says about the President's statement and his
advisors' statements that this particular abortion bill will work
for him?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, I don't know.  You know, the White
House does polling every night.  It is the first White House in
American history to do that, so you would expect them to have
a finely tuned sense of American public opinion.  I can't imagine
how in the world this issue would work for him, and quite frankly,
on an issue involving life and death, I would hope politicians
of all stripes would stop looking at these issues about what helps
them and what hurts them and start making judgments that are filled
with some sense of compassion and some sense of the sanctity of
life.  It just seems amazing to me that anyone would try to make
a political calculation over something this important.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Now, this bill does deal with the life-of-the-mother 
exception. If this procedure would be needed to save the mother's 
life, it would be available, but not for some of the other reasons,
not for elective abortion, for example.

<p>

This is the first time since <i>Roe v. Wade</i> that any abortion 
restriction at all has been made possible.  Why do you think that 
there has been a kind of restriction available now?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, you know, when you really think about it, people say 
that we have been debating abortion too much. Actually, we really 
don't as a society get to debate it really at all in any meaningful 
sense of the word.  The courts have driven this issue for over 20 
years, and no matter where you stand on the issue, the courts have had 
the trump cards. They keep throwing down their aces and stopping the 
American people from doing much about abortion one way or the other. 

<p>

This was the first time in a long, long time that the Congress of the 
United States actually had a real bill dealing with a real abortion 
issue that they had to debate and then vote on the record about.  I
think that is the important thing here.  These politicians in
the Congress knew that the whole country would see their vote
and would be able to ponder the meaning of those votes, and I
think that is why the final vote was so overwhelming.

<p>

Every once in a while, I tune in to C-SPAN that often will allow 
callers to comment on what is going on on the floor of the Congress, 
and what struck me was the just almost endless numbers of calls coming
in from people who would say, &quot;I'm pro-choice, but I can't
possibly support something like this.&quot;

<p>

So I think that is why this vote was so significant, and I think it 
reflects where the American people are on the abortion issue.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gary, you pointed out to me a poll out just this week 
which indicates that the majority of Americans in fact are actually 
pro-life or leaning toward pro-life.  What do the numbers tell us 
about people's sentiments toward abortions?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Yes, this is an area where there is great misunderstanding. 
The media generally says almost without question that Americans are 
&quot;pro-choice,&quot; which generally is interpreted to mean they 
favor abortion on demand.

<p>

What the polling data has shown for over 25 years and continues to 
show in 1996 is that about one-third of the country believes that 
abortion should be unrestricted totally. The other two-thirds of 
the country either wants abortion severely restricted
or doesn't want any abortions at all.  So to the extent that there
is a consensus in America, it is much more toward the pro-life
side.

<p>

Now, people get confused about what words like &quot;pro-choice&quot;
mean. That's why I always look at polls that get very specific:
Would you be in favor of abortion in this case or that case?
And when you ask that kind of question, it is clear that Americans,
two to one, take a generally pro-life position.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: This particular debate has been surrounded by a lot of 
powerful symbolism, first-time symbolism.  For example, the leaders of
the Catholic Church in America met in the park outside the White
House in pouring rain to pray and to ask the President not to
veto this particular bill.

<p>

Politically speaking, how do you think American Catholics will 
respond to a veto of the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, I think that what happened outside the White 
House just a few days ago was an incredible moral statement by the 
church that on this issue they would stand up to the President, 
even though they have some issues that they are in agreement with 
him on.

<p>

I think the interesting thing will be what will the average American 
Catholic -- and, for that matter, the average American evangelical -- 
do when they go to the voting booth in November on this kind of issue. 
There are a lot of issues that voters weigh, but presumably, men and 
women of faith are going to weigh issues that go directly to their 
faith first and foremost when they vote.

<p>

And so I think the President does run the risk of losing a lot of 
evangelical and Catholic votes if he follows through with his threat 
to veto this bill.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Do you think, Gary, that President Clinton will veto 
this bill, or is it possible that he might change his mind?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, I think that the signals over the last couple of weeks 
have been so clear and so pronounced that he almost would look foolish 
at this point. He really has backed himself into a corner.

<p>

The other thing is, there are some very important groups that the 
President has to have the support of, some of the radical feminist 
groups, groups like Planned Parenthood, the National Organization for
Women, and so forth.  These groups are important parts of the
liberal coalition in the United States, and I think the President
is afraid that if he vetoes the bill, he will get criticism from
groups he is going to be counting on.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The pro-life story can be put up against the Unabomber 
story right now, ironically enough. We have seen some very unfortunate 
and horrible shootings at abortion clinics and, after 30 peaceful years, 
an attempt to smear a lot of pro-life Americans, saying that these shooters
are representative; and then a man who by news accounts is a radical
environmentalist bombs quite a few people and in fact was involved,
they say, with Earth First, even killing people on an Earth First
hit list.

<p>

It has been interesting the way in which these two stories
have been handled and how people on both sides have been characterized.
What is your take on the way these pro-life and environmentalist
issues have been played?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, there clearly is a double standard, but first of all, 
let's make clear that everybody understands that we condemn, obviously, 
the abortion clinic shootings. Those have been terrible, terrible events, 
and the people responsible for them ought to be punished and sentenced 
to the full extent of the law.

<p>

What has been unfortunate, however, is the effort
of the pro-abortion side to take these incidents and blame them
or try to hang them on everyone who is pro-life.  I travel all
around the country, and I see tens of thousands of people sacrificing
financially and otherwise to help women in crisis pregnancy.
You've got crisis pregnancy clinics all over the country.  These
abortion murderers don't represent the pro-life movement.

<p>

But as you point out, here we have the Unabomber, who appears to be
an environmentalist, a radical environmentalist, associated in
some way with the group Earth First -- more investigation will
have to be done about that -- and yet the media is generally silent
about that connection.  The same media that wants to try to hang
a deranged killer at an abortion clinic and use him to smear the
whole pro-life movement is relatively silent when it comes to
using the Unabomber to raise questions about whether radical 
environmentalism has gone too far.

<p>

So I guess I would just ask that the standards be the same here. If 
pro-life rhetoric can be held to be responsible for a deranged 
individual, then I don't see how radical pro-environmental
rhetoric can't be held to the same standard when it comes to somebody
like the man that has been alleged to do these bombings.  Clearly,
the liberal bias of the media comes through time and time again,
and it is certainly pronounced in this case.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One last question, Gary.  As you know, President Clinton 
has tended to veto pro-life measures or to deal with abortion-related 
bills in the dead of night or on the weekend or sometimes in the middle
of, even once, a bombing that the United States was involved with.

<p>

What is your analysis on when this particular Partial Birth Abortion
Ban Act will be handled?

<p>

MR. BAUER: I think the best prediction is that it will happen late 
on a Friday when most of the media is already focused on other things, 
or it will happen on a day when there is big news someplace else, 
either foreign policy news and so forth.

<p>

This White House has shown a very clear pattern
of doing things it doesn't want the public to focus on at times
when the media is not going to be watching very closely, and I
suspect the same thing will happen on this.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you so much, Gary, for being with us.

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Thank you, Kristi.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, we will begin our
discussion regarding same-sex marriage and how it could dramatically
influence society both today and forever.  Stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Webster's Dictionary defines marriage as
the state of being united to a person of the opposite sex as husband
or wife, one woman and one man.  As basic and familiar as the
definition may sound, the literal and fundamental meaning of marriage
may undergo a drastic change if homosexual activists have their
way.  Currently across the nation, the battle to redefine marriage
and family is being waged.  Studies, statistics, and basic common
sense tell us that marriage between a man and a woman stabilizes
sexuality and provides the best environment in which to procreate
and raise children.  This has been found true both in research
and in all of recorded history.  The family, based on a committed
man and woman, exists as the foundation of society before recorded
time.

<p>

Yet homosexual activists seek to legitimize their relationships
by forcing acceptance of same-sex couples under the law.  It has
become clear that the mere tolerance of homosexual relationships
is no longer enough.

<p>

Some may question whether the decision to allow same-sex marriage 
would really do that much damage.  But those people may want to ask 
themselves whether they are willing to have businesses required to 
have family health benefits for homosexual couples, to have their 
children taught in school that homosexual sex is the moral equivalent 
of marital love, and to endorse adoption of children by homosexual 
couples.

<p>

Marriage has been revered and protected throughout the world because 
that specific and special relationship benefitted not only the people in 
them but the societies as well.  Legally destroying the exclusive territory
of marriage to achieve a political end will not provide the real
benefits of marriage to homosexuals, but it may be the blow that
the shattered American family does not survive.

<p>

To help us understand just how much a decision to redefine marriage to 
include same-sex relationships could change all of society, I am joined 
by two special guests:  Robert Knight, Director of Cultural Studies for
the Family Research Council, who has been one of the most influential
pro-family leaders in bringing this issue to light in research
and analysis; and Anthony Falzarano, Executive Director of Transformations
Ex-Gay Ministry, who works daily with men and women trying to
free themselves from the gay lifestyle.  Both are the most eloquent
experts on these issues today.

<p>

Welcome to the show.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: Great to be here.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Thanks for the introduction, too.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You're welcome.  Most of the time you're one amongst
many anti; it is only fair that you're acknowledged for the 
contributions that you both have made.

<p>

I wanted to start -- as I talk about this issue, as you all both 
do very eloquently, so many people do not understand why we should 
care.  You know, look, they're already out there. There are already 
homosexuals and lesbians in relationships.  So they have a marriage 
ceremony.  What does it hurt?  And I ask you, what does it hurt?

<p>

Bob, I will start with you, and then Anthony.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, a lot of people don't realize that what they're 
seeking is not so much acceptance for individual relationships as a 
larger goal, which is acceptance within the law, which forces it on 
everybody else.

<p>

See, when you have a couple homosexuals who say, &quot;Well, we want to
commit to ourselves,&quot; and then they go have a ceremony, they've
got that right in this country.  It's a free country.  But when
they bring the law into it, they bring us all into it.  They tell
us all that this marriage license is now the same as mom and dad
over here, and that cheapens mom and dad's marriage license, because
suddenly that marriage, the word &quot;marriage&quot; doesn't
mean what it used to mean.  It's not a very specific, defined
thing.

<p>

When you do that, when you bring a counterfeit version
in, that hurts the original.  It hurts support for the original
within the law.  People have worked very hard over the years to
support marriage within the law by setting aside specific benefits
for it, protections.  You know, spouses can't testify against
each other in trials, and all kinds of things.

<p>

Support for these kinds of special set-asides would erode if the 
institution itself suddenly ceases to be that special man-woman 
unique relationship that is the heart of civilization.

<p>

We can't do without it, and that's the bottom line.  The state knows 
that. Even if the state didn't believe that any religion was valid -- 
Christianity, Judaism, Islam, anything -- they would still support 
marriage because it has such a wide array of social benefits.  There 
is no society on Earth that has functioned without marriage, and there 
are many that have gone into the dust bin of history as soon as they 
cheapened marriage:  Rome, Greece, some of the middle Chinese dynasties.
When marriage became cheapened, the social fabric began to unravel.

<p>

And we're seeing that in this country.  We have already cheapened
marriage with easy divorce.  We have prenuptial agreements, we
have people living together.  It has already hurt marriage.  But
this would be the final blow, to say that it doesn't even have
to be a man and a woman.  It could be two guys.  And if you're
at that point, why not three guys or four guys?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There are so many interesting countervailing trends right 
now. You have a move to get rid of no-fault divorce because we say
divorce has unraveled our society.  You have men's movements saying
we need fathers involved with their children.  And then you have
this whole homosexual activist movement saying, Oh, all of that
is null and void; we really just need to expand and have it mean
even less than it does today.

<p>

Anthony, you understand this very well.  Why do you think it matters 
whether or not we legally change the definition of marriage?

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: This is extremely important. I would obviously agree 
with Bob.  Basically, the homosexual, let's say the political gay 
community, is out to destroy the traditional marriage, heterosexual 
marriage, that God has designed for us. God deemed that the male 
would leave his parents and cling onto the female and the two would 
become one.

<p>

Basically, our country was founded on those Judeo-Christian 
values, and God has blessed our country because we have stood for 
those values. But over the last 25 years we have seen an incredible 
deterioration of those values.

<p>

What the gays are up to is, they can't change the church in our 
country.  They can't change the mainline church. They can't change 
the Roman Catholic church.  They can't change the mainline Protestant 
church's view of homosexuality:  it is sinful behavior.

<p>

So, basically, what they started with in 1973 was going to the 
next most important authority, which was the
American Psychological Association, and they pushed homosexuality
out of the <i>APA Journal</i>, and when the APA decided that they would
take homosexuality out of the DSM-III, which is the official digest
of mental illnesses in this country, with that they now had permission
from an authority to go to our Federal Government and go to our
state government and say, &quot;See, these professionals do not
consider this to be a mental illness; therefore, you are discriminating
against us, and you are going to have to give us our rights.&quot;

<p>

And now they are trying to get gay marriage pushed onto our country,
because then they can now go after the church, and they can say,
&quot;Well, the American Psychiatric Association says we're normal,
the Federal Government, the state government says we're normal;
therefore, if you don't start hiring us in that local Catholic
church or that local Protestant church or in that Christian day
school, we're going to sue you, and if you don't conform, the
Federal Government is going to take your 501(c)(3) status away
and is going to take your full tax-exempt status away; therefore,
many of these churches will not be able to survive.&quot;

<p>

It's just like Georgetown University was forced to have a pro-gay group
on their campus, and it's against Catholic teaching.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Georgetown, a Catholic University that we have to mention.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  Yes, and they get federal funding from the government.
And if you take that $40 or $50 million away, whatever that figure
is, Georgetown University will be out of business tomorrow.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think it is interesting to note not only how accurate
that prediction is for future society but present society.  A
gentleman in Seattle, for example, that called Family Research
Council not too long ago.  He was a business owner, had hired
a gentleman who was a homosexual as an accountant.  They did not
have the business to keep him employed, and so they had to lay
him off, and a suit was filed that it was homosexual discrimination
because this gentleman played Christian music in the business
that he owned.  Because of that, he is fighting an expensive lawsuit
on antidiscrimination grounds saying that his faith is the problem,
and it's an extraordinary case.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes. Here are some other cases.  Shell Oil Company on the 
West Coast, there was a homosexual higher level executive who used the 
company fax machine and the xerox machine to make fliers advertising a 
gay orgy. You know, it was a very explicit flier.  Well, that's not 
conduct suitable for a high executive at Shell Oil Company, so they fired
him.

<p>

He came back and said, &quot;Well, you fired me because I'm
gay.&quot;  So under California's gay rights law, he sued; he
won millions from Shell Oil Company.

<p>

That's what we're talking about whenever you're talking about gay 
rights. You're talking about giving somebody a gun to put at the head 
of anybody who disagrees with them, whether it's the Boy Scouts, whether 
it's a local dry-cleaning establishment or a giant corporation like
Shell Oil.

<p>

That's another reason we're fighting this whole gay
marriage idea, because when you create something that's immoral,
which gay marriage certainly is, by any stretch, by any religious
value system and tradition, and then you put it into the law,
you make everybody who disagrees a moral outlaw.  You make people
who disagree find themselves the target of civil suits, harassment
at work.

<p>

I just got a call today from a guy who works for a federal
contractor, and he has been fired from his job by a homosexual
supervisor who had been hiring homosexuals, and they found out
he was Christian and harassed him and finally fired him.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Amazing. And it's only the beginning.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: It's just the beginning.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  This is only the beginning.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And we're going to have to hear more
about this after the break.  Please join us after the commercial
break as we continue to discuss the homosexual agenda regarding
marriage and family. Stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. Tonight we are discussing the drastic ramifications of 
changing marriage to including same-sex relationships, and I am joined
again by Robert Knight, Director of Cultural Studies for the Family
Research Council, and Anthony Falzarano, Executive Director of
Transformations Ex-Gay Christian Ministries.  Thank you so much
again for being with us.

<p>

There is a lot of activity going on in Hawaii right now, and, Bob, 
we are going to get to you on that in a second, where the law is 
being a frontal attack.

<p>

But, Anthony, one thing that has been interesting to me in a lot of 
the homosexual activist literature is there's this myth out there that 
most homosexual relationships are two men, two women that have been 
together for 30 years and that we're merely going to legalize with this 
change something that is already taking place.  And yet the gay literature
is very clear that not only do they want to call the relationships
marriage; they don't want their marriages to be the same as what
we would call good marriages.  Could you explain that?

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: Yes.  Well, basically, it is all propaganda.  They cannot 
sell short-term marriages to the American public.  They cannot sell
a marriage where there are three guys living in sin together.
So, basically, they choose, a certain amount of gays -- and there
are a certain percentage that are together in monogamous relationships,
but I can assure you, they are an extreme minimum.  Most homosexuals
are still highly promiscuous, even in the age of AIDS.  And, basically,
they get these people, they look all scrubbed, all American, they
have a house with a white picket fence in Falls Church, Virginia,
and you just think, Wow, they're just wonderful people; how can
we discriminate against these people?  And, basically, they are
pushing this pro-gay agenda onto the American public.  If they
can get --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  But the gay literature -- one thing
that has been interesting to me is the gay literature has come
right out and said we can't keep monogamy in our definition of
marriage.  We may have a significant relationship we'll call marriage,
but things like monogamy and fidelity, faithfulness, and lifetime
kind of till-death-do-us-part commitments are a little unrealistic.
So we want it to be marriage, but we don't want it to be monogamous.

<p>

It has been a strange delinking of monogamy.  But why do you think
that has --

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  Well, it's political.  Basically, they want to be 
able to get, if they have a boyfriend and they
work at AT&amp;T, which is a very pro-gay organization right now,
they want to be able to have that boyfriend have insurance benefits.
I mean, you can hook up with a guy who is your friend who has
AIDS and he has no health insurance, and that's very sad, but
in our country he would never be denied health care, but with
certain corporations you're going to get better health care, so
they can claim that they are in a monogamous relationship, and
therefore, you have to extend benefits to my boyfriend.

<p>

I mean, there are a lot of reasons why they are doing this, but what we
really have to focus in on is this is an attack on Judeo-Christian
values in this country.  This is an assault on traditional Judeo-Christian
marriage, and if the American public falls for this and allows
homosexual marriage to be officially recognized in the courts,
you are opening up a whole can of worms.  You are opening up the
insurance industry, the wills.  A lot of times if someone has
--

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Education.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  -- education -- you know, this is my boyfriend. He 
can bring this boyfriend into class and introduce him to 12-year-old 
children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Sure.

<p>
MR. FALZARANO:  It's a whole can of worms, and it's so
beautifully packaged by organizations like the Human Rights Campaign
Fund.  I mean, I was on a show with the director of that organization,
and she was quoting -- I don't know where she got her statistics
from, but she was quoting a study that says that America really
is for gay marriage.  And when she started giving off her data,
she said, &quot;Well, in this study, 48 percent are undecided.&quot;
I said, &quot;Well, where are you getting this propaganda from?&quot;
I said, &quot;What kind of study would have credibility where
48 percent of the study is undecided?&quot;

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Is &quot;I don't know,&quot; right.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  America is against gay marriage.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Oh, yes.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  And, hopefully, they will never accept it, or the 
wrath of God will come upon this country.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Well, interestingly enough, Hawaii has been the 
spearpoint state for driving gay marriage into the country, and 
yet, apparently, the spear point got a little blunted this week. 
Bob, what happened?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Boy, did it!  Well, it started last week. They released 
the latest poll of Hawaiians, and what had been a 71 percent figure 
opposing same-sex marriage rose to 74 percent.  That was reported 
in the major Honolulu newspapers. The percentage just keeps rising 
as people understand the threat that gay marriage, so called, poses.

<p>

But yesterday there was a major victory in the Senate.  There was a 
bill that went through the Senate unanimously, 24 to nothing, banning 
same-sex marriage, reaffirming the state's commitment to one man-one 
woman marriage, and stating the reasons for it.  This was all done 
because a court case is coming up in Hawaii in a circuit court, sent 
down from the Supreme Court, expected to be heard in August, in which 
three couples have challenged the marriage license law.

<p>

The Supreme Court had told the state of Hawaii, find a compelling 
interest to preserve one man-one woman marriage or we are going to 
open it up to same-sex relationships.

<p>

So now the Senate has moved. Liberal Hawaii, liberal Democrats and 
moderate Republicans and some conservatives, all voting to preserve 
marriage.  That has got to send a signal to the courts, and it should 
send a signal to the rest of America that you don't want this, folks.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: People don't, I think, understand [that] to redefine 
marriage is to open -- some things we are going to talk about in the 
next segment, adoption of children, to change our educational system,
to say that any kind of sex practice is morally neutral.  Here
we are struggling with rising STD rates and you have a growing
abstinence movement and just plain an attempt to decrease sexually
transmitted diseases among kids and a crippling infertility rate,
and then we are going to say that all sex practices, despite these
horrible figures, the sex that you have is insignificant.

<p>

There are all these strange counter-trends going on, but I think one
of the interesting significances of Hawaii is, if Hawaii, that
one state, changes their law, the rest of the nation is changed.
Bob, could you explain that for the viewers?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes. Because of the full faith and credit clause of the 
Constitution, states are supposed to recognize licenses from out of 
state, like a driver's license.  If a gay couple from, say, Ohio flies 
to Honolulu, gets married under a brand-new gay marriage law in Hawaii
and goes back to Ohio, they can present their marriage license
and say, &quot;Look, you have to recognize it with all the benefits
and status and privileges it brings.&quot;  That gives Ohio a
huge problem under the full faith and credit clause.  If they
don't recognize it, the gay couple is going to haul them into
court and say, &quot;You're denying us our basic human rights.&quot;

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Based on the Constitution, even.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Based on the Constitution.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  And what is incredible about
that is that a lot of states are adopting anti-gay marriage laws
right now, but, you see, the gays aren't concerned about that.
They are going to go up to the Supreme Court, which will override
the state laws, and that is what they are really up to, taking
this up to the Supreme Court.  They are assaulting the American
public right now.  They are extremely organized, and if they don't
win in Hawaii, they are going to hit California; they are going
to hit another liberal state; and eventually, they are going to
try to break through.  That is what they are up to.

<p>

If the American public doesn't wise up to this, then evil thrives 
when good men and women do nothing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Absolutely. 

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: I can tell you one thing about the --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You're going to have to tell me this after the break, 
because we are going to hear more about this.  When <i>Straight Talk</i> 
returns, we will hear more about how same-sex marriage affects the family 
and America's children.  Please stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>.

<p>

Legalizing same-sex marriage not only touches the lives of those
involved in the relationships; it also affects America's children
by opening the door to gay adoption and much more.

<p>

To shed light on this, back again are Bob Knight and Anthony Falzarano.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: Again.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Again.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: Are we eloquent still?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Eloquent and continuing to be eloquent.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

But I wanted to let you wrap up one point before we
get into the real reason why so many of us are fighting this,
which is for today's children.  But why is it, Anthony, homosexuals
and lesbians have made tremendous gains in societies?  I mean,
Hollywood and really in the job and a lot of different settings.
Why do they keep coming?  Why now gay marriage?

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: I am the director of an ex-gay ministry.  I am a former 
homosexual myself.  I was gay for nine years before I got saved and 
became a Christian and the blood of Jesus Christ washed over me.

<p>

Basically, I had no problem getting an apartment if I made enough money,
just like anybody else.  No one ever turned me down for an apartment.
There are certain gays out there that just want to push into
the landlord's face that I'm a homosexual and you can't keep me
out.

<p>

Basically, homosexuality is a neurosis.  It's healable, it's
treatable.  We are ministering to 6,000 former homosexuals in
the Exodus network.  Basically, homosexuality is a stunting of
psychosexual growth.  They are children inside, and any parents
out there -- you know, when your kid is spoiled, he'll keep coming
at you and keep coming at you and keep coming at you until you
give him a whack on the bottom and say, &quot;Enough!&quot; and
then the child will stop.

<p>

The American public has got to start treating the homosexual community 
in that way. They've got to say, &quot;Enough is enough.  You have 
enough benefits. You can live in your subculture, but please do not 
push this on our Judeo-Christian values.&quot;

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And the reason why they're stunted, I think you need 
to bring that up.  A lot of people were molested; there were some 
serious events in their lives.  We know from psychological
research that powerful and crushing events do stunt growth.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO: Of course. Eighty percent of the people that have
come to Transformation in Washington have been sexually abused
as children.  Ninety-eight percent of them did not bond with their
same-sex parent.  And, basically, that is the main cause of homosexuality.
And when we treat those symptoms with the love of the Christian
church, people start to recover from homosexuality.

<p>

We see people go on to heterosexual marriage.  We put marriages back 
together. We see people go on to seminary.  These people don't necessarily
want to be gay.  They are being sold a bill of goods by the political
pro-gay factions that are in this country, and we need to get
the word out that you don't have to be gay and that there are
options, and I believe that many homosexuals, if they knew that
they had an option, would take that option to become ex-gay.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, one of the things that you have been studying has
been the sexualizing of children and the way in which children
have become a political football.  But they are the real goal
here.

<p>

It was interesting, during the gay march here in Washington,
D.C., one of the constant chants was, &quot;Ten percent is not
enough; recruit, recruit, recruit,&quot; which kind of flies in
the face of their biological argument.

<p>

Why are children the key issue here with the gay marriage debate?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, because when you legitimatize gay marriage, you 
really can't say no to adoption of children in same-sex households, 
because you have destroyed the gender distinction, the idea that men 
and women are different, complementary, have something special to offer
each other and to their children.

<p>

It is kind of the Equal Rights Amendment. It is creeping in through the 
back door saying men and women are interchangeable; there is no 
difference, so let's not make any distinctions at all.  That's what 
it's all about. That's why it's not just live and let live, have a gay 
couple down the street get a marriage license.  It's so much bigger than
that. I think what has not been said often enough is that children
really do need a mother and a father.  A little boy needs to have
a father to learn what it is to be a man and to have his growing
masculinity affirmed, and he needs to have a mother for that mother
love, and to watch both parents interact and see how men should
treat women, women should treat men, how they both treat each
other as husbands and wives, mothers and fathers, and their relationship
with their children.

<p>

In a gay household, these same-sex households that are now adopting 
children, the child immediately doesn't have a father or a mother, 
one or the other, so the kid is already at a disadvantage. Then the 
child sees a distorted view of sexuality because of the homosexuality 
going on, and then that child is intensely curious about what men 
and women do together, what relationships they have.

<p>

I know a guy who has just entered jail, tragically,
because he grew up in a lesbian household.  He still loves his
mother and doesn't really blame her, but he said, &quot;You know,
as a boy in a lesbian environment where it was intensely anti-male&quot;
-- that's all he heard, this bitterness toward men -- he said
that he felt totally disenfranchised, began having sexual problems.
He eventually became a voyeur, and he is in on a peeping Tom
charge.  He was so curious about how normal people have sex. We
have other people that are cases like this.

<p>

One case will not a principle make, but this guy is a symptom, and it 
shows that without a dad in the house to set him straight, he really 
ran into a lot of problems.

<p>

MR. FALZARANO:  That is right.  There is a case in the Rhode Island 
court system right now.  This poor father called me, and he says, 
&quot;I need help.&quot;  Basically, his wife left him for a woman, 
and basically, there is a custody fight over the two girls, two young 
girls in the family.

<p>

Basically, the judge said to this young father, &quot;Look, I'm not 
concerned if your wife is a lesbian.  I want to find out who is the most
suitable parent to take custody over these children.&quot;  And
he describes how unstable his former wife's girlfriend is, and
to expose two pure young girls to a lesbian relationship -- it's
child abuse, and I can't believe the courts would even consider
giving custody to this woman.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  But if you get same-sex marriage, the courts are going 
to have no choice.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: They'll have no options.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Because marriage is a privilege,
and it's a benefit, and the state really does set a big fence
around it to protect it.  So if the state thinks enough of that
relationship to give it all these special benefits and says this
is okay, you will have no defense against homosexuals saying,
&quot;We want children, too.  We're going to have them, and by
the way, we're going to teach them that homosexuality is okay
in the schools.&quot;

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  But the reason why we benefit [from] marriage is 
because marriages benefit society.  It is not a random social gift. 
People fare better, children fare better.

<p>

I want to thank my guests.  I want to encourage people to call
and write these different organizations for more about this. 
When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> will show you some video clips 
highlighting the homosexual marriage and adoption issues. Don't go 
away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council></i>.

<p>

Robert Knight has appeared on many confrontational
television shows, and tonight we will share a couple of those
with you as Bob discussed some same-sex marriage and homosexual
adoption issues.  Let's take a look at clips from ABC's 
<i>Nightline</i> and <i>Oprah</i> as we bring you Homefront News.

<p>

[Segment from ABC <i>Nightline</i>, September 25, 1995, follows:]

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Marriage is the uniting of the two sexes.
That's the definition.  So when homosexuals say, &quot;We want
the right to marry,&quot; they've already got it, but they don't
meet the requirements.  The requirements are --

<p>

MR. KOPPEL: Defined by whom?  Defined by whom?  Requirements as 
defined by whom?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Every major culture on the planet, all major religions. 
I mean, Ted, come on.  You're talking as if marriage hadn't existed, 
something we invented to oppress homosexuals, and that's nonsense.  
It is the building block.

<p>

MR. KOPPEL:  No, no, no.  What I am doing, Mr. Knight --
and forgive me; we should let our other guests have a chance to
get in here, too -- but what I am saying is that marriage -- you
refer to marriage as though it was some unchanging institution
that has not in any manner been modified over the years, and clearly,
it has.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, it has not been modified to the extent
that the homosexuals are asking, which is to eliminate an entire
gender from it.  It's the bringing together of the two sexes.
Once you don't do that, you leave an entire gender out, that
makes it something else entirely.  It's not the same psychological
dynamics, emotional dynamics.  Homosexuals do not do what mom
and dad do in the bedroom.  They don't provide children the role
models that mom and dad do.  It's an entirely different animal
and doesn't deserve the same benefits that society gives marriages.

<p>

[Segment from Oprah, January 26, 1996, follows:]

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: -- and that is why kids ought to be in marriages, not in 
gay households.  They need mothers and fathers.  Okay?

<p>

I want to ask the viewers.  I want to ask the viewers, do they really 
think their mom could be replaced by two gay men; or their dad, their
father, by two women?  Sexuality is not a small thing.  Boys need
fathers.  Girls do, too, so they understand men.

<p>

GUEST: People need loving parents.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Love is great, okay?  Love is great, but sexuality is 
important.  There are two different, complementary
sexes.  You guys are pretending people are interchangeable and
there's no difference.

<p>

GUEST: There's no pretending anywhere.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  There are a lot of people who are screwed up with
their gender identity because they didn't bond with their fathers
or their mothers.

<p>

GUEST: The question here is we're talking about
protecting children.  Lesbian and gay families do exist, and the
question is, are we going to protect the children here?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes, we should.

<p>

GUEST: Are we going to entitle the children to child support?

<p>

MS. WINFREY:  I will tell you this.  May I just
interrupt this?  I've done this show before.  I've been down this
road, and years ago we did this show and I was so moved by the
children.  If you ask the children, the children will tell you
they want to be in a family where people love them, whether they
are two men, two women, a woman and a man.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

If you ask the children, that's what the children will tell you. 
The children just want people -- want to be loved and nurtured and
guided.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Okay, if a child told you, &quot;I'd rather
have three or four parents than two,&quot; would you say, &quot;Oh,
that's okay.  The kid wants it, so it must be right&quot;?  Who
do we decide?  Aren't we adults?  Come on, parents know better
than children know what they need.

<p>

GUEST: Listen. Look at society --

<p>

MS. WINFREY:  I'm just saying, ask the children.  Ask the
children, if they have a choice between being in a home with a
man and a woman who did not care for them or a man and woman who
had all these problems, divorce and fighting, arguing, abuse and
all that --

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  You can't compare a worst-case scenario
with something that's totally different.  You could say, well,
is a kid better off in a burning house or over here in a safe
gay household?  I mean, you could invent thousands of scenarios
like that.  Let's not be absurd.  There's a mountain of evidence.

<p>

MS. WINFREY:  Robert, I wasn't trying to be absurd, you know.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, I'm sorry.  That's how it came across to me.
There are mountains of evidence that show that kids do best in
mom-and-dad families.  You can't deny it.

<p>
