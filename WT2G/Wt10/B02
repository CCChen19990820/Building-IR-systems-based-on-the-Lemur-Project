The <TT>`/multimedia/images/wx'</TT> directory contains GIF
weather images of North America.  Files are updated hourly and take this
general form: <TT>`CV100222'</TT>.  The first two letters tell the type of file: CV
means it is a visible-light photo taken by a weather satellite.  CI
images are similar, but use infrared light.  Both these are in black and
white.  Files that begin with SA are color radar maps of the U.S. that
show severe weather patterns but also fronts and temperatures in major
cities.  The numbers indicate the date and time (in GMT - five hours
ahead of EST) of the image: the first two numbers represent the month,
the next two the date, the last two the hour. The file <TT>`WXKEY.GIF'</TT>
<A NAME="IDX423"></A>

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - ncftp</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_175.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_177.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC179" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC179">ncftp -- Now You Tell Me!</A></H2>
<P>
If you're lucky, the people who run your host system or public-
access site have installed a program called ncftp, which takes some of 
the edges off the ftp process.
<P>
For starters, when you use ncftp instead of plain old ftp, you no 
longer have to worry about misspelling "anonymous" when you connect.  The 
program does it for you.  And once you're in, instead of getting line 
after line filled with dashes, x's, r's and d's, you only get listings of 
the files or directories themselves (if you're used to MS-DOS, the 
display you get will be very similar to that produced by the <SAMP>`dir/w'</SAMP> 
command).  The program even creates a list of the ftp sites you've used 
most recently, so you can pick from that list, instead of trying to 
remember some incredibly complex ftp site name.
<P>
Launching the program, assuming your site has it, is easy.  At the 
command prompt, type
<P>
<PRE>
ncftp sitename
<A NAME="IDX431"></A>
<A NAME="IDX432"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
where "sitename" is the site you want to reach (alternately, you could 
type just ncftp and then use its open command).  Once connected, you can 
use the same ftp commands you've become used to, such as ls, get and 
mget.  Entries that end in a <SAMP>`/'</SAMP> are directories to which you can switch 
with <SAMP>`cd'</SAMP>; others are files you can get. A couple of useful ncftp commands 
include type, which lets you change the type of file transfer (from ASCII 
to binary for example) and size, which lets you see how large a file is 
before you get it, for example
<P>
<PRE>
size declaration.txt
</PRE>
<P>
would tell you how large the declaration.txt file is before you get it.  
When you say <SAMP>`bye'</SAMP> to disconnect from a site, ncftp remembers the last 
directory you were in, so that the next time you connect to the site, you 
are put back into that directory automatically. If you type <SAMP>`help'</SAMP>
you'll get a list of files you can read to extend the power of the 
program even further.

Project Gutenberg, coordinated by Michael Hart, has a fairly 
ambitious goal: to make more than 10,000 books and other documents 
available electronically by the year 2001.  In 1993, the project uploaded 
an average of four books a month to its ftp sites; in 1994, they hope to 
double the pace.
<P>
Begun in 1991, the project already maintains a "library" of hundreds 
of books and stories, from Aesop's Fables to "Through the Looking Glass" 
available for the taking.  It also has a growing number of current-affairs
documents, such as the CIA's annual "World Factbook" almanac.
<P>
Besides <B>nptn.org</B>, Project Gutenberg texts can be retrieved from 
<A NAME="IDX433"></A>
<B>mrcnext.cso.uiuc.edu</B> in the etext directory.

<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_180.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_182.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC184" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC184">Gophers</A></H2>
<P>
Even with tools like Hytelnet and archie, telnet and ftp can still
be frustrating.  There are all those telnet and ftp addresses to
remember.  Telnet services often have their own unique commands.  And,
oh, those weird directory and file names!
<P>
But now that the Net has become a rich repository of information,
people are developing ways to make it far easier to find and retrieve 
information and files. Gophers and Wide-Area Information Servers (WAISs) 
are two services that could ultimately make the Internet as easy to 
navigate as commercial networks such as CompuServe or Prodigy.
<P>
Both gophers and WAISs essentially take a request for information 
and then scan the Net for it, so you don't have to.  Both also work 
through menus -- instead of typing in some long sequence of characters, 
you just move a cursor to your choice and hit enter.  Gophers even 
let you select files and programs from ftp sites this way. 
<P>
Let's first look at gophers (named for the official mascot of the 
<A NAME="IDX434"></A>
University of Minnesota, where the system was developed).
<P>
Many public-access sites now have gophers online.  To use one, type
<P>
<PRE>
gopher
</PRE>
<P>
at the command prompt and hit enter.  If you know your site does not have 
a gopher, or if nothing happens when you type that, telnet to
<P>
<PRE>
consultant.micro.umn.edu
</PRE>
<P>
At the log-in prompt, type
<P>
<PRE>
gopher
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  You'll be asked what type of terminal emulation you're
using, after which you'll see something like this:
<P>

Press ? for Help, q to Quit, u to go up a menu      Page: 1/1
</PRE>
<P>
Assuming you're using VT100 or some other VT emulation, you'll be 
able to move among the choices with your up and down arrow keys.  When 
you have your cursor on an entry that looks interesting, just hit enter, 
and you'll either get a new menu of choices, a database entry form, or a 
text file, depending on what the menu entry is linked to (more on how to 
tell which you'll get in a moment).
<P>
Gophers are great for exploring the resources of the Net.  Just keep 
making choices to see what pops up.  Play with it; see where it takes 
you.  Some choices will be documents.  When you read one of these and 
either come to the end or hit a lower-case <SAMP>`q'</SAMP> to quit reading it, you'll 
be given the choice of saving a copy to your home directory or e-mailing 
it to yourself.  Other choices are simple databases that let you enter a 
word to look for in a particular database.  To get back to where you 
started on a gopher, hit your <SAMP>`u'</SAMP> key at a menu prompt, which will move you 
back "up" through the gopher menu structure (much like "cd .." in ftp).
<P>
Notice that one of your choices above is "Internet file server (ftp) 
sites."  Choose this, and you'll be connected to a modified archie 
program -- an archie with a difference.  When you search for a file 
through a gopher archie, you'll get a menu of sites that have the file 
you're looking for, just as with the old archie.  Only now, instead of 
having to write down or remember an ftp address and directory, all you 
have to do is position the cursor next to one of the numbers in the menu 
and hit enter.  You'll be connected to the ftp site, from which you can 
then choose the file you want.  This time, move the cursor to the file 
you want and hit a lower-case <SAMP>`s'</SAMP>.  You'll be asked for a name in your home 
directory to use for the file, after which the file will be copied to 
your home system.  Unfortunately, this file-transfer process does not yet 
work with all public-access sites for computer programs and compressed 
files.  If it doesn't work with yours, you'll have to get the file the 
old-fashioned way, via anonymous ftp. 
<P>
In addition to ftp sites, there are hundreds of databases and 
libraries around the world accessible through gophers.  There is not yet
a common gopher interface for library catalogs, so be prepared to follow
the online directions more closely when you use gopher to connect to
one.
<P>
Gopher menu entries that end in a <SAMP>`/'</SAMP> are gateways to another menu of 
options.  Entries that end in a period are text, graphics or program 
files, which you can retrieve to your home directory (or e-mail to 
yourself or to somebody else).  A line that ends in <SAMP>`&#60;?&#62;'</SAMP> or
<SAMP>`&#60;CSO&#62;'</SAMP> 
represents a request you can make to a database for information.  The 
difference is that <SAMP>`&#60;?&#62;'</SAMP> entries call up one-line interfaces in which you 
can search for a keyword or words, while <SAMP>`&#60;CSO&#62;'</SAMP> brings up an electronic 
form with several fields for you to fill out (you might see this in 
online "White Pages" directories at colleges).
<P>
Gophers actually let you perform some relatively sophisticated 
Boolean searches.  For example, if you want to search only for files that 
contain the words "MS-DOS" and "Macintosh," you'd type
<P>
<PRE>
ms-dos and macintosh
</PRE>
<P>
(gophers are not case-sensitive) in the keyword field.  Alternately, if 
you want to get a list of files that mention either "MS-DOS" or 
"Macintosh," you'd type
<P>
<PRE>
ms-dos or macintosh

As fascinating as it can be to explore "gopherspace," you might one 
day want to quickly retrieve some information or a file.  Or you might 
grow tired of calling up endless menus to get to the one you want. 
Fortunately,  there are ways to make even gophers easier to use. 
<P>
One is with archie's friend, veronica (it allegedly is an acronym, 
but don't believe that for a second), who does for gopherspace what 
<A NAME="IDX435"></A>
archie does for ftp sites. 
<P>
In most gophers, you'll find veronica by selecting "Other gopher and 
information services" at the main menu and then "Searching through 
gopherspace using veronica."  Select this and you'll get something like 
this:

Press ? for Help, q to Quit, u to go up a menu                Page: 1/1
</PRE>
<P>
A few choices there!  First, the difference between searching 
directory titles and just plain ol' gopherspace.  If you already know the 
sort of directory you're looking for (say a directory containing MS-DOS 
programs), do a directory-title search.  But if you're not sure what kind 
of directory your information might be in, then do a general 
gopherspace search. In general, it doesn't matter which of the particular 
veronicas you use -- they should all be able to produce the same results.  
The reason there is more than one is because the Internet has become so 
popular that only one veronica (or one gopher or one of almost anything) 
would quickly be overwhelmed by all the information requests from around 
the world.  
<P>
You can use veronica to search for almost anything.  Want to find 
museums that might have online displays from their exhibits?  Try 
searching for "museum."  Looking for a copy of the Declaration of 
Independence?  Try "declaration." 
<P>
In many cases, your search will bring up a new gopher menu of 
choices to try.
<P>
Say you want to impress those guests coming over for dinner on 
Friday by cooking cherries flambe. If you were to call up veronica and 
type in "flambe" after calling up veronica, you would soon get a menu 
listing several flambe recipes, including one called "dessert flambe."  
Put your cursor on that line of the menu and hit enter, and you'll find 
it's a menu for cherries flambe.  Then hit your <SAMP>`q'</SAMP> key to quit, and gopher 
will ask you if you want to save the file in your home directory on your 
public-access site or whether you want to e-mail it somewhere. 
<P>
As you can see, you can use veronica as an alternative to archie, 
which, because of the Internet's growing popularity, seems to take longer 
and longer to work.
<P>
In addition to archie and veronica, we now also have jugheads (no 
bettys yet, though).  These work the same as veronicas, but their 
<A NAME="IDX436"></A>
searches are limited to the specific gopher systems on which they reside.
<P>
If there are particular gopher resources you use frequently, there 
are a couple of ways to get to them even more directly.
<P>
One is to use gopher in a manner similar to the way you can use 
telnet. If you know a particular gopher's Internet address (often the 
same as its telnet or ftp address), you can connect to it directly, 
rather than going through menus.  For example, say you want to use the 
gopher at <B>info.umd.edu</B>.  If your public-access site has a gopher system 
installed, type this 
<P>
<PRE>
gopher info.umd.edu
</PRE>
and you'll be connected.
<P>
But even that can get tedious if there are several gophers you use 
frequently. That's where bookmarks come in.  Gophers let you create a 
list of your favorite gopher sites and even database queries.  Then, 
instead of digging ever deeper into the gopher directory structure, you 
just call up your bookmark list and select the service you want.
<P>
To create a bookmark for a particular gopher site, first call up 
gopher.  Then go through all the gopher menus until you get to the menu 
you want.  Type a capital <SAMP>`A'</SAMP>. You'll be given a suggested name for the 
bookmark enty, which you can change if you want by backspacing over the 
suggestion and typing in your own.  When done, hit enter.  Now, whenever 
you're in gopherspace and want to zip back to that particular gopher 
service, just hit your <SAMP>`V'</SAMP> key (upper- or lower-case; in this instance, 
gopher doesn't care) anywhere within gopher.  This will bring up a list 
of your bookmarks. Move to the one you want and hit enter, and you'll be 
connected.
<P>
Using a capital <SAMP>`A'</SAMP> is also good for saving particular database or 
veronica queries that you use frequently (for example, searching for 
news stories on a particular topic if your public-access site maintains 
an indexed archive of wire-service news).
<P>
Instead of a capital <SAMP>`A'</SAMP>, you can also hit a lower-case <SAMP>`a'</SAMP>.  This will 
bring you to the particular line within a menu, rather than show you the 
<A NAME="IDX437"></A>
entire menu.
<P>
If you ever want to delete a bookmark, hit <SAMP>`V'</SAMP> within gopher, select 
the item you want to get rid of, and then hit your <SAMP>`D'</SAMP> key.
One more hint:
If you want to find the address of a particular gopher service, hit 
your <SAMP>`='</SAMP> key after you've highlighted its entry in a gopher menu.  You'll 
get back a couple of lines, most of which will be technicalese of no 
immediate value to most folks, but some of which will consist of the 
site's address.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Wide-Area Information Servers</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_206.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_208.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC210" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC210">Wide-Area Information Servers</A></H2>
<P>
Now you know there are hundreds of databases and library catalogs
you can search through.  But as you look, you begin to realize that each
seems to have its own unique method for searching.  If you connect to
several, this can become a pain.  Gophers reduce this problem somewhat.
<P>
Wide-area information servers promise another way to zero in on
information hidden on the Net. In a WAIS, the user sees only one
interface -- the program worries about how to access information on
dozens, even hundreds, of different databases.  You give a WAIS a
word and it scours the net looking for places where it's mentioned.  You
get a menu of documents, each ranked according to how relevant to your
search the WAIS thinks it is.
<P>
Like gophers, WAIS "client" programs can already be found on many
public-access Internet sites. If your system has a WAIS client, type 
<P>
<PRE>
swais
</PRE>
<P>
at the command prompt and hit enter (the "s" stands for "simple").  If it 
doesn't, telnet to bbs.oit.unc.edu, which is run by the University of North
Carolina  At the "login:" prompt, type
<P>
<PRE>
bbs
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  You'll be asked to register and will then get a list of
"bulletins," which are various files explaining how the system works.
When done with those, hit your Q key and you'll get another menu.  Hit 4
for the "simple WAIS client," and you'll see something like this:

</PRE>
<P>
Each line represents a different database (the .au at the end of some of
them means they are in Australia; the .fr on the last line represents a
database in France).  And this is just the first page!  If you type a
capital K, you'll go to the next page (there are several pages).
Hitting a capital J will move you back a page.
<P>
The first thing you want to do is tell the WAIS program which
databases you want searched.  To select a database, move the cursor bar
over the line you want (using your down and up arrow keys) and hit your
space bar.  An asterisk will appear next to the line number.  Repeat this
until you've selected all of the databases you want searched.  Then hit
your W key, after which you'll be prompted for the key words you're
looking for.  You can type in an entire line of these words -- separate
each with a space, not a comma.
<P>
Hit return, and the search begins.
<P>
Let's say you're utterly fascinated with wheat.  So you might select
agricultural-market-news to find its current world price.  But you also
want to see if it has any religious implications, so you choose the
Bible and the Book of Mormon.  What do you do with the stuff?  Select
recipes and usenet-cookbook. Are there any recent Supreme Court
decisions involving the plant? Chose supreme-court.  How about synonyms?
Try roget-thesaurus and just plain thesaurus.
<P>
Now hit w and type in wheat.  Hit enter, and the WAIS program begins
its search.  As it looks, it tells you whether any of the databases are
offline, and if so, when they might be ready for a search.  In about a
minute, the program tells you how many hits it's found.  Then you get a new
menu, that looks something like this:

Each of these represents an article or citing that contains the word wheat,
or some related word.  Move the cursor bar (with the down and up arrow
keys) to the one you want to see, hit enter, and it will begin to appear
on your screen.  The "score" is a WAIS attempt to gauge how closely the
citing matches your request.  Doesn't look like the Supreme Court has had
anything to say about the plant of late!
<P>
Now think of how much time you would have spent logging onto various
databases just to find these relatively trivial examples.

<P>
Developed by researchers at <A HREF="http://info.cern.ch/">CERN</A>, the European Particle Physics
Laboratory in Geneva, the World-Wide Web is somewhat similar to a WAIS.  
But it's designed on a system known as hypertext.  Words in one document
are "linked" to other documents.  It's sort of like sitting with an
encyclopedia -- you're reading an article, see a reference that 
intrigues you and so flip the pages to look up that reference.
<P>
To take a walk on <A HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/DataSources/WWW/Geographical.html">The Web</A> try the WWW's (or W3 in the project's own jargon),
default telnet site:

There is no "top" to the World-Wide Web. You can look at it from many points
of view. If you have no other bias, here are some places to start:

                       but easiest to use.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Clients</TITLE>

<H2><A NAME="SEC212" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC212">Clients, or how to snare more on the Web</A></H2>
<P>
If you are used to plain-vanilla Unix or MS-DOS, then the way these
gophers and WAISs work seems quite straightforward.  But if you're used
to a computer with a graphical interface, such as a Macintosh, an IBM
compatible with Windows or a Next, you'll probably regard their
interfaces as somewhat primitive. And even to a veteran MS-DOS user, the 
World-Wide Web interface is rather clunky (and some of the documents and 
files on the Web now use special formatting that would confuse your poor 
<A NAME="IDX440"></A>
<A NAME="IDX441"></A>
<A NAME="IDX442"></A>
<A NAME="IDX443"></A>
<A NAME="IDX444"></A>
computer). 
<P>
There are, however, ways to integrate these services into your
graphical user interface.  In fact, there are now ways to tie into the
Internet directly, rather than relying on whatever interface your
public-access system uses, through what are known as "client" programs.  
These programs provide graphical interfaces for everything from ftp to 
the World-Wide Web.  
<P>
There is now a growing number of these "client" programs for
everything from ftp to gopher.  PSI of Reston, Va., which offers
nationwide Internet access, in fact, requires its customers to use these
programs. Using protocols known as SLIP and PPP, these programs communicate
with the Net using the same basic data packets as much larger computers
<A NAME="IDX445"></A>
<A NAME="IDX446"></A>
<A NAME="IDX447"></A>
online.
<P>
Beyond integration with your own computer's "desktop," client
programs let you do more than one thing at once on the net -- while you're
downloading a large file in one window, you can be chatting with a
friend through an Internet chat program in another.
<P>
Unfortunately, using a client program can cost a lot of money.  Some 
require you to be connected directly to the Internet through an Ethernet 
network for example.  Others work through modem protocols, such as SLIP, 
but public-access sites that allow such access may charge anywhere from 
<A NAME="IDX448"></A>
$25 to $200 a month extra for the service.
<P>
Your system administrator can give you more information on setting
up one of these connections.

<P>
As the Internet grows ever more popular, its resources come under 
more of a strain.  If you try to use gopher in the middle of the day, at 
least on the East Coast of the U.S., you'll sometimes notice that it 
takes a very long time for particular menus or database searches to come 
up.  Sometimes, you'll even get a message that there are too many people 
connected to whichever service you're trying to use and so you can't get 
in.  The only alternative is to either try again in 20 minutes or so, or 
wait until later in the day, when the load might be lower.  When this 
happens in veronica, try one of the other veronica entries.
<P>
When you retrieve a file through gopher, you'll sometimes be asked 
if you want to store it under some ludicrously long name (there go our 
friends the system administrators again, using 128 characters just 
because Unix lets them).  With certain MS-DOS communications programs, if 
that name is longer than one line, you won't be able to backspace all the 
way back to the first line if you want to give it a simpler name.  
Backspace as far as you can.  Then, when you get ready to download it to 
your home computer, remember that the file name will be truncated on your 
end, because of MS-DOS's file-naming limitations.  Worse, your computer
might even reject the whole thing. What to do? Instead of saving it to
your home directory, mail it to yourself.  It should show up in your mail
by the time you exit gopher.  Then, use your mail command for saving it
to your home directory -- at which point you can name it anything you want.
Now you can download it.

<P>
<B>David Riggins</B> maintains a list of gophers by type and category. You 
can find the most recent one at the ftp site <B>ftp.einet.net</B>, in the pub 
directory.  Look for a file with a name like <TT>`gopher-jewels.txt'</TT>. 
Alternately, you can get on a mailing list to get the latest version sent 
to your e-mailbox automatically. Send a mail message to
<TT>&lt;gopherjewelslist-request@tpis.cactus .org&gt;</TT>
(yep, that first part is all one word).  Leave 
the "subject:" line blank, and as a message, write SUBSCRIBE. 
<P>
The Interpedia project is an attempt to take gopher one step 
further, by creating an online repository of all of the interesting and 
useful information availble on the Net and from its users. To get on the 
mailing list for the project, send an e-mail message, with a "subject:" 
of "subscribe" to <TT>&lt;interpedia-request@telerama.lm.com&gt;</TT>.  You can get 
supporting documentation for the project via anonymous ftp at
<B>ftp.lm.com</B> 
in the <TT>`pub/interpedia'</TT> directory.
<P>
See also the Usenet newsgroups <TT>comp.infosystems.*</TT>:
<P>
<TT>comp.infosystems.gopher</TT>,
<TT>comp.infosystems.wais</TT>, and
<TT>comp.infosystems.www</TT> are places to go for technical discussions about
Gopher, WAISs, and the <A HREF="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html">World-Wide Web project</A> respectively.
Moreover there are <TT>comp.infosystems</TT> for more general discussion of
related issues.
The group <TT>comp.infosystems.gis</TT> relates to Geographic Information
Systems, and thus is more specialized on this subject.
<P>
At present, there are no veronica clients;  veronica is a gopher tool.
An informal veronica FAQ is posted regularly in <TT>comp.infosystems.gopher</TT>
and archived on <B>veronica.scs.unr.edu</B> as <TT>`veronica/veronica-faq'</TT>.
<P>
There even exists a Gopher service to read Usenet news:
<SAMP>`gopher gopher.msu.edu 4320'</SAMP>. But, the lines behind this
service are few, and thus it's likely that you get the following message,
when trying to enter:
<P>
<PRE>
We are sorry, but our Usenet News gateway limits the number of
simultaneous connections.  If you were attempting to read news and were
instead directed to this file, all of those connections are in use.  We
offer this gateway as a "last resort" for people who have no other
access for reading Usenet.  We do not have the capacity to serve as the
Usenet gateway for large numbers of users around the Internet.
Individuals who like this style of access should ask their Internet
service providers to offer the same sort of gateway on their local
Gopher server.  Individuals and campuses should consider installing
local news feeds and local news readers (such as RN, NN, TIN, or
Trumpet) so that users can read and post to Usenet newsgroups
conveniently.

For system administrators: the software we use to implement this gateway
is the go4gw Gopher gateway software from Roland Schemers of Stanford
University.  This software should be available by anonymous ftp from
boombox.micro.umn.edu, somewhere under /pub/gopher.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - The File is in the Mail</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_212.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_214.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC216" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC216">The File's in the Mail</A></H2>
E-mail by itself is a powerful tool, and by now you may be
sending e-mail messages all over the place.  You might even be on a
mailing list or two. But there is a lot more to e-mail than just
sending messages.  If your host system does not have access to ftp,
or it doesn't have access to every ftp site on the Net, you can have
programs and files sent right to your mailbox.  And using some simple
techniques, you can use e-mail to send data files such as spreadsheets,
or even whole programs, to friends and colleagues around the world.
<P>
A key to both is a set of programs known as encoders and
decoders.  For all its basic power, Net e-mail has a big problem: it
can't handle graphics characters or the control codes found in even
the simplest of computer programs. Encoders however, can translate
these into forms usable in e-mail, while decoders turn them back into
a form that you can actually use. If you are using a Unix-based host
system, chances are it already has an encoder and decoder online that
you can use. These programs will also let you use programs posted in
several Usenet newsgroups, such as <TT>comp.binaries.ibm.pc</TT>.
<P>
If both you and your intended recipient communicate via Unix-based
host systems, then it's pretty easy, because almost all Unix
host systems will have encoder/decoder programs online.
<P>
First, upload the file you want to send to your friend to your
host site.  Ask your system administrator how to upload a file to your
name or "home" directory.  Then type
<P>
<PRE>
uuencode file file &#62;file.uu
<A NAME="IDX449"></A>
<A NAME="IDX450"></A>
<A NAME="IDX451"></A>
<A NAME="IDX452"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter. "File" is the name of the file you want to prepare for
mailing, and yes, you have to type the name twice!  The &#62; is a Unix
command that tells the system to call the "encoded" file "file.uu"
(you could actually call it anything you want).
<P>
Now to get it into a mail message.  The quick and dirty way is to
type
<P>
<PRE>
mail friend
</PRE>
<P>
where "friend" is your friend's address.  At the subject line, tell
her the name of the enclosed file.  When you get the blank line, type
<P>
<PRE>
~r file.uu
</PRE>
<P>
or whatever you called the file, and hit enter. (on some systems, the <SAMP>`~'</SAMP>
may not work; if so, ask your system administrator what to use).  This
inserts the file into your mail message.  Hit control-D, and your file
is on its way!
<P>
On the other end, when your friend goes into his mailbox,  she
should transfer it to her home directory.  Then your friend should
type
<P>
<PRE>
uudecode file.name
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  This creates a new file in her name directory with
whatever name you originally gave it.  She can then download it to her
own computer.  Before she can actually use it, though, she'll have to
open it up with a text processor and delete the mail header that has
been "stamped" on it.  If you use a mailer program that automatically
appends a "signature," tell her about that so she can delete that as
well.

<H2><A NAME="SEC217" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC217">Receiving Files</A></H2>
<P>
If somebody sends you a file through the mail, you'll have to go 
through a couple of steps to get it into a form you can actually use.  If 
you are using the simple mail program, go into mail and type 
<P>
<PRE>
w # file.name
</PRE>
<P>
where <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> is the number of the message you want to transfer and 
<TT>`file.name'</TT> is what you want to call the resulting file.  In pine, call 
up the message and hit your O key and then E.  You'll then be asked 
for a file name. In elm, call up the message and hit your S key.  
You'll get something that looks like this: 
<P>
<PRE>
=file.request
</PRE>
<P>
Type a new file name and hit enter (if you hit enter without 
typing a file name, the message will be saved to another mail folder, 
not your home directory). 
<P>
In all three cases, exit the mail program to return to your host 
system's command line. Because the file has been encoded for mail 
delivery, you now have to run a decoder.  At the command line, type 
<P>
<PRE>
uudecode file.name
</PRE>
<P>
where <TT>`file.name'</TT> is the file you created while in mail. Uudecode will 
create a new, uncompressed binary file.  In some cases, you may have to 
run it through some other programs (for example, if it is in "tar" form), 
but generally it should now be ready for you to download to your own 
computer (on which you might then have to run a de-compressor program 
such as PKXZIP).

<P>
What if your friend only connects with a non-Unix system, such as 
CompuServe or MCIMail?  There are programs available for MS-DOS, Apple 
and Amiga computers that will encode and decode files.  Of course, since 
you can't send one of these programs to your friend via e-mail (how would 
she un-encode it?), you'll have to mail (the old-fashioned way) or give 
her a diskette with the program on it first.   Then, she can get the file 
by e-mail and go through the above process (only on her own computer) to 
get a usable file.  Remember to give her an encoder program as well, if 
she wants to send you files in return. 
<P>
For MS-DOS machines, you'll want to get uunecode.com and 
uudecode.com.  Both can be found through anonymous ftp at 
<B>wuarchive.wustl.edu</B> in the <TT>`/mirrors/msdos/starter'</TT> directory.
The MS-DOS version is as easy to use as the Unix one: Just type 
<P>
<PRE>
uudecode filename.ext
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.
<P>
Mac users should get a program called uutool, which can be found 
in the <TT>`info-mac/util'</TT> directory on <B>sumex-aim.stanford.edu</B>. 
<P>
Think twice before sending somebody a giant file. Although large 
sites connected directly to the Internet can probably handle mega-files, 
many smaller systems cannot. Some commercial systems, such as CompuServe 
and MCIMail, limit the size of mail messages their users can receive.  
Fidonet doesn't even allow encoded messages.  In general, a file size of 
30,000 or so bytes is a safe upper limit for non-Internet systems.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Getting FTP Files via E-Mail</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_215.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_217.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC219" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC219">Getting FTP Files via E-Mail</A></H2>
<P>
To help people without ftp access, a number of ftp sites have set up 
mail servers (also known as archive servers) that allow you to get files 
via e-mail.  You send a request to one of these machines and they send 
back the file you want.  As with ftp, you'll be able to find everything 
from historical documents to software (but please note that if you do 
have access to ftp, that method is always quicker and ties up fewer 
resources than using e-mail). 
<P>
Some interesting or useful mail servers include:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><TT>&lt;mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu&gt;</TT>
<DD>Files of "frequently asked questions" related to Usenet; state-by-state
lists of U.S. representatives and Senators and their addresses and office
phone numbers.
<P>
<DT><TT>&lt;archive-server@eff.org&gt;</TT>
<DD>Information about the Electronic Frontier
Foundation; documents about legal issues on the Net.
<P>
<DT><TT>&lt;archive-server@cs.widener.edu&gt;</TT>
<DD>Back copies of the Computer Underground
Digest and every possible fact you could want to know about "The
Simpsons."
<P>
<DT><TT>&lt;netlib@uunet.uu.net&gt;</TT>
<DD>Programs for many types of personal computers;
archives of past postings from many Usenet newsgroups.
<P>
<DT><TT>&lt;archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov&gt;</TT>
<DD>Space-related text and graphics
(GIF-format) files.
<P>
<DT><TT>&lt;service@nic.ddn.mil&gt;</TT>
<DD>Detailed information about Internet.
</DL>
<P>
Most mail servers work pretty much the same -- you send an e-mail 
message that tells them what file you want and how you want it sent to 
you.  The most important command is "send," which tells the computer you 
want it to send you a particular file. 
<P>
First, though, you'll need to know where the mail server stores 
that file, because you have to tell it which directory or sub-directory
it's in.  There are a couple of ways to do this. You can 
send an e-mail message to the archive-server that consists of one 
line: 
<P>
<PRE>
index
</PRE>
<P>
The server will then send you a directory listing of its main, or 
root directory.  You'll then have to send a second message to the 
archive server with one line: 
 
<PRE>
index directory/subdirectory
</PRE>
 
where that is the directory or directory path for which you want a 
listing.  An alternative is to send an e-mail message to our old 
friend archie, which should send you back the file's exact location on 
the archive-server (along with similar listings for all the other 
sites that may have the file, however)
<P>
Once you have the file name and its directory path, compose a 
message to the archive server like this:
 
<PRE>
send directory/subdirectory/file 
</PRE>
  
Send off the message and, anywhere from a few minutes to a couple 
of days later, you'll find a new message in your mailbox: a copy of the 
file you requested.  The exact time it will take a file to get to you 
depends on a variety of factors, including how many requests are in line 
before yours (mail servers can only process so many requests at a time) 
and the state of the connections between the server and you. 
<P>
Seems simple enough. It gets a little more complicated when you 
request a program rather than a document.  Programs or other files that 
contain unusual characters or lines longer than 130 characters (graphics 
files, for example) require special processing by both the mail server 
to ensure they are transmitted via e-mail.  Then you'll have to run them 
through at least one converter program to put them in a form you can 
actually use.  To ensure that a program or other "non-mailable" file 
actually gets to you, include another line in your e-mail message to the 
server: 
                                            
<PRE>
encoder                      
</PRE>
 
This converts the file into an encoded form.  To decode it, you'll 
first have to transfer the file message into a file in your home 
directory.  
<P>
One further complication comes when you request a particularly 
long file.  Many Net sites can only handle so much mail at a time.  To 
make sure you get the entire file, tell the mail server to break it up 
into smaller pieces, with another line in your e-mail request like 
this: 
 
<PRE>
size 100000
</PRE>
<P>
This gives the mail server the maximum size, in bytes, of each 
file segment.  This particular size is good for UUCP sites. Internet 
and Bitnet sites can generally go up to 300,000.  When you get all of 
these files in mail, transfer them to your home directory.  Exit mail 
and call up each file in your host system's text processor and delete 
each one's entire header and footer (or "signature" at the end).  When 
done with this, at your host system's command line, type 
 
<PRE>
cat file1 file2 &#62; bigfile
</PRE>
 
where file1 is the first file, file2 the second file, and so on.  The
<SAMP>`&#62;'</SAMP> tells your host system to combine them into a new megafile called 
bigfile (or whatever you want to call it).  After you save the file to 
your home directory (see section <A HREF="bdg_214.html#SEC217">Receiving Files</A> above), you can then run uudecode, 
tar, etc. One word of caution, though: if the file you want is long 
enough that it has to be broken into pieces, think of how much time it's 
going to take you to download the whole thing -- especially if you're 
using a 2400-baud modem! 
<P>
There are a number of other mail servers.  To get a list, send an 
e-mail message to:
<P>
<TT>&lt;mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu&gt;</TT>
 
<PRE>
send usenet/comp.sources.wanted/How_to_find_sources_(READ_THIS_BEFORE_POSTING)
</PRE>
 
You'll have to spell it exactly as listed above.  Some mail 
servers use different software, which will require slightly different 
commands than the ones listed here.  In general, if you send a message 
to a mail server that says only 
 
<PRE>
help
</PRE>
 
you should get back a file detailing all of its commands. 
<P>
But what if the file you want is not on one of these mail 
servers?  That's where ftpmail comes in.  Run by Digital Equipment 
Corp. in California, this service can connect to almost any ftp site 
in the world, get the file you want and then mail it to you. Using it 
is fairly simple -- you send an e-mail message to ftpmail that 
includes a series of commands telling the system where to find the 
<A NAME="IDX453"></A>
<A NAME="IDX454"></A>
<A NAME="IDX455"></A>
file you want and how to format it to mail to you. 
<P>
Compose an e-mail message to
 
<PRE>
ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com
</PRE>
 
Leave the "subject:" line blank.  Inside the message, there are 
several commands you can give.  The first line should be 
 
<PRE>
reply address
</PRE>
 
where "address" is your e-mail address. The next line should be 
 
<PRE>
connect host
</PRE>
 
where "host" is the system that has the file you want (for example: 
<B>wuarchive.wustl.edu</B>). Other commands you should consider using are 
"binary" (required for program files); "compress" (reduces the file 
size for quicker transmission) and "uuencode" (which encodes the file 
so you can do something with it when it arrives).  The last line of 
your message should be the word "quit".  
<P>
Let's say you want a copy of the U.S. constitution.  Using archie, 
you've found a file called, surprise, constitution, at the ftp site 
<B>archive.cis.ohio-state.edu</B>, in the <TT>`/pub/firearms/politics/ rkba'</TT> 
directory. You'd send a message to <TT>&lt;ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com&gt;</TT> that looks 
like this: 
 
<PRE>
reply adamg@world.std.com
connect archive.cis.ohio-state.edu
binary
compress
uuencode
get pub/firearms/politics/rkba/constitution
quit
</PRE>
 
When you get the file in your mailbox, use the above procedure 
for copying it to a file.  Run it through uudecode.  Then type 
 
<PRE>
uncompress file.name
</PRE>
 
to make it usable.
<P>
Since this was a text file, you could have changed the "binary" to 
"ascii" and then eliminated the "uuencode" file.  For programs, though, 
you'll want to keep these lines.  One caveat with ftpmail: it has become 
such a popular service that it could take a week or more for your 
requested files to arrive.
<P>
We therefore strongly encourage you to "distribute" your requests over
the currently known "ftpmail" sites:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>USA:
<DD><TT>&lt;ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com&gt;</TT>
<DT>
<DD><TT>&lt;ftpmail@sunsite.unc.edu&gt;</TT>

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - The all knowing Oracle</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_216.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_218.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC220" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC220">The all knowing Oracle</A></H2>
<P>
One other thing you can do through e-mail is consult with the
Usenet Oracle.  You can ask the Oracle anything at all and get back an
answer (whether you like the answer is another question).
<P>
First, you'll want to get instructions on how to address the Oracle 
(he, or she, or it, is very particular about such things and likes being 
addressed in august, solemn and particularly sycophantic tones).  Start 
<A NAME="IDX456"></A>
an e-mail message to 
<P>
<PRE>
oracle@iuvax.cs.indiana.edu
</PRE>
<P>
In the "Subject:" line, type
<P>
<PRE>
help
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  You don't actually have to say anything in the message 
itself -- at least not yet.  Hit control-D to send off your request 
for help.  Within a few hours, the Oracle will mail you back detailed 
instructions.  It's a fairly long file, so before you start reading 
it, turn on your communications software's logging function, to save 
it to your computer (or save the message to a file on your host system's 
home directory and then download the file).  After you've digested it, 
you can compose your question to the Oracle.  Mail it to the above 
address, only this time with a subject line that describes your 
question.  Expect an answer within a couple of days. And don't be 
surprised if you also find a question in your mailbox -- the Oracle 
extracts payment by making seekers of knowledge answer questions as 
well!
<P>
<PRE>
<EM>"If just one piece of mail gets lost, well, they'll just think they
forgot to send it.  But if *two* pieces of mail get lost, hell, they'll
just think the other guy hasn't gotten around to answering his mail.
And if *fifty* pieces of mail get lost, can you imagine it, if *fifty*
pieces of mail get lost, why they'll think someone *else* is broken!
And if 1GB of mail gets lost, they'll just *know* that Arpa is down and
think it's a conspiracy to keep them from their God given right to receive Net Mail ..."</EM>

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Clarinet UPI</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_218.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_220.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC222" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC222">Clarinet: UPI, Dave Barry and Dilbert</A></H2>
<P>
     Usenet "newsgroups" can be something of a misnomer.  They may be 
interesting, informative and educational, but they are often not news, 
at least, not the way most people would think of them. But there are several 
sources of news and sports on the Net.  
<P>
     One of the largest is Clarinet, a company in Cupertino, Calf., that 
distributes wire-service news and columns, along with a news service 
<A NAME="IDX457"></A>
<A NAME="IDX458"></A>
devoted to computers and even the Dilbert comic strip, in Usenet form.  
<P>
     Distributed in Usenet form, Clarinet stories and columns are 
organized into more than 100 newsgroups (in this case, a truly 
appropriate name), some of them with an extremely narrow focus, for 
example, <TT>clari.news.gov.taxes</TT>.  The general news and sports come from 
United Press International; the computer news from the NewsBytes 
<A NAME="IDX459"></A>
<A NAME="IDX460"></A>
<A NAME="IDX461"></A>
service; the features from several syndicates. 
<P>
     Because Clarinet charges for its service, not all host systems 
carry its articles. Those that do carry them as Usenet groups starting 
with <TT>clari.*</TT>.  As with other Usenet hierarchies, these are named starting 
with broad area and ending with more specific categories.  Some of these 
include business news (<TT>clari.biz</TT>); general national and foreign news, 
politics and the like (<TT>clari.news</TT>), sports (<TT>clari.sports</TT>); columns by 
<VAR>Mike Royko</VAR>, <VAR>Miss Manners</VAR>, <VAR>Dave Barry</VAR> and others (<TT>clari.feature</TT>); and 
NewsBytes computer and telecommunications reports (<TT>clari.nb</TT>).  Because 
Clarinet started in Canada, there is a separate set of
<TT>clari.canada</TT> 
newsgroups.  The <TT>clari.nb</TT> newsgroups are divided into specific computer 
<A NAME="IDX462"></A>
<A NAME="IDX463"></A>
<A NAME="IDX464"></A>
types (<TT>clari.nb.apple</TT>, for example).
<P>
     Clari news groups feature stories updated around the clock.  There 
are even a couple of "bulletin" newsgroups for breaking stories: 
<TT>clari.news.bulletin</TT> and <TT>clari.news.urgent</TT>.  Clarinet also sets up new 
newsgroups for breaking stories that become ongoing ones (such as major 
natural disasters, coups in large countries and the like). 
<P>
     Occasionally, you will see stories in clari newsgroups that just 
don't seem to belong there.  Stories about former Washington, D.C. mayor 
<VAR>Marion Barry</VAR>, for example, often wind interspersed among columns by
<A NAME="IDX465"></A>
<A NAME="IDX466"></A>
<VAR>Dave Barry</VAR>.
<P>
     This happens because of the way wire services work.  UPI uses 
three-letter codes to route its stories to the newspapers and radio 
stations that make up most of its clientele, and harried editors on 
deadline sometimes punch in the wrong code.

<P>
If your host system doesn't carry the clari or <TT>msen.reuters</TT> 
newsgroups, you might be able to keep up with the news a different way 
over the Net.  USA Today has been something of an online newspaper 
pioneer, selling its stories to bulletin-board and online systems across 
the country for several years.  Cleveland Free-Net provides the online 
version of USA Today (along with all its other services) for free.  
Currently, the paper only publishes five days a week, so you'll have to 
<A NAME="IDX467"></A>
<A NAME="IDX468"></A>
get your weekend news fix elsewhere. 
<P>
Telnet: <B>freenet-in-a.cwru.edu</B> or
<B>freenet-in-b.cwru.edu</B>
<P>
After you connect and log in, look for this menu entry: NPTN/USA
TODAY HEADLINE NEWS.  Type the number next to it and hit enter.  You'll
then get a menu listing a series of broad categories, such as sports and
telecommunications.  Choose one, and you'll get a yet another menu,
listing the ten most recent dates of publication.  Each of these
contains one-paragraph summaries of the day's news in that particular
subject.

Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty are American radio stations
that broadcast to the former Communist countries of eastern Europe.
Every day, their news departments prepare a summary of news in those
countries, which is then disseminated via the Net, through a Bitnet 
mailing list and a Usenet newsgroup.
<P>
To have the daily digests sent directly to your e-mailbox, send a 
<A NAME="IDX469"></A>
<A NAME="IDX470"></A>

<P>
Leave the subject line blank, and as a message, write:
<P>
<PRE>
subscribe rferl-l Your Name
</PRE>
<P>
Alternately, look for the bulletins in the Usenet newsgroup
<TT>misc.news-east-europe.rferl</TT>.
<P>
Daily Brazilian news updates are available (in Portuguese) from the
University of Sao Paulo.  Use anonymous ftp to connect to

<P>
Use <SAMP>`cd'</SAMP> to switch to the whois directory.  The news summaries are stored
in files with this form: <TT>`NEWS.23OCT92;1'</TT>.
But to get them, leave off the
semicolon and the 1, and don't capitalize anything, for example:
<P>
<PRE>
get news.23oct92

<P>
Daily summaries of news reports from France (in French) are availble 
on the National Capital FreeNet in Ottawa, Ont. Telnet to

<P>
Many Net systems provide access to a series of interactive
services that let you hold live "chats" or play online games with
people around the world.  To find out if your host system offers
these, you can ask your system administrator or just try them -- if
nothing happens, then your system does not provide them.  In general,
if you can use telnet and ftp, chances are good you can use these
services as well.

<H2><A NAME="SEC229" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC229">Talk</A></H2>
<P>
This is the Net equivalent of a telephone conversation and
requires that both you and the person you want to talk to have access
to this function and are online at the same time.  To use it, type
<P>
<PRE>
talk user@site.name
<A NAME="IDX471"></A>
<A NAME="IDX472"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
where <SAMP>`user@site.name'</SAMP> is the e-mail address of the other person.
She will see something like this on her screen: 
<P>
<PRE>
talk: connection requested by yourname@site.name
talk: respond with:  talk yourname@site.name
</PRE>
<P>
To start the conversation, she should then type (at her host system's
command line):
<P>
<PRE>
talk yourname@site.name
</PRE>
<P>
where that is your e-mail address.  Both of you will then get a top
and bottom window on your screen.  She will see everything you type in
one window; you'll see everything she types in the other.  To
disconnect, hit control-C.
<P>
One note: Public-access sites that use Sun computers sometimes have
trouble with the talk program.  If talk does not work, try typing
<SAMP>`otalk'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`ntalk'</SAMP>
instead.  However, the party at the other end will have to have the same
program online for the connection to work.

IRC is a program that lets you hold live keyboard conversations
with people around the world.  It's a lot like an international CB
radio  - it even uses "channels."  Type something on your computer and
it's instantly echoed around the world to whoever happens to be on the
same channel with you.  You can join in existing public group chats or
set up your own.  You can even create a private channel for yourself
and as few as one or two other people.  And just like on a CB radio,
you can give yourself a unique "handle" or nickname.
<P>
IRC currently links host systems in 20 different countries, from
Australia to Hong Kong to Israel.  Unfortunately, it's like telnet -- 
either your site has it or it doesn't.  If your host system does have it,  
<A NAME="IDX473"></A>
<A NAME="IDX474"></A>
Just type 
<P>
<PRE>
irc
<A NAME="IDX475"></A>
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  You'll get something like this:
<P>
<PRE>
*** Connecting to port 6667 of server world.std.com
*** Welcome to the Internet Relay Network, adamg
*** Your host is world.std.com, running version 2.7.1e+4

23:13 [1] adamg [Mail: 32] * type /help for help
</PRE>
<P>
You are now in channel 0, the "null" channel, in which you can look
up various help files, but not much else. As you can see, IRC takes over
your entire screen.  The top of the screen is where messages will
appear.  The last line is where you type IRC commands and messages.  All
IRC commands begin with a <SAMP>`/'</SAMP>.  The slash tells the computer you are about
to enter a command, rather than a message. To see what channels are
available, type
<P>
<PRE>
/list
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  You'll get something like this:
<P>
<PRE>
*** Channel    Users  Topic

<P>
Because IRC allows for a large number of channels, the list might
scroll off your screen, so you might want to turn on your computer's
screen capture to capture the entire list.  Note that the channels
always have names, instead of numbers.  Each line in the listing tells
you the channel name, the number of people currently in it, and whether
there's a specific topic for it.  To switch to a particular channel,
type
<P>
<PRE>
/join #channel
</PRE>
<P>
where <SAMP>`#channel'</SAMP> is the channel name and hit enter.  Some "public"
channels actually require an invitation from somebody already on it.  To
request an invitation, type
<P>
<PRE>
/who #channel-name
</PRE>
<P>
where <SAMP>`channel-name'</SAMP> is the name of the channel, and hit enter.  Then ask
someone with an @ next to their name if you can join in.  Note that
whenever you enter a channel, you have to include the <SAMP>`#'</SAMP>.  Choose one
with a number of users, so you can see IRC in action.
<P>
If it's a busy channel, as soon as you join it, the top of your
screen will quickly be filled with messages.  Each will start with a
person's IRC nickname, followed by his message.
<P>
It may seem awfully confusing at first.  There could be two or
three conversations going on at the same time and sometimes the
messages will come in so fast you'll wonder how you can read them all.
<P>
Eventually, though, you'll get into the rhythm of the channel and
things will begin to make more sense.  You might even want to add your
two cents (in fact, don't be surprised if a message to you shows up on
your screen right away; on some channels, newcomers are welcomed
immediately).  To enter a public message, simply type it on that bottom
line (the computer knows it's a message because you haven't started the
line with a slash) and hit enter.
<P>
Public messages have a user's nickname in brackets, like this:
<P>
<PRE>
&#60;tomg&#62;
</PRE>
<P>
If you receive a private message from somebody, his name will be
between asterisks, like this:
<P>
<PRE>
*tomg*
</PRE>
<P>
For more information on using IRC, see the IRC command box.  You
can find discussions about IRC in the <TT>alt.irc</TT> newsgroup.

<P>
Note: Hit enter after each command.
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<A NAME="IDX476"></A>
<DT><CODE>/away</CODE>
<DD>When you're called away to put out a grease fire
in the kitchen, issue this command to let others know
you're still connected but just away from your terminal
or computer for awhile.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX477"></A>
<DT><CODE>/help</CODE>
<DD>Brings up a list of commands for which there is a help
file. You will get a "topic:" prompt.  Type in the
subject for which you want information and hit enter.
Hit enter by itself to exit help.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX478"></A>
<DT><CODE>/invite</CODE>
<DD>Asks another IRC to join you in a conversation.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX479"></A>
<DT><CODE>/invite fleepo #hottub</CODE>
<DD>would send a message to fleepo asking him to join you on
the #hottub channel.  The channel name is optional.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX480"></A>
<DT><CODE>/join</CODE>
<DD>Use this to switch to or create a particular channel,
like this: <SAMP>`/join #hottub'</SAMP>
<P>
If one of these channels exists and is not a private
one, you will enter it.  Otherwise, you have just
created it. Note you have to use a <SAMP>`#'</SAMP> as the first
character.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX481"></A>
<DT><CODE>/list</CODE>
<DD>This will give you a list of all available public
channels, their topics (if any) and the number of users
currently on them.  Hidden and private channels are not
shown.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX482"></A>
<DT><CODE>/m name</CODE>
<DD>Send a private message to that user.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX483"></A>
<DT><CODE>/mode</CODE>
<DD>This lets you determine who can join a channel you've
created.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX484"></A>
<DT><CODE>/mode #channel +s</CODE>
<DD>creates a secret channel.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX485"></A>
<DT><CODE>/mode #channel +p</CODE>
<DD>makes the channel private
<P>
<A NAME="IDX486"></A>
<DT><CODE>/nick</CODE>
<DD>This lets you change the name by which others see you.
<P>
<SAMP>`/nick fleepo'</SAMP>
would change your name for the present session to
fleepo. People can still use /whois to find your e-mail
address.  If you try to enter a channel where somebody
else is already using that nickname, IRC will ask you to
select another name.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX487"></A>
<DT><CODE>/query</CODE>
<DD>This sets up a private conversation between you and
another IRC user.  To do this, type
<SAMP>`/query nickname'</SAMP>
<P>
Every message you type after that will go only to that
person.  If she then types
<SAMP>`/query nickname'</SAMP>
where nickname is yours, then you have established a
private conversation.  To exit this mode, type
<SAMP>`/query'</SAMP>
by itself.  While in query mode, you and the other
person can continue to "listen" to the discussion on
whatever public channels you were on, although neither
of you will be able to respond to any of the messages
there.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX488"></A>
<DT><CODE>/quit</CODE>
<DD>Exit IRC.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX489"></A>
<DT><CODE>/signoff</CODE>

join you on IRC. You must use the person's entire e-mail
address.
<P>
<SAMP>`/summon fleepo@foo.bar.com'</SAMP>
would send a message to fleepo asking him to start IRC.
Usually not a good idea to just summon people unless you
know they're already amenable to the idea; otherwise you
may wind up annoying them no end. This command does not
work on all sites.

<A NAME="IDX491"></A>
<DT><CODE>/topic</CODE>
<DD>When you've started a new channel, use this command to let
others know what it's about.
<P>
<SAMP>`/topic #Amiga'</SAMP>
would tell people who use /list that your channel is meant
for discussing Amiga computers.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX492"></A>
<DT><CODE>/who &#60;chan&#62;</CODE>
<DD>Shows you the e-mail address of people on a particular
channel.
<P>
<SAMP>`/who #foo'</SAMP>
would show you the addresses of everybody on channel foo.
<P>
<SAMP>`/who'</SAMP>
by itself shows you every e-mail address for every person
on IRC at the time, although be careful: on a busy night
you might get a list of 500 names!

<A NAME="IDX493"></A>
<DT><CODE>/whois</CODE>
<DD>Use this to get some information about a specific IRC

<P>
<SAMP>`/whois *'</SAMP>
will list everybody on every channel.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX494"></A>
<DT><CODE>/whowas</CODE>

IRC has become a new medium for staying on top of really big 
breaking news.  In 1993, when Russian lawmakers barricaded themselves 
inside the parliament building, some enterprising Muscovites and a couple 
of Americans set up a "news channel" on IRC to relay first-person 
accounts direct from Moscow. The channel was set up to provide a 
continuous loop of information, much like all-news radio stations that 
cycle through the day's news every 20 minutes.  In 1994, Los Angeles 
residents set up a similar channel to relay information related to the 
Northridge earthquake.  In both cases, logs of the channels were archived 
somewhere on the Net, for those unable to "tune in" live.
<P>
How would you find such channels in the future?  Use the <SAMP>`/list'</SAMP> 
command to scroll through the available channels.  If one has been set up 
to discuss a particular breaking event, chances are you'll see a brief 
description next to the channel name that will tell you that's the place 
to tune.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - MUDs</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_229.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_231.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC233" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC233">MUDs</A></H2>
<P>
Multiple-User Dimensions or Dungeons (MUDs) take IRC into the DUM
realm of fantasy.  MUDs are live, role-playing games in which you
enter assume a new identity and enter an alternate reality through
your keyboard.  As you explore this other world, through a series of
simple commands (such as "look," "go" and "take"), you'll run across
other users, who may engage you in a friendly discussion, enlist your
<A NAME="IDX495"></A>
<A NAME="IDX496"></A>
<A NAME="IDX497"></A>
aid in some quest or try to kill you for no apparent reason.
<P>
Each MUD has its own personality and creator (or God) who was
willing to put in the long hours required to establish the particular
MUD's rules, laws of nature and information databases.  Some MUDs
stress the social aspects of online communications -- users frequently
gather online to chat and join together to build new structures or
even entire realms.  Others are closer to "Dungeons and Dragons" and
are filled with sorcerers, dragons and evil people out to keep you
<A NAME="IDX498"></A>
from completing your quest -- through murder if necessary.
<P>
Many MUDs (there are also related games known as MUCKs and MUSEs)
require you to apply in advance, through e-mail, for a character name
and password.  One that lets you look around first, though, is
HoloMuck at McGill University in Montreal.  The premise of this game
is that you arrive in the middle of Tanstaafl, a city on the planet
Holo.  You have to find a place to live (else you get thrown into the
homeless shelter) and then you can begin exploring.  Magic is allowed
on this world, but only outside the city limits.  Get bored with the
city and you can roam the rest of the world or even take a trip into
orbit (of course, all this takes money; you can either wait for your
weekly salary or take a trip to the city casino).  Once you become
familiar with the city and get your own character, you can even begin
erecting your own building (or subway line, or almost anything else).
<P>
To connect, telnet to
<B>hobbes.cs.mcgill.ca 5757</B>
<P>
When you connect, type
<P>
<PRE>
connect guest guest
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  This connects you to the "guest" account, which
has a password of "guest."
You'll see this:
<P>
<PRE>
The Homeless Shelter(#22Rna)
You wake up in the town's Homeless Shelter, where vagrants are put for
protective holding.
Please don't sleep in public places-- there are plenty of
open apartments available.  Type 'apartments' to see how to get to an          
apartment building with open vacancies.                                      
There is a small sign on the wall here, with helpful information.
Type 'look sign' to read it.
The door is standing open for your return to respectable society.
Simply walk 'out' to the center.
</PRE>
<P>
Of course, you want to join respectable society, but first you
want to see what that sign says.  So you type
<P>
<PRE>
look sign
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter, which brings up a list of some basic commands.  Then
you type
<P>
<PRE>
out
</PRE>
<P>
followed by enter, which brings up this:
<P>
<PRE>
You slip out the door, and head southeast...
Tanstaafl Center
This is the center of the beautiful town of Tanstaafl.
High Street runs north and south into residential areas, while
Main Street runs east and west into business districts.
SW: is Tanstaafl Towers.
Please claim an apartment... no sleeping in public!
SE: the Public Library offers both information and entertainment.
NW: is the Homeless Shelter, formerly the Town Jail.
NE: is Town Hall, site of several important services, including: Public
Message Board, Bureau of Land Management (with maps and regulations), and
other governmental/ bureaucratic help.
Down: Below a sign marked with both red and blue large letter 'U's, a
staircase leads into an underground subway passage.
(Feel free to 'look' in any direction for more information.)
[Obvious exits: launch, d, nw, se, w, e, n, s, ne, sw]
Contents:
Instructions for newcomers
Directional signpost
Founders' statue
</PRE>
<P>
To see "Instructions for newcomers", type
<P>
<PRE>
look Instructions for newcomers
</PRE>
<P>
and hit enter.  You could do the same for "Directional signpost" and
"Founders' statue."  Then type
<P>
<PRE>
SW
</PRE>
<P>
and enter to get to Tanstaafl Towers, the city housing complex, where
you have to claim an apartment (you may have to look around; many will
already be occupied).  And now it's off to explore Holo!  One command
you'll want to keep in mind is "take." Periodically, you'll come
across items that, when you take them will confer certain abilities or
powers on you.  If you type
<P>
<PRE>
help
</PRE>
<P>
and enter, you'll get a list of files you can read to learn more about
the MUD's commands.
<P>
The "say" command lets you talk to other players publicly. For
example,
<P>
<PRE>
say Hey, I'm here!
</PRE>
<P>
would be broadcast to everybody else in the room with you.  If you
want to talk to just one particular person, use "whisper" instead of
"say."
<P>
<PRE>
whisper agora=Hey, I'm here!
</PRE>
<P>
would be heard only by agora.  Another way to communicate with
somebody regardless of where on the world they are is through your
pager.  If you suddenly see yours go off while visiting, chances are
it's a wizard checking to see if you need any help.  To read his
<A NAME="IDX499"></A>
message, type
<P>
<PRE>
page
</PRE>
<P>
To send him a message, type
<P>
<PRE>
page name=message
</PRE>
<P>
where name is the wizard's name (it'll be in the original message).
<P>
Other MUDs and MUCKs may have different commands, but generally
use the same basic idea of letting you navigate through relatively
simple English commands.
<P>
When you connect to a MUD, choose your password as carefully as
you would one for your host system; alas, there are MUD crackers who
enjoy trying to break into other people's MUD accounts.  And never,
never use the same password as the one you use on your host system!
<P>
MUDs can prove highly addicting.  "The jury is still out on
whether MUDding is 'just a game'  or 'an extension of real life with
gamelike qualities'," says <VAR>Jennifer Smith</VAR>, an active MUD player who
<A NAME="IDX500"></A>
wrote an FAQ on the subject.
<P>
She adds one caution: "You shouldn't do anything that you
wouldn't do in real life, even if the world is a fantasy world.  The
important thing to remember is that it's the fantasy world of possibly
hundreds of people, and not just yours in  particular.  There's a
human being on the other side of each and every wire!  Always remember
that you may meet these other people some day,  and they may break
your nose.  People who treat others badly gradually build up bad
reputations and eventually receive the NO FUN Stamp of Disapproval."

<P>
All is not fun and games on the Net.  Like any community, the Net
has its share of obnoxious characters who seem to exist only to make
your life miserable (you've already met some of them in section <A HREF="bdg_64.html#SEC67">Usenet: the Global Watering Hole</A>).
There are people who seem to spend a bit more time on the Net than many 
would find healthy.  It also has its criminals.  <VAR>Clifford Stoll</VAR> writes in 
<I>The Cuckoo's Egg</I> how he tracked a team of German hackers who were 
breaking into U.S. computers and selling the information they found to 
the Soviets.  <VAR>Robert Morris</VAR>, a Cornell University student, was convicted 
of unleashing a "worm" program that effectively disabled several thousand 
<A NAME="IDX501"></A>
<A NAME="IDX502"></A>
<A NAME="IDX503"></A>
computers connected to the Internet.  
<P>
Of more immediate concern to the average Net user are crackers
who seek to find other's passwords to break into Net systems and people
who infect programs on ftp sites with viruses.
<P>
There is a widely available program known as "Crack" that can
decipher user passwords composed of words that might be found in a
dictionary (this is why you shouldn't use such passwords).  Short of
that, there are the annoying types who take a special thrill in trying to 
make you miserable.  The best advice in dealing with them is to count to 
10 and then ignore them -- like juveniles everywhere, most of their fun 
comes in seeing how upset you can get. 
<P>
Meanwhile, two Cornell University students pleaded guilty in 1992 to
uploading virus-infected Macintosh programs to ftp sites.  If you plan
to try out large amounts of software from ftp sites, it might be wise to
download or buy a good anti-viral program.
<P>
But can law enforcement go too far in seeking out the criminals?
The Electronic Frontier Foundation was founded in large part in
response to a series of government raids against an alleged gang of
hackers.  The raids resulted in the near bankruptcy of one game
company never alleged to have had anything to do with the hackers,
when the government seized its computers and refused to give them
back.  The case against another alleged participant collapsed in court
when his attorney showed the "proprietary" and supposedly hacked
information he printed in an electronic newsletter was actually
available via an 800 number for about $13 -- from the phone company
from which that data was taken.

<H2><A NAME="SEC238" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC238">The Net in the Classroom</A></H2>
<P>
If you're a teacher, you've probably already begun to see the
potential the Net has for use in the class.  Usenet, ftp and telnet have
tremendous educational potential, from keeping up with world events to
arranging international science experiments.
<P>
Because the Net now reaches so many countries and often stays
online even when the phones go down, you and your students can  "tune
in" to first-hand accounts during international conflicts.  Look at
your system's list of Usenet <TT>soc.culture.*</TT> groups to see if
there is one
about the country or region you're interested in.  Even in peacetime,
these newsgroups can be great places to find people from countries you
might be studying.
<P>
The biggest problem may be getting accounts for your students, if
you're not lucky enough to live within the local calling area of a
Free-Net system. Many colleges and universities, however, are willing
to discuss providing accounts for secondary students at little or no
cost.  Several states, including California and Texas, have
Internet-linked networks for teachers and students.
<P>
In addition, there are a number of resources on the Internet aimed
specifically at elementary and secondary students and teachers.  You
can use these to set up science experiments with classes in another
country, learn how to use computers in the classroom or keep up with the
latest advances in teaching everything from physics to physical
education.
<P>

Begun on the Fidonet hobbyist network, K12Net is now also
carried on many Usenet systems and provides a host of interesting and
valuable services.  These include international chat for students,
foreign-language discussions (for example, there are French and
German-only conference where American students can practice those languages
with students from Quebec and German).  There are also conferences aimed
at teachers of specific subjects, from physical education to physics.
The K12 network still has limited distribution, so ask your
<A NAME="IDX509"></A>
<A NAME="IDX510"></A>
system administrator if your system carries it.

AskERIC provides a way for educators, librarians and 
others interested in K-12 education to get more 
information about virtually everything.  The center 
maintains an e-mail address (<TT>&lt;askeric@ericir.syr.edu&gt;</TT>) for 
questions and promises answers within 48 hours.  It also 
maintains a gopher site that contains digests of 
questions and answers, lesson plans in a variety of 
fields and other educationally related information.  The

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - SpaceMet</TITLE>

<H3><A NAME="SEC242" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC242">SpaceMet</A></H3>
If your system doesn't carry K12, but has access to
telnet, you can reach it through SpaceMet Forum, a bulletin-board system
aimed at teachers and students that is run by the physics and astronomy
department at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.  The address
is <B>spacemet.phast.umass.edu</B>.  When you connect, hit escape once.
Like K12, SpaceMet Forum began as a Fidonet system, but has since
grown much larger.  Mort and Helen Sternheim, professors at the
university, started SpaceMet as a one-line bulletin-board system several
years ago to help bolster middle-school science education in nearby
<A NAME="IDX512"></A>
towns.
<P>
Today, there is a whole series of satellite SpaceMet BBSs in
western Massachusetts and SpaceMet itself is now linked to Fidonet and
Internet.
<P>
In addition to the K12 conferences, SpaceMet carries numerous
educationally oriented conferences.  It also has a large file library of
interest to educators and students, but be aware that getting files to
your site could be difficult and maybe even impossible.  Unlike most
other Internet sites, Spacemet does not use an ftp interface. The
Sternheims say ZMODEM sometimes works over the network, but don't count
on it.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Usenet and Bitnet in the Classroom</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_248.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_250.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC252" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC252">Usenet and Bitnet in the Classroom</A></H2>
There are numerous Usenet newsgroups of potential interest to
teachers and students (see section <A HREF="bdg_64.html#SEC67">Usenet: the Global Watering Hole</A>).
<P>
As you might expect, many are of a scientific bent. You can find
these by typing <SAMP>`l sci.'</SAMP> in rn or using <SAMP>`nngrep sci.'</SAMP> for nn.
There are now
close to 40, with subjects ranging from archaeology to economics (the
"dismal science," remember?) to astronomy to nanotechnology (the
construction of microscopically small machines).
<P>
One thing students will quickly learn from many of these groups:
science is not just dull, boring facts.  Science is argument and
standing your ground and making your case.  The Usenet <TT>sci.*</TT> groups
encourage critical thinking.
<P>
Beyond science, social-studies and history classes can keep busy
learning about other countries, through the <TT>soc.culture.*</TT> newsgroups.
<P>
Most of these newsgroups originated as ways for expatriates of a
given country to keep in touch with their homeland and its culture.  In
times of crisis, however, these groups often become places to
disseminate information from or into the country and to discuss what is
happening.  From Afghanistan to Yugoslavia, close to 50 countries are
now represented on Usenet.
To see which groups are available, use <SAMP>`l soc.culture.'</SAMP> in rn or
<SAMP>`nngrep soc.culture.'</SAMP> for nn.
<P>
One caveat:  Teachers might want to peruse particular newsgroups 
before setting their students loose in them.  Some have higher levels of 
flaming and blather than others.
<P>
Several "talk" newsgroups provide additional topical discussions,
but teachers should screen them first before recommending them to
students.  They range from <TT>talk.abortion</TT>, via
<TT>talk.politics. guns</TT> to
<A NAME="IDX519"></A>
<TT>talk.politics.space</TT>, and <TT>talk.environment</TT>.
<P>
There are also a number of Bitnet discussion groups of potential
interest to students and teachers.
See section <A HREF="bdg_86.html#SEC89">Mailing Lists and Bitnet</A>
for information on
finding and subscribing to Bitnet discussion groups.  Some with an
educational orientation include:

<H2><A NAME="SEC255" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC255">Setting Up Shop</A></H2>
<P>
Back in olden days, oh, before 1990 or so, there were no markets in 
the virtual community -- if you wanted to buy a book, you still had to 
jump in your car and drive to the nearest bookstore.
<P>
This was because in those days, the Net consisted mainly of a series 
of government-funded networks on which explicit commercial activity was 
forbidden.  Today, much of the Net is run by private companies, which 
generally have no such restrictions, and a number of companies have begun 
experimenting with online "shops" or other services.  Many of these shops 
are run by booksellers, while the services range from delivery of indexed 
copies of federal documents to an online newsstand that hopes to entice 
you to subscribe to any of several publications (of the printed on paper 
variety).  A number of companies also use Usenet newsgroups (in the biz 
hierarchy) to distribute press releases and product information.
<P>
Still, commercial activity on the remains far below that found on 
other networks, such as CompuServe, with its Electronic Mall, or Prodigy, 
with its advertisements on almost every screen.  In part that's because 
of the newness and complexity of the Internet as a commercial medium.  In 
part, however, that is because of security concerns.  Companies worry 
about such issues as crackers getting into their system over the network, 
and many people do not like the idea of sending a credit-card number via 
the Internet (an e-mail message could be routed through several sites to 
get to its destination).  These concerns could disappear as Net users 
turn to such means as message encryption and "digital signatures." In the 
meantime, however, businesses on the Net can still consider themselves 
<A NAME="IDX521"></A>
<A NAME="IDX522"></A>
something of Internet pioneers. 
<P>
A couple of public-access sites and a regional network have set up 
"marketplaces" for online businesses. 
<P>
The World in Brookline, Mass., currently rents "space" to several 
bookstores and computer-programming firms, as well as an "adult toy 
shop."  To browse their offerings, use gopher to connect to
<P>
<PRE>
world.std.com
</PRE>
<P>
At the main menu, select "Shops on the World."
<P>
Msen in Ann Arbor provides its "Msen Marketplace," where you'll find 
a travel agency and an "Online Career Center" offering help-wanted ads 
from across the country.  Msen also provides an "Internet Business 
Pages," an online directory of companies seeking to reach the Internet 
community.  You can reach Msen through gopher at 
<P>
<PRE>
gopher.msen.com
</PRE>
<P>
At the main menu, select "Msen Marketplace."
<P>
The Nova Scotia Technology Network runs a "Cybermarket" on its 
gopher service at
<P>
<PRE>
nstn.ns.ca
</PRE>
<P>
There, you'll find an online bookstore that lets you order books through 
e-mail (to which you'll have to trust your credit-card number) and a 
similar "virtual record store." Both let you search their wares by 
keyword or by browsing through catalogs.
<P>
Other online businesses include:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>AnyWare Associates
<DD>This Boston company runs an Internet-to-fax
gateway that lets you send fax message anywhere
in the world via the Internet (for a fee, of 
course).  For more information, write
<TT>&lt;sales@awa.com&gt;</TT>
<P>
<DT>Bookstacks Unlimited
<DD>This Cleveland bookstore offers a keyword-searchable
database of thousands of books for sale.  
Telnet: <B>books.com</B>
<P>
<DT>Counterpoint Publishing
<DD>Based in Cambridge, Mass., this company's main
Internet product is indexed versions of federal
journals, including the Federal Register (a daily
compendium of government contracts, proposed 
regulations and the like).  Internet users can
browse through recent copies, but complete access
will run several thousand dollars a year.  Use
gopher to connect to <B>enews.com</B>
and select "Counterpoint Publishing"
<P>
<DT>Dialog
<DD>The national database company can be reached 
through telnet at <B>dialog.com</B>.
To log on, however, you will have first had to
set up a Dialog account.
<P>
<DT>Dow Jones News Retrieval
<DD>A wire service run by the information company
that owns the Wall Street Journal.  Available
via telnet at <B>djnr.dowjones.com</B>.
As with Dialog, you need an account to log on.
<P>
<DT>Infinity Link
<DD>Browse book, music, software, video-cassette and
laser-disk catalogs through this system based in
Malvern, Penn.  Use gopher to connect to
<B>columbia.ilc.com</B>. Log on as: <SAMP>`cas'</SAMP>
<P>
<DT>The Internet Company
<DD>Sort of a service bureau, this company, based in
Cambridge, Mass., is working with several publishers
on Internet-related products.  Its Electronic
Newsstand offers snippets and special 
subscription rates to a number of national 
magazines, from the New Republic to the New 
Yorker.  Use gopher to connect to
<B>enews.com</B>
<P>
<DT>MarketBase
<DD>You can try the classified-ads system developed
by this company in Santa Barbara, Calif., by 
gopher to connect to <B>mb.com</B>.
<P>
<DT>O'Reilly and Associates
<DD>Best known for its "Nutshell" books on Unix, 
O'Reilly runs three Internet services.  The gopher
server, at <B>ora.com</B>
provides information about the company and its
books.  It posts similar information in the
<TT>biz.oreilly.announce</TT> Usenet newsgroup.  Its 
Global Network Navigator, accessible through the 
World-Wide Web, is a sort of online magazine that 
lets users browse through interesting services 
and catalogs.

<H1><A NAME="SEC257" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC257">"Conclusion: the End?" by Adam Gaffin</A></H1>
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC=logos/bdgtti.gif>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX523"></A>
<EM>The revolution is just beginning.</EM>
<P>
New communications systems and digital technologies have already
meant dramatic changes in the way we live.  Think of what is already
routine that would have been considered impossible just ten years ago.
You can browse through the holdings of your local library -- or of
libraries halfway around the world -- do your banking and see if your
neighbor has gone bankrupt, all through a computer and modem.
<P>
Imploding costs coupled with exploding power are bringing ever
more powerful computer and digital systems to ever growing numbers of
people.  The Net, with its rapidly expanding collection of databases
and other information sources, is no longer limited to the
industrialized nations of the West; today the web extends into once
remote areas from Siberia to Zimbabwe. The cost of computers and
modems used to plug into the Net, meanwhile, continue to plummet,
making them ever more affordable.
<P>
Cyberspace has become a vital part of millions of people's daily
lives. People form relationships online, they fall in love, they get
married, all because of initial contacts in cyberspace, that ephemeral
"place" that transcends national and state boundaries. Business
deals are transacted entirely in ASCII.  Political and social
movements begin online, coordinated by people who could be thousands
<A NAME="IDX524"></A>
of miles apart.
<P>
<EM>Yet this is only the beginning.</EM>
<P>
We live in an age of communication, yet, the various media we use
to talk to one another remain largely separate systems. One day,
however, your telephone, TV, fax machine and personal computer will be
replaced by a single "information processor" linked to the worldwide
Net by strands of optical fiber.
<P>
Beyond databases and file libraries, power will be at your
fingertips. Linked to thousands, even millions of like-minded people,
you'll be able to participate in social and political movements across
the country and around the world.
<P>
How does this happen? In part, it will come about through new
technologies. High-definition television will require the development
of inexpensive computers that can process as much information as
today's workstations.  Telephone and cable companies will compete to
see who can bring those fiber-optic cables into your home first.  
High-speed data networks, such as the Internet, will be replaced by even more
powerful systems.
<P>
The Clinton administration, arguably the first led by people who 
know how to use not only computer networks but computers, is pushing for 
creation of a series of "information superhighways" comparable in scope 
to the Interstate highway system of the 1950s (one of whose champions in 
<A NAME="IDX525"></A>
<A NAME="IDX526"></A>
the Senate has a son elected vice president in 1992).    
<P>
Right now, we are in the network equivalent of the early 1950s, 
just before the creation of that massive highway network. Sure, there are 
plenty of interesting things out there, but you have to meander along 
two-lane roads, and have a good map, to get to them. 
<P>
Creation of this new Net will also require a new communications
paradigm: the Net as information utility.  The Net remains a somewhat
complicated and mysterious place.  To get something out of the Net
today, you have to spend a fair amount of time with a Net veteran or a
manual like this.  You have to learn such arcana as the vagaries of the
Unix cd command.
<P>
Contrast this with the telephone, which now also provides access to
large amounts of information through push buttons, or a computer network
such as Prodigy, which one navigates through simple commands and mouse
<A NAME="IDX527"></A>
clicks.
<P>
Internet system administrators have begun to realize that not all 
people want to learn the intricacies of Unix, and that that fact does 
not make them bad people.  We are already seeing the development of 
simple interfaces that will put the Net's power to use by millions of 
people.  You can already see their influence in the menus of gophers and 
the World-Wide Web, which require no complex computing skills but which 
open the gates to thousands of information resources.  Mail programs and 
text editors such as Pico and Pine promise much of the power of older 
<A NAME="IDX528"></A>
<A NAME="IDX529"></A>
<A NAME="IDX530"></A>
programs such as emacs at a fraction of the complexity. 
<P>
Some software engineers are looking at taking this even further, by
creating graphical interfaces that will let somebody navigate the
Internet just by clicking on the screen with a mouse or by calling up an
easy text editor, sort of the way one can now navigate a Macintosh
computer -- or a commercial online service such as Prodigy.
<P>
<EM>Then there are the Internet services themselves.</EM>
<P>
For every database now available through the Internet, there are
probably three or four that are not.  Government agencies are only
slowly beginning to connect their storehouses of information to the
Net. Several commercial vendors, from database services to booksellers,
have made their services available through the Net.
<P>
Few people now use one of the Net's more interesting
applications.  A standard known as MIME lets one send audio and
graphics files in a message.  Imagine opening your e-mail one day to hear
your granddaughter's first words, or a "photo" of your friend's new
house.  Eventually, this standard could allow for distribution of even
<A NAME="IDX531"></A>
small video displays over the Net.
<P>
All of this will require vast new amounts of Net power, to handle
both the millions of new people who will jump onto the Net and the new
applications they want.  Replicating a moving image on a computer screen
alone takes a phenomenal amount of computer bits, and computing power to
arrange them.
<P>
All of this combines into a National Information Infrastructure able 
to move billions of bits of information in one second -- the kind of 
<A NAME="IDX532"></A>
power needed to hook information "hoses" into every business and house.
<P>
As these "superhighways" grow, so will the "on ramps," for a high-speed
road does you little good if you can't get to it.   The costs of 
modems seem to fall as fast as those of computers.  High-speed modems 
<A NAME="IDX533"></A>
(9600 baud and up) are becoming increasingly affordable.  At 9600 baud,
you can download a satellite weather image of North America in less than 
two minutes, a file that, with a slower modem could take up to 20 
minutes to download.  Eventually, homes could be connected directly to a 
national digital network.  Most long-distance phone traffic is already 
carried in digital form, through high-volume optical fibers.  Phone 
companies are ever so slowly working to extend these fibers the "final 
mile" to the home.  The Electronic Frontier Foundation is working to 
ensure these links are affordable. 
<P>
Beyond the technical questions are increasingly thorny social,
political and economic issues. Who is to have access to these
services, and at what cost?  If we live in an information age, are we
laying the seeds for a new information under class, unable to compete
with those fortunate enough to have the money and skills needed to
manipulate new communications channels? Who, in fact, decides who has
access to what?  As more companies realize the potential profits to be
made in the new information infrastructure, what happens to such
systems as Usenet, possibly the world's first successful anarchistic
system, where everybody can say whatever they want?
<P>
What are the laws of the electronic frontier?  When national and
state boundaries lose their meaning in cyberspace,  the question might
even be: WHO is the law?  What if a practice that is legal in one
country is "committed" in another country where it is illegal, over a
computer network that crosses through a third country? Who goes after
computer crackers?

    I'm a writer, so I spend a lot of time alone in a room with my words
and my thoughts. On occasion, I venture outside to interview people or
to find information. After work, I reenter the human community, via my
family, my neighborhood, my circle of acquaintances. But that regime
left me feeling isolated and lonely during the working day, with few
opportunities to expand my circle of friends. For the past seven years,
however, I have participated in a wide-ranging, intellectually
stimulating, professionally rewarding, sometimes painful, and often
intensely emotional ongoing interchange with dozens of new friends,
hundreds of colleagues, thousands of acquaintances. And I still spend
many of my days in a room, physically isolated. My mind, however, is
linked with a worldwide collection of like-minded (and not so like-minded)
souls: My virtual community.
<P>
    Virtual communities emerged from a surprising intersection of
humanity and technology. When the ubiquity of the world
telecommunications network is combined with the information-structuring
and storing capabilities of computers, a new communication medium
becomes possible. As we've learned from the history of the telephone,
radio, television, people can adopt new communication media and redesign
their way of life with surprising rapidity. Computers, modems, and
communication networks furnish the technological infrastructure of
computer-mediated communication (CMC); cyberspace is the conceptual
space where words and human relationships, data and wealth and power are
manifested by people using CMC technology; virtual communities are
cultural aggregations that emerge when enough people bump into each
<A NAME="IDX534"></A>
other often enough in cyberspace.
<P>
    A virtual community as they exist today is a group of people who may 
or may not meet one another face to face, and who exchange words and 
ideas through the mediation of computer bulletin boards and networks. In 
cyberspace, we chat and argue, engage in intellectual intercourse, 
perform acts of commerce, exchange knowledge, share emotional support, 
make plans, brainstorm, gossip, feud, fall in love, find friends and 
lose them, play games and metagames, flirt, create a little high art and 
a lot of idle talk. We do everything people do when people get together, 
but we do it with words on computer screens, leaving our bodies behind. 
Millions of us have already built communities where our identities 
commingle and interact electronically, independent of local time or 
location. The way a few of us live now might be the way a larger 
population will live, decades hence. 
<P>
    The pioneers are still out there exploring the frontier, the borders 
of the domain have yet to be determined, or even the shape of it, or the 
best way to find one's way in it. But people are using the technology of 
computer-mediated communications CMC technology to do things with each 
other that weren't possible before. Human behavior in cyberspace, as we 
can observe it and participate in it today, is going to be a crucially 
important factor. The ways in which people use CMC always will be rooted 
in human needs, not hardware or software. 
<P>
    If the use of virtual communities turns out to answer a deep and 
compelling need in people, and not just snag onto a human foible like 
pinball or pac-man, today's small online enclaves may grow into much 
larger networks over the next twenty years. The potential for social 
change is a side-effect of the trajectory of telecommunications and 
computer industries, as it can be forecast for the next ten years. This 
odd social revolution -- communities of people who may never or rarely 
meet face to face -- might piggyback on the technologies that the 
biggest telecommunication companies already are planning to install over 
the next ten years. 
<P>
    It is possible that the hardware and software of a new global 
telecommunications infrastructure, orders of magnitude more powerful 
than today's state of the art, now moving from the laboratories to the 
market, will expand the reach of this spaceless place throughout the 
1990s to a much wider population than today's hackers, technologists, 
scholars, students, and enthusiasts. The age of the online pioneers will 
end soon, and the cyberspace settlers will come en-masse. Telecommuters 
who might have thought they were just working from home and avoiding one 
day of gridlock on the freeway will find themselves drawn into a whole 
new society. Students and scientists are already there, artists have 
made significant inroads, librarians and educators have their own 
pioneers as well, and political activists of all stripes have just begun 
to discover the power of plugging a computer into a telephone. When 
today's millions become tens and hundreds of millions, perhaps billions, 
what kind of place, and what kind of model for human behavior will they 
find? 
<P>
    Today's bedroom electronic bulletin boards, regional computer 
conferencing systems, global computer networks offer clues to what might 
happen when more powerful enabling technology comes along. The hardware 
for amplifying the computing and communication capacity of every home on 
the world-grid is in the pipeline, although the ultimate applications 
are not yet clear. We'll be able to transfer the Library of Congress 
from any point on the globe to any another point in seconds, upload and 
download full-motion digital video at will. But is that really what 
people are likely to do with all that bandwidth and computing power? 
Some of the answers have to come from the behavioral rather than the 
technological part of the system. How will people actually use the 
desktop supercomputers and multimedia telephones that the engineers tell 
us we'll have in the near future. 
<P>
    One possibility is that people are going to do what people always do 
with a new communication technology: use it in ways never intended or 
foreseen by its inventors, to turn old social codes inside out and make 
new kinds of communities possible. CMC will change us, and change our 
culture, the way telephones and televisions and cheap video cameras 
changed us -- by altering the way we perceive and communicate. Virtual 
communities transformed my life profoundly, years ago, and continue to 
do so.

<P>
    The most important clues to the shape of the future at this point 
might not be found in looking more closely at the properties of silicon, 
but in paying attention to the ways people need to, fail to, and try to 
communicate with one another. Right now, some people are convinced that 
spending hours a day in front of a screen, typing on a keyboard, 
fulfills in some way our need for a community of peers. Whether we have 
discovered something wonderful or stumbled into something insidiously 
unwonderful, or both, the fact that people want to use CMC to meet other 
people and experiment with identity are valuable signposts to possible 
futures. Human behavior in cyberspace, as we can observe it today on the 
nets and in the BBSs, gives rise to important questions about the 
effects of communication technology on human values. What kinds of 
humans are we becoming in an increasingly computer-mediated world, and 
do we have any control over that transformation? How have our 
definitions of "human" and "community" been under pressure to change to 
fit the specifications of a technology-guided civilization? 
<P>
    Fortunately, questions about the nature of virtual communities are 
not purely theoretical, for there is a readily accessible example of the 
phenomenon at hand to study. Millions of people now inhabit the social 
spaces that have grown up on the world's computer networks, and this 
previously invisible global subculture has been growing at a monstrous 
rate recently (e.g., the Internet growing by 25% per month). 
<P>
    I've lived here myself for seven years; the WELL and the net have 
been a regular part of my routine, like gardening on Sunday, for one 
sixth of my life thus far. My wife and daughter long ago grew accustomed 
to the fact that I sit in front of my computer early in the morning and 
late at night, chuckling and cursing, sometimes crying, about something 
I am reading on the computer screen. The questions I raise here are not 
those of a scientist, or of a polemicist who has found an answer to 
something, but as a user -- a nearly obsessive user -- of CMC and a deep 
mucker-about in virtual communities. What kind of people are my friends 
and I becoming? What does that portend for others? 
<P>
    If CMC has a potential, it is in the way people in so many parts of 
the net fiercely defend the use of the term "community" to describe the 
relationships we have built online. But fierceness of belief is not 
sufficient evidence that the belief is sound. Is the aura of community 
an illusion? The question has not been answered, and is worth asking. 
I've seen people hurt by interactions in virtual communities. Is 
telecommunication culture capable of becoming something more than what 
Scott Peck calls a "pseudo-community," where people lack the genuine 
personal commitments to one another that form the bedrock of genuine 
community? Or is our notion of "genuine" changing in an age where more 
people every day live their lives in increasingly artificial 
environments? New technologies tend to change old ways of doing things. 
Is the human need for community going to be the next technology 
commodity? 
<P>
    I can attest that I and thousands of other cybernauts know that what 
we are looking for, and finding in some surprising ways, is not just 
information, but instant access to ongoing relationships with a large 
number of other people. Individuals find friends and groups find shared 
identities online, through the aggregated networks of relationships and 
commitments that make any community possible. But are relationships and 
commitments as we know them even possible in a place where identities 
are fluid? The physical world, known variously as "IRL" ("In Real 
Life"), or "offline," is a place where the identity and position of the 
people you communicate with are well known, fixed, and highly visual. In 
cyberspace, everybody is in the dark. We can only exchange words with 
each other -- no glances or shrugs or ironic smiles. Even the nuances of 
voice and intonation are stripped away. On top of the technology-imposed 
constraints, we who populate cyberspace deliberately experiment with 
fracturing traditional notions of identity by living as multiple 
simultaneous personae in different virtual neighborhoods. 
<P>
    We reduce and encode our identities as words on a screen, decode and 
unpack the identities of others. The way we use these words, the stories 
(true and false) we tell about ourselves (or about the identity we want 
people to believe us to be) is what determines our identities in 
cyberspace. The aggregation of personae, interacting with each other, 
determines the nature of the collective culture. Our personae, 
constructed from our stories of who we are, use the overt topics of 
discussion in a BBS or network for a more fundamental purpose, as means 
of interacting with each other. And all this takes place on both public 
and private levels, in many-to-many open discussions and one-to-one 
private electronic mail, front stage role-playing and backstage 
behavior. 
<P>
    When I'm online, I cruise through my conferences, reading and 
replying in topics that I've been following, starting my own topics when 
the inspiration or need strikes me. Every few minutes, I get a notice on 
my screen that I have incoming mail. I might decide to wait to read the 
mail until I'm finished doing something else, or drop from the 
conference into the mailer, to see who it is from. At the same time that 
I am participating in open discussion in conferences and private 
discourse in electronic mail, people I know well use "sends" -- a means 
of sending one or two quick sentences to my screen without the 
intervention of an electronic mail message. This can be irritating 
before you get used to it, since you are either reading or writing 
something else when it happens, but eventually it becomes a kind of 
rhythm: different degrees of thoughtfulness and formality happen 
simultaneously, along with the simultaneous multiple personae. Then 
there are public and private conferences that have partially overlapping 
memberships. CMC offers tools for facilitating all the various ways 
people have discovered to divide and communicate, group and subgroup and 
regroup, include and exclude, select and elect. 
<P>
    When a group of people remain in communication with one another for 
extended periods of time, the question of whether it is a community 
arises. Virtual communities might be real communities, they might be 
pseudocommunities, or they might be something entirely new in the realm 
of social contracts, but I believe they are in part a response to the 
hunger for community that has followed the disintegration of traditional 
communities around the world. 
<P>
    Social norms and shared mental models have not emerged yet, so 
everyone's sense of what kind of place cyberspace is can vary widely, 
which makes it hard to tell whether the person you are communicating 
with shares the same model of the system within which you are 
communicating. Indeed, the online acronym YMMV ("Your Mileage May Vary") 
has become shorthand for this kind of indeterminacy of shared context. 
For example, I know people who use vicious online verbal combat as a way 
of blowing off steam from the pressures of their real life -- "sport 
hassling" -- and others who use it voyeuristically, as a text-based form 
of real-life soap-opera. To some people, it's a game. And I know people 
who feel as passionately committed to our virtual community and the 
people in it (or at least some of the people in it) as our nation, 
occupation, or neighborhood. Whether we like it or not, the 
communitarians and the venters, the builders and the vandals, the 
egalitarians and the passive-aggressives, are all in this place 
together. The diversity of the communicating population is one of the 
defining characteristics of the new medium, one of its chief 
attractions, the source of many of its most vexing problems. 
<P>
    Is the prospect of moving en-masse into cyberspace in the near 
future, when the world's communication network undergoes explosive 
expansion of bandwidth, a beneficial thing for entire populations to do? 
In which ways might the growth of virtual communities promote 
alienation? How might virtual communities facilitate conviviality? Which 
social structures will dissolve, which political forces will arise, and 
which will lose power? These are questions worth asking now, while there 
is still time to shape the future of the medium. In the sense that we 
are traveling blind into a technology-shaped future that might be very 
different from today's culture, direct reports from life in different 
corners of the world's online cultures today might furnish valuable 
signposts to the territory ahead. 
<P>
    Since the summer of 1985, I've spent an average of two hours a day, 
seven days a week, often when I travel, plugged into the WELL (Whole 
Earth 'Lectronic Link) via a computer and a telephone line, exchanging 
information and playing with attention, becoming entangled In Real Life, 
with a growing network of similarly wired-in strangers I met in 
cyberspace. I remember the first time I walked into a room full of 
people (IRL) whose faces were completely unknown to me, but who knew 
many intimate details of my history, and whose own stories I knew very 
well. I had contended with these people, shot the breeze around the 
electronic water cooler, shared alliances and formed bonds, fallen off 
my chair laughing with them, become livid with anger at these people, 
but I had not before seen their faces. 
<P>
    I found this digital watering hole for information-age hunters and 
gatherers the same way most people find such places -- I was lonely, 
hungry for intellectual and emotional companionship, although I didn't 
know it. While many commuters dream of working at home, telecommuting, I 
happen to know what it's like to work that way. I never could stand to 
commute or even get out of my pajamas if I didn't want to, so I've 
always worked at home. It has its advantages and its disadvantages. 
Others like myself also have been drawn into the online world because 
they shared with me the occupational hazard of the self-employed,
home-based symbolic analyst of the 1990s -- isolation. The kind of people 
that Robert Reich calls "symbolic analysts" are natural matches for 
online communities: programmers, writers, freelance artists and 
designers, independent radio and television producers, editors, 
researchers, librarians. People who know what to do with symbols, 
abstractions, and representations, but who sometimes find themselves 
spending more time with keyboards and screens than human companions. 
<P>
    I've learned that virtual communities are very much like other 
communities in some ways, deceptively so to those who assume that people 
who communicate via words on a screen are in some way aberrant in their 
communication skills and human needs. And I've learned that virtual 
communities are very much not like communities in some other ways, 
deceptively so to those who assume that people who communicate via words 
on a screen necessarily share the same level of commitment to each other 
in real life as more traditional communities. Communities can emerge 
from and exist within computer-linked groups, but that technical linkage 
of electronic personae is not sufficient to create a community.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Social Contracts</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_256.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_258.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC260" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC260">Social Contracts, Reciprocity, and Gift Economies in Cyberspace</A></H2>
<P>
    The network of communications that constitutes a virtual community 
can include the exchange of information as a kind of commodity, and the 
economic implications of this phenomenon are significant; the ultimate 
social potential of the network, however, lies not solely in its utility 
as an information market, but in the individual and group relationships 
that can happen over time. When such a group accumulates a sufficient 
number of friendships and rivalries, and witnesses the births, 
marriages, and deaths that bond any other kind of community, it takes on 
a definite and profound sense of place in people's minds. Virtual 
communities usually have a geographically local focus, and often have a 
connection to a much wider domain. The local focus of my virtual 
community, the WELL, is the San Francisco Bay Area; the wider locus 
consists of hundreds of thousands of other sites around the world, and 
millions of other communitarians, linked via exchanges of messages into 
a meta-community known as "the net." 
<P>
    The existence of computer-linked communities was predicted twenty 
years ago by <VAR>J.C.R. Licklider</VAR> and <VAR>Robert Taylor</VAR>, who as research 
directors for the Department of Defense, set in motion the research that 
resulted in the creation of the first such community, the ARPAnet: "What 
will on-line interactive communities be like?" Licklider and Taylor 
wrote, in 1968: "In most fields they will consist of geographically 
separated members, sometimes grouped in small clusters and sometimes 
working individually. They will be communities not of common location, 
but of common interest..." 
<P>
    My friends and I sometimes believe we are part of the future that 
Licklider dreamed about, and we often can attest to the truth of his 
prediction that "life will be happier for the on-line individual because 
the people with whom one interacts most strongly will be selected more 
by commonality of interests and goals than by accidents of proximity." I 
still believe that, but I also know that life also has turned out to be 
unhappy at times, intensely so in some circumstances, because of words 
on a screen. Events in cyberspace can have concrete effects in real 
life, of both the pleasant and less pleasant varieties. Participating in 
a virtual community has not solved all of life's problems for me, but it 
has served as an aid, a comfort and an inspiration at times; at other 
times, it has been like an endless, ugly, long-simmering family brawl. 
<P>
    I've changed my mind about a lot of aspects of the WELL over the 
years, but the "sense of place" is still as strong as ever. As Ray 
Oldenburg revealed in "The Great Good Place," there are three essential 
places in every person's life: the place they live, the place they work, 
and the place they gather for conviviality. Although the casual 
conversation that takes place in cafes, beauty shops, pubs, town squares 
is universally considered to be trivial, "idle talk," Oldenburg makes 
the case that such places are where communities can arise and hold 
together. When the automobile-centric, suburban, high-rise, fast food, 
shopping mall way of life eliminated many of these "third places," the 
social fabric of existing communities shredded. It might not be the same 
kind of place that Oldenburg had in mind, but so many of his 
descriptions of "third places" could also describe the WELL. 
<P>
    The feeling of logging into the WELL for just a minute or two, 
dozens of times a day is very similar to the feeling of peeking into the 
cafe, the pub, the common room, to see who's there, and whether you want 
to stay around for a chat. Indeed, in all the hundreds of thousands of 
computer systems around the world that use the UNIX operating system, as 
does the WELL, the most widely used command is the one that shows you 
who is online. Another widely used command is the one that shows you a 
particular user's biography. 
<P>
    I visit the WELL both for the sheer pleasure of communicating with 
my newfound friends, and for its value as a practical instrument 
for gathering information on subjects that are of momentary or enduring 
importance, from child care to neuroscience, technical questions on 
telecommunications to arguments on philosophical, political, or 
spiritual subjects. It's a bit like a neighborhood pub or coffee shop. 
It's a little like a salon, where I can participate in a hundred ongoing 
conversations with people who don't care what I look like or sound like, 
but who do care how I think and communicate. There are seminars and word 
fights in different corners. And it's all a little like a groupmind, 
where questions are answered, support is given, inspiration is provided, 
by people I may have never heard from before, and whom I may never meet 
face to face.  
<P>
    Because we cannot see one another, we are unable to form prejudices 
about others before we read what they have to say: Race, gender, age, 
national origin and physical appearance are not apparent unless a person 
wants to make such characteristics public. People who are thoughtful but 
who are not quick to formulate a reply often do better in CMC than face 
to face or over the telephone. People whose physical handicaps make it 
difficult to form new friendships find that virtual communities treat 
them as they always wanted to be treated -- as thinkers and transmitters 
of ideas and feeling beings, not carnal vessels with a certain 
appearance and way of walking and talking (or not walking and not 
talking). Don't mistake this filtration of appearances for 
dehumanization: Words on a screen are quite capable of moving one to 
laughter or tears, of evoking anger or compassion, of creating a 
community from a collection of strangers. 
<P>
    From my informal research into virtual communities around the world, 
I have found that enthusiastic members of virtual communities in Japan, 
England, and the US agree that "increasing the diversity of their circle 
of friends" was one of the most important advantages of computer 
conferencing. CMC is a way to meet people, whether or not you feel the 
need to affiliate with them on a community level, but the way you meet 
them has an interesting twist: In traditional kinds of communities, we 
are accustomed to meeting people, then getting to know them; in virtual 
communities, you can get to know people and then choose to meet them. In 
some cases, you can get to know people who you might never meet on the 
physical plane. 
<P>
    How does anybody find friends? In the traditional community, we 
search through our pool of neighbors and professional colleagues, of 
acquaintances and acquaintances of acquaintances, in order to find 
people who share our values and interests. We then exchange information 
about one another, disclose and discuss our mutual interests, and 
sometimes we become friends. In a virtual community we can go directly 
to the place where our favorite subjects are being discussed, then get 
acquainted with those who share our passions, or who use words in a way 
we find attractive. In this sense, the topic is the address: You can't 
simply pick up a phone and ask to be connected with someone who wants to 
talk about Islamic art or California wine, or someone with a three year 
old daughter or a 30 year old Hudson; you can, however, join a computer 
conference on any of those topics, then open a public or private 
correspondence with the previously-unknown people you find in that 
conference. You will find that your chances of making friends are 
magnified by orders of magnitude over the old methods of finding a peer 
group. 
<P>
    You can be fooled about people in cyberspace, behind the cloak of 
words. But that can be said about telephones or face to face 
communications, as well; computer-mediated communications provide new 
ways to fool people, and the most obvious identity-swindles will die out 
only when enough people learn to use the medium critically. Sara Kiesler 
noted that the word "phony" is an artifact of the early years of the 
telephone, when media-naive people were conned by slick talkers in ways 
that wouldn't deceive an eight-year old with a cellular phone today. 
<P>
    There is both an intellectual and an emotional component to CMC. 
Since so many members of virtual communities are the kind of
knowledge-based professionals whose professional standing can be enhanced
by what they know, virtual communities can be practical, cold-blooded 
instruments. Virtual communities can help their members cope with 
information overload. The problem with the information age, especially 
for students and knowledge workers who spend their time immersed in the 
info-flow, is that there is too much information available and no 
effective filters for sifting the key data that are useful and 
interesting to us as individuals. Programmers are trying to design 
better and better "software agents" that can seek and sift, filter and 
find, and save us from the awful feeling one gets when it turns out that 
the specific knowledge one needs is buried in 15,000 pages of related 
information. 
<P>
    The first software agents are now becoming available (e.g., WAIS, 
Rosebud), but we already have far more sophisticated, if informal, 
social contracts among groups of people that allow us to act as software 
agents for one another. If, in my wanderings through information space, 
I come across items that don't interest me but which I know one of my 
worldwide loose-knit affinity group of online friends would appreciate, 
I send the appropriate friend a pointer, or simply forward the entire 
text (one of the new powers of CMC is the ability to publish and 
converse with the same medium). In some cases, I can put the information 
in exactly the right place for 10,000 people I don't know, but who are 
intensely interested in that specific topic, to find it when they need 
it. And sometimes, 10,000 people I don't know do the same thing for me. 
<P>
    This unwritten, unspoken social contract, a blend of strong-tie and 
weak-tie relationships among people who have a mixture of motives, 
requires one to give something, and enables one to receive something. I 
have to keep my friends in mind and send them pointers instead of 
throwing my informational discards into the virtual scrap-heap. It 
doesn't take a great deal of energy to do that, since I have to sift 
that information anyway in order to find the knowledge I seek for my own 
purposes; it takes two keystrokes to delete the information, three 
keystrokes to forward it to someone else. And with scores of other 
people who have an eye out for my interests while they explore sectors 
of the information space that I normally wouldn't frequent, I find that 
the help I receive far outweighs the energy I expend helping others: A 
marriage of altruism and self-interest. 
<P>
    The first time I learned about that particular cyberspace power was 
early in the history of the WELL, when I was invited to join a panel of 
experts who advise the U.S. Congress Office of Technology Assessment 
(OTA). The subject of the assessment was "Communication Systems for an 
Information Age." I'm not an expert in telecommunication technology or 
policy, but I do know where to find a group of such experts, and how to 
get them to tell me what they know. Before I went to Washington for my 
first panel meeting, I opened a conference in the WELL and invited 
assorted information-freaks, technophiles, and communication experts to 
help me come up with something to say. An amazing collection of minds 
flocked to that topic, and some of them created whole new communities 
when they collided. 
<P>
    By the time I sat down with the captains of industry, government 
advisers, and academic experts at the panel table, I had over 200 pages 
of expert advice from my own panel. I wouldn't have been able to 
integrate that much knowledge of my subject in an entire academic or 
industrial career, and it only took me (and my virtual community) a few 
minutes a day for six weeks. I have found the WELL to be an outright 
magical resource, professionally. An editor or producer or client can 
call and ask me if I know much about the Constitution, or fiber optics, 
or intellectual property. "Let me get back to you in twenty minutes," I 
say, reaching for the modem. In terms of the way I learned to use the 
WELL to get the right piece of information at the right time, I'd say 
that the hours I've spent putting information into the WELL turned out 
to be the most lucrative professional investments I've ever made. 
<P>
    The same strategy of nurturing and making use of loose
information-sharing affiliations across the net can be applied to an infinite
domain 
of problem areas, from literary criticism to software evaluation. It's a 
neat way for a sufficiently large, sufficiently diverse group of people 
to multiply their individual degree of expertise, and I think it could 
be done even if the people aren't involved in a community other than 
their company or their research specialty. I think it works better when 
the community's conceptual model of itself is more like barn-raising 
than horse-trading, though. Reciprocity is a key element of any
market-based culture, but the arrangement I'm describing feels to me more like 
a kind of gift economy where people do things for one another out of a 
spirit of building something between them, rather than a
spreadsheet-calculated quid pro quo. When that spirit exists, everybody gets a 
little extra something, a little sparkle, from their more practical 
transactions; different kinds of things become possible when this 
mindset pervades. Conversely, people who have valuable things to add to 
the mix tend to keep their heads down and their ideas to themselves when 
a mercenary or hostile zeitgeist dominates an online community. 
<P>
    I think one key difference between straightforward workaday 
reciprocity is that in the virtual community I know best, one valuable 
currency is knowledge, elegantly presented. Wit and use of language are 
rewarded in this medium, which is biased toward those who learn how to 
manipulate attention and emotion with the written word. Sometimes, you 
give one person more information than you would give another person in 
response to the same query, simply because you recognize one of them to 
be more generous or funny or to-the-point or agreeable to your political 
convictions than the other one. 
<P>
    If you give useful information freely, without demanding
tightly-coupled reciprocity, your requests for information are met more swiftly, 
in greater detail, than they would have been otherwise. The person  you 
help might never be in a position to help you, but someone else might 
be. That's why it is hard to distinguish idle talk from serious
context-setting. In a virtual community, idle talk is context-setting. Idle talk 
is where people learn what kind of person you are, why you should be 
trusted or mistrusted, what interests you. An agora is more than the 
site of transactions; it is also a place where people meet and size up 
one another. 
<P>
    A market depends on the quality of knowledge held by the 
participants, the buyers and sellers, about price and availability and a 
thousand other things that influence business; a market that has a forum 
for informal and back-channel communications is a better-informed 
market. The London Stock Exchange grew out of the informal transactions 
in a coffee-house; when it became the London International Stock 
Exchange a few years ago, and abolished the trading-room floor, the 
enterprise lost something vital in the transition from an old room where 
all the old boys met and cut their deals to the screens of thousands of 
workstations scattered around the world. 
<P>
    The context of the informal community of knowledge sharers grew to 
include years of both professional and personal relationships. It is not 
news that the right network of people can serve as an inquiry research 
system: You throw out the question, and somebody on the net knows the 
answer. You can make a game out of it, where you gain symbolic prestige 
among your virtual peers by knowing the answer. And you can make a game 
out of it among a group of people who have dropped out of their orthodox 
professional lives, where some of them sell these information services 
for exorbitant rates, in order to participate voluntarily in the virtual 
community game. 
<P>
    When the WELL was young and growing more slowly than it is now, such 
knowledge-potlatching had a kind of naively enthusiastic energy. When 
you extend the conversation -- several dozen different characters,
well-known to one another from four or five years of virtual hanging-out, 
several hours a day -- it gets richer, but not necessarily "happier." 
<P>
    Virtual communities have several drawbacks in comparison to
face-to-face communication, disadvantages that must be kept in mind if you are 
to make use of the power of these computer-mediated discussion groups. 
The filtration factor that prevents one from knowing the race or age of 
another participant also prevents people from communicating the facial 
expressions, body language, and tone of voice that constitute the 
inaudible but vital component of most face to face communications. 
Irony, sarcasm, compassion, and other subtle but all-important nuances 
that aren't conveyed in words alone are lost when all you can see of a 
person are words on a screen. 
<P>
    It's amazing how the ambiguity of words in the absence of body 
language inevitably leads to online misunderstandings. And since the 
physical absence of other people also seems to loosen some of the social 
bonds that prevent people from insulting one another in person, 
misunderstandings can grow into truly nasty stuff before anybody has a 
chance to untangle the original miscommunication. Heated diatribes and 
interpersonal incivility that wouldn't crop up often in face to face or 
even telephone discourse seem to appear with relative frequency in 
computer conferences. The only presently available antidote to this flaw 
of CMC as a human communication medium is widespread knowledge of this 
flaw -- aka "netiquette." 
<P>
    Online civility and how to deal with breaches of it is a topic unto 
itself, and has been much-argued on the WELL. Degrees of outright 
incivility constitute entire universes such as alt.flame, the Usenet 
newsgroup where people go specifically to spend their days hurling vile 
imprecations at one another. I am beginning to suspect that the most 
powerful and effective defense an online community has in the face of 
those who are bent on disruption might be norms and agreements about 
withdrawing attention from those who can't abide by even loose rules of 
verbal behavior. "If you continue doing that," I remember someone saying 
to a particularly persistent would-be disrupter, "we will stop paying 
attention to you." This is technically easy to do on Usenet, where 
putting the name of a person or topic header in a "kill file" (aka "bozo 
filter") means you will never see future contributions from that person 
or about that topic. You can simply choose to not see any postings from 
Rich Rosen, or that feature the word "abortion" in the title. A society 
in which people can remove one another, or even entire topics of 
discussion, from visibility. The WELL does not have a bozo filter, 
although the need for one is a topic of frequent discussion.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - Who Is The WELL?</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_257.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_259.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC261" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC261">Who Is The WELL?</A></H2>
<P>
    One way to know what the WELL is like is to know something about the 
kind of people who use it. It has roots in the San Francisco Bay Area, 
and in two separate cultural revolutions that took place there in past 
<A NAME="IDX535"></A>
decades. The Whole Earth Catalog originally emerged from the 
counterculture as Stewart Brand's way of providing access to tools and 
ideas to all the communes who were exploring alternate ways of life in 
the forests of Mendocino or the high deserts outside Santa Fe. The Whole 
Earth Catalogs and the magazines they spawned, Co-Evolution Quarterly 
and Whole Earth Review, have outlived the counterculture itself, since 
they are still alive and raising hell after nearly 25 years. For many 
years, the people who have been exploring alternatives and are open to 
ideas that you don't find in the mass media have found themselves in 
cities instead of rural communes, where their need for new tools and 
ideas didn't go away. 
<P>
    The Whole Earth Catalog crew received a large advance in the
mid-1980s to produce an updated version, a project involving many 
geographically-separated authors and editors, many of whom were using 
computers. They bought a minicomputer and the license to Picospan, a 
computer conferencing program, leased an office next to the magazine's 
office, leased incoming telephone lines, set up modems, and the WELL was 
born in 1985. The idea from the beginning was that the founders weren't 
sure what the WELL would become, but they would provide tools for people 
to build it into something useful. It was consciously a cultural 
experiment, and the business was designed to succeed or fail on the 
basis of the results of the experiment. The person Stewart Brand chose 
to be the WELL's first director -- technician, manager, innkeeper, and 
bouncer -- was Matthew McClure, not-coincidentally a computer-savvy 
veteran of The Farm, one of the most successful of the communes that 
started in the sixties. Brand and McClure started a low-rules, high-tone 
discussion, where savvy networkers, futurists, misfits who had learned 
how to make our outsiderness work for us, could take the technology of 
CMC to its cultural limits. 
<P>
<A NAME="IDX536"></A>
    The Whole Earth network -- the granola-eating utopians, the solar-power
enthusiasts, serious ecologists and the space-station crowd, 
immortalists, Biospherians, environmentalists, social activists -- was 
part of the core population from the beginning. But there were a couple 
of other key elements. One was the subculture that happened ten years 
after the counterculture era -- the personal computer revolution. 
Personal computers and the PC industry were created by young iconoclasts 
who wanted to have whizzy tools and change the world. Whole Earth had 
honored them, including the outlaws among them, with the early Hacker's 
Conferences. The young computer wizards, and the grizzled old hands who 
were still messing with mainframes, showed up early at the WELL because 
the guts of the system itself -- the UNIX operating system and "C" 
language programming code -- were available for tinkering by responsible 
craftsmen. 
<P>
    A third cultural element that made up the initial mix of the WELL, 
which has drifted from its counterculture origins in many ways, were the 
deadheads. Books and theses have been written about the subculture that 
have grown up around the band, the Grateful Dead. The deadheads have a 
strong feeling of community, but they can only manifest it en masse when 
the band has concerts. They were a community looking for a place to 
happen when several technology-savvy deadheads started a "Grateful Dead 
Conference" on the WELL. GD was so phenomenally successful that for the 
first several years, deadheads were by far the single largest source of 
income for the enterprise. 
<P>
    Along with the other elements came the first marathon swimmers in 
the new currents of the information streams, the futurists and writers 
and journalists. The New York Times, Business Week, the San Francisco 
Chronicle, Time, Rolling Stone, Byte, the Wall Street Journal all have 
journalists that I know personally who drop into the WELL as a listening 
post. People in Silicon Valley lurk to hear loose talk among the pros. 
Journalists tend to attract other journalists, and the purpose of 
journalists is to attract everybody else: most people have to use an old 
medium to hear news about the arrival of a new medium. 
<P>
    Things changed, both rapidly and slowly, in the WELL. There were 
about 600 members of the WELL when I joined, in the summer of 1985. It 
seemed that then, as now, the usual ten percent of the members did 80% 
of the talking. Now there are about 6000 people, with a net gain of 
about a hundred a month. There do seem to be more women than other parts 
of cyberspace. Most of the people I meet seem to be white or Asian; 
African-Americans aren't missing, but they aren't conspicuous or even 
visible. If you can fake it, gender and age are invisible, too. I'd 
guess the WELL consists of about 80% men, 20% women. I don't know 
whether formal demographics would be the kind of thing that most WELL 
users would want to contribute to. It's certainly something we'd 
discuss, argue, debate, joke about. 
<P>
    One important social rule was built into Picospan, the software that 
the WELL lives inside: Nobody is anonymous. Everybody is required to 
attach their real "userid" to their postings. It is possible to use 
pseudonyms to create alternate identities, or to carry metamessages, but 
the pseudonyms are always linked in every posting to the real userid. So 
individual personae -- whether or not they correspond closely to the 
real person who owns the account -- are responsible for the words they 
post. In fact, the first several years, the screen that you saw when you 
reached the WELL said "You own your own words." Stewart Brand, the 
WELL's co-founder likes epigrams: "Whole Earth," "Information wants to 
be free." "You own your own words." Like the best epigrams, "You own 
your own words" is open to multiple interpretations. The matter of 
responsibility and ownership of words is one of the topics WELLbeings 
argue about endlessly, so much that the phrase has been abbreviated to 
"YOYOW," As in, "Oh no, another YOYOW debate." 
<P>
    Who are the WELL members, and what do they talk about? I can tell 
you about the individuals I have come to know over six years, but the 
WELL has long since been something larger than the sum of everybody's 
friends. The characteristics of the pool of people who tune into this 
electronic listening post, whether or not they every post a word in 
public, is a strong determinant of the flavor of the "place." There's a 
cross-sectional feeling of "who are we?" that transcends the 
intersecting and non-intersecting rings of friends and acquaintances 
each individual develops.

<TITLE>Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet - My Neighborhood On The WELL</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_258.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_260.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC262" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC262">My Neighborhood On The WELL</A></H2>
<P>
    Every CMC system gives users tools for creating their own sense of 
place, by customizing the way they navigate through the database of 
conferences, topics, and responses. A conference or newsgroup is like a 
place you go. If you go to several different places in a fixed order, it 
seems to reinforce the feeling of place by creating a customized 
neighborhood that is also shared by others. You see some of the same 
users in different parts of the same neighborhood. Some faces, you see 
only in one context -- the parents conference, the Grateful Dead tours 
conference, the politics or sex conference. 
<P>
    My home neighborhood on the WELL is reflected in my ".cflist," the 
file that records my preferences about the order of conferences I visit. 
It is always possible to go to any conference with a command, but with a 
<TT>`.cflist'</TT> you structure your online time by going from conference to 
specified conference at regular intervals, reading and perhaps 
responding in several ongoing threads in several different places. 
That's the part of the art of discourse where I have found that the 
computer adds value to the intellectual activity of discussing formally 
distinct subjects asynchronously, from different parts of the world, 
over extending periods, by enabling groups to structure conversations by 
topic, over time. 
<P>
    My <TT>`.cflist'</TT> starts, for sentimental reasons, with the Mind 
conference, the first one I hosted on the WELL, since 1985. I've changed 
my <TT>`.cflist'</TT> hundreds of times over the years, to add or delete 
conferences from my regular neighborhood, but I've always kept Mind in 
the lead. The entry banner screen for the Mind conference used to 
display to each user the exact phase of the moon in numbers and ASCII 
graphics every time they logged in to the conference. But the volunteer 
programmer who had created the "phoon" program had decided to withdraw 
it, years later, in a dispute with WELL management. There is often a 
technological fix to a social problem within this particular universe. 
Because the WELL seems to be an intersection of many different cultures, 
there have been many experiments with software tools to ameliorate 
problems that seemed to crop up between people, whether because of the 
nature of the medium or the nature of the people. A frighteningly 
expensive pool of talent was donated by volunteer programmers to create 
tools and even weapons for WELL users to deal with each other. People 
keep giving things to the WELL, and taking them away. Offline readers 
and online tools by volunteer programmers gave others increased power to 
<A NAME="IDX537"></A>
communicate. 
<P>
    The News conference is what's next. This is the commons, the place 
where the most people visit the most often, where the most outrageous 
off-topic proliferation is least pernicious, where the important 
announcements about the system or social events or major disputes or new 
conferences are announced. When an earthquake or fire happens, News is 
where you want to go. Immediately after the 1989 earthquake and during 
the Oakland fire of 1991, the WELL was a place to check the damage to 
the local geographic community, lend help to those who need it, and get 
first-hand reports. During Tienamen square, the Gulf War, the Soviet 
Coup, the WELL was a media-funnel, with snippets of email from Tel-Aviv 
and entire newsgroups fed by fax machines in China, erupting in News 
conference topics that grew into fast-moving conferences of their own. 
During any major crisis in the real world, the routine at our house is 
to turn on CNN and log into the WELL. 
<P>
    After News is Hosts, where the hottest stuff usually happens. The 
hosts community is a story in itself. The success of the WELL in its 
first five years, all would agree, rested heavily on the efforts of the 
conference hosts -- online characters who had created the character of 
the first neighborhoods and kept the juice flowing between one another 
all over the WELL, but most pointedly in the Hosts conference. Some 
spicy reading in the Archives conference originated from old hosts' 
disputes - and substantial arguments about the implications of CMC for 
civil rights, intellectual property, censorship, by a lot of people who 
know what they are talking about, mixed liberally with a lot of other 
people who don't know what they are talking about, but love to talk 
anyway, via keyboard and screen, for years on end. 
<P>
    In this virtual place, the pillars of the community and the worst 
offenders of public sensibilities are in the same group -- the hosts. At 
their best and their worst, this ten percent of the online population 
put out the words that the other ninety percent keep paying to read. 
Like good hosts at any social gathering, they make newcomers welcome, 
keep the conversation flowing, mediate disputes, clean up messes, and 
throw out miscreants, if need be. A WELL host is part salon keeper, part 
saloon keeper, part talk-show host, part publisher. The only power to 
censor or to ban a user is the hosts' power. Policy varies from host to 
host, and that's the only policy. The only justice for those who misuse 
that power is the forced participation in weeks of debilitating and 
vituperative post-mortem. 
<P>
    The hosts community is part long-running soap opera, part town 
meeting, bar-room brawl, anarchic debating society, creative groupmind, 
bloody arena, union hall, playpen, encounter group. The Hosts conference 
is extremely general, from technical questions to personal attacks. The 
Policy conference is supposed to be restricted to matters of what WELL 
policy is, or ought to be. The part-delusion, part-accurate perception 
that the hosts and other users have strong influence over WELL policy is 
part of what feeds debate here, and a strong element in the libertarian 
reputation of the stereotypical WELLite. After fighting my way through a 
day's or hour's worth of the Hot New Dispute in News, Hosts, and Policy, 
I check on the conferences I host -- Info, Virtual Communities, Virtual 
Reality. After that my <TT>`.cflist'</TT> directs me, at the press of the return 
key, to the first new topic or response in the Parenting, Writers', 
Grateful Dead tours, Telecommunication, Macintosh, Weird, Electronic 
Frontier Foundation, Whole Earth, Books, Media, Men on the WELL, 
Miscellaneous, and Unclear conferences. 
<P>
    The social dynamics of the WELL spawn new conferences in response to 
different kinds of pressures. Whenever a hot interpersonal or doctrinal 
issue breaks out, for example, people want to stage the brawl or make a 
dramatic farewell speech or shocking disclosure or serious accusation in 
the most heavily-visited area of the WELL, which is usually the place 
that others want to be a Commons -- a place where people from different 
sub-communities can come to find out what is going on around the WELL, 
outside the WELL, where they can pose questions to the committee of the 
whole. When too many discussions of what the WELL's official policy 
ought to be, about censorship or intellectual property or the way people 
treat each other, break out, they tended to clutter the place people 
went to get a quick sense of what is happening outside their 
neighborhoods. So the Policy conference was born. 
<P>
    But then the WELL grew larger and it wasn't just policy but 
governance and social issues like political correctness or the right of 
users to determine the social rules of the system. Several years and six 
thousand more users after the fission of the News and Policy 
conferences, another conference split off News -- "MetaWELL,"  a 
conference was created strictly to discussions about the WELL itself, its 
nature, its situation (often dire), its future. 
<P>
    Grabbing attention in the Commons is a powerful act. Some people 
seem drawn to performing there; others burst out there in acts of 
desperation, after one history of frustration or another. Dealing with 
people who are so consistently off-topic or apparently deeply grooved 
into incoherence, long-windedness, scatology, is one of the events that 
challenges a community to decide what its values really are, or ought to 
be. 
<P>
    Something is happening here. I'm not sure anybody understands it 
yet. I know that the WELL and the net is an important part of my life 
and I have to decide for myself whether this is a new way to make 
genuine commitments to other human beings, or a silicon-induced illusion 
of community. I urge others to help pursue that question in a variety of 
ways, while we have the time. The political dimensions of CMC might lead 
to situations that would pre-empt questions of other social effects; 
responses to the need for understanding the power-relationships inherent 
in CMC are well represented by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and 
others. We need to learn a lot more, very quickly, about what kind of 
place our minds are homesteading. 
<P>
    The future of virtual communities is connected to the future of 
everything else, starting with the most precious thing people have to 
gain or lose -- political freedom. The part played by communication 
technologies in the disintegration of communism, the way broadcast 
television pre-empted the American electoral process, the power of fax 
and CMC networks during times of political repression like Tienamen 
Square and the Soviet Coup attempt, the power of citizen electronic 
journalism, the power-maneuvering of law enforcement and intelligence 
agencies to restrict rights of citizen access and expression in 
cyberspace, all point to the future of CMC as a close correlate of 
future political scenarios. More important than civilizing cyberspace is 
ensuring its freedom as a citizen-to-citizen communication and 
publication medium; laws that infringe equity of access to and freedom 
of expression in cyberspace could transform today's populist empowerment 
into yet another instrument of manipulation. Will "electronic democracy" 
be an accurate description of political empowerment that grows out of 
the screen of a computer? Or will it become a brilliant piece of 
disinfotainment, another means of manipulating emotions and 
manufacturing public opinion in the service of power. 
<P>
    Who controls what kinds of information is communicated in the 
international networks where virtual communities live? Who censors, and 
what is censored? Who safeguards the privacy of individuals in the face 
of technologies that make it possible to amass and retrieve detailed 
personal information about every member of a large population? The 
answers to these political questions might make moot any more abstract 
questions about cultures in cyberspace. Democracy itself depends on the 
relatively free flow of communications. The following words by James 
Madison are carved in marble at the United States Library of Congress: 
"A popular government without popular information, or the means of 
acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy, or perhaps 
both. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance, and a people who mean to 
be their own governors must arm themselves with the power which 
knowledge gives." It is time for people to arm themselves with power 
about the future of CMC technology. 
<P>
    Who controls the market for relationships? Will the world's 
increasingly interlinked, increasingly powerful, decreasingly costly 
communications infrastructure be controlled by a small number of very 
large companies? Will cyberspace be privatized and parceled out to those 
who can afford to buy into the auction? If political forces do not seize 
the high ground and end today's freewheeling exchange of ideas, it is 
still possible for a more benevolent form of economic control to stunt 
the evolution of virtual communities, if a small number of companies 
gain the power to put up toll-roads in the information networks, and 
smaller companies are not able to compete with them. 
<P>
    Or will there be an open market, in which newcomers like Apple or 
Microsoft can become industry leaders? The playing field in the global 
telecommunications industry will never be level, but the degree of 
individual freedom available through telecommunication technologies in 
the future may depend upon whether the market for goods and services in 
cyberspace remains open for new companies to create new uses for CMC. 
<P>
    I present these observations as a set of questions, not as answers. 
I believe that we need to try to understand the nature of CMC, 
cyberspace, and virtual communities in every important context -- 
politically, economically, socially, culturally, cognitively. Each 
different perspective reveals something that the other perspectives do 
not reveal. Each different discipline fails to see something that 
another discipline sees very well. We need to think as teams here, 
across boundaries of academic discipline, industrial affiliation, 
nation, to understand, and thus perhaps regain control of, the way human 
communities are being transformed by communication technologies. We 
can't do this solely as dispassionate observers, although there is 
certainly a huge need for the detached assessment of social science. But 
community is a matter of the heart and the gut as well as the head. Some 
of the most important learning will always have to be done by jumping 
into one corner or another of cyberspace, living there, and getting up 
to your elbows in the problems that virtual communities face.

<A NAME="IDX538"></A>
(Reprinted from SCIENCE FICTION EYE #10 with permission of the author.)
<P>
I just wrote my first nonfiction book. It's called THE HACKER CRACKDOWN:
LAW AND DISORDER ON THE ELECTRONIC FRONTIER. Writing this book has
required me to spend much of the past year and a half in the company of
<A NAME="IDX539"></A>
<A NAME="IDX540"></A>
<A NAME="IDX541"></A>
hackers, cops, and civil libertarians.
<P>
I've spent much time listening to arguments over what's legal, what's
illegal, what's right and wrong, what's decent and what's despicable,
what's moral and immoral, in the world of computers and civil liberties.
My various informants were knowledgeable people who cared passionately
about these issues, and most of them seemed well-intentioned.
Considered as a whole, however, their opinions were a baffling mess of
contradictions.
<P>
When I started this project, my ignorance of the issues involved was
genuine and profound. I'd never knowingly met anyone from the computer
underground. I'd never logged-on to an underground bulletin-board or
read a semi-legal hacker magazine. Although I did care a great deal
about the issue of freedom of expression, I knew sadly little about the
history of civil rights in America or the legal doctrines that surround
freedom of the press, freedom of speech, and freedom of association. My
relations with the police were firmly based on the stratagem of avoiding
personal contact with police to the greatest extent possible.
<P>
I didn't go looking for this project. This project came looking for me.
I became inextricably involved when agents of the United States Secret
Service, acting under the guidance of federal attorneys from Chicago,
came to my home town of Austin on March 1, 1990, and confiscated the
computers of a local science fiction gaming publisher.  <VAR>Steve Jackson</VAR>
Games, Inc., of Austin, was about to publish a gaming-book called GURPS
<A NAME="IDX542"></A>
Cyberpunk.
<P>
When the federal law-enforcement agents discovered the electronic
manuscript of CYBERPUNK on the computers they had seized from Mr.
Jackson's offices, they expressed grave shock and alarm. They declared
that CYBERPUNK was "a manual for computer crime."
<P>
It's not my intention to reprise the story of the Jackson case in this
column. I've done that to the best of my ability in THE HACKER
CRACKDOWN; and in any case the ramifications of March 1 are far from
over. Mr. Jackson was never charged with any crime. His civil suit
against the raiders is still in federal court as I write this.
<P>
I don't want to repeat here what some cops believe, what some hackers
believe, or what some civil libertarians believe. Instead, I want to
discuss my own moral beliefs as a science fiction writer -- such as they
are. As an SF writer, I want to attempt a personal statement of
principle.
<P>
It has not escaped my attention that there are many people who believe
that anyone called a "cyberpunk" must be, almost by definition, entirely
devoid of principle. I offer as evidence an excerpt from <VAR>Buck
BloomBecker</VAR>'s 1990 book, SPECTACULAR COMPUTER CRIMES. On page 53, in a
chapter titled "Who Are The Computer Criminals?", Mr. BloomBecker
<A NAME="IDX543"></A>
introduces the formal classification of "cyberpunk" criminality.
<P>
"In the last few years, a new genre of science fiction has arisen under
the evocative name of 'cyberpunk.' Introduced in the work of <VAR>William
Gibson</VAR>, particularly in his prize-winning novel NEUROMANCER, cyberpunk
takes an apocalyptic view of the technological future. In NEUROMANCER,
the protagonist is a futuristic hacker who must use the most
sophisticated computer strategies to commit crimes for people who offer
him enough money to buy the biological creations he needs to survive.
His life is one of cynical despair, fueled by the desire to avoid death.
Though none of the virus cases actually seen so far have been so
devastating, this book certainly represents an attitude that should be
watched for when we find new cases of computer virus and try to
<A NAME="IDX544"></A>
understand the motivations behind them."
<P>
"The New York Times's <VAR>John Markoff</VAR>, one of the more perceptive and
accomplished writers in the field, has written that a number of computer
criminals demonstrate new levels of meanness. He characterizes them, as
<A NAME="IDX545"></A>
do I, as cyberpunks."
<P>
Those of us who have read Gibson's NEUROMANCER closely will be aware of
certain factual inaccuracies in Mr. BloomBecker's brief review.
NEUROMANCER is not "apocalyptic." The chief conspirator in NEUROMANCER
forces Case's loyalty, not by buying his services, but by planting
poison-sacs in his brain. Case is "fueled" not by his greed for money or
"biological creations," or even by the cynical "desire to avoid death,"
but rather by his burning desire to hack cyberspace. And so forth.
<P>
However, I don't think this misreading of NEUROMANCER is based on
carelessness or malice. The rest of Mr. BloomBecker's book generally is
informative, well-organized, and thoughtful. Instead, I feel that Mr.
BloomBecker manfully absorbed as much of NEUROMANCER as he could without
suffering a mental toxic reaction. This report of his is what he
actually <EM>saw</EM> when reading the novel.
<P>
NEUROMANCER has won quite a following in the world of computer crime
investigation. A prominent law enforcement official once told me that
police unfailingly conclude the worst when they find a teenager with a
computer and a copy of NEUROMANCER. When I declared that I too was a
"cyberpunk" writer, she asked me if I would print the recipe for a
pipe-bomb in my works. I was astonished by this question, which struck
me as bizarre rhetorical excess at the time. That was before I had
actually examined bulletin-boards in the computer underground, which I
found to be chock-a-block with recipes for pipe-bombs, and worse. (I
didn't have the heart to tell her that my friend and colleague <VAR>Walter
Jon Williams</VAR> had once written and published an SF story closely
<A NAME="IDX546"></A>
<A NAME="IDX547"></A>
<A NAME="IDX548"></A>
describing explosives derived from simple household chemicals.)
<P>
Cyberpunk SF (along with SF in general) has, in fact, permeated the
computer underground. I have met young underground hackers who use the
aliases "Neuromancer," "Wintermute" and "Count Zero." The Legion of
Doom, the absolute bete noire of computer law-enforcement, used to
congregate on a bulletin-board called "Black Ice."
<P>
In the past, I didn't know much about anyone in the underground, but
they certainly knew about me. Since that time, I've had people express
sincere admiration for my novels, and then, in almost the same breath,
brag to me about breaking into hospital computers to chortle over
confidential medical reports about herpes victims.
<P>
The single most stinging example of this syndrome is "<VAR>Pengo</VAR>," a member
of the German hacker-group that broke into Internet computers while in
the pay of the KGB. He told German police, and the judge at the trial of
his co-conspirators, that he was inspired by NEUROMANCER and <VAR>John
<A NAME="IDX549"></A>
<A NAME="IDX550"></A>
<A NAME="IDX551"></A>
<A NAME="IDX552"></A>
<A NAME="IDX553"></A>
Brunner</VAR>'s SHOCKWAVE RIDER.
<P>
I didn't write NEUROMANCER. I did, however, read it in manuscript and
offered many purportedly helpful comments. I praised the book publicly
and repeatedly and at length. I've done everything I can to get people
to read this book.
<P>
I don't recall cautioning Gibson that his novel might lead to anarchist
hackers selling their expertise to the ferocious and repulsive apparat
that gave the world the Lubyanka and the Gulag Archipelago. I don't
think I could have issued any such caution, even if I'd felt the danger
of such a possibility, which I didn't. I still don't know in what
fashion Gibson might have changed his book to avoid inciting evildoers,
while still retaining the integrity of his vision -- the very quality
about the book that makes it compelling and worthwhile.
<P>
<EM>This leads me to my first statements of moral principle.</EM>
<P>
As a "cyberpunk" SF writer, I am not responsible for every act committed
by a Bohemian with a computer. I don't own the word "cyberpunk" and
cannot help where it is bestowed, or who uses it, or to what ends.
<P>
As a science fiction writer, it is not my business to make people
behave. It is my business to make people imagine. I cannot control other
people's imaginations -- any more than I would allow them to control
mine.
<P>
I am, however, morally obliged to speak out when acts of evil are
committed that use my ideas or my rhetoric, however distantly, as a
justification.
<P>
Pengo and his friends committed a grave crime that was worthy of
condemnation and punishment. They were clever, but treacherously clever.
They were imaginative, but it was imagination in a bad cause.  They were
technically accomplished, but they abused their expertise for illicit
profit and to feed their egos. They may be "cyberpunks" -- according to
many, they may deserve that title far more than I do -- but they're no
friends of mine.
<P>
What is "crime"? What is a moral offense? What actions are evil and
dishonorable? I find these extraordinarily difficult questions. I have
no special status that should allow me to speak with authority on such
subjects. Quite the contrary. As a writer in a scorned popular
literature and a self-professed eccentric Bohemian, I have next to no
authority of any kind. I'm not a moralist, philosopher, or prophet.
I've always considered my "moral role," such as it is, to be that of a
court jester -- a person sometimes allowed to speak the unspeakable, to
explore ideas and issues in a format where they can be treated as games,
thought-experiments, or metaphors, not as prescriptions, laws, or
sermons.
<P>
I have no religion, no sacred scripture to guide my actions and provide
an infallible moral bedrock. I'm not seeking political responsibilities
or the power of public office. I habitually question any pronouncement
of authority, and entertain the liveliest skepticism about the processes
of law and justice. I feel no urge to conform to the behavior of the
majority of my fellow citizens. I'm a pain in the neck.
<P>
My behavior is far from flawless. I lived and thrived in Austin, Texas
in the 1970s and 1980s, in a festering milieu of arty
crypto-intellectual hippies. I've committed countless "crimes," like millions
of other people in my generation. These crimes were of the glamorous
"victimless" variety, but they would surely have served to put me in
prison had I done them, say, in front of the State Legislature.
<P>
Had I lived a hundred years ago as I live today, I would probably have
been lynched by outraged fellow Texans as a moral abomination. If I
lived in Iran today and wrote and thought as I do, I would probably be
tried and executed.
<P>
As far as I can tell, moral relativism is a fact of life. I think it
might be possible to outwardly conform to every jot and tittle of the
taboos of one's society, while feeling no emotional or intellectual
commitment to them. I understand that certain philosophers have argued
that this is morally proper behavior for a good citizen. But I can't
live that life. I feel, sincerely, that my society is engaged in many
actions which are foolish and shortsighted and likely to lead to our
destruction. I feel that our society must change, and change radically,
in a process that will cause great damage to our present system of
values. This doesn't excuse my own failings, which I regret, but it does
explain, I hope, why my lifestyle and my actions are not likely to make
authority feel entirely comfortable.
<P>
Knowledge is power. The rise of computer networking, of the Information
Society, is doing strange and disruptive things to the processes by
which power and knowledge are currently distributed.  Knowledge and
information, supplied through these new conduits, are highly corrosive
to the status quo. People living in the midst of technological
revolution are living outside the law: not necessarily because they mean
to break laws, but because the laws are vague, obsolete, overbroad,
draconian, or unenforceable. Hackers break laws as a matter of course,
and some have been punished unduly for relatively minor infractions not
motivated by malice. Even computer police, seeking earnestly to
apprehend and punish wrongdoers, have been accused of abuse of their
offices, and of violation of the Constitution and the civil statutes.
These police may indeed have committed these "crimes." Some officials
have already suffered grave damage to their reputations and careers --
all the time convinced that they were morally in the right; and, like
the hackers they pursued, never feeling any genuine sense of shame,
remorse, or guilt.
<P>
I have lived, and still live, in a counterculture, with its own system
of values. Counterculture -- Bohemia -- is never far from criminality.
"To live outside the law you must be honest" was Bob Dylan's classic
hippie motto. A Bohemian finds romance in the notion that "his clothes
are dirty but his hands are clean." But there's danger in setting aside
the strictures of the law to linchpin one's honor on one's personal
integrity. If you throw away the rulebook to rely on your individual
conscience you will be put in the way of temptation.
<P>
And temptation is a burden. It hurts. It is grotesquely easy to justify,
to rationalize, an action of which one should properly be ashamed. In
investigating the milieu of computer-crime I have come into contact with
a world of temptation formerly closed to me.  Nowadays, it would take no
great effort on my part to break into computers, to steal long-distance
telephone service, to ingratiate myself with people who would merrily
supply me with huge amounts of illicitly copied software. I could even
build pipe-bombs. I haven't done these things, and disapprove of them;
in fact, having come to know these practices better than I cared to, I
feel sincere revulsion for them now. But this knowledge is a kind of
power, and power is tempting. Journalistic objectivity, or the urge to
play with ideas, cannot entirely protect you. Temptation clings to the
mind like a series of small but nagging weights. Carrying these weights
may make you stronger. Or they may drag you down.
<P>
"His clothes are dirty but his hands are clean." It's a fine ideal, when
you can live up to it. Like a lot of Bohemians, I've gazed with a fine
disdain on certain people in power whose clothes were clean but their
hands conspicuously dirty. But I've also met a few people eager to pat
me on the back, whose clothes were dirty and their hands as well.
They're not pleasant company.
<P>
Somehow one must draw a line. I'm not very good at drawing lines. When
other people have drawn me a line, I've generally been quite anxious to
have a good long contemplative look at the other side. I don't feel much
confidence in my ability to draw these lines. But I feel that I should.
The world won't wait. It only took a few guys with pool cues and
switchblades to turn Woodstock Nation into Altamont. Haight-Ashbury was
once full of people who could trust anyone they'd smoked grass with and
love anyone they'd dropped acid with -- for about six months. Soon the
place was aswarm with speed-freaks and junkies, and heaven help us if
they didn't look just like the love-bead dudes from the League of
Spiritual Discovery. Corruption exists, temptation exists. Some people
fall. And the temptation is there for all of us, all the time.
<P>
I've come to draw a line at money. It's not a good line, but it's
something. There are certain activities that are unorthodox, dubious,
illegal or quasi-legal, but they might perhaps be justified by an honest
person with unconventional standards. But in my opinion, when you're
making a commercial living from breaking the law, you're beyond the
pale. I find it hard to accept your countercultural sincerity when
you're grinning and pocketing the cash, compadre.
<P>
I can understand a kid swiping phone service when he's broke, powerless,
and dying to explore the new world of the networks. I don't approve of
this, but I can understand it. I scorn to do this myself, and I never
have; but I don't find it so heinous that it deserves pitiless
repression. But if you're stealing phone service and selling it -- if
you've made yourself a miniature phone company and you're pimping off
the energy of others just to line your own pockets -- you're a thief.
When the heat comes to put you away, don't come crying "brother" to me.
<P>
If you're creating software and giving it away, you're a fine human
being. If you're writing software and letting other people copy it and
try it out as shareware, I appreciate your sense of trust, and if I like
your work, I'll pay you. If you're copying other people's software and
giving it away, you're damaging other people's interests, and should be
ashamed, even if you're posing as a glamorous info-liberating
subversive. But if you're copying other people's software and selling
it, you're a crook and I despise you.
<P>
Writing and spreading viruses is a vile, hurtful, and shameful activity
that I unreservedly condemn.
<P>
There's something wrong with the Information Society. There's something
wrong with the idea that "information" is a commodity like a desk or a
chair. There's something wrong with patenting software algorithms.
There's something direly mean spirited and ungenerous about inventing a
language and then renting it out to other people to speak. There's
something unprecedented and sinister in this process of creeping
commodification of data and knowledge. A computer is something too close
to the human brain for me to rest entirely content with someone
patenting or copyrighting the process of its thought.  There's something
sick and unworkable about an economic system which has already spewed
forth such a vast black market. I don't think democracy will thrive in a
milieu where vast empires of data are encrypted, restricted,
proprietary, confidential, top secret, and sensitive. I fear for the
stability of a society that builds sand castles out of databits and
tries to stop a real-world tide with royal commands.
<P>
Whole societies can fall. In Eastern Europe we have seen whole nations
collapse in a slough of corruption. In pursuit of their unworkable
economic doctrine, the Marxists doubled and redoubled their efforts at
social control, while losing all sight of the values that make life
worth living. At last the entire power structure was so discredited that
the last remaining shred of moral integrity could only be found in
Bohemia: in dissidents and dramatists and their illegal samizdat
underground fanzines. Their clothes were dirty but their hands were
clean. The only agitprop poster Vaclav Havel needed was a sign saying
<EM>Vaclav Havel Guarantees Free Elections.</EM> He'd never held power, but
people believed him, and they believed his Velvet Revolution friends.
<P>
I wish there were people in the Computer Revolution who could inspire,
and deserved to inspire, that level of trust. I wish there were people
in the Electronic Frontier whose moral integrity unquestionably matched
the unleashed power of those digital machines. A society is in dire
straits when it puts its Bohemia in power. I tremble for my country when
I contemplate this prospect. And yet it's possible. If dire straits
come, it can even be the last best hope.
<P>
The issues that enmeshed me in 1990 are not going to go away. I became
involved as a writer and journalist, because I felt it was right.
Having made that decision, I intend to stand by my commitment. I expect
to stay involved in these issues, in this debate, for the rest of my
life. These are timeless issues: civil rights, knowledge, power, freedom
and privacy, the necessary steps that a civilized society must take to
protect itself from criminals. There is no finality in politics; it
creates itself anew, it must be dealt with every day.
<P>
The future is a dark road and our speed is headlong. I didn't ask for
power or responsibility. I'm a science fiction writer, I only wanted to
play with Big Ideas in my cheerfully lunatic sandbox. What little
benefit I myself can contribute to society would likely be best employed
in writing better SF novels. I intend to write those better novels, if I
can. But in the meantime I seem to have accumulated a few odd shreds of
influence. It's a very minor kind of power, and doubtless more than I
deserve; but power without responsibility is a monstrous thing.
<P>
In writing HACKER CRACKDOWN, I tried to describe the truth as other
people saw it. I see it too, with my own eyes, but I can't yet pretend
to understand what I'm seeing. The best I can do, it seems to me, is to
try to approach the situation as an open-minded person of goodwill.  I
therefore offer the following final set of principles, which I hope will
guide me in the days to come.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
I'll listen to anybody, and I'll try to imagine myself in their
situation.
<P>
<LI>
I'll assume goodwill on the part of others until they fully earn my
distrust.
<P>
<LI>
I won't cherish grudges. I'll forgive those who change their minds and
actions, just as I reserve the right to change my own mind and actions.
<P>
<LI>
I'll look hard for the disadvantages to others, in the things that give
me advantage. I won't assume that the way I live today is the natural
order of the universe, just because I happen to be benefiting from it at
the moment.
</UL>
<P>
And while I don't plan to give up making money from my ethically dubious
cyberpunk activities, I hope to temper my impropriety by giving more
work away for no money at all.

<P>
 Back in the mid-1960s, at the height of the cold war, the Department of
Defense faced a tough question: How could orders be issued to the armed
forces if the U.S. were ravaged by a nuclear assault? The communication
hubs in place at the time -- the telephone switching offices and the radio
and TV broadcast stations -- were not only vulnerable to attack, they
would also probably be the first to go. The Pentagon needed a military
command-and-control system that would continue to operate even if most of
the phone lines were in tatters and the switches had melted down.
<P>
 In 1964 a researcher at the Rand Corp. named Paul Baran came up with a
bizarre solution to this Strangelovian puzzle. He designed a
computer-communications network that had no hub, no central switching
station, no governing authority, and that assumed that the links
connecting any city to any other were totally unreliable. Baran's system
was the antithesis of the orderly, efficient phone network; it was more
like an electronic post office designed by a madman. In Baran's scheme,
each message was cut into tiny strips and stuffed into electronic
envelopes, called packets, each marked with the address of the sender and
the intended receiver. The packets were then released like so much
confetti into the web of interconnected computers, where they were tossed
back and forth over high-speed wires in the general direction of their
destination and reassembled when they finally got there. If any packets
were missing or mangled (and it was assumed that some would be), it was no
big deal; they were simply re-sent.
<P>
 Baran's packet-switching network, as it came to be called, might have
been a minor footnote in cold war history were it not for one contingency:
it took root in the computers that began showing up in universities and
government research laboratories in the late 1960s and early 1970s and
became, by a path as circuitous as one taken by those wayward packets, the
technological underpinning of the Internet.
<P>
 The Internet, for those who haven't been hanging out in cyberspace,
reading the business pages or following Doonesbury, is the mother of all
computer networks -- an anarchistic electronic freeway that has spread
uncontrollably and now circles the globe. It is at once the shining
archetype and the nightmare vision of the information highway that the
Clinton Administration has been touting and that the telephone and
cable-TV companies are racing to build. Much of what Bell Atlantic and
Time Warner are planning to sell -- interactivity, two-way communications,
multimedia info on demand -- the Internet already provides for free. And
because of its cold war roots, the Internet has one quality that makes it
a formidable competitor: you couldn't destroy it if you tried.
<P>
 Nobody owns the Internet, and no single organization controls its use. In
the mid-1980s the National Science Foundation built the high-speed,
long-distance data lines that form Internet's U.S. backbone. But the major
costs of running the network are shared in a cooperative arrangement by
its primary users: universities, national labs, high-tech corporations and
foreign governments. Two years ago, the NSF lifted restrictions against
commercial use of the Internet, and in September the White House announced
a plan to make it the starting point for an even grander concept called
the National Information Infrastructure.
<P>
 Suddenly the Internet is the place to be. College students are queuing up
outside computing centers to get online. Executives are ordering new
business cards that show off their Internet addresses. Millions of people
around the world are logging on to tap into libraries, call up satellite
weather photos, download free computer programs and participate in
discussion groups with everyone from lawyers to physicists to
sadomasochists. Even the President and Vice President have their own
Internet accounts (although they aren't very good at answering their
mail). "It's the Internet boom," says network activist Mitch Kapor, who
thinks the true sign that popular interest has reached critical mass came
this summer when the New Yorker printed a cartoon showing two
computer-savvy canines with the caption, "On the Internet, nobody knows
you're a dog."
<P>
 But the Internet is not ready for prime time. There are no TV Guides to
sort through the 5,000 discussion groups or the 2,500 electronic
newsletters or the tens of thousands of computers with files to share.
Instead of feeling surrounded by information, first-timers ("newbies" in
the jargon of the Net) are likely to find themselves adrift in a
borderless sea. Old-timers say the first wave of dizziness doesn't last
long. "It's like driving a car with a clutch," says Thomas Lunzer, a
network designer at SRI International, a California consulting firm.
"Once you figure it out, you can drive all over the place."
<P>
 But you must learn new languages (like UNIX), new forms of address (like
<TT>&lt;president@white house.gov&gt;</TT>) and new ways of expressing feeling (like those
ubiquitous sideways smiley faces), and you must master a whole set of
rules for how to behave, called netiquette. Rule No. 1: Don't ask dumb
questions. In fact, don't ask any questions at all before you've read the
FAQ (frequently asked questions) files. Otherwise you risk annoying a few
hundred thousand people who may either yell at you (IN ALL CAPS!) or,
worse still, ignore you.
<P>
 All that is starting to change, however, as successive waves of netters
demand, and eventually get, more user-friendly tools for navigating the
Internet. In fact, anyone with a desktop computer and a modem connecting
it to a phone line can now find ways into and around the network. "The
Internet isn't just computer scientists talking to one another anymore,"
says Glee Willis, the engineering librarian at the University of Nevada at
Reno and one of nearly 20,000 (mostly female) academic librarians who have
joined the Internet in the past five years. "It's a family place. It's a
place for perverts. It's everything rolled into one."
<P>
 As traffic swells, the Internet is beginning to suffer the problems of
any heavily traveled highway, including vandalism, break-ins and traffic
jams. "It's like an amusement park that's so successful that there are
long waits for the most popular rides," says David Farber, a professor of
information science at the University of Pennsylvania and one of the
network's original architects. And while most users wait patiently for the
access and information they need, rogue hackers use stolen passwords to
roam the network, exploring forbidden computers and reading other people's
mail.
<P>
 How big is the Internet? Part of its mystique is that nobody knows for
sure. The only fact that can be measured precisely is the number of
computers directly connected to it by high-speed links -- a figure that is
updated periodically by sending a computer program crawling around like a
Roto-Rooter, tallying the number of connections (last count: roughly 2
million). But that figure does not include military computers that for
security reasons are invisible to other users, or the hundreds of people
who may share a single Internet host. Nor does it include millions more
who dial into the Internet through the growing number of commercial
gateways, such as Panix and Netcom, which offer indirect telephone access
for $10 to $20 a month. When all these users are taken into account, the
total number of people around the world who can get into the Internet one
way or another may be 20 million. "It's a large country," says Farber of
the Internet population. "We ought to apply to the U.N. as the first
nation in cyberspace."
<P>
 That nation is about to get even bigger as the major commercial computer
networks -- Prodigy, CompuServe, America Online, GEnie and Delphi Internet
Service -- begin to dismantle the walls that have separated their private
operations from the public Internet. The success of the Internet is a
matter of frustration to the owners of the commercial networks, who have
tried all sorts of marketing tricks and still count fewer than 5 million
subscribers among them. Most commercial networks now allow electronic mail
to pass between their services and the Internet. Delphi, which was
purchased by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. in September, began providing its
customers full Internet access last summer. America Online (which
publishes an electronic version of Time) is scheduled to begin offering
limited Internet services later this month.
<P>
 People who use these new entry points into the Net may be in for a shock.
Unlike the family-oriented commercial services, which censor messages they
find offensive, the Internet imposes no restrictions. Anybody can start a
discussion on any topic and say anything. There have been sporadic
attempts by local network managers to crack down on the raunchier
discussion groups, but as Internet pioneer <VAR>John Gilmore</VAR>
<A NAME="IDX555"></A>
puts it, "The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it."
<P>
 The casual visitor to the newsgroups on the Usenet (a bulletin-board
system that began as a competitor to the Internet but has been largely
subsumed by it) will discover discussion groups labeled, according to the
Net's idiosyncratic cataloging system, alt.sex.masturbation,
alt.sex.bondage and alt.sex.fetish.feet. On Internet Relay Chat, a global
24-hour-a-day message board, one can stumble upon imaginary orgies played
out with one-line typed commands
("Now I'm taking off your shirt..."). In
<TT>alt.binaries.pictures.erotica</TT>, a user can peek at snapshots that
would make a sailor blush.
<P>
 But those who focus on the Internet's sexual content risk missing the
point. For every sexually oriented discussion group there are hundreds on
tamer and often more substantial topics ranging from bungee jumping to
particle physics. Last week Virginia college student <VAR>Chris Glover</VAR>
responded to a distressed message from a suicidal undergraduate in Denver.
After two hours of messages back and forth, Glover was able to pinpoint
<A NAME="IDX556"></A>
the woman's location and call for help.
<P>
 With all this variety, Internet users are unimpressed by television's
promise of a 500-channel future. The Internet already delivers 10,000
channels, and the only obstacle that prevents it from carrying live TV
pictures is the bandwidth (or carrying capacity) of the data lines. Some
video clips -- and at least one full-length video movie -- are already
available on the network. And last spring, writer Carl Malamud began using
the Internet to distribute a weekly "radio" interview show called Geek
of the Week. Malamud is undeterred by the fact that it takes a computer
about an hour over a high-speed modem to capture the 30 minutes of sound
that a $10 radio can pick up instantly for free. But bandwidth capacity
has nowhere to go but up, says Malamud, and its cost will only go down.
<P>
 The Internet, however, will have to go through some radical changes
before it can join the world of commerce. Subsidized for so long by the
Federal Government, its culture is not geared to normal business
activities. It does not take kindly to unsolicited advertisements; use
electronic mail to promote your product and you are likely to be inundated
with hate mail directed not only at you personally but also at your
supervisor, your suppliers and your customers as well. "It's a perfect
Marxist state, where almost nobody does any business," says Farber. "But
at some point that will have to change."
<P>
 The change has already begun. NSF's contribution now represents about 10%
of the total cost of the network, and the agency is scheduled to start
phasing out its support next April, removing at the same time what few
restrictions still remain against commercial activity. According to Tim
O'Reilly, president of O'Reilly &#38; Associates, a publisher experimenting
with advertiser-supported Internet magazines, the system could evolve in
one of two ways: either entrepreneurs will manage to set up shop on a
free-market version of the Internet, or some consortium will take the
whole thing over and turn it into a giant CompuServe. "That's an
outcome," O'Reilly says, "that would effectively destroy the Internet as
we know it."
<P>
 As the traffic builds and the billboards go up, some Internet veterans
are mourning the old electronic freeway. "I feel kind of sad about it,"
says Denise Caruso, editorial director of Friday Holdings, a publisher
specializing in new media. "It was such a dynamic, pulsing thing. I
wonder whether we shouldn't have left it alone." Others see the period of
uncertainty ahead as a rare opportunity for citizens to shape their own
technological destiny. "We need... a firm idea of the kind of media
environment we would like to see in the future," warns Howard Rheingold
in his new book, The Virtual Community. While it may be difficult for
communities as diverse as those on the Internet to set their own agenda,
it seems increasingly likely that if they don't, someone else will do it
for them.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
"I just returned from a network meeting in San Diego today and thought you
would be interested in my interpretation of what NSF proposes for the National
Education and Research Network (NREN). Rather than comment specifically, I
decided it would be interesting to write a <EM>parody</EM> which relates the NREN to
the construction of a national super highway. Doing so removes the highly
technical aspects of the overall planned functions the NREN.
Please excuse this style, but I think its the only way to explain my
understanding of their plan in a way that does not immediately get very
technical. It may be flawed, but the information is based upon
Hans-Werner Braun's presentation.... as I understood it."

<A NAME="IDX560"></A>
<A NAME="IDX561"></A>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The National Science Foundation is in the process of developing plans to
build a national super highway that will advance transportation technology in
our country. The super highway proposed will replace the existing interstate
highway system and allow speeds of at least 240 MPH. the following interview
with NSF developers explores their current plans.
<P>
*
<P>
ME: I understand you are building a new Super national
highway<A NAME="FOOT8" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT8">(8)</A> to serve the
<A NAME="IDX562"></A>
purposes of advancing ground transportation throughout our county.
<P>
NSF: Yes we are, as a part of an earlier initiative sponsored by the then
Senator Gore. We are very excited about the technology that will allow
transportation speeds of
240 MPH<A NAME="FOOT9" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT9">(9)</A> across the country.
  
ME: That sounds exciting, how will it be built?
<P>
NSF: Well, we will have this super highway designed to allow the high speed
travel<A NAME="FOOT10" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT10">(10)</A>
and it will have six entrance/exit
<A NAME="IDX563"></A>
ramps.<A NAME="FOOT11" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT11">(11)</A>
 
ME: Ahh.... that doesn't sound like very many ramps, where will they be
located?
<P>
NSF: Well, several years ago we funded the establishment of six gourmet
restaurants<A NAME="FOOT12" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT12">(12)</A>
scattered across the country, we are going to fund the building
of the super highway and access ramps at the restaurant locations. We are
however allowing the ramp
contractor<A NAME="FOOT13" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT13">(13)</A>
to build as many ramps as he wishes, at his own expense.
<P>
ME: I assume then the contractor for the
highway<A NAME="FOOT14" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT14">(14)</A>
builds ramps where ever it makes sense to optimize access.
<P>
NSF: Well, not exactly. We are separating the contracts for the ramps and the
highway so the bidders can be very competitive.
<P>
ME: I see. How to you plan to connect the rest of the interstate highway
system<A NAME="FOOT15" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT15">(15)</A>
to your super national highway?
<P>
NSF: Well actually, its not part of our plan. We are having the highway and
access ramps built for us, its up to the states or other government agencies
to provide the highways to the access ramps. We will however fund a few temporary
roads<A NAME="FOOT16" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT16">(16)</A>
to connect parts of the existing interstate highway system, but don't
intend to make them permanent. Did I forget to mention that we will be
shutting down the existing interstate highway
system?<A NAME="FOOT17" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT17">(17)</A>
<P>
ME: You mean I will no longer be able to drive across the existing interstate
highway system?
<P>
NSF: Yes, it will be destroyed.
<P>
ME: OK, lets see If I understand. I have a state highway system for example,
and I put in a connecting highway to your super highway, and I can now travel
on it, right?
<P>
NSF: Well, no you can't. The super highway will only be used for vehicles that
can run
240 MPH<A NAME="FOOT18" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT18">(18)</A>
and we must approve every vehicle, destination, and trip
the vehicle
takes.<A NAME="FOOT19" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT19">(19)</A>
We don't want our super highway clogged with vehicles which can only travel
70 MPH!<A NAME="FOOT20" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT20">(20)</A>
<P>
ME: I'm confused. You mean you want my state for example, to build an access
road to a super highway it can't generally use?
<P>
NSF: Well, yes and no. You see we also want to encourage development of toll
roads in our
country.<A NAME="FOOT21" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT21">(21)</A>
Our six high speed access ramps are wide enough to
allow parallel toll roads to be accessed as well as our super highway. Private
road builders will be able to put in toll roads between our access ramps, for
a fee.
<P>
ME: So there will no longer be a "free" interstate highway system?
<P>
NSF: Right!
<P>
ME: Lets see if I got this straight. You build a national super highway that
has six access ramps located where you once established gourmet restaurants
and you destroy the interstate highway system. There are no plans to replicate the
functionality of the interstate highway systems, but you will allow private
toll road builders to use your wide access ramps and develop parallel toll
roads to your super highway. My state or the government has to build the roads
that lead to the super highway, but once there, cannot travel on it unless the
specific vehicle can run at 240 MPH and has specific permission from you to
travel on it.
<P>
NSF: You've got it!
<P>
ME: Well then you must have a very interesting reason to put this highway and
the access ramps at these restaurant locations.
<P>
NSF: Well, you see, the gourmet food business isn't what it used to be. Fast
food has really taken over in our country, we really need to preserve the
gourmet food
business.<A NAME="FOOT22" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT22">(22)</A>
High quality restaurants should be located right
off of classy high speed highways. We really would like to encourage restaurant
patrons to use the super highway so they can have breakfast in San Diego and
dinner in Champaign Illinois. We will be looking for patrons who can afford to
eat at multiple restaurants and we will let them ride the highway for free! Of
course they must have a vehicle that can go
240 MPH.<A NAME="FOOT23" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT23">(23)</A>
<P>
ME: I'm even more confused. How will I get across the country?
<P>
NSF: Well, if your state puts in an access road to one of our access ramps you
take it, and then exit-off on to one of the toll roads that will be built
parallel to our super highway.
<P>
ME: How fast will I be able to
go?<A NAME="FOOT24" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT24">(24)</A>
<P>
NSF: What ever the speed limit is on the toll road.
<P>
ME: What will it cost me to ride on it?
<P>
NSF: What ever the toll is. You see, we expect that several toll roads will be
developed. Competition! It should keep the price down.
<P>
ME: When the super highway is empty, how will it be used?
<P>
NSF: Well, we are telling the gourmet restaurants that they should work
together even though they will be competing with each other for
customers.<A NAME="FOOT25" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT25">(25)</A>
You know, they could develop plans to send trash to each other so they can
demonstrate how fast the transportation is on the super highway, it would be
in their best interest.<A NAME="FOOT26" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT26">(26)</A>
<P>
ME: Aren't there plans for development of high speed toll roads already in
progress by several toll road builders? What makes you think they will put
their roads in-between your access
ramps?<A NAME="FOOT27" HREF="bdg_foot.html#FOOT27">(27)</A>
<P>
NSF: F.O.D.
<P>
ME: What?
<P>
NSF: Field Of Dreams. If we build it they will come.
<P>
ME: So again, tell me who pays for what?
<P>
NSF: The government funds the super highway and six access ramps. The toll
road providers build their own roads and pays an access fee for the ramps. The
states and other government agencies pay for any roads necessary to get to the
access ramps. When you get on a toll road and pay what ever the price is.
<P>
ME: And the only one's allowed to ride on the super highway are those persons
who have special vehicles that can go 240 MPH with your specific permission,
or those who can afford to frequent the gourmet restaurants and travel at 240
MPH. Everyone else takes the toll roads.
<P>
NSF: Right, but don't forget the trash runs between restaurants!
<P>
ME: Oh, how silly of me! Hmmmm. I wonder if this is really what Senator Gore
had in mind?

<H1><A NAME="SEC268" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC268">The Lingo</A></H1>
<IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC=logos/bdgtti.gif>
<P>
This glossary is only a tiny subset of net.speak, all the various terms and
phrases that people regularly use on Internet.  For a more
complete (and more entertaining) reference, get a
copy of <I>The New Hacker's Dictionary</I>, which is based on a VERY
large text file called the Jargon File, edited by Eric Raymond
<A NAME="IDX565"></A>
<TT>&lt;eric@snark.thyrsus.com&gt;</TT>.
<P>
The 2nd edition just came out in December 1993, and is available from
the MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 02142.
The up-to-date version of the Jargon File
<I>The on-line hacker Jargon File, version 3.0, 29 July 1993</I>,
is kept on various FTP servers
<A NAME="IDX566"></A>
(e.g. from <B>ftp.gnu.ai.mit.edu</B> as file <TT>`/pub/gnu/jarg300.txt.gz'</TT>).
<P>
<B><CODE>:-)</CODE></B>
This odd symbol is one of the ways a person can portray "mood" in
the very flat medium of computers--by using "smilies."  This is
"metacommunication," and there are literally hundreds of them, from
the obvious to the obscure (see section <A HREF="bdg_290.html#SEC293">The Unofficial Smiley Dictionary</A>).
This particular example expresses "happiness."  Don't see it?
Tilt your head to the left 90 degrees. Smilies, or smileys are also
used to denote sarcasm.
<P>
<B>ASCII</B>
Has two meanings.  ASCII is a universal computer code
for English letters and characters.  Computers store
all information as binary numbers. In ASCII, the
letter "A" is stored as 01000001, whether the computer
is made by IBM, Apple or Commodore.  ASCII also refers
to a method, or protocol, for copying files from one
computer to another over a network, in which neither
computer checks for any errors that might have been
caused by static or other problems.
<P>
<B>ANSI</B>
Computers use several different methods for deciding
how to put information on your screen and how your
keyboard interacts with the screen.  ANSI is one of
these "terminal emulation" methods.  Although most
popular on PC-based bulletin-board systems, it can also
be found on some Net sites.  To use it properly, you
will first have to turn it on, or enable it, in your
communications software.
<P>
<B>ARPANet</B>
A predecessor of the Internet.  Started in 1969 with
funds from the Defense Department's Advanced Projects
Research Agency.
<P>
<B>Backbone</B>
A high-speed network that connects several powerful
computers.  In the U.S., the backbone of the Internet is
often considered the NSFNet, a government funded link
between a handful of supercomputer sites across the
country.
<P>
<B>Baud</B>
The speed at which modems transfer data.  One baud is
roughly equal to one bit per second.  It takes eight
bits to make up one letter or character.  Modems rarely
transfer data at exactly the same speed as their listed
baud rate because of static or computer problems. More
expensive modems use systems, such as Microcom Network
Protocol (MNP), which can correct for these errors or
which "compress" data to speed up transmission.
<P>
<B>BITNet</B>
Another, academically oriented, international computer
network, which uses a different set of computer
instructions to move data.  It is easily accessible to
Internet users through e-mail, and provides a large
number of conferences and databases.  Its name comes from
"Because It's Time."
<P>
<B>Bounce</B>
What your e-mail does when it cannot get to its
recipient -- it bounces back to you -- unless it goes 
off into the ether, never to be found again.
<P>
<B>Command line</B>
On Unix host systems, this is where you tell the
machine what you want it to do, by entering commands.
<P>
<B>Communications software</B>
A program that tells a modem how to work.
<P>
<B>Daemon</B>
An otherwise harmless Unix program that normally works
out of sight of the user. On the Internet, you'll most
likely encounter it only when your e-mail is not
delivered to your recipient -- you'll get back your
original message plus an ugly message from a "mailer
daemon."
<P>
<B>Distribution</B>
A way to limit where your Usenet postings go.  Handy for
such things as "for sale" messages or discussions of
regional politics.
<P>
<B>Domain</B>
The last part of an Internet address, such as "news.com."
<P>
<B>Dot</B>
When you want to impress the net veterans you meet at
parties, say "dot" instead of "period," for example: "My
address is john at site dot domain dot com."
<P>
<B>Dot file</B>
A file on a Unix public-access system
that alters the way you or your messages interact with
that system.  For example, your .login file contains
various parameters for such things as the text editor you
get when you send a message.   When you do an ls command,
these files do not appear in the directory listing; do
<SAMP>`ls -a'</SAMP> to list them.
<P>
<B>Down</B>
When a public-access site runs into technical trouble,
and you can no longer gain access to it, it's down.
<P>
<B>Download</B>
Copy a file from a host system to your computer.  There
are several different methods, or protocols, for
downloading files, most of which periodically check the
file as it is being copied to ensure no information is
inadvertently destroyed or damaged during the process.
Some, such as XMODEM, only let you download one file at
a time.  Others, such as batch-YMODEM and ZMODEM, let
you type in the names of several files at once, which
are then automatically downloaded.
<P>

The White Sands Missile Range used to maintain a giant 
collection of free and low-cost software of all kinds, 
which was "mirrored" to numerous other ftp sites on the
Net.  In the fall of 1993, the Air Force decided it had
better things to do than maintain a free software library
and shut it down.  But you'll still see references to
the collection, known as SIMTEL20, around the Net.
<P>

The last changes were made on 30 Nov 91 by Brad Templeton.
<P>
<B>NOTE:</B> this is intended to be satirical.  If you do not recognize
it as such, consult a doctor or professional comedian.  The
recommendations in this article should recognized for what
they are -- admonitions about what NOT to do.
<P>
"Dear Emily Postnews"
<P>
<EM>Ms Emily Postnews</EM>, foremost authority on proper net behaviour,
<A NAME="IDX569"></A>
gives her advice on how to act on the net.
<P>
*
<P>
<I>Dear Miss Postnews: How long should my signature be?</I>
-- <TT>&lt;verbose@noisy&gt;</TT>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Dear Verbose: Please try and make your signature as long as you
can.  It's much more important than your article, of course, so try
to have more lines of signature than actual text.
<P>
Try to include a large graphic made of ASCII characters, plus lots of
cute quotes and slogans.  People will never tire of reading these
pearls of wisdom again and again, and you will soon become personally
associated with the joy each reader feels at seeing yet another
delightful repeat of your signature.
<P>
Be sure as well to include a complete map of USENET with each
signature, to show how anybody can get mail to you from any site in
the world.  Be sure to include Internet gateways as well.  Also tell
people on your own site how to mail to you.  Give independent
addresses for Internet, UUCP, and BITNET, even if they're all the
same.
<P>
Aside from your reply address, include your full name, company and
organization.  It's just common courtesy -- after all, in some
newsreaders people have to type an <EM>entire</EM> keystroke to go back to
the top of your article to see this information in the header.
<P>
By all means include your phone number and street address in every
single article.  People are always responding to usenet articles with
phone calls and letters.  It would be silly to go to the extra trouble
of including this information only in articles that need a response by
conventional channels!
<P>
*
<P>
<I>Dear Emily: Today I posted an article and forgot to include my
signature.  What should I do?</I>
-- <TT>&lt;forgetful@myvax&gt;</TT>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Dear Forgetful: Rush to your terminal right away and post an
article that says, "Oops, I forgot to post my signature with that last
article.  Here it is."
<P>
Since most people will have forgotten your earlier article,
(particularly since it dared to be so boring as to not have a nice,
juicy signature) this will remind them of it.  Besides, people care
much more about the signature anyway.  See the previous letter for
more important details.
<P>
Also, be sure to include your signature TWICE in each article.  That
way you're sure people will read it.
<P>
*
<P>
<I>Dear Ms. Postnews: I couldn't get mail through to somebody on
another site.  What should I do?</I>
-- <TT>&lt;eager@beaver.dam&gt;</TT>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Dear Eager: No problem, just post your message to a group that a
lot of people read.  Say, "This is for John Smith.  I couldn't get
mail through so I'm posting it.  All others please ignore."
<P>
This way tens of thousands of people will spend a few seconds scanning
over and ignoring your article, using up over 16 man-hours their
collective time, but you will be saved the terrible trouble of
checking through Usenet maps or looking for alternate routes.  Just
think, if you couldn't distribute your message to 30,000 other
computers, you might actually have to (gasp) call directory assistance
for 60 cents, or even phone the person.  This can cost as much as a
few DOLLARS (!) for a 5 minute call!
<P>
And certainly it's better to spend 10 to 20 dollars of other people's
money distributing the message then for you to have to waste $9 on an
overnight letter, or even 29 cents on a stamp!
<P>
Don't forget.  The world will end if your message doesn't get through,
so post it as many places as you can.
<P>
*
<P>
<I>Q: What about a test message?</I>
<P>
<B>A:</B> It is important, when testing, to test the entire net.  Never test
merely a subnet distribution when the whole net can be done.  Also put
"please ignore" on your test messages, since we all know that
everybody always skips a message with a line like that.  Don't use a
subject like "My sex is female but I demand to be addressed as male."
because such articles are read in depth by all USEnauts.
<P>
*
<P>
<I>Q: Somebody just posted that Roman Polanski directed Star Wars.  What
should I do?</I>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Post the correct answer at once!  We can't have people go on
believing that!  Very good of you to spot this.  You'll probably be
the only one to make the correction, so post as soon as you can.  No
time to lose, so certainly don't wait a day, or check to see if
somebody else has made the correction.
<P>
And it's not good enough to send the message by mail.  Since you're
the only one who really knows that it was Francis Coppola, you have to
inform the whole net right away!
<P>
*
<P>
<I>Q: I read an article that said, "reply by mail, I'll summarize."  What
should I do?</I>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Post your response to the whole net.  That request applies only to
dumb people who don't have something interesting to say.  Your
postings are much more worthwhile than other people's, so it would be
a waste to reply by mail.
<P>
*
<P>
<I>Q: I collected replies to an article I wrote, and now it's time to
summarize.  What should I do?</I>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Simply concatenate all the articles together into a big file and
post that.  On USENET, this is known as a summary.  It lets people
read all the replies without annoying newsreaders getting in the way.
Do the same when summarizing a vote.
<P>
*
<P>
<I>Q: I saw a long article that I wish to rebut carefully, what should I do?</I>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Include the entire text with your article, particularly the
signature, and include your comments closely packed between the lines.
Be sure to post, and not mail, even though your article looks like a
reply to the original.  Everybody <EM>loves</EM> to read those long
point-by-point debates, especially when they evolve into name-calling
and lots of "Is too!" -- "Is not!" -- "Is too, twizot!" exchanges.
<P>
Be sure to follow-up everything, and never let another person get in
the last word on a net debate.  Why, if people let other people have
the last word, then discussions would actually stop!  Remember, other
net readers aren't nearly as clever as you, and if somebody posts
something wrong, the readers can't possibly realize that on their own
without your elucidations.  If somebody gets insulting in their net
postings, the best response is to get right down to their level and
fire a return salvo.  When I read one net person make an insulting
attack on another, I always immediately take it as gospel unless a
rebuttal is posted.  It never makes me think less of the insulter, so
it's your duty to respond.
<P>
*
<P>
<I>Q: How can I choose what groups to post in?</I>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Pick as many as you can, so that you get the widest audience.
After all, the net exists to give you an audience.  Ignore those who
suggest you should only use groups where you think the article is
highly appropriate.  Pick all groups where anybody might even be
slightly interested.
<P>
Always make sure followups go to all the groups.  In the rare event
that you post a followup which contains something original, make sure
you expand the list of groups.  Never include a "Followup-to:" line in
the header, since some people might miss part of the valuable
discussion in the fringe groups.
<P>
*
<P>
<I>Q: How about an example?</I>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Ok.  Let's say you want to report that Gretzky has been traded from
the Oilers to the Kings.  Now right away you might think
<TT>rec.sport.hockey</TT>
would be enough.  WRONG.  Many more people might be
interested.  This is a big trade!  Since it's a NEWS article, it
belongs in the
<TT>news.*</TT>
hierarchy as well.  If you are a news admin, or
there is one on your machine, try
<TT>news.admin</TT>.
If not, use
<TT>news.misc</TT>.
<P>
The Oilers are probably interested in geology, so try
<TT>sci.geo.fluids</TT>.
He is a big star, so post to
<TT>sci.astro</TT>, and
<TT>sci.space</TT>
because they are
also interested in stars.  And of course
<TT>comp.dcom.telecom</TT>
because he
was born in the birthplace of the telephone.  And because he's
Canadian, post to
<TT>soc.culture.Ontario.southwestern</TT>.
But that group
doesn't exist, so cross-post to
<TT>news.groups</TT>
suggesting it should be
created.  With this many groups of interest, your article will be
quite bizarre, so post to
<TT>talk.bizarre</TT>
as well.  (And post to
<TT>comp.std.mumps</TT>,
since they hardly get any articles there, and a "comp"
group will propagate your article further.)
<P>
You may also find it is more fun to post the article once in each
group.  If you list all the newsgroups in the same article, some
newsreaders will only show the the article to the reader once!  Don't
tolerate this.
<P>
*
<P>
<I>Q: How do I create a newsgroup?</I>
<P>
<B>A:</B> The easiest way goes something like <SAMP>`inews -C newgroup ...'</SAMP>, and
while that will stir up lots of conversation about your new newsgroup,
it might not be enough.
<P>
First post a message in news.groups describing the group.  This is a
"call for discussion."  (If you see a call for discussion, immediately
post a one line message saying that you like or dislike the group.)
When proposing the group, pick a name with a TLA (three-letter
acronym) that will be understood only by "in" readers of the group.
<P>
After the call for discussion, post the call for flames, followed by a
call for arguments about the name and a call for run-on puns.
Eventually make a call for "votes." USENET is a democracy, so voters
can now all post their votes to ensure they get to all 30,000 machines
instead of just the person counting. Every few days post a long
summary of all the votes so that people can complain about bad mailers
and double votes.  It means you'll be more popular and get lots of
mail.  At the end of 21 days you can post the vote results so that
people can argue about all the technical violations of the guidelines
you made.  Blame them on the moderator-of-the-week for
news.announce.newgroups.  Then your group might be created.
<P>
To liven up discussion, choose a good cross-match for your hierarchy
and group.  For example, comp.race.formula1 or soc.vlsi.design would
be good group names.  If you want your group created quickly, include
an interesting word like "sex" or "activism."  To avoid limiting
discussion, make the name as broad as possible, and don't forget that
TLA.
<P>
If possible, count votes from a leaf site with a once-a-week polled
connection to botswanavax.  Schedule the vote during your relay site's
head crash if possible.
<P>
Under no circumstances use the trial group method, because it
eliminates the discussion, flame, pun, voting and guideline-violation
accusation phases, thus taking all the fun out of it.  To create an
ALT group, simply issue the creation command.  Then issue an rmgroup
and some more newgroup messages to save other netters the trouble of
doing that part.
<P>

<P>
<I>Q: I cant spell worth a dam.  I hope your going too tell me what to do?</I>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Don't worry about how your articles look.  Remember it's the
message that counts, not the way it's presented.  Ignore the fact that
sloppy spelling in a purely written forum sends out the same silent
messages that soiled clothing would when addressing an audience.
<P>
<I>Q: How should I pick a subject for my articles?</I>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Keep it short and meaningless.  That way people will be forced to
actually read your article to find out what's in it.  This means a
bigger audience for you, and we all know that's what the net is for.
If you do a followup, be sure and keep the same subject, even if it's
totally meaningless and not part of the same discussion.  If you
don't, you won't catch all the people who are looking for stuff on the
original topic, and that means less audience for you.
<P>
*
<P>
<I>Q: What sort of tone should I take in my article?</I>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Be as outrageous as possible.  If you don't say outlandish things,
and fill your article with libelous insults of net people, you may not
stick out enough in the flood of articles to get a response.  The more
insane your posting looks, the more likely it is that you'll get lots
of followups.  The net is here, after all, so that you can get lots of
attention.
<P>
If your article is polite, reasoned and to the point, you may only get
mailed replies.  Yuck!
<P>
*
<P>
<I>Q: The posting software suggested I had too long a signature and too
many lines of included text in my article.  What's the best course?</I>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Such restrictions were put in the software for no reason at all, so
don't even try to figure out why they might apply to your article.
Turns out most people search the net to find nice articles that
consist of the complete text of an earlier article plus a few lines.
<P>
In order to help these people, fill your article with dummy original
lines to get past the restrictions.  Everybody will thank you for it.
<P>
For your signature, I know it's tough, but you will have to read it in
with the editor.  Do this twice to make sure it's firmly in there.  By
the way, to show your support for the free distribution of
information, be sure to include a copyright message forbidding
transmission of your article to sites whose USENET politics you don't
like.
<P>
Also, if you do have a lot of free time and want to trim down the text
in your article, be sure to delete some of the attribution lines so
that it looks like the original author of -- say -- a plea for world
peace actually wrote the followup calling for the nuking of Bermuda.
<P>
*
<P>
<I>Q: They just announced on the radio that the United States has invaded
Iraq.  Should I post?</I>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Of course.  The net can reach people in as few as 3 to 5 days.
It's the perfect way to inform people about such news events long
after the broadcast networks have covered them.  As you are probably
the only person to have heard the news on the radio, be sure to post
as soon as you can.
<P>
*
<P>
<I>Q: I have this great joke.  You see, these three strings walk into a bar...</I>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Oh dear.  Don't spoil it for me.  Submit it to rec.humor, and post
it to the moderator of
<TT>rec.humor.funny</TT>
at the same time.  I'm sure he's never seen that joke.
<P>
*
<P>
<I>Q: What computer should I buy?  An Atari ST or an Amiga?</I>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Cross post that question to the Atari and Amiga groups.  It's an
interesting and novel question that I am sure they would love to
investigate in those groups.  There is no need to read the groups in
advance or examine the "frequently asked question" lists to see if the
topic has already been dealt with.  In fact, you don't need to read
the group at all, and you can tell people that in your query.
<P>
*
<P>
<I>Q: What about other important questions?  How should I know when to
post?</I>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Always post them.  It would be a big waste of your time to find a
knowledgeable user in one of the groups and ask through private mail
if the topic has already come up.  Much easier to bother thousands of
people with the same question.
<P>
*
<P>
<I>Q: Somebody just posted a query to the net, and I want to get the
answer too.  What should I do?</I>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Immediately post a following, including the complete text of the
query.  At the bottom add, "Me too!"  If somebody else has done this,
follow up their article and add "Me three," or whatever number is
appropriate.  Don't forget your full signature.  After all, if you
just mail the original poster and ask for a copy of the answers, you
will simply clutter the poster's mailbox, and save people who do
answer the question the joyful duty of noting all the "me (n)s" and
sending off all the multiple copies.
<P>
*
<P>
<I>Q: What is the measure of a worthwhile group?</I>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Why, it's Volume, Volume, Volume.  Any group that has lots of noise
in it must be good.  Remember, the higher the volume of material in a
group, the higher percentage of useful, factual and insightful
articles you will find.  In fact, if a group can't demonstrate a high
enough volume, it should be deleted from the net.
<P>
*
<P>
<I>Q: Emily, I'm having a serious disagreement with somebody on the net.
I tried complaints to his sysadmin, organizing mail campaigns, called
for his removal from the net and phoning his employer to get him
fired.  Everybody laughed at me.  What can I do?</I>
<P>
<B>A:</B> Go to the daily papers.  Most modern reporters are top-notch
computer experts who will understand the net, and your problems,
perfectly.  They will print careful, reasoned stories without any
errors at all, and surely represent the situation properly to the
public.  The public will also all act wisely, as they are also fully
cognizant of the subtle nature of net society.
<P>
Papers never sensationalize or distort, so be sure to point out things
like racism and sexism wherever they might exist.  Be sure as well
that they understand that all things on the net, particularly insults,
are meant literally.  Link what transpires on the net to the causes of
the Holocaust, if possible.  If regular papers won't take the story,
go to a tabloid paper -- they are always interested in good stories.
<P>
By arranging all this free publicity for the net, you'll become very
well known.  People on the net will wait in eager anticipation for
your every posting, and refer to you constantly.  You'll get more mail
than you ever dreamed possible -- the ultimate in net success.
<P>

<I>Q: What does foobar stand for?</I>
<P>
<B>A: It stands for you, dear.</B>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<EM>"News articles are separated into divisions called 
newsgroups. Each division is supposed to limit itself 
to a single topic, and the name of the group is 
supposed to give you some idea as to the content of the
group. These groups are then organized into hierarchies
of related topics. Usenet Network News started out with 
just two hierarchies, mod and net. The mod hierarchy 
had those groups that had a person as the moderator to
edit and control the information. The net hierarchy 
handled all other groups. With the release of B News 
and its ability to have any single group be moderated
or open, the great renaming was undertaken."</EM>

<EM>The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)</EM> was founded in July of 1990 to
ensure that the principles embodied in the Constitution and the Bill of
<A NAME="IDX570"></A>
<A NAME="IDX571"></A>
<A NAME="IDX572"></A>
Rights are protected as new communications technologies emerge.
<P>
From the beginning, EFF has worked to shape our nation's communications
infrastructure and the policies that govern it in order to maintain and
enhance First Amendment, privacy and other democratic values. We believe
that our overriding public goal must be the creation of Electronic
Democracy, so our work focuses on the establishment of:
<P>
<UL>

new laws that protect citizens' basic Constitutional rights as they
use new communications technologies,

a policy of common carriage requirements for all network providers
so that all speech, no matter how controversial, will be carried without
discrimination,
<P>
<LI>
a National Public Network where voice, data and video services are

a diversity of communities that enable all citizens to have a voice

<P>
EFF's Open Platform Proposal advocates that the nation's telecommunications
infrastructure providers offer affordable, widely available transmission of
voice, data and video information.  The telecommunications infrastructure
must promote broad access and enable citizens to receive and publish a
diversity of information.  In addition, a competitive environment must be
ensured to preserve the core principles of common carriage, universal
service and open standards.
<P>
In the near term, EFF supports the implementation of services such as ISDN
and ADSL, currently available digital technologies, for sending voice, data
<A NAME="IDX573"></A>
<A NAME="IDX574"></A>
and video at reasonable cost to consumers.
<P>
EFF supports federal funding to promote the development of network tools
and applications that will make the Internet and the NREN easier to use.
Although the NREN will be made up of services from commercial providers,
government also has a vital role to play in making grants to institutions
<A NAME="IDX575"></A>
that cannot afford to pay for Internet connectivity.

<P>
EFF has been working to ensure that common carrier principles are upheld in
the information age.  Common carrier principles require that network
providers carry all speech, regardless of its controversial content.
Common carriers must also provide all speakers and information providers
with equal, nondiscriminatory access to the network.
<P>
EFF chairs the Digital Security and Privacy Working Group, a coalition of
over 50 organizations--from computer software and hardware firms,
telecommunications and energy companies to civil liberties advocates--that
work on sound privacy policies in telecommunications.  For example, the
group has worked to oppose the FBI's Digital Telephony proposal and
<A NAME="IDX576"></A>
<A NAME="IDX577"></A>
<A NAME="IDX578"></A>
government-mandated encryption policies.
<P>
EFF is working to convince Congress that all measures supporting broader
public access to information should be enacted into law.  EFF supports an
Electronic Freedom of Information Act and other legislation to make
information more accessible to citizens in electronic formats.
<P>
EFF supports both legal and technical means to enhance privacy in
communications.  We, therefore, advocate all measures that ensure the
public's right to use the most effective encryption technologies available.

EFF sponsors legal cases where users' online civil liberties have been
violated.  The Steve Jackson Games case, decided in March of 1993,
established privacy protections for electronic publishers and users of
electronic mail.  We continue to monitor the online community for legal
<A NAME="IDX579"></A>
actions that merit EFF support.
<P>
EFF provides a free telephone hotline for members of the online community
who have questions regarding their legal rights.

state attorney bar associations and university classes on the work that we

EFF, in conjunction with the Consumer Federation of America and the
American Civil Liberties Union, coordinates and sponsors the Communications
Policy Forum (CPF).  CPF enables nonprofit organizations, computer and
communications firms, and government policymakers to come together in a
<A NAME="IDX580"></A>
nonpartisan setting to discuss communications policy goals and strategies.
<P>
EFF works with local organizations that support online communications
issues.  In September of 1993, EFF will cosponsor a cryptography conference
with a group in Austin, Texas.  Earlier this year, EFF sponsored a summit
of groups from around the country to discuss common goals.  We also
participate in an online mailing list for organizations that share our
interests.
<P>
EFF is a funder and organizer of the annual Computers, Freedom and Privacy
conference, where academics, civil libertarians, law enforcement officials
and computer users all meet to discuss the privacy implications of
communicating online.  Each year at the conference, EFF presents its
Pioneer awards to individuals who have made significant contributions to
<A NAME="IDX581"></A>
computer communications.
<P>
EFF maintains several communications forums online.  We have our own
Internet node, eff.org, which houses our FTP and Gopher sites and our
discussion areas, <TT>comp.org.eff.talk</TT> and <TT>comp.org.eff.news</TT>.
EFF also maintains conferences on the <EM>Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link (WELL)</EM>,
<EM>CompuServe</EM> and <EM>America Online</EM>.

<P>Go to the <A HREF="bdg_280.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="bdg_282.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC284" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC284">Networks which are not included</A></H2>
<P>
Networks such as MILNET (U.S. Army) have computers all around the
world. It is generally possible to assume that wherever there is
a U.S. military base, there will be a node reachable through gateways.
<P>
Private company networks such as for DEC (Digital Equipment Corp.),
or Sun Microsystems, for example, have nodes in many exotic locations.
However the connection may take place via UUCP and cost a lot of money.
Those networks have therefore not been included. In addition, those
are PRIVATE networks.
<P>
Many companies (like U.S. Sprint, for example) offer commercial
services to many countries which are not readily available on
the Internet. The service is VERY COSTLY, usually takes place via
UUCP or X.400 connections. X.400 e-mail is usually charged to
someone and if the telecommunication carrier cannot find someone
to pay for the message transfer, it will reject it. As a result,
those types of network have not been included in the list.
Although a user may RECEIVE e-mail from a user on those networks, one
may not be able to reply to it.
<P>
FIDONET nodes are NOT included. While all nodes agree to forward
e-mail as a condition to be included in the tables, the high
cost of phone calls in more exotic locations prompts some
sysadmins not to want their site publicised. Many FIDO nodes
exist throughout the Middle-East and Africa.

<H2><A NAME="SEC288" HREF="bdg_toc.html#SEC288">UK and GB domains</A></H2>
<P>
There are two codes for United Kingdom, namely UK and GB. While
UK is used for addressing of most domains in DNS format, the field
GB is used mainly in the X.400 addressing of United Kingdom sites.
However, there is an increasing trend in some United Kingdom sites
being directly connected to Internet under the GB domain. The GB domain
is hence a perfectly suitable Internet top level domain.

<P>
The following is a compendium of sources that have information that
will be of use to anyone reading this guide.  Some of them were used
in the writing of this guide, while others are simply noted because
<A NAME="IDX588"></A>
they are a must for any good <B>net.citizen</B>'s bookshelf.
<P>
It might also be useful for those, who are interested in the history
of the Internet. Thanks for the better part of this compilation to
<A NAME="IDX589"></A>
<VAR>Henry Edward Hardy</VAR>. It has been stripped from his
Master's Thesis <I>The History of the Net</I> at the School of Communications,
Grand Valley State University, Allendale, MI 49401.
Version 7.2 was posted to <TT>comp.org.eff.talk</TT> on
August 28, 1993.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Version 8.5 of <I>The History of the Net</I> is now available.  This
is exactly the same as the final, archival copy submitted to the
Grand Valley State University Library.  Work will continue to
produce an article, and perhaps also a book, from this material.
I invite continued responses, particularly with reference to the
history of non-American networks.  Corrections or general discussion
are also welcome.
<P>
Please note that this is a draft of an unpublished work, here
presented for purposes of peer review and comment.  Please email
comments, questions and errata to <TT>&lt;seraphim@umcc.umich.edu&gt;</TT>.
<P>
Current copies of this work are be available via
<SAMP>`gopher umcc.umich.edu 1.14.3'</SAMP> and by anon ftp from <B>umcc.umich.edu</B>
<TT>`/pub/seraphim/doc/nethist8.txt'</TT>.
<P>
I put a Mac Word and a postscript version of the text in the anon FTP
directory if you would like a pretty version.  A printed and bound
(in one of those $3 hard 2-hole report binders) edition, numbered
and signed by the author, is also available for $.  Email me for
details.
<P>
Thanks, --HH <TT>&lt;seraphim@umcc.umich.edu&gt;</TT>

<TITLE>Zen and the Art of the Internet - Acknowledgements</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="zen-1.0_2.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H1><A NAME="SEC0" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC0">Preface</A></H1>
<P>
The composition of this booklet was originally started because the
Computer Science department at Widener University was in desperate
need of documentation describing the capabilities of this "great new
Internet link" we obtained.
<P>
It's since grown into an effort to acquaint the reader with much of
what's currently available over the Internet.  Aimed at the novice
user, it attempts to remain operating system "neutral"---little
information herein is specific to Unix, VMS, or any other environment.
This booklet will, hopefully, be usable by nearly anyone.
<P>
Some typographical conventions are maintained throughout this guide.
All abstract items like possible filenames, usernames, etc., are all
represented in <VAR>italics</VAR>.  Likewise, definite filenames and email
addresses are represented in a quoted <SAMP>`typewriter'</SAMP> font.  A
user's session is usually offset from the rest of the paragraph, as
such:
<P>
<PRE>
prompt&#62; command
     The results are usually displayed here.
</PRE>
<P>
The purpose of this booklet is two-fold: first, it's intended to serve
as a reference piece, which someone can easily grab on the fly and
look something up.  Also, it forms a foundation from which people can
explore the vast expanse of the Internet.  <CITE>Zen and the Art of
the Internet</CITE> doesn't spend a significant amount of time on any one
point; rather, it provides enough for people to learn the specifics of
what his or her local system offers.
<P>
One warning is perhaps in order--this territory we are entering can
become a fantastic time-sink.  Hours can slip by, people can come and
go, and you'll be locked into Cyberspace.  Remember to do your work!
<A NAME="IDX1"></A>
<P>
With that, I welcome you, the new user, to The Net.

<P>
Certain sections in this booklet are not my original work--rather,
they are derived from documents that were available on the Internet
and already aptly stated their areas of concentration.  The chapter on
Usenet is, in large part, made up of what's posted monthly to
<CODE>news.announce.newusers</CODE>, with some editing and rewriting.  Also,
the main section on <VAR>archie</VAR> was derived from <TT>`whatis.archie'</TT>
by Peter Deutsch of the McGill University Computing Centre.  It's
available via anonymous FTP from <CODE>archie.mcgill.ca</CODE>.  Much of
what's in the telnet section came from an impressive introductory
document put together by SuraNet.  Some definitions in the one are
from an excellent glossary put together by Colorado State University.
<P>
This guide would not be the same without the aid of many people on The
Net, and the providers of resources that are already out there.  I'd
like to thank the folks who gave this a read-through and returned some
excellent comments, suggestions, and criticisms, and those who
provided much-needed information on the fly.  Glee Willis deserves
particular mention for all of his work; this guide would have been
considerably less polished without his help.

<TITLE>Zen and the Art of the Internet - Network Basics</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="zen-1.0_1.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="zen-1.0_3.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H1><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC2">Network Basics</A></H1>
<UL>
</UL>
<P>
We are truly in an information society.  Now more than ever, moving
vast amounts of information quickly across great distances is one of our
most pressing needs.  From small one-person entrepreneurial efforts,
to the largest of corporations, more and more professional people are
discovering that the only way to be successful in the '90s and beyond
is to realize that technology is advancing at a break-neck pace--and
they must somehow keep up.  Likewise, researchers from all corners of
the earth are finding that their work thrives in a networked
environment.  Immediate access to the work of colleagues and a
"virtual" library of millions of volumes and thousands of papers
affords them the ability to encorporate a body of knowledge heretofore
unthinkable.  Work groups can now conduct interactive conferences with
each other, paying no heed to physical location--the
possibilities are endless.
<P>
You have at your fingertips the ability to talk in "real-time"
with someone in Japan, send a 2,000-word short story to a group
of people who will critique it for the sheer pleasure of doing so, see
if a Macintosh sitting in a lab in Canada is turned on, and find out
if someone happens to be sitting in front of their computer
(<DFN>logged on</DFN>) in Australia, all inside of thirty minutes.  No
airline (or tardis, for that matter) could ever match that travel
itinerary.
<P>
The largest problem people face when first using a network is grasping
all that's available.  Even seasoned users find themselves surprised
when they discover a new service or feature that they'd never known
even existed.  Once acquainted with the terminology and sufficiently
comfortable with making occasional mistakes, the learning process will
drastically speed up.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC3">Domains</A></H2>
<A NAME="IDX2"></A>
<P>
Getting where you want to go can often be one of the more difficult
aspects of using networks.  The variety of ways that places are named
will probably leave a blank stare on your face at first.  Don't fret;
there is a method to this apparent madness.
<P>
If someone were to ask for a home address, they would probably expect
a street, apartment, city, state, and zip code.  That's all the
information the post office needs to deliver mail in a reasonably
speedy fashion.  Likewise, computer addresses have a structure to
them.  The general form is:
<P>
<PRE>
<VAR>a person's email address on a computer:</VAR> user@somewhere.domain
<VAR>a computer's name:</VAR> somewhere.domain
</PRE>
<P>
The <VAR>user</VAR> portion is usually the person's account name on the
system, though it doesn't have to be.  <VAR>somewhere.domain</VAR> tells
you the name of a system or location, and what kind of organization it
is. The trailing <VAR>domain</VAR> is often one of the following:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>com</CODE>
<DD>Usually a company or other commercial institution or organization,
like Convex Computers (<SAMP>`convex.com'</SAMP>).
<P>
<DT><CODE>edu</CODE>
<DD>An educational institution, e.g. New York University, named <SAMP>`nyu.edu'</SAMP>.
<P>
<DT><CODE>gov</CODE>
<DD>A government site; for example, NASA is <SAMP>`nasa.gov'</SAMP>.
<P>
<DT><CODE>mil</CODE>
<DD>A military site, like the Air Force (<SAMP>`af.mil'</SAMP>).
<P>
<DT><CODE>net</CODE>
<DD>Gateways and other administrative hosts for a
network (it does <EM>not</EM> mean all of the hosts in a
network).<A NAME="FOOT1" HREF="zen-1.0_foot.html#FOOT1">(1)</A>  One such gateway is
<SAMP>`near.net'</SAMP>.
<P>
<DT><CODE>org</CODE>
<DD>
This is a domain reserved for private organizations, who don't
comfortably fit in the other classes of domains.  One example is the
<A NAME="IDX3">Electronic Frontier Foundation</A>
(see section <A HREF="zen-1.0_9.html#SEC95">The Electronic Frontier Foundation</A>), named <SAMP>`eff.org'</SAMP>.
</DL>
<P>
Each country also has its own top-level domain.  For example, the
<CODE>us</CODE> domain includes each of the fifty states.  Other countries
represented with domains include:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><CODE>au</CODE>
<DD>Australia
<DT><CODE>ca</CODE>
<DD>Canada
<DT><CODE>fr</CODE>
<DD>France
<DT><CODE>uk</CODE>
<DD>The United Kingdom.  These also have sub-domains of things like
<SAMP>`ac.uk'</SAMP> for academic sites and <SAMP>`co.uk'</SAMP> for commercial ones.
</DL>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX4"></A>
The proper terminology for a site's domain name
(<VAR>somewhere.domain</VAR> above) is its <DFN>Fully Qualified Domain
Name</DFN> (FQDN).  It is usually selected to give a clear indication of
the site's organization or sponsoring agent.  For example, the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology's FQDN is <SAMP>`mit.edu'</SAMP>;
similarly, Apple Computer's domain name is <SAMP>`apple.com'</SAMP>.  While
such obvious names are usually the norm, there are the occasional
exceptions that are ambiguous enough to mislead--like <SAMP>`vt.edu'</SAMP>,
which on first impulse one might surmise is an educational institution
of some sort in Vermont; not so.  It's actually the domain name for
Virginia Tech.  In most cases it's relatively easy to glean the
meaning of a domain name--such confusion is far from the norm.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC4" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC4">Internet Numbers</A></H2>
<A NAME="IDX6"></A>
<P>
Every single machine on the Internet has a unique address,<A NAME="FOOT2" HREF="zen-1.0_foot.html#FOOT2">(2)</A> called its
<A NAME="IDX5"><DFN>Internet number</DFN></A>
or <DFN>IP Address</DFN>.  It's
actually a 32-bit number, but is most commonly represented as four
numbers joined by periods (<SAMP>`.'</SAMP>), like <CODE>147.31.254.130</CODE>.
This is sometimes also called a <DFN>dotted quad</DFN>; there are literally
thousands of different possible dotted quads.  The ARPAnet (the mother
to today's Internet) originally only had the capacity to have up to
256 systems on it because of the way each system was addressed.  In
the early eighties, it became clear that things would fast outgrow
such a small limit; the 32-bit addressing method was born, freeing
thousands of host numbers.
<P>
Each piece of an Internet address (like <CODE>192</CODE>) is called an
<A NAME="IDX7">"octet"</A>
, representing one of four sets of eight bits.  The first two
or three pieces (e.g. <CODE>192.55.239</CODE>) represent the network that a
system is on, called its
<A NAME="IDX8"><DFN>subnet</DFN></A>.
For example, all of the
computers for Wesleyan University are in the subnet <CODE>129.133</CODE>.
They can have numbers like <CODE>129.133.10.10</CODE>, <CODE>129.133.230.19</CODE>,
up to 65 thousand possible combinations (possible computers).
<P>
IP addresses and domain names aren't assigned arbitrarily--that would
lead to unbelievable confusion.  An application must be filed with the
Network Information Center (NIC), either electronically (to
<CODE>hostmaster@nic.ddn.mil</CODE>) or via regular mail.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC5">Resolving Names and Numbers</A></H2>
<A NAME="IDX9"></A>
Ok, computers can be referred to by either their FQDN or their
Internet address.  How can one user be expected to remember them all?
<P>
They aren't.  The Internet is designed so that one can use either
method.  Since humans find it much more natural to deal with words
than numbers in most cases, the
<A NAME="IDX11">FQDN</A>
for each host is mapped to its
Internet number.  Each domain is <DFN>served</DFN> by a computer within
that domain, which provides all of the necessary information to go
from a domain name to an IP address, and vice-versa.  For example,
when someone refers to <CODE>foosun.bar.com</CODE>, the <DFN>resolver</DFN> knows
that it should ask the system <CODE>foovax.bar.com</CODE> about systems in
<CODE>bar.com</CODE>.  It asks what Internet address <CODE>foosun.bar.com</CODE>
has; if the name <CODE>foosun.bar.com</CODE> really exists, <CODE>foovax</CODE>
will send back its number.  All of this "magic" happens behind the
scenes.
<A NAME="IDX10"></A>
<P>
Rarely will a user have to remember the Internet number of a site
(although often you'll catch yourself remembering an apparently
obscure number, simply because you've accessed the system frequently).
However, you will remember a substantial number of
FQDNs.  It will eventually reach a point when you are able to make a
reasonably accurate guess at what domain name a certain college,
university, or company might have, given just their name.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC6">The Networks</A></H2>
<UL>
</UL>
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><DFN>Internet</DFN>
<DD>The Internet is a large "network of networks."  There is no
one network known as The Internet; rather, regional nets like SuraNet,
PrepNet, NearNet, et al., are all inter-connected
(nay, "inter-networked") together into one great living thing,
communicating at amazing speeds with the TCP/IP protocol.  All
activity takes place in "real-time."
<P>
<DT><DFN>UUCP</DFN>
<DD><A NAME="IDX12"></A>
The UUCP network is a loose association of systems all communicating
with the <SAMP>`UUCP'</SAMP> protocol.  (UUCP stands for `Unix-to-Unix Copy
Program'.)  It's based on two systems connecting to each other at
specified intervals, called <DFN>polling</DFN>, and executing any work
scheduled for either of them.  Historically most UUCP was done with
Unix equipment, although the software's since been implemented on
other platforms (e.g. VMS).  For example, the system <VAR>oregano</VAR>
polls the system <VAR>basil</VAR> once every two hours.  If there's any
mail waiting for <VAR>oregano</VAR>, <VAR>basil</VAR> will send it at that time;
likewise, <VAR>oregano</VAR> will at that time send any jobs waiting for
<VAR>basil</VAR>.
<P>
<DT><DFN>BITNET</DFN>
<DD><A NAME="IDX13">BITNET</A>
(the "Because It's Time Network") is comprised of systems
connected by <DFN>point-to-point</DFN> links, all running the
<A NAME="IDX14">NJE protocol</A>
.
It's continued to grow, but has found itself suffering at the hands of
the falling costs of Internet connections.  Also, a number of mail
gateways are in place to reach users on other networks.
</DL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC7">The Physical Connection</A></H2>
<P>
The actual connections between the various networks take a variety of
forms.  The most prevalent for Internet links are <DFN>56k 
<A NAME="IDX15">leased lines</A>
</DFN> (dedicated telephone lines carrying 56kilobit-per-second
connections) and <DFN>T1 links</DFN> (special phone lines with 1Mbps
connections).  Also installed are <DFN>T3 links</DFN>, acting as backbones
between major locations to carry a massive 45Mbps load of traffic.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX16"></A>
These links are paid for by each institution to a local carrier (for
example, Bell Atlantic owns PrepNet, the main provider in
Pennsylvania).  Also available are <DFN>SLIP</DFN> connections, which carry
Internet traffic (packets) over high-speed modems.
<P>
UUCP links are made with modems (for the most part), that run from
1200 baud all the way up to as high as 38.4Kbps.  As was mentioned in
section <A HREF="zen-1.0_2.html#SEC6">The Networks</A>, the connections are of the <DFN>store-and-forward</DFN>
variety.  Also in use are Internet-based UUCP links (as if things
weren't already confusing enough!).  The systems do their UUCP traffic
over TCP/IP connections, which give the UUCP-based network some
blindingly fast "hops," resulting in better connectivity for the
network as a whole.  UUCP connections first became popular in the
1970's, and have remained in wide-spread use ever since.  Only with
UUCP can Joe Smith correspond with someone across the country or
around the world, for the price of a local telephone call.
<P>
BITNET links mostly take the form of 9600bps modems connected from site
to site.  Often places have three or more links going; the majority,
however, look to "upstream" sites for their sole link to the network.

<UL>
</UL>
<P>
The desire to communicate is the essence of networking.  People have
always wanted to correspond with each other in the fastest way
possible, short of normal conversation.
<A NAME="IDX17">Electronic mail</A>
(or <DFN>email</DFN>) is the most prevalent application of this in computer
networking.  It allows people to write back and forth without having
to spend much time worrying about how the message actually gets
delivered.  As technology grows closer and closer to being a common
part of daily life, the need to understand the many ways it can be
utilized and how it works, at least to some level, is vital.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC9">Email Addresses</A></H2>
<UL>
</UL>
<P>
Electronic mail is hinged around the concept of an <DFN>address</DFN>; the
section on Networking Basics made some reference to it while
introducing domains.  Your <DFN>email address</DFN> provides all of the
information required to get a message to you from anywhere in the
world.  An address doesn't necessarily have to go to a human being.
It could be an archive server,<A NAME="FOOT3" HREF="zen-1.0_foot.html#FOOT3">(3)</A> a list of people, or even someone's pocket pager.  These
cases are the exception to the norm--mail to most addresses is read
by human beings.
<A NAME="IDX18"></A>
<A NAME="IDX19"></A>
<A NAME="IDX20"></A>
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC10" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC10">%@!.: Symbolic Cacophony</A></H3>
<P>
Email addresses usually appear in one of two forms--using the
Internet format which contains <SAMP>`@'</SAMP>, an "at"-sign, or using the
UUCP format which contains <SAMP>`!'</SAMP>, an exclamation point, also called
a "bang."  The latter of the two, UUCP
<A NAME="IDX21">"bang" paths,</A>
is more
restrictive, yet more clearly dictates how the mail will travel.
<A NAME="IDX22"></A>
<P>
To reach Jim Morrison on the system <CODE>south.america.org</CODE>, one
would address the mail as <SAMP>`jm@south.america.org'</SAMP>.  But if Jim's
account was on a UUCP site named <CODE>brazil</CODE>, then his address
would be <SAMP>`brazil!jm'</SAMP>.  If it's possible (and one exists), try to
use the Internet form of an address; bang paths can fail if an
intermediate site in the path happens to be down.  There is a growing
trend for UUCP sites to register Internet domain names, to help
alleviate the problem of path failures.
<A NAME="IDX23"></A>
<P>
Another symbol that enters the fray is <SAMP>`%'</SAMP>---it acts as an extra
"routing" method.  For example, if the UUCP site <CODE>dream</CODE> is
connected to <CODE>south.america.org</CODE>, but doesn't have an Internet
domain name of its own, a user <CODE>debbie</CODE> on <CODE>dream</CODE> can be
reached by writing to the address
<PRE>
debbie%dream@south.america.org
</PRE>
<P>
The form is significant.  This address says that the local system
should first send the mail to <CODE>south.america.org</CODE>.  There the
address <CODE>debbie%dream</CODE> will turn into <CODE>debbie@dream</CODE>, which
will hopefully be a valid address.  Then <CODE>south.america.org</CODE> will
handle getting the mail to the host <CODE>dream</CODE>, where it will be
delivered locally to <CODE>debbie</CODE>.
<P>
All of the intricacies of email addressing methods are fully covered
in the book <CITE>!%@:: A Directory of Electronic Mail Addressing and
Networks</CITE> published by O'Reilly and Associates, as part of their
<A NAME="IDX24">Nutshell Handbook</A>
series.  It is a must for any active email user.

<P>
We'll make one quick diversion from being OS-neuter here, to show you
what it will look like to send and receive a mail message on a Unix
system.  Check with your system administrator for specific
instructions related to mail at your site.
<P>
A person sending the author mail would probably do something like this:
<PRE>
% mail brendan@cs.widener.edu
Subject: print job's stuck

I typed `print babe.gif' and it didn't work! Why??
</PRE>
<P>
The next time the author checked his mail, he would see it listed in
his mailbox as:
<P>
<PRE>
% mail
"/usr/spool/mail/brendan": 1 messages 1 new 1 unread
 U  1 joeuser@foo.widene Tue May  5 20:36   29/956   print job's stuck
?
</PRE>
<P>
which gives information on the sender of the email, when it was sent,
and the subject of the message.  He would probably use the
<SAMP>`reply'</SAMP> command of Unix mail to send this response:

You shouldn't print binary files like GIFs to a printer!

don't oversleep this time.
</PRE>
<P>
The first line, with <SAMP>`From'</SAMP> and the two lines for
<SAMP>`Received:'</SAMP> are usually not very interesting.  They give the
"real" address that the mail is coming from (as opposed to the
address you should reply to, which may look much different), and what
places the mail went through to get to you.  Over the Internet, there
is always at least one <SAMP>`Received:'</SAMP> header and usually no more
than four or five.  When a message is sent using UUCP, one
<SAMP>`Received:'</SAMP> header is added for each system that the mail passes
through.  This can often result in more than a dozen <SAMP>`Received:'</SAMP>
headers.  While they help with dissecting problems in mail delivery,
odds are the average user will never want to see them.  Most mail
programs will filter out this kind of "cruft" in a header.
<A NAME="IDX27"></A>
<P>
The <SAMP>`Date:'</SAMP> header contains the date and time the message was
sent.  Likewise, the "good" address (as opposed to "real" address)
is laid out in the <SAMP>`From:'</SAMP> header.  Sometimes it won't include
the full name of the person (in this case <SAMP>`The President'</SAMP>), and
may look different, but it should always contain an email address of
some form.
<P>
The <SAMP>`Message-ID:'</SAMP> of a message is intended mainly for tracing
mail routing, and is rarely of interest to normal users.  Every
<SAMP>`Message-ID:'</SAMP> is guaranteed to be unique.
<P>
<SAMP>`To:'</SAMP> lists the email address (or addresses) of the recipients of
the message.  There may be a <SAMP>`Cc:'</SAMP> header, listing additional
addresses.  Finally, a brief subject for the message goes in the
<SAMP>`Subject:'</SAMP> header.
<P>
The exact order of a message's headers may vary from system to system,
but it will always include these fundamental headers that are vital to
proper delivery.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC13" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC13">Bounced Mail</A></H3>
<A NAME="IDX28"></A>
<P>
When an email address is incorrect in some way (the system's name is
wrong, the domain doesn't exist, whatever), the mail system will
<A NAME="IDX29"><DFN>bounce</DFN></A>
the message back to the sender, much the same way that
the Postal Service does when you send a letter to a bad street
address.  The message will include the reason for the bounce; a common
error is addressing mail to an account name that doesn't exist.  For
example, writing to Lisa Simpson at Widener University's Computer
Science department will fail, because she doesn't have an
account.<A NAME="FOOT5" HREF="zen-1.0_foot.html#FOOT5">(5)</A>

<P>
As you can see, a carbon copy of the message (the <SAMP>`Cc:'</SAMP> header
entry) was sent to the postmaster of Widener's CS department.  The
<DFN>Postmaster</DFN> is responsible for maintaining a reliable mail system
on his system.  Usually postmasters at sites will attempt to aid you
in getting your mail where it's supposed to go.  If a typing error was
made, then try re-sending the message.  If you're sure that the
address is correct, contact the postmaster of the site directly and
ask him how to properly address it.
<A NAME="IDX31"></A>
<P>
The message also includes the text of the mail, so you don't have to
retype everything you wrote.

</PRE>
<P>
The full text of the message is returned intact, including any headers
that were added.  This can be cut out with an editor and fed right
back into the mail system with a proper address, making redelivery a
relatively painless process.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC14" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC14">Mailing Lists</A></H2>
<P>
People that share common interests are inclined to discuss their hobby
or interest at every available opportunity.  One modern way to aid in
this exchange of information is by using a
<A NAME="IDX32"><DFN>mailing list</DFN></A>
---usually an email address that redistributes all mail sent to
it back out to a list of addresses.  For example, the
<A NAME="IDX34">Sun Managers</A>
mailing list (of interest to people that administer computers
manufactured by Sun) has the address
<SAMP>`sun-managers@eecs.nwu.edu'</SAMP>.  Any mail sent to that address will
"explode" out to each person named in a file maintained on a
computer at Northwestern University.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX33"></A>
Administrative tasks (sometimes referred to as
<DFN>administrivia</DFN>)
are often handled through other addresses, typically with the suffix
<SAMP>`-request'</SAMP>.  To continue the above, a request to be added to or
deleted from the Sun Managers list should be sent to
<SAMP>`sun-managers-request@eecs.nwu.edu'</SAMP>.
<P>
When in doubt, try to write to the <SAMP>`-request'</SAMP> version of a
mailing list address first; the other people on the list aren't
interested in your desire to be added or deleted, and can certainly do
nothing to expedite your request.  Often if the administrator of a
list is busy (remember, this is all peripheral to real jobs and real
work), many users find it necessary to ask again and again, often with
harsher and harsher language, to be removed from a list.  This does
nothing more than waste traffic and bother everyone else receiving the
messages.  If, after a reasonable amount of time, you still
haven't succeeded to be removed from a mailing list, write to the
postmaster at that site and see if they can help.
<A NAME="IDX35"></A>
<P>
Exercise caution when replying to a message sent by a mailing list.  If
you wish to respond to the author only, make <EM>sure</EM> that the only
address you're replying to is that person, and not the entire list.
Often messages of the sort "Yes, I agree with you completely!" will
appear on a list, boring the daylights out of the other readers.  Likewise,
if you explicitly do want to send the message to the whole list,
you'll save yourself some time by checking to make sure it's indeed
headed to the whole list and not a single person.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX36"></A>
A list of the currently available mailing lists is available in at
least two places; the first is in a file on <CODE>ftp.nisc.sri.com</CODE>
called <TT>`interest-groups'</TT> under the <TT>`netinfo/'</TT> directory.
It's updated fairly regularly, but is large (presently around 700K),
so only get it every once in a while.  The other list is maintained by
Gene Spafford (<CODE>spaf@cs.purdue.edu</CODE>), and is posted in parts to
the newsgroup <CODE>news.lists</CODE> semi-regularly. (See section <A HREF="zen-1.0_5.html#SEC30">Usenet News</A>,
for info on how to read that and other newsgroups.)
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC15" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC15">Listservs</A></H3>
<A NAME="IDX37"></A>
<P>
On BITNET there's an automated system for maintaining discussion lists
called the <DFN>listserv</DFN>.  Rather than have an already harried and
overworked human take care of additions and removals from a list, a
program performs these and other tasks by responding to a set of
user-driven commands.
<P>
Areas of interest are wide and varied--ETHICS-L deals with ethics in
computing, while ADND-L has to do with a role-playing game.  A full
list of the available BITNET lists can be obtained by writing to
<SAMP>`LISTSERV@BITNIC.BITNET'</SAMP> with a body containing the command
<P>
<PRE>
list global
</PRE>
<P>
However, be sparing in your use of this--see if it's already on your
system somewhere.  The reply is quite large.
<P>
The most fundamental command is <SAMP>`subscribe'</SAMP>.  It will tell the
listserv to add the sender to a specific list.  The usage is
<P>
<PRE>
subscribe foo-l <VAR>Your Real Name</VAR>
</PRE>
<P>
It will respond with a message either saying that you've been added to
the list, or that the request has been passed on to the system on
which the list is actually maintained.
<P>
The mate to <SAMP>`subscribe'</SAMP> is, naturally, <SAMP>`unsubscribe'</SAMP>.  It
will remove a given address from a BITNET list.  It, along with all
other listserv commands, can be abbreviated---<SAMP>`subscribe'</SAMP> as
<SAMP>`sub'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`unsubscribe'</SAMP> as <SAMP>`unsub'</SAMP>, etc.  For a full list
of the available listserv commands, write to
<SAMP>`LISTSERV@BITNIC.BITNET'</SAMP>, giving it the command
<SAMP><A NAME="IDX38">`help'</A></SAMP>.
<A NAME="IDX39"></A>
<P>
As an aside, there have been implementations of the listserv system
for non-BITNET hosts (more specifically, Unix systems).  One of the
most complete is available on <CODE>cs.bu.edu</CODE> in the
directory <TT>`pub/listserv'</TT>.

<TITLE>Zen and the Art of the Internet - Anonymous FTP</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="zen-1.0_3.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="zen-1.0_5.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H1><A NAME="SEC16" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC16">Anonymous FTP</A></H1>
<P>
FTP (<DFN>File Transfer Protocol</DFN>) is the primary method of
transferring files over the Internet.  On many systems, it's also the
name of the program that implements the protocol. Given proper
permission, it's possible to copy a file from a computer in South
Africa to one in Los Angeles at very fast speeds (on the order of
5--10K per second).  This normally requires either a user id on both
systems or a special configuration set up by the system
administrator(s).
<P>
There is a good way around this restriction--the <DFN>anonymous FTP</DFN>
service.  It essentially will let anyone in the world have access to a
certain area of disk space in a non-threatening way.  With this,
people can make files publicly available with little hassle.  Some
systems have dedicated entire disks or even entire computers to
maintaining extensive archives of source code and information.  They
include <CODE>gatekeeper.dec.com</CODE> (Digital),
<CODE>wuarchive.wustl.edu</CODE> (Washington University in Saint Louis), and
<CODE>archive.cis.ohio-state.edu</CODE> (The Ohio State University).
<P>
The process involves the "foreign" user (someone not on the system
itself) creating an FTP connection and logging into the system as the
user <SAMP>`anonymous'</SAMP>, with an arbitrary password:
<PRE>
Name (foo.site.com:you): anonymous
Password: <KBD>jm@south.america.org</KBD>
</PRE>
<P>
Custom and netiquette dictate that people respond to the
<CODE>Password:</CODE> query with an email address so that the sites can
track the level of FTP usage, if they desire.  (See section <A HREF="zen-1.0_3.html#SEC9">Email Addresses</A> for
information on email addresses).
<P>
The speed of the transfer depends on the speed of the underlying link.
A site that has a 9600bps
<A NAME="IDX41">SLIP</A>
connection will not get the same
throughput as a system with a 56k leased line (see section <A HREF="zen-1.0_2.html#SEC7">The Physical Connection</A>, for more on what kinds of connections can exist in a
network).  Also, the traffic of all other users on that link will
affect performance.  If there are thirty people all FTPing from one
site simultaneously, the load on the system (in addition to the
network connection) will degrade the overall throughput of the
transfer.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC17" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC17">FTP Etiquette</A></H2>
<P>
Lest we forget, the Internet is there for people to do work.  People
using the network and the systems on it are doing so for a purpose,
whether it be research, development, whatever.  Any heavy activity
takes away from the overall performance of the network as a whole.
<P>
The effects of an FTP connection on a site and its link can vary; the
general rule of thumb is that any extra traffic created detracts from
the ability of that site's users to perform their tasks.  To help be
considerate of this, it's <EM>highly</EM> recommended that FTP sessions
be held only after normal business hours for that site, preferably
late at night.  The possible effects of a large transfer will be less
destructive at 2 a.m. than 2 p.m.  Also, remember that if it's past
dinner time in Maine, it's still early afternoon in California--think
in terms of the current time at the site that's being visited, not of
local time.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC18" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC18">Basic Commands</A></H2>
<P>
While there have been many extensions to the various FTP clients out
there, there is a de facto "standard" set that everyone expects to
work.  For more specific information, read the manual for your
specific FTP program.  This section will only skim the bare minimum of
commands needed to operate an FTP session.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC19" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC19">Creating the Connection</A></H3>
<P>
The actual command to use FTP will vary among operating systems; for
the sake of clarity, we'll use <SAMP>`FTP'</SAMP> here, since it's the most
general form.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX42"></A>
<A NAME="IDX43"></A>
There are two ways to connect to a system--using its <DFN>hostname</DFN>
or its Internet number.  Using the hostname is usually preferred.
However, some sites aren't able to <DFN>resolve</DFN> hostnames properly,
and have no alternative.  We'll assume you're able to use hostnames
for simplicity's sake.  The form is
<P>
<PRE>
<KBD>ftp <VAR>somewhere.domain</VAR></KBD>
</PRE>
<P>
See section <A HREF="zen-1.0_2.html#SEC3">Domains</A> for help with reading and using domain names
(in the example below, <VAR>somewhere.domain</VAR> is <CODE>ftp.uu.net</CODE>).
<P>
<A NAME="IDX44"></A>
You must first know the name of the system you want to connect to.
We'll use <SAMP>`ftp.uu.net'</SAMP> as an example.  On your system, type:
<PRE>
ftp ftp.uu.net
</PRE>
(the actual syntax will vary depending on the type of system the
connection's being made from).  It will pause momentarily then respond
with the message
<PRE>
Connected to ftp.uu.net.
</PRE>
<P>
and an initial prompt will appear:
<P>
<PRE>
220 uunet FTP server (Version 5.100 Mon Feb 11 17:13:28 EST 1991) ready.
Name (ftp.uu.net:jm):
</PRE>
<P>
to which you should respond with <KBD>anonymous</KBD>:
<P>
<PRE>
220 uunet FTP server (Version 5.100 Mon Feb 11 17:13:28 EST 1991) ready.
Name (ftp.uu.net:jm): <KBD>anonymous</KBD>
</PRE>
<P>
The system will then prompt you for a password; as noted previously, a
good response is your email address:
<P>
<PRE>
331 Guest login ok, send ident as password.
Password: <VAR>jm@south.america.org</VAR>
230 Guest login ok, access restrictions apply.
ftp&#62;
</PRE>
<P>
The password itself will not echo.  This is to protect a user's
security when he or she is using a real account to FTP files between
machines.  Once you reach the <CODE>ftp&#62;</CODE> prompt, you know you're
logged in and ready to go.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC20" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC20"><KBD>dir</KBD></A></H3>
At the <SAMP>`ftp&#62;'</SAMP> prompt, you can type a number of commands to perform
various functions.  One example is <SAMP>`dir'</SAMP>---it will list the files
in the current directory. Continuing the example from above:
<P>
<PRE>
ftp&#62; <KBD>dir</KBD>

200 PORT command successful.

</PRE>
<P>
The file <TT>`newthisweek.Z'</TT> was specifically included because we'll
be using it later.  Just for general information, it happens to be a
listing of all of the files added to UUNET's archives during the past
week.
<P>
The directory shown is on a machine running the Unix operating
system--the <KBD>dir</KBD> command will produce different results on other
operating systems (e.g. TOPS, VMS, et al.).  Learning to recognize
different formats will take some time.  After a few weeks of
traversing the Internet, it proves easier to see, for example, how
large a file is on an operating system you're otherwise not acquainted
with.
<P>
With many FTP implementations, it's also possible to take the output
of <KBD>dir</KBD> and put it into a file on the local system with
<PRE>
ftp&#62; <KBD>dir n* <VAR>outfilename</VAR></KBD>
</PRE>
<P>
the contents of which can then be read outside of the live FTP
connection; this is particularly useful for systems with very long
directories (like <CODE>ftp.uu.net</CODE>).  The above example would put the
names of every file that begins with an <SAMP>`n'</SAMP> into the local file
<VAR>outfilename</VAR>.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC21" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC21"><KBD>cd</KBD></A></H3>
<P>
At the beginning of an FTP session, the user is in a "top-level"
directory.  Most things are in directories below it (e.g. <TT>`/pub'</TT>).  To
change the current directory, one uses the <KBD>cd</KBD> command.  To
change to the directory <TT>`pub'</TT>, for example, one would type
<P>
<PRE>
ftp&#62; <KBD>cd pub</KBD>
</PRE>
<P>
which would elicit the response
<P>
<PRE>
250 CWD command successful.
</PRE>
<P>
Meaning the "Change Working Directory" command (<SAMP>`cd'</SAMP>) worked
properly.  Moving "up" a directory is more system-specific--in Unix
use the command <SAMP>`cd ..'</SAMP>, and in VMS, <SAMP>`cd [-]'</SAMP>.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC22" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC22"><KBD>get</KBD> and <KBD>put</KBD></A></H3>
<P>
The actual transfer is performed with the <KBD>get</KBD> and <KBD>put</KBD>
commands.  To <DFN>get</DFN> a file from the remote computer to the local
system, the command takes the form:
<P>
<PRE>
ftp&#62; <KBD>get</KBD> <VAR>filename</VAR>
</PRE>
<P>
where <VAR>filename</VAR> is the file on the remote system.  Again using
<CODE>ftp.uu.net</CODE> as an example, the file <TT>`newthisweek.Z'</TT> can be
retrieved with
<P>
<PRE>
ftp&#62; <KBD>get newthisweek.Z</KBD>
200 PORT command successful.
150 Opening ASCII mode data connection for newthisweek.Z (42390 bytes).
226 Transfer complete.
local: newthisweek.Z remote: newthisweek.Z
42553 bytes received in 6.9 seconds (6 Kbytes/s)
ftp&#62;
</PRE>
<P>
The section below on using binary mode instead of
ASCII will describe why this particular choice will result in a
corrupt and subsequently unusable file.
<P>
If, for some reason, you want to save a file under a different name
(e.g. your system can only have 14-character filenames, or can only
have one dot in the name), you can specify what the local filename
should be by providing <KBD>get</KBD> with an additional argument
<PRE>
ftp&#62; <KBD>get newthisweek.Z uunet-new</KBD>
</PRE>
<P>
which will place the contents of the file <TT>`newthisweek.Z'</TT> in
<TT>`uunet-new'</TT> on the local system.
<P>
The transfer works the other way, too.  The <KBD>put</KBD> command will
transfer a file from the local system to the remote system.  If the
permissions are set up for an FTP session to write to a remote
directory, a file can be sent with
<P>
<PRE>
ftp&#62; <KBD>put filename</KBD>
</PRE>
<P>
As with <KBD>get</KBD>, <KBD>put</KBD> will take a third argument, letting you
specify a different name for the file on the remote system.
<P>
<H4><A NAME="SEC23" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC23">ASCII vs Binary</A></H4>
<P>
In the example above, the file <TT>`newthisweek.Z'</TT> was transferred,
but supposedly not correctly.  The reason is this: in a normal ASCII
transfer (the default), certain characters are translated between
systems, to help make text files more readable.  However, when
<DFN>binary</DFN> files (those containing non-ASCII characters) are
transferred, this translation should <EM>not</EM> take place.  One
example is a binary program--a few changed characters can render it
completely useless.
<P>
To avoid this problem, it's possible to be in one of two modes---<DFN>ASCII</DFN>
or <DFN>binary</DFN>.  In binary mode, the file isn't translated in any way.
What's on the remote system is precisely what's received.  The
commands to go between the two modes are:
<P>
<PRE>
ftp&#62; <KBD>ascii</KBD>
200 Type set to A.   <EM>(Note the <STRONG>A</STRONG>, which signifies ASCII mode.)</EM>

ftp&#62; <KBD>binary</KBD>
200 Type set to I.   <EM>(Set to <STRONG>I</STRONG>mage format, for pure binary transfers.)</EM>
</PRE>
<P>
Note that each command need only be done once to take effect; if the
user types <KBD>binary</KBD>, all transfers in that session are done in
binary mode (that is, unless <KBD>ascii</KBD> is typed later).
<P>
The transfer of <TT>`newthisweek.Z'</TT> will work if done as:
<P>
<PRE>
ftp&#62; <KBD>binary</KBD>
200 Type set to I.
ftp&#62; <KBD>get newthisweek.Z</KBD>
200 PORT command successful.
150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for newthisweek.Z (42390 bytes).
226 Transfer complete.

42390 bytes received in 7.2 seconds (5.8 Kbytes/s)
</PRE>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> The file size (42390) is different from that done
in ASCII mode (42553) bytes; and the number 42390 matches the one
in the listing of UUNET's top directory.  We can be relatively sure
that we've received the file without any problems.

<P>
<H4><A NAME="SEC24" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC24"><KBD>mget</KBD> and <KBD>mput</KBD></A></H4>
<P>
The commands <KBD>mget</KBD> and <KBD>mput</KBD> allow for multiple file
transfers using wildcards to get several files, or a whole set of
files at once, rather than having to do it manually one by one.  For
example, to get all files that begin with the letter <SAMP>`f'</SAMP>, one
would type
<P>
<PRE>
ftp&#62; <KBD>mget f*</KBD>
</PRE>
<P>
Similarly, to put all of the local files that end with <CODE>.c</CODE>:
<P>
<PRE>
ftp&#62; <KBD>mput *.c</KBD>
</PRE>
<P>
Rather than reiterate what's been written a hundred times before,
consult a local manual for more information on wildcard matching
(every DOS manual, for example, has a section on it).
<P>
Normally, FTP assumes a user wants to be prompted for every file in a
<CODE>mget</CODE> or <CODE>mput</CODE> operation.  You'll often need to get a
whole set of files and not have each of them confirmed--you know
they're all right.  In that case, use the <CODE>prompt</CODE> command to
turn the queries off.
<P>
<PRE>
ftp&#62; prompt

<P>
Likewise, to turn it back on, the <KBD>prompt</KBD> command should simply
be issued again.

<A NAME="IDX45"></A>
<P>
A group of people at McGill University in Canada got together and created a
query system called <DFN>archie</DFN>.  It was originally formed to be a
quick and easy way to scan the offerings of the many anonymous FTP
sites that are maintained around the world.  As time progressed,
archie grew to include other valuable services as well.
<P>
The archie service is accessible through an interactive telnet
session, email queries, and command-line and X-window clients.  The
email responses can be used along with FTPmail servers for those not
on the Internet.  (See section <A HREF="zen-1.0_13.html#SEC107">FTP-by-Mail Servers</A>, for info on using
FTPmail servers.)
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC26" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC26">Using <VAR>archie</VAR> Today</A></H3>
<P>
Currently, archie tracks the contents of over 800 anonymous FTP
archive sites containing over a million files stored across the
Internet.  Collectively, these files represent well over 50 gigabytes
of information, with new entries being added daily.
<P>
The archie server automatically updates the listing information from
each site about once a month.  This avoids constantly updating the
databases, which could waste network resources, yet ensures that the
information on each site's holdings is reasonably up to date.

<P>
The first thing to understand about Usenet is that it is widely
misunderstood.  Every day on Usenet the "blind men and the
elephant" phenomenon appears, in spades.  In the opinion of the
author, more <DFN>flame wars</DFN> (rabid arguments) arise because of a
lack of understanding of the nature of Usenet than from any other
source.  And consider that such flame wars arise, of necessity, among
people who are on Usenet.  Imagine, then, how poorly understood Usenet
must be by those outside!
<P>
No essay on the nature of Usenet can ignore the erroneous impressions
held by many Usenet users.  Therefore, this section will treat
falsehoods first.  Keep reading for truth.  (Beauty, alas, is not
relevant to Usenet.)
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC31" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC31">What Usenet Is</A></H2>
<P>
Usenet is the set of machines that exchange articles tagged with one
or more universally-recognized labels, called <DFN>newsgroups</DFN> (or
"groups" for short).  (Note that the term <SAMP>`newsgroup'</SAMP> is
correct, while <SAMP>`area'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`base'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`board'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`bboard'</SAMP>,
<SAMP>`conference'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`round table'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`SIG'</SAMP>, etc.  are
incorrect.  If you want to be understood, be accurate.)
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC32" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC32">The Diversity of Usenet</A></H2>
<P>
If the above definition of Usenet sounds vague, that's because it is.
It is almost impossible to generalize over all Usenet sites in any
non-trivial way.  Usenet encompasses government agencies, large
universities, high schools, businesses of all sizes, home computers of
all descriptions, etc.
<P>
Every administrator controls his own site.  No one has any real
control over any site but his own.  The administrator gets his power
from the owner of the system he administers.  As long as the owner is
happy with the job the administrator is doing, he can do whatever he
pleases, up to and including cutting off Usenet entirely.  <VAR>C'est
la vie.</VAR>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC33" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC33">What Usenet Is Not</A></H2>
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><EM>Usenet is not an organization.</EM>
<DD>Usenet has no central authority.  In fact, it has no central anything.
There is a vague notion of "upstream" and "downstream" related to
the direction of high-volume news flow.  It follows that, to the
extent that "upstream" sites decide what traffic they will carry for
their "downstream" neighbors, that "upstream" sites have some
influence on their neighbors.  But such influence is usually easy to
circumvent, and heavy-handed manipulation typically results in a
backlash of resentment.
<P>
<DT><EM>Usenet is not a democracy.</EM>
<DD>A democracy can be loosely defined as "government of the people, by
the people, for the people."  However, as explained above, Usenet is
not an organization, and only an organization can be run as a
democracy.  Even a democracy must be organized, for if it lacks a
means of enforcing the peoples' wishes, then it may as well not exist.
<P>
Some people wish that Usenet were a democracy.  Many people pretend
that it is.  Both groups are sadly deluded.
<P>
<DT><EM>Usenet is not fair.</EM>
<DD>After all, who shall decide what's fair?  For that matter, if someone
is behaving unfairly, who's going to stop him?  Neither you nor I,
that's certain.
<P>
<DT><EM>Usenet is not a right.</EM>
<DD>Some people misunderstand their local right of "freedom of speech"
to mean that they have a legal right to use others' computers to say
what they wish in whatever way they wish, and the owners of said
computers have no right to stop them.
<P>
Those people are wrong.  Freedom of speech also means freedom not to
speak; if I choose not to use my computer to aid your speech, that is
my right.  Freedom of the press belongs to those who own one.
<P>
<DT><EM>Usenet is not a public utility.</EM>
<DD>Some Usenet sites are publicly funded or subsidized.  Most of them,
by plain count, are not.  There is no government monopoly on Usenet,
and little or no control.
<P>
<DT><EM>Usenet is not a commercial network.</EM>
<DD>Many Usenet sites are academic or government organizations; in fact,
Usenet originated in academia.  Therefore, there is a Usenet custom of
keeping commercial traffic to a minimum.  If such commercial traffic
is generally considered worth carrying, then it may be grudgingly
tolerated.  Even so, it is usually separated somehow from
non-commercial traffic; see <CODE>comp.newprod</CODE>.
<P>
<DT><EM>Usenet is not the Internet.</EM>
<DD>The Internet is a wide-ranging network, parts of which are subsidized
by various governments.  The Internet carries many kinds of traffic;
Usenet is only one of them.  And the Internet is only one of the
various networks carrying Usenet traffic.
<P>
<DT><EM>Usenet is not a Unix network, nor even an ASCII network.</EM>
<DD><P>
Don't assume that everyone is using "rn" on a Unix machine.  There
are Vaxen running VMS, IBM mainframes, Amigas, and MS-DOS PCs reading
and posting to Usenet.  And, yes, some of them use (shudder) EBCDIC.
Ignore them if you like, but they're out there.
<P>
<DT><EM>Usenet is not software.</EM>
<DD>There are dozens of software packages used at various sites to
transport and read Usenet articles.  So no one program or package can
be called "the Usenet software."
<P>
Software designed to support Usenet traffic can be (and is) used for
other kinds of communication, usually without risk of mixing the two.
Such private communication networks are typically kept distinct from
Usenet by the invention of newsgroup names different from the
universally-recognized ones.
<P>
<DT><EM>Usenet is not a UUCP network.</EM>
<DD><P>
UUCP is a protocol (some might say <DFN>protocol suite</DFN>, but that's a
technical point) for sending data over point-to-point connections,
typically using dialup modems.  Usenet is only one of the various
kinds of traffic carried via UUCP, and UUCP is only one of the various
transports carrying Usenet traffic.
</DL>
<P>
Well, enough negativity.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC34" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC34">Propagation of News</A></H2>
<P>
In the old days, when UUCP over long-distance dialup lines was the
dominant means of article transmission, a few well-connected sites had
real influence in determining which newsgroups would be carried where.
Those sites called themselves "the backbone."
<P>
But things have changed.  Nowadays, even the smallest Internet site
has connectivity the likes of which the backbone admin of yesteryear
could only dream.  In addition, in the U.S., the advent of cheaper
long-distance calls and high-speed modems has made long-distance
Usenet feeds thinkable for smaller companies.  There is only one
pre-eminent UUCP transport site today in the U.S., namely
<A NAME="IDX49">UUNET</A>
.  But
UUNET isn't a player in the propagation wars, because it never refuses
any traffic--it gets paid by the minute, after all; to refuse based
on content would jeopardize its legal status as an enhanced service
provider.
<P>
All of the above applies to the U.S.  In Europe, different cost
structures favored the creation of strictly controlled hierarchical
organizations with central registries.  This is all very unlike the
traditional mode of U.S. sites (pick a name, get the software, get a
feed, you're on).  Europe's "benign monopolies", long uncontested,
now face competition from looser organizations patterned after the
U.S. model.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC35" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC35">Group Creation</A></H2>
<P>
As discussed above, Usenet is not a democracy.  Nevertheless,
currently the most popular way to create a new newsgroup involves a
"vote" to determine popular support for (and opposition to) a
proposed newsgroup. See section <A HREF="zen-1.0_14.html#SEC108">Newsgroup Creation</A>, for detailed
instructions and guidelines on the process involved in making a
newsgroup.
<P>
If you follow the guidelines, it is probable that your group will be
created and will be widely propagated.  However, due to the nature of
Usenet, there is no way for any user to enforce the results of a
newsgroup vote (or any other decision, for that matter).  Therefore,
for your new newsgroup to be propagated widely, you must not only
follow the letter of the guidelines; you must also follow its spirit.
And you must not allow even a whiff of shady dealings or dirty tricks
to mar the vote.
<P>
So, you may ask: How is a new user supposed to know anything about the
"spirit" of the guidelines?  Obviously, she can't.  This fact leads
inexorably to the following recommendation:
<P>
<PRE>
<EM>If you're a new user, don't try to create a new newsgroup alone.</EM>
</PRE>
<P>
If you have a good newsgroup idea, then read the <CODE>news.groups</CODE>
newsgroup for a while (six months, at least) to find out how things
work.  If you're too impatient to wait six months, then you really
need to learn; read <CODE>news.groups</CODE> for a year instead.  If you just
can't wait, find a Usenet old hand to run the vote for you.
<P>
Readers may think this advice unnecessarily strict.  Ignore it at your
peril.  It is embarrassing to speak before learning.  It is foolish to
jump into a society you don't understand with your mouth open.  And it
is futile to try to force your will on people who can tune you out
with the press of a key.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC36" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC36">If You're Unhappy...</A></H2>
Property rights being what they are, there is no higher authority on
Usenet than the people who own the machines on which Usenet traffic is
carried.  If the owner of the machine you use says, "We will not
carry <CODE>alt.sex</CODE> on this machine," and you are not happy with
that order, you have no Usenet recourse.  What can we outsiders do,
after all?
<P>
That doesn't mean you are without options.  Depending on the nature of
your site, you may have some internal political recourse.  Or you
might find external pressure helpful.  Or, with a minimal investment,
you can get a feed of your own from somewhere else. Computers capable
of taking Usenet feeds are down in the $500 range now,
Unix-capable boxes are going for under $2000, and there are at least
two Unix lookalikes in the $100 price range.
<P>
No matter what, appealing to "Usenet" won't help.  Even if those who
read such an appeal regarding system administration are sympathetic to
your cause, they will almost certainly have even less influence at
your site than you do.
<P>
By the same token, if you don't like what some user at another site is
doing, only the administrator and/or owner of that site have any
authority to do anything about it.  Persuade them that the user in
question is a problem for them, and they might do something (if they
feel like it).  If the user in question is the administrator or owner
of the site from which he or she posts, forget it; you can't win.
Arrange for your newsreading software to ignore articles from him or
her if you can, and chalk one up to experience.

<H2><A NAME="SEC37" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC37">The History of Usenet (The ABCs)</A></H2>
<P>
In the beginning, there were conversations, and they were good.  Then
came Usenet in 1979, shortly after the release of V7 Unix with UUCP;
and it was better.  Two Duke University grad students in North
Carolina, Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis, thought of hooking computers
together to exchange information with the Unix community.  Steve
Bellovin, a grad student at the University of North Carolina, put
together the first version of the news software using shell scripts
and installed it on the first two sites: <VAR>unc</VAR> and <VAR>duke</VAR>. At
the beginning of 1980 the network consisted of those two sites and
<VAR>phs</VAR> (another machine at Duke), and was described at the January
1980 Usenix conference in Boulder, CO.<A NAME="FOOT7" HREF="zen-1.0_foot.html#FOOT7">(7)</A> Steve Bellovin later
rewrote the scripts into C programs, but they were never released
beyond <VAR>unc</VAR> and <VAR>duke</VAR>.  Shortly thereafter, Steve Daniel did
another implementation in the C programming language for public
distribution.  Tom Truscott made further modifications, and this
became the "A" news release.
<P>
In 1981 at the University of California at Berkeley, grad student Mark
Horton and high school student Matt Glickman rewrote the news software
to add functionality and to cope with the ever increasing volume of
news---"A" news was intended for only a few articles per group per
day.  This rewrite was the "B" news version.  The first public
release was version 2.1 in 1982; all versions before 2.1 were
considered in beta test.  As The Net grew, the news software was
expanded and modified.  The last version maintained and released
primarily by Mark was 2.10.1.
<P>
Rick Adams, then at the Center for Seismic Studies, took over
coordination of the maintenance and enhancement of the news software
with the 2.10.2 release in 1984.  By this time, the increasing volume
of news was becoming a concern, and the mechanism for moderated groups
was added to the software at 2.10.2.  Moderated groups were inspired
by ARPA mailing lists and experience with other bulletin board
systems.  In late 1986, version 2.11 of news was released, including a
number of changes to support a new naming structure for newsgroups,
enhanced batching and compression, enhanced ihave/sendme control
messages, and other features.  The current release of news is 2.11,
patchlevel 19.
<A NAME="IDX50"></A>
<P>
A new version of news, becoming known as "C" news, has been
developed at the University of Toronto by Geoff Collyer and Henry
Spencer.  This version is a rewrite of the lowest levels of news to
increase article processing speed, decrease article expiration
processing and improve the reliability of the news system through
better locking, etc.  The package was released to The Net in the
autumn of 1987.  For more information, see the paper <CITE>News Need Not Be
Slow</CITE>, published in the Winter 1987 Usenix Technical Conference
proceedings.
<P>
Usenet software has also been ported to a number of platforms, from the
Amiga and IBM PCs all the way to minicomputers and mainframes.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC38" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC38">Hierarchies</A></H2>
Newsgroups are organized according to their specific areas of
concentration.  Since the groups are in a <DFN>tree</DFN> structure, the
various areas are called hierarchies.  There are seven major categories:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><SAMP>`comp'</SAMP>
<DD>Topics of interest to both computer professionals and
hobbyists, including topics in computer science, software sources, and
information on hardware and software systems.
<P>
<DT><SAMP>`misc'</SAMP>
<DD>Group addressing themes not easily classified into any of the other
headings or which incorporate themes from multiple categories.
Subjects include fitness, job-hunting, law, and investments. 
<P>
<DT><SAMP>`sci'</SAMP>
<DD>Discussions marked by special knowledge relating to research in or
application of the established sciences.
<P>
<DT><SAMP>`soc'</SAMP>
<DD>Groups primarily addressing social issues and socializing.  Included
are discussions related to many different world cultures.
<P>
<DT><SAMP>`talk'</SAMP>
<DD>Groups largely debate-oriented and tending to feature long
discussions without resolution and without appreciable amounts of
generally useful information.
<P>
<DT><SAMP>`news'</SAMP>
<DD>Groups concerned with the news network, group maintenance, and software.
<P>
<DT><SAMP>`rec'</SAMP>
<DD>Groups oriented towards hobbies and recreational activities
</DL>
<P>
These "world" newsgroups are (usually) circulated around the entire
Usenet--this implies world-wide distribution.  Not all groups
actually enjoy such wide distribution, however.  The European Usenet
and Eunet sites take only a selected subset of the more "technical"
groups, and controversial "noise" groups are often not carried by many
sites in the U.S. and Canada (these groups are primarily under the <SAMP>`talk'</SAMP>
and <SAMP>`soc'</SAMP> classifications).  Many sites do not carry some or all of
the <CODE>comp.binaries</CODE> groups because of the typically large size of
the posts in them (being actual executable programs).
<P>
Also available are a number of "alternative" hierarchies:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><SAMP>`alt'</SAMP>
<DD>True anarchy; anything and everything can and does appear;
subjects include sex, the Simpsons, and privacy.
<P>
<DT><SAMP>`gnu'</SAMP>
<DD>Groups concentrating on interests and software with the GNU
Project of the Free Software Foundation. For further info on what the
FSF is, see section <A HREF="zen-1.0_9.html#SEC96">The Free Software Foundation</A>.
<P>
<DT><SAMP>`biz'</SAMP>
<DD>Business-related groups.
</DL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC39" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC39">Moderated vs Unmoderated</A></H2>
<A NAME="IDX51"></A>
<A NAME="IDX52"></A>
<P>
Some newsgroups insist that the discussion remain focused and
on-target; to serve this need, moderated groups came to be.  All
articles posted to a moderated group get mailed to the group's
<DFN>moderator</DFN>.  He or she periodically (hopefully sooner than later)
reviews the posts, and then either posts them individually to Usenet,
or posts a composite <DFN>digest</DFN> of the articles for the past day or
two.  This is how many mailing list gateways work (for example, the
<CITE>Risks Digest</CITE>).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC40" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC40"><CODE>news.groups</CODE> &#38; <CODE>news.announce.newgroups</CODE></A></H2>
<P>
Being a good <DFN>net.citizen</DFN> includes being involved in the
continuing growth and evolution of the Usenet system.  One part of
this involvement includes following the discussion in the groups
<CODE>news.groups</CODE> and the notes in <CODE>news.announce.newgroups</CODE>.
It is there that discussion goes on about the creation of new groups
and destruction of inactive ones.  Every person on Usenet is allowed
and encouraged to vote on the creation of a newsgroup.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC41" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC41">How Usenet Works</A></H2>
<UL>
</UL>
<P>
The transmission of Usenet news is entirely cooperative.  Feeds are
generally provided out of good will and the desire to distribute news
everywhere.  There are places which provide feeds for a fee (e.g.
UUNET), but for the large part no exchange of money is involved.
<P>
There are two major transport methods, UUCP and NNTP.  The first is
mainly modem-based and involves the normal charges for telephone
calls.  The second, NNTP, is the primary method for distributing news
over the Internet.
<A NAME="IDX53"></A>
<A NAME="IDX54"></A>
<P>
With UUCP, news is stored in <DFN>batches</DFN> on a site until the
neighbor calls to receive the articles, or the feed site happens to
call.  A list of groups which the neighbor wishes to receive is
maintained on the feed site.  The Cnews system compresses its batches,
which can dramatically reduce the transmission time necessary for a
relatively heavy newsfeed.
<P>
NNTP, on the other hand, offers a little more latitude with how news
is sent.  The traditional store-and-forward method is, of course,
available.  Given the "real-time" nature of the Internet, though,
other methods have been devised.  Programs now keep constant
connections with their news neighbors, sending news nearly
instantaneously, and can handle dozens of simultaneous feeds, both
incoming and outgoing.
<P>
The transmission of a Usenet article is centered around the unique
<SAMP>`Message-ID:'</SAMP> header.  When an NNTP site offers an article to a
neighbor, it says it has that specific Message ID.  If the neighbor
finds it hasn't received the article yet, it tells the feed to send it
through; this is repeated for each and every article that's waiting
for the neighbor.  Using unique IDs helps prevent a system from
receiving five copies of an article from each of its five news
neighbors, for example.
<P>
Further information on how Usenet works with relation to the various
transports is available in the documentation for the Cnews and NNTP
packages, as well as in RFC-1036, the <CITE>Standard for Interchange of
USENET Messages</CITE> and RFC-977, <CITE>Network News Transfer Protocol: A
Proposed Standard for the Stream-Based Transmission of News</CITE>.  The
RFCs do tend to be rather dry reading, particularly to the new user.
See section <A HREF="zen-1.0_10.html#SEC102">Requests for Comments</A> for information on retrieving RFCs.

<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC42" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC42">Mail Gateways</A></H2>
<A NAME="IDX56"></A>
<P>
A natural progression is for Usenet news and electronic mailing lists
to somehow become merged--which they have, in the form of <DFN>news
gateways</DFN>.  Many mailing lists are set up to "reflect" messages not
only to the readership of the list, but also into a newsgroup.
Likewise, posts to a newsgroup can be sent to the moderator of the
mailing list, or to the entire mailing list.  Some examples of this in
action are <CODE>comp.risks</CODE> (the <CITE>Risks Digest</CITE>) and
<CODE>comp.dcom.telecom</CODE> (the <CITE>Telecom Digest</CITE>).
<P>
This method of propagating mailing list traffic has helped solve the
problem of a single message being delivered to a number of people at
the same site--instead, anyone can just subscribe to the group.
Also, mailing list maintenance is lowered substantially, since the
moderators don't have to be constantly removing and adding users to
and from the list.  Instead, the people can read and not read the
newsgroup at their leisure.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC43" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC43">Usenet "Netiquette"</A></H2>
<UL>
</UL>
<P>
There are many traditions with Usenet, not the least of which is
dubbed <DFN>netiquette</DFN>---being polite and considerate of others.  If
you follow a few basic guidelines, you, and everyone that reads your
posts, will be much happier in the long run.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC44" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC44">Signatures</A></H3>
<P>
At the end of most articles is a small blurb called a person's
<DFN><A NAME="IDX57">signature</A></DFN>.
In Unix this file is named <TT>`.signature'</TT> in the
person's login directory--it will vary for other operating systems.
It exists to provide information about how to get in touch with the
person posting the article, including their
<A NAME="IDX58">email address</A>
, phone
number, address, or where they're located.  Even so, signatures have
become the graffiti of computers.  People put song lyrics, pictures,
philosophical quotes, even advertisements in their "<CODE>.sigs</CODE>".
(Note, however, that advertising in your signature will more often
than not get you <DFN>flamed</DFN> until you take it out.)
<P>
Four lines will suffice--more is just extra garbage for Usenet sites
to carry along with your article, which is supposed to be the intended
focus of the reader.  Netiquette dictates limiting oneself to this
"quota" of four--some people make signatures that are ten lines or
even more, including elaborate ASCII drawings of their hand-written
signature or faces or even the space shuttle.  This is <EM>not</EM>
cute, and will bother people to no end.
<P>
Similarly, it's not necessary to include your signature--if you
forget to append it to an article, <EM>don't worry</EM> about it.  The
article's just as good as it ever would be, and contains everything
you should want to say.  Don't re-post the article just to include the
signature.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC45" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC45">Posting Personal Messages</A></H3>
<P>
If mail to a person doesn't make it through, avoid posting the message
to a newsgroup.  Even if the likelihood of that person reading the
group is very high, all of the other people reading the articles don't
give a whit what you have to say to Jim Morrison.  Simply wait for the
person to post again and double-check the address, or get in touch
with your system administrator and see if it's a problem with local
email delivery.  It may also turn out that their site is down or is
having problems, in which case it's just necessary to wait until
things return to normal before contacting Jim.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC46" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC46">Posting Mail</A></H3>
<P>
In the interests of privacy, it's considered extremely bad taste to post
any email that someone may have sent, unless they explicitly give you
permission to redistribute it.  While the legal issues can be heavily
debated, most everyone agrees that email should be treated as anything
one would receive via normal snailmail,<A NAME="FOOT8" HREF="zen-1.0_foot.html#FOOT8">(8)</A>, with all of the assumed rights
that are carried with it.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC47" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC47">Test Messages</A></H3>
<P>
Many people, particularly new users, want to try out posting before
actually taking part in discussions.  Often the mechanics of getting
messages out is the most difficult part of Usenet.  To this end, many,
many users find it necessary to post their tests to "normal" groups
(for example, <CODE>news.admin</CODE> or <CODE>comp.mail.misc</CODE>).  This is
considered a major netiquette <DFN>faux pas</DFN> in the Usenet world.
There are a number of groups available, called
<A NAME="IDX59"><DFN>test groups</DFN></A>
, that
exist solely for the purpose of trying out a news system, reader, or
even new signature.  They include
<P>
<PRE>
alt.test
gnu.gnusenet.test
misc.test
</PRE>
<P>
some of which will generate <DFN>auto-magic</DFN> replies to your posts to
let you know they made it through.  There are certain denizens of
Usenet that frequent the test groups to help new users out.  They
respond to the posts, often including the article so the poster can
see how it got to the person's site.  Also, many regional hierarchies
have test groups, like <CODE>phl.test</CODE> in Philadelphia.
<P>
By all means, experiment and test--just do it in its proper place.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC48" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC48">Famous People Appearing</A></H3>
<P>
Every once in a while, someone says that a celebrity is accessible
through "The Net"; or, even more entertaining, an article is forged
to appear to be coming from that celebrity.  One example is Stephen
Spielberg--the <CODE>rec.arts.movies</CODE> readership was in an uproar for
two weeks following a couple of posts supposedly made by Mr.
Spielberg.  (Some detective work revealed it to be a hoax.)
<P>
There <EM>are</EM> a few well-known people that are acquainted with
Usenet and computers in general--but the overwhelming majority are
just normal people.  One should act with skepticism whenever a notable
personality is "seen" in a newsgroup.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC49" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC49">Summaries</A></H3>
<P>
Authors of articles occasionally say that readers should reply by mail
and they'll <DFN>summarize</DFN>.  Accordingly, readers should do just
that--reply via mail.  Responding with a followup article to such an
article defeats the intention of the author.  She, in a few days, will
post one article containing the highlights of the responses she
received.  By following up to the whole group, the author may not read
what you have to say.
<P>
When creating a summary of the replies to a post, try to make it as
<DFN>reader-friendly</DFN> as possible.  Avoid just putting all of the
messages received into one big file.  Rather, take some time and edit
the messages into a form that contains the essential information that
other readers would be interested in.
<P>
Also, sometimes people will respond but request to remain anonymous
(one example is the employees of a corporation that feel the
information's not proprietary, but at the same time want to protect
themselves from political backlash).  Summaries should honor this
request accordingly by listing the <SAMP>`From:'</SAMP> address as
<SAMP>`anonymous'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`(Address withheld by request)'</SAMP>.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC50" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC50">Quoting</A></H3>
<P>
When following up to an article, many newsreaders provide the facility
to <DFN>quote</DFN> the original article with each line prefixed by <SAMP>`&#62;
'</SAMP>, as in
<P>
<PRE>
In article &#60;1232@foo.bar.com&#62;, sharon@foo.bar.com wrote:
&#62; I agree, I think that basketweaving's really catching on,
&#62; particularly in Pennsylvania.  Here's a list of every person
&#62; in PA that currently engages in it publicly:
... etc ...
</PRE>
<P>
This is a severe example (potentially a horribly long article), but
proves a point.  When you quote another person, <EM>edit out</EM>
whatever isn't directly applicable to your reply.<A NAME="FOOT9" HREF="zen-1.0_foot.html#FOOT9">(9)</A>  This gives the reader of the new
article a better idea of what points you were addressing.  By
including the <EM>entire</EM> article, you'll only annoy those reading
it.  Also, signatures in the original aren't necessary; the readers
already know who wrote it (by the attribution).
<P>
Avoid being tedious with responses--rather than pick apart an
article, address it in parts or as a whole.  Addressing practically
each and every word in an article only proves that the person
responding has absolutely nothing better to do with his time.
<P>
If a "war" starts (insults and personal comments get thrown back and
forth), <DFN>take it into email</DFN>---exchange email with the person
you're arguing with.  No one enjoys watching people bicker
incessantly.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="IDX60"><A NAME="SEC51" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC51">Crossposting</A></A></H3>
<P>
The <SAMP>`Newsgroups:'</SAMP> line isn't limited to just one group--an
article can be posted in a list of groups.  For instance, the line
<P>
<PRE>
	Newsgroups: sci.space,comp.simulation
</PRE>
<P>
posts the article to both the groups <CODE>sci.space</CODE> and
<CODE>comp.simulation.</CODE> It's usually safe to crosspost to up to three
or four groups.  To list more than that is considered "excessive
noise."
<P>
It's also suggested that if an article is crossposted a
<SAMP>`Followup-To:'</SAMP> header be included.  It should name the group to
which all additional discussion should be directed to.  For the above
example a possible <SAMP>`Followup-To:'</SAMP> would be
<P>
<PRE>
	Followup-To: sci.space
</PRE>
<P>
which would make all followups automatically be posted to just
<CODE>sci.space</CODE>, rather than both <CODE>sci.space</CODE> and
<CODE>comp.simulation</CODE>.  If every response made with a newsreader's
"followup" command should go to the person posting the article no
matter what, there's also a mechanism worked in to accommodate.  The
<CODE>Followup-To:</CODE> header should contain the single word
<SAMP>`poster'</SAMP>:
<P>
<PRE>
	Followup-To: poster
</PRE>
<P>
Certain newsreaders will use this to sense that a reply should never
be posted back onto The Net.  This is often used with questions that
will yield a summary of information later, a vote, or an
advertisement.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC52" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC52">Recent News</A></H3>
<P>
One should avoid posting "recent" events--sports scores, a plane
crash, or whatever people will see on the evening news or read in the
morning paper.  By the time the article has propagated across all
of Usenet, the "news" value of the article will have become
stale.  (This is one case for the argument that <SAMP>`Usenet news'</SAMP> is
a misnomer.<A NAME="FOOT10" HREF="zen-1.0_foot.html#FOOT10">(10)</A>)
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC53" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC53">Quality of Postings</A></H3>
<P>
How you write and present yourself in your articles is important.  If
you have terrible spelling, keep a dictionary near by.  If you have
trouble with grammar and punctuation, try to get a book on English
grammar and composition (found in many bookstores and at garage
sales).  By all means pay attention to what you say--it makes you who
you are on The Net.
<P>
Likewise, try to be clear in what you ask.  Ambiguous or vague
questions often lead to no response at all, leaving the poster
discouraged.  Give as much essential information as you feel is
necessary to let people help you, but keep it within limits.  For
instance, you should probably include the operating system of your
computer in the post if it's needed, but don't tell everybody what
peripherals you have hanging off of it.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC54" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC54">Useful Subjects</A></H3>
<P>
The <SAMP>`Subject:'</SAMP> line of an article is what will first attract
people to read it--if it's vague or doesn't describe what's contained
within, no one will read the article.  At the same time,
<SAMP>`Subject:'</SAMP> lines that're too wordy tend to be irritating.  For
example:

Simply put, try to think of what will best help the reader when he or
she encounters your article in a newsreading session.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC55" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC55">Tone of Voice</A></H3>
<P>
Since common computers can't portray the inflection or tone in a
person's voice, how articles are worded can directly affect the
response to them.  If you say
<P>
<PRE>
	Anybody using a Vic-20 should go buy themselves a life.
</PRE>
<P>
you'll definitely get some responses--telling you to take a leap.  Rather
than be inflammatory, phrase your articles in a way that rationally
expresses your opinion, like
<P>
<PRE>
	What're the practical uses of a Vic-20 these days?
</PRE>
<P>
which presents yourself as a much more level-headed individual.
<P>
Also, what case (upper or lower) you use can indicate how you're
trying to speak--netiquette dictates that if you USE ALL CAPITAL
LETTERS, people will think you're "shouting."  Write as you would in
a normal letter to a friend, following traditional rules of English
(or whatever language you happen to speak).

<H3><A NAME="SEC56" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC56">Computer Religion</A></H3>

No matter what kind of computer a person is using, theirs is always
the <EM>best</EM> and most efficient of them all.  Posting articles
asking questions like <SAMP>`What computer should I buy? An Atari ST or an
Amiga?'</SAMP> will lead only to fervent arguments over the merits and
drawbacks of each brand.  Don't even ask The Net--go to a local user
group, or do some research of your own like reading some magazine
reviews.  Trying to say one computer is somehow better than another is
a moot point.

A number of groups include <DFN>Frequently Asked Question</DFN> (FAQ)
lists, which give the answers to questions or points that have been
raised time and time again in a newsgroup.  They're intended to help
cut down on the redundant traffic in a group.  For example, in the

<SAMP>`Did you notice that there's a different blackboard opening at the

Usually, FAQ lists are posted at the beginning of each month, and are

<TITLE>Zen and the Art of the Internet - Telnet</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="zen-1.0_5.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="zen-1.0_7.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H1><A NAME="SEC59" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC59">Telnet</A></H1>
<P>
<DFN>Telnet</DFN> is the main Internet protocol for creating a connection
with a remote machine.  It gives the user the opportunity to be on one
computer system and do work on another, which may be across the street
or thousands of miles away.  Where modems are limited, in the majority,
by the quality of telephone lines and a single connection, telnet
provides a connection that's error-free and nearly always faster than
the latest conventional modems.
<P>
<UL>
</UL>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC60" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC60">Using Telnet</A></H2>
<P>
As with FTP (see section <A HREF="zen-1.0_4.html#SEC16">Anonymous FTP</A>), the actual command for negotiating a telnet
connection varies from system to system.  The most common is
<CODE>telnet</CODE> itself, though.  It takes the form of:
<PRE>
<KBD>telnet <VAR>somewhere.domain</VAR></KBD>
</PRE>
<P>
To be safe, we'll use your local system as a working example.  By now,
you hopefully know your site's domain name.  If not, <EM>ask</EM> or try
to figure it out.  You'll not get by without it.
<P>
To open the connection, type
<PRE>
<KBD>telnet <VAR>your.system.name</VAR></KBD>
</PRE>
<P>
If the system were <CODE>wubba.cs.widener.edu</CODE>, for example, the
command would look like
<P>
<PRE>
<KBD>telnet wubba.cs.widener.edu</KBD>
</PRE>
<P>
The system will respond with something similar to
<P>
<PRE>
Trying 147.31.254.999...
Connected to wubba.cs.widener.edu.
Escape character is '^]'.
</PRE>
<P>
The <DFN>escape character</DFN>, in this example <KBD>^]</KBD> (Control-]), is
the character that will let you go back to the local system to close
the connection, suspend it, etc.  To close this connection, the user
would type <KBD>^]</KBD>, and respond to the <CODE>telnet&#62;</CODE> prompt with the
command <KBD>close</KBD>.  Local documentation should be checked for
information on specific commands, functions, and escape character that
can be used.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC61" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC61">Telnet Ports</A></H3>
<P>
Many telnet clients also include a third option, the <DFN>port</DFN> on
which the connection should take place.  Normally, port 23 is the
default telnet port; the user never has to think about it.  But
sometimes it's desirable to telnet to a different port on a system,
where there may be a service available, or to aid in debugging a
problem.  Using
<P>
<PRE>
telnet <VAR>somewhere.domain</VAR> <VAR>port</VAR>
</PRE>
<P>
will connect the user to the given <VAR>port</VAR> on the system
<VAR>somewhere.domain</VAR>.  Many libraries use this port method to offer
their facilities to the general Internet community; other services are
also available.  For instance, one would type
<P>
<PRE>
telnet martini.eecs.umich.edu 3000
</PRE>
<P>
to connect to the geographic server at the University of Michigan
(see section <A HREF="zen-1.0_6.html#SEC73">Geographic Name Server</A>).  Other such port connections follow the
same usage.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC62" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC62">Publicly Accessible Libraries</A></H2>
<A NAME="IDX63"></A>
<P>
Over the last several years, most university libraries have switched
from a manual (card) catalog system to computerized library catalogs.
The automated systems provide users with easily accessible and
up-to-date information about the books available in these libraries.
This has been further improved upon with the advent of local area
networks, dialup modems, and wide area networks.  Now many of us can
check on our local library's holdings or that of a library halfway
around the world!
<P>
Many, many institutions of higher learning have made their library
catalogs available for searching by anyone on the Internet.  They
include Boston University, the Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries
(CARL), and London University King's College.
<A NAME="IDX64"></A>
<P>
To include a listing of some of the existing sites would not only be
far too long for this document, it would soon be out of date.
Instead, several lists are being maintained and are available either
by mail or via FTP.  Also, the Internet Resource Guide (IRG) also
describes a few libraries that are accessible---see section <A HREF="zen-1.0_10.html#SEC101">Internet Resource Guide</A> for
further information.
<P>
Art St. George and  Ron Larsen are maintaining a list of
Internet-accessible libraries and databases often referred to as "the
St. George directory."  It began with only library catalogs but has
expanded to include sections on campus-wide information systems, and
even bulletin board systems that are not on the Internet.  The library
catalog sections are divided into those that are free, those that
charge, and international (i.e. non-U.S.) catalogs; they are arranged
by state, province, or country within each section.  There is also a
section giving dialup information for some of the library catalogs.
It's available for FTP (see section <A HREF="zen-1.0_4.html#SEC16">Anonymous FTP</A>) on <CODE>nic.cerf.net</CODE>
in the directory <TT>`cerfnet/cerfnet_info/library_catalog'</TT>.  The
file <TT>`internet-catalogs'</TT> has a date suffix; check for the most
current date.  The information is updated periodically.
<A NAME="IDX65"></A>
<P>
Billy Barron, Systems Manager at the University of North Texas,
produces a directory as an aid to his user community.  It complements
the St. George guide by providing a standard format for all systems
which lists the
<A NAME="IDX66">Internet address</A>
, login instructions, the system
vendor, and logoff information.  The arrangement is alphabetic by
organization name.  It's available for FTP on
<CODE>vaxb.acs.unt.edu</CODE> in the subdirectory <TT>`library'</TT> as the file
<TT>`libraries.txt'</TT>.
<A NAME="IDX67"></A>
<P>
For announcements of new libraries being available and discussion on
related topics, consult the Usenet newsgroup
<CODE>comp.internet.library</CODE> (see section <A HREF="zen-1.0_5.html#SEC30">Usenet News</A> to learn how to read

<P>
<H2><A NAME="IDX68"><A NAME="SEC63" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC63">The Cleveland Freenet</A></A></H2>
<P>
Freenets are open-access, free, community computer systems.  One such
system is the Cleveland Freenet, sponsored by CWRU (Case Western
Reserve University).  Anyone and everyone is welcome to join and take
part in the exciting project--that of a National Telecomputing Public
Network, where everyone benefits.  There's <EM>no</EM> charge for the
registration process and <EM>no</EM> charge to use the system.
<P>
To register, telnet to any one of
<P>

<P>
After you're connected, choose the entry on the menu that signifies
you're a guest user.  Another menu will follow; select <SAMP>`Apply for
an account'</SAMP>, and you'll be well on your way to being a FreeNet member.
<P>
You will need to fill out a form and send it to them through the
Postal Service--your login id and password will be created in a few
days.  At that point you're free to use the system as you wish.  They
provide multi-user chat, email, Usenet news, and a variety of other
things to keep you occupied for hours on end.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC64" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC64">Directories</A></H2>
<P>
There are a few systems that are maintained to provide the Internet
community with access to lists of information--users, organizations,
etc.  They range from fully dedicated computers with access to papers
and research results, to a system to find out about the faculty
members of a university.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="IDX69"><A NAME="SEC65" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC65">Knowbot</A></A></H3>
<P>
Knowbot is a "master directory" that contains email address
information from the NIC WHOIS database (see section <A HREF="zen-1.0_7.html#SEC83">The WHOIS Database</A>), the PSI White
Pages Pilot Project, the NYSERNET X.500 database and MCI Mail.  Most
of these services are email registries themselves, but Knowbot
provides a very comfortable way to access all of them in one place.
Telnet to <CODE>nri.reston.va.us</CODE> on port 185.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="IDX70"><A NAME="SEC66" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC66">White Pages</A></A></H3>
<P>
PSI maintains a directory of information on individuals.  It will list
the person's name, organization, and email address if it is given.
Telnet to <CODE>wp.psi.net</CODE> and log in as <SAMP>`fred'</SAMP>.  The White
Pages Project also includes an interface to use Xwindows remotely.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC67" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC67">Databases</A></H2>
<P>
For information on database services, see section <A HREF="zen-1.0_8.html#SEC87">Commercial Databases</A>.
Not all databases on the Internet require payment for use, though.
There do exist some, largely research-driven databases, which are
publicly accessible.  New ones spring up regularly.
<P>
To find out more about the databases in this section, contact the
people directly responsible for them.  Their areas of concentration
and the software used to implement them are widely disparate, and are
probably beyond the author's expertise.  Also, don't forget to check
with your local library--the reference librarian there can provide
information on conventional resources, and possibly even those
available over the Internet (they are becoming more common).
<P>
<H3><A NAME="IDX71"><A NAME="SEC68" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC68">Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries (CARL)</A></A></H3>

<P>
New and interesting ways to use the Internet are being dreamed up
every day.  As they gain wide-spread use, some methods become
near-standard (or actual written standard) tools for Internet users to
take advantage of.  A few are detailed here; there are undoubtedly
others, and new ideas spring up all the time.  An active user of the
Internet will discover most of the more common ones in time.  Usually,
these services are free.  See section <A HREF="zen-1.0_8.html#SEC85">Commercial Services</A> for applications
that are commercially available over the Internet.
<P>
Usenet is often used to announce a new service or capability on
the Internet.  In particular, the groups <CODE>comp.archives</CODE> and
<CODE>comp.protocols.tcp-ip</CODE> are good places to look.  Information
will drift into other areas as word spreads.  See section <A HREF="zen-1.0_5.html#SEC30">Usenet News</A> for

<P>
On many systems there exists the <SAMP>`finger'</SAMP> command, which yield
information about each user that's currently logged in.  This command
also has extensions for use over the Internet, as well.  Under normal
circumstances, the command is simply <SAMP>`finger'</SAMP> for a summary of
who's logged into the local system, or <SAMP>`finger <VAR>username</VAR>'</SAMP>
for specific information about a user. It's also possible to go one
step further and go onto the network.  The general usage is
<P>
<PRE>
finger @<VAR>hostname</VAR>

<P>
Please realize that some sites are very
<A NAME="IDX82">security</A>
conscious, and need
to restrict the information about their systems and users available to
the outside world.  To that end, they often block <CODE>finger</CODE>
requests from outside sites--so don't be surprised if fingering a
computer or a user returns with <SAMP>`Connection refused'</SAMP>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="IDX83"><A NAME="SEC81" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC81">Ping</A></A></H2>
<P>
The <SAMP>`ping'</SAMP> command allows the user to check if another system is
currently "up" and running.  The general form of the command
is <SAMP>`ping <VAR>system</VAR>'</SAMP>.<A NAME="FOOT11" HREF="zen-1.0_foot.html#FOOT11">(11)</A>
For example,
<P>
<PRE>
ping cs.widener.edu
</PRE>
<P>
will tell you if the main machine in Widener University's Computer
Science lab is currently online (we certainly hope so!).<P>
Many implementations of <SAMP>`ping'</SAMP> also include an option to let you
see how fast a link is running (to give you some idea of the load on
the network).  For example:
<P>
<PRE>
% ping -s cs.swarthmore.edu
PING cs.swarthmore.edu: 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 130.58.68.1: icmp_seq=0 ttl=251 time=66 ms
64 bytes from 130.58.68.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=251 time=45 ms
64 bytes from 130.58.68.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=251 time=46 ms
^C
--- cs.swarthmore.edu ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 45/52/66 ms

<P>
This case tells us that for <SAMP>`cs.swarthmore.edu'</SAMP> it takes about 46
milliseconds for a packet to go from Widener to Swarthmore College and
back again.  It also gives the average and worst-case speeds, and any
packet loss that may have occurred (e.g. because of network
congestion).
<P>
While <SAMP>`ping'</SAMP> generally doesn't hurt network performance, you
shouldn't use it <EM>too</EM> often--usually once or twice will leave
you relatively sure of the other system's state.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="IDX84"><A NAME="SEC82" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC82">Talk</A></A></H2>
<P>
Sometimes email is clumsy and difficult to manage when one really
needs to have an interactive conversation.  The Internet provides for
that as well, in the form of <DFN>talk</DFN>. Two users can literally see
each other type across thousands of miles.
<P>
To talk with Bart Simpson at Widener, one would type
<P>
<PRE>
talk bart@cs.widener.edu
</PRE>
<P>
which would cause a message similar to the following to be displayed
on Bart's terminal:
<P>
<PRE>
Message from Talk_Daemon@cs.widener.edu at 21:45 ...
talk: connection requested by joe@ee.someplace.edu
talk: respond with:  talk joe@ee.someplace.edu
</PRE>
<P>
Bart would, presumably, respond by typing <SAMP>`talk joe@ee.someplace.edu'</SAMP>.
They could then chat about whatever they wished, with instantaneous
response time, rather than the write-and-wait style of email.  To
leave <CODE>talk</CODE>, on many systems one would type <CODE>Ctrl-C</CODE> (hold down
the Control key and press <SAMP>`C'</SAMP>).  Check local documentation to be sure.
<P>
There are two different versions of talk in common use today.  The
first, dubbed "old talk," is supported by a set of Unix systems
(most notably, those currently sold by Sun).  The second, <CODE>ntalk</CODE>
(aka "new talk"), is more of the standard.  If, when attempting to
talk with another user, it responds with an error about protocol
families, odds are the incompatibilities between versions of talk is
the culprit.  It's up to the system administrators of sites which use
the old talk to install <CODE>ntalk</CODE> for their users.

It's primarily used by system postmasters or listowners to find the
<DFN>Points of Contact</DFN> for a site, to let them know of a problem or

<H1><A NAME="SEC89" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC89">Things You'll Hear About</A></H1>
<UL>
</UL>
<P>
There are certain things that you'll hear about shortly after you
start actively using the Internet.  Most people assume that everyone's
familiar with them, and they require no additional explanation.  If
only that were true!
<P>
This section addresses a few topics that are commonly encountered and
asked about as a new user explores Cyberspace.  Some of them are
directly related to how the networks are run today; other points are
simply interesting to read about.
<A NAME="IDX97"></A>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC90" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC90">The Internet Worm</A></H2>
<A NAME="IDX98"></A>
<P>
On November 2, 1988,
<A NAME="IDX99">Robert Morris, Jr.,</A>
a graduate student in
Computer Science at Cornell, wrote an experimental, self-replicating,
self-propagating program called a <DFN>worm</DFN> and injected it into
the Internet.  He chose to release it from MIT, to disguise the fact
that the worm came from Cornell.  Morris soon discovered that the
program was replicating and reinfecting machines at a much faster rate
than he had anticipated--there was a bug.  Ultimately, many machines
at locations around the country either crashed or became
"catatonic."  When Morris realized what was happening, he contacted
a friend at Harvard to discuss a solution.  Eventually, they sent an
anonymous message from Harvard over the network, instructing
programmers how to kill the worm and prevent reinfection.  However,
because the network route was clogged, this message did not get
through until it was too late.  Computers were affected at many sites,
including universities, military sites, and medical research
facilities.  The estimated cost of dealing with the worm at each
installation ranged from $200 to more than $53,000.
<A NAME="FOOT12" HREF="zen-1.0_foot.html#FOOT12">(12)</A>
<P>
The program took advantage of a hole in the debug mode of the Unix
<DFN>sendmail</DFN> program, which runs on a system and waits for other
systems to connect to it and give it email, and a hole in the
<A NAME="IDX100">finger</A>
daemon <DFN>fingerd</DFN>, which serves <CODE>finger</CODE> requests
(see section <A HREF="zen-1.0_7.html#SEC80">Finger</A>).  People at the University of California at Berkeley
and MIT had copies of the program and were actively
<DFN>disassembling</DFN> it (returning the program back into its source
form) to try to figure out how it worked.
<P>
Teams of programmers worked non-stop to come up with at least a
temporary fix, to prevent the continued spread of the worm.  After
about twelve hours, the team at Berkeley came up with steps that would
help retard the spread of the virus.  Another method was also
discovered at Purdue and widely published.  The information didn't get
out as quickly as it could have, however, since so many sites had
completely disconnected themselves from the network.
<P>
After a few days, things slowly began to return to normalcy and
everyone wanted to know <EM>who</EM> had done it all.  Morris was later
named in <CITE>The New York Times</CITE> as the author (though this hadn't yet
been officially proven, there was a substantial body of evidence
pointing to Morris).
<P>
Robert T. Morris was convicted of violating the computer Fraud and
Abuse Act (Title 18), and sentenced to three years of probation, 400
hours of community service, a fine of $10,050, and the costs of his
supervision.  His appeal, filed in December, 1990, was rejected the
following March.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC91" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC91">The Cuckoo's Egg</A></H2>
<P>
First in an article entitled "Stalking the Wily Hacker," and later in
the book <CITE>The Cuckoo's Egg</CITE>,
<A NAME="IDX101">Clifford Stoll</A>
detailed his
experiences trying to track down someone breaking into a system at
Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in California.<A NAME="FOOT13" HREF="zen-1.0_foot.html#FOOT13">(13)</A>
<P>
A 75-cent discrepancy in the Lab's accounting records led Stoll on a
chase through California, Virginia, and Europe to end up in a small
apartment in Hannover, West Germany.  Stoll dealt with many levels of
bureaucracy and red tape, and worked with the FBI, the CIA, and the
German Bundespost trying to track his hacker down.
<P>
The experiences of Stoll, and particularly his message in speaking
engagements, have all pointed out the dire need for communication
between parties on a network of networks.  The only way everyone can
peacefully co-exist in Cyberspace is by ensuring rapid recognition of
any existing problems.

</UL>
<P>
The indomitable need for humans to congregate and share their common
interests is also present in the computing world.  <DFN>User groups</DFN>
exist around the world, where people share ideas and experiences.
Similarly, there are organizations which are one step "above" user
groups; that is to say, they exist to encourage or promote an idea or
set of ideas, rather than support a specific computer or application
of computers.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC93" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC93">The Association for Computing Machinery</A></H3>
<P>
The Association for Computing Machinery (the <A NAME="IDX103">ACM</A>) was founded in
1947, immediately after Eckert and Mauchly unveiled one of the first
electronic computers, the ENIAC, in 1946.  Since then, the
ACM has grown by leaps and bounds, becoming one of the leading
educational and scientific societies in the computer industry.
<P>
The ACM's stated purposes are:
<UL>
<LI>
To advance the sciences and arts of information processing;
<P>
<LI>
To promote the free interchange of information about the sciences and
arts of information processing both among specialists and among the
public;
<P>
<LI>
To develop and maintain the integrity and competence of individuals
engaged in the practices of the sciences and arts of information
processing.
</UL>
<P>
Membership in the ACM has grown from seventy-eight in September, 1947,
to over 77,000 today.  There are local chapters around the world, and
many colleges and universities endorse student chapters.  Lecturers
frequent these meetings, which tend to be one step above the normal
"user group" gathering.  A large variety of published material is
also available at discounted prices for members of the association.
<P>
The ACM has a number of <DFN>Special Interest Groups</DFN> (SIGs) that
concentrate on a certain area of computing, ranging from graphics to
the Ada programming language to security.  Each of the SIGs also
publishes its own newsletter.  There is a Usenet group,
<CODE>comp.org.acm</CODE>, for the discussion of ACM topics.  See section <A HREF="zen-1.0_5.html#SEC30">Usenet News</A> for more information on reading news.

<P>
The <A NAME="IDX104">CPSR</A> is an alliance of computer professionals concentrating on
certain areas of the impact of computer technology on society.  It
traces its history to the fall of 1981, when several researchers in
Palo Alto, California, organized a lunch meeting to discuss their
shared concerns about the connection between computing and the
nuclear arms race.  Out of that meeting and the discussions which
followed, CPSR was born, and has been active ever since.<A NAME="FOOT14" HREF="zen-1.0_foot.html#FOOT14">(14)</A>
<P>
The national CPSR program focuses on the following project areas:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>
<STRONG>Reliability and Risk</STRONG>  This area reflects on the concern that
overreliance on computing technology can lead to unacceptable risks to
society.  It includes, but isn't limited to, work in analyzing
military systems such as SDI.
<P>
<LI>
<STRONG>Civil Liberties and Privacy</STRONG>  This project is concerned with such
topics as the FBI National Crime Information Center, the growing use
of databases by both government and private industry, the right of
access to public information, extension of First Amendment rights to
electronic communication, and establishing legal protections for
privacy of computerized information.
<P>
<LI>
<STRONG>Computers in the Workplace</STRONG>  The CPSR Workplace Project has
concentrated its attention on the design of software for the
workplace, and particularly on the philosophy of "participatory design,"
in which software designers work together with users to ensure that
systems meet the actual needs of that workplace.
<P>
<LI>
<STRONG>The 21st Century Project</STRONG> This is a coalition with other
professional organizations working towards redirecting national
research priorities from concentrating on military issues to
anticipating and dealing with future problems as science and
technology enter the next century.

of the popular GNU Emacs editor). It is dedicated to eliminating
restrictions on copying, redistributing, and modifying software.
<P>
The word "free" in their name does not refer to price; it refers to
freedom.  First, the freedom to copy a program and redistribute it to
your neighbors, so that they can use it as well as you.  Second, the
freedom to change a program, so that you can control it instead of it
controlling you; for this, the source code must be made available to
you.
<P>
The Foundation works to provide these freedoms by developing free
compatible replacements for proprietary software.  Specifically, they
are putting together a complete, integrated software system called
<A NAME="IDX109">"GNU"</A>
that is upward-compatible with Unix.<A NAME="FOOT16" HREF="zen-1.0_foot.html#FOOT16">(16)</A> When it is released, everyone will
be permitted to copy it and distribute it to others.  In addition, it
will be distributed with source code, so you will be able to learn
about operating systems by reading it, to port it to your own machine,
and to exchange the changes with others.
<P>

the GNU Project, or for a list of the current tasks that still need to
be done, write to <CODE>gnu@prep.ai.mit.edu</CODE>.

<H3><A NAME="IDX110"><A NAME="SEC97" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC97">The League for Programming Freedom</A></A></H3>
<P>
The League for Programming Freedom is a grass-roots organization of
professors, students, businessmen, programmers and users dedicated to
"bringing back" the freedom to write programs, which they contend
has been lost over the past number years.  The League is not opposed
to the legal system that Congress intended--copyright on individual
programs. Their aim is to reverse the recent changes made by judges in
response to special interests, often explicitly rejecting the public
interest principles of the Constitution.
<P>
The League works to abolish the new monopolies by publishing articles,
talking with public officials, boycotting egregious offenders, and in
the future may intervene in court cases.  On May 24, 1989, the League
picketed Lotus headquarters because of their lawsuits, and then
again on August 2, 1990.  These marches stimulated widespread media
coverage for the issue.  They welcome suggestions for other
activities, as well as help in carrying them out.

<P>
Research and development are two buzz words often heard when
discussing the networking field--everything needs to go faster, over
longer distances, for a lower cost.  To "keep current," one should
read the various trade magazines and newspapers, or frequent the
networking-oriented newsgroups of Usenet.  If possible, attend trade
shows and symposia like Usenix, Interop, et. al.
<P>
<H3><A NAME="SEC99" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC99">NREN</A></H3>
<P>
The National Research and Education Network (NREN) is a five-year
project approved by Congress in the Fall of 1991.  It's intended to
create a national electronic "super-highway."  The NREN will be 50
times faster than the fastest available networks (at the time of this
writing).  Proponents of the NREN claim it will be possible to
transfer the equivalent of the entire text of the Encyclopedia
Britannica in one second.  Further information, including the original
text of the bill presented by Senator Al Gore (D--TN), is available
through anonymous FTP to <CODE>nis.nsf.net</CODE>, in the directory
<TT>`nsfnet'</TT>.  In addition, Vint Cerf wrote on the then-proposed NREN
in RFC-1167, <CITE>Thoughts on the National Research and Education
Network</CITE>.  See section <A HREF="zen-1.0_10.html#SEC102">Requests for Comments</A> for information on obtaining RFCs.
<P>
A mailing list, <SAMP>`nren-discuss@uu.psi.com'</SAMP>, is available for
discussion of the NREN; write to
<SAMP>`nren-discuss-request@uu.psi.com'</SAMP> to be added.

<TITLE>Zen and the Art of the Internet - Finding Out More</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="zen-1.0_9.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="zen-1.0_11.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H1><A NAME="SEC100" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC100">Finding Out More</A></H1>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC101" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC101">Internet Resource Guide</A></H2>
<P>
The NSF Network Service Center (NNSC) compiles and makes available an
<A NAME="IDX111">Internet Resource Guide (IRG)</A>.
The goal of the guide is to increase the
visibility of various Internet resources that may help users do their
work better.  While not yet an exhaustive list, the guide is a useful
compendium of many resources and can be a helpful reference for a new
user.
<P>
Resources listed are grouped by types into sections.  Current sections
include descriptions of online
<A NAME="IDX112">library</A>
catalogs, data archives, online
white pages directory services, networks, network information centers,
and computational resources, such as supercomputers.  Each entry
describes the resource, identifies who can use the resource, explains
how to reach the local network via the Internet, and lists contacts
for more information.  The list is distributed electronically by the
NNSC.  To receive a guide, or to get on a mailing list that alerts you
to when it is updated, send a message to
<CODE>resource-guide-request@nnsc.nsf.net</CODE>.
<P>
The current edition of the IRG is available via anonymous FTP from
<CODE>nnsc.nsf.net</CODE>, in the directory <TT>`/resource-guide'</TT>.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC102" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC102">Requests for Comments</A></H2>
<P>
The internal workings of the Internet are defined by a set of documents
called
<A NAME="IDX113">RFCs (Request for Comments)</A>.
The general process for creating
an RFC is for someone wanting something formalized to write a document
describing the issue and mailing it to Jon Postel
(<CODE>postel@isi.edu)</CODE>.  He acts as a referee for the proposal.  It is
then commented upon by all those wishing to take part in the discussion
(electronically, of course).  It may go through multiple revisions.
Should it be generally accepted as a good idea, it will be assigned a
number and filed with the RFCs.
<P>
The RFCs can be divided into five groups: required, suggested,
directional, informational and obsolete.  Required RFCs
(e.g., RFC-791, <CITE>The Internet Protocol</CITE>) must be implemented on any host
connected to the Internet.
<P>
Suggested RFCs are generally implemented by network hosts.  Lack of
them does not preclude access to the Internet, but may impact its
usability.  RFC-793, <CITE>Transmission Control Protocol</CITE>, is a
must for those implementing TCP.
<P>
Directional RFCs were discussed and agreed to, but their application
has never come into wide use.  This may be due to the lack of wide
need for the specific application (RFC-937, <CITE>The Post Office Protocol</CITE>) or
that, although technically superior, ran against other pervasive
approaches (RFC-891, <CITE>Hello</CITE>).  It is suggested that, should the facility
be required by a particular site, an implementation be done in
accordance with the RFC.  This ensures that, should the idea be one
whose time has come, the implementation will be in accordance with
some standard and will be generally usable.
<P>
Informational RFCs contain factual information about the Internet and
its operation (RFC-990, <CITE>Assigned Numbers</CITE>).
<P>
There is also a subset of RFCs called FYIs (For Your Information).
They are written in a language much more informal than that used in
the other, standard RFCs.  Topics range from answers to common
questions for new and experienced users to a suggested bibliography.
<P>
Finally, as the Internet has grown and technology has changed, some
RFCs become unnecessary.  These obsolete RFCs cannot be ignored,
however.  Frequently when a change is made to some RFC that causes a
new one to obsolete others, the new RFC only contains explanations and
motivations for the change.  Understanding the model on which the
whole facility is based may involve reading the original and
subsequent RFCs on the topic.
<P>
RFCs and FYIs are available via FTP from many sources, including:
<UL>
<LI>
The <CODE>nic.ddn.mil</CODE> archive, as <TT>`/rfc/rfc-<VAR>xxxx</VAR>.txt'</TT>, where
<VAR>xxxx</VAR> is the number of the RFC.
<P>
<LI>
from <CODE>ftp.uu.net</CODE>, in the directory <TT>`/RFC'</TT>.
</UL>
<P>
They're also available through mail by writing to <CODE>service@nic.ddn.mil</CODE>,
with a <SAMP>`Subject:'</SAMP> line of <KBD>send RFC-<VAR>xxxx</VAR>.TXT</KBD>, again with
<VAR>xxxx</VAR> being the RFC number. To learn about archive servers,

<H1><A NAME="SEC104" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC104">Getting to Other Networks</A></H1>
<P>
Inter-connectivity has been and always will be one of the biggest
goals in computer networking.  The ultimate desire is to make it so
one person can contact anyone else no matter where they are.  A number
of
<A NAME="IDX117">"gateways"</A>
between networks have been set up.  They include:
<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>AppleLink
<DD>
Quantum Services sells access to
<A NAME="IDX118"><DFN>AppleLink</DFN></A>
, which is similar to
QuantumLink for Commodore computers and PCLink for IBM PCs and
compatibles.  It also provides email access through the address
<SAMP>`<VAR>user</VAR>@applelink.apple.com'</SAMP>.
<P>
<DT>ATTMail
<DD>AT&#38;T sells a commercial email service called <DFN>ATTMail</DFN>.  Its users
can be reached by writing to <SAMP>`<VAR>user</VAR>@attmail.com'</SAMP>.
<P>
<DT>BIX
<DD>Users on BIX (the Byte Information eXchange) can be reached
through the DAS gateway at <SAMP>`<VAR>user</VAR>@dcibix.das.net'</SAMP>.
<P>
<DT>CompuServe (CI$)
<DD>
To reach a user on the commercial service
<A NAME="IDX119"><DFN>CompuServe</DFN></A>
, you must
address the mail as <CODE><VAR>xxxxx.xxx</VAR>@compuserve.com</CODE>, with
<VAR>xxxxx.xxx</VAR> being their CompuServe user ID.  Normally CompuServe
ids are represented as being separated by a comma (like
<CODE>71999,141</CODE>); since most mailers don't react well to having
commas in addresses, it was changed to a period.  For the above
address, mail would be sent to <SAMP>`71999.141@compuserve.com'</SAMP>.
<P>
<DT>EasyNet
<DD>Digital sells a service called EasyNet; users that subscribe to it can
be reached with the addresses <CODE><VAR>user</VAR>@host.enet.dec.com</CODE> or
<SAMP>`<VAR>user</VAR>%host.enet@decwrl.dec.com'</SAMP>.
<P>
<DT>FidoNet
<DD>The FidoNet computer network can be reached by using a special
addressing method.  If John Smith is on the node <SAMP>`1:2/3.4'</SAMP> on
FidoNet, his or her email address would be
<SAMP>`john.smith@p<STRONG>4</STRONG>.f<STRONG>3</STRONG>.n<STRONG>2</STRONG>.z<STRONG>1</STRONG>.fidonet.org'</SAMP>
(notice how the numbers fall in place?).
<P>
<DT>MCI Mail
<DD><A NAME="IDX120"></A>
MCI also sells email accounts (similar to ATTMail). Users can be
reached with <SAMP>`<VAR>user</VAR>@mcimail.com'</SAMP>.
<P>
<DT>PeaceNet
<DD>Users on the PeaceNet network can be reached by writing to
<SAMP>`<VAR>user</VAR>@igc.org'</SAMP>.
<P>
</DL>
<P>
This table is far from complete.  In addition to sites not being
listed, some services are not (nor do they plan to be) accessible from
the "outside" (like Prodigy); others, like GEnie, are actively
investigating the possibility of creating a gateway into their system.
For the latest information, consult a list called the
<CITE>Inter-Network Mail Guide</CITE>.  It's available from a number of
<A NAME="IDX121">FTP</A>
sites, including UUNET; see section <A HREF="zen-1.0_4.html#SEC16">Anonymous FTP</A>, for more information on
getting a copy of it using anonymous FTP.

<TITLE>Zen and the Art of the Internet - Retrieving Files via Email</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="zen-1.0_12.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="zen-1.0_14.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H1><A NAME="SEC105" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC105">Retrieving Files via Email</A></H1>
<P>
For those who have a connection to the Internet, but cannot FTP, there
do exist a few alternatives to get those files you so desperately
need.  When requesting files, it's imperative that you keep in mind
the size of your request--odds are the other people who may be using
your link won't be too receptive to sudden bursts of really heavy
traffic on their normally sedate connection.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC106" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC106">Archive Servers</A></H2>
<P>
An alternative to the currently well over-used FTPmail system is
taking advantage of the many <DFN>archive servers</DFN> that are presently
being maintained.  These are programs that receive email messages that
contain commands, and act on them.  For example, sending an archive
server the command <SAMP>`help'</SAMP> will usually yield, in the form of a
piece of email, information on how to use the various commands that
the server has available.
<P>
One such archive server is <SAMP>`service@nic.ddn.mil'</SAMP>.  Maintained by
the Network Information Center (NIC) in Chantilly, VA, the server is
set up to make all of the information at the NIC available for people
who don't have access to FTP.  This also includes the WHOIS service
(see section <A HREF="zen-1.0_7.html#SEC83">The WHOIS Database</A>). Some sample <SAMP>`Subject:'</SAMP> lines for queries to the
NIC server are:
<P>
<PRE>
Subject: help                          <VAR>Describes available commands.</VAR>
Subject: rfc 822                       <VAR>Sends a copy of RFC-822.</VAR>
Subject: rfc index                     <VAR>Sends an index of the available RFCs.</VAR>
Subject: netinfo domain-template.txt   <VAR>Sends a domain application.</VAR>
Subject: whois widener                 <VAR>Sends WHOIS information on `widener'.</VAR>
</PRE>
<P>
More information on using their archive server can be obtained by
writing to their server address <CODE>service@nic.ddn.mil</CODE> with a
<SAMP>`Subject:'</SAMP> of <KBD>help</KBD>.
<P>
There are different "brands" of archive server, each with its own
set of commands and services.  Among them there often exists a common
set of commands and services (e.g. <SAMP>`index'</SAMP>, <SAMP>`help'</SAMP>, etc).
Be that as it may, one should always consult the individual help for a
specific server before assuming the syntax--100K surprises can be
hard on a system.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC107" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC107">FTP-by-Mail Servers</A></H2>
Some systems offer people the ability to receive files through a
mock-FTP interface via email.  See section <A HREF="zen-1.0_4.html#SEC16">Anonymous FTP</A> for a general overview of
how to FTP.  The effects of providing such a service varies, although
a rule of thumb is that it will probably use a substantial amount of
the available resources on a system.
<P>
The "original" FTP-by-Mail service,
<A NAME="IDX122">BITFTP</A>
, is available to BITNET
users from the Princeton node <CODE>PUCC</CODE>.  It was once accessible to
anyone, but had to be closed out to non-BITNET users because of the
heavy load on the system.
<P>
In response to this closure, Paul Vixie designed and installed a
system called
<A NAME="IDX123">FTPmail</A>
on one of Digital's gateway computers,
<CODE>decwrl.dec.com</CODE>.  Write to <SAMP>`ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com'</SAMP> with
<SAMP>`help'</SAMP> in the body of the letter for instructions on its use.
The software is undergoing constant development; once it reaches a
stable state, other sites will be encouraged to adopt it and provide
the service also.

<TITLE>Zen and the Art of the Internet - Newsgroup Creation</TITLE>
<P>Go to the <A HREF="zen-1.0_13.html">previous</A>, <A HREF="zen-1.0_15.html">next</A> section.<P>
<H1><A NAME="SEC108" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC108">Newsgroup Creation</A></H1>
<P>
Everyone has the opportunity to make a <DFN>Call For Votes</DFN> on the
Usenet and attempt to create a newsgroup that he/she feels would be of
benefit to the general readership.  The rules governing newsgroup
creation have evolved over the years into a generally accepted method.
They only govern the "world" groups; they aren't applicable to
regional or other alternative hierarchies.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC109" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC109">Discussion</A></H2>
<P>
A discussion must first take place to address issues like the naming
of the group, where in the group tree it should go (e.g.
<CODE>rec.sports.koosh</CODE> vs <CODE>rec.games.koosh</CODE>?), and whether or
not it should be created in the first place.  The formal <DFN>Request
For Discussion</DFN> (RFD) should be posted to
<CODE>news.announce.newgroups</CODE>, along with any other groups or mailing
lists at all related to the proposed topic.
<CODE>news.announce.newgroups</CODE> is moderated.  You should place it
first in the <SAMP>`Newsgroups:'</SAMP> header, so that it will get mailed to
the moderator <EM>only</EM>.  The article won't be immediately posted to
the other newsgroups listed; rather, it will give you the opportunity
to have the moderator correct any inconsistencies or mistakes in your
RFD.  He or she will take care of posting it to the newsgroups you
indicated.  Also the <SAMP>`Followup-To:'</SAMP> header will be set so that the
actual discussion takes place only in <CODE>news.groups</CODE>.  If a user
has difficulty posting to a moderated group, he or she may mail
submissions intended for <CODE>news.announce.newgroups</CODE> to the address
<SAMP>`announce-newgroups@rpi.edu'</SAMP>.
<P>
The final name and <DFN>charter</DFN> of the group, and whether it will be
moderated or unmoderated, will be determined during the discussion
period.  If it's to be moderated, the discussion will also decide who
the moderator will be.  If there's no general agreement on these
points among those in favor of a new group at the end of 30 days,
the discussion will be taken into mail rather than continued posting
to <CODE>news.groups</CODE>; that way, the proponents of the group can iron out
their differences and come back with a proper proposal, and make
a new Request For Discussion.
<A NAME="IDX124"></A>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC110" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC110">Voting</A></H2>
After the discussion period (which is mandatory), if it's been
determined that a new group really is desired, a name and charter are
agreed upon, and it's been determined whether the group will be
moderated (and by whom), a <DFN>Call For Votes</DFN> (CFV) should be posted
to <CODE>news.announce.newgroups</CODE>, along with any other groups that
the original Request For Discussion was posted to.  The CFV should be
posted (or mailed to the <CODE>news.announce.newgroups</CODE> moderator) as
soon as possible after the discussion ends (to keep it fresh in
everyone's mind).
<P>
The Call for Votes should include clear instructions on how to cast a
vote.  It's important that it be clearly explained how to both vote
for <EM>and</EM> against a group (and be of equivalent difficulty or
ease).  If it's easier for you or your administrator, two separate
addresses can be used to mail yes and no votes to, providing that
they're on the same machine.  Regardless of the method, everyone
must have a very specific idea of how to get his/her vote counted.
<P>
The voting period can last between 21 and 31 days, no matter what the
preliminary results of the vote are.  A vote can't be called off
simply because 400 "no" votes have come in and only two "yes"
votes.  The Call for Votes should include the exact date that the
voting period will end--only those votes arriving on the vote-taker's
machine before this date can be counted.
<P>
To keep awareness high, the CFV can be repeated during the vote,
provided that it gives the same clear, unbiased instructions for
casting a vote as the original; it also has to be the same proposal as
was first posted.  The charter can't change in mid-vote. Also, votes
that're posted don't count--only those that were mailed to the
vote-taker can be tallied.
<P>
Partial results should <EM>never</EM> be included; only a statement of
the specific proposal, that a vote is in progress on it, and how to
cast a vote.  A mass acknowledgement ("Mass ACK" or "Vote ACK") is
permitted; however, it must be presented in a way that gives no
indication of which way a person voted.  One way to avoid this is to
create one large list of <EM>everyone</EM> who's voted, and sort it in
alphabetical order.  It should not be two sorted lists (of the yes and
no votes, respectively).
<P>
Every vote is autonomous.  The votes for or against one group can't be
transferred to another, similar proposal.  A vote can only count for
the <EM>exact</EM> proposal that it was a response to.  In particular, a vote
for or against a newsgroup under one name can't be counted as a vote
for or against another group with a different name or charter, a
different moderated/unmoderated status, or, if it's moderated, a
different <A NAME="IDX125">moderator</A> or set of moderators.  Whew!
<P>
Finally, the vote has to be explicit; they should be of the form <SAMP>`I
vote for the group foo.bar as proposed'</SAMP> or <SAMP>`I vote against the group
foo.bar as proposed'</SAMP>.  The wording doesn't have to be exact, your
intention just has to be clear.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC111" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC111">The Result of a Vote</A></H2>
<P>
At the end of the voting period, the vote-taker has to post (to
<CODE>news.announce.newgroups</CODE>) the tally and email addresses of the votes
received.  Again, it can also be posted to any of the groups listed in
the original CFV.  The tally should make clear which way a person
voted, so the results can be verified if it proves necessary to do so.
<P>
After the vote result is posted to <CODE>news.announce.newgroups</CODE>,
there is a mandatory five-day waiting period.  This affords everyone
the opportunity to correct any errors or inconsistencies in the voter
list or the voting procedure.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="SEC112" HREF="zen-1.0_toc.html#SEC112">Creation of the Group</A></H2>
<P>
If, after the waiting period, there are no serious objections that
might invalidate the vote, the vote is put to the "water test."  If
there were 100 more valid <SAMP>`YES/create'</SAMP> votes than <SAMP>`NO/don't'</SAMP>
create votes, <EM>and</EM> at least two-thirds of the total number of votes are
in favor of creation, then a newgroup control message can be sent out
(often by the moderator of <CODE>news.announce.newgroups</CODE>).  If the 100-vote
margin or the two-thirds percentage isn't met, the group has failed
and can't be created.
<P>
If the proposal failed, all is not lost--after a six-month waiting
period (a "cooling down"), a new Request For Discussion can be posted
to <CODE>news.groups</CODE>, and the whole process can start over again.  If after
a couple of tries it becomes obvious that the group is <EM>not</EM>
wanted or needed, the vote-taker should humbly step back and accept
the opinion of the majority.  (As life goes, so goes Usenet.)

This glossary is only a tiny subset of all of the various terms and
other things that people regularly use on The Net.  For a more
complete (and very entertaining) reference, it's suggested you get a
copy of <CITE>The New Hacker's Dictionary</CITE>, which is based on a VERY
large text file called the Jargon File.  Edited by Eric Raymond

<P>
<STRONG>network</STRONG>
A group of machines connected together so they can transmit information
to one another.  There are two kinds of networks: local networks and
remote networks.
<P>
<STRONG>NFS (Network File System)</STRONG>

question.  The word `Fantastic' is usually replaced with one much more
vulgar.
<P>
<STRONG>SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)</STRONG>
The Internet standard protocol for transferring electronic mail messages
from one computer to another.  SMTP specifies how two mail systems
interact and the format of control messages they exchange to transfer
mail.
<P>
<STRONG>server</STRONG>
A computer that shares its resources, such as printers and files, with
other computers on the network.  An example of this is a Network File
System (NFS) server which shares its disk space with other computers.
<P>
<STRONG>signal-to-noise ratio</STRONG>
When used in reference to Usenet activity, <SAMP>`signal-to-noise
ratio'</SAMP> describes the relation between amount of actual information in
a discussion, compared to their quantity.  More often than not,
there's substantial activity in a newsgroup, but a very small number
of those articles actually contain anything useful.
<P>
<STRONG>signature</STRONG>
The small, usually four-line message at the bottom of a piece of email
or a Usenet article.  In Unix, it's added by creating a file
<TT>`.signature'</TT> in the user's home directory.  Large signatures are
a no-no.
<P>
<STRONG>summarize</STRONG>
To encapsulate a number of responses into one coherent, usable

support services such as remote login (telnet), file transfer
(FTP) and mail (SMTP).
<P>
<STRONG>telnet</STRONG>
The Internet standard protocol for remote terminal connection service.
Telnet allows a user at one site to interact with a remote timesharing
system at another site as if the user's terminal were connected directly
to the remote computer.
<P>
<STRONG>terminal server</STRONG>
A small, specialized, networked computer that connects many terminals to
a LAN through one network connection.  Any user on the network can then
connect to various network hosts.
<P>
<STRONG>TeX</STRONG>

Examples are Sun workstations and Digital DECstations.
<P>
<A NAME="IDX133"><STRONG>worm</STRONG></A>
A computer program which replicates itself.  The Internet worm
(see section <A HREF="zen-1.0_9.html#SEC90">The Internet Worm</A>) was perhaps the most famous; it

<h2>POSTGRADUATE DIPLOMA AND MSC DEGREE COURSES  SOL.2/3</h2>

<h1>SOIL SURVEY AND APPLICATIONS OF SOIL INFORMATION 1996</h1>

Soil information varies widely in quality and quantity from country to country. The nature, location
and value of soil resources are still unknown over large regions. Available information is frequently
inappropriate when compared with the objectives of land use planning, especially at local and
regional levels.
<p>
Simultaneously, the development of soil databases, geographic information systems (GIS) and
modelling is creating an increased need for more and improved soil data. Training in soil survey and
related soil science fields is therefore vitally important.
<p>
The Soil Science Division of ITC is concerned with education, research and consulting in soil
resource inventory and its applications to land evaluation, conservation and management in rural,
peri-urban and urban environments.
<p>
The postgraduate diploma course (course code SOL.3) and the MSc degree course (SOL.2) are
organized by the Soil Science Division of ITC's Department of Land Resource and Urban Sciences.
<p>
The department also offers courses in forest survey, rural and land ecology survey, urban survey
and human settlement analysis, forestry for rural development, socio-economic information for
natural resource management, environmental systems analysis and monitoring, geoinformation
systems for rural applications, geoinformation systems for urban applications.
<p>
The SOL courses deal with surveying, processing, interpreting and transferring (to users) soil data
and information. Subjects covered include the genesis, characteristics, distribution, present
utilization and potential multipurpose use of soil resources, particularly in developing countries.
<p>
In the courses, extensive use is made of aerial photo and satellite image interpretation, as well as
field prospecting and laboratory determinations. Digital processing of satellite remote sensing data
and geographic information systems (GIS) are intensively employed.

<h2>OBJECTIVES</h2>

Upon completion of the courses, participants should be able to:
<ul>
<li> carry out and contribute to soil surveys with emphasis on the use of aerospace remote sensing
   techniques;
<li> apply a sound knowledge of the multipurpose utilization of soil survey information and the use of
   geographic information systems;
<li> carry out applied research in selected soil science fields (SOL.2).
</ul>
<p>
To achieve these objectives, participants will:
<ul>
<li> take part in lectures and practicals in about equal proportion;
<li> prepare, execute and report on a soil survey fieldwork project (SOL.3);
<li> plan and implement a research project and write an MSc thesis (SOL.2).
</ul>

<h2>TARGET GROUPS</h2>

The SOL.3 course is intended for soil scientists, agronomists and other professionals, trained at
university level and engaged in soil survey for government or private organizations. It is also suitable
for university/college staff teaching the subject.
The SOL.2 course is intended for professionals who wish to develop their knowledge and skills in soil
science or a closely related field, including mapping based on aerial photos and other remote sensing
data and the use of geographic information systems.

<h2>ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATIONS</h2>

For admission to the SOL.3 and SOL.2 courses, applicants should hold a BSc degree from a recognized
university in one of the disciplines in which soil science is part of the curriculum, or be able to
demonstrate an equivalent level of education in one of these disciplines. Preferably they should also
have some years of working experience. 
<p>
Applicants for the SOL.2 course should have gained their BSc degree with good marks.
They should attain an average weighted mark of at least 75 in the SOL.3 course and show an aptitude
for independent study.
<p>
Interpretation of aerial photographs and satellite images is an important part of the course curriculum.
Candidates should therefore have good stereoscopic vision as well as normal colour vision. Proficiency
in the English language is also required (minimum requirement Test of English as a Foreign Language
(TOEFL) 500 or British Council test 6.0).
<p>
Applications for admission should be forwarded directly to ITC using the official application form which
is available from ITC's Student Registration Office.

<h2>COURSE STRUCTURE AND CONTENTS</h2>

allowance including accommodation is estimated at NLG 1,545 per person per month. Please note that
international travel expenses are not included.

<h2>FELLOWSHIPS</h2>

For SOL.3 and SOL.2 course applicants from selected developing countries, the Netherlands'
government awards some fellowships under the Netherlands Fellowship Programme (NFP). In
accordance with Netherlands government policy, women are especially encouraged to apply. NFP
fellowship applications should be submitted through the appropriate organization in the candidate's
home country and with the approval of the candidate's employer, to reach the Royal Netherlands
Embassy at least four months before the starting date of the course. 
<p>
Since the number of NFP fellowships is rather limited, course applicants are advised to try to obtain
funding from other donor agencies. Details and addresses of sponsors in the applicant's country can
be obtained from the ITC Student Registration Office. Please note that ITC has no funds of its own,
neither does ITC have any influence on those organizations that grant fellowships.

<h2>FURTHER INFORMATION</h2>

The International Institute for Aerospace Surveys and Earth Sciences (ITC) is the largest institute for
international higher education in the Netherlands. The main objective of ITC is to assist developing
countries in human resources development in aerospace surveys, remote sensing applications, the
establishment of geographic information systems and the management of geoinformation.

<h2>POSTGRADUATE DIPLOMA AND MSC DEGREE COURSE  FOR.2/3</h2>

<h1>FOREST SURVEY 1996</h1>

The intensifying pressure on forest resources and the growing awareness of their crucial  role in our
environment places increasing demands on the knowledge and skills of foresters. They must be
able to manage and develop forest resources in order to provide a sustainable supply of timber,
water and other related products and services.
<p>
The preparation, control and execution of a forest management plan require a wide range of
information, much of which is spatially referenced. Remote sensing and geographic information
systems (GIS) are now considered indispensable instruments in the supply of up-to-date information
for forest management.
<p>
ITC's postgraduate diploma (course code FOR.3) and MSc degree (FOR.2) Forest Survey courses
focus on the application of remote sensing and GIS in the problem areas of sustainable manage
ment of closed forests, rehabilitation of degraded (forest) land, and watershed management and
environmental protection. In the MSc course, management of woody biomass for energy in rural
areas is also addressed. Candidates interested in the energy specialisation should request for the
special brochure on rural energy and development.
<p>
The courses are organized by ITC's Forest Science Division of the Department of Land Resource
and Urban Sciences. Related courses include forestry for rural development, rural and land ecology
survey, soil survey and socio-economic information for natural resource management.

<h2>OBJECTIVES</h2>

The Forest Survey courses are designed to strengthen forestry and related institutions, by training
staff in the acquisition and use of aerospace information and GIS for forest management.
<p>
Upon completion of the course, participants should be able to:
<ul>
<li>define the multidisciplinary nature of forest management;
<li>identify an organization's needs for geographic information in problem areas;
<li>select a cost-effective forest survey design for acquisition of aerospace and ground data;
<li>analyze aerospace images and collect field data;
<li>integrate the data into a geographic information system (GIS);
<li>operate a GIS to support decision-making for forest management.
</ul>
<p>
In addition to the above, the participants in the MSc degree course in Forest Survey should be
able to:
<ul>
<li>appraise, design, implement and evaluate methods for cost-effective data collection and data
       management for the survey and monitoring of forest land;
<li>use a decision-support system to prepare alternative models for forest management.
</ul>
<p>
To achieve these objectives, participants will:
<ul>
<li>work periodically with participants from other courses, involved in natural resource management;
<li>critically study and compare survey designs to meet user requirements;
<li>work extensively with aerial photographs and satellite images, and with    geographic information
systems in several application fields;
<li>apply and validate the acquired knowledge and skills under field conditions.
</ul>
<p>
In addition, the MSc course participants will:
<ul>
<li>plan and implement a research project on methodological aspects of aerospace survey, or on
       developing alternative management plans using a decision-support system
</ul>


<h2>TARGET GROUPS</h2>

The course is designed for officers employed by forest agencies and staff from forestry training institutes
wishing to develop their knowledge and skills in the field of forest survey.

<h2>ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS AND APPLICATIONS</h2>

For admission to the FOR.3 and FOR.2 courses, applicants should hold a BSc or BA degree from a
recognized university in forestry or in one of the earth, agricultural or social sciences, or be able to
demonstrate an equivalent level of education in one of these disciplines. They preferably should also
have some years of working experience. 
<p>
Applicants for the FOR.2 course should have gained their BSc degree with good marks. Applicants
intending to carry out an MSc study in the field of "Forestry for Rural Development" or "Rural Energy
and Development" will both follow the FRD.3 programme during the first seven months. For further
information see the FRD.3 brochure and the special brochure on "MSc degree courses in Rural Energy
and Development". However, they should both apply for the FOR.2 course.
<p>
ITC alumni should have attained an average weighted mark of at least 75 in their FOR.3 or FRD.3
course and show an aptitude for independent study.
<p>
Interpretation of aerial photographs and satellite images is an important part of the course curriculum.

<h2>POSTGRADUATE DIPLOMA COURSE RLE.3</h2>

<h1>RURAL AND LAND ECOLOGY SURVEY 1996</h1>

The 'green cover' of the Earth, including both agricultural crops and natural vegetation, provides the materials
to meet the basic needs of mankind for food, fuel, fiber and shelter. The increasing size and demands of the
population cause a continuous change of the green cover of the earth. This process may be the direct result
of operations on a particular piece of land, or it may be an indirect result of, for example, pollution or global
atmospheric change.
<p>
Up-to-date knowledge on the state of the green cover of the earth, and the agricultural land use which affects
it, is essential for the sustainable development of agricultural lands, as well as the conservation of our natural
heritage. The survey of the green cover and the way it is exploited, with the modern techniques remote sensing
(RS) and geographic information systems (GIS) is the focal point of this course.
<p>
The postgraduate diploma course (course code RLE.3) is organized by the Vegetation and Agricultural
Sciences Division within ITC's Department of Land Resource and Urban Sciences. The department also offers
courses in the fields of forest survey, soil survey, urban survey, and socio-economic information for natural
resources management.
<p>
The participants of the Msc course follow the taught modules of the postgraduate course, after which they
begin with an individual research project, resulting in a thesis. For further information please refer to the
brochure on the MSc course.

<h2>OBJECTIVES</h2>

The learning objective of the course is to develop the participant's skills to survey plant cover and agricultural
land use in rural, i.e. non-urban, areas using remote sensing and GIS techniques.
<p>

<ul>
<li>translate the geoinformation requirements on plant cover and agricultural land use of a client agency into
specific objectives, methodologies and a survey plan and to carry out the survey;
 <li>collect ground survey data on plant cover and agricultural land use;
 <li>correlate ground survey data with aerial photography and satellite images in a GIS environment;
 <li>prepare a plant cover or agricultural land use database and map.
</ul>

<h2>TARGET GROUPS</h2>

The course is designed for mid career professionals requiring training in the survey of plant cover and
agricultural land use for rural development, environmental conservation or natural resource management
purposes.
<p>
The course therefore addresses primarily those with a professional background in agriculture, rangeland
management, landscape ecology, environmental management, nature conservation or related subjects. They
may be working in survey and rural development organizations, extension services, research institutes and
university departments, or projects and non-governmental organizations.

<h3>MSC DEGREE COURSE (SIG.2)</h3>

The first seven blocks of the SIG.2 course are identical to the SIG.3 course. The remainder of the programme
offers two different specializations in natural resource management: Land Use Planning or Rural Energy and
Development.
<p>
The specialisations continue for four months course work (March through June) with blocks of lectures, practicals
and workshops, and with emphasis given to library research, self-study and seminars.
<p>
The final and significant element of the MSc programme is the writing of a research thesis which involves
literature review, research design, field research, writing and presentation, within the context of social science
research interests. This occupies the final seven months, July to January.
<p>
In addition to the objectives of the overall SIG course, the Land Use Planning specialisation should improve the
participants' abilities to:
<ul>
<li> analyze the issues, institutions and parties involved in land use planning for development;
<li> design social survey techniques for land use planning information requirements, including airphoto
interpretation, socio-economic surveys and rapid rural appraisal;
<li> utilize and interpret GIS tools for land use planning;
<li> assess and perform techniques in land use planning, including land evaluation, environmental impact
assessment, economic evaluation, and decision support methods;
<li> critically assess information needs for implemention of policy instruments in land use planning/NRM policies.
</ul>
<p>
The objectives of the Rural Energy Development specialization in SIG.2 are to improve the participants' ability
to:
<ul>
<li> utilize social and economic analytical tools for rural energy planning;

<h2>MSC DEGREE COURSE  RLE.2</h2>

<h1>RURAL AND LAND ECOLOGY SURVEY 1996</h1>
<p>
The 'green cover' of the earth, which includes both agricultural crops and natural vegetation, provides
basic needs of mankind. The increasing size and demand of the population causes a continuous change
of the green cover of the earth. 
<p>
Sustainable development of agricultural lands, as well as the conservation of our natural heritage, requires
up-to-date information on plant cover and agricultural land use.  Mapping and monitoring techniques
contribute to the acquisition of this information. Modelling, land evaluation and land use planning methods
integrate this information with data from other sources and provide management options.
<p>
The course (course code RLE.2) is organized by the Vegetation and Agricultural Sciences Division within
ITC's Department of Land Resource and Urban Sciences, which also organizes other courses in the field
of forest survey, soil survey, urban survey and socio-economic information for natural resource
management.

<h2>MSc DEGREE COURSE</h2>

<h1>ENVIRONMENTAL SYSTEMS ANALYSIS AND MONITORING 1996</h1>

The present concern about environmental issues results in an increasing need for environmental expertise.
ITC's course in "Environmental Systems Analysis and Monitoring" is a response to this need.
<p>
The course offers in-depth training in the use of remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) for
environmental monitoring, modelling and assessment.
<p>
The interdepartmental course is executed jointly by staff of the Department of Land Resource and Urban
Sciences (LARUS) and the Department of Earth Resources Surveys (ERS) of ITC. The multi- disciplinary
character of environmental studies is addressed by using the expertise available in the various specialist survey
divisions of the institute.
<p>
The ESM.2 course was designed to include the first 8 months of any of the followingdiploma courses dealing
with natural resource management: SOL.3, FOR.3, FRD.3, RLE.3, SIG.3. At the moment the main entry route
is still via RLE.3. Entry from several diploma courses of the Department of Earth Resources Surveys is possible
as well.

<h2>OBJECTIVES</h2>

<h1>WORKSHOP INFORMATION MANAGEMENT FOR NATURAL RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT</h1>


Economic development and concern for the environment require that
land resources should be handled with care.
<p>
Governmental institutions play an important role in influencing the process
of land use.
<p>
This is also referred to as Land Use Planning, Spatial Planning or Zoning.
Such planning requires a large amount of information on the natural
resources and on how people use them.
<p>
This information should be available to an organisation in a form and
correlation with other information that allows analysis comparison.
<p>
Data collection on land and land use has improved in the past decades
through the use of remote sensing.
<p>
Data storage and processing has improved with digital data base
techniques and the development of Geographic Information Systems
(GIS).
<p>
Quality of decisions can be improved trough the development of an
organization's information system which combines man, knowledge,
hardware and software. 
<p>
Organisations involved in land management deal with complex problems
and therefore have complex information systems.
It is vital that these systems should be well defined, developed and
managed in order to prevent inappropriate decisions and wasted
investments.
<p>
It is of great importance that management and staff of these organisations
are fully aware of the methods of information system development for their
particular type of work and the scope and limitations of techniques such as
remote sensing and GIS.
<p>
ITC's three-week workshop on Information Management for Natural
Resource Development has been designed for this purpose.
<p>
The workshop deals with the question of how geographic information
Systems can be used in organizations which deal with aspects of natural
resource management. It gives participants insight in theoretical, practical
and managerial aspects of GIS technology.
<p>
The code of the workshop is "SIG-5".
It is organized by ITC's department of Land Resource and Urban Sciences
and an interdepartmental course board on Geo Information Systems. 
<p>
The department also offers courses in: 
<ul>
<li><b>FOR</b>  Forest Survey
<li><b>RLE</b>  Rural and Land Ecology Survey
<li><b>USH</b>  Urban Survey and Human Settlement Analysis
<li><b>FRD</b>  Forestry for Rural Development
<li><b>SIG</b>  Socio-Economic Information for Natural Resource Management
<li><b>ESM</b>  Environmental Systems Analysis and Monitoring
<li><b>GIR</b>  Geographic information Systems for Rural Applications
<li><b>GIU</b>  Geographic information Systems for Urban Applications
</ul>




<h2>OBJECTIVES</h2>

To present an overview of aspects of the design, implementation and
management of GIS for land management organisations.
<p>
To explain the elements and functions of GIS.
<p>
To specify the data, data storage and data processing requirements of
information systems for land management.
<p>
To consider the managerial aspects of introducing digital information
technology in an organization.
<p>
To give participants some practical training with GIS.
<p>

Upon completion of the workshop, participants should be able to:
<ul>
<li>initiate, stimulate and participate in the process of information system
design and implementation;
<li> contribute to the specification of the data and information requirements
of the home organization;
<li> advice on the methods to be used to introduce digital information systems in
land- related organizations.
</ul>
<p>
To achieve these objectives participants will:
<ul>
<li>gain theoretical knowledge on geographic information systems for natural
resource management;
<li>be exposed to methods and techniques for system development;
<li>elaborate a case study with practical exercises;
<li>exchange experiences with fellow participants and ITC staff.
</ul>

<h2>TARGET GROUPS</h2>

The workshop is designed for senior level technical and management
staff of organizations handling land- related data for rural development,
environmental management, water resource development, etc.
It is also suitable for staff from universities, research and survey institutes,
etc., working in similar areas of specialization. 
 
<h2>ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS</h2>

Participants should hold a senior position with a reasonable amount
work experience in their organizations and have a good working knowledge
of English.
Some basic computer handling experience is an advantage but not a 
prerequisite. A maximum of 16 persons can be accommodated in the
workshop.
<p>
Applications for academic admission should be forwarded directly to
ITC using the official application form which is available from ITC's Student
Registration Office.

<h2>Workshop Structure and Contents</h2>

<dl>
<dt>Part 1.   NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT

<dd>Management will be discussed in the context of tasks of organizations. 
This requires a clear definition of what is to be managed, who is the
manager, and how this management can best be utilized and implemented
(what are the tools available).
<p>
The information required for management can then be assessed. Questions
will be raised and scenarios presented and workshop participants will be
actively involved in exercise to relate these to their own organizations.


<p>
<dt>Part 2.   INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND GIS.

<dd>The history of Information Systems and GIS is presented.
The characteristics of information systems in land management organisations
are further analyzed and the character of the spatial data (geo data) is
investigated.  
<p>
The theory and techniques of spatial data handling will be briefly outlined.
Participants will learn about the elements and operations of GIS.
<p>
Finally the specifications for a GIS to support management tasks can
be assessed.

<p>
<dt>Part 3.   DATA CAPTURE, STORAGE AND PROCESSING.

<dd>Attention is given to spatial data capture with the help of remote sensing
techniques.
Techniques for non spatial data acquisition are also discussed.
<p>
The data must be stored in a database for which an appropriate design
has to be made.
The theory of data modelling is discussed.
<p>
Modelling and optimization techniques to process data into information
are also reviewed.

<p>
<dt>Part 4.   EXERCISE TO DESIGN, IMPLEMENT AND OPERATE A GIS
     FOR NATURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT.

<dd>Participants will apply these techniques to an organization and carry out
an exercise with GIS software to familiarize themselves with the strengths
and weaknesses of such techniques for their management tasks.
<p>
Special attention is given to the management of the process of information
system development and implementation: which subsystems should receive
priority; how the correct hard and software can be selected, installed and
operated; what organizational changes are required.
<p>
Time is reserved for discussions, exchange of experiences and presentations
by the participants.
<p>
There are several workshop related excursions (in the Netherlands).

<H1>IPL Services</H1>

The Image Processing Laboratory (IPL) of ITC offers several production services to staff and
students from ITC and <i>third parties</i>. Since there have been changes in the hard- and software configuration at the IPL
in the recent years, a new overview of the total package of services is required. In first instance we
will use the Geoinformatics Quarterly Report to inform staff from the Department on our services.
Eventually we will inform the rest of ITC via the CCRS.
<p>
The production services of IPL can be subdivided into four main categories :
<ul>
<li>Input
<li>Image Processing/Conversion
<li>Output
<li>Network
</ul>


<h2>Input Services</h2>

IPL can import data from various systems into its environment. Basically there are two types of input
:
<ul>
<li>    Extracting <b>digital</b> data from computer storage media (e.g. tapes, floppy disks)
<li>    Scanning <b>hardcopy</b> material (e.g. maps, photographs)
</ul>

For scanning, the IPL has a SHARP JX-300 color scanner (A4 size) connected to an Archimedes RISC
Computer. The scanner is capable of scanning at a maximum resolution of 300 dpi in Black and
White or in 24 bit color (256 steps in Red, Green and in Blue). The output from the scanning
system is a TIFF file which can be converted to various other formats on various different media (for
details please read Output Services).
<p>
IPL has contacts with other laboratories that can scan at higher densities
and larger formats.
<p>
The IPL has access to the following input devices :
<ul>
<li>hp2      - DAT (Digital Audio Tape) 1.2 Gb capacity
<li>hp2      - MO (Magneto-Optical) 2x650Mb capacity
<li>hp2      - Floppy disks (3&#189;" High Density)
<li>sun1     - QIC Streamer tape 250 Mb capacity
<li>sun2     - CCT (Computer Compatible Tapes) reader (1600-6250 bpi density)
<li>sun2     - EXABYTE (8mm) 2.5Gb+5Gb+compressed capacity
<li>sun2     - CD-ROM (ISO 9660)
<li>pc        - QIC Streamer Tape (DOSARCH)
<li>pc        - QIC Streamer Tape (SYTOS)
<li>pc        - Floppy disks (3&#189;", 5&#188;" Low/High Density)
<li>Frame grabbers - single frame from VHS and SVHS both PAL as well as NTSC
</ul>


The image data on the media can have the following formats :
<ul>
<li> ILWIS                  
<li>GIF
<li> ERDAS (lan, gis, ant)       
<li>PM (Portable Map)
<li> ERDAS (img)            
<li>PBM (Portable Bit Map)
<li> POSTSCRIPT             
<li>X11 (Bitmap)
<li> PCX                         
<li>IRIS
<li> SUN RASTER FILE        
<li>JPEG
<li> TIFF                        
<li>BMP (Windows Bitmap)
<li> GRID (ARC/INFO)             
<li>GRASS
<li> SPANSS                 
<li>X windows raster 
<li>and many others!
</ul>
<p>

IPL can also handle data which has been compressed or combined into an archive. The following
archives can be read :
<ul>
<li> DOSARCH format (QIC Streamer Tape)  
<li> SYTOS format (QIC Streamer Tape)
<li> UNIX tar and cpio archives (on DAT, EXABYTE or CD-ROM)
<li> UNIX compress and gzip
<li> FASTBACK archives
<li> DOS BACKUP archives (only for some specific versions of DOS)
<li> PKZIP and Unix zip
</ul>

Data can only be extracted from the media which is used for the input devices, when the data
format/structure is known. If the structure is not known then extraction can become a time
consuming trial and error procedure.


<h2>Processing/Conversion Services</h2>

Since the IPL is an image processing laboratory the possibilities in processing of data are almost
unlimited. Within the framework of this report just a few important and usually time consuming
procedures will be mentioned :
<ul>
     <li>    Radiometric and geometric corrections. Geo-referencing can be done if Ground
          Control (Maps or GPS) is supplied.
     <li>    Contrast enhancement, saturation enhancement, spatial enhancement (filtering).
     <li>    Spectral and spatial classification.
     <li>    DEM generation from stereoscopic SPOT data or aerial photographs. Ortho image
          generation from SPOT data or aerial photographs.
</ul>

The processing will in general be executed on the Hewlett Packard (HP) Unix Workstations. Only for specific
tasks or software IPL will rely on the SUN Workstations (Context Vision environment, Prodigeo) or on PC
configurations.
<p>
All machines of IPL are in a network offering a flexible working environment
for processing of large data sets.
<p>
A lists of image processing software packages at hand at the IPL :
<ul>
<li><a href="/ilwis/">Ilwis</a> (PC)
<li>Erdas (PC)
<li>Erdas (HP Workstation)
<li>Erdas IMAGINE (HP Workstation)
<li>XV (HP Workstation)
<li>DMS/SPM (PC)
<li>Alexander (PC)
<li>Alexander (Archimedes)
<li>Context Vision (SUN Workstation)
<li>Prodigeo (SUN Workstation)
<li>Khoros (HP Workstation)
</ul>


<h2>Output services</h2>

Output can be generated onto two different categories of media :
<ul>
<li>    Computer storage media (tapes, floppies etc.)
<li>    Hard copies on other media
</ul>

The long list of available input devices can serve (in reverse) as a list for the output devices
by IPL, except we don't have a CD-R (CD-Recordable). Thus data in various formats (see list of input formats) can transferred to
CCT, DAT, EXABYTE, Floppy disk, streamer tape etc. 
<p>
Hard copies can be generated on different quality levels. A lower quality can be generated
quickly and is usually cheaper.
<p>
Low quality (thermal wax color prints):
<ul>
<li>    300 dpi, 8 colors, A3 size print on paper
<li>    150 dpi, 125 colors, A3 size print on paper
<li>    100 dpi, 1000 colors, A3 size print on paper
<li>    75 dpi, 1728 colors, A3 size print on paper
</ul>

Medium quality (B&W and ink-jet):
<ul>
<li>    300 dpi B&W laserprint, A4 and A3 size print on paper
<li>    600 dpi B&W laserprint, A4 and A3 size print on paper
<li>    300 dpi color inkjet print, A4 and A3 on paper
</ul>

High quality :
<p>
The IPL has an Optronics film writer, which is capableof writing 10*10 inch
films at resolutions of 100, 50 and 25 micron! The following films can be used:
<ul>
<li>B&W negative (256 levels)
<li>Colour positives (16.7 mil. colors)
</ul>

The low quality color prints can be copied on color copy machines without loosing to much
information.
The high quality film plots can be enlarged by ITC Photolab up to a maximum size of 50*60 cm
(CIBACHROME). For larger formats the film has to be processed externally, by companies who will
charge exceptional prices. A format of > 100*100 cm within 24 hours service can be processed by
a photolab in Enschede. Output will have slightly reduced quality because of an additional
conversion to negative film.

<h2>Network Services</h2>
In addition to the above mentioned traditional input, output and Image
Processing services the IPL is also exploring the virtual world of the
Information Highway, the <i>Internet</i>. Currently the IPL runs the following
services:
<ul>
<li>An FTP-server on <a href="ftp://ftp.itc.nl/">ftp://ftp.itc.nl</a>
<li>A WWW-server on <a href="http://www.itc.nl/">http://www.itc.nl</a>
</ul>

If you need more information about these services,
please contact the IPL staff at

<br>
Furthermore, we welcome your <i>contributions</i> to these services.

DESCRIPTION OF DUTIES
                  Founded a private company, IMIX V.O.F. - Vision Support
                  Systems, together with two partners H.L.M. van Huijstee and P.
                  Kok.
                  Main objective of IMIX is to build low cost image processing
                  solutions (software and hardware) for industry and institutes.

                  Main market of IMIX:

                  o     Production factories:
                        o quality control  o detection
                        o process control  o measurement

                  o     Research institutes:
                        o image analysis   o data reduction
                        o Remote Sensing   o education

                  Relevant experience gathered during the IMIX period:
                  o     Extensive knowledge of the C language, shell scripts and
                        the Unix operating system.
                  o     Programming user interfaces in XWindows.
                  o     Installation and maintenance of many Public Domain (PD)
                        software packages, for example:
                        o     Postgres, a database management system from the
                              University of California. This was used to reach a
                              systematic approach of image processing using the
                              embedded query language of postgres (PostQuel)
                        o     Khoros, the extensive image processing package
                              from the University of New Mexico
                  o     Development and teaching of the course "Computer
                        Vision" at the Hogeschool Utrecht (pyrotechnical school) at
                        the division Industrial Automation and Computer Integrated
                        Manufacturing.
                        Writing of lecture notes for this course.
                  o     Maintenance and programming a Sun SparcStation 1+ with
                        VideoPix frame grabber board.
                  o     Consultancy to the ITC's Image Processing Laboratory
                        (IPL) for the production of satellite images, software
                        development and retrieving and maintenance of software
                        packages.

                        Production is: retrieving data, making subsets, hardcopies,
                        doing early stage processing, filtering, classification etc.

                        Production shifted from the old PDP's to the modern HP
                        workstations, making efficient use of available hardware
                        resources and the network.
                        The Erdas image file format was adapted as the standard
                        image format for programs.

                        Numerous packages were collected from the Internet and
                        adapted for IPL. These programs help to speed up
                        production and increase the capabilities of the IPL.

                        Used Hardware & Software at the ITC:
                        o     HP 9000/720 + HP-UX 9

the distribution of NOAA status and prediction bulletins for the
GOES and polar weather satellites.  This data is the same data
available via SCIENCEnet NOAA.SAT bulletin board area.  The mail
list also acts as a reflector for subscribers' comments and
discussion of matters related to weather satellites, ground
stations, and associated topics.

<br>Digital Image Processing of Remotely Sensed Data
<p>
The area of digital image processing of remotelly sensed data
should be the main topic of this club - so exactly the problems of
the interest  are the  methods  of  digital  image  processing  for
remotelly sensed data (like LANDSAT or SPOT) as well as microwave
and also new types of data for remote sensing the Earth or other
objects. Also computer problems with these very time demanding
methods  can  interesting  including visualization, paralel
computing etc.

RELEASE:  94-157

INVESTIGATION PANEL RELEASES REPORT ON NOAA-13 FAILURE

     The probable cause of the failure of the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration-13 (NOAA-13) meteorological
satellite in August 1993 was a short circuit that prevented the
solar array current from powering the spacecraft and recharging
the batteries, according to a 12-member investigating board,
whose report was released today.

     In a 36-page report, the board indicated that the failure
most likely occurred in a battery charge assembly on the
spacecraft.  Based on telemetry from the satellite, the board
indicated the most probable cause was a 1.25-inch screw that
extended too far below an aluminum plate designed to dissipate
heat.  The screw end penetrated the insulation and made contact
with a radiator plate, causing the short circuit.

     The short circuit effectively prevented the solar arrays
from poweringthe spacecraft, forcing the spacecraft to rely on
its batteries, according to the board's findings.  Without power
from the solar arrays, the batteries could not recharge and
exhausted their power, leaving the satellite with no power
to operate its instruments or to communicate with the ground.

     "The board concluded that the design of the charge assembly
is prone to a failure of this type," said Jeremiah Madden of
NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md., who chaired
the board.  "The design requires meticulous construction
procedures, and there are many areas where a short could occur."

     The board termed the design of the battery charge assembly
"unforgiving," indicating that "it cannot be checked once it is
assembled since the heat sink cannot be removed or easily
X-rayed."

     Launched into a 540-mile (870-kilometer) near polar orbit on
an Atlas rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., on August
9, 1993, the $77 million spacecraft operated normally until
August 21.  During orbit 175, 12 minutes after the satellite's
last communication with the NOAA Command and Data Acquisition
site at Wallops, Va., the short circuit occurred, the board
found.

     When controllers communicated with the satellite and found
it operating normally on orbit 175, they followed standard
procedures and turned their attention to other operational
satellites.  Controllers did not communicate with NOAA-13 again
until orbit 177.  At that point the operations crew noted
battery low voltage and high temperature flags on all three
batteries, which were the first indications of a problem, the
board reported.

     Controllers were unable to acquire a signal from the
spacecraft on orbit 178, the board noted, and orbits 179 and 180
were not monitored because the spacecraft did not pass over
either the ground station at Wallops or the other ground station
monitoring the satellite at Fairbanks, Alaska.

     On orbit 181, satellite recovery procedures were started;
however, no further signals from the satellite were received.

     In reaching its conclusion as to probable cause, the board
looked at hardware being used to build NOAA-J, the next
spacecraft in the NOAA series, targeted for launch in December.
The team compared 12 relay mounting screws from the stock used
for NOAA-J, with dimensions of the NOAA-J relay mounting.

     The team found that 10 of the 12 screws were long enough to
penetrate into the insulation layer on NOAA-J, lending "credence
to the possibility that the failure on NOAA-13 was due to such a
screw," the board reported.

     The team reported that a "major contributor" to the failure
was the "poor packaging design" of the battery charge assembly
heat sink plate "that allows numerous places for shorts, requires
unique insulation schemes and demands tightly controlled careful
assembly."

     Another major contributor reported by the board was "poor
processing and inspection" of the charge assembly.  There was no
procedure, the board indicated, that underlined the importance of
"making sure nothing protrudes beyond the bottom of the heat
sink.  The inspection seemed to be the responsibility of the
technician that puts the unit together rather than that
of an inspection by a quality assurance engineer," the board
concluded.


     Although there was a specific manufacturing instruction to
check the box for protrusion, "the quality control plan for
building the BCX box (battery charge assembly box) was
inadequate," according to the team.  "There were not
enough checks performed on the unit as it was being built.  The
procedures were not adequate to inform the technician of the
criticality of the unit and to give him specific instructions on
how to check his work."

     The team attributed the lack of inspection partially to the
repeated successful flights of this BCX design.  "The use of
previously flown hardware tends to lessen the overview it
receives," the board suggested.  "This unit's heritage goes back
to at least 1972.  The first assembly technicians were
probably extremely careful and understood the criticality of the
design; however, in time and with personnel changing, there was
probably some loss of knowledge and awareness."

     The board made 21 recommendations for future NOAA
spacecraft, included as appendices to the report.  The
recommendations included a thorough review of and modification to
elements of the spacecraft's power system, closer monitoring of
work in process by experienced personnel, modification of the
heat sink in the battery charge assembly and improvements in some
of the spacecraft's software.

     Among the specific points the board made were
recommendationsfor high-voltage tests to verify the insulation
and the incorporation of software that would reduce power
consumption if on-board computers were to detect low
battery charges.  All of the board's recommendations regarding
the NOAA spacecraft are being implemented by the project office.

     The failure team also recommended that NOAA upgrade its
ground stations so that health and safety telemetry may be taken
from operational satellites during every orbit.  NOAA officials
have committed to adopting all of the board's recommendations as
soon as practicable, said Gary Davis, Deputy Director of
Satellite Operations for NOAA.

     To correct the NOAA-13 deficiencies on the NOAA-J
spacecraft, modifications in the area where the failure most
probably occurred have been made, according to Charles Thienel,
Associate Director of Flight Projects for Meteorological
Satellites at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.

     The modifications addressed all of the potential failure
causes mentioned in the report.  Most importantly, the radiator
plate in the charge assembly is no longer "hot," or carrying
electric current.  Even if a screw were to touch the plate, as
may have happened on NOAA-13, there would be no short circuit.

     Moreover, he said, additional inspections and tests were
implemented on NOAA-J.  The project team also has developed
flight software that will allow ground controllers more time to
deal with a power-system problem by isolating a short circuit,
effectively removing the affected subsystem from the spacecraft's
power system.

     Also, Thienel explained, an exhaustive review was undertaken
on NOAA-J by an independent team to look carefully at every
spacecraft system and subsystem.  The review will verify that all
inspections and tests were carried out to demonstrate compliance
with the mission requirements.

     The NOAA prime contractor and builder, Martin Marietta Astro
Space, East Windsor, N.J., in addition to making the specific
changes recommended by the NOAA-13 board, has undertaken
intensive reviews of the design, manufacture and testing of every
satellite it is building.  For NASA, these satellites include the
Landsat 7 and EOS-AM1 Earth-observing spacecraft and the Wind and
Polar space science missions.

     Failure team members were Jeremiah J. Madden, Associate
Director of Flight Projects, Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC),
Chairman; James Murphy, Flight Projects Directorate (GSFC),
Recording Secretary; H. Richard Freeman, Chief Engineer,
Engineering Directorate (GSFC); John Pandelides and Donald
Lokerson, Flight Projects Directorate (GSFC); Edward Gaddy,
Engineering Directorate (GSFC); Alfred L. Seivold, Flight
Assurance Directorate (GSFC); Thomas E. McGunigal, Systems
Acquisition Office, NOAA; Gary Davis, National Environmental
Satellite, Data and Information Service, NOAA; James Greaves,
Office of Mission to Planet Earth, NASA Headquarters; Michael
Greenfield, NASA Headquarters and William J. Middendorf, NASA
Lewis Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio.

     F. John Solman III and Angelo Colao, of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, Mass., served as
consultants to the board, and Josef Wonsever, NASA Headquarters,
David Coolidge, Flight Projects Directorate  (GSFC), and Wilfred
Mazur, NOAA, served as advisors to the panel.

     NOAA's polar-orbiting satellite program is a cooperative
effort with NASA.  The space agency's Goddard Space Flight Center
develops and procures the spacecraft before turning them over to
NOAA for operations.  Copies of the NOAA-13 failure report are
available in the newsrooms at NASA Headquarters, Goddard Space
Flight Center, Johnson Space Center and Kennedy Space Center.

Awhile ago there was a post from Enrico Falconelli <aef@p90.msoft.it> about 
software and a pc ISA board for decoding NOAA Polar Orbiting weather satellite 
data.  It was for HRPT (digital) not the easier APT(analog) data.

I sent away for the kit.  For US$200 I received a well designed pcb kit with a 
few key components ( the other components are easily available ).  The kit 
went together very well and can be tuned up using an oscilliscope and freq 
counter.  (I had accesss to a spectrum analyser which we used but may not be 
necessary). The board went into an ISA slot and the software was DOS.  The 
receiver I used was an ICOM R-100 other radios can be used but amplification 
of their 10.7 IF output would be necessary e.g. ICOM R-7000.

It was a lot of fun building the kit.  The reception if HRPT is not easy but 
this kit does remove one of the obsticles.  For the antenna we used a 4' dish, 
feedhorn and preamp for SWAGUR Enterprises http://www.execpc.com/~swagur

RELEASE:  95-82

AGENCIES ESTABLISH NEW CIVIL-MILITARY SATELLITE PROGRAM

     The Clinton Administration has taken a major step 
toward combining the country's military and civilian weather 
satellite programs into a single system -- a move that is 
expected to save American taxpayers up to $300 million 
through 1999, with additional savings through the life of 
the program.

      Secretary of Commerce Ronald H. Brown, Secretary of 
Defense William J. Perry, and NASA Administrator Daniel S. 
Goldin signed a formal agreement on May 26, establishing the 
agencies' roles and responsibilities in support of the new 
system and implementing a Presidential Decision Directive 
that was signed last year. 

     "Combining these programs was a key recommendation of 
Vice President Gore's National Performance Review," said 
Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere, D. 
James Baker.  "The new program will result in a major 
reduction of acquisition, operational and facilities costs." 

     Currently four U.S. polar-orbiting satellites are used 
to collect operational, meteorological, oceanographic, 
climatic and space environment data.  Two satellites are 
provided and operated by the Department of Commerce's 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and 
two by the Department of Defense's Defense Meteorological 
Satellite Program.  The new combined program will consist of 
three satellites.  The first satellite under the new system, 
called the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental 
Satellite System (NPOESS), is expected to be launched in 2006.

     To acquire and operate the NPOESS, the Department of 
Defense, NASA and NOAA have established an Integrated 
Program Office.  James T. Mannen, a retired Air Force 
Colonel with extensive experience in space programs, was 
named director of the office on May 30.

     The signing of the agreement by the three agencies 
represents a tangible and significant step forward in 
interagency cooperation -- merging operational military and 
civilian systems, while still satisfying each agency's 
critical mission requirements and doing so at reduced cost 
to American taxpayers.

Please send your organization's acronyms to wollman@emba.uvm.edu!
=====

This message is periodically posted to the newsgroup sci.space in an
effort to make NASAspeak understandable to the general reader.  The
primary purpose is a repository for space-related acronyms; however, I
reserve the right to make non-acronymic entries at any time.  Just the
same, this document does not attempt to cover any issues in-depth; for
more information, you will probably want to read the FAQ, posted by
Jon Leech of UNC, which also comes out about once a month.

The title of this posting comes from an April-fools' spoof of Peter
Yee's ``NASA Headline News'' postings; I believe that this is in the
archive at Ames.  As it turns out, the title given there is not
exactly as I had remembered it, but I will keep this title as is.

Many of the descriptions here are from the NASA Mixed Fleet Manifest
dated February 1991.  Others are blatantly stolen from Mark Bradford's
acronym posting, which is somewhat shorter; these entries are marked
with a splat (`*').  His posting has a somewhat different scope than
mine; he also includes material intended more towards sci.astro,
whereas I have chosen to exclude this material.  If there is enough
demand, I might add some.  Still others (some questionable ones are
marked [EOS]) are from Hughes' booklet ``EOSDIS Abbreviations and
Acronym List''; some of these may not exist, and some may never exist
ever.  But remember, you saw it here first.

If anyone can elaborate (up to about three lines) on any of the
one-line entries posted here, please send me that information.  Just
because I wrote down the expansion doesn't mean that I have the
slightest idea what it's for (unless I have already elaborated on it).

Thanks to the following other individuals who made a contribution to
this posting: Kelly Beatty, J. Bessant, Eric Borm, Daniel Fischer,
Christopher Graham, Ron Graham, Sean Graves, Sam Ho, Ken Hollis, Jost
Jahn, Ken Jenks, Ralf Kloth, G. W. Leppelmeier, John Limpert, Mark
Maimone, Richard Murphy, Perry Ramsey, John Roberts, Mike Salmon, Jeff
Scrutton, Bob Schaefer, Rob Seaman, Mary Shafer, Allen Sherzer, Glenn
Stone, Camille Trentacoste, Benoit Turgeon, Christopher Warack,
Stephen Watson, and Richard Wolff; this includes people who have
posted articles in sci.space or space-tech.  Special thanks to
Jonathan McDowell and to Peter Yee.

This document is archived in the following places:
	o The SPACE archives at NASA Ames
(ames.arc.nasa.gov:~ftp/pub/SPACE/MISC/acronyms-MonthYR.txt).
	o The USENET FAQ archives at pit-manager.mit.edu (in
/pub/usenet/sci.space and by Prospero under
/archive-sites/pit-manager.mit.edu/pub/usenet/sci.space) 

Thanks to Jonathan Kamens for the archive.  I'm trying to get WAIS
running here at UVM; watch this space for details.

A Three-Letter Acronym (TLA) is defined as follows (from The Jargon
File 2.9.1, edited by Eric S. Raymond):

TLA: /T-L-A/ [Three-Letter Acronym] n. 1. Self-describing
   acronym for a species with which computing terminology is infested.
   2. Any confusing acronym at all.  Examples include MCA, FTP, SNA,
   CPU, MMU, SCCS, DMU, FPU, TLA, NNTP.  People who like this looser
   usage argue that not all TLAs have three letters, just as not all
   four-letter words have four letters.  One also hears of `ETLA'
   (Extended Three Letter Acronym, pronounced /ee tee el ay/) being
   used to describe four-letter acronyms.  The term `SFLA' (Stupid
   Four-Letter Acronym) has also been reported.  See also {YABA}.

   The self-effacing phrase "TDM TLA" (Too Damn Many...) is often
   used to bemoan the plethora of TLAs in use.  In 1989, a random of
   the journalistic persuasion asked hacker Paul Boutin "What do you
   think will be the biggest problem in computing in the 90s?"
   Paul's straight-faced response: "There are only seventeen thousand
   3-letter acronyms." (Actually, there are 26^3 = 17,576)

                  Kok.
                  Main objective of IMIX is to build low cost image processing
                  solutions (software and hardware) for industry and institutes.

                  Main market of IMIX:

                  o     Production factories:
                        o quality control  o detection
                        o process control  o measurement

                  o     Research institutes:
                        o image analysis   o data reduction
                        o Remote Sensing   o education

                  Relevant experience gathered during the IMIX period:
                  o     Extensive knowledge of the C language, shell scripts and
                        the Unix operating system.
                  o     Programming user interfaces in XWindows.
                  o     Installation and maintenance of many Public Domain (PD)
                        software packages, for example:
                        o     Postgres, a database management system from the
                              University of California. This was used to reach a
                              systematic approach of image processing using the
                              embedded query language of postgres (PostQuel)
                        o     Khoros, the extensive image processing package
                              from the University of New Mexico
                  o     Development and teaching of the course "Computer
                        Vision" at the Hogeschool Utrecht (pyrotechnical school) at
                        the division Industrial Automation and Computer Integrated
                        Manufacturing.
                        Writing of lecture notes for this course.
                  o     Maintenance and programming a Sun SparcStation 1+ with
                        VideoPix frame grabber board.
                  o     Consultancy to the ITC's Image Processing Laboratory
                        (IPL) for the production of satellite images, software
                        development and retrieving and maintenance of software
                        packages.

                        Production is: retrieving data, making subsets, hardcopies,
                        doing early stage processing, filtering, classification etc.

                        Production shifted from the old PDP's to the modern HP
                        workstations, making efficient use of available hardware
                        resources and the network.
                        The Erdas image file format was adapted as the standard
                        image format for programs.

                        Numerous packages were collected from the Internet and
                        adapted for IPL. These programs help to speed up
                        production and increase the capabilities of the IPL.

                        Used Hardware & Software at the ITC:
                        o     HP 9000/720 + HP-UX 9

<h2>LISTSERV and discussion lists via e-mail only</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="mailto:wxsat-request@ssg.com">WXSAT-L</a>
<br>This list serves two functions.  The primary function is
the distribution of NOAA status and prediction bulletins for the
GOES and polar weather satellites.  This data is the same data
available via SCIENCEnet NOAA.SAT bulletin board area.  The mail
list also acts as a reflector for subscribers' comments and
discussion of matters related to weather satellites, ground
stations, and associated topics.

<li><a href="mailto:listserv@CSEARN.BITNET">IMAGRS-L</a>@CSEARN.BITNET (or IMAGRS-L@EARN.CVUT.CZ)
<br>Digital Image Processing of Remotely Sensed Data
<p>
The area of digital image processing of remotelly sensed data
should be the main topic of this club - so exactly the problems of
the interest  are the  methods  of  digital  image  processing  for
remotelly sensed data (like LANDSAT or SPOT) as well as microwave
and also new types of data for remote sensing the Earth or other
objects. Also computer problems with these very time demanding
methods  can  interesting  including visualization, paralel
computing etc.

                 ********  Disclaimer  ********

The EROS Data Center has provided LAS to outside users for over
12 years and has provided limited support.  The LAS, ADAPS, XID,
and TIEPTS systems have been developed to support research and
development of image processing applications within NASA and the
USGS. Since the software is public-domain, it is available to any
government or private institution.

As the popularity of these systems has grown, so has the impact
of external support on EDC resources.  This impact has greatly
hampered the continued development of EDC's internal image
processing capabilities.  As a result, EDC can no longer provide
external support.  Occasionally, limited support will be considered
for agencies with whom we have cooperative agreements or mutual goals.

All requests for copies of these software packages must be made
formally and should state that you have read and understand this
disclaimer.  Requests should be mailed or faxed to:

RELEASE:  94-157

INVESTIGATION PANEL RELEASES REPORT ON NOAA-13 FAILURE

     The probable cause of the failure of the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration-13 (NOAA-13) meteorological
satellite in August 1993 was a short circuit that prevented the
solar array current from powering the spacecraft and recharging
the batteries, according to a 12-member investigating board,
whose report was released today.

     In a 36-page report, the board indicated that the failure
most likely occurred in a battery charge assembly on the
spacecraft.  Based on telemetry from the satellite, the board
indicated the most probable cause was a 1.25-inch screw that
extended too far below an aluminum plate designed to dissipate
heat.  The screw end penetrated the insulation and made contact
with a radiator plate, causing the short circuit.

     The short circuit effectively prevented the solar arrays
from poweringthe spacecraft, forcing the spacecraft to rely on
its batteries, according to the board's findings.  Without power
from the solar arrays, the batteries could not recharge and
exhausted their power, leaving the satellite with no power
to operate its instruments or to communicate with the ground.

     "The board concluded that the design of the charge assembly
is prone to a failure of this type," said Jeremiah Madden of
NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md., who chaired
the board.  "The design requires meticulous construction
procedures, and there are many areas where a short could occur."

     The board termed the design of the battery charge assembly
"unforgiving," indicating that "it cannot be checked once it is
assembled since the heat sink cannot be removed or easily
X-rayed."

     Launched into a 540-mile (870-kilometer) near polar orbit on
an Atlas rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif., on August
9, 1993, the $77 million spacecraft operated normally until
August 21.  During orbit 175, 12 minutes after the satellite's
last communication with the NOAA Command and Data Acquisition
site at Wallops, Va., the short circuit occurred, the board
found.

     When controllers communicated with the satellite and found
it operating normally on orbit 175, they followed standard
procedures and turned their attention to other operational
satellites.  Controllers did not communicate with NOAA-13 again
until orbit 177.  At that point the operations crew noted
battery low voltage and high temperature flags on all three
batteries, which were the first indications of a problem, the
board reported.

     Controllers were unable to acquire a signal from the
spacecraft on orbit 178, the board noted, and orbits 179 and 180
were not monitored because the spacecraft did not pass over
either the ground station at Wallops or the other ground station
monitoring the satellite at Fairbanks, Alaska.

     On orbit 181, satellite recovery procedures were started;
however, no further signals from the satellite were received.

     In reaching its conclusion as to probable cause, the board
looked at hardware being used to build NOAA-J, the next
spacecraft in the NOAA series, targeted for launch in December.
The team compared 12 relay mounting screws from the stock used
for NOAA-J, with dimensions of the NOAA-J relay mounting.

     The team found that 10 of the 12 screws were long enough to
penetrate into the insulation layer on NOAA-J, lending "credence
to the possibility that the failure on NOAA-13 was due to such a
screw," the board reported.

     The team reported that a "major contributor" to the failure
was the "poor packaging design" of the battery charge assembly
heat sink plate "that allows numerous places for shorts, requires
unique insulation schemes and demands tightly controlled careful
assembly."

     Another major contributor reported by the board was "poor
processing and inspection" of the charge assembly.  There was no
procedure, the board indicated, that underlined the importance of
"making sure nothing protrudes beyond the bottom of the heat
sink.  The inspection seemed to be the responsibility of the
technician that puts the unit together rather than that
of an inspection by a quality assurance engineer," the board
concluded.


     Although there was a specific manufacturing instruction to
check the box for protrusion, "the quality control plan for
building the BCX box (battery charge assembly box) was
inadequate," according to the team.  "There were not
enough checks performed on the unit as it was being built.  The
procedures were not adequate to inform the technician of the
criticality of the unit and to give him specific instructions on
how to check his work."

     The team attributed the lack of inspection partially to the
repeated successful flights of this BCX design.  "The use of
previously flown hardware tends to lessen the overview it
receives," the board suggested.  "This unit's heritage goes back
to at least 1972.  The first assembly technicians were
probably extremely careful and understood the criticality of the
design; however, in time and with personnel changing, there was
probably some loss of knowledge and awareness."

     The board made 21 recommendations for future NOAA
spacecraft, included as appendices to the report.  The
recommendations included a thorough review of and modification to
elements of the spacecraft's power system, closer monitoring of
work in process by experienced personnel, modification of the
heat sink in the battery charge assembly and improvements in some
of the spacecraft's software.

     Among the specific points the board made were
recommendationsfor high-voltage tests to verify the insulation
and the incorporation of software that would reduce power
consumption if on-board computers were to detect low
battery charges.  All of the board's recommendations regarding
the NOAA spacecraft are being implemented by the project office.

     The failure team also recommended that NOAA upgrade its
ground stations so that health and safety telemetry may be taken
from operational satellites during every orbit.  NOAA officials
have committed to adopting all of the board's recommendations as
soon as practicable, said Gary Davis, Deputy Director of
Satellite Operations for NOAA.

     To correct the NOAA-13 deficiencies on the NOAA-J
spacecraft, modifications in the area where the failure most
probably occurred have been made, according to Charles Thienel,
Associate Director of Flight Projects for Meteorological
Satellites at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.

     The modifications addressed all of the potential failure
causes mentioned in the report.  Most importantly, the radiator
plate in the charge assembly is no longer "hot," or carrying
electric current.  Even if a screw were to touch the plate, as
may have happened on NOAA-13, there would be no short circuit.

     Moreover, he said, additional inspections and tests were
implemented on NOAA-J.  The project team also has developed
flight software that will allow ground controllers more time to
deal with a power-system problem by isolating a short circuit,
effectively removing the affected subsystem from the spacecraft's
power system.

     Also, Thienel explained, an exhaustive review was undertaken
on NOAA-J by an independent team to look carefully at every
spacecraft system and subsystem.  The review will verify that all
inspections and tests were carried out to demonstrate compliance
with the mission requirements.

     The NOAA prime contractor and builder, Martin Marietta Astro
Space, East Windsor, N.J., in addition to making the specific
changes recommended by the NOAA-13 board, has undertaken
intensive reviews of the design, manufacture and testing of every
satellite it is building.  For NASA, these satellites include the
Landsat 7 and EOS-AM1 Earth-observing spacecraft and the Wind and
Polar space science missions.

     Failure team members were Jeremiah J. Madden, Associate
Director of Flight Projects, Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC),
Chairman; James Murphy, Flight Projects Directorate (GSFC),
Recording Secretary; H. Richard Freeman, Chief Engineer,
Engineering Directorate (GSFC); John Pandelides and Donald
Lokerson, Flight Projects Directorate (GSFC); Edward Gaddy,
Engineering Directorate (GSFC); Alfred L. Seivold, Flight
Assurance Directorate (GSFC); Thomas E. McGunigal, Systems
Acquisition Office, NOAA; Gary Davis, National Environmental
Satellite, Data and Information Service, NOAA; James Greaves,
Office of Mission to Planet Earth, NASA Headquarters; Michael
Greenfield, NASA Headquarters and William J. Middendorf, NASA
Lewis Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio.

     F. John Solman III and Angelo Colao, of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT), Cambridge, Mass., served as
consultants to the board, and Josef Wonsever, NASA Headquarters,
David Coolidge, Flight Projects Directorate  (GSFC), and Wilfred
Mazur, NOAA, served as advisors to the panel.

     NOAA's polar-orbiting satellite program is a cooperative
effort with NASA.  The space agency's Goddard Space Flight Center
develops and procures the spacecraft before turning them over to
NOAA for operations.  Copies of the NOAA-13 failure report are

Awhile ago there was a post from Enrico Falconelli <aef@p90.msoft.it> about 
software and a pc ISA board for decoding NOAA Polar Orbiting weather satellite 
data.  It was for HRPT (digital) not the easier APT(analog) data.

I sent away for the kit.  For US$200 I received a well designed pcb kit with a 
few key components ( the other components are easily available ).  The kit 
went together very well and can be tuned up using an oscilliscope and freq 
counter.  (I had accesss to a spectrum analyser which we used but may not be 
necessary). The board went into an ISA slot and the software was DOS.  The 
receiver I used was an ICOM R-100 other radios can be used but amplification 
of their 10.7 IF output would be necessary e.g. ICOM R-7000.

It was a lot of fun building the kit.  The reception if HRPT is not easy but 
this kit does remove one of the obsticles.  For the antenna we used a 4' dish, 
feedhorn and preamp for SWAGUR Enterprises http://www.execpc.com/~swagur

RELEASE:  95-82

AGENCIES ESTABLISH NEW CIVIL-MILITARY SATELLITE PROGRAM

     The Clinton Administration has taken a major step 
toward combining the country's military and civilian weather 
satellite programs into a single system -- a move that is 
expected to save American taxpayers up to $300 million 
through 1999, with additional savings through the life of 
the program.

      Secretary of Commerce Ronald H. Brown, Secretary of 
Defense William J. Perry, and NASA Administrator Daniel S. 
Goldin signed a formal agreement on May 26, establishing the 
agencies' roles and responsibilities in support of the new 
system and implementing a Presidential Decision Directive 
that was signed last year. 

     "Combining these programs was a key recommendation of 
Vice President Gore's National Performance Review," said 
Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere, D. 
James Baker.  "The new program will result in a major 
reduction of acquisition, operational and facilities costs." 

     Currently four U.S. polar-orbiting satellites are used 
to collect operational, meteorological, oceanographic, 
climatic and space environment data.  Two satellites are 
provided and operated by the Department of Commerce's 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and 
two by the Department of Defense's Defense Meteorological 
Satellite Program.  The new combined program will consist of 
three satellites.  The first satellite under the new system, 
called the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental 
Satellite System (NPOESS), is expected to be launched in 2006.

     To acquire and operate the NPOESS, the Department of 
Defense, NASA and NOAA have established an Integrated 
Program Office.  James T. Mannen, a retired Air Force 
Colonel with extensive experience in space programs, was 
named director of the office on May 30.

     The signing of the agreement by the three agencies 
represents a tangible and significant step forward in 
interagency cooperation -- merging operational military and 
civilian systems, while still satisfying each agency's 
critical mission requirements and doing so at reduced cost 
to American taxpayers.

<title>NASA Acronyms</title>

=====
Please send your organization's acronyms to wollman@emba.uvm.edu!
=====

This message is periodically posted to the newsgroup sci.space in an
effort to make NASAspeak understandable to the general reader.  The
primary purpose is a repository for space-related acronyms; however, I
reserve the right to make non-acronymic entries at any time.  Just the
same, this document does not attempt to cover any issues in-depth; for
more information, you will probably want to read the FAQ, posted by
Jon Leech of UNC, which also comes out about once a month.

The title of this posting comes from an April-fools' spoof of Peter
Yee's ``NASA Headline News'' postings; I believe that this is in the
archive at Ames.  As it turns out, the title given there is not
exactly as I had remembered it, but I will keep this title as is.

Many of the descriptions here are from the NASA Mixed Fleet Manifest
dated February 1991.  Others are blatantly stolen from Mark Bradford's
acronym posting, which is somewhat shorter; these entries are marked
with a splat (`*').  His posting has a somewhat different scope than
mine; he also includes material intended more towards sci.astro,
whereas I have chosen to exclude this material.  If there is enough
demand, I might add some.  Still others (some questionable ones are
marked [EOS]) are from Hughes' booklet ``EOSDIS Abbreviations and
Acronym List''; some of these may not exist, and some may never exist
ever.  But remember, you saw it here first.

If anyone can elaborate (up to about three lines) on any of the
one-line entries posted here, please send me that information.  Just
because I wrote down the expansion doesn't mean that I have the
slightest idea what it's for (unless I have already elaborated on it).

Thanks to the following other individuals who made a contribution to
this posting: Kelly Beatty, J. Bessant, Eric Borm, Daniel Fischer,
Christopher Graham, Ron Graham, Sean Graves, Sam Ho, Ken Hollis, Jost
Jahn, Ken Jenks, Ralf Kloth, G. W. Leppelmeier, John Limpert, Mark
Maimone, Richard Murphy, Perry Ramsey, John Roberts, Mike Salmon, Jeff
Scrutton, Bob Schaefer, Rob Seaman, Mary Shafer, Allen Sherzer, Glenn
Stone, Camille Trentacoste, Benoit Turgeon, Christopher Warack,
Stephen Watson, and Richard Wolff; this includes people who have
posted articles in sci.space or space-tech.  Special thanks to
Jonathan McDowell and to Peter Yee.

This document is archived in the following places:
	o The SPACE archives at NASA Ames
(ames.arc.nasa.gov:~ftp/pub/SPACE/MISC/acronyms-MonthYR.txt).
	o The USENET FAQ archives at pit-manager.mit.edu (in
/pub/usenet/sci.space and by Prospero under
/archive-sites/pit-manager.mit.edu/pub/usenet/sci.space) 

Thanks to Jonathan Kamens for the archive.  I'm trying to get WAIS
running here at UVM; watch this space for details.

A Three-Letter Acronym (TLA) is defined as follows (from The Jargon
File 2.9.1, edited by Eric S. Raymond):

TLA: /T-L-A/ [Three-Letter Acronym] n. 1. Self-describing
   acronym for a species with which computing terminology is infested.
   2. Any confusing acronym at all.  Examples include MCA, FTP, SNA,
   CPU, MMU, SCCS, DMU, FPU, TLA, NNTP.  People who like this looser
   usage argue that not all TLAs have three letters, just as not all
   four-letter words have four letters.  One also hears of `ETLA'
   (Extended Three Letter Acronym, pronounced /ee tee el ay/) being
   used to describe four-letter acronyms.  The term `SFLA' (Stupid
   Four-Letter Acronym) has also been reported.  See also {YABA}.

   The self-effacing phrase "TDM TLA" (Too Damn Many...) is often
   used to bemoan the plethora of TLAs in use.  In 1989, a random of
   the journalistic persuasion asked hacker Paul Boutin "What do you
   think will be the biggest problem in computing in the 90s?"
   Paul's straight-faced response: "There are only seventeen thousand
   3-letter acronyms." (Actually, there are 26^3 = 17,576)

<h1>Preface</h1>
This report was conducted under contract of the BCRS (BeleidsCommissie
Remote Sensing, or the Dutch Coordination Committee for Remote Sensing).
It is part of the Alexander project. Alexander is the educational Image
Processing package for Remotely Sensed images developed by the ITC.
Originally it was developed for the Archimedes (by Acorn) computers.
Currently there is also a port for PCs. The PC version was implemented
by a Dutch company called CSL.
<p>
One of the workpackages of the project comprises the creation of a CD-ROM containing
example data sets that could be used in exercises within Alexander. It was
soon discovered that RS data is expensive and copyright issues are tricky.
So instead the workpackage was changed to making a report on RS data sets
readily available.
<p>
This reports describes
<ul>
<li>the most common satellite platforms
<li>the CD-ROM family
<li>the Kodak Photo CD
<li>available data sets
<li>addresses of organizations that supply these data sets
<li>etc. etc...
</ul>
All in all it contains a wealth of information on the field of Remote Sensing
and GIS.

<H1>Introduction</H1>

At the start of the BCRS project Alexander: "A computer interactive learning package
for applications of Remote Sensing and Geo-Information Systems (RS & GIS)" the
project team was optimistic about the availability of both CD-ROM hardware, software
and applications. However, suitable standards were slow in coming and not generally
applicable. Potential users were slow in buying. And RS data sellers were raising their
prices even for data intended for the educational data. A half year before the end of
the project it was decided to spend more time on investigating the emerging
standards and markets and to delay the production of a sample disc until the
occasion of a specific request of a buyer.
<P>
Considering the data - in the case of GIS - "vector" data are already supported via
public domain maps on floppy disc or other media. And, increasingly, scanned raster
maps with one form or other of data compression become available or can be
generated on request.
In the case of Remote Sensing data the most important data are digitized
photographs. The analog to digital conversion can be done locally with 800 dpi to
1000 dpi scanners and the Kodak PhotoCD (Professional) offers interesting
possibilities.
However the availability of other Remote Sensing data is not as widespread and cost
effective as had been hoped for.
<P>
Therefor this report concentrates on available types of Remote Sensing data and
present options for storing on and retrieving data from CD-ROM under a wide variety
of formats.

<H1>The Image Atlas</H1>


An image atlas is a collection of marvellous images. These images are not just
beautiful to look at: they also can be used for a diversity of applications in daily life.
With these images floods can be predicted or icebergs detected. With these images
a geologist can discriminate details which lead him to underground water-stores and
new deposits of mineral resources. With these images maps can be made of the
vegetation in large areas.
Many more applications are possible, <A href="#table 1">table 1</A> lists just a few.
<P>
Examining the earth from space looks like a wonderful means. Most of the scientists
are enthusiastic. Some scientist air their criticism and refuse to see the potential
these images can offer. The best way is to see for yourself and judge if these images
offer anything else besides just beauty. And to try and recognize and understand the
many details these images show; possibly aided by proven Image Processing and
GIS techniques.
<P>
In order to give maximum flexibility for selecting images for exercises a good Image
Atlas should cover a number of examples from the following items:
<UL>
     <LI><A href="table3.html">Types of Satellites</A> (Platforms)
     <LI><A href="table3.html">Types of Sensors</A> (spatial, temporal and spectral resolution)
     <LI>Digitized Aerial Photographs
     <LI><A href="#table 2">Regions of the World</A>
     <LI><A href="#table 1">Application Areas</A>
</UL>
This way the designer
of exercises has the maximum degree of freedom to design exercises and the trainee
can pick an image matching his own interest.
<P>
For more GIS based applications it might be useful to add the following items:
<UL>
     <LI>Vector maps
     <LI>Digital Elevation Models
</UL>
These can aid the interpretation of a satellite image.
<P>
The next chapter goes into more detail about some Platforms and their sensors.
Chapter 3 gives a description of the New Media: the CD-ROM. Chapter 4 describes
the latest descendant of the CD-ROM family: the Kodak Photo CD. A manual of the
Freeware program hpcdtoppm - it can convert the Kodak PCD image format - can be
found in appendix G. Appendix F lists some commonly used CD-ROM Drives and
Recorders. The other appendices list a large number of Institutes, Organizations,
Companies and Persons that supply data on CD-ROM.

<H1>Satellite Platforms and their Sensors</H1>

<H2>Sensors</H2>

A major characteristic of an image in Remote Sensing is the wavelength band it
represents. Some images are measurements of the spatial disposition of reflected
solar radiation in the ultraviolet, visible and near-to-middle infrared range of
wavelengths. Others are measurements of the spatial distribution of energy emitted
by the earth itself (dominant in the so-called thermal infrared wavelength range); yet
others, particularly in the microwave band of wavelengths, measure the relative return
from the earth's surface of energy actually transmitted from the vehicle itself. Systems
of this last type are referred to as active since the energy source is provided by the
Remote Sensing platform; by comparison Remote Sensing measurements that
depends upon an external energy source, such as the sun, are called passive.
Together with the frame size of an image, in equivalent ground kilometres, the
number of spectral bands, radiometric resolution, temporal resolution and spatial
resolution determine the data volume provided by a particular sensor and thus
establish the amount of data to be processed. As an illustration consider the Landsat
Thematic Mapper instrument. It has 7 wavelength bands with 8 bit radiometric
resolution, which have 30m spatial resolution. [Band 6 of TM - the thermal band - is in fact
lower in radiometric as well as spatial resolution, 7 bits and 120m, but is usually supplied in the same -
 resampled - sample size as the other bands]. An image frame of 185 km x 185 km therefore
represents approximately 270 Mbytes of digital image data.

<H2>Weather Satellite Sensors</H2>

Weather Satellites and those used for earth resources sensing operate in much the
same bands of wavelength. Perhaps the major distinction in the image data they
provide lies in the temporal and spatial resolution available. Whereas data acquired
for earth resources purposes generally has pixels** that represent samples** which
cover an area on the earth of less than 100 meter by 100 meter, that used for
meteorological applications usually has much coarser samples - often of the order of
1 km x 1 km or even 5 km x 5 km. Having made this distinction however it is
important to note that because of similarity in wavebands, meteorological satellite
data such as that from the <a name="noaa"><strong>NOAA</strong></a> Advanced Very High Resolution** Radiometer
(AVHRR) does find application in Remote Sensing when large synoptic views are
required. The temporal resolution (time interval between samples of the same location
on earth) of weather satellites is high. <a name="meteosat"><strong>Meteosat</strong></a> 30 minutes, NOAA 11+12
approximately every 2 hours, SPOT 26 days, Landsat 16 days.
<P>
[** Please note that a pixel is the representation of a sample of the real world. As such it doesn't have
a size of its own, but often the term pixelsize is loosely used for the size of the sample of a certain
pixel. Resolution is defined as the smallest distance between objects before they become
indistinguishable. Resolution is not necessarily the same as the sample size! Furthermore note that
the sample size and resolution can be used for spatial as well as temporal, spectral and radiometric
measurements. So although the NOAA satellite in fact has a LOW spatial resolution scanner (1.1km)
it has a Very High temporal, spectral and radiometric Resolution scanner. Radiometric resolution is the
number of significant greylevels of the sensor; often 8 bit (256 levels). NOAA gives 10 bit (1024).]
<H2>Earth Resource Satellite Sensors</H2>
The <A name="landsat"><STRONG>LANDSAT</STRONG><A> earth resources satellite system was the first designed to provide near
global coverage of the earths's surface on a regular and predictable basis.
Consequently it has been the "workhorse" image data acquisition system for Remote
Sensing purposes and has become the benchmark against which newer systems are
judged. The first three Landsats have identical orbit characteristics. The orbits are
near polar and sun synchronous - i.e., the orbital plane precesses about the earth at
the same rate that the sun seems to rotate around the earth. In this manner data is
acquired at about the same local time on every pass. All Landsat satellites acquire
image data nominally at 9:30 AM local "sun" time on a descending (North to South)
path. Fourteen orbits are covered each day, and the fifteenth, at the start of the next
day, is 159 km advanced from orbit 1, thus giving a second day coverage continuous
with that of the first day. This advance in daily coverage continues for 18 days and
then repeats. Consequently complete coverage of the earth's surface is given, with
251 revolutions in 18 days.
<P>
Three Imaging instruments have been used with the Landsat satellites. These are the
<a href="#rbv"><EM>Return Beam Vidicon</EM></a> (RBV), the <a href="#mss"><EM>Multispectral Scanner</EM></a> (MSS) and the
<a href="#tm"><EM>Thematic Mapper</EM></a> (TM).
<P>
As the name suggests the <A name="rbv"><em>RBV</em></A>'s were essentially television camera-like instruments
that took "snapshot" images of the earth's surface along the track of the satellite.
Image frames of 185x185km were acquired each shot, repeated at 25 s intervals to
give contiguous frames in along track direction at the equivalent ground speed of the
satellite. Three RBV cameras were used on Landsat 1 and 2, distinguished by
different transmission filters that allowed three spectral bands of data to be recorded.
In Landsat 3 two RBV cameras were used; however both operated panchromatically
and were focused to record data swaths of 98 km, overlapped to give a total swath
of about 185 km. By doing so a higher (40m) spatial resolution was possible
compared to the earlier RBV system (80m).
<P>
The Multispectral Scanner or <A name="mss"><em>MSS</em></A> has been carried by all five Landsat satellites. It
is a line scanner which sweeps the ground below the satellite and builds up an image
of the earth's surface as the satellite moves along the track. Because the velocity of
the spacecraft is to high to permit the scanning of the image one line at the time, a
total of six scan lines are viewed by the sensor for each sweep of the mirror that
directs reflected light from the ground. The forward motion of the satellite is such that
the mirror is back in position to scan the next six lines after it has completed its
retrace cycle. The scanner collects data in four spectral bands. A fifth band, operating
in the thermal infrared region, was included in the MSS carried by Landsat 3.
However, very little data became available due to failure soon after launch.
<P>
The <A name="tm"><em>Thematic Mapper</em></A> is a mechanical scanning device as for the MSS, but has
improved spectral, spatial and radiometric characteristics. Seven wavelength bands
are used. Note that band 7 is out of place in the progression of wavelengths as it was
added after the initial phase at the request of the geological community. Whereas the
MSS of all Landsats scans and obtains data in one direction  only, the TM acquires
data in both scan directions again with a swath width of 185 km. Sixteen scan lines
are swept simultaneously giving a 480 m strip across the satellite path. This permits
a lower mirror scan rate compared with the MSS and thus gives a higher effective
dwell time for a given spot on the ground, making possible the higher spatial
resolution and improved dynamic range.
<P>
The French satellites <a name="spot"><strong>SPOT</strong></a> 1, 2 and 3 (Systeme Probatoire d'Observation de la
Terre), launched respectively in 1986, 1990 and 1993, carry two imaging devices
referred to as <a name="hrv"><em>HRV</em></a>'s. These instruments utilize a different technology for image
acquisition from that employed in the Landsat MSS and TM devices. Rather than
using oscillating mirrors to provide cross-track scanning during the forward motion of
the space platform, the SPOT HRV instruments consist of a linear array of charge
coupled device (CCD) detectors. These form what is commonly referred as a "push
broom" scanner. Each detector in the array scans a strip in along track direction - by
several thousand such detectors a wide swath can be imaged without the need for
mechanical scanning. Moreover, owing to the long effective dwell time this allows for
each pixel, it has a higher spatial resolution. A trade-off however is that CCD
technology was not available for wavelengths into the middle infrared range at the
time of early SPOT development. Consequently the spectral bands provided by the
HRV are not unlike those of the Landsat MSS. An interesting property of the HRV is
that it incorporates a steerable mirror to allow imaging to either side of the nadir. This
allows daily coverage for a short period along with a stereoscopic viewing capability.

<h2>Radar Remote Sensing</h2>

Remote Sensing image data in the microwave range of wavelengths is generally
gathered using the technique of side-looking radar. When used with aircraft platforms
it is more commonly called <a name="slar"><strong>SLAR</strong></a> (Side-Looking Airborne Radar). For space-borne
platforms a 20m azimuth resolution would require an antenna of 1km length, which
is clearly impracticable. Therefore when radar image data is to be acquired from
spacecraft, a modification of SLAR, referred to as Synthetic Aperture Radar or <a name="sar"><strong>SAR</strong></a>
is used. Essentially this utilizes the motion of the space vehicle, during transmission
of the ranging pulses, to give an effectively long antenna, or so-called synthetic
aperture.
<P>
The first earth observational space mission to carry a synthetic aperture imaging
radar was the <a name="seasat"><strong>Seasat</strong></a> satellite launched in June 1978. Although only short lived it
recorded about 126 million square kilometres of image data, including multiple
coverage of many regions.
<P>
A modified version of the Seasat SAR was flown as the <a name="sir-a"><strong>SIR-A</strong></a> sensor on the second
flight of <a name="shuttle"><strong>Space Shuttle</strong></a> in November of 1981. In contrast to Seasat however, in which
the data was digital, the data in SIR-A was recorded and processed optically and thus
is available only in film format. In eight hours SIR-A collected data of 10 million km2
of the Earth's surface - including many inaccessible areas, covered almost
continuously by cloud, which were imaged for the very first time. The objectives of the
mission were:
<ul>
  <li>to carry out geoscientific investigations, which required a radar system alone
     or in combination with other sensors.
  <li>to explore areas that are difficult to study using visible and thermal sensors,
     e.g. cloudy areas, dense forests.
</ul>
<P>
Like Seasat and SIR-A, <a name="sir-b"><strong>SIR-B</strong></a> operated in the L-band (23 cm) and was horizontally
polarised. However, SIR-B was designed to acquire digitally processed imagery at
selectable incidence angles between 15&#176; and 60&#176;. Topography is revealed best at low
incidence angles, with higher angles providing more information on surface
roughness. The ability to image a specific area at a variety of incidence angles would
provide an excellent means of characterising the terrain. Thus, one central objective
of the SIR-B experiment was to study the effect of different illumination geometries
on the data to allow decisions about the design of future imaging radar systems.
<P>
A feature of the later <a name="sir-c"><strong>SIR-C</strong></a> instrument due for launch in 1994 will be the use of cross
polarized returns (VH and HV) and the use of multiple wavelengths (L X and C band).
<p>
Modern radar satellites include the <a name="ers-1"><strong>ERS-1</strong></a> and <a name="jers-1"><strong>JERS-1</strong></a>. The ERS-1 carries a number
of sensors, one of which is a synthetic aperture radar intended largely for sea state
and oceanographic application but more and more  recognized as being very useful
for other applications as well. The JERS-1 carries two imaging instruments; one is an
optical sensor - called <a name="ops"><em>OPS</em></a> - with provision for stereoscopic imaging and the other
an imaging radar.
<p>
Canada intends orbiting a synthetic aperture radar satellite, to be known as <a name="radarsat"><strong>Radarsat</strong></a>
in December 1994. The data provided will be a valuable complement to that from
ERS-1 and JERS-1. Radarsat will also be able to operate in several non-standard
imaging modes, including one which will give a 510 km swath.
<p>
Airborne imaging radar systems in SLAR and SAR technologies are also available.
As with airborne multispectral scanners these offer a number of advantages over
equivalent satellite based systems including flexibility in establishing mission
parameters and proprietary rights to data. However the cost of data acquisition is also
high.

<h2>Aerial Photography and Photography from Space</h2>

Around 1839 Photography was developed by two frenchmen Niepce and Daguerre.
Already shortly after the invention cameras were taken on <strong>hot-air-balloon</strong> flights.
These first aerial photographs were meant as a curiosity, but soon the military
recognized the strategic importance. Due to this military interest a lot of effort was put
into technical improvement of the equipment. Around 1850 the french officer Lausedat
developed a special camera for topographic images. Besides airballoons also <strong>kites</strong>
and <strong>rockets</strong> were used to carry cameras. Around 1858 the french balloonist
Tournachon was the first to use aerial photographs for the production of maps. Only
small areas were covered. With the invention of the <strong>Zeppelin</strong> large areas were
systematically photographed because the Zeppelin was steerable. However, until the
coming of the <strong>aeroplane</strong>, maps were still created by surveyors. It wasn't until 1930
before producers of maps started to use aerial photographs as the very basis for their
maps. Thus it became possible to map in a short time even areas were surveyors
can't go. In 1932 the Topographische Dienst of the Netherlands started using aerial
photographs.
<p>
<a name="aerial photo">Aerial photographs</a> for the production of maps can only be taken with precision
instruments under very favourable circumstances. Only a few companies have the
men and material at their disposal to take vertical aerial photographs. The basis of
the equipment is a small yet powerful aeroplane (usually twin-engined) that can fly
a stable course at low altitudes. The camera is mounted in a hole of the hull with the
lens pointing vertically downwards. The aerographical film must be of a very high
quality and must not show any geometrical distortions during and after exposure. In
the fine grain structure of the film even very small objects remain visible.
<p>
During a photoflight there must be a good cooporation between the pilot and the
navigator/photographer. At the preparation of the flight the altitude, type of camera,
type of film and the route are determined according to the demands of the client. The
flight must be done in straight line. Beforehand these lines are drawn in a map
including information about the altitude and course. The navigator leads the flight. He
supplies the pilot with course corrections and operates the camera. The photographs
must form straight strips and overlap about 60% for stereoscopic processing at a later
stage. The camera must be kept horizontal and parallel to flying direction as much
as possible. The pilot tries to keep a constant altitude and speed and takes care to
keep the plane stable (no pitch, yaw or roll), even during course corrections.
However the weather remains the most important factor for usable photographs. The
best time of year is the period between half of February and the end of May. Because
of the higher sun not many details are lost in the shadows, and because the trees
don't have leaves yet little remains hidden underneath. Furthermore flown can be only
on days with sunny and clear weather. So only a few days per year are suited for
making aerial photographs.
<p>
First an aerial photograph must corrected and interpreted. Information not clear from
the photograph is checked in the field. Next to the aerial photography,
photogrammetry plays an important roll in the production of maps. This science
developed techniques and equipment for doing very accurate measurements in aerial
photographs. For the photogrammetric processing very precise instruments are
needed because measurements must be done at just a few hundredths of a
millimetre. For example at a scale of 1:10,000 10 cm in the terrain is equivalent to
0.01 mm on the photograph. This 0.01 mm (10 micrometer) is also the approximate
resolution of aerographic film. So, supposing the film can shown 256 shades of grey
(= 8 bit or 1 byte), the data content of a 10x10" panchromatic film is 5 billion (5*10^9!)
bits or about 600 Mb. For digital processing of photographs it is necessary to convert
the analogue photographic material to a digital form. Optical scanners can scan
photographs at 12.5 &#181;m resolution with geometric distortions (or positional placement)
being in the order of magnitude of 5 &#181;m (Optronics International Inc.). Modern
laserscanners can scan photographs at 25 &#181;m (1000 dpi) but geometric distortions
may still be quite high (one undocumented source mentions 40 &#181;m) and unacceptable
for certain photogrammetric applications.
<p>
The most important photogrammetric techniques are based on the possibility of
stereoscopically viewing two overlapping photographs. This overlapping area can be
viewed in three dimensions. Thus the height of the terrain or buildings can be
measured. Errors in altitude, course and orientation of the plane during the exposure
of the film can be corrected using photogrammetric techniques. 
<p>
During the first <a name="spacelab"><strong>Spacelab</strong></a> mission, which took place between 28 November and 8
December 1983 a cartographic investigation was undertaken, known as the "<em>Metric
Camera</em> Experiment". The camera was a standard Zeiss RMK A30/23 aerial survey
camera suitably modified to interface with the Spacelab. The objective of the
experiment was to test the mapping capability of high resolution space photography
for:
<ul>
  <li>  compiling topographic and thematic maps, at scales of 1:50,000 - 1:100,000,
     particularly in unpopulated or less developed regions of the world.
  <li>  updating and revising topographic and thematic maps.
</ul>

The <a name="metric camera"><em>Metric Camera</em></a> was built by the German Aerospace Research Establishment
(DFVLR) and German industry. It had a focal length of 305 mm and produced colour
infra-red and black and white photography in 23 x 23 cm format at an altitude of
250km. 1:820,000 scale imagery was acquired with a ground coverage of 190km x
190km per frame and a resolution of approximately 20 m. To allow stereoscopic
evaluation of the photography the images were taken with at least 60% overlap in the
flight direction. Immediately after the Shuttle had landed in California, the films were
retrieved and sent to Europe for processing. The first images were available three
days later.
<p>
Approximately 1000 photographs were taken of which 550 were on colour infra-red
film and about 450 on black and white film. In total an area of 11 million km2 was
photographed, 70% of this area was either cloud free of only partly  cloud covered
and is suitable for evaluation.
<p>
<h3>The advantages of film systems include:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>  very high spatial resolution, integrity and large area coverage
  <li>  excellent stereoscopic capability for compilation of topographic elevations and
     contours
  <li>  lack of data transmission problems
  <li>  simple ground processing
  <li>  compatibility with usual photogrammetric mensuration and basic interpretation
     equipment, which is widespread around the world
  <li>  immediately useful to mapping and resource management organisations in
     developing countries
  <li>  film as information carrier is relatively low-cost and reliable (compare a 10x10"
     film with 600Mb of computer media)
</ul>
So it is not surprising to find that aerial photography still is the "workhorse" for the
acquisition of data for many Remote Sensing and GIS applications.

<h2>Aircraft Scanners</h2>

Multispectral line scanners, similar in principle to the Landsat MSS and TM
instruments, have been available for use in civil aircraft since the late 1960's. As with
satellite image acquisition it is the forward motion of the aircraft that provides along
track scanning whereas a rotating mirror or linear detector array provides sensing in
across track direction. There are several operational features that distinguish the data
provided by aircraft scanners from that produced by satellite-borne devices. These
are of significance to the image processing task. First, the data volume can be
substantially higher. This is a result of having (1) a large number of spectral bands
available and (2) a large number of pixels produced per mission, owing to the high
spatial resolution available. Recording of the data during a mission usually requires
use of a high density digital tape recorder or a robust disc unit carried on board the
aircraft.
<p>
A second feature of importance relates to the field of view (FOV) - that is  the scan
angle either side of nadir over which data is recorded. In the case of aircraft scanning
the FOV is typically 70&#176; to 90&#176;. Such a large angle is necessary to acquire an
acceptable swath of data from aircraft altitudes. By comparison the FOV for the
Landsats 1 to 3 is 11.56&#176; while that for the Landsats 4 and 5 is slightly larger
at about 15&#176;. The consequence of the larger FOV with aircraft scanning is
that significant distortions in image geometry can occur at the edges of the scan
(relative to a vertical, downward looking photograph). Often these have to be
corrected by digital processing.
<p>
Finally, the attitude stability of an aircraft as a Remote Sensing platform is much
poorer than the stability of a satellite in orbit, particularly the Landsat 4 generation for
which the pointing accuracy is 0.01&#176; (0.2 mrad) with a stability of 10^-6&#176; 
per second (20*10^-6 mrad/s). Because of atmospheric turbulence, variation in aircraft
attitude described by pitch, roll and yaw can lead to  excessive image distortion.
Sometimes the aircraft scanner is mounted on a three axis stabilized platform to
minimize these variations. It is more common however to have the scanner fixed with
respect to the aircraft body and utilize a variable sampling window on the datastream
to compensate for aircraft roll.
<p>
Use of airborne multispectral scanners offers a number of benefits. Often the user
can select the wavebands of interest in a particular application, and small bandwidths
can be used. Also, the mission can be flown to specific user requirements concerning
time of day, bearing angle and spatial resolution, the last being established by the
aircraft height above the ground. As against these however, data acquisition from
aircraft platforms is expensive by comparison with satellite recording since aircraft
missions are generally flown for a single user and do not benefit from the volume
market and synoptic view available to satellite data.

<h2>Airborne Remote Sensing in the Netherlands</h2>

The NLR operates a Fairchild Metro II and, in co-operation with the Delft University
of Technology, a Cessna Citation II for Remote Sensing flights with three advanced
Systems: CAESAR, PHARS/PHARUS and DUTSCAT. They have been employed in
several campaigns, including international campaigns of ESA for the preparation of
future satellite missions. The sensor systems are owned by the National Remote
Sensing Board (BCRS).
<p>
The airborne optical scanner <a name="caesar"><strong>CAESAR</strong></a> (CCD Airborne Experimental Scanner for
Applications in Remote Sensing) is a multichannel optical pushbroom scanner,
operating in the visible and near infrared wavelengths CAESAR can be configured in
several wavelength modes, each mode being adapted to one of several Remote
Sensing applications, including observation of inland waters, vegetation and land in
a high spatial resolution. CAESAR can also be flown in a bidirectional mode, enabling
vegetation analysis and the generation of stereo images. Custom-made software
provides absolute radiometric calibration of the CCD array and the correction of
distortions in raw data due to aircraft motion.
<p>
<a name="phars"><strong>PHARS</strong></a> is a C-band <em>VV</em>-polarized airborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) developed
as a testbed in the Dutch <a name="pharus"><strong>PHARUS</strong></a> project, which aims at the development and
realization of a fully polarized airborne synthetic aperture C-band radar.
<p>
The Delft University of Technology Scatterometer (<a name="dutscat"><strong>DUTSCAT</strong></a>) is a six-band
microwave scatterometer system. NLR's involvement in the project concerns the on-
board data recording, the integration in NLR's research aircraft and the operation of
the equipment. The airborne character and the availability of six frequency bands in
the range from 1.2 to 17.25 GHz make DUTSCAT a unique scatterometer, useful in
the preparation of European satellite radar missions.

<h1>The CD-ROM Family Tree</h1>

It took a long time before the CD-ROM was accepted as data storage for computers.
Nowadays a lot of software and operating systems appear on CD-ROM. At the same
time new applications for the CD are developed. This spawns a confusing number of
CD-formats more or less compatible with each other.

<h3>What is a CD-ROM?</h3>

CD-ROM means "Compact Disc Read Only Memory". A CD-ROM is physically
identical to a Digital Audio Compact Disc used in a CD player, but the bits recorded
on it are interpreted as computer data instead of music. You need to buy a "CD-ROM
Drive" and attach it to your computer in order to use CD-ROMs.
<p>
A CD-ROM has several advantages over other forms of data storage, and a few
disadvantages. A CD-ROM can hold about 650 megabytes of data, the equivalent of
thousands of floppy discs. CD-ROMs are not damaged by magnetic fields or the X-
rays in airport scanners. The data on a CD-ROM can be accessed much faster than
a tape, but CD-ROMs are 10 to 20 times slower than hard discs.
<p>
You cannot write to a CD-ROM. You buy a disc with the data already recorded on it.
There are thousands of titles available.

<h3>The audio CD</h3>

Everything started in 1980 with the announcement of the audio CD. The standard
technical specification of the audio CD or Compact Disc Digital Audio (CD-DA) was
put down in the <a name="red book"><em>"Red Book"</em></a> (so called because of the color of the cover). The audio
CD contains digitized music. Every second of music is represented by 1.4 million bits.
Apart from the music the CD also contains error correction and synchronization. Thus
the CD contains three times more bits than needed for the audio alone. The CD can
contain approximately 74 minutes of music so the CD can contain billions of bits of
information. This enormous capacity makes the CD suitable for storage of computer
data.

<a name="iso 9660"><h3>ISO 9660</h3></a>

Instead of reading the data sequentially for music the computer data should be
organized in a structured way in order to guarantee a fast random access of the data.
This file system structure of the CD-ROM was published in 1985 as the "High Sierra"
specification. The name "High Sierra" was derived from a hotel where the standard
was developed. Later this specification was officially adapted, with minor
modifications, by the International Standards Organization as the ISO 9660 standard
and put down in the <a name="yellow book"><em>"Yellow Book"</em></a>.
<p>
The ISO 9660 standard is a specification for PC's and has two levels. Level one looks
like the DOS filing system. File names consist of eight characters a dot and an
extension of three characters. The only characters allowed are the alphanumeric and
the underscore. Directories, contrary to DOS, can have no extensions.
All alphabetics are in UPPER case; some software maps this to lower case. Either
the file name or the extension may be empty, but not both ("F." and ".E" are both
legal file names).
<p>
There is a "File Version Number" which can range from 1-32767, and is separated
from the extension by a semi-colon. The file version number is ignored on many
systems.
Subdirectories are allowed to nest up to eight levels deep. Level two ISO-9660 allows
longer filenames, up to 32 characters. But many of the other restrictions still apply.
Level two discs are not usable on some systems, particularly MS-DOS.
<p>
The Macintosh has its own HFS format. It is unrelated to High Sierra and ISO-9660
formats. HFS stands for Hierarchical File System which is the file system of the
Macintosh. It has specific properties like resource and data forks and long file names.
<p>
Also Commodore had its own CD format, called CDTV, for the file system of the
Amiga. It is already extinct by now.
<p>
For Unix there is the <a name="rock ridge"><em>"Rock Ridge"</em></a> extension of the ISO 9660. The Rock Ridge
extensions use some undefined fields in the ISO-9660 standard to allow full unix-like
filenames, symbolic links, and deep directories. "Rock Ridge" is named after the town
in the movie "Blazing Saddles" for no particular reason.

<h2>Multimedia</h2>

<a name="cd-i"><h3>CD-I</h3></a>

Then there's the CD-I. CD-I means "Compact Disc Interactive". It is meant to provide
a standard platform for mass consumer interactive multimedia applications. (text,
images/video, audio)
<p>
The CD-I specifications are put down in the <a name="green book"><em>"Green Book"</em></a> which not only describes
the data structure of the disc but the equipment for playing it as well.
So it is more akin to CD-DA, in that it is a full specification for both the data/code and
stand-alone playback hardware: a CD-I player has a CPU, RAM, ROM, OS, and
audio/video/(MPEG) decoders built into it. Portable players add an LCD screen and
speakers/phonejacks.
<p>
There are three books by Philips IMS and published by Addison Wesley:
<pre>
"Introducing CD-I" ISBN 0-201-62748-5
"The CD-I Production Handbook" ISBN 0-201-62750-7
"The CD-I Design Handbook" ISBN 0-201-62749-3
</pre>

<a name="cd-xa"><h3>CD-XA</h3></a>

CD-ROM/XA is an extension to the Yellow Book Standard. A track on a CD-ROM/XA
disc can contain computer data, compressed audio data, and video/picture data.
Many CD-ROM drives do not support CD-ROM/XA. CD-ROM/XA extends CD-ROM
by adding some of the CD-I disc features, such as interleaving raw audio/video and
other data.

<a name="cd-r"><h3>CD-Recordable</h3>


The <a name="orange book"><em>"Orange Book"</em></a> specifies the CD-R recordable discs.
It is subdivided into two parts. Part I defines the Magneto Optical CD-MO disc.
A CD-MO consists of optional Pre-Mastered (READ-ONLY) area and a Recordable
(re-writable) user area.
<p>
Orange Book Part II also defines a second type of CD-WO (Write Once) disk called
a "Hybrid Disc". This disc consists of a Pre-recorded Area and a Recordable Area.
The Pre-recorded area is a READ ONLY area where the information is manufactured
into the disc. (This area is written per the Red, Yellow, and Green Book
specifications, and can be played on any CD-Player.) The Recordable areas are
where additional recordings can be made in one or more sessions. Only the first
session on the disc is readable by old CD-Players; additional software will be needed
to read the additional sessions. Such a CD-player is then said to be multi-session.

<a name="cd-bridge"><h3>CD-Bridge Disc</h3></a>

The CD-Bridge Disc defines a way to add additional information in a CD-ROM / XA
track in order to allow the track to be played on a CD-I player. the result is a disc that
can be played on both a CD-I player connected to a TV set and on a CD-ROM / XA
player connected to a computer.
<p>
An example of a CD-Bridge Disc is the new Photo-CD disc. The Photo-CD disc will
be playable in CD-I players, Kodak's Photo CD players and in computers using CD-
ROM/XA drives.

<a name="pcd"><h3>The Kodak Photo CD</h3></a>

The Photo CDs will be Mode 2 Form 1 sectors per the CD-ROM / XA specifications.
The disc will be written per the Orange Book Part II "Hybrid Disc" specifications. This
will allow photographs to be written to the disc in several different sessions.
Additionally, the disc will use the CD-Bridge disc format to allow the disc to be
readable by both CD-I and CD-ROM / XA players.
<p>
The photographs written to the disc in the first session will use the ISO 9660 format.
These photographs will be readable with the existing CD-ROM / XA players
connected to a computer running new software written for the Photo CD picture
structure. Additionally, the photographs will be displayable on CD-I Players and Photo
CD Players connected to a TV set.
<p>
Photographs written to disc after the first session will be displayable on CD-I Players
and Photo CD players. New software and/or firmware will be needed to read these
additional photographs with existing CD-ROM/XA players.

<h3>Electronic Book</h3>

Another special format is the Electronic Book by Sony. It's an 8 cm disc instead of
the usual 12 cm for CD-ROM. The disc is CD-XA compatible. Sony developed a
portable player, the Data Discman, for it. (Only recently Sony also released the
MiniDisc, which is a 7 cm CD-ROM and Recordable for audio).

<a name="blue book"><h3>Blue Book</h3></a>

The <em>"Blue Book"</em> is the standard for LaserDiscs.
("Blue Book" is apocryphal. Pioneer reportedly has a pre-mastering guide that may
or may not have a blue cover, but it is not a statement of the LD standard.)

<h2>Confused?</h2>

As may be clear from the previous section the CD-ROM comes in many different
formats. It's not always clear which CD can be played in which player. The confusion
starts with the CD-XA with offsprings like the "Hybrid Disc", the "Bridge Disc" and the
"Photo CD". These, in fact, are all hybrids between the CD-ROM and the CD-I. This
way the companies are gambling on two horses: multimedia PC and multimedia TV.
Companies try to make their players compatible with all the formats. And as long as
there is no standard to cover all possibilities the confusion will last **. Fact is that only
the audio CD-DA, with additional software, can be played in any player.
<p>
     [** An attempt is made by ECMA 168. ECMA is the European Computer Manufacturers Association. ECMA 168 allows
     greater information interchange using CD-ROM for publishing applications. In addition, it supports incremental
     recording and updating of information stored on a CD-WO disc. It is extensible to support future application and
     information processing system requirements. ECMA 168 is a volume and file format standard for write-once CD and
     CD-ROM. It was approved as a European standard by the ECMA General Assembly in June of 1992. It provides for
     full Orange Book functionality, including multisession recording, track-at-once recording, and packet recording. When
     used with an Orange Book writer, this will allow write-once CD to be used more like a general-purpose storage
     peripheral than is possible using ISO 9660. ECMA 168 also incorporates the functionality of Rock Ridge: the ability
     to use Unix-style filenames, Unix permissions, and deep directory hierarchies. Much thought was put into character
     set issues, and ECMA 168 accommodates multiple-byte character sets such as ISO 10646. Although ECMA 168 is
     not upward-compatible with ISO 9660, it is possible to write a "conformant disc" containing both sets of volume and
     file structures. If such a disc is Yellow Book compatible (a CD-ROM or a CD-WO written disc-at-once), it could be read
     on either an ISO 9660 system or an ECMA 168 system. There are many common elements between ECMA 168 and
     ECMA 167, which is a new standard intended primarily for WORM and erasable optical disks. Hopefully this will
     encourage developers to support both standards.]

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

The only possible conclusion is that a CD-XA player capable of reading multi-session
CD's is the best option for your computer. Most of the discs can be read. It can read
the common ISO 9660 (High Sierra) discs as well as the Kodak Photo CDs. The
latter, of course, is a very interesting option for Image Processing. However you'll
need to buy/acquire additional software to be able to unravel the Kodak Photo CD
image format. Currently an excellent Freeware program is available that can do the
job. (see <a href="hpcdtoppm.ps">here</a> for a manual of hpcdtoppm). It converts the PCD format to a format
called Portable BitMap (PBM). Public Domain programs exist to convert PBM to
almost every known image format.

<h1>The Kodak Photo CD</h1>

<h3>Photo CD Application Background</h3>

In September 1990, Eastman Kodak Company announced a technology to allow high-
resolution 35 mm film images to be stored on compact discs and then viewed on TV.
The new Photo CD technology promised to help the so-called back end of the
photographic process catch up with advancements in the front end. Although
automatic 35 mm cameras and new film formulations had combined during the 1980s
to enable photographers to take better pictures more easily, the process of storing
and retrieving the resulting photos remained decidedly low-tech.<br>
Once pictures came back from the photofinisher, they got tucked away in desk
drawers and shoe boxes. If anybody wanted to look at them, the pictures first had to
be found and then sorted anew for each viewing. (It is true that some people neatly
filed their pictures in photo albums. But even then it was hard for more than one or
two people to look at them simultaneously.) Enter the solution_the Kodak Photo CD
system, a new technology that makes looking at pictures as easy as watching TV.
Photo CD discs give people a new way to share their pictures__and to do a lot more.
Using a Photo CD player, consumers can zoom in on a favorite portion of the photo,
determine the display order of the photos, skip a photo, pan from left to right, or tilt
up and down. Best of all, the Photo CD system makes it easy for people to store their
pictures and just as easy to find the ones they're looking for.<br>
"In the consumer electronics arena, people don't buy technology for technology's
sake," said Stephen S. Stepnes, general manager and vice president of CD Imaging
at Kodak. "But they will grab onto a new technology if it makes something they do
more convenient, easier, or more fun. The Kodak Photo CD system does exactly
that."
Kodak developed the Photo CD system together with the Netherlands-based
electronics company Philips NV. Its technology is, in many ways, similar to that
behind audio compact discs. In fact, a Photo CD disc looks like a gold-colored CD.
The players that consumers use to view their photos on television will play audio CDs
on their stereo systems_but with a brand new capability.<br>
The first Kodak Photo CD players were delivered to consumers on schedule in early
August 1992. At a kick-off event at a stereo-video store in San Diego, California,
people lined up to get their first look at the new technology.<br>
Stepnes said the early enthusiasm came as no surprise. "In many ways, the Kodak
Photo CD system promises to do for consumer photography what audio CDs did for
music. It's a new way to enjoy an immensely popular form of entertainment."
<p> 
<i>Simple to Use</i><br>
Using the Kodak Photo CD system is easy. Consumers take pictures just as they
always have, using standard 35 mm cameras and film. At the photofinisher, they have
an additional option: the film images can be transferred at full resolution to a Kodak
Photo CD Master disc.<br>
The Kodak Photo CD Master disc is a 120 mm platter that can hold about 100
images, or four 24-exposure rolls of film. Kodak Photo CD Master discs are
nonerasable, so pictures cannot be inadvertently lost (though Photo CD players are
programmable and can be set to skip over any unwanted pictures).<br>
Pictures stored on Kodak Photo CD Master discs are high-resolution images. The
discs offer image resolution that is 16 times as great as today's TV standards and
four times the standards currently being considered for HDTV.<br>
The Kodak Photo CD Master disc can also function as a "digital negative," which
means consumers can take the disc to their photofinisher to have prints made.<br>
The disc's digital technology provides real benefits to consumers. Pictures can be
added, which allows the discs to be used as "electronic photo albums." A single disc
can contain the favorite photographs of a baby's first year, a wedding, or other
special events.<br>
At the time Photo CD players were introduced, more than a dozen photofinishers
around the country had the ability to create Kodak Photo CD Master discs. By the
end of 1992, nearly 90 percent of all photofinishing drop-off points are expected to
offer film to Photo CD transfer services. <br>
Consumers display their pictures by inserting the disc into a Photo CD player that
they operate with a simple remote control. The viewer can select specific images,
program them to appear in a particular order, rotate the image, or zoom in on part of
it for a close-up.<br>
Kodak is offering three Photo CD players during 1992, each of which has state-of-the-
art audio capability, in addition to a unique set of picture-viewing features:
<ul>
  <li>  One is a low-priced player with basic picture-viewing and audio CD features.
     It allows the viewer to delete some pictures from the playback sequence and
     to keep others. It can also remember the changes, which eliminates the need
     to program a disc each time it is viewed. An "autoplay" feature allows the
     player to automatically sequence through selected images at intervals of two
     seconds.
  <li>  A deluxe player offers a variety of more advanced viewing options. Users can
     view close-ups of their images, selecting a rectangular portion for magnification
     with the "2X tele" feature. Another feature, "expanded favorite picture
     selection," provides additional memory for recalling the individual picture edits
     and viewing order selections of more discs.
  <li>  A third model offers all of the advanced features of the deluxe version with the
     addition of a five-disc carousel. This player also provides on-screen display of
     the selected image number for easy indexing and fast photo identification.
The first two players are available now. The multidisc unit will be available in Fall
1992.
</ul>
<i>Beyond 35 mm: The Next Phase</i><br>
Consumers around the world shoot about 60 billion photographs every year, 85
percent of which are on 35 mm film. That's why the first phase of Kodak's Photo CD
program focused on making 35 mm pictures widely available to consumers on Photo
CD Master discs.<br>
But the benefits of Photo CD technology are not limited to amateur photography. The
Kodak Image Pac file format, which Kodak created to store high-resolution 35 mm
photographic images, was also designed to be adapted to a wide range of other
imaging needs. As the first Photo CD players are being delivered to consumers, the
company is moving to extend the Photo CD concept to mainstream professional and
commercial business users. Kodak has developed a new Photo CD format aimed at
consumers and has announced additional disc formats, products, and applications
that offer opportunities for professional photographers, for those involved in a range
of other commercial enterprises, and for users of desktop computers.<br>
The formats and products demonstrate Kodak's long-range vision for the technology,
as well as the company's commitment to its customers. All of the new disc formats
are compatible with the core Photo CD format.
<p> 
<i>Consumers</i><br>
The new consumer format is the Kodak Photo CD Portfolio disc, which lets anyone
with Photo CD images create special discs that merge those images with text,
graphics, and sound. A "programmed access" capability built into the new format
enables people to create discs of subjects such as family trees, which allow the
viewer to look at pictures of any member of the family simply by choosing the
appropriate branch from an on-screen menu.<br>
In addition to discs produced at the photofinisher, it's also expected that third-party
publishers will use the Kodak Photo CD Portfolio format to distribute prerecorded titles
for education or entertainment. Titles will include specialized collections in areas such
as art, sports, and nature.<br>
Kodak Photo CD Portfolio discs have a distinctive trade dress to distinguish them
from other discs, but they are fully compatible with today's Photo CD players. When
the new discs become available in 1993, those who have already purchased players
will be able to play the discs.<br>
Features of Kodak Photo CD Portfolio discs are shared by the original Photo CD
format, now called Kodak Photo CD Master. The major differences are that Kodak
Photo CD Portfolio discs can hold up to 800 TV-resolution images. In contrast, on
Kodak Photo CD Master discs all images are recorded in full photographic resolution.
Kodak Photo CD Master discs hold up to 100 images. Both formats have the ability
to hold up to one hour of CD audio-quality stereo sound or a combination of sound
and images. They also share the ability to use programmed access to give
consumers more viewing choices and to have text and graphics combined with
photos on the discs.
<p> 
<i>Professional Photographers</i><br>
The Kodak Pro Photo CD Master disc is designed for professional photographers.
The Kodak Pro Photo CD Master disc carries its own trade dress but otherwise looks
very much like its consumer cousin.<br>
The key difference is the feature set built in to meet the requirements of professional
photographers. Kodak Pro Photo CD Master discs store images from the larger film
formats favored by professionals, including 120, 70 mm, and 4 x 5-inch, as well as
35 mm.<br>
Because these larger film formats contain more image information, Kodak Pro Photo
CD Master image files are also larger. Depending on the film format, the discs can
hold from 25 to 100 images.<br>
To help control how a professional's images are used, the Kodak Pro Photo CD
Master format offers three security features: a special identifier to indicate image
ownership and copyright, the ability to place a watermark (such as "PROOF") over
an image, and the ability to encrypt high-resolution images to impede unauthorized
use.
Kodak Pro Photo CD Master discs will be available from professional photo labs
beginning in the spring of 1993.
<p> 
<i>Other Commercial Users</i><br>
By providing a low-cost way to store and distribute images in digital form, Photo CD
technology presents an almost limitless potential for commercial applications in
addition to professional photography. To illustrate this potential, Kodak has
announced two new disc formats_the Kodak Photo CD Catalog and the Kodak Photo
CD Medical_targeted at applications from mail-order retailing to health care, as well
as an image library and international image network to provide easy access to images
for any commercial user.<br>
The Kodak Photo CD Catalog is designed for organizations_such as mail-order
retailers, tourism associations, or art galleries_that want to store large numbers of
images on a disc and distribute these images widely. As many as 6,000 images can
be stored at video resolution on Kodak Photo CD Catalog discs for soft display on TV
sets or computer monitors. (The images are of lower resolution than standard Kodak
Photo CD Master discs or Kodak Pro Photo CD Master discs and can't be used to
make photo-quality prints.)<br>
The images can be combined with text and graphics and organized into chapters and
pages to resemble a traditional catalog. People who play the discs on home Photo
CD players will see on-screen menus that lead them through the catalog's pages at
the touch of a remote control. Those who run Kodak Photo CD Catalog discs on
computers can also locate images with simple key word searches, by using Kodak
Browser software, which is contained on each Kodak Photo CD Catalog.
For medical applications, Kodak is developing another new format that stores
diagnostic images. Along with film-based images like photographs, the Kodak Photo
CD Medical format will store digital diagnostic modalities_for example, computed
tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance images (MR)_on compact disc, all
at full resolution.<br>
Potential applications for the Kodak Photo CD Medical format include training and
education, distribution of patient files, and long-term storage of diagnostic images.
The discs will comply with most medical industry standards for digital imaging. Along
with its multiple disc formats, Kodak has developed new products and services to give
commercial users easy access to all types of images stored on Photo CD discs. <br>
One is a product called the Kodak Professional Photo CD Image Library, an
automated disc library, or "jukebox," that holds as many as 100 Photo CD discs. The
library can store thousands or hundreds of thousands of images, depending on the
type of Photo CD discs it contains. Users can rapidly search for and retrieve any of
these images by keying in requests at a desktop computer. Although the library will
give individual customers easy access to images internally, Kodak has also
announced its intent to create an imaging network that will use telephone lines to link
the distributors of images, such as stock photo houses, with potential customers
worldwide. <br>
The Kodak Picture Exchange is a new Kodak business that will give users access to
a huge database of images, just as networks like CompuServe provide access to text
and data. With a desktop computer and a modem, users will be able to search the
Kodak Picture Exchange database and request hard copies of images electronically.
Kodak Picture Exchange will alert the image providers immediately, allowing them to
fulfil requests promptly by air express. In the future, as the data-carrying capacity of
telephone lines expands, it will be possible to fulfil requests directly over the
telephone.<br>
In addition, Kodak has joined with more than a dozen companies, universities, and
organizations to cooperate on the new commercial applications announced today.
These cooperative agreements include licensing the Kodak technology to some of the
biggest names in the computer, electronics, and photography industries_including
Apple, Adobe, Sony, and Fuji.<br>
"The number of potential commercial uses for Photo CD technology is limited only by
the imagination," Stepnes said. "Although Kodak is already working on a large
number of specific applications, we expect that number to multiply rapidly as our
customers begin to work with the technology and understand its potential."
<p>
<i>Desktop Computer Users</i><br>
For consumers or commercial customers, Photo CD technology provides a convenient
new way to input high-resolution images into desktop computing applications. Photo
CD discs give people a way to take their own photographic images and convert them
inexpensively into a digital format. The discs can be played in Photo CD-compatible
CD-ROM XA drives, which are widely available and also relatively inexpensive. <br>
As a result, all types of computer users can take advantage of the technology_from
a consumer composing a family newsletter for a holiday mailing, to an art director
creating page layouts for a commercial magazine. Kodak has developed a family of
five software products designed for all types of users. <br>
Two of the five provide easy search and retrieval of images stored in databases; the
remaining three allow users to work with individual Photo CD images in different
ways.
The most basic of the two database software products is Kodak Browser software,
which is contained on all Kodak Photo CD Catalog discs and which allows for easy
search and retrieval of images using key words. The second is Kodak Shoebox
software, which offers more powerful search and retrieval functions for customers with
large image databases.<br>
The other three software packages provide different levels of image-editing capability
to meet the needs of different users:
<ul>
<li>    Kodak Photo CD Access software<br>
          for casual users, is a low-cost tool that makes it easy to read and
          display Photo CD images and to import them into current applications
          (for example, Adobe PhotoShop or Aldus PhotoStyler software). It
          performs basic functions like cropping, zooming, and image rotation.
<li>    Kodak PhotoEdge software<br>
          for business users who are beginning to work with Photo CD images.
          It provides the same functionality as Access software, with the
          additional ability to edit the overall appearance of images_such as
          sharpening the focus and adjusting color or contrast.
<li>    Kodak Renaissance software<br>
          a page layout package for professional users and is newly equipped
          with Photo CD capability. The software allows text, graphics, and
          images to be merged into comprehensive layouts and gives the
          designer the ability to adjust those layouts easily to experiment with
          different ideas.
</ul>
All of the Kodak software packages employ user interfaces that are designed to be
simple and intuitive, making it easy to move to more advanced software packages as
needs change. They have the same look and feel that characterizes applications
running in the Apple Macintosh or Windows 3.x environments, with icons and pull-
down menus to guide the user.<br>
Stepnes explained that the common look and feel of Kodak's Photo CD software
products reflect the vision behind the Kodak Photo CD system. 
"Kodak developed Photo CD technology to give consumers an exciting new way to
enjoy their pictures, but we didn't stop there," he said. "We developed the technology
with future applications in mind_so the players that consumers buy today will provide
them even greater functionality in the future.<br>
"Quite simply, the Photo CD system gives consumers and commercial customers the
best of two technologies," Stepnes concluded. "It provides the convenience, low cost,
and image quality of traditional photography combined with the benefits of digital
technology_the ability to display, enhance, and transmit images electronically."

<h2>The Kodak Photo CD: some technical background</h2>

<h3>How does Photo CD work?</h3>

In a nutshell, 35mm film (negative, slide, B&W, internegative) is scanned by an image
scanner and transferred to XA-formatted CD-ROM discs. These discs are
manufactured by burning (writing) -- not by pressing.
<p>
Each scanned image on the disc is kept in five resolutions. These five resolutions are
called: Base/16, Base/4, Base, 4Base, and 16Base. As examples, Base/16 is one
sixteenth the resolution of the "Base" image, and 16Base is sixteen times the
resolution of "Base". (These are not simply larger picture elements. There are in
increased number of scan lines.)
<p>
The 4Base and 16Base images are compressed using Huffman encoding. This
means no information is lost during compression. You need the decompression
software to pull the higher resolutions out of the image. You would typically need
these higher resolutions if you want enlargements or if you intend to use an HDTV
as a display device.

<h3>Resolutions</h3>

Normally, all 5 resolutions are stored on a PhotoCD disc. The highest resolution is
3072x2048, the lowest 192x128. All resolutions are stored in one file. Although some
resolutions might be missing from a certain image, a Kodak photoshop puts all
resolutions in the image files.
<p>
The master Photo CD has 5 resolutions:
<ul>
<li>     base/16   128 x 192
<li>     base/4    256 x 384
<li>     base      512 x 768
<li>     4base     1024 x 1536
<li>     16base    2048 x 3072
</ul>
All 5 resolutions are always stored when you transfer film, thus you get the ability to
choose the resolution that best fits your computer system limitations. The PRO
Master PhotoCD adds a sixth resolution - 64base which is 4096 x 6144.
<p>
All the access software, modules let you access any of the 5 resolutions on a master
Photo CD, or even parts of an image at any of the resolutions.

<h3>The new PhotoCD Formats</h3>

The new Photo CD formats include:
<ul>
<li>    The Kodak Pro Photo CD Master disc,<br>
          which stores images from 35 mm and larger film formats to meet the
          needs of professional photographers
<li>    The Kodak Photo CD Portfolio disc,<br>
          which extends picture capacity from the original Photo CD Master
          format and allows the creation of exciting on-disc programs that merge
          pictures with text, graphics, sound, and branching
<li>    The Kodak Photo CD Catalog disc,<br>
          which allows easy distribution of disc catalogues containing thousands
          of pictures of images for rent, art works or retail products
<li>    The Kodak Photo CD Medical disc,<br>
          which can store diagnostic images, from a variety of image modalities,
          for medical applications
</ul>
<h3>PhotoCD Hardware</h3>

The new commercial and professional hardware systems include:
<ul>
<li>    The Kodak Professional Photo CD Imaging Workstation 4200 (Professional
     PIW 4200),<br>
          which features the new Kodak Professional Photo CD film scanner 4045
          to transfer images from large-format professional films to Pro Photo CD
          Master discs
<li>    The Kodak Professional Photo CD Image Library,<br>
          an automated disc "jukebox" system that stores and accesses
          thousands of images on all formats of Photo CD discs
<li>    The Kodak Photo CD Imaging Workstation 2400 (PIW 2400), <br>
          a Photo CD authoring station for photofinishing labs that's over three
          times as productive as today's units
</ul> 
<h3>PhotoCD Software</h3>

The commercial and professional software includes:
<ul>
<li>    Kodak Photo CD Access software,<br>
          launched earlier at MacWorld Expo, which gives DOS/Windows and
          Macintosh operating system users the ability to read and save Photo
          CD images.
<li>    Kodak PhotoEdge image enhancement and correction software,<br>
          which provides business users with a set of basic image-editing tools
<li>    Kodak Browser software,<br>
          a basic image database package that allows easy key word search and
          retrieval. This product is only available on Kodak's new Photo CD
          Catalog disc. It comes on every Kodak Photo CD Catalog disc.
<li>    Kodak Shoebox image search and retrieval database software<br>
          expands on the capabilities of Kodak Browser software, offering more
          powerful database functions to people who need to search through
          large numbers of stored images.
<li>    Kodak Renaissance design software,<br>
          an intuitive page layout package that has been upgraded to allow direct
          importation of Photo CD images
</ul>
--<br>
Kodak advertises a new "Shoebox Photo CD Image Manager" that is capable of
setting up a database of slides, with images associated to them.
<p>
Other programs that can do that are (probably) Borland Paradox, Corel Mosaic, and
Microsoft Access.

<h3>Number of images</h3>

Normally a PhotoCD will hold about 100 images. The number of pictures that can be
stored depends on the size of all the image files (PhotoCD uses a lossless
compression for the highest two resolutions). If there's still space on a PhotoCD, you
can keep adding images.

<h3>Premium and Economy</h3>

Kodak mentions two choices, Premium and Economy image transfers. Premium costs
$1.99 per image, and economy is $.59 per image. Probably the difference between
premium and economy is how much care they take in the transfer of the images.
Economy is running it through as fast as they can (with minimal cleaning, balance
adjustment) while premium would be careful treatment.

<h3>Portfolio</h3>

The new consumer format is the Kodak Photo CD Portfolio disc, which lets anyone
with Photo CD images create special discs that merge those images with text,
graphics, and sound. A "programmed access" capability built into the new format
enables people to create discs of subjects such as family trees, which allow the
viewer to look at pictures of any member of the family simply by choosing the
appropriate branch from an on-screen menu.
<p>
In the future Portfolio Photo CDs will be available that can have 3 of the 5 resolutions
(bottom 3) and are designed more for low end interactive disks.

<h3>Pro-PCD</h3>

Pro Photo CD, coming soon to many Photo CD production sites around the country.
Delivers a maximum of 72Mb images (4k x 6k) from scanned 4 x 5's -- compressed
of course. Pro-PCD discs hold 20 - 25 images at high resolution.

<h3>       Detailed description of data available on CD-ROM</h3>

Parts from the following list of CD-ROM's available from other institutions has been
extracted from the NASA Master Directory (MD), which is operated at NSSDC. The
MD is a free, on-line multidisciplinary directory of data sets that are of potential
interest to the Earth and space science community. The MD contains descriptions of
data sets; not the data sets themselves. The intent is to be a first pointer to a wide
variety of data.
<p>
The MD is more that just a directory, however. In order to simplify the process of
finding more detailed information or accessing on-line data, the MD provides
automatic connections - called LINKs - to a number of data systems such as the
NASA Climate Data System (NCDS), Global Land Information System (GLIS),
Canadian Center for Remote Sensing (CCRS), Energetic Ion Composition
Spectrometer File (EICS), Space Environment Laboratory (SEL) and others; as of late
1991, 47 such systems were LINKED to the MD.

*    The Airborne Antarctic Ozone Experiment (AAOE), Including Halley Bay Ozonesonde Data on
     CD-ROM

Summary:
     This CD-ROM contains atmospheric composition and dynamics data collected over Antarctica
     for the purpose of studying the ozone hole and was based in Punta Arenas, Chile during
     August and September 1987. The data was primarily collected onboard the NASA ER-2 and
     DC-8 aircraft which flew into the ozone hole, along with ozonesonde data collected from April
     through November at 4 Antarctic stations--Halley Bay, McMurdo, Palmer Station, and the
     South Pole. The experiment tested the chemical and dynamical theories of the ozone hole
     using the aircraft data in theoretical computer models of the chemistry and dynamics of the
     stratosphere. The mission was organized and funded by NASA, NOAA, NSF, universities,
     Chemical Manufacturer's Association, and meteorological agencies overseas.

*    The Airborne Arctic Stratospheric Expedition (AASE) and the Meteorological Measurement
     System (MMS) Data CD-ROM's

Summary:
     These CD-ROM's contain atmospheric dynamics and composition data collected over the
     Arctic for the purpose of studying ozone production and loss, and the effect on cloud
     formation. The first CD-ROM contains the Second Edition of data pertaining to the Airborne
     Arctic Stratospheric Expedition (AASE) which was based in Stavanger, Norway during January
     and February, 1989. The second CD-ROM contains all of the 5 Hz data from the ER-2
     Meteorological Measurement System (MMS) taken during the 1989 AASE associated with
     flights during which mesoscale disturbances were observed. This disc was generated as an
     appendix to the primary AASE CD-ROM dataset. The data consists of measurements collected
     onboard the NASA ER-2 and DC-8 aircraft, ozonesonde soundings from three stations
     (Angmagssalik and Scoresbysund, Greenland, and Lerwick, U.K.), aerosol and temperature
     profiles from the SAM II spacecraft, global grid point values of Nimbus-7 TOMS ozone, and
     selected radiosonde soundings from stations in the region of the experiment. The mission was
     organized and funded by NASA, NOAA, NSF, universities, Chemical Manufacturers
     Association, and meteorological agencies overseas, utilizing similar instrumentation that was
     deployed during the Airborne Antarctic Ozone Experiment (AAOE) of 1987.

*    The Stratosphere-Troposphere Exchange Project (STEP) Data on CD-ROM

Summary:
     This CD-ROM contains atmospheric dynamics and composition data collected over the western
     U.S. and Australia for the purpose of studying the different aspects of stratosphere-
     troposphere exchange. STEP was conducted onboard the NASA ER-2 aircraft in January and
     February, 1987 based in Darwin, Australia. This mission was the last of 6 STEP missions
     which started with the Variability and Global Tropospheric Experiment (GTE) Coop assignment
     in April 1984, based in Moffett Field, California. Altogether, 4 science missions and 2
     intercalibration missions comprised STEP, with the science missions designed to investigate
     different aspects of stratosphere-troposphere exchange (in mass, trace gases, and aerosols),
     including cloud-free and cloud-dominated mechanisms in both the mid-latitudes and the
     tropics. STEP also observed the extreme dryness of the stratosphere. STEP was carried out
     under NASA and the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

     Global GRASS 1

Summary:
     The Global Geographic Resources Analysis Support System (GRASS) Version 1 CD-ROM
     Data Set from Rutgers University.
     The Cook College Remote Sensing Center of Rutgers University and the U.S. Army Corps of
     Engineers Construction Engineering Research Laboratory (USA/CERL) have signed a
     cooperative agreement that will allow Rutgers to make available the CERL Global GRASS
     digital data set on CD-ROM. This data set includes 50 different raster files for use in global
     scale research and education, and all files cover the entire world. The data set includes
     elevation, vegetation type, AVHRR satellite composites, national boundaries, soil
     characteristics, marine productivity, surface albedo, and ecological zones.
     To users of the public domain GRASS GIS and image processing system, the CD-ROM will
     act as an additional hard disk, since the data are stored in the GRASS directory structure.
     GRASS now has a full set of global (latitude/longitude) analysis capabilities. To others with a
     different GIS, the data are all stored in a simple (uncompressed, flat) file format to make
     importing the data as simple as possible.
     This copyrighted work is being made available to increase research and teaching activities in
     global studies and analysis around the world. The second Global data set is now in
     preparation, and will be followed by additional CD-ROM's on about an annual basis.
     If you have data sets that could be included in future CD-ROM's, please contact the Cook
     College Remote Sensing Center at Rutgers University

                TOMS Gridded Ozone Data Update

           Data spans from 1989-01-01 to 1992-01-31

The gridded Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) data from Nimbus-7 (GRIDTOMS) is the first
data set on the third TOMS CD-ROM volume. The GRIDTOMS data set extends the GRIDTOMS
measurements archived on the first TOMS CD-ROM volume (78-098A-09Z) from January 1, 1989
through January 31, 1992. The first GRIDTOMS data set covers the time period from November 1,
1978 through December 31, 1988.

TOMS measures ozone by measuring the solar ultraviolet irradiance scattered from the Earth's
atmosphere. Total column ozone is inferred from the differential absorption of scattered solar ultraviolet
radiation. Ozone is calculated from the ratio of two wavelengths where one wavelength is strongly
absorbed by ozone and the other is weakly absorbed.

Ozone is  measured in a 50 km square field-of-view of the TOMS instrument. The instrument collects
35 measurements every 8 seconds as it scans from right to left, giving about 200,000 ozone
measurements every day. The individual measurements that comprise the GRIDTOMS data set are
averaged into grid cells 1 degree in latitude by 1.25 degrees in longitude. The software on the CD-
ROM was written specifically for an IBM PC (or compatible).

Detailed information of 78-098A-09c:
                 TOMS Image Ozone Data Update

           Data spans from 1989-01-01 to 1992-01-31

The gridded image Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) data from Nimbus-7 (TOMSIMG) is
the second data set on the third TOMS CD-ROM volume. The TOMSIMG data set extends the
TOMSIMG images archived on the second TOMS CD-ROM volume (78-098A-09a) from January 1,
1989 through January 31, 1992. The first TOMSIMG data set covers the time period from November
1, 1978 through March 31, 1991.

The TOMSIMG data set contains daily, monthly and yearly images of TOMS ozone data in three
projections (simple latitude/longitude, south polar, and north polar). Multiple images can be displayed
simultaneously or in series, and the user can re-scale the data and select one of 5 pre-defined color
palettes or create a new color palette.

The TOMSIMG data are derived from the 1 degree by 1.25 degree GRIDTOMS data, and are
smoothed to 2 degree by 5 degree resolution. The software on the third CD-ROM TOMS volume was
written specifically for an IBM PC (or compatible) computer and the image software requires a VGA
graphics board.

Detailed information of 78-098A-09d:
                   TOMS Ozone Overpass Data

           Data spans from 1978-11-01 to 1992-01-31

The individual ozone data (OVERPASS) from the Nimbus-7 Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer
(TOMS) is the third data set on the third TOMS CD-ROM volume. This data set contains individual
TOMS measurements most nearly coincident with specific geographic locations. The data includes
ozone measurements in Dobson units for 333 sites.

The OVERPASS data set covers the time period from November 1, 1978 through January 31, 1992.
The list of sites was compiled to accommodate varied interests including Dobson sites, M83 sites, a
selection of large cities, launch sites, and other general or scientific interest sites. The criteria for
selecting the TOMS data point closest to a site are: (1) The TOMS field-of-view (FOV) must be within
1 degree of latitude and 1 degree of longitude of the ground site; (2) the overpass selection is weighted
to select near-nadir passes; and (3) flagged ozone data are used only if non-flagged data are not
available.

All of the data are in ASCII format.  Each data record includes the date, scan position, time, latitude
and longitude of the TOMS measurement, total ozone in Dobson units (milli-atm-cm), reflectivity (%),
solar zenith angle, and a data quality flag. Software and documentation is included on the CD-ROM.
The software on the CD-ROM was written specifically for an IBM PC (or compatible) computer.

Detailed information of 78-098A-09e:
                SBUV MG-II Index/Solar UV Flux

           Data spans from 1978-11-01 to 1987-03-31

The solar measurements from the Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (SBUV) experiment on Nimbus-7 and
SBUV/2 on NOAA-9 and NOAA-11 is the fourth data set on the third TOMS CD-ROM volume. The
SOLAR data was collected by the SBUV and SBUV/2 for the period November 1, 1978 through
January 31, 1992.

The data set consists of composite Magnesium II (Mg II) index, scale factor data, and reference solar
spectrum data. The composite Mg II index is a daily measurement of the solar ultraviolet variability
using the Mg II absorption feature at 280 nm. The Mg II index can be used in conjunction with the
composite scale factors to estimate solar irradiance variations at any wavelength in the 170-400 nm
wavelength range.

The Mg II index is a dimensionless quantity measuring mid-ultraviolet solar activity. It is a ratio of
irradiances, where the numerator consists of the average of three consecutive wavelength samples
at the core of the unresolved Mg II h & k doublet at 280 nm, and the denominator is the average of
two pairs of consecutive wavelengths equally spaced approximately 3 nm from the core wavelength.

The Mg II index was constructed from SBUV data on Nimbus-7 and SBUV/2 data on NOAA-9 and
NOAA-11. The Nimbus-7 Mg II index data is from November 1978 to March 1987. The NOAA-9 Mg
II index data is from March 1985 to September 1990. The NOAA-11 Mg II index data is from February
1990 to January 1992.

The composite Mg II index data are referenced to the NOAA-9 SBUV/2 absolute reference scale. The
data set consists of the composite daily Mg II index data. A 5-day binomial-weighted average has been
applied to the data set. The Mg II data are in ASCII format and the data records contain the year, day-
of-year, Julian day (beginning 1 January 1978), and the Mg II index value. The composite scale factors
data set contains scaling factors which can be used to estimate the solar irradiance variability at other
UV wavelengths. The scale factor data are a combination of the best results for Nimbus-7, NOAA-9
and NOAA-11. The composite scale factor data are in ASCII and consist of the wavelength (170-400
nm) at 1 nm spacing, the composite scale factor, and the weighted average of standard deviation
values.

The reference solar spectrum is the absolute solar spectral irradiance values in the mid-UV wavelength
region for Nimbus-7. The spectrum is an average of five separate spectra taken from November 7-12,
1978, and interpolated to a 0.2 nm grid using a cubic spline. The solar irradiance data are in ASCII
and consist  of the wavelength (170-400 nm) at 0.2 nm spacing, and the irradiance in W/cm**2/cm.

               TOMS Daily Zonal Mean Ozone Data

           Data spans from 1978-11-01 to 1992-01-31

The zonal average Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) data from Nimbus-7 (ZONALAV) is
the last data set on the third TOMS CD-ROM volume. The data consists of two files: northern and
southern hemisphere, and each contains 10-degree zonally averaged ozone data from November 1,
1978 through December 31, 1991. Each data record consists of the date, 10-degree total ozone zonal
averages in Dobson units centered at 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, 55, and 65 degrees for each hemisphere.
There is no data poleward of 70 degrees. Documentation is included on the CD-ROM.

                   <h2>CD-ROMs available at the
      CARBON DIOXIDE INFORMATION ANALYSIS CENTER - CDIAC</h2>

The Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC), located within the
Environmental Sciences Division of Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Oak Ridge,
Tennessee, provides information to help international researchers, policymakers, and
educators evaluate complex environmental issues associated with elevated levels of
atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and other radiatively active trace gases, including
potential climate change. CDIAC is sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy's
(DOE) Global Change Research Program (GCRP). Dr. Ari Patrinos is the Director of
DOE's Environmental Sciences Division and Program Manager of GCRP. Thomas J.
Gross is the GCRP program manager with responsibility for CDIAC. Robert M.
Cushman is Director of CDIAC and Thomas A. Boden serves as CDIAC's Deputy
Director. In operation since 1982, CDIAC

and technical aspects of issues related to carbon dioxide, methane, and other trace
gas emissions; the carbon cycle; and other climate-change topics. The centre's
eclectic data holdings are related to the issues of concern rather than the specific
scientific disciplines.

<h3>NUMERIC DATA PACKAGES (NDP)</h3>

CDIAC's principal products are its quality-assured, fully documented Numeric Data
Packages (NDPs). These information products provide comprehensive documentation
of benchmark data sets provided by investigators from around the world. NDPs
consist of written documentation and transfer media containing machine-readable
text, retrieval codes, and data files. In addition to being available on this anonymous
FTP area, available transfer media include CD-ROM, 9-track magnetic tapes and
IBM-formatted, floppy diskettes.
<p>
The most critical components of the NDP process are quality assurance,
documentation of the data, and review before distribution. CDIAC puts the data
through a rigorous and extensive quality- assurance review. After the data are
checked, they are documented with text, data listings, illustrations, and computer
codes. Unabridged reprints of pertinent literature are included as part of the
documentation. Individuals contributing data are actively involved in the
documentation process, and no NDP is distributed without written permission from the
person or agency that contributed the data.

ATMOSPHERIC CO2 CONCENTRATIONS - MAUNA LOA OBSERVATORY, HAWAII, 1958-1991
C. D. Keeling
T.P. Whorf
Scripps Institution of Oceanography

Since 1958, air samples have been continuously collected at Mauna Loa Observatory and analyzed
by infrared spectroscopy for CO2 concentrations. Data are averaged to give monthly and annual
atmospheric CO2 concentrations.

These data represent the longest continuous record of atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the world.
This precise data record covers a single site (Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii). It is a reliable indicator
of the regional trend in the concentration of atmospheric CO2 in the middle layers of the troposphere
and is critical to CO2-related research. The data are in one file taking 2.5 kB.

NDP-002 (1984)
TREE-RING-CHRONOLOGY INDICES AND RECONSTRUCTIONS OF PRECIPITATION IN
CENTRAL IOWA, USA
T. J. Blasing and D. N. Duvick
Oak Ridge National Laboratory

Tree core samples (4 mm in diameter) were extracted from the trunks of white oak (Quercus alba) at
three sites in central Iowa (Duvick Back Woods, Ledges State Park, and Pammel). At least 60 trees
were sampled at each site, and at least two cores were taken from each tree. The growth rings of each
core were dated by calendar year and measured; the measurements were then transformed into
dimensionless ring-width indices and correlated with annual precipitation. Data were collected for the
years 1680 through 1979. Each tree ring was characterized by the site, year, tree-ring-width index,
number of core samples, decade year, and the annual reconstructed precipitation estimate. These data
have more than 50% of their variance in common with the known annual statewide average
precipitation for Iowa and serve as useful indicators of the precipitation and drought history of the
region for the past 300 years. The data are in two files: tree-ring-chronology data (8 kB) and the
annual reconstructed precipitation data for central Iowa (2 kB).

NDP-003/R1 (Rev. 1986)
GLOBAL SURFACE-AIR TEMPERATURE VARIATIONS: 1851-1984
P. D. Jones, S. C. B. Raper, P. M. Kelly, and T. M. L. Wigley
University of East Anglia

Monthly and annual surface-air temperature anomalies relative to the 1951-1970 mean surface-air
temperature were calculated for the periods of 1851-1984 for the Northern Hemisphere, 1858-1984 for
the Southern Hemisphere exclusive of Antarctica, and 1958-1984 for the Southern Hemisphere
inclusive of Antarctica. These estimates are derived from land-based meteorological station data and
fixed-position weather-ship data interpolated onto a 5 degree latitude by 10 degree longitude grid. The
data are in three files, one for the Northern Hemisphere temperature anomalies (10 kB) and two for
the Southern Hemisphere temperature anomalies (9 kB, 2 kB).


NDP-004/R1 (Rev. 1986)
TRANSIENT TRACERS IN THE OCEANS (TTO) - HYDROGRAPHIC DATA AND CARBON
DIOXIDE SYSTEMS WITH REVISED CARBON CHEMISTRY DATA
P. G. Brewer
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
T. Takahashi
Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory
R. T. Williams
Scripps Institution of Oceanography

The 1981 TTO North Atlantic experiment cruise consisted of seven legs and visited 250 hydrographic
stations across the North Atlantic Ocean in 200 days. About 9000 water samples were taken for
analysis of salinity, oxygen, and nutrients. More than 3000 samples were collected for tritium analysis,
and more than 1000 samples for radiocarbon analysis. Samples were characterized hydrographically
(e.g., sample depth, ocean depth, and water temperature) and chemically (e.g., alkalinity, salinity,
silicate concentrations, and nitrate concentrations). They may be used for ocean-mixing studies, for
testing models of ocean CO2 uptake, and for determining the exchange of carbon dioxide between the
atmosphere and the ocean. The data are in two files [original TTO data (0.67 MB) and revised TTO
data (0.86 MB)].

NDP-005/R1 (Rev. 1990)
ATMOSPHERIC CO2 CONCENTRATIONS - THE NOAA/GMCC FLASK SAMPLING NETWORK
T. J. Conway and P. Tans
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration

Flask air samples are collected approximately once per week at 29 stations scattered around the
globe. The earliest samples were taken in 1968, but the period of record varies from station to station.
The samples are analyzed for atmospheric CO2 concentration on a nondispersive infrared gas
analyzer apparatus at the NOAA/GMCC laboratory in Boulder, Colorado. The measurements are
directly traceable to the World Meteorological Organization primary CO2 standards. Each sample is
characterized by station, year, sampling date and time, flask identification number, CO2 concentration,
date and time of analysis, and quality indicators. The data are in 30 files [one file that contains data
through 1981 (946 kB), and one file for each site with data from 1981 through 1986 (ranging from 3.6
to 55.8 kB)].

NDP-006 (1984)
PRODUCTION OF CO2 FROM FOSSIL-FUEL BURNING
R. M. Rotty and G. Marland
Oak Ridge Associated Universities

Global carbon dioxide emissions for 1950 through 1982 were estimated by Marland and Rotty (1984)
from fuel production data from the U.N. Energy Statistics Yearbook (1983, 1984). Data before 1950
came from Keeling (1973). Fuel-production data were used in these calculations because they
appeared to be more reliable on a global basis than fuel-consumption data. The data given are the
year and annual global CO2 emissions (annual global total; cumulative global total since 1860; and
annual global emissions from solid fuels, liquid fuels, natural gas, gas flaring, and cement
manufacturing). These data provide the only pre-1950 estimates of the amount of carbon emitted to
the atmosphere from fossil-fuel burning. The CO2 emission record since 1950 has been updated and
revised several times with the most recent estimates being published by Marland et al. (1989). The
data are in one file taking 7.5 kB.

NDP-007 (1984)
ATMOSPHERIC CO2 CONCENTRATIONS - THE CSIRO (AUSTRALIA) MONITORING PROGRAM
FROM AIRCRAFT FOR 1972-1981
D. J. Beardsmore and G. I. Pearman
Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization

From 1972 through 1981, air samples were collected in glass flasks from aircraft at a variety of
latitudes and altitudes over Australia, New Zealand, and Antarctica. The samples were analyzed for
CO2 concentrations with nondispersive infrared gas analysis. The resulting data contain the sampling
dates, type of aircraft, flight number, flask identification number, sampling time, geographic sector,
distance in kilometers from the listed distance measuring equipment (DME) station, station number of
the radio navigation distance measuring equipment, altitude of the aircraft above mean sea level,
sample analysis date, flask pressure, tertiary standards used for the analysis, analyzer used, and CO2
concentration. These data represent the first published record of CO2 concentrations in the Southern
Hemisphere expressed in the WMO 1981 CO2 Calibration Scale and provide a precise record of
atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the troposphere and lower stratosphere over Australia and New
Zealand. The data are in one file taking 263 kB.

NDP-008/R3 (Rev. 1993)
ANNUAL AND SEASONAL GLOBAL TEMPERATURE ANOMALIES IN THE TROPOSPHERE AND
LOW STRATOSPHERE, 1958-1992
J. K. Angell
Air Resources Laboratory
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration

For 1958 through 1992, the annual and seasonal temperature anomalies relative to a 1958-1977 mean
(expressed in degrees Celsius) were calculated for the surface, troposphere (850-300 mb), tropopause
(300-100 mb), and low stratosphere (100-50 mb and 100-30 mb) layers on regional, hemispheric, and
global bases. Most of the values are column-mean temperatures obtained from the differences in
height between constant-pressure surfaces at individual radiosonde stations. The pressure-height data
before 1980 were obtained from published values in Monthly Climatic Data for the World. These
temperature anomalies may be used to analyze long-term temperature trends for a layer of the
atmosphere (i.e., surface, troposphere, tropopause, and low stratosphere), a region (i.e., polar,
temperate, subtropical, and equatorial), a hemisphere, or the globe. Eleven data files are provided
each 7.98 kB in size.

NDP-009 (1985)
GROWTH AND CHEMICAL RESPONSES TO CO2 ENRICHMENT - VIRGINIA PINE (Pinus
virginiana Mill.)
R. J. Luxmoore, R. J. Norby, E. G. O'Neill, and D. G. Weller Oak Ridge National Laboratory
J. M. Ells and H. H. Rogers
North Carolina State University

From June 28 to October 29 in 1982, Virginia pine seedlings were exposed to elevated CO2 levels in
open-top growth chambers at one of four concentrations (75, 150, 300, and 600 ppm above ambient).

Plant dry weight; height; stem diameter; and chemical contents of leaf, stem, and root tissues were
measured before and after exposure. Soil variables were also characterized. These data illustrate the
short-term physical and chemical response of Virginia pine seedlings to elevated levels of CO2. The
data are in seven files: initial dry weights before exposure (844 kB), dry weights after exposure (4 kB),
major nutrient concentrations after final harvest (12 kB), minor nutrient concentrations after final
harvest (17 kB), soil nutrient concentrations after final harvest (4 kB), soil leachate elements after final
harvest (5 kB), and soil leachate solutes after final harvest (4 kB).


NDP-010 (1985)
ATMOSPHERIC CO2 CONCENTRATIONS - THE CSIRO MONITORING PROGRAM: SURFACE
DATA FOR CAPE GRIM, TASMANIA
D. J. Beardsmore, G. I. Pearman, and R. C. O'Brien
Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization

From 1976 through 1983, air samples collected from a high-volume general intake 10 m above the roof
of the laboratory at Cape Grim, Tasmania, were dried and analyzed for CO2 concentrations with a
nondispersive infrared gas analyzer. This baseline CO2 record from Cape Grim indicates the CO2
concentrations in large, maritime air masses devoid of vegetative influences in this region of the
Southern Hemisphere. The data available on each sample are sampling date; daily, monthly, and
annual CO2 concentrations; standard deviation associated with each concentration; number of hours
of data used to calculate the CO2 values; and the analyzer used. The data are in three files: daily (17
kB), monthly (3 kB), and annual (310 bytes).

NDP-011 (1985)
GLOBAL PALEOCLIMATIC DATA FOR 6000 B.P.
Thompson Webb III
Brown University

To determine regional and global climatic variations during the past 6000 years, pollen, lake level, and
marine plankton data from 797 stations were compiled to form a global data set. Radiocarbon dating
and dated tephras were used to determine the ages of the specimens. The data available for the pollen
data are site number, site name, latitude, longitude, elevation, and percentages of various taxa. For
lake-level data, the data are site number, site name, latitude, longitude, and lake-level status. And for
marine plankton, the data are site number, site name, latitude, longitude, water depth, date, dating
control code, depth of sample, interpolated age of sample, estimated winter and summer sea-surface
temperatures, and percentages of various taxa. The data are in 55 files: 5 files for each of 9
geographic regions and 10 supplemental files. The files for each region include (1) a FORMAT file
describing the format and contents of the data for that region, (2) an INDEX file containing descriptive
information about each site and its data, (3) a DATA file containing the data and available climatic
estimates, (4) a PUBINDEX file indexing the bibliographic references associated with each site, and
(5) a REFERENCE file containing the bibliographic references. The files range in size from 2 to 66 kB.

NDP-012 (1985)
CLIMATIC DATA FOR NORTHERN HEMISPHERE LAND AREAS: 1851-1980
R. S. Bradley
University of Massachusetts
P. M. Kelly, P. D. Jones, and C. M. Goodess
University of East Anglia
H. F. Diaz
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration

For the period 1851 through 1985, approximately 700 temperature records and 1200 precipitation
records for Northern Hemisphere stations were added to the World Weather Records data base with
the supplemental data obtained by surveying major libraries, archives, and meteorological data centers
and by contacting scientists and meteorological agencies directly. The quality of these supplemental
data were assessed when possible by using station-history information. For each addition, the WMO
station identification number, station name, country, latitude, longitude, station elevation, beginning
year of record, ending year of record, monthly temperature, and monthly precipitation were entered.
The data are in two files, one for monthly temperature (6.40 MB) and one for monthly precipitation data
(8.06 MB). Because of the size of this data set, it is available only on 9-track magnetic tape.


NDP-013 (1985)
VOLCANIC LOADING: THE DUST VEIL INDEX
H. H. Lamb
University of East Anglia

Lamb's Dust Veil Index (DVI) is a numerical index that quantifies the impact of a particular volcanic
eruption's release of dust and aerosols over the years following the event, especially the impact on
the Earth's energy balance. DVIs have been calculated for eruptions occurring from 1500 through
1983. The methods used to calculate the DVI have been intercalibrated to give a DVI of 1000 for the
eruption of Krakatoa in 1883. The DVI for any volcanic eruption is based on a review of the
observational, empirical, and theoretical studies of the possible impact on climate of volcanic dust veils.
The DVI allows one to compare volcanic eruptions by a single numerical index. The data base includes
the name of the erupting volcano, year of eruption, volcano latitude and longitude, maximum extent
of the dust veil, veil duration, DVI for the entire globe, DVI for the Northern Hemisphere, and DVI for
the Southern Hemisphere. The data are in one file (22.6 kB).

NDP-014 (1985)
SOLAR RECORDS: THE WOLF SUNSPOT INDEX AND UMBRAL/PENUMBRAL RATIO
D. V. Hoyt
National Center for Atmospheric Research

These data from observations of sunspot activity cover the period 1875 through 1981; reconstructions
are possible back to 1832. Available sunspot models and the theory of mixing length indicate that the
observed changes in the umbral/penumbral (U/P) ratio may be equivalent to changes in the solar
constant. The U/P ratio is calculated from measurements of solar activity and has been shown to be
in good agreement with the Northern Hemisphere temperature record. The data consist of year,
number of sunspot groups, Wolf sunspot number, umbra area, whole area, penumbral area, and
umbral/penumbral ratio. The data are in one file (3.3 kB).

NDP-016 (1985)
CLIMATIC DATA FOR SELECTED U.S. AND CANADIAN STATIONS 1941-1980
T. R. Karl and F. T. Quinlan
National Climatic Data Center

For 1941 through 1980, monthly temperature and precipitation data were recorded for 130 nonurban
stations in the U.S. and Canada. These stations were selected because they provide reasonably
uniform spatial coverage of that area; consist of nonurban stations; have few missing daily and monthly
data; have experienced few station relocations; and have undergone little change in observation times.
These data were obtained from the archives of the National Climatic Data Center and the Canadian
Climate Centre. Included in the data are the station identification number, station name, state
abbreviation, province code, country code, station latitude and longitude, station population (1940,
1960, and 1980), name of observer, observing schedule code, time of observation bias codes, year,
monthly precipitation, mean temperatures, mean daily maximum temperatures, mean daily minimum
temperatures, and difference between the monthly mean daily maximum and minimum temperatures.
The data are in eight files [five data files (530 kB each), one station history file (56 kB), one station
inventory file (11.7 kB), and one file that lists the Canadian observers (7.9 kB)] and are available on
9-track magnetic tape only.

MAJOR WORLD ECOSYSTEM COMPLEXES RANKED BY CARBON IN LIVE VEGETATION: A
DATA BASE
J. S. Olson, J. A. Watts, and L. J. Allison
Oak Ridge National Laboratory

In 1980, this data base and the corresponding map were completed after more than 20 years of field
investigations, consultations, and analyses of published literature. They characterize the use and
vegetative cover of the Earth's land surface with a 0.5 degree x 0.5 degree grid. The data include
latitude, longitude, and vegetation code. This world-ecosystem-complex data set and the accompanying
map provide a current reference base for interpreting the role of vegetation in the global cycling of CO2
and other gases and a basis for improved estimates of vegetation and soil carbon, of natural
exchanges of CO2, and of net historic shifts of carbon between the biosphere and the atmosphere.
The data are in one file of 109 kB.

WORLDWIDE ORGANIC SOIL CARBON AND NITROGEN DATA
P. J. Zinke and A. G. Stangenberger
University of California at Berkeley
W. M. Post, W. R. Emanuel, and J. S. Olson
Oak Ridge National Laboratory

This data base was begun with the collection and analysis of soil samples from California. Additional
data came from soil surveys of Italy, Greece, Iran, Thailand, Vietnam, various tropical Amazonian
areas, and U.S. forests and from the soil-survey literature. The analyzed samples were collected at
uniform soil-depth increments and included bulk-density determinations. The data on each sample are
soil profile number; soil profile carbon content; soil profile nitrogen content; sampling site latitude and
longitude; site elevation; profile literature reference source; and soil profile codes for Holdridge life
zone, Olson ecosystem type, and parent material. These data may be used to estimate the size of the
soil organic carbon and nitrogen pools at equilibrium with natural soil-forming factors. The data are in
one file of 323 kB.

UNITED STATES HISTORICAL CLIMATOLOGY NETWORK (HCN) SERIAL TEMPERATURE AND
PRECIPITATION DATA
T. R. Karl, C. N. Williams, Jr., and F. T. Quinlan
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration

Extending through 1987, this data base contains monthly total precipitation and temperature data from
1219 stations in the contiguous U.S. To be included in the Historical Climatology Network (HCN), a
station had to be currently active (1987), have at least 80 years of monthly temperature and
precipitation data, and have experienced few station changes. These data were derived from a variety
of sources including the National Climatic Data Center archives, state climatologists, and published
literature. The data base contains several hundred variables, including state number; station number;
monthly temperatures (minimum, maximum, and mean); total monthly precipitation; and time of
observation. This is probably the best monthly temperature and precipitation data set available for the
contiguous U.S. because station moves, instrument changes, urbanization effects, and time-of-
observation differences have been considered and, where necessary, the data have been corrected.
The data are in 13 files [one station inventory file, one station history file, six temperature files, one
precipitation file, one time-of-observation correction file, and two quality-assessment files]. The file
sizes range from 5 kB to approximately 50 MB and are available on 9-track magnetic tape and CD-
ROM only.

AN UPDATED GLOBAL GRID POINT SURFACE AIR TEMPERATURE ANOMALY DATA SET:
1851-1988

H. F. Diaz
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration

This document presents monthly surface air temperature anomalies (departures from a 1951-1970
reference period mean) on a 5 degree latitude by 10 degree longitude global grid. The data were
derived primarily from the World Weather Records and the archives of the United Kingdom
Meteorological Office. This long term temperature anomaly record may be used in studies addressing
possible CO2 induced climate changes. To date, the data have been employed in generating
hemispheric and global time series for determining whether recent (post-1900) warming trends have
taken place.

All data have been assessed for quality (gross accuracy and consistency, temporal variability, and
spatial and temporal completeness of record), and for long-term homogeneity. Although the period of
record is from 1851 to 1988, few grid point locations have contributed data for the entire period of
record.

The NDP consists of this document and a magnetic tape containing machine-readable files. This
document provides sample listings of temperature anomalies, station numbers, mean inverse distance
data, as well as a complete listing of the gridded surface air temperature anomalies on microfiche
(Appendix B). This document also offers retrieval program listings (in FORTRAN and SAS languages),

HISTORICAL SUNSHINE AND CLOUD DATA IN THE UNITED STATES
P. M. Steurer and T. R. Karl
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
National Climatic Data Center

This data base presents monthly sunshine data from 240 U.S. stations (including Puerto Rico and nine
Pacific Islands) and monthly cloud amount data from 197 U.S. stations. The longest periods of record
are 1891 through 1987 for the sunshine data and 1871 through 1987 for the cloud data. The sunshine
data were derived from measurements taken by a variety of sunshine-recording instruments. The cloud
data were derived from land-based estimates of fractional cloud amount, which were made with
observation practices that have varied during the period of record. Station number, station name,
latitude, and longitude are given for all stations in each network. The sunshine data include monthly
and annual total hours of recorded sunshine, monthly and annual maximum possible hours of
sunshine, monthly and annual percentages of possible sunshine (hours recorded/hours possible), and
dates of use for specific types of sunshine recorders at each station. The cloud data contain monthly
and annual cloud amount (in percent of sky cover). The sunshine data are in four files: one station
inventory (34.1 kB), one monthly and annual hours of measured sunshine (1.6 MB), one monthly and
annual maximum possible hours of sunshine (21.5 kB), and one monthly and annual percentage of
possible sunshine (2.1 MB). The cloud data are in two files: one station inventory (20.4 kB) and one
monthly and annual cloud amount (2.4 MB). All files are available on 9-track magnetic tape only.

GLOBAL AND HEMISPHERIC ANNUAL TEMPERATURE VARIATIONS BETWEEN 1854 AND
1991
P. D. Jones, T. M. L. Wigley, and P. B. Wright
University of East Anglia

This data set contains estimates of global and hemispheric annual temperature variations, relative to
a 1950 through 1979 reference period, for 1854 through 1991. The estimates are based on corrected
land and ocean data. Land data were derived from meteorological data and fixed-position weather-ship
data that were corrected for nonclimatic errors, such as station shifts and/or instrument changes. The
marine data used were those in the Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (COADS)
compilation, which with updates covers to 1986. Updates to 1991 were made with hemispheric sea-
surface temperature estimates produced by the U.K. Meteorological Office. Each record includes year
and six annual temperature variations: one estimate each for the globe, the Northern Hemisphere, and
the Southern Hemisphere and another estimate each that reflects an adjustment to account for the
influence of El Nino/Southern Oscillation events. The data are in one file of 5.8 kB.

National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration

For 1958 through 1986, this data base presents total ozone variations and layer mean ozone variations
expressed as percent deviations from the 1958 to 1977 mean. The total ozone variations were derived
from mean monthly ozone values published in Ozone Data for the World by the Atmospheric
Environment Service in cooperation with the World Meteorological Organization. The layer mean ozone
variations are derived from ozonesonde and Umkehr observations. The data records include year,
seasonal and annual total ozone variations, and seasonal and annual layer mean ozone variations.
The total ozone data are for four regions (Soviet Union, Europe, North America, and Asia); five climatic
zones (north and south polar, north and south temperate, and tropical); both hemispheres; and the
world. Layer mean ozone data are for four climatic zones (north and south temperate and polar) and
for the stratosphere, troposphere, and tropopause layers. The data are in two files [seasonal and year-
average total ozone (13.4 kB) and layer mean ozone variations (24.2 kB)].

MONTHLY MEAN PRESSURE RECONSTRUCTIONS FOR EUROPE (1780-1980) AND NORTH
AMERICA (1858-1980)
P. D. Jones, T. M. L. Wigley, and K. R. Briffa
University of East Anglia

Real and reconstructed measurements of monthly mean pressure data have been constructed for
Europe for 1780 through 1980 and North America for 1858 through 1980. The reconstructions use
early pressure, temperature, and precipitation data from a variety of sources including World Weather
Records, meteorological and national archives, circulation maps, and daily chart series. Each record
contains the year, monthly mean pressure, quality code, and annual mean pressure. These
reconstructed gridded monthly pressures provide a reliable historical record of mean sea-level
pressures for Europe and North America. The data are in two files: pressure reconstructions for Europe
(1.47 MB) and for North America (0.72 MB).

With some data from as early as 1930, global long-term monthly and/or seasonal total cloud cover,
cloud type amounts and frequencies of occurence, low cloud base heights, harmonic analyses of
annual and diurnal cycles, interannual variations and trends, and cloud type co-occurrences have been
compiled and presented in two atlases (Warren et al. 1988, 1990). These data were derived from land
and ship synoptic weather reports from the SPOT archive of the Fleet Numerical Oceanography Center
(FNOC) and from Release 1 of the Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (COADS) for the
years 1930-1979. The data are in 12 files (one containing latitude, longitude, land-fraction, and number
of land stations for grid boxes; four containing total cloud, cloud types, harmonic analyses, and
interannual variations and trends for land; four containing total cloud, cloud types, harmonic analyses,
and interannual variations and trends for oceans; one containing first cloud analyses for the first year
of the GARP Global Experiment (FGGE); one containing cloud-type co-occurrences for land and
oceans; and one containing a FORTRAN program to read and produce maps). These files range in
size from 12.5 kB to 5.67 MB and are available on 9-track magnetic tape and CD-ROM only.

University of Washington, Seattle

Radiocarbon data for the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans were obtained between 1972 and 1977
as part of the Geochemical Ocean Section Study (GEOSECS) cruises during which more than 2200
water samples were collected. Some Mediterranean Sea data were also collected. Samples for 14C
were collected at 124 stations, and approximately 18 samples were collected at each station from
intervals throughout the water column. The data included in the data base are ship position (latitude
and longitude), sample number, depth, potential temperature, salinity, and delta 14C. The GEOSECS
data sets allow a better understanding of large-scale oceanic transport and mixing and the
establishment of the gross rate of deep-ocean circulation. The data are in three files (radiocarbon data
for the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Oceans) ranging in size from 39.9 to 50.4 kB.

CARBONATE CHEMISTRY OF THE WEDDELL SEA
C.-T. A. Chen
Oregon State University

In the late austral winter of 1981, carbonate data were obtained from the Weddell Sea as part of the
U.S.U.S.S.R. Weddell Polynya Expedition (WEPOLEX-81). Both surface samples and vertical-station
samples were taken. The data include ship position (latitude and longitude), date, station number,
sample depth, salinity, water temperature, pH, normalized surface total alkalinity, and calcium. These
data represent the first comprehensive carbonate data obtained in the Weddell Sea during late winter.
Because of the importance of the Weddell Sea as a source of deep water for the world's oceans, these
data have improved the understanding of the oceanic circulation of excess CO2 in the carbon cycle.
The data are in two files [one for data from surface stations (15.5 kB) and one for data from vertical
stations (5.9 kB)].

Carbonate chemistry data from 41 stations in the North Pacific Ocean were obtained during two NOAA
CO2 Dynamics Cruises (June-July 1981 and May-June 1982) and two legs of the NORPAX Hawaii-
Tahiti Shuttle Experiment (April 1979 and March-April 1980). The data for each sample include ship
position (latitude and longitude), date, station number, sample depth, salinity, water temperature, pH,
normalized total alkalinity, and normalized calcium. The data from each of the three cruises are in
separate files ranging in size from 7.1 kB to 10.1 kB.

GLOBAL, REGIONAL, AND NATIONAL CO2 EMISSION ESTIMATES FROM FOSSIL FUEL
BURNING, CEMENT PRODUCTION, AND GAS FLARING: 1950-1990
G. Marland and T. A. Boden
Environmental Sciences Division
Oak Ridge National Laboratory

For 1950 through 1990, global, regional and national annual estimates of CO2 emissions from fossil-
fuel burning, gas flaring, and cement production were calculated from energy statistics compiled by
the U.N. Statistical Office, cement manufacturing data compiled by the U.S. Bureau of Mines, and gas
flaring data provided by the U.N. and the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration.
The resulting data base offers annual global, regional, and national CO2 emission estimates for
1950-1990. All emission estimates are broken down by fuel type (i.e., solid, liquid, and gas fuels).
Emission estimates are provided for over 200 countries. Per capita estimates are also provided and
are derived from U.N. population statistics. In addition to the three files containing the global, regional,
and national emission estimates, the data base also provides all the statistics used to generate the
emission estimates. These statistics are provided in five files (three for the U.N. energy statistics; one
for the Bureau of Mines cement data; and one containing the gas flaring estimates taken from the UN
and DOE). Collectively, all files require 45.5 MB of space.

From 1868 through 1986, the average monthly snowfalls for 286 U.S. stations were extracted from the
Local Climatological Data Annual Summary. Only stations operating in 1986 and having a minimum
of 3 years data and at least 1 month on record with snowfall greater than a trace (>0.05 in.) were
included in the record. The data contain the station name, number of years of data used to estimate
the average monthly snowfall, average monthly snowfall, and annual snowfall. The monthly average
snowfall data for 286 U.S. stations are in one 46.4-kB file.

Monthly mean surface temperature and pressure data for 30 Antarctic stations (the earliest beginning
in 1903 and all extending through 1988) were assembled primarily from World Weather Records and
Monthly Climatic Data for the World. The data were assessed for quality and long-term homogeneity.
The data presented are station name, station latitude and longitude, station elevation, first and final
year of data record, year, mean monthly sea-level or station-level pressure, and mean monthly surface
temperature. The data are in four files (two temperature and two pressure data files) ranging in size
from 25 to 43 kB.

ATMOSPHERIC CO2 CONCENTRATIONS DERIVED FROM FLASK SAMPLES COLLECTED AT
U.S.S.R.-OPERATED SAMPLING SITES
A. M. Brounshtein, E. V. Faber, and A. A. Shashkov
Main Geophysical Observatory

This document presents daily atmospheric CO2 concentrations from four U.S.S.R.-operated sampling
sites (Teriberka Station, Ocean Station Charlie, Bering Island, and Kotelny Island). The period of
record varies by station with the earliest measurements dating back to 1983 and recent estimates from
early 1991. These CO2 concentrations are derived from air samples collected in 1.5-L stainless steel
electropolished flasks and later analyzed at the Main Geophysical Observatory (St. Petersburg,
U.S.S.R.) using a nondispersive infrared gas analyzer. Measurements not meeting wind direction, wind
speed, inter-flask agreement, and climate condition criteria were either discarded or flagged. All
measurements have been corrected for drift biases introduced during flask storage.

These atmospheric CO2 concentrations are considered indicative of regional background air conditions
and are directly traceable to the World Meteorological Organization's primary CO2 standards. These
measurements support the rising trend in atmospheric CO2 concentrations measured at other
monitoring sites around the world and may be compared with similar measurements made by various
monitoring programs at other northern latitude sites.

These atmospheric CO2 concentrations are available free-of-charge as a numeric data package (NDP)
from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC). The NDP consists of this document and
a magnetic tape (or floppy diskette) containing machine-readable data files for each station, a
descriptive file, and computer codes to access the data files. The document presents the atmospheric
CO2 concentrations in graphical and tabular form, describes the sampling methods, defines limitations
and restrictions of the data, and describes the information on the magnetic media.

ATMOSPHERIC CO2 CONCENTRATIONS - THE CANADIAN BACKGROUND AIR POLLUTION
MONITORING NETWORK
N. B. A. Trivett
Environment Canada

Flask air samples collected at roughly weekly intervals at three Canadian sites [Alert, Northwest
Territories (July 1975 through October 1987); Sable Island, Nova Scotia (June 1975 through October
1987); and Cape St. James, British Columbia (May 1979 through October 1987)] were analyzed for
CO2 concentration with the measurements directly traceable to the WMO primary CO2 standards.
Each record includes the date, atmospheric CO2 concentration, and flask classification code. They
provide an accurate record of CO2 concentration levels in Canada during the past decade. Because
these data are directly traceable to WMO standards, this record may be compared with records from
other Background Air Pollution Monitoring Network (BAPMoN) stations. The data are in three files (one
for each of the monitoring stations) ranging in size from 3.2 to 12.8 kB.

A GLOBAL GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM DATA BASE OF STORM OCCURRENCES
AND OTHER CLIMATIC PHENOMENA AFFECTING COASTAL ZONES
K. R. Birdwell
Murray State University (Kentucky)
R. C. Daniels
Miami University of Ohio

This NDP quantifies the occurrence of synoptic storms and other climatological factors that affect
coastlines (e.g., induce erosion or contribute to coastal inundation). This NDP is unique in that it
represents CDIAC's first offering of ARC/INFO export data files and equivalent flat ASCII data files that
may be used by raster or vector geographic information systems (GISs). The data set contains 61
variables, including information on tropical storms, hurricanes, super typhoons, extratropical
cyclogeneses, polar lows, cyclonicity, influence of winds in monsoon regions, and sea-ice
concentrations. Increased availability of source data has made it possible to extend the area of these
data variables to regional or global coverages. All data variables except five are referenced to 1 degree
x 1 degree or 5 degree x 5 degree grid cells of latitude and longitude. These data help meet the
demand for new and improved climatologies of storm events and may be used in climate research
studies, including the verification of general circulation models and the calculation of storm- recurrence
intervals.

The NDP consists of a written report and a 9-track magnetic tape containing 34 files, including eight
ARC/INFO files, flat ASCII files, and FORTRAN and SAS retrieval routines; a vector coordinate file;
and a descriptive file. The data files range in size from 0.1 kB to 5.31 MB. For those wishing to receive
these data on floppy diskettes, CDIAC will provide all except the ARC/INFO files on IBM-format, high-
density 5.25- or 3.5-in. diskettes.

This data set presents 14C activities from water samples taken at various locations and depths in the
Indian and Southern oceans through the Indien Gaz Ocean (INDIGO) project. These data were
collected as part of the INDIGO 1, INDIGO 2, and INDIGO 3 cruises, which took place during the years
1985, 1986, and 1987, respectively. These data have been used to estimate the penetration of
anthropogenic CO2 in the Indian and Southern oceans. The records include the station, date, ocean
bottom depth, latitude and longitude, sampling depth, potential temperature, salinity, density, total CO2,
13C, and 14C activity. The data are in one file of 25 kB.

This data set contains results from field CO2-enrichment experiments conducted over five consecutive
growing seasons, 1983-1987. These results comprise data concerning the effects of continuous CO2
enrichment on the growth of cotton under optimal and limiting levels of water and nitrogen. Unlike
many prior CO2 enrichment experiments in growth chambers or greenhouses, these studies were
conducted on field-planted cotton at close to natural conditions using the open-top chamber approach.
Measurements were made on a variety of crop response variables at intervals during the growing
season and upon crop harvest. The 1983 experiment was conducted on a lysimeter field at the U.S.
Water Conservation Laboratory, Phoenix, Arizona, whereas the experiments during the four
subsequent years were conducted at a site near the Western Cotton Research Laboratory, Phoenix,
Arizona. The initial experiment examined the effects of varying CO2 concentration only. In the following
two seasons, the interactive effects of CO2 concentration and water availability were studied. In the
final two seasons, the effects of the three-way interaction between CO2 concentration, water
availability, and nitrogen fertility were investigated.

The data comprise three types of information: identification variables (such as year, institution and site
codes, and treatment regimens), intermediate growth measurements (such as plant height, leaf area
index, number of flowers, and dry weight of leaves) taken at various times during the growing season,
and crop harvest results (such as lint yield, seed yield, and total aboveground dry biomass).

These data will be useful for elucidating the possible future effects on crop production of a doubling
of global atmospheric CO2 concentrations and for validating crop growth models designed to predict
the effects of elevated CO2 on cotton growth. The data show that, for all five growing seasons and all
experimental treatments (water-stresses or well-watered, low-nitrogen or high-nitrogen), cotton yields
and plant dry weights were increased significantly by CO2 enrichment.

This data set presents monthly averages and sampling statistics for atmospheric methane
concentrations from measurements made by the global cooperative flask sampling network of the
National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration/Climate Monitoring and Diagnostic Laboratory
(NOAA/CMDL) from 1983 through 1988. The data are derived from a network of 30 stations (26 of
which were still active at the end of 1988), which collected flask air samples approximately once per
week for measurement of both methane and CO2. The samples were analyzed for atmospheric
methane concentration on a gas chromatograph (fitted with a flame ionization detector) at the
NOAA/CMDL laboratory in Boulder, Colorado. The data consist of station identification code; year; and
mean monthly methane concentration, standard deviation, and number of samples contributing to the
mean for each month. The data are in one file of 66.5 kB.

TWO LONG-TERM INSTRUMENTAL CLIMATIC DATA BASES OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF
CHINA
Tao Shiyan, Fu Congbin, Zeng Zhaomei, Zhang Qingyun
Chinese Academy of Sciences (Beijing)

Two long-term instrumental data bases containing meteorological observations from the People's
Republic of China (PRC) are described. These data sets were compiled in accordance with a joint
research agreement signed by the United States Department of Energy (DOE) and the PRC Chinese
Academy of Sciences (CAS) on August 19, 1987. CAS has provided records from 265 stations,
partitioned into networks of 60 and 205 stations which each provide good geographical coverage of
the PRC. The 60-station network data contain monthly measurements of barometric pressure, air
temperature, precipitation amount, relative humidity, sunshine duration, cloud amount, wind direction
and speed, and number of days with snow cover. Detailed station histories are presented for all 60
stations. The 205-station network data contain monthly mean temperatures and monthly precipitation
totals; however, station histories are not currently available. Sixteen stations from these data sets (13
from the 60-station, 3 from the 205-station) have temperature and/or precipitation records which begin
prior to 1900, whereas the remaining stations began observing in the early to mid 1900s. Records from
262 stations extend through 1988; the remaining three station records extend through the early 1980s.

These data can be used in defining regional climate changes, establishing relationships between
regional and large-scale climates, and in studying the climatic impacts of urbanization and increased
concentrations of greenhouse gases. Additional uses could include examining impacts of periodic
events such as volcanic eruptions or the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO). These data sets
represent the most comprehensive, long-term instrumental Chinese climate data presently available.

Interest in global climate change has risen dramatically during the last several years. In a similar
fashion, the number of data sets available to study global change has also increased. Unfortunately,
these data sets have been compiled by many different organizations/researchers, making it confusing
and time consuming for individual researchers to acquire the "best" data.

In response to this rapid growth in the number of global data sets, the Carbon Dioxide Information
Analysis Center (CDIAC) and the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) commenced the Global
Historical Climatology Network (GHCN) project. The purpose of this project is to compile an improved
global base-line data set of long-term monthly mean temperature, precipitation, sea level pressure, and
station pressure for a dense network of worldwide meteorological stations. Specifically, the GHCN
project seeks to consolidate the numerous pre-existing national-, regional-, and global-scale data sets
into a single global climate data base that can be updated, enhanced, and distributed at regular
intervals.

The first version of the GHCN data base was completed during the summer of 1992. It contains 6039
temperature, 7533 precipitation, 1883 sea level pressure, and 1873 station pressure stations. All
stations have at least 10 years of data, 40% have more than 50 years of data, and 10% have more
than 100 years of data. The majority of stations have fairly complete records (72% are missing less
than 10% of their data). Furthermore, 80% of all station records continue into the 1980s or 1990s.
Spatial coverage is good over most of the globe, particularly for the United States and central Europe.
In comparison to other major global data sets, dramatic improvements are evident over South America,
Africa, and Asia.

The GHCN data base has been subjected to a large amount of quality control. For example, all
impossibly extreme values have been set to missing. In addition, all stations (some 17,000) were
plotted and visually inspected for "gross" data processing errors and discontinuities, all of which are
documented in the data base itself.

At this point, the GHCN data base is considered to be one of the best long-term climate data sets
available for the study of global climate change. Furthermore, the data base will continue to evolve in
the coming years. Planned improvements entail the inclusion of additional data, the correction of
erroneous data, the adjustment of data inhomogeneities, the addition of new variables, and the
production of gridded data sets.

This package consists of a data base containing daily observations of maximum and minimum
temperature and precipitation amounts at 138 U.S. stations. These stations are a specially chosen
subset of the 1219-station U.S. Historical Climatology Network (HCN), which was compiled by the
National Climatic Data Center (Asheville, North Carolina) and is contained in NDP-019/R1. The daily
data network (referred to as the HCN/D) consists of stations considered to be the best of those in the
HCN, selected to provide effective coverage of the contiguous U.S. after considering the temporal
homogeneity of each station's observing times, instrument positioning, and surroundings. The data for
each station extend through 1987, and most station records are complete for at least 80 years. The
daily resolution of these data lends maximum flexibility for studies attempting to detect and monitor
long-term climatic changes on a regional scale. The data are contained in seven files (one station-
inventory file, one station-history file, and five temperature and precipitation data files). The files range
in size from 10 kB to approximately 31 MB and are available via FTP and on 9-track magnetic tape
only.

Environmental Sciences Division

This data base may be used by raster or vector geographic information systems (GIS) and non-GIS
data bases to assess the risk of coastlines to erosion or sea level rise. The data base integrates point,
line, and polygon data for the U.S. East Coast into 0.25 degree latitude by 0.25 degree longitude grid
cells. Each coastal grid cell contains data on geology, geomorphology, elevation, wave heights, tidal
ranges, shoreline displacement (erosion), and sea-level trends.
To allow for the identification of coastlines at risk from coastal erosion or sea level rise, 7 of the 22
original variables in this data base were classified and used to create 7 relative risk variables. These
relative risk variables may be used to calculate a coastal vulnerability index for each grid cell. The data
for the 22 original variables and 7 risk variables, for a total of 29 data variables, have been placed into
the following data groups:

(1)  Gridded poygon data for the 22 original data variables. Data include elevations, geology,
     geomorphology, sea-level trends, shoreline displacement (erosion), tidal ranges, and wave
     heights.

(2)  Supplemental data for the stations used in calculating the sea-level trend and tidal range data
     sets.

(3)  Gridded polygon data for the seven classified risk variables. The risk variables are classified
     versions of the following data variables: mean coastal elevation, geology, geomorphology, local
     subsidence trends, mean shoreline displacement, maximum tide range, and the maximum
     significant wave height.

This data base consists of several ARC/INFO export files and flat ASCII data files (provided to extend
the use of the data to non-ARC/INFO users) with the data placed into 0.25 x 0.25 degree grid cells of
latitude and longitude. A 1:2,000,000 digitized coastline of the U.S. East Coast, FORTRAN and SAS
retrieval files, and a descriptive file have also been provided.

This data base presents the results of surface water and atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous
oxide (N2O) measurements carried out by shipboard gas chromatography over the period 1977-1990.
These data include results from 11 different oceanic surveys for a total of 41 expedition legs.
Collectively, they represent a globally distributed sampling that includes locations in the Atlantic,
Pacific, Indian, and Southern Oceans, as well as the Mediterranean and Red Seas.The
measurements were made by an automated high-precision shipboard gas chromatographic system
developed during the late 1970s and used extensively over the intervening years. This instrument
measures CO2 by flame iozionation after quantitative reaction to methane in a stream of hydrogen.
Nitrous oxide is measured by a separate electron capture detector. The chromatographic system
measures 196 dry-gas samples a day, divided equally among the atmosphere, gas equilibrated with
surface water, a low-range gas standard, and a high range gas standard.
These data constitute one of the most extensive records available of CO2 and, particularly, N2O in
marine air and surface seawater. The data will be valuable in modeling applications dealing with the
ocean's role in the global cycles of carbon and nitrogen, in studies of ocean-atmospheric dynamics,
and in studies evaluating other methodologies for determining pCO2.
All data have been assessed for quality and consistency and have been edited to remove serious
outliers and contaminated samples and to correct gross numerical errors.

series expands the coverage of sites recording atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2)
and methane (CH4), and it updates records reported in the first issue. New data for other atmospheric
trace atmospheric gases have been included in this issue: historical data on nitrous oxide (N2O) from
ice cores, modern records of atmospheric concentrations of chlorofluorocarbons (CFC-11 and CFC-12)
and N2O, and estimates of global emissions of CFC-11 and CFC-12. The estimates for global and
national CO2 emissions from fossil fuel burning, cement production, and gas flaring have been revised
and updated. Regional CO2 emission estimates have been added, and long-term temperature records
have been updated and expanded.

This data base offers an expanded and updated compilation of long-term station precipitation data,
together with a new set of gridded monthly mean fields for global land areas. This data set contains
5328 station records of monthly total precipitation, covering the period from the mid-1800s to the late
1980s. The station data were individually tested and visually inspected for the presence of spurious
trends, jumps and other measurement biases. The quality control procedure which was used to check
the station records for non-climatic discontinuities and other biases are detailed in a technical report
that accompanies this data base.
The station data were interpolated onto a 4 degree latitude by 5 degree longitude uniform grid.
Comparisons of these data with two other global-scale precipitation climatologies were done and are
discussed in the technical report that accompanies this data base.

This directory contains the input files used in simulations of atmospheric CO2 using the GISS 3-D
global tracer transport model. Sixteen files are provided in the directory including a help file
(CO2FUNG.HLP), twelve files containing monthly exchanges with vegetation and soils (CO2VEG.JAN
..... .DEC), one file containing releases of CO2 from fossil fuel burning (CO2FOS.MRL), one file
containing releases of CO2 from land transformations (CO2DEF.HOU), and one file containing the
patterns of CO2 exchange with the oceans (CO2OCN.TAK).

<h1>CD-ROM Drives and <a href="#section 2">Recorders</a></h1>

<h2>CD-ROM Drives</h2>

The most highly recommended drive is the Toshiba 3401. It is a very fast and very
reliable drive. It is reasonably priced, but you will also need to buy a SCSI controller.
<p>
The NEC CD-ROM drives 336,37,73,74,83, etc. have received many favourable
recommendations.

  The NeXT CD-ROM is a Sony CDU-541.
  The Sony CDU-6211 is the same as the Sony CDU-7211.
</pre>
A <strong>caddy</strong> is a special container for the CD-ROM before they go into the CD player.
It makes changing of the disc slightly more elaborate but protects the CD-ROM.
Use of a CD-ROM caddy is highly recommended during transport and operation. In
fact every CD-ROM deserves its own caddy because it limits the amount of physical
contact with the disc.

A <strong>jukebox</strong> is a system with one drive containing a number of discs. The machine
automatically changes discs on request. Because of unacceptable response times a
jukebox is not useful in a multi-tasking environment.
<p>
There is a German firm called NSM that sells CD-jukeboxes for bars, etc. They have
their fast 100-disk changer also available for consumer purposes and a CD-ROM
version. In Holland it is sold by:

A <strong>multi-drive</strong> is a system with several drives in one box.
<p>
A CD has an "index" area which contains track details; this is what is read when you
first stick an audio CD into a player. Photo-CDs have a separate index area each
time they are written (because it is impossible to "update" the index area). A
<strong>multisession</strong> drive is one that knows to look for multiple index areas. The full details
are contained in the Philips/Sony/Kodak <a href="cd-family.html#orange book"><em>"Orange Book"</em></a> standard for writable CDs.
<p>
<i>Why are CD-ROM drives so slow?</i>
<p>
Compact discs were originally designed for music. When you are listening to "Willie
Nelson's Greatest Hits", you are accessing the data sequentially and at a very regular
speed. The only time you need to seek is when you decide to skip over a song, or
back up and listen to "Always on my Mind" one more time.
<p>
In order to fit as much music as possible onto the disc, the data is recorded at the
same linear density near the outer edge of the disc as it is near the center, so there
is more information in the outside tracks than in the inside tracks. In order to deliver
a steady rate of data, the linear velocity of the disc moving under the head is
constant, so the angular velocity of the disc changes when the head moves from the
center toward the outside tracks. This is no big deal when you are playing music, but
when you are trying to do random access to a CD-ROM, the need to accelerate and
decelerate the disc is the biggest obstacle to making it faster. Most magnetic discs
spin at a constant angular velocity, so the data density decreases toward the outside
of the disk, but seeks are faster.
<p>
A few other reasons that CD-ROMs are slow: Optical disc heads tend to be heavier
than magnetic disk heads, so they have more inertia, and take longer to stabilize onto
a new track. Many CD-ROMs contain too much data to make effective use of RAM
caches.
<p>
As time goes by, CD-ROM drives will get a little faster, but don't expect any miracles.

Tim Sullivan, the most recent NEW MEDIA magazine compares over twenty CD
Writing systems. The best in the world is the quadruple speed Yamaha writer.
The worst are the JVC XRW1001 and others OEM'ed from it (Pinnacle RCD-202). All
the rest range between those two.
The big key is not just the mechanism but the mastering software, so keep that in
mind.
<p>
All CD-ROM recorders:
<ul>
<li>    can create all types of CDs (CD-audio, CD-ROM, CD-XA, PhotoCD and CD-I).
     They all can write previously recorded discs (multi session).
<li>    have a SCSI interface.
<li>    can be connected to all common system buses (ISA, EISA, MCA, Nubus)
</ul>
Exceptions are:
<ul>
<li>    Pinnacle Micro RCD 202: NO PhotoCD, NO CD-I
<li>    Ricoh RS 9200 CD: NO Nubus (Macintosh)
<li>    Yamaha PDS 301: NOT multisession, NO Nubus
</ul>
Kodak remarkets the Philips drive as their PCD Writer 200.
<p>
Pinnacle Micro announced at MacWorld Expo in San Francisco a new, recordable
CD-ROM drive with a list price of $3,995! This price includes ISO 9660 and HFS
software for Macs. PC interface kit and software is extra $200.
<p>
The JVC drive comes with software for making ISO-9660, Apple HFS, and hybrid
ISO-9660/HFS discs.
<p>
The blank discs for CD Recorders are not the same as a normal CD. The metal data
surface is gold instead of aluminum. The recorder uses a high powered laser to
modify a dye layer which is between the gold and the plastic. This dye is somewhat
photo sensitive so write once CDs should be stored in a dark place. They should be
stored in an area that does not rise above 40 Celsius (104 F). It takes about half an
hour to burn each disc.
<p>
The blanks come in two sizes. 63 minute, and 74 minute. The time refers to the
amount of digital audio that can be recorded. Since DA is read from the discs at a
constant rate of 150 kb/sec, it is easy to calculate the amount of data they will hold.
The 63' discs will hold about 580 meg, and the 74' discs will hold about 660 meg.
The discs cost about $20.

<h3>How much does it cost to make a CD-ROM?</h3>

You can get a master made for about $1300, and then about $1.50 per disc for
duplication. So to make 1000 discs, it will cost you about ($1300 + (1000 * 1.50)) =
$2800. Publishers often have `first-timer' specials with steep discounts off the list
price. For instance, DMI recently had a special of mastering, 50 discs, and two hours
of tech support for $750.
<p>
The cheapest CD-ROM manufacturer I've seen is Disc Manufacturing, Inc. Pre-
mastering $100 to $800, mastering $800 + $1.30/disk for 15-day turnaround.
Telephone Shogo Karitani at 205-859-4236
<p>
If you only want a few discs, you can have single ISO-9660 `one-offs' made for about
$200 for the first disc, and $100 for additional copies.

<h3>Short description</h3>

<hr>

The social demand for up-to-date maps and other reliable geographical
information products is growing rapidly. This is caused by the pressure of
urbanization, resource exploitation and management, and the development of
agriculture. Other influencing factors include the protection of the
environment and the need for security and political stability. At the same
time planning and decision making processes have become more and more
complex, and increasingly decentralized. This requires more, faster, more
current and specific geographical information on the one hand, and more
complex types of geographical information (correlation capacity for
interchanging information categories, models to indicate consequences of
actions, etc.) on the other. These demands are forcing national mapping
agencies to extend their range of activities to the supply of
geoinformation products in addition to traditional map production.<p>
The range of surveying and mapping tools is expanding rapidly as a result
of technological developments in the fields of computing,
telecommunication, expert systems, data bases, navigation and point
positioning systems, satellite technology and image processing. These new
integrated tools and techniques are either replacing or complementing
established technologies in map production. Their capacity and potential
capacity for serving the user community is revolutionizing traditional
disciplines.  <p>
Surveying and mapping organizations need qualified personnel to manage the
transition from existing to new and integrated technologies to meet the
growing demand for geoinformation.  <p>
ITC's response to this challenge is to contribute to the training of such
personnel and thereby help strengthen the innovative, production and
management capabilities of the organizations concerned. Courses of a
disciplinary and an interdisciplinary nature are offered. The
interdisciplinary courses have been brought about by the integration of the
disciplines of aerial photography, photogrammetry, cartography, digital
remote sensing and computer science to create a new Department of
Geoinformatics.

student in industrial hygiene or a cognate discipline. Where an applicant does not have a
baccalaureate degree, experience may be substituted on the basis of two years of qualifying
experience for one year of undergraduate education. Membership as an Associate member is
limited to a maximum of five (5) years. An Associate member may serve on committees and vote
but may not be elected to the Board of Directors of the Association.
<P>
Section 6. <I>Unemployed Applicants.</I> An unemployed applicant who would otherwise
meet the criteria for Associate, Full, or Fellow member may be elected to those categories of
membership.

such persons as are particularly distinguished in the general field of industrial hygiene, or in a
closely related scientific field, who have made significant contributions to the industrial hygiene
profession. Honorary memberships shall be considered as purely honorary and requiring no dues;
an Honorary member may not vote on Association matters unless as a Full member in good
standing or as a Retired member.
<P>
Section 11. <I>Organizational Members.</I> The Board of Directors may approve as
Organizational members such organizations as may apply for this status. The dues for
Organizational members and the privileges of this class of membership shall be defined by the
Board of Directors. An Organizational member shall have no vote.
<P>
Section 12. <I>Applications.</I> Application for membership shall be made on forms approved
by the Board of Directors. 
<P>
Section 13. <I>Waiver.</I> In exceptional cases, the Board of Directors, by a three-fourths vote,

<P>
<H2>Strategic Center 2:  Public Policy</H2>
<B>Goal:  AIHA will become the recognized leader in the development of public policy
impacting the profession.</B>
<P>
<I><B>Factors:</B></I><BR>
<I><UL><LI>Discussions on reinvention of OSHA and NIOSH present both pros and cons. A
reduction in government involvement may result in less need for employers to hire occupational
health and safety professionals.  However, reduction might  increase the need for third-party
occupational health and safety professionals due to a lack of government resources.
<LI>The Republicans have maintained control of Congress at least through 1998, which will
place more pressure on "reinvention" of OSHA .</UL></LI></I>
<P>
<B>Outcomes 2A:</B>
2A1. Establish AIHA as the essential source for federal regulatory and legislative policy makers
by providing testimony on at least three legislative measures by December 1997. <BR>

issues by December 1997. <BR>
2A3. Position AIHA as the central source for establishing IH policy on 50 percent of the top ten
key issues affecting occupational health and safety by December 1997.<BR>
2A4. Establish a membership grassroots program that enlists the membership as a whole
 or on a partial basis in government affairs activities or issues at least three or more times by
December 1997.<BR>
2A5. Increase recognition of the IH profession in one federal legislative and two additional
federal regulatory measures by December 1998.
<HR>
<P>
<H2>Strategic Center 3: Volunteer  Resources</H2>
<B>Goal: AIHA will develop programs and services to enhance the ability of its membership
and leadership to achieve the strategic plan goals.</B>
<P>
<I><B>Factors:</B></I><BR>
<I><UL><LI>Because many  volunteers have less free time,  it is important to increase the
number of participating  volunteers and to use their time more effectively.
<LI>As industrial hygienists and environmental and safety specialists cross over in their roles,
the membership universe changes. 
<LI>Economic and political changes could have a negative impact on the size of AIHA's core
member universe thus reducing our ability to direct OSH issues proactively.
<LI>The national population continues to grow in diversity.
<LI>Globalization will continue to impact on AIHA membership.</UL></LI></I>
<P>
<B>Outcomes 3A, Membership:</B><BR>
3A1. Achieve a 6% increase in national members in 1997 and a 5% per year increase in national
members beginning in 1998.<BR>
3A2. Retain 90% of membership from 1996 through 1998.<BR>
3A3. Increase the numbers of female and minority members by 5% each a year.<BR>
3A4. By May 1998, 45% of the AIHCE exhibitors will be organizational members.
<P>
<B>Outcomes 3B, Leadership:</B><BR>
3B1. By 1997, the Nominating Committee will have a process to identify potential leaders for the
AIHA Board of Directors from a wider variety of the membership.<BR>
3B2. By 1998 80% of the technical committee leaders will attend the Leadership Workshop.
<P>
<B>Outcomes 3C. Local Sections:</B><BR>
3C1. National will determine the percentage of national members in each local section by July
1997.<BR>
3C2. National will develop a tiered services and program structure for local sections by January
1998.<BR>
3C3. By 1998, 80% of local sections will be represented at the leadership workshop.<BR>
3C4. Increase mutual memberships by 10%  per year over the 1996 base, starting in 1998. 
<P>
<B>Outcomes 3D, Special Interest Groups:</B><BR>
3D1.  By May 1997 establish three Special Interest Groups: one for consultants and two for
selected technical areas.
<HR>
<P>
<H2>Strategic Center 4: Fiscal Resources</H2>
<B>Goal: AIHA will manage its finances to ensure that it has the resources to meet and integrate
its strategic planning goals, business plans, and budget.</B>
<P>
<I><B>Factors:</I></B><BR>
<I><UL><LI>Changing societal, economic, and professional forces require setting boundaries
and
priorities in expenditure of resources.
<LI>When programs, committees, and other functions serve fewer people or deliver limited
results, the association must assess effectiveness and consider reallocating resources.   
<LI>The association must balance its resource allocation between meeting current needs and
meeting future needs.
<LI>The association derives a large portion of its annual revenues from the activities and output
of its technical committees.</UL></LI></I>
<P>
<B>Outcomes 4A, Financial Goals:</B><BR>
4A1. Member equity will be equivalent to 35% of annual revenue by 2000; 50% by 2010.<BR>

budget.<BR>
4A3. With 1995 as the base, identify 3 new non-dues revenue sources by 1998. <BR>
4A4. With 1995 as the base, increase total revenue by 10% by 1998.
<P>
<B>Outcome 4B, Product Development:</B><BR>
4B1. Increase productivity and revenues by providing additional financial resources for up to five
selected technical committees for a minimum of three years beginning in 1997. 
<HR>
<P>
<H2>Strategic Center 5: Image and Identity</H2>
<B>Goal: AIHA will be recognized by its external and internal customers as the essential source
for occupational health information, services, and resources, and will continue to promote the
expertise and value of the profession to appropriate publics.</B>
<P>
<I><B>Factors:</I></B><BR>
<I><UL><LI>The meaning of industrial hygiene and the industrial hygienist's role are not fully
understood by external publics, including employers, regulators, legislators, and members of the
community. 
<LI>With current economic and political climates, industrial hygienists need to impart the image
of a versatile, highly qualified and necessary professional.
<LI>Community involvement is an important tool for building recognition of a
profession.</UL></LI></I>
<P>
<B>Outcomes 5A:</B><BR>
5A1. IH status and recognition will grow at least 10% a year with allied professions and trade
press.<BR>

<BODY>
<H1><CENTER>REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE UNIFICATION TASK FORCE FOR AAIH, ABIH, ACGIH AND AIHA</CENTER></H1>
<HR>

                 
<H2>Executive Summary of the Report:</H2>

The Unification Task Force (UTF) was guided throughout its deliberations by its charge,
established during a meeting of the Boards of the American Academy of Industrial Hygiene
(AAIH), the American Board of Industrial Hygiene (ABIH), the American Conference of
Government Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), and the American Industrial Hygiene Association
(AIHA) in Kansas City, May, 1995:

<BLOCKQUOTE>
     "The Unification Task Force (UTF) is charged by the  Boards of Directors of the AAIH,
     ABIH, ACGIH, and AIHA with researching and analyzing all available background
     information and data in order to make recommendations to the four governing bodies
     regarding the efficacy of uniting the four organizations for the benefit of the profession
     and the respective members of the four organizations.<P>

     These recommendations may take the form of one or more proposals ranging from
     maintaining the status quo to any of a number of kinds of unification. The UTF will
     prioritize its recommendations/proposals and provide appropriate rationale and
     explanation for each of them.<P>

     The primary thrust of the UTF will be to determine what forms, if any, of unification are
     advisable and to describe them in sufficient detail topermit the respective organizations to
     fully evaluate the options and make appropriate decisions on each."<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

After establishing criteria for judging the efficacy of any recommendation, the UTF developed
and critically examined four models: the status quo, a cooperative model, a federated model and
a consolidated model.
<P>
At its final meeting, on April 2, 1996, the UTF unanimously recommended consolidation of the
four participating organizations.
<P>
The full report of their recommendations and the rationale for those recommendations follow. 
<P>

<H2>The Process:</H2>

When charged by the four Boards in May, 1995, the structure of the UTF was also decided. It
would consist of three representatives from each organization, for a total of 12.  The chief staff
officer of each organization was expected to attend each meeting, unless officially excused by
that organization. The chief staff officer served as a representative with voice but no vote.
<P>
Before the first meeting, the UTF selected Dadie Perlov, CAE, founder and principal of the
Consensus Management Group, as facilitator.
<P>
At the first meeting, all participants agreed to a process and ground rules, attached as <A HREF="utfa.html">Addendum
A</A>. They also agreed that the work of the UTF would focus on the best interests of the profession
of industrial hygiene, the individual industrial hygienist, workers and the community.
<P>
The definition of consensus, which is how all UTF decisions were reached, was defined as a
decision which most of the UTF could live with, with "most"  considered to be more than a
simple majority. In fact, the UTF revisited any recommendation which failed to receive a two-thirds positive vote.
<P>
The UTF met formally seven times, for two days each time, between October 1, 1995 and April
2, 1996, and completed many interim assignments and tasks between meetings.
<P>
For each meeting, an Executive Summary of proceedings was prepared, approved by the UTF
and shared with each Board.
<P>
For an interim meeting of all four Boards on March 17, 1996, these summaries were condensed
to focus on key UTF decisions to date. This material, plus presentations by UTF members on
mission, programs, image, public policy, and membership, as well as the structure and
governance of three different models, provided an opportunity for individual members of each
Board to give feedback to the UTF on over 100 items.  Analysis of responses, electronically
recorded through the use of individual key pads, helped guide the thinking of UTF members
when they were called upon to make final recommendations at their last meeting in April.
<P>
It should also be noted that despite regular communications to the members of each organization
via newsletters, very little formal feedback from members was received by any UTF member,
and virtually no mail was sent to the PO Box set up to confidentially receive opinions from
members of any of the participating organizations. On the plus side, there were several important
letters to editors of the ACGIH and AIHA newsletters.  Each received attention by the UTF.
<P>
The UTF also recognized that the best time to intervene in any system or process is before that
system or process is broken.  Therefore, the UTF continually asked itself, "Is what we are now
considering going to be better than the status quo for the individual industrial hygienist, for those
he/she serves, and/or for the profession?" 
<P>
To do this required a solid understanding of the status quo, and its use as a benchmark. As an
early task, the UTF created an extensive description of the status quo, referred to as a "<A HREF="utfgrid.html">Baseline Data Grid</A>". 
<P>
From the beginning of the UTF's work there was uniform recognition that none of the existing
organizations are now "broken".  All are in good health, working towards fulfillment of their
respective missions.  However, after making some reasonable assumptions about the future of the
profession and the environment in which it will function, it became clear that the profession
could be strengthened through certain fundamental changes.
<P>
<H2>Models Considered:</H2>

After agreement as to process, the establishment of baseline data, and a projection of the future,
both for the profession and the environment in which it would function, the UTF then:

<UL>
<LI>Developed a mission for an industrial hygiene professional association.
<LI>Determined criteria (<A HREF="utfb.html">Addendum B</A>) against which decisions were to be evaluated.
<LI>Decided which existing programs must be retained; which currently underway by more
than one association could be consolidated to eliminate undesirable redundancies; which
current programs and services might be eliminated; and which new programs and services
should be considered.
<LI>Examined the strongest possible ways to establish public policy.
<LI>Recognized the importance of attention to image and identity, for the profession and itsprofessional association(s).
<LI>Considered membership criteria, categories and entitlements, along with the roles,
rights and responsibilities of local sections.
</UL>

The UTF considered four basic models, recognizing that there were many permutations possible
within each model, and that some characteristics of a particular model could be transported in
whole or part to another model.
<P>
The four models considered were:
<P>
      The status quo<BR>
      A cooperative model<BR>
      A federated model<BR>
      A consolidated model<BR>

<P>
 For each, the UTF considered:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>      The possible structure(s) needed to advance the predetermined mission and
accommodate the programs, services, public relations and membership access already
established as important for the individual industrial hygienist and the profession. 
<LI>      The kind(s) of governance desired and required.
<LI>      Headquarters and staffing implications.
<LI>      How to finance each model, which resulted in the need to draft pro forma budgets for
each.
</UL>


The working mission created by the UTF was intended to drive all deliberations.  It was designed
to reflect why the association would be in business, and for whom it would be in business. The
mission statement used is:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
    "The 4IH Association will advance the occupational and environmental hygiene
    profession in protecting the health of workers and the surrounding communities."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
After receiving feedback from members of all four Boards at the March 17, 1995 meeting, and
reviewing all UTF decisions to date, it became clear that it was time to reject both the
cooperative and federated models. The polling did not produce a compelling case for either
model, nor could the UTF make a compelling case for either model.

<H3>The Cooperative Model:</H3>

This model represented a slightly more formal extension of the status quo, leaving all
organizations intact, but providing for an unincorporated Coordinating Council.  This Council
would encourage cooperative efforts in appropriate areas, e.g. the production of a combined
membership directory and the pursuit of ethics awareness.
<P>
Although this model would be the least disruptive to existing organizations, that was not a
sufficiently compelling reason to support it. The model was rejected because it created a new
layer of bureaucracy, required more meetings and an additional commitment of time for certain
Board members and staff of each of the participating organizations, with little apparent return for
either the individual industrial hygienist, the profession, or any of the participating organizations. 
Since the Coordinating Council would have no implicit authority, any decisions and requests for
funding or other resources would be open to second guessing by any Board.
<P>
Because accountability had a high value in all UTF deliberations, this model did not make the
grade. It essentially maintained the status quo, with no evidence that substantial improvements
could be expected.

<H3>The Federated Model:</H3>

This model is more complex, and received careful consideration. In essence, it enabled each
existing organization to maintain its identity and corporate status, adding a separately
incorporated "Managing Board" and professional staff for the Federation. Administrative
responsibilities of each participating organization would be transferred to the Federation. The
three existing incorporated entities, ABIH, ACGIH and AIHA would be joined by a fourth, the
Federation itself. In this model, the Academy would remain under the aegis of the ABIH.
<P>
While this structure had some decided advantages, including some cost savings, opportunities for
leadership development, and the consolidation of certain activities, e.g. the production of a single
membership directory, the coordination of all appropriate task forces and committees, and the
physical arrangements for travel, conferences and meetings, it also presented some major
problems. 
<P>
The federated model failed to eliminate non-productive competition for members, a current
reality for ACGIH and AIHA, and one which has the potential to escalate over the next few
years.  It failed to enable a sharpened focus on the image of the profession, and it would
significantly increase bureaucracy. Although much of each current organization would remain
intact, moving into a federation would still cause major disruption for a small return in monetary
savings or other member benefits.  The large number of fiscal contracts needed to enable a single
source of dues collection, i.e. at the Federation level, and the billing, collection and disbursement
of all moneys, was seen as problematic. 
<P>
Because each organization would retain autonomy, nothing would prevent any one of them from
utilizing the Federation less and less as time progressed.  Finally, the difficulty of having four
Executive Directors, with overlapping jurisdictions, was seen as a major management
impediment.  Despite the seductiveness of this option, and after a thorough analysis of the model,
it was not endorsed in the informal polling of the four Boards, or later by the UTF as it met to
make its final recommendations. Both the Boards and the UTF found that federation offered little
if any improvement in efficiency, effectiveness or net worth.  Equally important, the UTF felt
that membership would not perceive the federation as an organization that would add value to the
profession or to the individual member.
<P>
Overall, Federation was seen as no improvement over the status quo.  If anything, it ranked lower
than the status quo in all informal polling of the four Boards.  This reinforced a previous and
similar ranking by the UTF. 

<H3>The Status Quo:</H3>

Attention was then focused on the status quo and the consolidated model.  After careful review,
the UTF also rejected the status quo, and concentrated on creating the best possible consolidated
organization.
<P>
The status quo was rejected largely because there was increasing recognition that the future for
the industrial hygiene profession required concerted, unified attention to meeting the needs of
industrial hygienists and those they serve.  The competition for members, for advertising dollars
and for recognition as a legitimate source for information about the profession all pointed to the
need for a paradigm shift. Questions were also raised about the appropriateness of supporting
multiple headquarters and the attendant costs at a time when government, academe and industry
are all tightening operations. 
<P>
Analysis of the status quo indicated that substantial sums of money were being expended for
organizational maintenance and operations, money which could be shifted into programs and
services for the members or could be used to substantially reduce dues. The large number of
individuals who held multiple memberships was also a consideration.
<P>
A major driver for change was the growing recognition that the profession itself was in flux, with
people coming into it from more diverse sources and with more diverse roles for the industrial
hygienist of the future. As a relatively small profession, the need to consolidate resources,
political power, programs and services became apparent. 
<P>
Perhaps the most defining moment in the search for the UTF's final recommendation came
during a discussion of why the status quo might not be better for the ABIH.  Very quickly, the
UTF determined that being part of a consolidated organization, even as a programmatically
independent subsidiary, offered ABIH:
    
<UL>
<LI>      Easier access to the profession for promotion of the CIH
<LI>      Enhanced resources for ABIH to change IH certification as field practices change
<LI>      A higher level of coordination with the practicing profession 
<LI>      Cost effectiveness for the certification effort
<LI>      Reduced fees for certification maintenance
<LI>      Better communications within the industrial hygiene community
<LI>      Expanded use of technology, available through the consolidated organization
<LI>      Increased opportunity for ABIH to become an umbrella for new certification areas, the
cost of which could initially be underwritten by a financially secure consolidated organization. 
<LI>      Reduced dues for members who are CIHs and full participants in more than one
organization                            
<LI>      Advantages of "one stop shopping", i.e. one place to look for information, programs,
services, materials, positions, etc.
<LI>      Reduce perceptions of "elitism" which sometimes accrues to ABIH
</UL>

    
The awareness that all of those advantages of a consolidated organization could be achieved
while maintaining the integrity of the certification process, in accord with externally established
standards for a credentialing body, was encouraging.
<P>
The need to preserve the credibility of the certification process, extended as well to the
development of TLVs, BEIs and the lab accreditation program, all now accounted for in the
status quo. Once it was clear that all these activities could be securely protected and even
strengthened, along with absolute protection of their independence and credibility, the decision to
move forward towards consolidation was reinforced.  
<P>
<H3>Consolidation:</H3>

During its seventh and final meeting, the UTF unanimously voted to recommend
consolidation.  This was an outcome that could not have been predicted at the outset.  It
resulted from a deliberative process, progressively built,  based on careful attention to previously
determined criteria.  The criteria (<A HREF="utfb.html">Addendum B</A>) were objectively determined and established
before any models were proposed. 
<P>
Consolidation offers industrial hygienists the opportunity to focus their resources, efforts and
attention on programs, services and issues which will accomplish the proposed mission for the
consolidated organization, "..to advance the occupational and environmental hygiene profession
in protecting the health of workers and the surrounding communities".
<P>
This working mission drove the design of the consolidated organization which follows.  It
guided: 

<UL>
<LI>    Selection of programs and services
<LI>    Ongoing attention to "helping the industrial hygienist do his/her job"
<LI>    Considerable cost-saving and consequent reduction in the overall amount of dues dollars
paid by the profession
<LI>    Development of an approach to public policy initiatives which assures a strong voice for
the profession, enabling the organization to identify and address technical, professional and
political issues quickly and accurately, with due regard to diverse opinion and interests within the
profession
<LI>    Design of equitable membership categories and entitlements
<LI>    Utilization of "best practice" standards for the structure, governance and management of
the consolidated organization
</UL>

<A HREF="utfunite.gif">A graphic description of a consolidated organization for the industrial hygiene profession. </A>

<H2>Governance of the Consolidated Organization:</H2>

For the work of the UTF, governance was defined as a process within an organization which
provides the decision-making mechanisms needed to direct and accomplish the business of the
organization.  It is a political process created to determine policy and assure accountability to
members and the profession.
<P>
Recognizing that the effectiveness and efficiency of any organization depends largely on the
quality of governance and management, the consolidated organization was structured to enable
the best of both.
<P>
<H3>A)   The Board of Directors Role:</H3>

     The eleven person Board will be a policy Board.  That is, it will deal with setting the
     direction and tone for the organization.  It will focus on five key policy areas:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Establishing ends policies, generally called goals or priorities. This planning
     function generally includes ongoing assessment of the needs, wants and expectation of
     members and prospective members, related always to the realities of the external
     environment. 
<P>
     It keeps the organization mission driven and market sensitive.  It assures that the
     organization's plan, based on member interests and needs, guides all programs and
     services, from conferences and publications to public relations and local section support.
     It maintains organizational focus, even as administrations and staff change. 
<P>
<LI>Setting public policy, which requires two key elements: The advance
     identification of compelling issues and positions on behalf of which the organization
     could initiate action, and a system for appropriate response to issues raised externally. 
     The UTF used the matrix on the next page as a sample of a future way to determine the
     importance of any issue and the association's ability to impact it, to determine those
     issues which would receive priority attention.
<P>
     In the consolidated organization, where multiple workplace situations, professional
     interests, philosophies and experiences will influence public policy positions, it will be
     critical for the organization to seek consensus on major issues. The use of technology
     makes such a task eminently feasible. Readily available tools can widen the circle of
     input into the decision-making process.
<P>
     For issues which are highly important and have high impact potential, i.e. issues which
     would reside in quadrant A, it will be essential for the consolidated organization to have
     the ability to respond in a strong voice and in a timely manner. For those issues which
     reside in the B, C and D quadrants of the matrix, it will be necessary for the consolidated  organization to serve as a single source of credible information, but not necessarily as a single voice.  This will encourage and enable soliciting, expressing and explaining differing positions.
 <P>    
     Guidelines for how to establish and promulgate positions, to assure an open process and
     maximum impact, will be essential.
<P>
     A consolidated organization would be best able to affect public policy on the
     international and local levels as well. 
<P>
<LI>Resource allocation:  A fundamental policy role for the Board will be to allocate
     all resources to support all goals and public policies alreadyestablished.  These resources
     include money, human resources, technology and time. 
<P>
<LI>Executive Director relationship:  This Board role provides guidance to and
     evaluation of the Executive Director.  It assures that the chief staff officer has the
     competence to participate in public policy and planning deliberations, and to bring issues
     to the Board, while focusing on his/her primary role, i.e. carrying out all policy directives
     from the Board.
<P>
The above four policy roles all revolve around "what" the organization will do. There is one
important "how" which the association's Board would deal with:
<P>
<LI>How the Board governs: These actions identify the processes which the Board
     will follow in its deliberations.  It can cover everything from where the Board will meet
     to the rules of procedure, if not provided for in bylaws.
</OL>
<H3>B.   Board of Directors Composition:</H3>

     The Board will be composed of 11 members: 5 officers and 6 directors. 
<OL>
<LI>Officers:<BR>
          The Officers will be a President, President-Elect, Vice-President, Immediate Past
President and a Secretary/Treasurer. The President, President-Elect, the Vice-President and the Immediate Past President will each serve a one year term.
<P>
          The Secretary/Treasurer will serve one 2 year term.  To assure continuity, a
          Secretary/Treasurer-Elect will be elected during the second year of that term, and
          will serve as an ex-officio member of the Board for one year, and then assume a
          full 2 year term. 
<P>
     Officers will be eligible for re-election after 3 years off the Board.  For Officers who
     move into other officer positions, terms may be consecutive.
<P>
<LI>Executive Committee:<BR>

          For interim decisions between meetings of the Board, when those decisions
          cannot wait for a regular Board meeting, or cannot be accomplished through
          conference call, the Executive Committee may act on behalf of the Board.
<P>
          The officers would serve as the Executive Committee.
<P>
          It is generally the responsibility of the Executive Committee to provide for the
          annual evaluation of the Executive Director's performance. 
<P>
<LI>Directors:<BR>
          There will be 6 Directors, each elected for a single 3 year term.  Terms will be
          staggered so that each year 2 Directors are elected and seated.
<P>
          Directors will be eligible for re-election to the Board after 3 years off the Board.
<P>
          For Directors who move into officer positions, terms may be consecutive.
</OL>
<H3>C.   Committees and Task Forces:</H3>

     To assist the Board in advancing the organization's mission, and to focus on current and
     ongoing priorities, there will be both committees and task forces.
<OL>
<LI>Two Standing Committees are recommended:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Finance: To develop and monitor the organization's budgets, investments
          and funds.  This committee is generally chaired by the organization's
          Secretary/Treasurer, working closely with the Chief Financial Officer, a staff
          position, and the Executive Director. 
<P>
          Although this committee will in all likelihood begin its work by reviewing a draft
          budget created by staff, it helps the Board meet its fiduciary responsibilities and is
          generally  provided for in Bylaws. 
<P>
<LI>Nominating: This critical committee assures the identification,
          development and placement of leaders. After hearing from members of all four
          current Boards that this committee should be closely aligned with the grassroots
          membership, the UTF recommends a five member committee, all elected by the
          membership.
<P>
          Each year, the Nominating Committee will nominate a dual slate of candidates for
          service on the next Nominating Committee.  There will also be provision for
          petition candidates.
<P>
          The Immediate Past President of the organization will serve as Chair of the
          Nominating Committee, with voice but no vote. 
<P>
          For the first year of operation of the consolidated organization, the Immediate
          Past-Presidents of both the ACGIH and the AIHA would Co-Chair this
          Committee. 
<P>
          For the nomination of officers and board members, as well as members of the
          Nominating Committee, there will be guidelines which require that all slates
          reflect the diversity of the organization's membership. 
</UL>
<P>
<LI>Other Committees: The Board may wish to establish other Committees,
     particularly for matters which may require long-term attention, or which should be carried
     over from any of the existing membership organizations, e.g. certain technical
     committees, the committee which will oversee activities related to academic accreditation
     (currently the responsibility of AAIH/ABET), etc.
<P>
<LI>Task Forces: Most of the implementation activities which emerge from Board
     policy determinations will be carried out by time and task- specific Task Forces,
     supported by staff.  No Task Force will assume an "in perpetuity" role.  Task Forces will
     be accountable to the Board, reporting on progress to date vis a vis pre-determined
     benchmarks, useful in carrying out specific assignments in a timely manner. 
</OL>

<H2>Special Interest Groups (SIGs):</H2>

SIGs will be established to provide for the wide variety of special professional interests,
originating from the workplace (academe, government, chemical industry, etc.), specialty, or
interests which transcend a specific workplace, e.g. labor. 
<P>
It is envisioned that participation in one SIG might be included in base member dues. Fees for
participation in more than one SIG will need to be determined. Guidelines will spell out criteria
for starting a SIG, entitlements as a SIG member, staff support for SIGs, and the method of
setting participation fees.
<P>
SIGs can play an important role in developing public policy positions, as a first level of a
strategic planning process, and as grassroots entities which can keep member needs, wants and
expectations before the Board. 
<P>
SIGs meet a critical member need for networking opportunities, and along with committees and
task forces, also serve as training grounds for future leaders. 


<H2>Local Sections:</H2>

Attention to local sections will be important. Headquarters should be able to provide service to
all local sections which meet whatever minimum standards are mutually established for sections.
Local sections also provide leadership identification and training opportunities, have the entree
needed to carry national public policy initiatives to local officials, can attract and keep members,
and offer local programs of professional interest to members and prospective members. 
<P>
Unresolved by the UTF is the larger question of whether there should be co-extensive
membership required between national and its sections, i.e. should every member have to be, or
automatically become, a member of both the national and a local section.  This issue should be
on an early agenda for resolution.
<P>
State Government Affairs Organizations (SGAOs), currently active within AIHA in ten states,
are an entity that calls for expansion and investment.  With so many issues, such as licensure,
regulation and workplace legislation appearing on more and more state legislative agendas, the
SGAOs should become an increasingly active part of a consolidated organization's operations. 

<H2>Subsidiary Organizations:</H2>

Soon after the UTF began its task, it became apparent to all that certain activities and programs
required a high level of independence in order to assure the integrity and credibility of those
activities and programs.  The key programs which fell into this category were the development of
exposure guidelines, e.g. TLVs and BEIs; laboratory accreditation programs; and professional
certification. 
<P>
The UTF was determined to find a way to insulate these programs and activities from any undue
interference in the content of the programs and activities. Each of the new models considered
provided some degree of protection. The consolidated model ultimately offered the most,
including improvement over the status quo, by placing each of these activities into a subsidiary
corporation. The Board of each subsidiary will be totally independent of the parent organization
vis a vis who serves on the subsidiary Board, and as well as for the creation of programs and
products.
<P>
This was accomplished through the establishment of subsidiary corporations for creating
exposure guidelines, for certification, and for lab accreditation, as described in the following chart.
<P>
Subsidiaries are designed for programs and services which require independence to assure the integrity and credibility of those programs, services and products. Each subsidiary will have a staff director, who will report to the subsidiary board on all content matters, and dedicated staff to support programs. Administration and services will be purchased via contract from the parent organization. Royalty and other fiscal arrangements will be mutually determined between parent organization and subsidiary.

<H2>Membership in the Consolidated Organization:</H2>
Considerable attention was directed to providing equitable and defensible membership categories and benefits. The categories suggested below preserve the Diplomate status for CIH's; provide full Fellow status for all appropriately credentialled members of the profession; and enable non-degreed technicians and degreed nurses the ability to participate. Dues schedules were calculated to cover as much of the core costs of membership for most categories, with recognition that both students and retirees would continue to receive some membersgip support from the organization.

<H2>Key Activities of the Consolidated Organization:</H2>

UTF interest in the possibilities offered by unification was strengthened when programs and
services, as well as image and identity, were considered.  Again, this was always considered in
relation to the best interest of the profession of industrial hygiene and of the industrial hygienist,
with the overarching objective of workplace safety and health. 

<H3>A. Programs and Services:</H3>
<OL>
<LI>Programs to continue and strengthen, already reflected in the design and structure
     of the consolidated organization:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>A professional certification and re-certification program that promotes
          high technical standards, integrity and excellence in occupational health/industrial
          hygiene professionals so designated.
<LI>An academic accreditation program which approves and endorses those
          undergraduate and graduate collegiate curricula meeting desired technical,
          educational and professional standards.
<LI>A strong accreditation program for occupational health, safety and related
          environmental laboratories.
<LI>A premier, independent body and process to develop, evaluate and promulgate recognized national/international occupational exposure values and workplace guidelines.
<LI>A government affairs branch with strong legislative and regulatory
          lobbying capabilities.
<LI>A sought after resource for state and federal agencies.

          consolidation can avoid the competition for advertising apparent in the status quo,
          which in turn might make it possible to increase advertising rates; increase the
          number of scholarly submissions which in turn should improve quality of peer
          reviewed papers; maintain one editorial Board, reflective of membership).

</OL>

<H3>B.  Image and Identity:</H3>

    The consolidated organization will focus on both an internal image and identity (for
members and prospective members) and an external image and identity (for all other significant
publics). 
    <P>
    Identity was defined as, "What an organization is and does", while image was defined as,
"The perception of what the organization/profession is and does". 
<P>
    To assure the desired internal image and identity for members and prospects, the
organization will:
<OL>
<LI>"Help me do my job better."  This was seen as the fundamental issue.
<LI>Promote its members' professional status to employers, clients, government, academia
and other external interest groups.
<LI>Be the best source for continuing education and technical publications, on a consistent
basis.
<LI> Insure a meaningful certification program.
<LI> Have a governance structure that is sensitive to a diverse membership. 
<LI> Meet member needs.
<LI>Be responsive to technical and political issues, and be able to address those issues
through fast, flexible and accurate mechanisms.
<LI>Provide networking opportunities for special interest groups.
<LI>Maintain high professional standards for membership.    
</OL>

Some of the key external publics identified were the media, through which the public-at-large is
primarily reached; the government (legislators and regulators); allied professional societies;
employers and clients; and international publics.
<P>
    To assure the desired image and identity for external publics, the consolidated organization
will be recognized as:

<OL>
<LI>The authoritative experts in occupational and environmental hygiene.
<LI>The accrediting body working with ABET for professional and academic programs.
<LI>The certifying body for the occupational and environmental hygiene profession.
<LI>A proponent of the value of certification.
<LI>Active participants in public policy activities relevant to occupational and
environmental health, so as to "serve and protect" the profession.
<LI>Protectors of the occupational and environmental health of the workforce and the public.
<LI>A primary source of occupational standards and guidelines, worldwide.
</OL>

<H2>Pro Forma Budget:</H2>

In order to complete its rationale for recommending consolidation, the UTF gave serious time
and attention to the fiscal implications of this action. 
The approach taken in the pro forma budget, which is attached as <A HREF="utfc.html">Addendum C</A>,
was to be as conservative as possible in regard to income and as liberal as
possible in regard to expenses.  This approach guarantees that no promises are being made
through the pro forma budget which cannot be actualized in the early years of operation.
<P>
It is important to note that the one time costs for consolidation will be about 
$ 1,125,000.  This figure was seen as an investment in the future.
<P>
The anticipated bottom line does not include any income from any of the new or expanded
programs and services being considered or from any change in advertising revenue, and projects
a possible first year loss of some members.  Once again, this is using a generous allowance for
expenses and very cautious projections for revenues.
<P>
-- Total revenues, status quo:                    $ 17,300,000<BR>
-- Total revenues, consolidated organization:       16,595,950<BR>
<BR>
-- Total expenses, status quo:                    $ 16,591,100<BR>
-- Total expenses, consolidated organization:       15,483,800<BR>
<BR>
-- Excess (loss), status quo:                   $      708,900<BR>
-- Excess (loss), consolidated organization:         1,112,150<BR>
<P>
The net revenues available for reinvestment into programs and services in the consolidated
organization are impressive.  This is even more impressive when the individual dollar
investments of industrial hygienists are factored in.  For people who are CIH and currently
members of both ACGIH and AIHA, the total dues per year are now $240.  In the consolidated
organization, the annual dues are projected at $110, plus an additional fee of $50 per year (down
from the current $70 per year) to maintain the CIH. For those who are only regular members of
ACGIH, dues will increase from $70 to $110.  For those who are only regular members of AIHA,
dues will increase from $100 to $110. 
<P>
The average operating margin (excess of revenue over expense divided by total revenue) of
existing organizations is 4.1 %.  The pro forma budget is based on an operating margin of 6.7%,
as suggested by Board members at the feedback meeting on March 17.  Should there be a
decision to return to a narrower operating margin, it would in turn reduce both the fund balance
and individual dues. 
<P>
The suggested dues level of $110 is calculated to produce this 6.7% operating margin, along with
other sources of income and reductions in expenditures.  For purposes of perspective and
comparability, if the existing organizations were now operating at a margin of 6.7%, the regular
dues for these organizations would now be: $106 for ACGIH; $129 for AIHA; and $79 for
ABIH/AIHA.
<P>
It is the fund balance (sometimes called reserves) which enables new projects, programs and
services. In order to assure adequate funds for ongoing and emerging programs and services, the
UTF developed a budget with a 6.7% operating margin.

<H2>Legal Considerations:</H2>

Although the responsibility for assuring legal compliance for everything from membership votes
on consolidation to determining the most advantageous tax status for the consolidated
organization and its subsidiaries will rest with legal counsel working with the Board of each
existing organization, the UTF pursued legal advice necessary to complete its charge.
<P>
During a December 22, 1995 conference call with Jerald Jacobs, Senior Partner with Jenner &
Block in Washington, DC and an expert in association law, five UTF members and the facilitator
asked if consolidation was possible, what form(s) it might take, and how the integrity and
independence of the TLVs, BEIs, lab accreditation program and professional certification could
be protected, while minimizing liability exposure. 
<P>
Mr. Jacobs advised that there were many ways to accomplish these objectives.  Most approaches
suggest the establishment of one or more subsidiary corporations. He urged the UTF to keep in
mind that the closer the relationship between the parent and the subsidiary, the greater the
liability exposure of the parent, with a direct link between the level of control and the level of
liability.
<P>
To protect the integrity of the TLV and BEI process in a subsidiary corporation, safeguards can
be built in which will assure who is eligible to draft guidelines or serve on a board. Similarly,
revenue streams can be protected by setting up irrevocable methods, e.g. through a royalty or
licensing arrangement, to assure an income stream to the parent organization. 
<P>
In answer to specific questions, Mr. Jacobs assured the UTF that the TLV and BEI programs
could be set up so that only government employees or academics could sit on the governing body
and as voting members of committees of the Exposure Guidelines subsidiary.  The question of
who owns the TLVs and BEIs could be addressed by allowing the subsidiary to own the
copyright for the guidelines, while providing that only the parent is licensed to sell them. None
of these subsidiaries would have members or charge dues.
<P>
It is also possible to build in protections which will make future separation untenable, by putting
in place penalties or an absolute prohibition.  These "fire walls" can protect the integrity of the
programs from unwarranted incursions by the parent organization yet keep these activities within
the consolidated organization, as subsidiary corporations, and provide as much liability
insulation as possible.
<P>
The opinion of Mr. Jacobs was later reinforced in an April 1, 1996 telephone call with Mr.
Steven Fellman, a partner in Galland Kharasch Morse & Garfinkle, a firm with a large and
respected association practice.  Mr. Fellman advised the UTF that a subsidiary could determine
its own need for dedicated staff, even if some services would be contracted from the parent
organization.  A subsidiary can be structured so that the Board can choose its own chief staff
officer, who will then report to that Board and also maintain a relationship with the Executive
Director of the parent organization. 
<P>
To further clarify the issues raised for the UTF, Richard Bar, also a partner with Galland
Kharasch Morse & Garfinkle, responded to two specific questions:
<P>
<EM>1)  Can the structure of the consolidated organization be such that a subsidiary may retain
absolute control over its bylaws and articles of incorporation and any amendments to them? </EM>
<P>
    Yes, the organization can be structured so that the subsidiary will retain absolute control
over its bylaws and articles of incorporation....The composition of the initial Board should be
specified in the articles of incorporation and the bylaws.  Thereafter, the bylaws should state that
each successive Board is to be elected by the current Board, and list the criteria that each Board
member must meet in order to qualify as a member of a particular Board, e.g. assuring that only
industrial hygienists from academe or government could be elected to the Board of the Exposure
Guideline subsidiary. 
<P>
<EM>2)  Can these corporate structures be set up so that a subsidiary will be prohibited from
becoming a membership organization?</EM>
<P>
    The subsidiary organizations can be structured so that they will not become membership
organizations. This could be clearly set forth in the organizational documents. 
<P>
Mr. Bar also reinforced the UTF decision that the subsidiary corporations and the parent Board
not have overlapping Boards.
<P>
Bylaws, and the right to amend them are therefore protected from incursion by the parent in all
matters except finances, licensing or other contractual arrangements. These issues can be
addressed through separate agreements between the parent and subsidiary corporations which
would clearly define where the revenue generated by each organization is to be deposited and
how allocated. Separate budgets and ledgers would be maintained for the parent and each
subsidiary. There is every reason to believe that fiscal agreements can be reached which will be
acceptable to all entities and assure sufficient funding for each.
<P>
Subsidiaries were created by the UTF to assure adequate protection of key processes and to
provide an adequate comfort level for all as well. Ultimately, the UTF was pleased to have
created a structure that provides a higher level of programmatic independence for each subsidiary
corporation than the degree of independence enjoyed today.  
<P>
At the time of this writing, it appears as if the most favorable tax exempt status (under the
Internal Revenue Code) for each corporation would be:
<P>
--      For the parent organization: 501 (c) (6)<BR>
--      For ABIH: 501 (c) (6), as it is currently<BR>
--      For the laboratory accreditation corporation: 501 (c) (6)<BR>
--      For the exposure guidelines corporation: 501 (c) (3)<BR>
--      For the Foundation: 501 (c) (3), as it is currently<BR>
<P>

On another matter, the UTF wanted to eliminate any misconceptions concerning the involvement
of military personnel in individual membership organizations.  The ruling provided for the
Department of Defense, Standards of Conduct Office (in Document Number 550.TR Section 3-301), clearly states that any individual may become a member and may participate in the
management of non-federal entities as individuals in a personal capacity, provided that he/she
acts exclusively outside the scope of his/her official position. Further examination of this issue
revealed that although government employees are prohibited from personally lobbying, an
individual may belong to an organization which engages in lobbying.
<P>
Most reassuring were the responses to all UTF concerns, expressed by three eminent attorneys,
each working extensively within the association community, that consolidation, with all the
protections requested by the UTF, is eminently doable.

<H2>Transition Issues:</H2>

Once the concept of consolidation is approved by each Board and the memberships endorse
forward movement, there are several critical transition issues and processes to address. In many
consolidations, a transition team oversees the process, often working with subcommittees on
special parts of the process. Areas that need attention during the period between endorsement of
the concept by the membership and final approval of the bylaws changes necessary to effect the
consolidation, include:

<H3>1)  Search Committee:</H3>

    The establishment of a search committee to work with whatever search consultant is
retained to help design the job description, role delineation, education and experience
requirements, salary and benefit range and profile for the first Executive Director of the
organization.
<P>
    The UTF recommends early attention to this critical task so that an Executive Director can
be hired with dispatch, to work with the transition teams and help put in place the staffing
required for a smooth transition. 

<H3>2)  Addressing Governance Issues:</H3>

    Careful preparation for new governance, including appointment of the first Nominating
Committee, the creation of guidelines  that require governance to be reflective of the diversity of
the membership, and the responsibility for holding open elections, is essential.  Because all
systems will be new, it is vital that the first effort work as smoothly and equitably as possible. 
Above all, this would be an early occasion to demonstrate the association's ability to meet the
promises made. 
<P>
    During this activity, the issues of leadership succession, i.e. dealing with placement of
those members now about to assume leadership in each of the participating organizations, must
be considered.

<H3>3)  Additional Legal Work:</H3>

    Ultimately, there will have to be a "due diligence" review of all legal issues, outstanding
contracts and commitments, reconciliation of pension plans and other documents, and a fiscal
audit, all intended to protect the boards and members of each organization. A summary of the due
diligence findings should be included when the plan is finally presented to the members of each
organization for ratification and approval of the bylaws changes required. 
<P>
    The state where each participating organization is now incorporated will dictate the
requirements for member votes on the consolidation. In Pennsylvania (site of incorporation of the
ABIH) and in Ohio (site of incorporation for ACGIH) a majority vote of the membership is
required.  In Illinois (site of the incorporation of AIHA), a 2/3 membership vote is required.
<P>
    Since it is possible to consolidate two or more organizations by dissolving all participating
organizations and creating a new one, and also possible to consolidate organizations by retaining
one as the corporate shell, there are major decisions to be made in this area, decisions which
should be made with outside counsel.  The decision as to which path to take is usually    dictated by which is the more expedient method, i.e. which is easier, cheaper and safer, and
which is acceptable to existing organizations.
<P>
    Finally, bylaws will need to be drafted for the consolidated organization.

<H3>4)  Headquarters:
</H3>
    Since the consolidation plan calls for a single headquarters with separate "wings" for each
subsidiary organization (and the pro forma budget anticipates this), it will be necessary to
consider all headquarters-related issues during the transition.  
    This will include selecting a site, phasing out existing space contracts, sensitivity to staff
disruptions and concerns, etc.

<H3>5)  Publications:</H3>

    Consolidation of the AIHA and ACGIH Journals and other appropriate publications, e.g.
newsletters and membership directories.

<H3>6)  Guidelines:</H3>

    Guidelines for establishing public policy and utilizing member input, as well as for
determining which initiatives to pursue, must be crafted. 

<H3>7)  Master Calendar:</H3>

    Development of a master calendar, to assure that support of scheduled programs, services,
conferences, etc. is maintained.

<H3>8)  Fiscal Issues:</H3>

    These fall into two categories.  The first deals with funding the transition. 
<P>
    The second deals with completing an actual budget for the first full year of operations of the consolidated organization, for presentation and approval by the first Board when it is duly elected and seated.

<H3>9)  Name and Logo:</H3>

    The UTF made an early decision to leave these issues to the transition teams.  
<P>
<STRONG>It is anticipated that all transition activities can be completed, including the final membership
votes on bylaws, in time to launch the consolidated organization at the May, 1997, AIHCE
Conference. </STRONG>
      
<H2>Conclusion:</H2>

All the members of the UTF expressed appreciation for having been selected to work on this
important and ambitious project, and expressed thanks to their respective organizations for the
privilege of serving.  They completed their work with increased respect and admiration for each
other and for the work of each participating organization.
<P>
John Adams wrote of the First Continental Congress, "Every man was an orator, a critic and a
statesman, and therefore every man upon every question must show his oratory, his criticism and
his political abilities."  With questions of such lasting importance before that Congress, all of us
remain grateful that  "Every question was discussed with a moderation, acuteness and minuteness
equal to that of Queen Elizabeth's Privy Council!".  
<P>
During all UTF meetings, every person certainly demonstrated his / her critical, statesman, and
political skills as well. And every item was reviewed in as much detail and with as much care as
was possible.  John Adams and Queen Elizabeth I would have been proud! Inestimable hours at
formal meetings and at work on interim assignments were generously offered, and always
without complaint.
<P>
While the First Continental Congress anticipated a negative reception to its work in London, and
therefore voted to meet again after their formal tenure was over, the UTF believes it has fully
executed its charge and fully completed its business.  It does not expect to meet again.
<P>
The UTF anticipates that this report will receive a careful review by Boards and members, in an
environment which looks at what might be, rather than at what is.  If this report receives less than
that, it will end up a "filing cabinet" report. 
<P>
These recommendations are offered as the UTF's best efforts to position the profession for the
future. AAIH, ABIH, ACGIH and AIHA may accept or reject some or all of these
recommendations, but those decisions should be made as objectively as possible, attentive to the
best interests of industrial hygienists and those they serve. 
<P>

<BODY>
<H1><CENTER>RESOLUTION</H1></CENTER>
<HR>
The industrial hygiene organizations (ACGIH, AIHA, ABIH/AAIH) agree to appoint
two Board members each to an integrating team, by November 1, 1996, to address the
following issues, as they relate to consolidation:
<P>
1.  Protection of TLVs; and,
2.  Representation of minority members (e.g., governmental) in public policy statements and
positions; and,
3.  Adequate representation of professional groups (e.g., governmental ) on elected Boards.
<P>
The integrating team will be supported financially and administratively by each organization
equally (ABIH/AAIH will be treated as one organization).  If the three issues previously
identified can be resolved, the integrating team will provide a revised consolidated model for
Board vote within an <I>estimated</I> time period of 90-270 days.  In any case, the
organizations and/or their successors agree to work toward increasing cooperation for the benefit
of the profession.
<P>
If the Boards agree to the revised model, each will submit this by common ballot to their
memberships for a vote.

<P>
<H3>Select Presentation Style</H3>
Choose platform or poster presentation and indicate your choice in the space provided on the

<DT>5. Abstracts should be written without touching or going beyond the lines on either side.
Only one-page abstracts, submitted on the original abstract form, will be considered.<BR>
<DT>6. Use standard abbreviations and symbols (refer to <I>American Industrial Hygiene
Association Journal,</I> published by AIHA, or <I>Applied Occupational and Environmental
Hygiene,</I> published by ACGIH). Keep abbreviations to a minimum, and define each one
when used for the first time.<BR></DL>

</DL>
THE QUALITY OF THE ABSTRACT IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IN
THE PROGRAM COMMITTEE'S DECISION TO ACCEPT OR REJECT THE  ABSTRACT.

<H3>Example of a High-Quality Abstract</H3>
A high quality abstract, in addition to the requirements specified in this brochure, also
incorporates the following:<BR>
1. Acceptable font and type size.<BR>
2. Copy within the lined area.<BR>
3. Clean copy, no typographical errors.<BR>
4. Application to the practice of industrial hygiene.<BR>

<H3>Changes, Cancellations, Withdrawals</H3>
<UL><LI>Under no circumstances can an abstract that has been submitted for presentation be
changed. A submitted abstract is regarded by the Program Committee as a commitment to
present.
<LI>Cancellations, particularly after the abstract has been accepted, are viewed by the Program
Committee as highly unprofessional. 
<LI>If extenuating circumstances prevent the presenting author from making the presentation, it
is that author's obligation to find an alternate presenter. 
<LI>Withdrawals must be in writing to the AIHCE office as soon as possible.</UL>

<H3>Publication Policy</H3>
The <I>American Industrial Hygiene Association Journal,</I> published by AIHA, and
<I>Applied Occupational and Environmental Hygiene, </I>published by ACGIH, have first
publication rights to all papers presented at the AIHCE. If an author plans to publish the paper, it
must be submitted after presentation at the AIHCE.

<H3>Checklist</H3>
Before submitting your abstract to the American Industrial Hygiene Conference & Exposition,
please check the following list. Omission of any of the following items will result in the rejection
of your abstract.
<UL><LI>Is the abstract written in compliance with the "Requirements of Abstract Content?"
<LI>Have you indicated three subject areas to which the paper is best suited?
<LI>Have you carefully followed all the specifications outlined in the section "Preparing Your
Abstract?"
<LI>Have you used an original abstract form? (Do not fold if mailing.)
<LI>Have you filled out and enclosed the acknowledgment card for mailed submissions?
<LI>Have you mailed, faxed, or e-mailed your abstract in sufficient time to reach the AIHCE
office on or before October 17, 1996?</UL>

<H3>Speaker Registration</H3>
All technical session speakers must register for the conference. Speakers attending ONLY the
technical session where they must make a presentation may contact the conference programs
coordinator about obtaining a speaker's pass valid for the two- to four-hour session only.
Members of AIHA and ACGIH are not eligible to use this pass. In all other cases, full conference
registration or one-day registration fees apply.

<H3>Certification Maintenance Points</H3>
The American Board of Industrial Hygiene (ABIH) will award 0.5 CM point per presentation for
ABIH certified industrial hygienists (CIHs) who give a poster presentation at AIHCE. During a
Diplomate's six-year CM cycle, 20-minute platform presentations may be accumulated to equal
one hour which is awarded 0.5 CM point.
<P>
ABSTRACTS MUST BE RECEIVED AT THE AIHCE OFFICE BY OCTOBER 17, 1996.
ABSTRACTS RECEIVED AFTER THE DEADLINE WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED FOR

Thorton briefly reviewed the minutes of the December 20, 1995 and asked for corrections
and/or revisions.  Hearing none, the following motion was presented:
<b>MOTION:</b>   Approve the minutes of the December 20, 1995 meeting as presented.
Passed.
<b>MOTION:</b>   Adopt and ratify the results of mail ballots and votes by telephone occurring
since last Board meeting. Passed
Thornton asked that board members update Action Item list and submit them to him.

<h3>3.  Treasurer's Report - Anderson</h3>
Anderson commended the Board and staff for their 1995 performance as the association
ended the year with a $600,000+ surplus over budget.  The annual audit looks very good with no
changes anticipated for year-end 1995.  Only minor management changes are expected in the
auditor's letter.  The sale of the Akron, Ohio building is not finalized.  A counter offer has been
made on the current contract, but it is not expected to be accepted.  An offer is expected next
week from a physician.  

<h3>4.  Conflict of Interest and Antitrust Policies - McCluskey</h3>
Discussion on the aspect of more members becoming consultants and the anticipated need
to have a way to deal with conflict of interest and antitrust issues.  It was a sense of the board to
get additional information from Attorney Herold and revisit the issue on the May agenda. 
Motion was withdrawn until the May meeting.

<h3>5. Policy Manual - Burton</h3>
Discussion of the Task Force's objectives.  Burton and Morrison met and reviewed the
ASAE's Board Policy Manual.  The project is to start with simply collecting and reviewing
existing policies and reviewing the Motion Log for other policies that should be part of the
manual.  This project has a 1997 due date.

<h3>6. Update OHSMS - Lee/McCluskey</h3>
There will be an ANSI meeting on May 7 and 8.  The Task Force would like a final
format to present at that meeting.  Draft 5 will be complete and sent out for mail ballot prior to
that time.  This is a should/shall document.  The shall is effective once a company accepts the
document for implementation.  Editorial changes are due by Friday, March 22 to Dave Dyjak.

<h3>7. Emerging Issues Committee Update - Burton</h3>
The second draft of emerging issues is complete; the third draft will be ready in May. 
Discussion centered on the fact that the Committee needs fewer listed items.  The Board feels the
Committee should present ideas with the effects of AIHA members in a complete report rather
than a string of listed topics.  Rose and Mansdorf will work with the Committee to get them
integrated into the Strategic Plan and request the Committee Chair participate in the Friday
Board meeting during the 2-hour Strategic Plan discussion so that they provide input for the
August Strategic Planning meeting in Boston. 

<h3>8.  Travel Expense Guidelines - Anderson</h3>
During the last budget development process for Committees, the Finance Committee
requested that a document outlining the Travel Expense Reimbursement Guidelines for
Committees be developed.  After much discussion, the Board has recommended that the
Guideline that was presented in the Board packet be broadened for Task Forces, Board members,
etc.  With that assignment, Anderson and Morrison will rework the document.  It will then be
sent out for mail ballot approval.  The Motion presented was withdrawn pending the document
revision.

<h3>9. Establishment of a Joint Ethics Education Committee - Nichting</h3>
After discussion of how to proceed, it was determined that we should move forward with
a Joint Ethics Education program.  It was decided that appointment of the four AIHA
representatives to the Joint Ethics Education Committee would also be the same individuals
appointed to the AIHA Ethics Committee.<BR>
<b>MOTION:</b>   Approve the creation of a Standing Joint Ethics Education Committee.
Passed.

<h3>10.  Changes to Investment Policy - McCluskey</h3>
A mail ballot was approved in May 1994 giving responsibility for the Investment Policy
to the Finance Committee.  The Board now wishes to rescind that decision and revise the
Investment Policy.<BR>
<b>MOTION:</b>   Move that the Investment Policy (dated 11/21/95) be revised as
follows:<br>
<i>Procedure 1B</i> - "Recommendations for any revisions or modifications will be made by
the
Treasurer, Executive Director and Comptroller to the Finance Committee and approved by the
Board of Directors."<BR>
<i>Procedure 4B</i> - "The Executive Director and Comptroller will review the candidate(s)
and make
a recommendation to the Board of Directors for approval."
Passed.

<h3>11.  Consultants' Task Force Survey - Burton</h3>
The Task Force feels that the long term future will require a Special Interest Group for
Consultants within the association.  They would like to see this pursued.  Mansdorf also reported
that there will be a Consultants' Symposium in November in Las Vegas.

<h3>12.  Supporting Research and Technical Development at AIHF - Burton</h3>
Burton stated that after discussing this idea with several persons involved with the
Foundation fundraising campaign this issue would be better discussed at a later date.  Burton
rescinded his Motion and will submit after the fundraising campaign is complete.

<h3>13.  Use of Titles in Database and Directory - Banks</h3>
Discussion of various options of choosing 1, 2, 3 or no designations.  It was finally
determined that AIHA will list any and all designations submitted by the member for inclusion in
the database and Directory.  However a disclaimer will be listed indicating that no verification or
checking as to the validity of designations has been done.

<h3>14.  Update Priority Issues - Burton</h3>
<UL><LI>OSHA Reform - The House is delaying action until next year.  OSHA may receive a
10% budget cut.
<LI>NIOSH still does not have an approved budget for this year.
<LI>Indiana has passed a Title Protection Bill.
<LI>Six states have passed Title Protection.
<LI>Multiple Chemical Sensitivities - Reid - Draft document is almost ready and will be
issued soon.
<LI>Reproduction Hazards - Reid - Many problems with the Task Force.</UL></LI>

<h3>15.  11 Board Issues - Rose</h3>
<UL><LI>The National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) meeting will be April 29, 1996
in D.C. to celebrate NIOSH's 25th anniversary.
<LI>Rose, Mansdorf, Burton and Trippler met with Joe Dear on March 13, 1996.
<LI>Community Service - R. Sheriff sent memos to the Board on outreach opportunities
through the Local Sections.
<LI>Officer/Director Time - This is obviously still a concern evidenced by the difficulty we
had in obtaining candidates for the 1996 Board election.</UL></LI>

<h3>16.  Standards of Good Practice Update - Burton</h3>
This Task Force surveyed the technical committees.  IAQ and Ergonomics want to write
Standards of Good Practice for their specific areas of expertise.  The Task Force will present
recommendations in May.  AIHA needs to develop a number of levels of standards, guidelines,
etc.  Board is to submit responses, ideas, etc. to the Task Force.  

<h3>17.  Status Report on NIOSH Book - Rose/DiNardi</h3>
DiNardi gave a status-to-date review of the book.  The final publication will have 52
chapters.  He has enlisted 50 authors.  Drafts for the chapters are due either May 1 or June 1;
each being approximately 30 chapter pages.  Final drafts are due November 1.

<h3>18.  Technical Committees - Burton</h3>
The Interim Draft Report was presented.  The Board is to provide written feedback to the
Task Force on this draft report within two weeks.

<h3>19.  Leadership Workshop/Local Sections - Mansdorf</h3>
91 attendees are expected at the Leadership Workshop.  Having the Board Coordinators
call their individual committees and local sections really seemed to boost the interest and
attendance.  
<P>
Joint expectations is the issue with Local Sections.  The Board approved Local Section
partnership from December was sent to the Local Sections last week.  Results are due back in
mid-April.  The needs assessment is still in the working stage.  
<P>
The Student Local Section Award was received as a good idea by the Board.  The sense
of the Board was that AIHA would fund the award.  The specific information will be in the May
Board packet for action at that time.

<h3>20.  Strategic Plan Update - Mansdorf</h3>
The Past President will have the responsibility of the strategic planning meeting.  There
will be a 2-hour strategic plan discussion at the Friday AIHCE Board meeting.  The August
Strategic Planning meeting will be in Boston.  Schedule for action this year; May - cover essence
of the major issues of the Plan; August - heavy discussion and "almost" finalization; mail ballot
to finalize; September is the due date for departmental business plans and preliminary budget
preparation; November - Finance Committee budget presentation.
<P>
Each Board member is to identify two trends and the corresponding outcomes from the
Strategic Plan that need to be redone/revised due to these trends.  Submit to A. Dees.   Rose,
Mansdorf and Burton will compile them.

<h3>21. - 26.   Information Only Reports</h3>

<h3>27.  Old Business - All</h3>
<UL><LI>Wroblewski announced that if the Board, as a group was interested, perhaps a private
tour of the White House or Capital could be arranged during AIHCE.
<LI>Lynch to pursue AIHA participation as a reviewer in Framework for Harmonization in
the area of risk assessment.
<LI>1:30 p.m. - 5:30 p.m. will be the Joint Boards' UTF meeting on Saturday, May 18 at
AIHCE.
<LI>The possibility of an Open Forum of the Joint Boards' to discuss UTF with the

<HR>
<p>
<h3>1.Call to Order/Quorum Verification - Mansdorf/Thornton</h3>
President Mansdorf called the meeting to order at 8:30 a.m.  Secretary Thornton confirmed
quorum present.

<h3>2. Secretary's Report - Thornton</h3>
The minutes of the May 19, 1996 meeting have not been prepared.  They will be presented at the
August 1996 Board meeting along with the minutes of May 24, 1996.  Record of Actions will be
prepared and submitted with the August meeting material.  Thornton gave a verbal report of the
June 21, 1996 Joint AIHA/ACGIH Executive Committee meeting.

<h3>3. Treasurer's Report - Dyson</h3>
No financial reports were presented.  Dyson indicated 3 situations that may affect the AIHA
finances:
<dl><dd>a) ACGIH/AIHA contract on the AIHCE</DD>
<dd>b) Unification</dd>
<dd>c) Proposal for ABIH cutting Certification Maintenance points for AIHCE</dd></dl>
President appointed Dyson and L. Anderson as a task force regarding AIHCE certification points
issued by ABIH.

<h3>4. Update of Activities with Technical Committees - Rock</h3>

Rock reported that committee productivity has improved as a result of the AIHA Strategic Plan. 
Committees are being advised of the request for Journal articles from committees.

<h3>5. Report of Government Affairs Activity - T. Cator</h3>
Cator reported that AIHA has been effective in some areas such as being asked to provide
testimony on OSHA.  R. Reich speaking at the AIHCE shows the impact AIHA has had.  AIHA
must continue to build trust relationships with Congress, through staff and members who will
come and talk face-to-face to Congress and staffers.

<h3>8. Conflict of Interest - A. Herold</h3>
Attorney Herold reported that the sample Conflict of Interest policy he submitted was in response
to Executive Director Banks.  Interpretation of the issue of Competing Organizations (#6) means
that information learned in one's capacity as a Board member.  It should remain within AIHA.  It
does not prohibit membership, etc. with competing organizations.  As to Board members
teaching courses; the association cannot request Board members refrain from earning a living by
teaching these courses, but a potential conflict of interest could be present.  Conflict of Interest
policy can apply as far down the organization as the Board wishes, but usually applies only to
officers and directors.
<p>
A question was raised regarding antitrust areas on pricing discussion.  Herold advised that any
discussion of price fixing or even the implication of such may be viewed as antitrust.
<p>
<b>MOTION:</b> Adopt a Conflict of Interest policy for AIHA.Withdrawn
<p>
Wright and Lee will work on a draft Conflict of Interest policy tailored to the AIHA Board.<br>
Herold gave an update on ethics case stating that 4 depositions are to be taken later this
summer.
<p>
Herold advised that as AIHA bylaws do not state how disposal of net worth would happen
should consolidation occur, the Illinois not-for-profit law would apply.  That law reads that all
debts must be paid and then the remaining assets may go to a for-profit or not-for-profit
organization.

<BODY>
<H1><CENTER>Addendum A: UTF Process</CENTER></H1>
<HR>
<H2>THE UNIFICATION TASK FORCE PROCESS </H2>
                                
<H3>1. Unification Task Force</H3>

     The Unification Task Force (UTF) shall consist of three representatives from each
organization, for a total of 12.  The chief staff officer of each organization shall be expected to
attend each meeting, unless officially excused by that organization. The chief staff officer attends
as an ex officio representative with voice but not vote.

<H3>2. There will be no preconditions established. </H3>
Everything is negotiable.

<H3>3. No premature promises will be made for anything that will occur after conclusion of the talks. </H3>
Each organization will continue to handle its internal personnel issues and commitments until
then.

<H3>4. The Unification Task Force (UTF) members will remain in place until  the UTF completes its
business.</H3>

<H3>5. Full and Complete Negotiations</H3>

The parties shall negotiate fully and completely on every issue raised.

<H3>6. Timetable</H3>

The parties agree to establish agreed-upon goals as to what will be accomplished, including a
time table for accomplishing each of the major steps needed to reach those goals.  Timetables
may be subject to change in order to finish a goal properly and completely.

<H3>7. Timing of Meetings</H3>

The parties will set the full schedule of meetings for the remainder of 1995 and for the first
quarter of 1996.

<H3>8. Quorum</H3>

A meeting will be considered an official meeting if at least two voting representatives from each
organization are present.  While nomeeting will be canceled if only one voting representative
from any one organization can attend, any matter that requires a consensus decision will be
deferred until the next meeting when two voting representatives from each organization are in
attendance.

<H3>9. Agenda</H3>

Each IH organization agrees to adhere to the written agenda which will be distributed prior to
each meeting, unless there is agreement to waive this requirement for a specific meeting. 

<H3>10. Executive Summaries</H3>
The facilitator shall prepare and distribute an executive summary of each meeting.  Each
summary will be reviewed and approved at the following meeting.  The approved summaries will
be marked "Confidential/Not for Distribution."  The facilitator will also prepare an internal news
release after each meeting that can be shared through each organization's newsletter/publication.

<H3>11. Caucus</H3>

The parties accept the concept of caucus whereby any party may ask for time to discuss pending
issues privately, or with the facilitator. The facilitator may also call a caucus.

<H3>12. Executive Session</H3>

Should any organization wish to call an executive session for voting members only, that can be
done with the agreement of at least three of the organizations.  The facilitator will attend these
sessions, unless the subject is the facilitator.

<H3>13. Media and Member Communications</H3>

The parties agree that all communications to the media and to the memberships regarding any
aspect of negotiations shall be by joint release or understanding.  Each organization shall appoint
a person to serve as media contact.  No individual interview or opinion will be shared outside the
UTF.  The facilitator will not speak to the media unless authorized by the UTF.  A news release
of the meeting will be prepared by the facilitator for use by each organization in their
newsletters/publications.  All UTF members will have an opportunity to review this release and
will be requested to immediately forward comments to their staff officer.

<H3>14. Special Assignments</H3>

Special task forces or task teams may be appointed as needed, from inside and beyond the UTF
roster.  These task forces may be assigned staff support and/or the services of the facilitator,
whichever is deemed      more appropriate.

<H3>15. Organization Executive Committees and Boards</H3>

The work and recommendations of the UTF should be reviewed on a regular basis.  The final
approved Executive Summary of each meeting will be provided to each organization's board of
directors by the Chief Staff Officer.
<P>
The UTF may call a joint meeting of the Executive Committees or  Boards, with the unanimous
consent of all parties.

<H3>16. Lines of Communication</H3>

    <STRONG> a.</STRONG> All correspondence, invoices, agendas and executive summaries shall be submitted by
the facilitator to each organization.<BR>

     <STRONG>b.</STRONG> Any member of the UTF may contact the facilitator at any time. <BR>

     <STRONG>c.</STRONG> The facilitator may contact any member of the UTF, if and as necessary.<BR>

     <STRONG>d.</STRONG> Individual expenses for each UTF participant  will be handled within each respective
organization.  Breakfast, lunch and related meeting expenses will be rotated among organizations
and all expenses will be reconciled among the organizations at the end of the UTF process.  


<H3>17. Projected Meetings</H3>

The order in which large issue areas will be addressed follows, subject to amendment and
revision, by the UTF and/or the facilitator, as required:
<P>
     <STRONG>a.</STRONG> Agreement as to UTF process.<BR>
     <STRONG>b.</STRONG> Finalize plan of work and time frame.<BR>
     <STRONG>c.</STRONG> Develop a compelling vision of the future for industrial hygiene.<BR>
     <STRONG>d.</STRONG> Determine criteria against which decisions will be evaluated.<BR>
     <STRONG>e.</STRONG> Programs and services issues<BR>
     <STRONG>f.</STRONG> Role in public policy<BR>
     <STRONG>g.</STRONG> Image and identity, for the profession and the unified entity<BR>
     <STRONG>h.</STRONG> Membership criteria and categories; local groups/sections     <BR>
     <STRONG>i.</STRONG> Structure needed to accommodate all of the above.<BR>
     <STRONG>j.</STRONG> Governance desired and required<BR>
     <STRONG>k.</STRONG> Financing the operation: Drafting the first pro forma budget<BR>
     <STRONG>l.</STRONG> Headquarters and staffing issues<BR>

          
<H3>18. Unification Task Force Charge</H3>
                                
The Unification Task Force (UTF) is charged by the  Boards of Directors of the AAIH, ABIH,
ACGIH, and AIHA "with researching and analyzing all available background information and
data in order to make recommendations to the four governing bodies regarding the efficacy of
uniting the four organizations for the benefit of the profession and the respective members of the
four organizations.
<P>
These recommendations may take the form of one or more proposals ranging from maintaining
the status quo to any of a number of kinds of unification. The UTF will prioritize its
recommendations/proposals and provide appropriate rationale and explanation for each of them.
<P>
The primary thrust of the UTF will be to determine what forms, if any, of unification are
advisable and to describe them in sufficient detail to permit the respective organizations to fully
evaluate the options and make appropriate decisions on each."

<H3>19. Last Steps</H3>
      
If the UTF determines that formal unification is not in the best interest of members, then a full
report of the rationale for that decision shall be developed and presented to each respective
board.  If the UTF determines that formal unification is in the best interest of the organizations,
the UTF will provide for the preparation of a transition plan.
<P>
This process has been agreed to by members of the UTF.

* Members: It is estimated that about 14,400 individuals are now paying full dues to one or more
of the associations.  This is based on estimates that about 90% of AAIH members are members
paying full dues in either the AIHA or the ACGIH, and that about 48% of ACGIH members are
also full dues-paying members of AIHA. Current member categories in ACGIH and AIHA are:

Following is a comparison of dues in a consolidated organization operating at
an assumed margin of 6.7% with dues as they are today and as they would be
today if the existing organizations were also operating at a margin of 6.7%.

<H3>STATUS QUO, COOPERATIVE, FEDERATED & CONSOLIDATED MODELS DUES COMPARISON</H3>

Following is a comparison of dues rates in the various models considered by
the UTF.  Note that in the Status Quo, the four organizations taken together
operate at a margin of 4.1%.  In the Cooperative, Federated, and Consolidated
models, a margin of 6.7% is assumed since this was the "ideal" margin
indicated by members of the four Boards at the March 17, 1996 meeting. 
Therefore, in addition to the actual Status Quo at 4.1%, the Status Quo is
also shown at a margin of 6.7% for purposes of comparability.

Overall, a conservative perspective was taken on revenues and a more liberal perspective on expenses.  As a result, the pro forma excess of revenue over expense may be regarded as a minimum.

                                
<H3>NOTES</H3>

A.    Dues were calculated only after all other revenue and expense had been determined and are based on a 6.7% margin
(excess of revenue over expense as a percentage of total revenue.)  The resulting dues is $110.  No dues are allocated to program areas. The certification maintenance fee is reduced to $50.

I.    Because ACGIH now reimburses travel expense of volunteers more typically than does AIHA, a contingency of $300,000
is included in case those typically not reimbursed by AIHA currently begin to request reimbursement from the new
organization.  AIHA currently reimburses approximately $200,000 per year.  This contingency therefore provides an
additional $300,000.
<P>
J.    Adj./Savings of $1,107,300 breakdown:

<PRE>
              Staff                   $973,000
              Rent                     138,000
              Other                    296,000
              Contingency             (300,000)
                                     $1,107,300
</PRE>
<P>
K.   The $184,000 "Savings" is the amount of AIHCE income paid to ACGIH which amount would now remain with the
consolidated organization.
<P>
L.   Staffing is reduced by 16.9 FTEs resulting in a decrease in expense for salaries, taxes and benefits of $973,000.  


<H3>ASSUMPTIONS</H3>

1.  The starting point is the total of the 5 organizations' 1996 budgets plus 5% (AAIH, ABIH, ACGIH, AIHA, AIHAF).
<P>
2.  The assumed first year of operations is 1997.
<P>
3.  The one-time costs of consolidation are separately detailed on Page 5.
<P>
4.  Revenues and expenses are reduced by intercompany payments (e.g. AIHCE, AIHAF, AAIH, etc.).
<P>
5.  Technical publication sales remain unchanged.
<P>
6.  Funds available for investment are temporarily reduced by the one-time costs of consolidation, thus temporarily
reducing interest income in the first year of operations.
<P>
7.    Rent is assumed to be in a high cost city like Washington, D.C.  The amount of office space is reduced due to
decreased staffing.  The average annual cost per FTE of salaries, taxes, and fringe is $55,000 (1997), based on current
existing costs of the four IH organizations.
<P>
8.   No new programs and services are assumed in this pro forma budget.

<TITLE> AIHA Professional Liability Program</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1> AIHA Professional Liability Program</H1>
<HR>
<H2>A Program to Protect You While You're Creating A Safe And Healthy Work Environment
</H2>
<UL><LI>Professional Liability With Pollution Coverage.
<LI>Limits Starting at $500,000.
<LI>Minimum Premiums From $1,750.</UL></LI>
<P>
<H2>AIHA and Sedgwick</H2>
Taking the lead to provide members with the Comprehensive Professional Liability protection
they need as IHs, and the service they deserve as members of AIHA.
<P>
<H2>As an Industrial Hygienist, Are You Protected?</H2>
Industrial Hygienists can and have been sued.  The effects of a successful suit could be
catastrophic to a private practice. Even if the suit is unsuccessful, the legal costs can be sizable.
<P>
The litigious nature of society invites suit to even the most cautious scientist.  The unfortunate
reality is that third party allegations of negligence and breach of contract create liability
potential, regardless of fault.  The ultimate claim cost extends far beyond financial terms,
impacting professional reputation and disrupting work.
<P>
<H2>AIHA Professional Liability Program</H2>
Sedgwick and AIHA are pleased to offer the AIHA Professional Liability Program.  This
important member services program is the culmination of 23 months of intensive investigation,
research, and negotiation with numerous insurance companies on behalf of the AIHA
membership.  
<P>
The result is the AIHA Professional Liability Program where members benefit from specific
contract enhancements not normally available in the standard marketplace.  The program is
underwritten by an A rated carrier, exclusively offered through Sedgwick of  Virginia, and
available only to members of AIHA.
<P>
<H2>Who is Sedgwick?</H2>
Sedgwick is a leading provider of insurance broking, and risk management services.  However,
Sedgwick does a great deal more than package insurance programs.  We research new, emerging
areas of liability, and develop targeted, cost-effective insurance programs to meet the challenging
needs of the industry.
<P>
Sedgwick's underwriting and loss control expertise (including many in-house CIHs) enables us
to evaluate the technical needs of the IH profession.  Additionally, our dedication to
administrative procedures provides our clients with the assurance that even the smallest details
are being properly handled.
<P>
<H2>AIHA's Professional Liability Program</H2>
Why do I need professional liability coverage? Practically any organization or individual who
improperly performs services can cause a client to suffer economic loss.  As an IH, you can be
held legally responsible for damages suffered by your client, as a result of your, or your
employees', failure to meet the level of performance, quality, fitness or durability warranted or
represented by you.<BR>
As an IH, why do I need pollution/asbestos coverage?  While you may not be involved in the
actual remediation of pollutants such as asbestos, your exposure to liability for these losses is
inherent.  
<P>
For example:<BR>
During  your services as an IH you failed to identify the existence of asbestos-containing
materials. You would need pollution coverage in order for the policy to respond.  Suppose in
your inspections for other potential pollutants you caused a release, exposing employees?  Again,
pollution coverage would be required.  Many IHs include in their services oversight of
reme-diation projects.  You could be held as a potentially responsible party, again requiring
pollution
coverage.
<P>
Who is insured by this program?  The AIHA Professional Liability Program Policy will cover the
named insured and any past or present employee, director, partner or executive officer while
acting within the scope of their duties on behalf of the named insured, or any person for whose
Wrongful Act the insured is legally responsible for.
<P>
<H2>What are the program features?</H2>

<H1>The Industrial Hygiene Laboratory Accreditation Program
(IHLAP)</H1>
The Industrial Hygiene Laboratory Accreditation Program is
designed specifically for
laboratories involved in analyzing samples to evaluate workplace
exposure.  Participation assists
the laboratory in maintaining high quality standards.<BR>

<H2><A NAME="IH2"> Why participate in the Industrial Hygiene
Laboratory
Accreditation Program?</A></H2>
<P> When a laboratory is accredited by AIHA, the laboratory and
its clients have the assurance
that the laboratory has met defined standards for performance
based on examination of a variety
of criteria.  The AIHA IHLAP is the largest program of its kind
in the world and has been in
operation since 1974.  When an IH laboratory is accredited by
AIHA, it becomes part of an elite
group of laboratories achieving and maintaining a high level of
professional performance.</P>
<BR>
<H2><A NAME="IH3">Who should participate in the program?</A></H2>
<P>An industrial hygiene laboratory is a laboratory that analyzes
samples taken in the workplace
environment.  Since results of these analyses are used to
determine the magnitude or presence of
a problem in the workplace environment, it is vital that the
laboratory analyzing the samples be
proficient in producing high quality data on which important
health decisions will be based. 
Accreditation from AIHA is a mark of that capability.</P>
<H2><A NAME="IH4">What if an organization has multiple industrial
hygiene
laboratories?</A></H2>
<P>If an organization has a number of in-house industrial hygiene
laboratories based in different
locations, each location will be identified as a separate entity,
and each must individually comply
with all accreditation requirements.</P>
<H2><A NAME="IH5">What are the criteria for
accreditation?</A></H2>
The main program requirement areas are:<BR>
<BR>
<H3>1) Personnel Qualifications</H3>
<P>The laboratory director is the person responsible for the
overall direction of the laboratory.
 This individual must meet specified standards and be located on
site.  The director's primary
responsibiltiy is the operation and administration of the
laboratory.  To be considered qualified,
a director either must have a degree in a basic science and a
minimum of five years industrial
hygiene experience beyond the bachelor's level or must be
certified by the American Board of
Industrial Hygiene.  Experience beyond the bachelor's level may
be a combination of academic
and work experience.</P>
<P>The laboratory supervisor is the person supervising the
day-to-day operations of the
laboratory.  To be qualified, a supervisor either must have a
degree in a basic science and a
minimum of five years experience in industrial hygiene chemistry,
or related procedures, or must
be certified in the chemical practices of industrial hygiene by
the Amercian Board of Industrial
Hygiene.  A minimum of two and one-half years of the experience
must be in industrial hygiene
chemistry, with the remaining years of experience in other
chemical analytical procedures.</P>
<P> It is possible for a single person to serve as both
laboratory director and supervisor
providing
the qualifications and responsibilities of both roles are
satisfied.</P>
<P>The laboratory must have a quality control coordinator who has
a minimum of a bachelor's
degree in the basic sciences and have documented education in
statistics and quality control
procedures.  The quality control coordinator should be
independent of the analysts and be
capable
of effectively administering a quality control program.</P>
<P>All laboratory analysts must be qualified by education and/or
experience to produce reliable
analytical results.</P>
<H3>2) Participation in PAT Program</H3>
<P>When a laboratory enters the AIHA IH Laboratory Accreditation
Program, it is required to
participate in the AIHA Proficiency Analytical Testing (PAT)
program for all categories of
analytes that are part of the services provided by the
laboratory</P>
<P> Data obtained from participation in the PAT program is
available to the IH Laboratory
Accreditation Committee, and the evaluation of results, insofar
as it affects the accreditation of a
laboratory, will be the responsibility of that committee.</P>
<H3>3) Facilities</H3>
<P>A laboratory must have adequate space, facilities, and
equipment for the services
provided.</P>
<H3>4)Quality Control & Equipment</H3>
<P>Routine quality control procedures must be an integral part of
a laboratory's procedures and
functions.  A quality assurance plan (a working document
itemizing the day to day
implementation
of the laboratory's quality assurance and quality control
procedures) will be evaluated.</P>
<P>Quality control for laboratories performing airborne asbestos
analyses must comply with the
quality assurance requirements of the Asbestos Standard CFR
1910.1001, Appendix A, and
NIOSH 7400 Method, current revision.</P>
<H3>5) Laboratory Records</H3>
<P>The laboratory must maintain proper and adequate records and
files.  A sample numbering
and tracking system, analytical data, analytical results, report
format, records of analytical data,
and reporting of the quality control data will be evaluated.</P>
<H3>6) Methods of Analysis</H3>
<P>The methods (not procedures) used by the laboratory, including
a method review program,
will be evaluated to determine that accepted and documented
industrial hygiene laboratory
methods are used, approved by the laboratory director, made
available to industrial hygiene
analysts, and modified with the approval of the laboratory
director.</P>
<H3>7) Site Visits</H3>
<P>Site visits of laboratories are conducted by trained,
experienced assesors acting on behalf
of AIHA.  These visits will generally take place once every three
years, unless additional site
visits are deemed necessary by the IH Laboratory Accreditation
Committee.</P>

<H1>The Environmental Lead Laboratory Accreditation Program (ELLAP)</H1>
The Environmental Lead Laboratory Accreditation Program is for laboratories involved with the
analysis of lead in environmental samples.  The EPA estimates that somewhere between 300 and
3,000 accredited laboratories will be needed to perform analyses related to lead-based paint and
matrices contaminated with lead-baesd paint.  ELLAP meets the EPA requirements for
recognition of laboratories as capable of analysis of paint film, soil, and/or dust wipes.<BR>
</HEAD>

<UL>
<LI> <A HREF="#EL2"> What is the ELLAP Program?</A>
<LI> <A HREF="#EL3"> What is the relation between ELLAP and NLLAP?</A>
<LI> <A HREF="#EL4"> What are the program requirements?</A>
<LI> <A HREF="fax.html">Fees and application for the program</A>
</UL>
<BR>
<H2><A NAME="EL2">What is the ELLAP Program?</A></H2>
<P>The Environmental Lead Laboratory Accreditation Program (ELLAP) is an approved lead
laboratory accreditation program under the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National
Lead Laboratory Accreditation Program (NLLAP).</P>
<H2><A NAME="EL3">What is the relation between ELLAP and NLLAP?</A></H2>
<P>AIHA has been formally recognized as an approved lead laboratory accrediting
organization by the EPA NLLAP.  A memorandum of understanding with the EPA declares that
all laboratories accredited by AIHA for the analysis of lead in paint chips, dust wipes, and/or
soil will be recognized by the NLLAP as capable of performing acceptable lead analyses.  To
obtain EPA NLLAP recognition, a laboratory must also participate in the AIHA ELPAT
Program.</P>
<H2><A NAME="EL4">What are the program requirements?</A></H2>
<P> The ELLAP Program contains six main program area requirements:<BR>
<H3>1) Proficiency Testing</H3>
<P>Laboratories seeking AIHA ELLAP accreditation must participate in the ELPAT program
for each lead matrix analyzed by the laboratory.  These proficiency samples will be of varying
concentrations and as real-world as possible.  Proficiency for award of accreditation allows no
outliers reported in the last two consecutive rounds or 25 percent or less cumulative outliers
reported in the last four rounds.  Proficiency is evaluated for each matrix (i.e., paint, soil, dust
wipes) and accreditation may be granted for any combination of matrices.</P>
<H3>2) Personnel Qualification Review</H3>
<P>The laboratory will identify those who function as technical manager, quality assurance
coordinator, and analyst(s), however titled within the laboratory organization.  The technical
manager must have a college degree in chemistry or related science, a minimum of three years
nonacademic analytical chemistry experience, and a minimum of two years nonacademic metals
analysis experience (times may run concurrently).  The quality assurance coordinator must fulfill
one of two equivalent criteria: 1) earned a college degree in a basic science, have one year of
nonacademic analytical chemistry experience, and training in statistics; or 2) four years of
nonacademic analytical chemistry experience and training in statisitics.  Each analyst must
provide documentation of completion of a training course in metals analysis.</P>
<H3>3) Quality Assurance Program Review</H3>
<P> A written quality assurance plan is required and must be submitted for review.  This plan
must include a statistical quality control plan and documentation that statistically-based measures
for accuracy and precision of data from analysis are used.  In addition, matrix-spiked samples of
paint and soil will be analyzed at a frequency of one per batch or at 5 percent per sample batch,
whichever is larger.  Method spike/method duplicates made from blank wipe collection media are
used for wipe sample quality control spike preparation.  One method blank must be analyzed per
sample batch or at 5 percent per sample, whichever is larger.  At least one external reference
standard must be analyzed with each batch.  There are specific requirements for sample log-in,
analysis data documentation, and reporting of results.  Information on these procedures with
instrument calibration and calculation and report review procedures must documented and
presented as part of the application.</P>
<H3>4) Analytical Method Documentation Review</H3>
<P>No specific method is required for accreditation, but analyses shall be conducted using
recognized methods, methods mandated by legal requirements, or methods developed and
validated by the laboratory.  Laboratories must have established performance criteria for
analytical methods and must have documentation demonstrating that the criteria are met.</P>
<H3>5) Facility Review</H3>
<P>The program accredits the laboratory facility, not an individual or an organization.  A
description of the facility, including a floor plan, must be submitted as part of the application. 
Specific instruments or types of instruments are not mandated, but information on, and
identification of, all instruments used must be submitted.  Instrument performance checks and
documentation of maintenance activities are required elements of the ELLAP.  Mobile
laboratories are permitted.</P>
<H3>6) Site Visits</H3>
<P>A trained site visitor will perform an on-site assessment of the laboratory as a representative
of AIHA prior to accreditation.  This prearranged, announced visit is conducted using a checklist
to ensure examination of lead analysis issues.  Site visits are conducted every three years.  Site
visits are conducted every three years.  Site visits for ELLAP may be combined with AIHA
Industrial Hygiene Accreditation program site visits.</P>
<BR>
<BR>
<P>The specific program requirements can be obtained by
requesting the ELLAP Policies and Guidelines from the ELLAP coordinator.

<H2><A NAME="AAR2">Why use the registry?</A></H2>
<P>Analysts involved in the performance of asbestos fiber counts on air samples on the job site
should be a part of this program.  AIHA has the largest statistically valid airborne asbestos
fiber-counting quality control program in the world.</P>
<H2><A NAME="AAR3">Who uses the registry?</A></H2>
<P>People who require qualified counters to analyze their asbestos-containing samples can call
AIHA for a copy of the AIHA Board Approved Analysts Registry Listing.  In addition, copies
of the registry listing are taken to all trade shows in which AIHA participates and are distributed
from the AIHA booth</P>
<H2><A NAME="AAR4">What are the personnel training requirements?</A></H2>
<P>Each analyst must successfully complete one of the recognized courses in asbestos analysis
or its equivalent (e.g., NIOSH 582) and must be able to provide documentation of this
completion.</P>
<P> If an organization uses an in-house training program, this training must be verified by the
use
of a written protocol with performance criteria.  Training should include a minimum of 30 hours
of contact and analytical time by a qualified instructor</P>
<H2><A NAME="AAR5">What are the equipment requirements?</A></H2>

<BODY>
<H1>The Proficiency Analytical Testing (PAT) Program</H1>
<P>The Proficiency Analytical Testing (PAT) Program is designed
to assist a laboratory improve its analytical performance by providing samples on a quarterly
basis, evaluating the results, and providing a report on how well the laboratory performed. 
In the same way, the PAT Program also tests the analytical competence of participating
occupational health laboratories.  Samples are developed and produced by SRI International.
 Data analysis and distribution of reports are performed by NIOSH as permitted under a
Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) with AIHA.</P>
<P>The analytes covered under the PAT Program include: metals, silica, asbestos, and
solvents.</P>

<LI> <A HREF="fax.html">Fees and application for the program</A>
</UL>
<BR>
<BR>
<H2><A NAME="PAT3">Who should participate in the PAT Program?</A></H2>
<P> If a laboratory analyzes samples taken from the workplace environment, then participation
in the in the PAT Program can provide information to clients on laboratory performance.  In
addition, a laboratory must be a part of the PAT Program to participate in AIHA's Laboratory
Industrial Hygiene Accreditation Program.</P>
<H2><A NAME="PAT4">How the program works?</A></H2>
<P> Once enrolled in the program, a laboratory will begin to receive sample kits on a quarterly
basis.  Based on what analyses are performed by the laboratory, these kits contain up to five
silica filters, five asbestos filters, five metals filters, and ten charcoal tubes (four samples, a blank
and five tubes for determination of desorption efficiency). The metals filters contain three metals
(lead, cadmium, zinc, or chromium) which are rotated on the samples that are distributed each
round.  The charcoal tubes contain three organic solvents that are also rotated each round and
include benzene, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, 1,2-dichloroethane, 1,1,1-trichloroethane,
o-xylene, p-dioxane, toluene, trichlorethylene, or tetrachlorethylene.</P>
<H2><A NAME="PAT5">Are special analytical methods required?</A></H2>
<P>The PAT Program does not specify a particular analytical method to be used.  A laboratory
should use the same procedures when analyzing the PAT samples that it would use when
analyzing similar types of samples in normal operations.  This allows the effectiveness of the
analytical methods used by the laboratory to be tested.  Except in instances where analytical
problems are found, PAT samples should be rotated among all analysts performing similar
analyses in the laboratory, results from only one analyst should be reported. Laboratories have
approximately six weeks after receipt of samples to submit results.
</P>
<H2><A NAME="PAT6">What happens after the results are mailed?</A></H2>
<P>The results are evaluated, and all laboratories are screened for those with questionable
performance.  Details of the statistical procedures used by NIOSH to analyze the data are
provided when laboratories enroll in the program.  Each laboratory will be notified of its status
prior to the next round of samples.  AIHA assists laboratories in making corrections and
modifications prior to the next round of sampling by making repeat samples available upon
request. </P>
<H2><A NAME="PAT7">Do all laboratories analyze all the contaminant samples?</A></H2>
<P>An AIHA industrial hygiene accredited laboratory is required to analyze and submit results
for those PAT samples that are similar to the analytical work load of the laboratory, so not all
laboratories will analyze all samples.  Non-accredited laboratories that participate in the PAT
Program analyze one or more of the samples.</P>
<BR>
<H2>Test Samples</H2> 
<P>AIHA offers samples from previous rounds for laboratories wishing to evaluate analytical
procedures
and quality control systems.  Certificate of analysis are provided with the samples to permit
evaluation of how well the laboratory performed.  Kits consist of four concentration levels for
each analyte, which 
include metals, asestos, silica, and solvents.  Blanks are provided with each analyte.</P>

<BODY>
<H1>The Environmental Lead Proficiency Analytical Testing (ELPAT) Program</H1>
<P>The Environmental Lead Proficiency Analytical Testing (ELPAT) Program is designed
to help your laboratory assess and/or improve its analytical performance by providing it
with test samples on a quarterly basis and evaluating the results.  Participation in the
ELPAT Program is open to all laboratories but it is mandatory for laboratories seeking
accreditation by one of the recognized accrediting organizations under EPA's National
Lead Laboratory Accreditation Program (NLLAP).</P>
<P>Matrices under the ELPAT Program include paint chips, soil, dust wipes, and air
samples.</P>

<BR>
<H2> <A NAME="ELPAT3">How the program works?</A></H2>
<P>Once you are enrolled, your laboratory will begin to receive sample kits on a quarterly
basis.  Four concentration levels will be shipped for each of three matrices: paint chips,
soil, and dust wipes.</P>
<P>Paint chip samples are obtained from lead-based paints that have lead sources
representative of the compounds and interferences encountered in field samples.</P>
<P>Soil samples are representative of environmental contamination resulting from lead-based
paint, the industrial use or disposal of lead-based compounds, or airborne lead
emissions.</P>
<P>Dust wipe samples are prepared using field-collected dust samples.  Dust wipe sample
sets include a blank.</P> 
<H2> <A NAME="ELPAT4">Are special analytical methods required?</A></H2>
<P>The ELPAT Program does not specify a particular analytical method to be used.  Your
laboratory must use the same procedure when analyzing similar types of samples in its
normal operations.  ELPAT samples should be rotated among all analysts performing
similar analyses in your laboratory.</P>
<H2> <A NAME="ELPAT5">What happens after the reults are mailed?</A></H2>
<P>Your results will be evaluated using statistical procedures established by NIOSH in
cooperation with the Environmental Lead Laboratory Accreditation Committee (ELLAC). 
You will receive details of the statistical protocol used and examples of output when you
enroll in the ELPAT Program.</P>
<H2> <A NAME="ELPAT6">What are the criteria used for rating my performance?</A></H2>
<P>Performance ratings are based on accumulated results over four rounds (one year).  The
acceptable range is based on consensus values from reference laboratories.  A laboratory's
performance for each matrix is rated as proficient if either of the following criteria are
met:</P>

<TITLE>THE BULK ASBESTOS PROFICIENCY ANALYTICAL TESTING PROGRAM
(BAPAT)
</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>The Bulk Asbestos Proficiency Analytical Testing (BAPAT)
Program</H1>
<P>The Bulk Asbestos Proficiency Analytical Testing Program
serves as an external quality
assurance program for laboratories analyzing bulk building
materials by polarized light
microscopy (PLM).  It is designed to provide bulk audit samples
on a quarterly basis, and to
provide a means by which a laboratory can evaluate its ability to
characterize bulk materials. 
The program is strictly qualitative in nature.

<BR>
<H2><A NAME="BULK3">What are the requirements for the
program?</A></H2>
<P>The BAPAT Program is conducted by the Research Triangle
Institute, under the direction of
AIHA and its Industrial Hygiene Laboratory Accreditation
Committee.  Each round, laboratories
are required to classify samples of bulk building materials as
asbestos-containing or not, and to
identify the asbestos type(s) present in the samples.  In
addition, participants are asked to
provide semi-quantitative estimates of the amount of asbestos
present, and identification and
semi-quantitation of other fibrous and nonfibrous components of
the samples, where possible. 
However, evaluation of the laboratory's performance is based only
on sample classification and
asbestos identification.</P>
<P>Unlike the National Institute of Standards and Technology's
(NIST) National Voluntary
Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP), this program offers no
certification or
accreditation.  For this reason, no on-site visits will be made
to your facility, and no specific
personnel, facility, or test method requirements will be
stipulated by AIHA.  This allows the
freedom for the laboratory to refine analytical techniques, train
new analysts, and improve the
performance of experienced analysts at no risk to the
laboratory's AIHA or NVLAP
credentials.</P>
<H2><A NAME="BULK4">What do participants receive?</A></H2>
<P>Participating laboratories will receive four samples in each
of four quarterly test rounds. 
These samples, the great majority of which are "real-world"
materials from abatement projects,
may contain any of the asbestos types in a variety of matrices
and binders typical of bulk
building and insulation materials.  Materials known to pose
difficulties to laboratories, such as
those containing low asbestos percentages or asbestos
"look-alike" fibers, as well as nonfriable
materials such as vinyl tile and cementitious or asphalyic
products, are frequently used.  These
samples remain the property of the laboratory and can serve both
as in-house quality control
samples and quantitation calibration reference samples. 
Laboratories are allowed one calendar
month in which to complete their analyses and submit their
results.</P>
<P>At the conclusion of each test round, each laboratory will
receive an extensive report of the
analysis that summarizes its results, provides the qualitative
and semi-quantitative reference
values for the samples, and includes a summary of the overall
performance of all laboratories
participating in the round.  Difficulties with the analysis of
specific samples in that round are
addressed, and suggestions for improving the laboratory's
qualitative and semi-quantitative
analyses are offered.  These reports are distributed one calendar
month after the results submittal
deadline so that the participant receives performance and
analysis feedback in as timely a manner
as possible.</P>

<H2><A NAME="AAT5">How does the AAT program work?</A></H2>
<P> When an organization enrolls in the AAT Program, each analyst is assigned an ID number
and sample kits are sent out quarterly.  One sample kit can serve up to five analysts.  Sample
analysis must be performed using the latest version of the NIOSH 7400 method for counting
fibers.  Analytical procedures must be in compliance with the OSHA asbestos standard, CFR
1910.1001.</P>

<H2><A NAME="passmoni">Passive Monitor PAT Sampler
Program</A></H2>
<P>AIHA's new passive monitor PAT sampler program is open to all
PAT participating
laboratories, and AIHA is gauging laboratory interest in
participating in the first two
practice rounds of the program.</P>
<P>It's anticipated that two rounds per year with two badges per
round will be sent to
participating laboratories.  Initially, benzene, toluene, and
xylene will be used. 
Concentrations will be reported in ppm using manufacturers
information on diffusion and
concentration factors.  Costs haven't been established yet, but
it's estimated the price will
be $185 per round.</P>
<P> Interested laboratories also must identify the manufacturer
badge it wants to use
during the trial period: 3M, SKC, or Assay Technology. 
Eventually, accredited laboratories
that currently accept passive monitors for organic analysis will
be required to participate
in the passive monitor PAT sample.</P>
<P><B>To express interest in participating in the second practice
round of the passive monitor
PAT sample program,
contact Anna Narlis-Griffin at (703) 849-8888;
anarlis@aiha.org</B></P>  
<H2><A NAME="pbair">Lead in Air Under the ELPAT Program</A></H2>
<P>AIHA announces the availability of lead in air proficiency
samples.  Laboratories accredited as part of the ELLAP
that choose to accept lead in
air samples as part of their technical capabilities must enroll
in this program.  Samples will be
mailed quarterly on January 1, April 1, July 1, and October
1.</P>
</P>Note this schedule is different than the other ELPAT
matrices.  Results will be reported to
NIOSH and a detailed report will be sent approximately one month
after receipt of results. 
Laboratories desiring to add lead in air to their ELLAP
accreditation will be provided with an air
volume, be required to calculate the air concentration, and must
report the lead results on a
special
form.  In addition, an updated application, including appropriate
QA/QC information covering
the
lead in air matrix, must be submitted to AIHA and two consecutive
rounds with no more than
one
outlier will have to be reported to be considered proficient. 
Laboratories currently enrolled in the
PAT Program for metals will be required to report the lead
results twice; once for the PAT
Program and once for the ELPAT Program.  Separate forms will be
provided.</P>
<P>Laboratories interested in this program must notify Carl Bell
at AIHA (703) 849-8888. 
There
will be no additional charge for laboratories already enrolled in
the PAT Program for
metals.</P>
<BR>
<H2><A NAME="empat">Environmental Microbiology Proficiency
Analytical Testing
(EMPAT)
Program.</A></H2>
<P>The purpose of the program is
performance evaluation of environmental Microbiology
laboratories.  It has been developed for
microbiology laboratories specializing in analysis for
microorganisms commonly detected in air,
fluids
and bulk samples collected from schools, offices, hospitals,
industrial, agricultural and other
work
environments.  Environmental microorganisms in the EMPAT program
will include a variety of
fungi
(molds and yeasts) and mesophilic, thermophilic and psychrophilic
bacteria.</P>
<P>The initiation of the EMPAT program is the stepping stone to
an accreditation program for
environmental microbiology laboratories, similar to the current
AIHA accreditation for industrial
hygiene and environmental lead laboratories.  The program will
consist of three sample rounds
per
year.  Each round will include six samples (three bacteria and
three fungi) for microbial isolation
and
identification.</P>
<P>The program for 1997 will consist of 3 sample rounds.  The
first round will be mailed on February 1, the second round June
1, and the third round October 1, 1997.  The evaluation and
reporting fee for participation in this program is $900.  The fee
for the samples, beginning with the February round, is $900 ($300
for each of the three sample rounds).</P>

<TITLE>Lead Accreditation; 402/404C Final Rule Published</TITLE>
</HEAD>
</BODY>
<H1>Lead Accreditation; 402/404C Final Rule Published </H1>
<H3>(Vol 61; #169, p. 45777;
8/29/96)</H3>
<P>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has recently published final rules for
lead-based paint
activities that require all samples be sent for analyses to a laboratory recognized by the EPA as
capable
of performing paint chip, soil, and dust wipe analyses  (EPA: 40CFR Part 745 "Lead
Requirements for
Lead-Based Paint Activities in Target Housing and Child-Occupied Facilities: Final Rule."). 
NLLAP
Recognition under National Lead Laboratory Accreditation Program (NLLAP) will be required
by clients
in order for a laboratory to analyze paint chip, dust, and/or soil samples associated with the
control and
abatement of lead-based paint.  For example, the most recent draft of the HUD Guidelines, now
recommends that laboratories be recognized through the EPA National Lead Laboratory
Accreditation
Program (NLLAP) and that property owners, risk assessors, inspector technicians, and
contractors ensure
that laboratory analyses are performed by an EPA recognized laboratory.<P> 
<P>Under legislative directive of Title X of the Housing and Community Development Act of
1992, the
EPA has established the NLLAP to recognize laboratories performing analysis associated with
lead
abatement.  NLLAP recognition of laboratories analyzing lead in paint chips, soils, and dust
wipes has
two requirements. (1) Successful participation in proficiency testing using real world matrices;
and (2)
laboratory accreditation including on-site assessment of laboratory operations.  NLLAP
requirements are
based upon the recommendations of a Federal Interagency Taskforce on Lead-Based Paint, a
group of 17
federal agencies involved with lead issues, that recognition should be based upon both
proficiency
testing and laboratory accreditation.<P>
<P>Laboratories interested in obtaining accreditation information such as the program
requirements,
time needed to complete the process, and cost should contact the American Industrial Hygiene
Association (AIHA).  Currently, over 100 laboratories are accredited and recognized by NLLAP
as
capable of performing paint chip, soil, and dust wipe analyses.  You should understand that
laboratory
accreditation can take months to achieve.  Laboratory accreditation involves submittal of an
application
including a description of your quality system and manual to the AIHA and an on-site evaluation
of
laboratory operations including equipment, facilities, analytical methods, staff, and internal
quality
control by AIHA assessors.  Only accredited laboratories which are NLLAP recognized are
included on
the list of laboratories used by the National Lead Clearinghouse to refer potential laboratory
clients.<P>
<P>Participation in the ELPAT proficiency testing program will continue to be open to all
interested
laboratories, however, the National Lead Clearinghouse will only provide a list of accredited
laboratories
to prospective laboratory users.  Only laboratories that have been accredited will be NLLAP
recognized
according to the final rules published by EPA.  Therefore, if analysis of lead in paint chip, dust
and soil
samples is important to your laboratory business, it is imperative that your laboratory begin the
accreditation process now.<P>

<H2><CENTER> AMERICAN INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE ASSOCIATION CO-SPONSORS
FIRST TRAVELING MUSEUM EXHIBIT HIGHLIGHTING THE
PROFESSION</CENTER></H2>
<P>
(Washington, Oct. 18, 1996) -- The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA), in
conjunction with the Baltimore Museum of Industry, ACGIH and ABIH, has developed a mobile
exhibit designed to profile the history, development and current work of the industrial hygiene
profession.  Currently hosted by the Baltimore Museum of Industry, this multi-paneled, multi-media exhibit will travel from one museum to another to heighten public awareness of the
industrial hygiene field.
<P>
"I think the exhibit will help reach people, especially young people, and let them know about a
very important profession that improves the quality of their lives, but one they probably never
knew existed," say John Serocki and Linda Rubin, members of the AIHA task force that helped
develop the exhibit.  Colorful photographs, graphics and text illustrate historic workplace perils,
modern environmental hazards and their control, the evolution of industrial hygiene,
occupational health pioneers, and legislation affecting industrial hygiene, including protective
standards and exposure limits.
<P>
Among those joining forces to complete the exhibit are local AIHA sections and individual
AIHA members, the Baltimore City Health Department, Johns Hopkins University's School of
Hygiene and Public Health, and ACGIH.  These parties contributed photographs, historic
instruments, respirators and other industrial hygiene artifacts and documentation.
<P>
For more information on the exhibit, please contact Vanessa Char, Chesapeake Local Section, at
(410) 671-4086 or the Baltimore Museum of Industry at (410) 727-4808.

will be sorely missed.  He was an excellent administrator and a very good ally for the
profession," said Zack Mansdorf, president of AIHA.
<P>
Among his accomplishments, Dear began the reinvention of OSHA and made great strides in
building a bridge between labor and business groups.  A team player, Dear's leadership was
potent as well as timely.
<P>
AIHA has worked to maintain a strong relationship with OSHA and is looking forward to
continuing a tradition of good will with Dear's successor.

<H2><CENTER> AIHA OFFERS NON-CONFINING KNOWLEDGE ON CONFINED
SPACE ENTRY</H2></CENTER>
<P>
(Washington, December 27, 1996) -- A new AIHA Press publication, <I>Field Guidelines for
Temporary Ventilation of Confined Spaces with an Emphasis on Hotwork</I>, addresses an
important and sometimes overlooked aspect of confined space entry. Overhead slides that can be
used for training are included with this unique resource.
<P>
These field guidelines, particularly useful as an educational tool for employees with limited
ventilation training, provide examples of techniques for successful ventilation of confined spaces
where hotwork such as welding or thermal cutting produces fumes and gases requiring removal.

maximize effectiveness of confined space ventilation and provide for compliance with relevant
OSHA ventilation requirements for hotwork; designed to encourage use on the job site by project
supervisors and planners, IHs, safety professionals and others responsible for ventilating
confined spaces; and examples are oriented toward ventilation of vessels in petrochemical plants,
but are useful in virtually all facilities.
<P>
<I>Field Guidelines for Temporary Ventilation of Confined Spaces with an Emphasis on
Hotwork</I> is available for $48 to AIHA members and $60 to nonmembers. Call AIHA
Support Services at (703) 849-8888 to order or for a free AIHA Publications Catalog.

<BODY>
<H1>An Ergonomics Approach to Avoiding Musculoskeletal Injury</H1>
Working Americans spend about 2000 hours a year in the workplace. Not surprisingly, all these
hours can take a toll on your eyes, your back, your hands, your neck.
<P>
Exposure to adverse working conditions can result in momentary pain or long-term injury.
Moreover, poorly designed working environments contribute to reduced efficiency, decreased
production, loss of income, increased medical claims, and permanent disability. Fortunately,
professionals like the members of the American Industrial Hygiene Association use a science
called
"ergonomics" to help remedy the conditions that cause occupational disorders and injuries.
<P>
The goal of ergonomics is to design the workplace so that it accommodates human capabilities to
prevent problems such as injuries. We will examine several of the risk factors that affect
employees,
as well as solutions that you and your employer can use to eliminate or lessen these conditions.
Naturally, there are additional problems specific to certain industries, but this brochure will give
you an overview of many of today's most common occupational disorders. 
<P>
<H3> The following topics are covered in the brochure: </H3>
<UL>
<LI>Let Your Fingers Do the Walking . . .
<LI>What CTDs Are Not
<LI>How CTDs Occur
<LI>How Ergonomics Can Help
<LI>Making Your Computer Truly "User-Friendly"

<H1> Is Lead a Problem in My Home? </H1>

Recently, many stories alerting parents to the potential danger of lead in and around their homes
have appeared in the media.  Unfortunately, practical advice to parents on how to protect
themselves and their children has not been widely available.
<P>
While public and private research organizations are working to come up with better ways to deal
with the presence of lead in the environment and to protect people from the hazard it represents,
no one has all the answers.
<P>
The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) has produced this informational brochure
to help parents, homeowners, and concerned tenants take steps to determine whether lead is a
problem in their home or communities and identify resources to help reduce exposure.
<P>
<H3> The following topics are covered in the brochure: </H3>
<UL>
<LI> Where does the lead come from?
<LI> How does lead get into our bodies?
<LI> Who can be hurt the most from lead in and around your home?
<LI> What are some of the signs of lead poisoning?
<LI> Are my children at risk of having lead poisoning?
<LI> How can I tell if my home is safe?
<LI> How can I have my home tested?
<LI> What can I do if there is lead in or around my house?
<LI> If my house has old lead paint, can I take care of the problem myself?
<LI> Title X of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992

<H1> Is Indoor Air Quality a Problem in My Home? </H1>

The subject of indoor air pollution or "sick building syndrome" has received a great deal of
attention in recent years.  Although most of the concern originally focused on the workplace,
more people are looking for answers to health and comfort problems occurring in their homes.
<P>
The American Industrial Hygiene Association has produced this brochure to help homeowners,
landlords, and tenants of single-family dwellings recognize and respond to indoor air quality
problems.  Much of the information presented here applies to apartment buildings as well, but
often, only the apartment building owner or manager can remedy the problem.
<P>
You can prevent or resolve many problems with common sense and a little knowledge of
potential air pollutant sources and building systems.  This brochure cannot address all of the
potential problems in the indoor environment.  You should also be aware that indoor air quality
problems may be due to more than one cause and that health problems may not necessarily be
caused by the indoor environment.  For these reasons, industrial hygienists and other
environmental health scientists will continue to research these complex issues.
<P>
<H3> The following topics are covered in the brochure: </H3>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>What is Indoor Air Quality?
<LI>Can Poor Indoor Air Quality Cause Serious Health Problems?
<LI>What You Can Do to Control Indoor Air Pollutants 
<LI>Chemicals in the Home
<LI>How Can Building Materials and Furnishings Affect Indoor Air?
<LI>What About Mold and Mildew?
<LI>What if You Cannot Control the Source?
<LI>Testing Your Indoor Air Quality

<H1> Do I Work in a Sick Building? </H1>

Indoor air quality (IAQ) is the subject of much attention these days, and for good reason.  There
is more and more evidence that the quality of the indoor environment can have profound effects
on the health of building occupants.  The World Health Organization estimates that up to 30
percent of office buildings worldwide may have significant problems with 10 to 30 percent of the
occupants of the buildings experiencing health effects which are, or are perceived to be, related
to poor IAQ.
<P>
Although serious health problems related to IAQ are rare, the perception of endangered health is
increasingly common among building occupants.  In the United States, the National Institute for
Occupational Safety and Health recently had 3,000 telephone calls relating to poor IAQ in a
single week, 90 percent requesting investigations of the buildings they occupy or manage.
<P>
The causes and consequences of poor IAQ are a long way from being completely understood.  It
has been the experience of the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) that building
owners, managers, employers and occupants want to know more about the issue than has been
provided by the news media, whose stories have generally raised fears without offering solutions.
<P>
AIHA has developed this brochure to provide building owners, managers and occupants with a
summary of the current state of knowledge on IAQ.  The goal of this brochure is to inform the
reader so that you can make intelligent decisions about the present condition of your building.
<P>
<H3> The following topics are covered in the brochure: </H3>
<UL>
<LI> What is good indoor air quality?
<LI> What are common complaints about IAQ?
<LI> When are IAQ complaints most likely?
<LI> What are common sources of IAQ problems?
<LI> Why is ventilation important?
<LI> What can be done about IAQ complaints?
<LI> When should air testing be done?
<LI> How can IAQ problems be prevented?
<LI> What can be done to control indoor air contaminants?
<LI> When should I seek outside help?

Although some occupations may appear more dangerous than others, potential short-term and
long-term health hazards occur in every profession, whether a person is employed as a banker or
a construction worker.  Industrial hygienists play an important role in ensuring that the
workplace if as free from hazards as possible and that the workers and the members of the
community are protected from potential health threats.
<P>
As our world moves through the "information age," where new, possibly hazardous technologies
are emerging every day, the industrial hygienist' job function becomes more valuable to the
health and well-being of workers, the community, and the environment.
<P>
Although more schools are offering undergraduate programs in industrial hygiene than before,
the industrial hygiene curriculum is not always available in colleges and universities across the
United States.  When and industrial hygiene major is not available, industrial hygienists
generally prepare for their careers by pursuing an undergraduate degree in one of the sciences,
such as engineering, chemistry, biology, etc.  Many then continue on to attain a master's or
doctoral degree in industrial hygiene.
<P>
<H3> The following topics are covered in the brochure: </H3>
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Definition and Background of the Profession
<LI> The Development of Industrial Hygiene as a Profession
<LI> Job Diversity within the Industrial Profession 
<LI> Preparing for a Career in Industrial Hygiene

You have probably seen on T.V. or heard about at least one unfortunate shipping accident that
leaked hazardous materials into the ocean and onto the shore.  You probably realized many fish
and birds were hurt because of it.  Were you worried about what could happen to the people in
the community?
<P>
Many of you use computers or have seen your parents use them.  When you worked at a
computer for a long time, have you wondered why your eyes hurt or why your hands or back
might be sore after typing?
<P>
The men and women who help protect workers are called INDUSTRIAL HYGIENISTS.  They
help keep the workers safe who clean up after a chemical or oil spill.  They make sure the people
living in the surrounding communities are safe and healthy.  Industrial hygienists also do things
like test better ways for people to work at computers.
<P>
These two things seem different, but they are both part of the industrial hygienist's job. 
Industrial hygienists help people protect themselves on the job and off.

<H1> Mentoring Minority Youth through AIHA</H1>
<P>
The American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) and the AIHA Foundation have
committed to a three-year action plan designed to increase diversity within the ranks of
occupational and environmental health and safety.  To achieve this goal, AIHA has embarked on
an ambitious mentoring program for minority youth.  Minority high school students, specially
selected based on their academic achievement and interest in science, will be matched up with
AIHA members in their communities.  We believe that these youths will benefit from the insight
and wisdom of experienced professionals, and in turn consider occupational and environmental
health and safety as a career.
<P>
A targeted number of AIHA local sections will be working in conjunction with a national
not-for-profit organization called INROADS, Inc..  This group, founded in 1970, has found great
success placing college-age students in internship and mentoring programs around the country. 
Nearly 5,000 students have graduated from the INROADS internship program so far.  The
majority were offered jobs with the companies for which they interned, a testament to the
program's success.
<P>
Through its Pre-College Component, INROADS offers organizations like AIHA the opportunity
to reach out to the minority community even earlier when so many important life decisions are
being made.  It is at this age that a mentor can have a profound impact on the choices of a young
person, including college, field of study, consideration of graduate school, and career path.
<P>
The AIHA Foundation has received a grant from Exxon, matched with funds from the National
Environmental Education and Training Foundation, to fund the activities under this outreach
program.  In cases where INROADS does not have a local coordinating office to assist the AIHA
local section, these guidelines will assist members in setting up the program themselves.
<P>
In addition to the goal of increasing minority representation in the field of occupational and
environmental health and safety, AIHA's other goals include:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Fostering the development of interest in environmental health and safety;
<LI>Providing educational information on career opportunities; and
<LI>Providing a concrete action plan for community outreach.
</UL>
<P>
AIHA wants to work closely with its members to achieve these goals.  A limited amount of
funding is available for local sections to use in mentor-related activities, such as mailings to
recruit members to serve as mentors, the development of materials, hosting a social function for
mentors and students, etc.  The AIHA Member Services Division should be contacted directly to
discuss funding possibilities.
<P>
Attaining the long-term goals set by AIHA will take time and effort on the part of AIHA
members, but we believe that both the mentors and the students will find the program gratifying. 
We look forward to working with local sections and members on this worthwhile endeavor.
