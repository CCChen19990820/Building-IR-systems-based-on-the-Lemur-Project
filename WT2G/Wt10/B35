<FONT SIZE=+1><P align = center><B>The Downtown Real Estate Market is Picking Up, But Real Growth Remains to be Seen</B></FONT SIZE><br><i><B>By Ray Marano</B></i>
<p>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B> </B></FONT SIZE><br>
When Joe Blattner started shopping for a new home for his growing advertising and public relations firm a year and a half ago, his expectations were rather modest. 
<P> 
But  after about six months of looking and bartering, Blattner/Brunner ended up in 17,000 square feet at plush One Oxford Centre in April 1994 -- paying just $1.50 a square foot more than the agency was paying for 11,700 square feet on two floors at  814 Penn Avenue in the cultural district. 
<P>
Blattner considers himself and the firm fortunate. 
<P> 
"If I were doing it today, I probably wouldn't get the deal I have now," says Blattner. 
<P>
He's probably right. For the past year, downtown office rental rates have steadily climbed back from a steep drop in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a kickback from the glut of office   space dumped into the market due to corporate downsizing. The resulting lag in demand caused the reconsideration of several downtown construction projects (read: scratched) -- a move that local politicos often hail as the wisdom that saved Pittsburgh's real estate market from the tubes down which many other urban areas tumbled. 
<P>
Now, that wisdom has the potential to curtail corporate relocating downtown. Although there is still space available, according to leasing agents, and some good deals as well, there is a pinch in downtown class A space, the poshest, most modern accommodations for corporate renters. And while by everyone's account the market for downtown office space has tightened and shows no visible signs of loosen-ing any time soon, demand has, to this point, still not spurred downtown construction. 
<P>
<h2>Bigger Isn't Better </h2>
Large corporations seeking class A space, in particular, have problems.  A report compiled by local commercial real estate firm Arnheim & Neely Oncor International says that there are good opportunities for users who need up to 20,000 square feet of class A space, but corporate users seeking bigger blocks will find less to choose from. 
<P>
When Blue Cross of Western Pennsylvania, for example, wanted to consolidate 1,250 employees from operations in several buildings downtown into a single 300,000-square-foot location, they had to get creative. Jim Baumgartner, president of Standard Property Corp., a Blue Cross affiliate charged with securing the new space for the health insurance behemoth, says current market conditions, which still offer good opportunities for renters, played a part in the company's decision to consolidate. But most importantly, leases in any of Blue Cross' downtown locations will terminate in the fourth quarter of 1996. Bringing operations under a single roof and a single lease agreement should allow the corporation to use space more cost-effectively. 
<P>
"That's one of our goals, and we do believe that will occur," says Baumgartner. <P>With existing space of the ilk needed hard to come by in such quantity, the company chose to revamp the Lazarus department store building, which is tethered to Blue Cross' Fifth Avenue Place offices by a skywalk. The renovation, which will be done by Oxford Development Co., will reportedly cost $49 million, $20 million of which will come from public funds. Lazarus will move to a new location, being constructed at a cost of $67 million, at the corner of Fifth and Wood. 
<P>
The Arnheim & Neely report notes that while class B space is a little less scarce, the trickle-down caused by brisk demand for class A space and upgrades of some class B space to attract tenants in the stronger market has squeezed that category, too. Class C space, by comparison, is experiencing lagging demand but offers substantial concessions to tenants and favorable rental rates. 
<P>
The demand for class B space seems to be surging this year. Jeremy Kronman with Gold & Co. says that six months ago, two of the Downtown properties he handles were at 80 percent occupancy. Now, they are filled to capacity. Four others have jumped from 75 percent to 95 percent occupied during the same period. "We're seeing some creative uses of space," Kronman says, pointing to a 110,000-square-foot, three-floor renovation in the Westin William Penn Hotel that is marketed as 555 Grant Street and stands fully leased. "A year ago, people didn't know it was there," says Kronman. 
<P>
One change affecting the market is that there are more, smaller clients. Corporate downsizing and small business creation are having their effect on the office rental industry. Leasing out 555 Grant Street, for example, entailed lining up a dozen tenants instead of two, as might have been the case in the past, with most taking 2,000 to 5,000 square feet. Some took less than 1,000 square feet. 
<P>
The creative uses Kronman describes, it seems, offer some good opportunities for companies that have managed to sustain growth and over the years have placed operations in offices throughout downtown and the suburbs. 
<P>
<H2>A Seller's Market </H2>
What's driving the landlord's market, especially for class A space? Fundamentally, it seems, the lack of major new downtown office construction in the Golden Triangle. Paired with an upswing in demand from a surging economy, this is locking up chunks of space and making it more difficult for renters to find desirable space. 
<P>
"The class A market's going to get even tighter, and that's going to make B space even more attractive," says David Knight, president of Allegheny Center Associates. <P>Strong demand for class A accommodations and downsizing companies looking for bargains in spiffed-up class B space seem to have shored up both office space categories. 
<P>
Take for instance the Federal Home Loan Bank, which moved from class A space to class B quarters in the former Porter Building, and Fiserv, which made a similar switch to the Comstock Building. Both achieved better visibility in the market and got lower rents. 
<P>
But this is often not the quality of office space that well-heeled tenants desire. Quality, a lack of contiguous spaces for large tenants and little chance of a major new development in 1995 tilts the table in favor of the landlords. 
<P>
That is increasingly reflected in the market. Rental rates and occupancies inched upward by the end of 1994, with class A space asking rates in the $20 to $22 level. Rates have continued to climb, with leasing agents reporting some class A space pushing $25 a square foot. Occupancy rates for class A space were around 88 percent. Class B space, which saw stronger activity during 1994, demanded about $14 by year's end, and showed occupancy levels at around 85 percent. 
<P> 
But though rental rates have firmed up significantly, they still haven't reached a level that would entice developers to risk a major new downtown office building. The consensus is that current lease rates are about $8 to $10 below the $30 a square foot it would take to justify major new construction in the central business district. Jon Harrigan of Pennsylvania Commercial Real Estate calls the difference between current rental rates and what developers need to pull the trigger for new construction "a giant chasm." 
<P>
Harrigan and others say there is an aching need for new class A space. "What the trend is saying is we're ready for a large chunk of space and if we don't get it, people will get pigeon-holed where they are," Harrigan says. And despite the supply of sublease and renovated B space coming onto the market, Harrigan says some tenants want a particular type of space that fits their needs. "People will say there is the Gimbel's building, the Alcoa building," Harrigan says, "but tenants are inclined not to consider facilities that won't suit their purposes." 
<P>
While no one is panicking yet, there's some concern that a shortage of class A space could cramp the downtown and perhaps hurt the city. If a major tenant can't find a large space in the city and isn't willing to wait the two or three years necessary for new construction, a big fish might get away. One broker talked of a client who looked at Pittsburgh but didn't put the city on its short list because it couldn't find the 60,000 square feet of contiguous space it needed for a 500-employee operation. 
<P>
As the market gets tighter, the problem could become more acute. 
<P> 
"It's a problem that is building, there's no doubt about it," says Don Pulver, chief executive officer of Oliver Tyrone Pulver of Philadelphia, the developer of the Cultural Trust's proposed office tower at Penn Avenue and Seventh Street. Pulver wants to stack the deck in favor of the project successfully securing financing by pre-leasing at least 90 percent of the building. But even assuming, best case scenario, that the building gets off the ground next year, by the time it is completed the newest buildings in the city -- Fifth Avenue Place and CNG Tower -- will be a decade old. 
<P> 
<H2>Cementing Commitments </H2>
Pulver's on the right track. Lenders, wary of the volatility that real estate demonstrated as an investment vehicle in the late 1980s and early 1990s, insist that developers get firm pre-leasing commitments for large portions of new buildings before they agree to bankroll construction, to prove the project's merit. They've upped the ante on developers, pressing them to assume more risk for the project, and to provide more equity to wrap up a financing package. They are looking hard at developers' credit worthiness and paring down amortization schedules. While a 20- or 25-year mortgage term was common a decade or so ago, 15 years is more the norm today. 
<P>
"The reality today is that the sponsor is taking more of the risk than he was 10 years ago," says Charles D'Amico, first vice president with Mellon Bank. 
<P>
That reality has translated into a standstill for new office construction activity downtown. The $100 million City Centre, a project that has been on the boards for Grant Street  for the last five years, is still in a hole behind Mellon Bank Center. But for lack of any major tenant commitment, it  won't happen this year -- or next. 
<P>
By contrast, the outlook for the $40 million Cultural District office tower seems a lot brighter. Pulver feels confident that he can snag a major tenant or two this year. Once the lead tenants are lined up, Pulver believes, others will follow suit. 
<P>
"We're still in the pre-leasing phase and have a number of what I would call good prospects," says Pulver, adding that there are about 10 prospective renters, most from the Pittsburgh area, who are interested in the new building. 
<P> 
No one seems to think the more stringent requirements lenders are demanding are necessarily bad, even though they aren't  making development easy. 
<P> 
"I think it has more of an upside because you have developers in a position where they really have to justify their projects," said real estate consultant Carrie Holstead. 
<P>
What does a tighter market mean for tenants? In addition to paying more for space, renters are being asked to commit to longer leases. While three-year term leases were the norm a few years ago, leasing agents say landlords are asking for five or more years on agreements in the more brisk market. Concession packages, the deal sweeteners used to lure tenants in leaner times, aren't as generous as they used to be. Moving allowances and free rent have begun to dry up. 
<P>
"Tenants remember the articles about free rent that were appearing as recently as two years ago," says one leasing agent. "Brokers talk about it, and little tenants want it, but they aren't getting it." 
<P>
<H2>Fringe Benefits </H2>
Suburban and fringe markets are posing a challenge to the downtown. Suburban landlords are luring tenants with the promise of less congestion and the perception of a safer environment, not to mention more attractive rents, convenient parking and lower taxes. <P>Some not-so-distant properties are challenging the Golden Triangle for renters. For the big-space tenant who doesn't need a prestigious address, facilities like Allegheny Center are a strong pull. 
<P>
"I can still do 100,000 square feet on one floor if someone needs to do that," says Allegheny Center's Knight. Allegheny Center, which is in the process of renovating its former retail storefronts into offices, offers tenants "B-plus" space. 
<P>
"The guy who wants to be in a class A space downtown isn't coming to Allegheny Center," Knight concedes, but he points out that Allegheny Center offers parking at $2.75 a day, and lease rates that are in the $55 per month range. 
<P>
There will certainly be other opportunities opening up. Alcoa's move to a build-to-suit North Side facility will throw an additional 110,000 square feet of space onto the open market. Another 100,000 square feet of space will come onto the market as a result of just ordinary activity,  leases up and companies moving, and that will increase supply as well.
<P>
But stiff competition continues from the suburban and fringe markets. Healthy demand in the Parkway West corridor has the occupancy rate in  class A space at about 94 percent. The shortage of large blocks of contiguous class A space downtown has pushed development out to the suburbs into build-to-suit facilities. Companies looking for space in the west, such as Legent Corp., Colonial Insurance and Roadway Packaging Systems,  found that their only alternative was to build. 
<P>
<H2>Opportunity Knocks </H2>
What's on the horizon? Arnheim & Neely Oncor International forecasts that leases on about 10 million square feet of office space in the Pittsburgh market will expire in 1995 and 1996, swelling demand for space. 
<P>
Still, Pennsylvania Commercial Real Estate's Harrigan thinks that tenants, even though they're paying more, are coming out ahead. As evidence, he says that class A space rates in the '70s reached $26 to $28. 
<P>
"If you look at the rates over time, the tenants have benefited," he says. 
<P>
Building owners, after taking a beating on values in recent years, have benefited too. Selling prices for downtown properties dipped from $68 a square foot in 1988 to $11 a square foot in 1993. Now, prices have rebounded to about $28, bolstered mostly by the higher rental and occupancy rates. Jeffrey Holroyd with Arnheim & Neely Oncor International  says longer-held properties, are going on the block in response to stronger prices. "Now, suddenly, there are viable properties out there," says Holroyd. 
<P>
If there is a single word that describes the downtown market for office space, it is opportunity. Tenants with conventional needs might have to scramble to find the space they need, but they're likely to get it at reasonable and realistic prices. Landlords can expect to get more realistic rents for their properties, while building owners who took advantage of depressed prices in past years can look forward to reaping solid profits in the future. Finally, developers who can prove the worth of a project by securing commitments from tenants who are willing to bet that a building will go up will be undertaking solid projects that the market genuinely needs.                      
<P>

<h2>Office Market Classifications</h2>
Unfamiliar with real estate? The following defines the classifications, gives examples of prominent buildings in that class and the average rental rate per square foot that category commanded at mid-year 1995. 
<P>
<B>Class A</B> -- Excellent location and access to the major financial and commercial districts of the city; professionally maintained and managed; with state-of-the-art building systems; functional floor plate. Gulf Building, Koppers Building, CNG Tower, One Mellon Bank Center. Average rent: $21.37/square foot. 
<P>
<B>Class B</B> -- Good to fair location; professionally managed, generally older buildings showing a slight functional or economic obsolescence. Allegheny Center, Law and Finance Building, Oliver Building. Average rent: $14.95/square foot. 
<P>
<B>Class C</B> -- Buildings in need of repair and/or renovation; usually located outside the more desirable business areas; rental rates below the average market rates which reflect economic and physical deterioration. Standard Life Building, Investment Building, Fulton Building. Average rent: $12.20/square foot.

<h2>Concerns About Clean Air Are Choking Economic Development</h2>This summer's intense heat did more than singe a few flower gardens. As temperatures escalated, the region's chances of being redesignated an Attainment Area under the Clean Air Act diminished and so did our prospects for a vibrant economy. <P> The Clean Air Act designated much of this region as a Moderate Non-Attainment Area. At issue is ground level ozone, a key component of smog. This area has too much ground level ozone. Hence, the area is classified as a Moderate Non-Attainment Area and is included in the Northeast Ozone Transport Region. The result:  Our businesses and other businesses considering whether to locate here face expensive and burdensome requirements. <P>A company locating in Pennsyl-vania that emits certain pollutants known as NOx and VOC must purchase emission credits equivalent to 115% of its own emissions. The credits are difficult to find and expensive to purchase. Sony spent $3 million on credits it would not have needed if it located in West Virginia or Ohio. <P> It gets worse. The EPA also requires manufacturers in this region to install Reasonably Available Control Technology at a hefty cost of $1500 per ton of pollutants. <P>Neither of our neighboring states are included in the Ozone Transport Region, making them significantly more appealing sites for manufacturing concerns to locate.  Pennsylvania is at a disadvantage. <P> But don't think Ohio and West Virginia are doing a better job of controlling emissions. In fact, Pennsylvania's air quality problems are substantially attributable to emissions from Ohio and West Virginia.<BR>Business people can and should impact our region's attainment status. First, they can urge their Congressmen to work toward making the standards for ozone attainment more reasonable. By eliminating the unfair advantage that Ohio, West Virginia and other states have, Pennsylvania would no longer bear an unfair share of the air quality problem. <P> Furthermore, enterprises bearing disproportionate costs because they operate in a Non-attainment Area should plea their cases collectively. Legislators do not  fully understand the magnitude of the region's non-attainment status. Quantifications of the impact will mobilize change. <P> We must unite in efforts to move  our region toward ozone attainment. Erasing the legislatively imposed air quality boundaries between Pennsylvania and its neighbors will advance economic development and enable all of us to breathe easier.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B><P align=center>Ridge's Plan to Improve business Climate Requires voter Patience</FONT SIZE></B>
<b><i> By Jim Urban - Editor-in-Chief</i></b>
<P>
Gov. Tom Ridge says he wants to make Pennsylvania a better place to do business. He proclaimed that intent every night during his campaign last year. You remember the television commercial -- standing in a town square, microphone in hand, railing on the state's dismal business atmosphere. 
<P> 
Approaching the end of his first year in office, Ridge already has made some progress, cutting the corporate income tax by 1 percent and taming what was once a mercenary Depart-ment of Environmental Resources. It's likely Ridge will accomplish even more, but I wonder whether the voters, who tend to gauge success by the number of jobs created, will even notice. 
<P>
Some voters may not notice, because Ridge's strategy is likely to drive gradual job growth over his years in office rather than causing a big bang. Translation: The headlines won't be as dramatic. In fact, headlines may be few.
<p>
"The long-term implications for Pennsylvania's workers probably won't be as visible," Ridge himself concedes in the interview that begins on page 34 of this magazine. Asked if voters will notice, "I hope so," the governor replied. 
<P>
A lack of headlines doesn't mean Ridge's strategy isn't a sound one. The worst kind of governor would be one who is banking on the big bangs -- Sony, for example -- to drive job growth. Until there is change with other factors over which Ridge has little control, such as the burdensome Clean Air Act regulations stifling Pennsylvania businesses, corporations have little motivation to locate a manufacturing center in our region. Many don't even consider looking here. Others would like to locate here but cannot because of the impact such a move would have on profit margin. 
<P>
So it is logical to build from the base we already have in Pennsylvania, as Ridge is proposing to do. The governor wants to further ease corporate taxes and regulation while reforming workers' compensation and maximizing exports. 
<P> 
The strategy is especially crucial to our region, where job growth is limited at best. Small- and medium-sized businesses are driving our economy, yet the rate of new business start-ups and entrepreneurships lags well behind the national average. 
<P> 
In 1994, the Center for Enterprise Development ranked Pennsylvania dead last nationally in "entrepreneurial energy." The rank is a result of a combination of three factors: Pennsylvania ranked 45th for the rate of new com-pany formation, 49th for the rate of change in the formation rate and 33rd for the rate of job growth in new companies less than four years old. 
<P>
It gets worse: Western Pennsyl-vania lags behind the state when comparing new company formations. A University of Pittsburgh study showed the region's new company formation rate proceeding about 25 percent slower than the dismal statewide rate. About 3,400 new companies are formed in the region each year, half of where we would be if we reached the national average. 
<P> 
It doesn't help that many native western Pennsylvanians in the prime entrepreneurial age group of 25 to 34 have relocated to places like northern Virginia, Boston and Cleveland. Only 15 percent of our population is in the prime entrepreneurial age range, compared to other regions that typically have over 20 percent of their population in that age group. Perhaps The Enterprise Corporation of Pittsburgh said it best in its 1994 report: "Our acorns are on some other region's oak trees or are already sprouting somewhere else."
<P>
Ridge's agenda, as he points out in the interview with ER, is geared in part toward convincing existing Pennsylvania businesses to expand here instead of looking elsewhere. When that happens, jobs will be here and so will the young, talented individuals who will drive our economy in the future when they form their own entrepreneurships. 
<P> 
In the short term, up next on Ridge's agenda is an issue that is crucial to increasing the rate of small business creation: workers' compensation. Don't expect a big bang, but expect some progress that will favor business. With-out reform, Ridge knows more and more businesses will set up shop across the Ohio border. That's not the kind of job growth he wants or seeks. 
<P>
Ridge has a solid plan. What he needs is some time to see it through. In the meantime, the headlines probably won't trum-pet sudden job growth. But remember, that doesn't mean that job growth is not occurring.
<P>

<HR>
<h2>Workers' Comp Reform: Be Careful of What You Wish For</h2>Employers throughout the Commonwealth are raising their voices in unison, pleading for workers' compensation reform. Insistence on reform, however, is where the unison stops. Each employer wants to change his or her own unique perception of the problem. <P> In stressing the need for change, employers describe anecdotal case histories and voice their anger about a system gone awry. Stories range from the employee who worked only a few days prior to claiming a work injury, to the televised footage of the individual who, while receiving workers' compensation, performed physical labor that was videotaped by "60 Minutes."<BR>While government officials and legislators listen to the drone of employer groups with one ear, they lend their other ear to constituents from the other side who detail the plight of the worker wrongfully denied medical care and wage benefits when arbitrary decisions deny coverage. <P>Like weary parents trying to mediate the arguments of cranky children, legislators find that no solution satisfies everyone's needs. Broad and far reaching reform to control and manage costs is necessary. Integrating workers' compensation programs with short- and long-term disability and healthcare coverage (24-hour coverage) seem to be logical solutions. With agreement as to the need for control, and reform of the medical portion that Act 44 of 1993 brought to workers' compensation, why is everyone still unhappy?<BR>You remember Act 44. This reform provides opportunity for true managed care, granting employers the right to contract with a PPO, HMO or CCO, and to direct care for 14 to 30 days. It codifies peer review of medical care (URO). Act 44 also enacts a statewide medical fee schedule, which, though complicated, reduces medical payments by about 35 percent. That's a measurable savings. <P>Act 44 clearly presents employers with the opportunity for radical change in the way they manage and pay for medical care. However, in order to benefit from the opportunity for a truly integrated workers' compensation managed care program, employers and carriers have to redesign their organizational structure, as well as the responsibilities of departments and persons. Redesign means change in the way some decisions are made, as well as changing who or which department makes decisions. <P>The workers' compensation system is extremely complicated. There are many stakeholders, and each stakeholder may have valid reasons for resisting change impacting their area of responsibility. When the proposed change requires giving up a known  and proven pattern of decision making, file handling and accountability in favor of complete unknown, resistance becomes more entrenched.<BR>The workers' compensation manager who undertakes the planning and staging of radical change, such as implementing a true managed care program by contracting with an HMO, PPO or CCO, is venturing into un-charted territory. Taking on the responsibility for initiating such a program would be comparable to loading four children into the family car, with no destination, road map or reservations, and heading off for a two-week vacation. Depending upon one's tolerance for uncertainty, this could sound like an exhilarating challenge, or a frightening nightmare. <P>If radical change is implemented, works well, and the outcome shows savings, then the manager is recognized as being successful and is targeted for future opportunities. <P>On the other hand, if the implementation is not well designed, if there is not top down commitment and a spirit of team work, then the attempt to implement radical change could result in fragmentation, poor morale and chaos. The manager who leads this charge will soon be preparing a resume for another position. <P>Alas, what the legislature truly accomplished with Act 44 of 1993 was comprehensive, yet compromise legislation. The ultimate irony of Act 44 is that it provides the employer or carrier with every opportunity for control, but it also places the burden of making a choice upon the employer and carrier. <P>Thus, as we look to the fall legislative session, in which further reform has been promised in regard to the indemnity portion of workers' compensation, one is reminded of the wise caution, "Be careful of what you wish for." <P> Antonia L. Scarlata is chief executive officer of Options, a Pittsburgh firm that advises employers on issues related to disability management.

<h2>Eh Mate, Like Ma New Caw?</h2><P>
So your Lexus disappeared from the parking lot of your local shopping mall? Chances are it's on its way to Australia. Many foreign countries have relaxed standards as far as titles, vehicle identification numbers and shipping records are concerned. The result:  Luxury cars stolen in America are shipped and resold in foreign countries. <P> The National Insurance Crime Bureau says Lexus, Porsche and Mercedes are in demand in Australia and the Pacific Rim. Cadillac, BMW and Lincoln Towncar are the brands of choice in the Middle East. And you can thank capitalism for opening a market for Oldsmobile, Mercedes, Jaguar and Harley-Davidson in the former Soviet bloc countries. Federal agents, prodded by insurance carriers, are doing what they can to stem the tide. Last year, they intercepted 123 stolen vehicles with an estimated cumulative value of $3.8 million at the port of Los Angeles. <P> But many other vehicles slip through. One Chicago car dealer had two 1993 Nissan Pathfinders stolen from his lot on the same day. The vehicles turned up two months later in Central America (where sport utility vehicles are in demand), each with about 3,000 miles on the odometer. <P> High-priced cars are not the only ones being stolen. The top 10 automobiles reported stolen last year were: 
<OL>
<LI>Honda Accord <LI>Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme<LI>Ford Mustang <LI>Toyota Camry <LI>Oldsmobile Royale<LI>Honda Civic <LI>Chevrolet Camaro <LI>Cadillac Deville <LI>Chevrolet Caprice <LI>Toyota Corolla</OL> <P> One other note: Don't be surprised to find your car minus the airbag. The NICB says an increasing trend has crooked autobody shops paying thieves up to $200 to steal an airbag, which is then installed in another car at the price of about $1,500.<P>

<h2>Music to Their Ears</h2>When the curtain rises on the Pittsburgh Symphony's centennial season this month, audiences will get their first glimpse of the $6.5 million facelift that Heinz Hall has undergone especially for the event. <P>"These changes have been on the table for at least 10 years," says Gideon Toeplitz, managing director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. "When the Benedum opened in 1987, the other groups that had resided in Heinz Hall were no longer performing here. That gave us an opportunity to make this much more of a concert hall. It was designed in the late '60s to be a multi- purpose hall." <P> Toeplitz says that audiences will hardly see the changes. The changes included a completely new shell of six-inch thick wood, which surrounds the stage and projects sound. New risers for the orchestra were also constructed to allow the audience to better see and hear individual symphony members, and help them better hear each other, enhancing play. Small changes in the hall were made too -- the arches at the back of the hall were enclosed, lessening the space in the hall for the sound to travel and creating a buffer zone between the hall and the street. <P>"About three or four years ago, we invited five acoustical experts in. There was no disagreement on the problem, but we got five different solutions," says Toeplitz, who has been with the symphony for eight years. It was acoustical architect Larry Kirkegaard, of Downer's Grove, Ill., whose design was finally approved. "He had the most practical solution. He talked to everyone [symphony members, directors, audience] before he made recommendations. That's very wise. People feel part of the process."<P>

<h2>Build It and They Will Come</h2>So you want a baseball-only stadium in Pittsburgh? You can build one that will bear a strong resemblance to Forbes Field in your game room. It won't require a bond issue either, just $19.95. <P>Forbes Field -- Build-It-Yourself was created by Len Martin, president of Oakmont-based Point Four Ltd. The heavy-stock paper model is the second developed by Martin, who earlier marketed a paper model for Boston's venerable Fenway Park. <P>Assembly is required. The stadium actually is shipped in the form of a book, a full-color oversized paperback containing 215 pieces with easy-to-follow directions. Also included is a 28-page history of Forbes Field complete with 28 never-before-published color photographs. <P> Point Four Ltd., established in 1983, is an advertising agency that specializes in graphic design and technical illustration for industrial, engineering, architectural, transportation and high tech companies. <P>Forbes Field -- Build-It-Yourself is distributed by Publishers Distribution Service.  Order your own by calling (800) 345-0096 or fax (800) 950-9793.

<h2>Renaissance for the PRSA Awards</h2>None of the region's public relations firms won a single Renaissance Award this year. That's because there were no Renaissance Awards this year. <P>The Pittsburgh Chapter of the Public Relations Society of America is changing the timing and format of the annual awards, which honor the best PR campaigns. Instead of being held in the fall, the awards have been moved to spring and eventually will reflect work from the previous calendar year. This year's competition will include work done during both 1994 and 1995, with the awards themselves taking place March 28, 1996, at the Twentieth Century Club in Oakland. <P> Executive Report will continue as a sponsor and help pay tribute to two of the year's top communications professionals with the Renaissance Communicator of the Year and the CEO Communicator of the Year awards. <P><DL>
<LI>
 ER also will sponsor a PRSA professional development symposium that will be held in weekly sessions during October. Patterned after the renowned Harvard Business School case history symposiums, three professionals will describe projects they worked on related to the week's theme. A moderator from ER will lead a question and answer session at the end of each case history presentation. 
</DL>The four programs, each held at Point Park College on a Tuesday morning, will cover crisis communications,  Oct. 10, 7:30 a.m.; marketing communications, Oct. 17, 7:30 a.m.; corporate communications, Oct. 24, 7:30 a.m., and new horizons in the PR industry, Oct. 31, 7:30 a.m.<P>

<h2>Cellular Blues</h2>
Anyone who has ever talked on a cellular telephone in western Pennsylvania knows the routine: You drive into a valley, then that cracking noise starts. The voice on the other end says, "You are starting to break up." Click. <P>Western Pennsylvania is a cellular phone nightmare. <P>The Illinois Superconductor Corporation, with the help of AT&T, may answer the call. The companies are developing SpectrumMaster, the first major product line of radio frequency filters for cellular telephones. By replacing the thin-film superconductors with thick-film, high-temperature superconductors, ISCO has found ways to enhance two-way signal transmission for static-free calling as well as to expand call-carrying capacity of cellular systems. <P>More than 20 million Americans use cellular telephones, with an average of 9,500 new subscribers activating cellular telephones daily. <P>According to ISCO, researchers found improved receiver sensitivity and increased system capacity with minimal interference when the Illinois Superconductor technology was tested last year. SpectrumMaster filters have demonstrated interference rejection levels 100,000 times greater than the conventional filters currently in use in the wireless industry.<P>

<h2>Pitching Pennsylvania's Companies</h2>
It's showtime for the region's public companies. Emerald Asset Management and the HomeState Pennsyl-vania Growth Fund, with some help from ER, are sponsoring an investment forum Sept. 21 at the Westin William Penn.<p>
Public companies in Pennsylvania will have the opportunity to tell the region's investment professionals why they should be sinking money in the respective companies. <P>Emerald has held two comparable events in Philadelphia that were lauded by those who participated. <P> Up to 24 Pennsylvania companies will participate in the program, each alloted 30 minutes for a presentation, followed by another 30 minutes for breakout discussion. <P>"This will be a first-class event," says Emerald's David Buckingham. "It's a great opportunity for investment professionals to discover or learn more about some of the Pennsylvania companies that really are doing well."<P>
<HR>
<h2>To the Point: <BR>Global Competition</h2>"What might be good for Allegheny Ludlum, and for thousands of other companies throughout America, may not be so good for a growing segment of our society who live in increasing despair and increasing rage at what is perceived as the unfairness of it all. A society that cannot create the opportunity for meaningful work at meaningful wages for all who wish to work is a society at risk, regardless of its competitiveness." <P>
<B>-- Richard P. Simmons, chairman, Allegheny Ludlum Corp., in a speech at the Chautauqua Institution</B><BR>

<P align=center><B><font size = +1>Kaya Brings Caribbean to Pittsburgh</font><BR>
<I>By Lydia Strohl</I></B>
<P>
Until recently, a typical day in the Strip District began at 3 o'clock in the morning, when trucks rolled in with the day's fresh produce, and ended by 3 o'clock in the afternoon, when grocers shut their shops. But a fresh crop of nighttime hot spots is bringing new life to the area -- and Kaya is the freshest on the scene just now.
<p>
Kaya is a long, narrow, hip restaurant, anthropological in theme, stark yet warm, with primitive art and hieroglyphic graphics. Iron tables and railings contemporize the look; bar stools dressed like palm trees lighten it. Lilting music fills the air. 
<p>
The menu centers around tropas - small, appetizer-size dishes created with such delicacies as conch, quinoa, boniato and plantains - liberally sprinkled with peppers of all sorts - scotch bonnets, chipotle and poblano, to name a few. Never fear, a glossary is provided at the back of the menu. 
<P> 
The grilled pineapple quesadilla with black beans and chihuahua cheese was tart and savory, with melted cheese and a distinct cilantro flavor. The conch (giant sea snail, like the one you hear the sea in) fritters were a little bland, and without much conch, but a mango-tomatillo salsa spiced them up. The yuca (a root vegetable) fries were really nice, not too greasy and served with a chipotle alioli sauce that gently nipped us right back. The jerk chicken wings, refreshingly spicy, lie in a cooling bed of cilantro sauce. 
<P> 
The quinoa salad was also good -- a pile of mixed greens topped with peppers, quinoa (a nutty Incan grain) and scallions. Its lime cilantro vinaigrette was tasty, but abundant. The Kaya salad combines the same greens and dressing, but is simply garnished with pepitas, crisply toasted pumpkin seeds which are a work of art. 
<P> 
The tropas are definitely the most interesting and consistent items on the menu, which changed during the time we were researching the establishment. The paella, which varies daily, was a little dry, and without much meat or seafood. The mako shark brochettes were dry and unappealing, and didn't make it to the new roster. Owners Tom Barron and Juno Yoon say an initial, self-imposed dictum to keep menu items under $10 made it hard to achieve quality in items. The new menu upscales prices, but not dramatically. 
<P>
On the new menu, the sauteed shrimp with rum, ginger and coconut milk on a bed of yellow rice was piquant, flavorful, lifting the level of cooking up a notch from previous visits. The grilled pork calypso was first splashed with a guava BBQ sauce, then grilled crispy outside, tender inside, but not as exotic in taste as we expected. The mashed plantains needed spiced up with the Pickapeppa sauce every table boasts. (Try the relish, too.) I thought the greens a little bitter, but they seemed to vary by visit. 
<P>
Desserts here are wonderful, though the coffee was disappointingly terrible. Our favorite was a coconut chocolate brownie, baked with a hint of ginger, and topped with coconut ice cream handmade by Dave and Andy's. The guava cheesecake was perfectly textured, and not too sweet, on a cookie crust. The tart changes -- ours was key lime, tart indeed, balanced and light, with a moist graham cracker crust. A chocolate and banana bread pudding, substitute for the rice pudding on the menu, was too strongly flavored, and unevenly heated. 
<P>
If you'd like a beverage, you're in luck. There are 18 beers on tap, and 71 bottled microbrews and Belgian beers. There are also specialty drinks like the Lava Lover (coconut milk, coconut rum, pineapple juice and grenadine) and the Banana Reefna (creme de banana, light rum and pineapple juice). The wine list, though short, has been recently reengineered to compliment the food and shows real promise. 
<P>
The food here is still evolving, but the other elements of Kaya -- atmosphere, music, menu, drink, people and economical prices -- are there. Kaya is in, so the place pulls a crowd most nights of the week. All ages seem to enjoy it, but the complexion becomes younger, and the music louder, as the night wears on. Irie!

They call themselves Big Burrito Inc., but they might just as well answer to the Mad Mexican Magi, the Barons of Beer or the Emperors of Expansion. The two proprietors of Mad Mex, Kaya and a soon-to-be opened Mediterranean restaurant in Shady Side, are tops when it comes to creating cuisine, menus and environments that Pittsburghers find innovative and just plain fun. In October 1993 they opened the first Mad Mex in Oakland with $90,000 (can you say charge it?) and no chef --  on a wing and a fajita, so to speak. In contrast, their new restaurant, opening in October, is opening on the wing of a 747 -- at a cost of $500,000. It has it's own sommelier. What's next: the Concorde? Yep. They plan to give Mad Mex to the  world, in the form of international   franchises. Executive Report's Lydia Strohl talked to them at Kaya, their new Strip District restaurant. 
<P> 
<B>Executive Report: How did your partnership start? 
<P> 
Big Burrito: </B>We've been best friends since high school at the Bronx High School of Science in New York. <P> After college we went out to San Francisco and lived there for a few months. I [Juno] guess my mom was kind of pissed off that I wasn't in New York, so she bought a restaurant from a friend of hers, a coffee shop on Third Avenue. She called me and said she needed someone to run it. That was in 1987. 
<P>
<B>ER: Why did she think you could run it? 
<P> 
BB:</B> I don't think she had a clue. Someone had to run it. After being there a few months we realized we were up against a wall. Undercapitalized, rent ridiculously high, bad setup, equipment all failing and the location was not ideal. It was a commercial area, with no nighttime business. It wasn't like we weren't busy, we were packed for lunch. But with that rent, we just couldn't cover our costs. 
<P> 
<B>ER: So what brought you to Pittsburgh? 
<P>
BB: </B>My [Tom] sister got engaged to a man from Pittsburgh. I went out to visit and got involved in a business venture called "Wheel Deliver," in 1989. I did that for several years, then I saw the opportunity to get a space, and wanted to do a Mexican restaurant because no one was doing anything cool or fun. I called up Juno to see if he wanted to get it started, correctly this time. He came, checked out the scene, agreed with me and we started Mad Mex, on our credit cards and some borrowed money, as cheaply as we could. 
<P>
<B>ER: What was the capital investment in Mad Mex?
<P> 
BB: </B>About $90,000. We did a lot of work ourselves, sweat equity. Everything we started with broke, so we more than doubled our investment the first year. We were lucky, we had positive cash flow from the beginning. We sunk all the money back into the business. 
<P>
<B>ER: Mad Mex took off fast -- was it just that there was a hole in the  market? 
<P> 
BB: </B>Absolutely. Coming from New York and California, where there's a Mexican restaurant on almost every block, and seeing Chi-Chi's voted best Mexican restaurant here kind of tells you something. From the start though, we wanted to expand it. It was meant to be a prototype, a model of things to come, so we did unique menus, unique beer lists, ambiance. We had a unique theme by combining California Mexican food, relatively healthy Mexican food, with strictly micro-brewed and Belgian beers. 
<P>
<B>ER: The types of beer available when you started the restaurant, though, were relatively limited, and Pennsylvania's alcohol laws restrictive. How did you manage to make this part of your concept work? 
<P>
BB: </B>Everyone told us that you couldn't do that here, but we ignored it. I [Juno) called up people from Brooklyn and Sierra Nevada -- it first came in through Allentown, because you can't bring it in from out of state, but you can ship it from one part of the state to another. Since we've developed the market, the beer distributors here all sell it. We were the first to have microbrewed beers. 
<P> 
The beer companies have to be registered with the state. It's not a big deal, they just have to pay taxes. We started out with 35 to 40 brews, and now we're up to 95 to 100. In Oakland, we only had six drafts put in; since then, in the North Hills, we put in 20 drafts, and here at Kaya we have 18. And there are still a lot of microbrews out there we can't get, because they're not registered with the state. 
<P>
<B>ER: When did you open Mad Mex in the North Hills? 
<P>
BB: </B>November 3, 1994, one year afterwards. Then Kaya opened April 6, this spring. From day one, it's just been incredible. All our restaurants really, from the beginning, have taken off. It seems there is definitely a void we're filling. 
<P>
<B>ER: From where did the concept for Kaya come? 
<P>
BB: </B>We were originally going to do a tropical restaurant, kind of a "hot spot" of the world, then we narrowed it down to the Caribbean. We liked the idea of tapas, which is a Spanish dish, you know, the small, little entrees. So our chef created tropas, which are tropical tapas, and we combined that with our entrees. We brought in a chef from D.C. and sent him to Florida, where there are a lot of restaurants that serve this food, and he came up with the menu. About 50 percent of our menu is vegetarian, and they are unique flavors -- no one else is doing it. Which makes it difficult actually, because there was just not that much available. We're the only purchasers of a bunch of the stuff that we buy. The prices have come down somewhat since we've been creating a market, too. But it was very difficult -- things that cost a dime in Florida cost a dollar here. 
<P>
Our menu's very reasonable, but you'd be surprised how many people think the prices are high, because it's Pittsburgh. They don't realize that if you were in any other metropolitan area it would be twice the price. We started out trying to keep everything under $10, but now we're planning to upscale a few of the items: We tried to do a paella inexpensively, but realized you just can't do the paella people want inexpensively. 
<P>
I [Juno] think there was a market for this kind of food, because we do get a lot of regulars. But we are educating people, too. We're doing great numbers and it's odd, because the Strip traditionally has been dead on a Sunday, Monday or Tuesday night, even Wednesday, except for Metropol. But we get a crowd every night. So we're definitely bringing people to the area. 
<P> 
We're also bringing a new look to a restaurant. There aren't too many restaurants in town that devote as much to the design features that are here. We care about the details. The people who do our graphics [Wall-to-Wall] do a great job. We work with an architect, Riva Sloane, out of New York City, who went to high school with us. She's designed all three restaurants. 
<P>
We haven't done a lot of advertising for Kaya, it's mostly been word of mouth. We've been doing a lot of other things though. Consistency is always a problem the first couple months. We're trying to see what we should do with the menu, we'd like to expand it. People come in here and they've tried everything we have. We've instituted a lunch menu with a lot lower prices, a lot more sandwiches. Dinner will be expanded, and I don't think we'll have a problem selling specials for $10 to $14, as long as it's great food and a great value. 
<P>
<B>ER:  And your next venture? 
<P> 
BB: </B>Mediterranean food and wines, 226 South Highland, Shadyside. We'll have about 20 bottles of wine available by the glass, it will be a wine bar. A gentleman named Brian Bennett will be our general manager; he worked at Gateway Wine, and spent time working for the wineries in Sonoma and Napa counties, he's incredibly knowledgeable.  It will be opening up sometime in mid-October. We're totally redoing the whole thing. 
<P> 
<B>ER: How has your investment in starting a restaurant increased? How much are you putting in this one? 
<P>
BB: </B>Too much. Our budget for this one is $5 million. Kaya was in that price range as well. The next one's bigger, though. It seats about 75 people, then there's an outdoor cafe that holds about 45 people. Then a downstairs that will be an upscale bar, a lounge. It will be a separate look, it won't be a heavy eating establishment. 
<P>
<B>ER: Will you present live music, as at Mad Mex in the North Hills? 
<P> 
BB: </B>No, we'll probably just get the best stereo system we can. Actually, we just stopped the bands there -- we were getting the crowds, but they weren't spending any money. It wasn't the right kind of crowd. If we find a space that's appropriate in this part of town I think we'll do it -- the North Hills just isn't as progressive or artsy. 
<P>
<B>ER: How are you two adjusting to living in Pittsburgh?
<P>
Tom:</B> Me? I have a family. I'm doing the things you're supposed to do in Pittsburgh. It takes a few years. 
<P>
<B>Juno: </B>I guess I'm still doing the things I would do in New York. Just being wild and a little irresponsible sometimes. But I'm adjusting. I actually think this city has a lot of potential. At the beginning I was somewhat homesick, but I'm a lot more comfortable. I guess I need to do the Pittsburgh thing, find a wife, then maybe I'll slow down. 
<P>
<B>Tom:</B> Somebody has to be wild, to give us the concepts. We have to stay in touch, because that's a market. It's a relatively old town, population wise, but we're actually doing stuff for a younger crowd. But it's really all over the board. People seem to know when to come. The later it gets, the younger it gets. There's a dinner hour, then later at night, we play the music a little louder, and it gets a little more funky. 
<P> 
<B>ER: In a town like this, where such a strong chain restaurant mentality exists, is it a drawback to name this restaurant [Kaya] different from Mad Mex? 
<P>
BB:</B> People know our reputation, probably more so in the East End. But we're going to get a crowd as soon as we open up something new. People realize we are doing something new. We just have to give them a good product when they walk in the door. 
<P> 
After this Mediterranean restaurant, and a couple of little projects, we're concentrating a lot on expanding Mad Mex. We're going to be starting to franchise Mad Mex this summer. We want eventually to be international with Mad Mex. It has an easy formula for replicating itself. I think we'll be outside the Pittsburgh area by next year, Philadelphia, Columbus maybe, going out in concentric circles, staying away from the major cities. 
<P>
<B>ER: How would you rate the employee pool in Pittsburgh? 
<P>
BB:</B> The good thing about Kaya is that we've attracted educated, quality kitchen people. They weren't as attracted to Mad Mex by itself, until they saw we were doing other things.
<P>
At the front of the house, it's definitely dismal compared to other towns. The restaurants that we are trying to create just aren't here. It's a high energy. The restaurants here, some have really good food, but that's pretty much what they've concentrated on. There's much more beyond that. 
<P>
<B>ER: How do you guys split up responsibilities? 
<P>
BB:</B> Good question. We're still working on that. I [Juno] try to take the daily operation and I do all the beer, that's a big job. Tom is basically in the office.  As we grow, we're bringing in a lot of highly qualified people to help us. That's why we're trying to grow so fast, to attract high quality people that we really like. The key's always to hire people that have more knowledge than we do, and can do the job better than us. There are a lot of people out there that fulfill that requirement. People that take their position so seriously that they get everything right. It seems like we're making less mistakes with each restaurant we open up. It's actually getting easier. Getting money together to open a restaurant is the most difficult. 
<P>
<B>ER: How have you raised the capital to start these other ventures? 
<P>
BB:</B> We have two investors from Indiana, Pa., that we brought in after the first restaurant. We're trying to grow with the same group of people, and make the money we have now go as far as it can. Our investors aren't Bank of New York or anything like that, but they're taking us to the level we want to be. Similar to us, they've been in business together a long time. 
<P>
<B>ER: Besides money, what else is essential to make a restaurant opening smooth? 
<P>
BB:</B> That you really need a chef when you open a restaurant. We didn't have a chef when we opened Mad Mex, the second one we had a somewhat experienced chef, and here [Kaya] we have real chefs. Also the front of the house -- it's very young. The next one we are going to have a more experienced group both waiting tables, and managing. We have a good, dedicated group of employees, but the next restaurant is going to be a little more sophisticated, we're charging a little more for our food, and we have to do a really high quality job. We're really covering three different areas, Mad Mex is a low ticket item, this one is the next level up and the next one is going to be just one level above it. We really want to show people that we can handle it. 
<P>
The most famous story is opening night, Mad Mex, Day One. We didn't get our health certificate until the day we opened, we didn't have any practice runs, we just needed the money. We opened, nobody had any experience, our chef wasn't there, both people in the kitchen were crying by the end of the night..we ran out of food by 9:30 and had to close down. Everybody came. We had these ads, and people were waiting for us to open. It was nuts from day one. 
<P>
<B>ER: What's the most rewarding aspect of it all? 
<P>
BB:</B> Being successful. So many people come in here and say `You're finally doing what this town needs.' We've really opened up some eyes. The trick for us as we grow is to become a non-chain chain. We never want to lose the feeling of the first restaurant.<P>

<B><P align=center>Cigars Are Cool, and the Demand is Throwing the Industry Into a Tizzy</B><BR>
<B><I>By Lydia Strohl</B></I>
<P>
One summer Friday in July, Bonnie Smola, a unit manager in the derivative settlement area at Mellon Bank, took a long lunch. Having taken advantage of dress down day (a Mellon tradition) to wear jeans tucked into black leather boots, she headed her gleaming silver and black Harley-Davidson motorcycle for Bloom Cigars, on 12th Street in the South Side of Pittsburgh. 
<P> 
Inside, she finds Dr. Richard Gehl, an orthopedic doctor between rounds, leaning back in an old rolling desk chair, smoking an Avo Uvezian, and clad in his white lab coat. She settles in next to Rick Sensky, a truck driver with tattooed serpents ringing his arms. They all puff companionably, joking with shop owner Marc Adams. Customers continually pass through the shop's two small rooms, which are filled with the amber and green  second-hand furniture reminiscent of  a fraternity living room. The air is ripe with pungent cigar smoke, the walls lined with curling pictures of  customers, men (and the occasional woman) sporting stogies. The group ebbs and flows, changing faces, cigars the only constant. 
<P>
Decadent? Disgusting? Not to dedicated premium cigar smokers around the country -- whose numbers are growing up in smoke. In the past two years, demand for premium, hand-rolled cigars has increased roughly 50 percent, according to Cigar Aficionado magazine. About 2,000 cigar smokers belong to Bloom's self-styled cigar camp, officially in session Saturdays from noon to 8 p.m. Activities include conviviality, coffee and bagels, and, of course, cigars. Due in part to the 400 to 800 "campers" who pass through on an average Saturday, Adams reports a 300 percent increase in business over the past three years. That's high, but not too unusual; other retailers have reported annual increases of 50 percent in the same period. <P>Before that, business was crawling. Though prevalent at the turn of the century, from the 1920s on cigars gave way to the more convenient cigarette and were increasingly associated with overweight mobsters sporting shiny shoes. The Surgeon General's report on smoking, released in 1964, let more air out of the market -- and by the '80s, cigars had become a white hot no-no in a world increasingly spattered with "no smoking" signs. <P>And it didn't get any better -- in 1981, 101 million premium cigars were imported, according to federal statistics. By 1992, that number had slipped to 99 million. "It was a struggle," says Adams, who took over Bloom's, a family business, in 1987. 
<P> 
"The premium hand-rolled cigar market had largely stabilized in the early '80s, and the given psychology of the market was one that was happy to have their little niche and sell cigars. It was an industry that was content if a year was flat," says Gordon Mott, editor of Cigar Aficionado, which many credit with the rebound of the premium cigar market. In 1992, Marvin Shanken, publisher of the Wine Spectator, convinced some of his advertisers to put their considerable force behind his new venture, Cigar Aficionado. Suddenly, cigars were chic, associated with fast cars, beautiful men and women, $400 watches and the good life. 
<P>
"By the end of 1992, retailers were already beginning to report an upsurge in sales," Mott recalled from his New York office. "They were seeing new faces, often with the magazine in hand." While talking, he performed one of the more arduous tasks of his position, taste-testing a cigar identifiable only as "number 39." 
<P>
It is these new faces that are key to the upsurge in demand. Prior to 1992, says Mott, the average age of a cigar smoker was 45 to 65-plus. Some attribute the market increase to the large pool of baby boomers reaching an age where they appreciate a fine cigar. But Mott says magazine trade shows, known as "Big Smokes," attract a younger crowd. Not just men, but women. Adams, too, has noticed a change in his customer demographic.
<p>
"It's status, a symbol of success that we all in some way aspire to," says Adams. "Lighting up a cigar is like putting a $20 bill in your mouth and lighting it with a match." 
<P>
True, the pages of Cigar Aficionado reflect a high class demographic. But cigar smokers defy stratification, as absolutely as cigar smoking defies society's bans. Let's face it, cigar smoking is subtle rebellion, so politically incorrect it's become cool. 
<P>
Just north of Pittsburgh, friends gather each summer weekend to get out of the city. These men look nothing like the smooth, drop-dead gorgeous men gracing the pages of Cigar Aficionado  -- they probably don't own blow driers. They're fathers, sensitive men who read and bring home flowers. They eat out, sail and recycle -- hitting all the '90s stereotypes dead on. And when they get together, more likely for a Budweiser than for a glass of cognac, they kick back and light up cigars. 
<p>
Whether they are tolerated inside, and mingle, or are booted out to smoke in a huddle, their confident attitude is an intangible cord that binds them, like seventh graders sharing a secret. 
<P>
"It's the camaraderie," says Smola, 30, the Harley-Davidson-riding Mellon banker, now surveying Bloom's walk-in humidor. Shelves line the walls of the room, stocked with hundreds of thousands of cigars like an adult candy store. "It doesn't matter who you are --there are lawyers, doctors, jitney drivers -- nobody's different, because there is this communal bond. We get into very interesting conversations because of the diverse backgrounds." 
<P>
The society is a big part of it. Across the country, the popularity (and the pockets) of cigar smokers have cajoled formerly forbidding restaurants to open their doors for cigar dinners and other events. Cigar clubs, most much posher than Bloom's, are also on the rise. The LeMont Cigar and Spirit Society was formed in June, and charges a membership fee of $200 per year. The club has six dinners each year at the Mt. Washington restaurant, for which members pay $125, and non-members $160. The Rivers Club has just formed the Golden Leaf Society, with a $250 or $50 initiation, and an annual fee of $50 in addition to the Rivers Club regular membership fees. Seventy smokers attended their first meeting in April. 
<P>
The demand produced by this incredible growth has the cigar industry reeling. From cigar manufacturers on down to the South Side shop, business is affected: A part of that 50 percent increase in demand reported by Cigar Aficionado is an estimated 20 to 25 million cigar backorder. 
<P>
"We have millions of dollars on backorder. But the biggest volume is in the mass market [machine-made cigars] -- the high-grade market is $100 million to $200 million, tiny   compared to the $2.3 billion whole," says Sherwin Seltzer, vice president      of marketing and sales for Villazon, which manufactures Hoyo de Monterey and Punch, among others. Villazon has two plants in Honduras, with 1,000 employees, and a plant in Tampa which manufactures machine-made cigars and employs 400. "There are basically five companies that manufacture high grade cigars, and they are all having the same problems."
<p>
But they all, he adds, have increased sales by 20 to 30 percent over the last three years. 
<P>
So what's the problem? Tobacco for premium cigars, which Villazon gets from the Caribbean, Honduras, the Dominican Republic and Con-necticut, must age two years. Companies order based on future projections -- and three years ago, no one had a clue the demand would increase like this. Add to that a work force of highly trained artisans, many of whom apprentice for years to hand-roll cigars, and the reasons for the bottleneck become clear. Results of the excessive demand are reflected in price increases: according to Seltzer, Villazon has instituted two 5- to 7-percent increases so far this year because tobacco, previously $30 to 40 per pound, has increased $10. vBut even that hasn't slowed demand. 
<P>
"Every cigar maker is selling everything he makes," says Mott. "And how tough can that be? But in some ways it compromises quality because they've used tobacco before it's ready just to turn them out. It will be 1996 or 1997 before the decision to increase production begins to alleviate the shortfall." 
<P>
Will the cigar's popularity last that long? I recounted this tale to my father, a businessman manipulated by his own health into swearing off cigars. "Seven years," he said, shaking his head sagely. <P>"Until they peak?" I asked. I had been hoping for his forecast. 
<P>
"No," he said, "Until I retire. Then I can smoke them." 
<P> 
Looks like the market's in fine shape for a good while yet.

<H2>Amid Talk Of Sale, Black Box Still Looking Strong</H2>


Is Black Box Corp. destined to be sold? Neither the company nor Odyssey Partners are doing much talking, but events in July seem to indicate Black Box is on the block. <P> Black Box stock jumped over three points, then gave back much of the gain. This occurred over the summer as Odyssey, the New York-based leveraged buyout firm that controls Black Box, withdrew a secondary offering of half its stake in Black Box, then reoffered the stock. <P> Black Box just reported record first quarter results in marking the 11th consecutive quarter of double-digit revenue growth since going public. Black Box is experiencing relatively strong growth in the U.S. following management-led initiatives to revive  its domestic operations. Most impressively, average gross margins are around 54 percent. <P>The list of potential buyers for Black Box is long, for good reason. Black Box possesses an extremely attractive franchise, both in the United States and internationally. Its catalog is famous among information systems managers, and the company may prove to be resistant to an economic downturn. <P>Besides Odyssey, which has already made a bundle on Black Box, the company's two top officers also stand to make millions if it is sold. Jeffery M. Boetticher, president and CEO, and Frederick C. Young, its chief financial officer, have lucrative change of control agreements in their contracts. The agreement would pay each man three times the average of their annual total compensation for the prior two years. Additionally, both men would see all their options vest immediately. <P> 

<H2>Around the ER Index</h2> 
The ER Index continues to outperform the S&P 500 for the second consecutive month, posting a gain of 8.4 percent vs. the S&P 500's 5.39 percent gain, for the four weeks ended July 7. Since its inception, the 25-stock ER Index has climbed 21.8 percent compared with the S&P's 20.6 percent, with eight stocks posting gains of 15 percent or greater and only two stocks reporting modestly negative returns. 
<UL>
<LI> While technology stocks are still popular, cyclicals seem to be coming back in favor in recent months. Alcoa posted a      25 percent gain in the month as       the company continues to reap the benefits of higher prices  for beverage can, sheet and fabricated aluminum products. Alcoa reported an in-crease in second quarter net income of 383 percent to $219.4 million or $1.23 per share vs. $45.4 million or 25 cents per share, exceeding Wall Street's expectations of $1.17 per share.
<LI>Kennametal shares jumped 23 percent in the month to 30 7/8 as analysts began to raise expectations about the strength of the company's markets. Kennametal is the leading carbide cutting tool maker in the U.S., with a 35 percent market share. 
<LI>Although the cyclicals led the index this month, it's difficult to overlook II-VI Inc. Pronounced "two-six," II-VI is a new addition to the ER Index this month, replacing Legent Corp., which was acquired by Computer Associates. Saxonburg-based II-VI designs, manufactures and markets optical and electro-optical components for infrared devices used in high power industrial lasers and military sensing systems. Since adding II-VI to the index last month, it has appreciated 15.6 percent. Since August 15 of last year, the company has appreciated a whopping 573 percent, rocketing from 4 1/8 on Aug. 15, 1994 to 27 1/4 on July 7, 1995. 
<LI>Thomas H. Lee Co., General Nutrition Co.'s largest institutional investor announced plans to sell approximately 10 million shares in a public offering which equates to more that half of Lee's stake in the company. Since May 26, officers and people connected with GNC also have filed to sell 246,500 shares. Edwin Kozlowski, General Nutrition's chief financial officer, declined to comment on the selling when asked by Bloomberg Business News. On July 7, GNC stated that it expects earnings for the second quarter ended July 22 to exceed analysts' expectations of 32 cents due to stronger than anticipated sales. GNC stock continues to perform extremely well, rising 14.7 percent in the month to 38 1/8. <P>

<P align=center><FONT SIZE=+2><B>With GOP in Control, Business Must Get All It Can Right Now</B></FONT><BR>

<B><I>By Lydia Strohl</I></B>
<P>
Business leaders say the pro-business actions of the Republican-controlled statehouse are a step toward accomplishing reforms long sought but long unfulfilled. 
<P> 
Now, the state's business leaders want to keep that momentum rolling when lawmakers return to the Capitol this month. The legislators will be met with a wish list from business interests who are eager to continue the work begun in the first six months of Gov. Tom Ridge's administration. 
<P> 
The inauguration of the Republican Ridge in January -- teamed with a GOP majority in the House and Senate and a Republican Congress in Washington -- set in motion a number of changes Pennsylvania business has sought for years. Tax breaks led the list of improvements, totaling more than $200 million and energized by an accelerated cut in the much-bemoaned corporate net income tax. 
<P> 
A new outlook for state agencies, heralded by the governor as "user-friendly," is becoming a hallmark of his administration. From a business standpoint, the Department of Environmental Resources went from whipping boy to poster child, showing off Ridge's determination to make changes in structure and attitude. The department was split in July, separating the operations of parks and forests from a new environmental enforcement agency with a mission to help businesses comply with regulations, rather than seek out violators from the start. 
<P>
The General Assembly also passed a package of bills setting new standards for the cleanup and reuse of abandoned, polluted industrial sites across the state. 
<P>
"It's a good first start," says Fred Sembach, vice president for government affairs at the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry. 
<P>
"Our members mention three areas: taxes, regulatory reform and workplace issues," Sembach says. "In the first six months, we've seen action on each of those." 
<P>
Further reform of environmental policy is on the wish list of the chamber, which represents the interests of 4,400 Pennsylvania companies, from Fortune 500 to small business. The chamber's Business Agenda for Change highlights the environment, seeking improved efficiency in the regulatory process, including consistency between state and federal rules and quicker response from state regulators. 
<P>
The chamber also would like to see the state government continue to reduce business taxes, reform workers' compensation policies, work for cost containment in healthcare matters and simplify financing programs for capital expansion. 
<P>
Sembach says he anticipates workers' compensation being the big issue before lawmakers this fall, and Ridge has promised to push from his end. Because the state's current system is 100 percent employer financed, Sembach says, businesses want to reduce those costs. But any changes that come will be hard-won because other constituencies -- from labor to physicians to insurance carriers -- have their own interests to protect. 
<P> 
Another dominant group, the Pennsylvania Manufacturers Associa-tion, portrays Ridge's first budget as one with a meaning running much deeper than just dollars and cents. 
<P>
"Combining the tax breaks with a restrained 2 percent increase in public spending can't help but spur economic growth," PMA Chairman Frederick W. Anton III says. 
<P>
 Like others, the PMA endorsed Ridge's budget as a positive step, at the same time emphasizing that work remains to be done before Pennsylv-ania is on even footing with other states. "We're confident we can work with Gov. Ridge to win additional business reforms," Anton says. 
<P> 
Most importantly, business groups know the time for more reform is now. 
<P>
A governor sympathetic to the interests of business, working with a General Assembly dominated by his own party and falling in line with many of his views, is a dream combination. 
<P> 
But just as quickly as the GOP came into power, that power could be lost and with it the one-two punch of legislative and executive branch both backing business. The state House is in Republican hands by a margin of one member, who crossed party lines after the 1994 election. The edge has held despite rumblings of defections to the Democratic side and -- barring any such switches -- will give Republicans the chance to continue to run things from the statehouse. 
<P>
At least until next year's election.<p>

<P align=center><B><font size = +2>Community Hospitals are Affiliating With large Health Systems, Without Hurting Their Community Status</font><BR>
<I>By Lydia Strohl</I></B>
<P>

Aliquippa resident Ruth Wieting doesn't know much about the ensuing alliance between Aliquippa Hospital and St. Francis Health System. But she thinks it will be a good thing. 
<P> 
"I read a brief news article in the paper, but other than that, I don't have much of an idea," says Wieting, who works for Celebration, a nonprofit business organization. "It's not a merger. My understanding is that services that are not available will be made available through linkages between the two hospitals. It will expand clientele for St. Francis, so it's not just one giving to another."
<p>
The two have, in fact, just finished "courting," according to Charles Lonchar, CEO of Aliquippa Hospital. 
<P> 
"Basically, we took a year to look each other over to see whether it's beneficial for us," says Lonchar. "Now we're in the process of working through the legal documents." 
<P>
Regionally, more and more community hospitals are joining large health systems to ensure their future in an increasingly competitive arena. The news is threatening in some communities, where residents fear the loss of services that for years have been available right down the street. And so opinions like Wieting's are crucial -- for if the community hospitals engender a backlash in the community, they risk losing their greatest asset. To garner community blessing, say experts, communications is the key. v"We recognized two or three years ago that the wave of the future is affiliation with tertiary hospitals," says Gino Piroli, former chairman of Aliquippa Hospital's board of directors. "It gives us more strength and more resources. Insurers will be making decisions in the future -- they might not pick up an Aliquippa Hospital because it's not that large. But if it's part of a 1,000-bed system, rather than just 100 beds, they'll deal with you."
<p>
Among the benefits Piroli cites are expanded physician recruitment and financial strength for projects like reopening their cardiac catheterization lab and building an obstetrics ward. Piroli says that because services like this were absent, and physicians were not present in the community to refer patients to Aliquippa Hospital, the hospital had increasingly lost patients to others, including nearby Sewickley Hospital.  The alliance with St. Francis is a logical step. 

<P>
"We had good community support in this," says Piroli. "We had a welcome luncheon for St. Francis about six months ago, and all the community leaders came, county leaders, the state legislature came and gave their support -- there's no question the community wants to see us stay open and became stronger." 
<P>
Piroli says the goodwill and support was perpetuated by the board of directors. The community was informed of the decision to affiliate after it had been made, via personal contact and news media. 
<P>
"We're a close-knit community, and a close board, and we all had contacts with different people," says Piroli. <P>Other hospitals have had to go further to ensure community support, however. As soon as the South Side Hospital began to look for an affiliate, they met with community groups to get input. By not only keeping the community abreast of the situation, but involving them in the process, the hospital garnered support for their even- tual affiliation with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. 
<P>
"It was a two-year process, geared towards strengthening the community and being able to provide the resources that the community needs," says South Side CEO George J. Korbakes. "Many were concerned that with the merger, the activities that occur here might change. It was an uncertainty of the unknown." 
<P>
Korbakes says that the hospital's board, medical staff, and other employees were given continual updates via an internal newsletter. Meetings were regularly scheduled. But much of the communications was informal, as well. 
<P>
"A lot of our employees live in the service area, and so we always communicated through them," says Korbakes. "There was a lot of just walking down the hall and answering questions." 
<P>
These issues will continue to come up, as more and more affiliations are made in this market. 
<P>
"I believe there will only be three or four networks that emerge in the region," says Sister M. Rosita Wellinger, CEO of St. Francis Medical Center. "Allegheny General Hospital and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center have announced they will form networks. St. Francis will be the third network." 
<P>
These are not new issues for communities, either. Twenty years ago, Jefferson Hospital was formed by the consolidation of Homestead Com-munity Hospital and St. Joseph's Hospital in the South Side. 
<P>
"The major consideration was the people in the community," says  William R. Jennings, Jefferson's CEO. "But both, in the long run, felt that without the merger they would not be able to compete. I think the thing is to be careful going in." 
<P>
Because no matter how big the networks get, Jennings says, "health care will always be delivered locally."

<HR>  

<P align=center><B><font size = +2>All You Need Are Clubs And a Car</font><BR>
<I>By Joe Tuscano</I></B>
<P>

You're walking off the 18th green at your favorite golf course, and suddenly you notice that your hands are sweaty and it's hard to catch your breath. 
<P> 
There is a weakness in your legs and the joints are beginning to stiffen. You look around, wondering if anyone is noticing the sweat that is trickling down your forehead or the way your upper lip is twitching. 
<P> 
There's no need for a doctor because you already know what gives you this tormenting feeling. It's not a virus, the flu or gout. 
<P>
It's the end-of-the-season golfing blues. 
<P>
Each year at this time, your golf ball is harder to find because of the leaves falling from fairway trees. The wind has a peculiar chill to it, not like the warm, sultry breezes of July that seem to make that new Titleist travel farther off the tee. Fall is approaching and that means the golf season is nearing an end. 
<P>
For many of those who love the game, winter is as cruel for its rough weather as it is for keeping golfers off the course until March. You've tried that winter golf thing, and found it to be frustrating and costly because of all the balls you sent into snowbanks. 
<P>
What you really want right now is one final shot, one memorable weekend that includes all the pampering a golf getaway can offer: good food, great golf, spa facilities, great golf, comfortable accommodations, great golf and - most important - great golf. 
<P>
Where do you turn? That's simple, because this region is packed with resorts that offer some intriguing and lavish golf adventures that can make a weekend stretch into a week, and a 36-hole day a most enjoyable experience. 
<P>
The following is a sampling of golf resorts available for that quick getaway or a vacation spot for that special foursome for next summer. 
<P>
<H2>Seven Springs </H2>
Nestled in the Allegheny Mountains, Seven Springs offers a number of golf packages for its challenging course, a 6,360-yard, par 71. 
<P>
"We have a number of packages, with the instructional ones being the most popular," says Seven Springs spokeswoman Marcy Rigby. "The brochure says the packages ended in August but if you call the resort, they will accommodate you." 
<P>
The Instructional Golf Vacation is a three-day, two-night stay that costs $439 per person per double occupancy. The charge is $600 per person for single occupancy but a roommate may be provided if available.
<p>
The package includes breakfast on both mornings, three lunches, five hours of instruction, club storage and cleaning, and use of the driving range. <P>Each golfer receives a sleeve of golf balls, a bag tag, towel, hat and golf shirt. A video tape analysis of your performance can detect any flaws. <P>As for the course, those who have played it walk away impressed. 
<P>
"There are some relatively short par threes, but they are still challenging holes," says Rick Rohac, an avid golfer who is president of Business America Pittsburgh Metro East, a business appraisal/valuation firm. 
<P>
"I thought, aesthetically, it was one of the nicer courses in the area," says Mike Bishop, vice president of Heritage Trust Co., an asset management firm in Greentree. 
<P> 
Seven Springs offers many other attractions, including fine dining, horseback riding, mountain biking, volleyball, tennis, hiking and the famous Alpine Slide ride. 
<P>
<H2>Nemacolin Woodlands </H2>
Nemacolin Woodlands opened  a Pete Dye-designed championship course, Mystic Rock. The majestic, 6,900-yard course is as demanding as you'll find in western Pennsylvania. The course is in addition to Nemacolin's popular Links Course. 
<P>
The resort offers a number of golf getaway packages for both courses. 
<P>
"Many golfers play the Links one day and upgrade [their package] to Mystic Rock the next," says Dan Swiegert, director of sales and marketing at Nemacolin Woodlands. "We have a lot of group packages. We also have reunion groups, where guys come out for the weekend to play."
<P>
Some golfers hope the Links Course does not lose its appeal as Mystic Rock draws the crowds. 
<P> 
"The Links Course is a good course in the sense that you use all your clubs," says Luigi DiIanni, an environmental engineer at USX. "You use your driver, followed by a variety of clubs. You have a wide range of shots." 
<P> 
Nemacolin Woodlands offers two basic types of packages, one which in-cludes use of the resort's condominiums and one that includes a stay at the Inn. 
<P>
The Inn package requires a two-night minimum stay and includes dinner, breakfast, overnight accommodations, unlimited greens fees, shared cart rental, club storage, a sleeve of golf balls, daily clinics and daily access to the spa areas and spa facilities. The package's weekend rate is $207 per person based on double occupancy and $305 per person, single occupancy. The weekday rates run $199 and $282. 
<P>
The condominium package in-cludes golf on the Links Course as well as all of the Inn package, except dinner. <P>"Most take the condo package because they can do their own cooking," Swiegert says. 
<P>
Nemacolin Woodlands offers the condo package at a quad price (two couples) of $112 per person. Each condo has two bedrooms and 2 1/2 baths. 
<P> 
<H2>Oglebay Park </H2>
Located in the northern panhandle of West Virginia, Oglebay Park offers golfers the option of playing three different courses.
<P>
Speidel Championship Golf Course is the jewel of the park's golf package. Designed by Robert Trent Jones, the course runs 7,000 yards over hilly terrain and was home to the West Virginia LPGA Classic for 11 years. 
<P>
Crispin Golf Course runs 5,670 yards and, because of its central location, offers a near complete view of the park. Oglebay also has a par-three course and driving range, both lighted for night use.
<P>
For $79 per person per night, a golfer can play 36 holes, 18 holes each on Speidel and Crispin, and have unlimited access to the par-three course. Accommodations at Wilson Lodge are based on double occupancy while a minimum of four individuals are required for a stay in one of the park's rustic cabins. 
<P>
Golf carts aren't included in the rates but may be rented for $24 per round. 
<P>
Oglebay Park offers a number of other attractions for the family, including fine dining, swimming, a zoo, a nature center, hiking and jogging trails, fitness center, museum, glass works, and garden center. 
<H2>Cross Creek Resort </H2>
While famous for oil, Titusville also offers one of the finest golf resorts in western Pennsylvania. 
<P>
Cross Creek combines the beauty of its forests with the challenging contours of its 27-hole championship course. The North Course is a par-70, 6,495-yard layout, while the South Course is par-36 and 3,238 yards. 
<P>
Paved cart paths wind around the course, ponds and streams. The resort's getaway packages offer something for each golfer. 
<P>
"Everything is on site here," says Cross Creek spokeswoman Tracy Hasbrouck. "We have 94 motel rooms surrounded by the 27-hole course. Along with that are the main building with the restaurant, pro shop, lounge, gift shop and several meeting and convention rooms. 
<P>
"Our packages are a great deal and are all inclusive with unlimited golf, a cart, dinners, breakfasts and overnight accommodations." 
<P>

Cross Creek's three-day, two-night package offers all that for $229 during the weekdays (Sunday through Thurs-day), $249 for offseason weekends (April 1 through May 6 and Sept. 14 through Oct. 14), and $269 for in-season weekends (May 11 through Sept. 9). 
<P> 
A four-day, three-night stay runs $319 for weekdays, $349 for offseason weekends and $369 for in-season weekends. Three- and four-day stays include dinners, breakfasts and cart rentals. Prices are based on a per-person, double occupancy stay. 
<P>
The resort has a two-day, one-night offer for $159 on weekdays only. <P>Cross Creek offers packages without golf for individuals who wish to take advantage of the area's outstanding tourist attractions. They include the Drake Well, the first oil well in the country, the OC&T Railroad, museums and the Dandy's Frontier Park. 
<P>
<H2>Hidden Valley Resort </H2>
It started 40 years ago as a small, family-run restaurant and inn and blossomed into one of the more popular resorts in Pennsylvania. 
<P> 
Spread over 2,000 acres in southeast Pennsylvania, Hidden Valley sits in the middle of 25,000 acres of scenic parklands. 
<P>
The Golf Club at Hidden Valley, a par-72, 6,579-yard layout is spread over a mountaintop, 3,000 feet above sea level. The course was selected as one of the best courses in the Mid-Atlantic by readers of Tee Time magazine. 
<P>
"Hidden Valley is just beautiful. It's very picturesque. It's pretty challenging  also," Rohac says. <P>The resort offers three packages. The first, called Top Of The Tee, includes accommodations in the lodge, one day of unlimited golf, cart and resort amenities for $79. 
<P>
The On The Green package includes accommodations at the lodge, breakfast, one bucket of range balls, one day of unlimited golf, cart rental for 18 holes, sports club and resort amenities for $87. 
<P>
Both packages are for mid-week, per person, per night and based on double occupancy. A second day may be added for $36. 
<P>
The Fairway package is a weekend package that includes one-night accommodation at the lodge, breakfast, two days of unlimited golf, cart use for 18 holes each day, overnight bag storage, sports club and resort amenities for $159. Rates per person are based on double occupancy. 
<P>
The club professionals can also set up tournaments, exhibitions, clinics and videotape your game. 
<P>
Golf club amenities include a full service pro shop, golf cart rental, club rental and storage, a practice range and a club house restaurant. 
<P>
Many different types of accommodations are available, including contemporary three- and four-bedroom townhouses located along the golf course. 
<P>
<H2>Linden Hall </H2>
The Laurel Highlands countryside serves as the setting for Linden Hall's 6,675-yard course. 
<P>
With no parallel fairways, the course covers approximately 400 acres of land and provides an exquisite view of the countryside. The resort offers three formal golf packages. The two-day program includes unlimited golf for both days, golf cart rental, dinner and overnight accommodations starting at $121. 
<P>
The three-day program offers unlimited golf for three days, golf cart rentals, dinners each evening and over-night accommodations starting at $215.
<P>
The four-day program offers unlimited golf and cart rental each day, three dinners and overnight accommodations starting at $308. 
<P>
Linden Hall also offers fine dining, swimming, tennis, fishing, a mansion tour and picnics. It can also handle banquets, receptions, meetings  and conferences. <P>
<H2>Avalon Inn </H2>
Located between Pittsburgh and Cleveland, Avalon Inn offers a perfect getaway for you and a guest. 
<P>
The Perfect Twosome package is available for double occupancy for one bed at $209.95. Double occupancy for two beds runs $219.95. The offer is valid Sunday through Thursday. 
<P>
Overnight accommodations, dinner for two, breakfast for two, one round of golf, cart rental, a towel and two sleeves of golf balls are included when you step onto the par-71, 6,224-yard Avalon South Course. There also is the Avalon Lakes course. 
<P>
"You have to be playing well to play it," says Bob Urban, a retiree from Greensburg. "You just have to hit the ball straight because there is water and sand here and there. If you hit the ball left or right, you are going to be in trouble. It's a challenging course for the average golfer." 
<P> 
The Inn also has swimming, tennis, racquetball and volleyball courts available to help entertain you.<P>
Remember, prices and packages may change without notice.<P>

<HR>  

<P align=center><B><font size = +2>Some Stretching Before Tee-Off may Save Back Pain Later</font><BR>
<I>By Jim Urban</I></B>
<P>

Rich Milesky golfs three to five times a week. He knows back pain and a golf swing go hand-in-hand. 
<P> 
"Your spine is not made for that movement," says Milesky, a 1-handicapper who plays at Shannopin Country Club in the North Hills.
<P>
"Everything in the golf swing is against the way your back is supposed to bend," Milesky says. "It is not a natural motion." 
<P> 
Not at all. 
<P>
A golfer stands facing the ball, then twists the upper half of his or her body almost 80 degrees before arching the back and throwing the pelvis forward as the club passes through the hitting zone. The entire time, the legs are right where the golfer planted them. 
<P>
So golfers have two options: Limit playing or take steps to alleviate the pain.The latter option sounds best to most players. 
<P>
Dr. Patrick DeMeo, an orthopedic surgeon and director of Allegheny General Hospital's Sports Medicine Institute, says back pain is a common occurrence among those who have played golf for many years. 
<P>
"As individuals age, minor degenerative changes involving the spine are to be expected," DeMeo says. "Golfers are at greater risk of developing pain because of the high mechanical stresses placed across their lower back. Fortunately, most low back pain is usually treated with specific flexibility and structural exercises." 
<P>
Back experts recommend a minimum 20 minutes of pre-round warmup exercises for various muscle groups, as well as calisthenics emphasizing stretching of the spine area near the waistline. 
<P>
For instance, physical therapist Geoff Patterson, a 1-handicapper who plays the region's amateur tournaments, stretches his major muscle groups from head to toe before even walking to the practice tee.  His program includes the leg stretch-ing common with runners and the shoulder stretching common among weightlifters. 
<P>
Patterson says he receives some odd looks from other golfers who see him with one leg propped up against a wall to stretch his hamstrings. 
<P>
"Then I get on the course and see all these golfers who are suffering from back pain and are doing nothing to take care of it," says Patterson, who works at Eagle Physical Therapy's facility in Robinson Township.
<P>
Most golfers, one of Patterson's colleagues notes, arrive at the course just minutes before their tee time and go through no warmup exercises at all. 
<P>
"These are the guys who are tying their shoes on the first tee," says William P. Rogers, another Eagle physical therapist. 
<P>
Professionals, including Jack Nicklaus, Fred Couples and Greensburg native Rocco Mediate have suffered through their share of back troubles and were able to return to the game after committing themselves to a strenuous flexibility program. Nicklaus, particularly, espouses the benefits he gained from hours of flexibility exercises. Those who regularly watch him play have noticed that Nicklaus is hitting the ball longer since he began stretching.
<P>
Some players always will have pain, even if they go through stretching. Allegheny General's DeMeo says those golfers still can play the sport. He recommends taking ibuprofen the night before playing, two the following morning and two after the round. 
<P>
Another tip: Avoid lugging around the golf bag. Instead, hire a caddie or use a cart.
<P>

<b><FONT SIZE=+2>The Telecommunications Boom: </FONT></B><br><FONT SIZE=+1><b> Job Growth is Expected, But Will It Come?</FONT SIZE></b><br>
 <i>By Paul Kengor</i>
<hr>

When a computer glitch hit Mellon Bank in years past, Mellon programmers who were on call had to drop whatever they were doing, hightail it into the office and correct the problem. Sometimes the trouble call came at 11 p.m. as they crawled into bed. Sometimes the call came in the midst of their spouse's birthday party on a Saturday afternoon. <P> Today, the trouble calls still come, but telecommunications technology allows the programmers to plop themselves down at their home computer, access the Mellon system and remedy the problem from home with a few keystrokes. <P> "The programmers love it," says Marty Lippert, Mellon's senior vice president for information management and research. "Their spouses love it too."Mellon's use of telecommunications is an example of how the technology has changed the way most companies do business. Because of telecommunications, companies are saving time and money. The result: They are more efficient and more competitive. <P>Most of these same companies are constantly looking for new ways to leverage telecommunications technology in a manner that pays a return. The market demand for telecommunications technology and services has firms in the industry thriving. Since hundreds of these firms are located in western Pennsylvania, that means jobs for the region. v "The more dramatic part of Pittsburgh's economy is emerging in areas such as the telecommunications industry," says Tim Parks, president of the Pittsburgh High Technology Council. "I feel that we could make the southwestern Pennsylvania region the center of an info-tech revolution. You have a confluence of a number of different technologies manifesting themselves here at a  precipitous moment for this telecom revolution."That moment is now, and the timing appears to be right. 
<P> 
<font size =+2><B>Timing </B></font size> <BR>
Not too long ago, many companies balked at widespread use of telecommunications technology because of the expense involved. Prices have since declined, motivating companies like Mellon Bank to take a closer look at technology that before may have been too costly. <P>"Two years ago it would have cost us four times what it costs us today for transmission," says Mellon's Lippert, who expects the price decline to continue. <P> In Pittsburgh and Philadelphia this summer, Mellon Bank was testing video conferencing at suburban branch offices. Mellon customers seeking investment advice could sit down at a computer terminal in Mellon's Monroeville financial center and have a video conference with a counselor at one of Mellon's corporate centers downtown. It saves the customer a trip into town. <P>"We are providing better services and providing those services at more competitive costs," Lippert says. "Telecommunications technology also gives us the ability to roll out new services that before might have been cost-prohibitive." <P> Other banks, healthcare facilities, advertising agencies, law and accounting firms, small businesses and manufacturers are among many companies now using telecommunications in their business processes. <P> At the downtown law firm of Meyer, Unkovic & Scott, a recent technology upgrade now allows attorneys to communicate via computer with colleagues, clients, prospects, the court systems and vendors. <P> "It's a competitive environment for the client's business," says Jim Caliendo, administrator at the firm. "If we can cut the cost to the client by using telecommunications technology, that will make us more competitive." <P>Another law firm, Reed Smith Shaw & McClay, is experimenting with video conferencing between its numerous offices. It also communicates with clients via e-mail. <P> "Our telecommunications technology absolutely cuts costs," says Judith St. Ledger-Roty, an attorney in the firm's Washington, D.C., office. "More importantly, the client can have a document immediately instead of having to wait overnight." <P> 
<font size =+2><B>Our Telecommunications Industry </B></font size> <BR>
The state Department of Labor and Industry estimates that 2,374 high technology firms employed 84,047 people in western Pennsylvania in 1993, the most recent year for which statistics are available. Of those firms, 858, or 36 percent, were involved with information and communication technologies. These telecommunications firms employed 20,069 people. <P> The total number of 84,047 high technology employees is actually less than the 84,269 employed in this region in 1979. But don't be misled by the numbers. In 1979, 61 percent of the high technology employees worked for companies with more than 500 employees: the Westinghouses, PPGs and Alcoas of the region. In 1993, 73 percent of the region's high technology employees worked for companies with less than 500 employees. <P> "Most of those companies are young, promising and, hopefully in many cases, are growth companies," says Parks. <P> Foremost is FORE Systems, the Warrendale-based firm that designs and manufactures systems to speed the transfer of information over computer networks via asynchronous transfer mode technology. <P> FORE's story is widely known, but worth repeating. It started with four Carnegie Mellon University researchers whose sales totaled $110,000 in 1991. Now, FORE employs more than 400 people, is looking to build a headquarters and tallied $75.6 million in sales during the most recent fiscal year that ended March 31, 1995. <P>FORE now dwarfs most of the firms in the southwestern Pennsylvania telecommunications industry. Many of the firms are niche companies -- small- to medium-sized manufacturing or service-based firms employing under 100 people and looking for their own inroad into the widening telecommunications marketplace. <P> Concepts in Communication, for instance, employs 14 people in Pittsburgh along with other installers and sales associates located across the country. It has found its niche in interactive voice response, a common application in the banking and insurance industries. If you have ever called a bank that asks you to enter your banking card number, then you are using an IVR service. Concepts in Communi-cation sees the healthcare industry as its growth opportunity. <P> "One of our innovations is when a patient is discharged from a [hospital] room, the volunteer or escort -- using our technology -- can pick up a telephone, enter the patient's ID number, and inform the admitting desk that the bed is now open and alert the housekeeping supervisor that the room needs to be cleaned," says Gene Nacey, CEO of Concepts in Communication. <P> The firm has signed on 115 hospitals throughout the country, including a number locally. Concepts in Communication also signed a deal with Marriott -- which has a hospital services division that manages food, housekeeping and maintenance -- to install 180 systems over the next three years. <P> "The beauty of the product is that the telephone is universal; there's no computer-training phobia. Also, there are telephones all over a hospital, in every room -- unlike computers," Nacey says.The company also has developed a sophisticated patient tracking system that relies on telephone-based technology to monitor an individual's whereabouts throughout the hospital. <P>"The most under-utilized piece of technology in the hospital is the telephone," Nacey says. "And in most hospitals, the most progressive thing they're doing with the telephone is voice mail, and there's much more than that. The great thing about this system is that [the hospital] has already paid for the telephone installation. We're really excited. This is a niche that's wide open, and the market has been very receptive to us." <P> Other local firms are exploring another niche market: high definition television. HDTV uses higher numbers of scan lines to provide a near-film-quality picture. There are about 1,400 television stations operating in the United States, all of which broadcast using standard analog signals. By 1996, the FCC will enact requirements for all stations to convert to HDTV by 2011. Broadcast stations will have 15 years to start phasing out the existing analog format. As a result, there is now a market with all 1,400 stations for new HDTV equipment."And that's just in the U.S.," says Dave Neff, a vice president in ITS Corp.'s broadcast systems division. "We're anticipating HDTV really happening in this country in the next year or two. The rest of the world will follow. It's a substantial market. We're developing products that will allow us to compete in HDTV." ITS, in conjunction with CMU and Ben Franklin Technology Center of Western Pennsylvania, is devising a method for adapting analog transmitters to a HDTV format. <P>ITS President Bob Unetich expects the HDTV market to hit $1 billion per year. "We're trying to develop a niche business where we can focus on something that no one else does," he says. "We're not trying to be Apple or Macintosh here." <P> Others jumping on the HDTV bandwagon include Television Computer Inc., which is owned by Robert H. Thibadeau, a senior research scientist at CMU's Robotics Institute. <P> "When the digital broadcasts begin, HDTV will use no more than half the digital space available on the channel," Thibadeau says. "Fully half the channel space is available for something else. As a broadcaster, you want to be able to figure out what to do with that other half. So, we're leading the vanguard in developing content for digital TV -- for that other half."

<font size =+2><B>Tapping Foreign Markets </B></font size> <BR>
Much of the growth by local telecommunications firms will hinge on how effectively they sell in foreign markets. "Firms on the equipment side can try to sell their telephone switches, data communications equipment or fiber optic cable internationally. Then there's the service itself, which requires putting the wire in place internationally," says Carnegie Mellon professor Marvin Sirbu. <P>"We're doing more than one-third of our business abroad, all over the world, but mostly in developing countries," Unetich of ITS says. "There's more privatization and less government control throughout the world. We're extremely optimistic about overseas export markets. Our wireless equipment provides a way for suppliers to bring information to people in a hurry."In China, for instance, ITS is developing distribution through a Beijing company. <P> "An employee of ours in China works with our distributor, who imports products from the U.S.," Unetich says. <P>"We supply TV transmission hardware, which is our specialty. It's how American companies like ours can succeed as a niche business," Unetich says. <P>Black Box, a Washington County-based distributor of computer and telecommunications networking products, had $165 million in revenues in 1994, with $62.1 million from non-domestic sources. <P> Jeffery M. Boetticher, president and CEO of Black Box, expects 50 percent of the company's revenues in the next three years to come from international sources, where growth opportunities exist in cellular communications. <P>"The use of cellular communications in the United Kingdom is growing by leaps and bounds," Boetticher says. "The demand for cellular in Japan is rampant. I think there's more people in Tokyo using cellular communications than anywhere, except maybe Mexico City." <P> The Future <P>The jobs will come. vAn independent study of high technology growth markets projected that 1,051 high technology jobs would be created in the region during the next 12 months. The study released in June by CorpTech ranked the region 10th nationally. CorpTech listed San Jose, Calif., No. 1 with an estimated job growth of 1,933. Southwestern Pennsylvania ranked ahead of such notables as Sunnyvale, Calif., and Austin, Texas. <P> The public seems to sense the po-tential, too, judging by the types of students enrolling at the local universities. <P> "A lot of our students are part-time students who are going back for a career change," says Martin Weiss, an associate professor of telecommunications and information science at the University of Pittsburgh. "We get quite a number of people from the major companies, such as Westinghouse, as well as a number of small consulting companies. These students recognize the shift in the economy towards telecommunications." <P>The CorpTech study did not gauge how many of the projected jobs would involve telecommunications, but those in the industry expect the number to be substantial. Use your imagination, one insider suggested. <P> "Here's what I envision within five years," says Jim Bevington, vice president of DeltaCom, a Pittsburgh-based telecommunications management firm. "At work, you'll have a PC on your desk with a headset attached to it, and a voiceboard on that PC. Your PC could have a telephone number -- a direct inward dial. If you are not there to take a call through your headset, your computer will take whatever information you need. And as video technology quickly evolves, you may also be able to get not only a message on who called but also a picture of them." <P> When that scenario becomes reality, expect many companies to spend the money to bring such equipment on-line, keeping the telecommunications industry busy. <P>"Virtually every facet of our business, commerce and every aspect of our lives is being changed by information technology," says Parks, the High Technology Council president. "From the factory floor to back offices, the incredibly growing value of information access -- on products, consumer wishes and so forth -- will be the key differentiator in business success -- between those who win or lose. <P> "It's exciting stuff," Parks says. "And it's real. This is one industry and region where you don't have to wait to see it happen; it's happening quickly.  The shift from an economy based on raw materials to one based on knowledge is happening all over the world, but it's a big contrast from what drove this region's economy 25 years ago."

<font size =+2><B>Klink: Debating Telecommunications Legislation </B></font size> <BR>
Before Congressman Ron Klink ever won his House seat, he talked on the campaign trail about securing a seat, if elected, on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. <P>"People didn't understand why," recalls Klink, who knew then that this committee, known today as the House Commerce Committee, would consider legislation regulating the telecommunications industry. <P> "I knew we would be taking up bills like [the Communications Act of 1995]," Klink, who sits on the House Commerce Committee's Telecommunications Subcommittee says. "If we don't have a representative from southwestern Pennsylvania sitting in on these negotiations, we're really going to be left behind. This legislation is so important to the future of the next five or six generations of residents of southwestern Pennsylvania that it's inconceivable." <P>Beyond the possibility of regulation that could burden telecommunications firms from the region, Klink has aggressively tackled other issues. For one, he sponsored an amendment that would require the U.S. Attorney General to report to Congress on the enforceability of current laws on the distribution of obscenity and child pornography on the Internet. <P>"I'm concerned about the proliferation of child pornography and pedophiles using the Internet in search of innocent children," Klink says. "In the 50s and 60s we worried about the guy in the park with the trenchcoat. Now those people are surfing the Internet. I've spoken to law enforcement officials who pose as sexually confused young boys [on the Internet]. Within hours there will be hundreds of responses by pedophiles talking [in] sexually explicit language. v"We're looking at what we can do legally without infringing on civil liberties," Klink says. <P>Another issue Klink is closely monitoring is foreign ownership in the telecommunications industry. <P> "You get into national security problems, such as terrorist groups -- like Hamas or Hezbollah -- gaining access to information and causing problems in this country. The White House would need to monitor this. Or let's say that you have a wealthy Middle East businessman from Iran who owns a big American media company. The Shah is in power. All of a sudden the Shah is out and the ayatollah comes in and nationalizes the company and owns a major U.S. media outlet, and can broadcast on a U.S. radio or TV station." <P> "There is no benefit to foreign ownership aside from an infusion of capital to drive up stock prices," Klink added. "A newspaper is okay. ... They can own as many newspapers as they want. Because to run a newspaper you don't need a license. A radio station is different because the frequency it's broadcast on is owned by the American taxpayers, and you need a license from the government."

<B><FONT SIZE=+2><B>Leasing Has Its Benefits,</B></FONT></B><br>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Especially With Technology</B></FONT SIZE><br><i>By Patricia Berti-Sullivan</i>
<hr>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B> </B></FONT SIZE><br>
Gary Sokulski remembers the days when his purchasing decisions were driven by a simple factor: cost. Today, rapidly developing technology has added to the mix another factor -- obsolescence. Sokulski knows that a desktop computer he procures for one of the 350 attorneys in Reed Smith Shaw & McClay's six offices might be obsolete within six months. <P> If the firm owns the obsolete computer, it is stuck with it. If it has a lease that includes upgrade provisions, the firm has some options."Before, the decision to lease or buy was based only on economics," says Sokulski, director of administrative projects and services for Reed Smith. "Now, the decision goes well beyond true economics. You must look at the cost to acquire directly, how quickly the technology turns and whether you need to be on the cutting edge. Now, cost takes a back seat to obsolescence." <P> Reed Smith, like any business, knows that cutting-edge technology can help it run more efficiently, holding down costs while optimizing service to clients or customers. Perhaps the firm can use its technology to transmit some documents to a client via e-mail instead of paying a premium to have them sent overnight. That lessens the client's costs and allows the firm to become more competitive. <P>The trick is to know when to buy and when to lease office equipment, especially when dealing with technology. Businesses that make the right decision usually end up with an edge over those that do not.<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Benefits of Leasing </B></FONT SIZE><br>
Leasing, whether it be short- or long-term, gives the lessee more options than one who purchases equipment. Foremost among the benefits of leasing is the right to upgrade if new technology hits the market or if the current equipment is not capable of handling growth. More and more, companies are turning to leasing and renting equipment as a way to avoid getting stuck with the modern-day equivalent of a buggy whip. <P>The Equipment Leasing Association of America estimates that 80 percent of U.S. companies lease equipment. Businesses like the flexibility and the cost savings. Rather than deal with depreciation schedules, the lessee makes the lease payment and deducts it as a business expense. <P>The types of leases include a conventional lease, in which the user can renew the lease for a newer model when the lease expires or just return the equipment and cancel the lease. Another type is the straight financing lease, which is like renting to own. The company owns the leased equipment when the last payment of the contract is made. <P>A third type is the fair market value lease, under which both parties agree at the time the lease is drawn on a value for the equipment at which the user can opt to purchase it when the lease expires. The price is usually determined as a percentage of the total unit price, often based on how much its value has depreciated.<P> 
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Technology </B></FONT SIZE><br>
A common scenario from the past had a company buying technology, then keeping it after it was outdated because of the investment that was made. At the same time, perhaps, a competitor was using more state-of-the-art equipment that allowed it to run more efficiently and, in turn, offer its product or service at a lower price. <P>Leasing allows businesses to protect against such a scenario, according to one finance company executive. "Leasing lets you pass the risk on to the lessor," says Frederick Summers, president and chief executive officer of Vision Financial in downtown Pittsburgh. "Profits are generated by using equipment, not owning it."In some cases, it is not necessary to have state-of-the-art technology in every facet of the business. At Reed Smith, for example, computers placed in a conference room are less sophisticated than the computers at the attorneys' individual desks. The conference room computers were purchased, but the cutting-edge computers in the attorneys' offices are leased. <P> "One of the misnomers is that you should always lease computers because they go out of fashion very quickly," Sokulski says. "That may be true, but it depends -- leasing is more expensive. We try to make informed decisions."<P> 
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Cash Flow </B></FONT SIZE><br>
When worries about obsolescence don't come into play, the decision to lease or buy usually reverts back to cost. This is more common in furniture purchases. <P>If cost is high, the business may not have the capital to cover the cost upfront. Consider an expanding business that must procure desks, chairs and other office furniture for new hires. It might face the same expense as a downsizing business that is merely looking to become more efficient by replacing its existing computers.By purchasing the equipment, a business in either situation would be faced with the capital outlay upfront, or a financing arrangement that includes profit-eroding interest charges. <P> By leasing, the company saves cash and gets equipment it desires but might otherwise have been unable to afford. For that reason, leases are particularly popular among new businesses, many of which are investing their capital other ways. By leasing, the company can use the equipment to generate revenue while facing only monthly lease payments and avoiding a huge cash outlay. <P> Beyond technology, many businesses use leases to acquire office furnishings. <P>"You are not tying up cash," says Dave Sauter, senior vice president of Delta Furniture Rental & Sales. "Renting enables companies, especially small- to mid-sized companies, to afford nice-looking, ergonomically correct furniture without spending a fortune." <P>Larger companies also look to leasing. With so many corporations downsizing, many look to consultants and temporary employees to complete tasks, but they need desks, chairs and other equipment. Some rentals last from a day or two to a couple years. When the workers pack up and leave, the corporation ships the equipment or furniture back to the supplier."Corporations are prime customers for renting. They take care of short-term needs and short-term tasks," says Jim Droney Jr., president of Mount Lebanon Office Equipment Co.<P> 
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Ownership </B></FONT SIZE><br>
Many businesses still opt for ownership, which means complete control over the equipment. In the long run, buying office equipment is cheaper than leasing if there is no intention to upgrade equipment and the cash isn't needed to be invested elsewhere. Don't forget, the equipment can later be sold, recouping some of the initial investment.	
<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>The Copier Choice </B></FONT SIZE><br>
Even though businesses are permitted to depreciate copiers over five years, many businesses have turned to leasing because they change copiers every three years or so. But even leases were problematic because many were long-term and did not take into account the changing needs of the business. <P>Now, copier procurement has become a science. <P>Companies pay a monthly rate based on the volume of copying and the length of time they use a machine. A chief benefit of the practice, known as copy management, is that the company can move up to a higher machine without affecting lease terms. <P>"The lease is no longer tied to an asset [the copier] and its terms can change if needs change," says Leonard Lutes, president and chief executive officer of Van Dyk Business Systems in Greentree. "It's really popular over the last two years or so." <P> Lutes says the average copier is replaced every 38 months. Companies will try to project their copying needs well into the future, but often times they over- or underestimate. "With copy management, you get the equipment you want and you can meet your needs without overbuying," Lutes says. <P>Businesses must be careful to not mistake a per-copy lease for copy management. Cost per copy is merely a lease, often without upgrade terms. <P> Lutes says companies should consider leasing a copier when it involves an investment of $5,000 or more, and it takes about 3,000 copies a month for copy management to be cost-effective.

<B><FONT SIZE=+2><B>Mind Over Matter</B></FONT></B><br>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Compelling new evidence shows you are how you think.</B></FONT SIZE><br><i>By By Lydia Strohl</i>
<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B> </B></FONT SIZE><br>
"I was a walking time bomb," says Bruce J., a traveling salesman in the competitive food industry for 18 years. "My habits were just terrible. I'd eat sample food all day, then get back to my room at 9:00 or 10:00 every night and have a couple drinks." <P> Still, Bruce was surprised when, in 1992, at the age of 44, he had a heart attack. <P>  "It was all downhill after that," says Bruce, then an overweight smoker. "I was recuperating from the heart attack and found out I had cirrhosis, because the liver breaks down the heart medication." <P> Bruce has been on disability since the attack, and now says he is ready to get back on the job. His treatment? A regimen that included psychotherapy and daily doses of the anti-depressant Zoloft. <P> "I think my ticker is working pretty good," says Bruce. "I'm not dependent on pills anymore. I've turned everything around -- I'm calmer than I've ever been." <P> He hasn't had a cigarette since the heart attack and shed 70 pounds, partly due to a walking program. <P> Bruce's case is exemplary of research proving that in medical treatment, the mind matters. It's a mistake to equate attention to a patient's emotional state with the pat after a particularly painful shot -- a nice gesture that, although it makes the patient feel better, is ultimately unnecessary. Looking after patient psychology is, say advocates, the most cost-effective healthcare strategy available. But most doctors, mired in their need for scientific evidence, are still skeptical about the commonsensical notion of treating the mind to cure a physical ill. <P> "Since 1644, physicians have traditionally thought of amount of pain as directly related to amount of physical damage," says Dennis Turk, professor of anesthesiology and director of the Pain Evaluation and Treatment Institute at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. "For example, the pain from an eighth-inch cut will be twice the pain from a sixteenth-inch cut. That's what all physicians learned, and that's what they still learn." <P> But Turk points out that an anesthetized patient will feel nothing from an incision that would make a conscious person screech. <P> "We interpret pain. It's a body's response, a perception," says Turk, who has been researching the role psychological factors play in this perception, and in how a patient experiences pain. "It turns out that pain is not all that related to physical pathology -- this is where the mind comes in." <P> The last 15 years have brought us light-years forward in sophisticated medical testing technology, along with which has started to come some hard data demonstrating direct linkages between the body and brain. In one study, Turk and his researchers asked subjects with chronic low back pain to identify recent instances in which their pain was the worst -- to think about who was there, what was on their mind and any situations of conflict. They hooked the subjects up to electrodes, which indicate pain by measuring muscle contractions, and asked them to relax. Then the subjects were asked to talk about the painful situations. <P> "They showed an increase [in the contractions] of 200 to 800 percent just talking about their pain," says Turk. "But the increase was only at the site of their pain. Every time they got upset, they tensed these specific muscles." <P> Turk's conclusion: Psychological factors appear to magnify existing pain. In very few cases, he says, is the pain completely without physical basis. <P> Other studies in Pittsburgh and around the world have verified the strong linkages between mind and matter. The research into these linkages has bred a new discipline called psychoneuroimmunology, or PNI. It got its start in the late 1970s when neuroscientist Karen Bulloch, then a graduate student, uncovered a direct neurological link between the brain and the immune system. <P> Researchers have since found chemicals, produced by the immune system, which feed signals back to the brain. Karl Goodkin and his colleagues at the University of Miami reported results of one study, which discovered that homosexual men infected with HIV yet displaying no symptoms of AIDS had higher levels of helper T-cells, which are infection-fighting white blood cells, when they had effective coping strategies and low levels of life stress. <P> Even though the connections between physical health and mental wellness have now been demonstrated in study after study, just exactly how they are linked continues to elude researchers. <P> "There is considerable evidence for links between stress and infectious disease, including a number of studies that have shown that patients with increased levels of stress have greater levels of upper respiratory disease," says Sheldon Cohen, professor of psychology at Carnegie Mellon University. Cohen and his team interview their subjects to evaluate stress levels, as well as measuring biological markers of stress such as levels of hormones like cortizol, epinephren and neuro-epinephren. Then they expose the subjects to an upper respiratory infection, such as the common cold virus. <P> "The evidence that's conclusive, however, is in the realm of upper respiratory disease -- and it's not yet clear what the mechanisms are. Thus far we've been unsuccessful at identifying the processes," Cohen says. He and his team are proceeding, but slowly. <P> Research in this arena is problematic, to the extent that it is difficult to control all the variables. Researchers can't, for example, pick a sample population based on psychological makeup and then give half the group AIDS. For more severe diseases, researchers must rely on patients who are already sick, which adds another whole set of variables, perhaps even depression itself.Plus, the work is expensive, and funding in this area, as in most, is getting harder to find. <P> "It's difficult to get funding for anything. But there's not a lot of focus on this area; medical research is very molecular and biology focused right now. Funding is very political, and the current biases [in Washington] are against behavioral issues in health," says Cohen, citing a House proposition to dissemble the behavioral and social science arm of the National Science Foundation. "I think that's amazing. I think it's important to understand the role of social and environmental factors in disease. These are things that can potentially be controlled at a much lower cost for the healthcare system and for the individual than the usual medical interventions." <P> It may be that these psychological treatments are more effective, as well. For 31 years, 55-year-old Jane T., a Pittsburgh educator, has been battling pain caused by fibromyalgia, a progressive syndrome of unknown origin that spasms muscles, causing pain in all four quadrants of the human body. Searching for relief from her pain, she consulted arthritis specialists, orthopedics, chiropractors, had cortizone shots, even attended chronic pain clinics. By the late 1980s she could not hold a book long enough to read it to her daughter, or move her hands well enough to play the piano. <P> Today Jane takes anti-depressants, goes to therapy and uses biofeedback, imagery and relaxation techniques taught to her by her psychologist. <P> "I am 80 percent better, and most of that has resulted from the psychotherapy," says Jane, convinced that these techniques, and the stress relief they afford her, are responsible for the turnaround. She doesn't need to know why it works -- she is convinced of the strong link between her mind and her pain. "I grind my teeth in my sleep. Is that a physical condition or a mental one, that I am so anxious that I grind my teeth in my sleep until I have TMJ?" <P> "Yes, there's a connection," says Dr. E. Carroll Curtis, medical director for occupational health programs at Harmarville Rehabilitation Centers. "How clear is it? In 1900, medicine was 1 percent science. Now, it's maybe 5 percent -- we have a long way to go. And there is still a lot of skepticism. Physicians try to be pathological machinists -- many are uncomfortable in realms that are less clear-cut." <P> Curtis is convinced that doctors are ignoring the interaction of psychological and physical factors at a tremendous cost to individuals, societies and businesses. Much of this cost shows up under the label of workers' compensation, a phrase at the top of the minds of many of Curtis' patients. <P> "The largest cost in workers' compensation is due to disability, not injury. Impairment is a medical term, but disability is a mind-set. More years of productive life are lost to Americans due to disability -- and that's sad. We enable people to be disabled. No one can get better if the benefits they are seeking are only available if they are sick. Then they begin to believe they are disabled -- and if you believe it, you get that way," Curtis says. <P> Pitt's Dennis Turk was an expert consultant to the Commission on the Evaluation of Pain for the Social Security Commission. <P> "Disability is supposed to be based solely on physical pathology, but we found little relation between medical pathology and receiving disability compensation," says Turk, "which means that the decision makers are basing their decisions on other factors." <P> After the report was finished, he asked fellow commission member Judge Paul Rosenthal what factors he used to assess the validity of a workers' comp claim. "He said that in addition to looking at the physical pathology, he looked at the person's face, and how they move, whether they were squirming in their seat," recalls Turk. <P> Rewarding for these "pain behaviors," says Turk, "leads to more maladaptive behavior."Responses from employers, family and others can also condition pain responses. Turk works with patients and their families to teach them appropriate responses. Employers can work on this too, by offering workplace programs and counseling managers on proactively rewarding employees for good work. <P> "Employers who don't treat their workers with respect are just asking for it," says Curtis, who was formerly medical director at Westinghouse Electric Corp. He believes mental health and chemical dependency programs are the most cost-effective preventive healthcare measures available. Currently, companies spend about 20 cents of every healthcare dollar on these programs. <P> But there's no way to completely destress life. So Curtis insists there must be a  shift in the way healthcare is delivered in order to balance the system. <P> "Our medical training has failed us in the arena of human concerns that go beyond the physical," says Curtis. "Primarily, an examination has become ordering tests, so we spend less time with the patient. All research says that 90 to 100 percent of the diagnosis comes from talking to the patient. In Britain there are fewer MRIs in the whole country than we have in Pittsburgh alone. They can't just order a test. But they make excellent diagnoses, and they do it on the basis of talking to patients." <P> A healthcare system that pays physicians for tests rather than time spent with patients reinforces this focus on physical pathology. But that's the answer. <P> "Think about it -- if everyone with the same diagnosis gets the same treatment, and some aren't responding, then you'd save a lot of money if you were giving people what they really need," says Turk. "We're trying to get to the point where there's a psycho-social diagnosis and a medical diagnosis, and a menu of treatment options that match each diagnosis."He stresses that though behavioral evaluations, in the form of self-reports, could be completed ahead of time and computer-scored, "there's never a way to get physicians away from having to talk to patients." <P> The question is again one of process: How can the healthcare system teach, and then motivate, physicians to talk to their patients? So what if we don't know why -- making the mind matter may be one prong in the attack against rising healthcare costs. Not to mention the fact that it could just be the cure, or aid the cure, for many people. Adding some psychological component to standard medical practices should be a no-brainer.

<FONT SIZE=+3><IMG ALIGN=left SRC="../pictures/publisher.gif"> </FONT SIZE><FONT SIZE=+2>Don't Fight Innovation in our Schools </FONT SIZE><i> By Linda A. Dickerson</i><P>
That's not the way it was when I was in school" will echo throughout the living rooms of southwestern Pennsylvania as schools once again roll out this year's innovations in teaching practices. The outcome is predictable. Over time, angry and ill-informed parents or political leaders will squelch the innovation. Status quo will return. <P> As students march in to area classrooms this September, a lucky few will confront new opportunities to expand their minds. Emerging technologies, progressive curriculum writers and entrepreneurial administrators will create innovative learning environments. Sadly, I predict that their spirited efforts will not flourish and expand. <P> Unfortunately, innovation is rarely, if ever, rewarded in today's public schools. A potent but undiscovered law of nature ultimately returns our classrooms to the way they were 20, 30, or even 50 years ago. <P>If Sir Isaac Newton were alive today, he would be able to quantify, define and name this inertial force which precludes schools from moving ahead. I will call it the rubber band effect. When you stretch schools, they always return to their original state, unchanged by the experience. <P>The forces stretching schools these days are societal pressures: the break-up of the family unit, a pervasive sense of hopelessness among disadvantaged populations of youth, exponential increases in teen pregnancies, and the emergence of a burgeoning youth underclass. The status quo represents a safety zone for schools struggling to cope with the further deterioration of our society. Under stress, the schools rely on familiar practices with predictable outcomes. <P> The forces that should be stretching and shaping our schools are globalization, teamwork, the increased complexity of workplaces, quantum advances in technology and highly diverse work environments. <P> Risk-taking is severely discouraged in public schools. Superintendents stake their careers on their ability to please a fickle public. Virtually the only sentiment that the general public seems to share about education is that habit should prevail. Most believe that chalkboards, desks in rows and textbooks are fixtures without which schools cannot function. <P>Why should schools, unlike all other institutions, be exempted from the need to change? Schools are impervious to change because the public refuses to accept innovation. The cost for this visceral opposition to change is a lost generation. <P>A sense of sameness blankets our area classrooms, dampening our young people's chance to succeed. This must stop. The public must not only accept change; they must demand it. <P>If superintendents' futures were vested in their ability to implement, not impede, change, I'd be much more optimistic about our future.

<FONT SIZE=+3><!IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="../pictures/editor.JU.gif"> </FONT SIZE><FONT SIZE=+2>Our College Graduates are Burdened With Too Much Debt </FONT SIZE><i> By Jim Urban</i><P>
Our world is one that hires on  credentials. Those who possess a bachelor's degree find doors opening more easily than those who don't have a degree. That's why education does not stop at the 12th grade in this day and age. <P> But the many high school graduates moving on to college face a problem that grows more difficult with each annual tuition increase: How will they pay for their college education without facing huge loan indebtedness once they graduate? <P> The numbers are alarming:  Four years at a public university cost an average of $26,000 today. At a private school, the average four-year tab runs $66,750. <P> Don't expect those numbers to become any more manageable as time goes on. Some educators were patting themselves on the back in 1994 for holding the average price of a college education to a 6 percent increase from the year earlier. What they didn't tell us was that the 6 percent increase was more than double the inflation rate of 2.9 percent. <P> With only so many grants or scholarships to go around, most institutions today are building the maximum amount of federal Stafford loans into their financial aid packages. That means a minimum of $17,125 in loan indebtedness for four years of education. Since many college students do not graduate in four years, the loan amount can jump to $22,625. That translates to minimum monthly loan payments of $200 for the 10 years following graduation. The amount can range higher if the schools bring other loans into the mix. <P>Perhaps it's time for parents and their children to look at college choice the way we look at business decisions: We think about the bottom line, factoring in cost and evaluating ways to reach the same objective at less expense. For example, many students today ignore one of the most inexpensive higher education options: our region's network of community colleges. Students who want a degree from a four-year school can spend the first two years at a community college before transferring their credits to the four-year school at which they wish to complete their degree. <P> Last school year, full-time undergraduates at Pitt paid $5,416 in tuition and fees, compared to $6,870 at Robert Morris and $11,879 at Duquesne, according to state education department data. The full-time tuition at the region's five community colleges ranged from $1,193 at Westmoreland County Community College to $1,760 at the Community College of Beaver County. Butler County Community College was an even $1,500, and Community College of Allegheny County cost $1,602. <P> Is this opportunity presented to the 17- and 18-year-olds deciding on college? Hardly. Many high school guidance counselors keep score as to the number of their students placed in "name" colleges or universities. The community colleges? They usually are presented to the student as the last option. <P>That's dead wrong, and it hurts us all. We can't expect a 17- or 18-year-old to understand the burden of student loan indebtedness they will face as a 22-year-old college graduate. They don't know that many recent graduates who are burdened with college loan payments struggle to afford  a car, let alone a home. Our work force suffers, too, since many of today's graduates won't consider pursuing a master's degree because of the debt they already incurred as undergraduates.With higher education costs spiraling annually beyond the rate of inflation, we can't hope for cost containment. At the present rate, today's newborns will be freshmen in 2012 and paying $70,000 to attend four years of college at a public institution.  For a private school, the typical tab would be $180,000. <P> We must educate our young people as to the burden of student loan indebtedness and present them with options to minimize it.

I am bewildered by the recent spate of writings about ethics.Queen Victoria once asked one of her ministers for advice on what course to follow on a certain matter.

The purpose of education is not to prepare good workers for business, but rather to help form productive citizens for our country. If the schools do a satisfactory job then it will naturally follow that our young people will readily adapt and contribute to our society not only in their work, but in all the diverse responsibilities required of citizens in a free society. <P> Here are my suggestions: <P>(1) Schools are not surrogate parents. <P>(2) Standards must be maintained. <P> (3) Students should dress neatly and appropriately. <P> (4) The teacher's word is the law. <P> (5) Vocational schooling should be encouraged for the noncollege bound. <P> These are just a few suggestions.

<!IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="GuestEditor.gif"> <FONT SIZE=+2><B>Clinton's Desire to Beef Up Union Bargaining Power Will Endanger Businesses, Push Up Consumer Costs</B></FONT SIZE><br><i>By John E. Lyncheski</i>
<HR>
When labor and management sit down at the negotiating table, each is holding a trump card that neither really wants to play: The union can call a strike; management can hire replacements provided the strike is over contract demands.President Clinton wants to stack the deck in favor of unions. He recently issued an executive order that bans federal agencies from contracting with companies that hire permanent replacement employees. <P> Don't mistake this action as being about employees' or workers' rights. The president's move clearly is nothing more than an attempt to give unions the edge in collective bargaining. But in the process, the president will drive up consumer costs, threaten the viability of businesses and endanger the jobs of these same union members from whom he so desperately seeks support for the 1996 election. <P> The executive order authorizes Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich to make a finding on whether a company is permanently replacing its employees. If the labor secretary so finds, he can then direct other federal agencies and departments to terminate contracts with the company or bar it from receiving federal contracts as long as the replacements remain on the job. The order affects federal contracts valued at $100,000 or more. <P> It's obvious the politicians and academicians of the Clinton administration have very little, if any, meaningful exposure to the world of collective bargaining. <P> While all employers have the option to hire replacement employees during an economic strike, very few employers actually do it. It is not a widespread practice, even though the right to hire replacement employees in economic strikes has existed, virtually unchanged, since 1938. In fact, the respective rights of employers and unions have been the same for more than 50 years. v So why substantially alter the existing balance of power in labor-management relations? <P>Let's face facts: Employers who pursue the hiring of replacement employees do so extremely reluctantly and as a last resort. Striking employees almost always are forewarned of the employer's intent to pursue replacements and are urged to return to work before replacements are hired. Even if the employer does hire replacements, the law still protects the replaced employees' status by affording them preferential rehiring rights. <P> Think about what happens when a strike shuts down an employer. Cash flow soon screeches to a halt. Many employers have substantial loans they have to satisfy without any revenue coming in. Loyal customers who used the employer's products find other suppliers, with whom they may remain after the strike ends. In some cases, the employer has no choice: It either capitulates, hires replacements or goes out of business.But sometimes, the employer's right to hire replacements plays a different role: Just like the employees' right to strike, it helps push both sides to a compromise without a protracted dispute. <P> The right to hire replacement employees is crucial to maintaining this balance in collective bargaining that in most cases allows labor and management to resolve disputes in a manner fair to both sides. Just as no employer wants a strike, no union wants its members sitting on a picket line for months on end as replacement workers collect paychecks. <P>With the Clinton administration altering this balance of bargaining power, we could see several results: <P> 	More Strikes: The unions will be quick to call a strike to take advantage of their bargaining leverage. Em-ployers will be backed into a corner. <P>	Longer Strikes: Employers will have to weather much longer strikes to obtain a reasonable settlement that won't drive the company out of business. <P>	Increased Costs to Consumers: Those employers who can't afford a lengthy strike will have to succumb to unreasonable or costly union contract demands to stay in business. Consumers will absorb the increased costs in the form of higher prices. <P>	Less Jobs: In the long term, some employers eventually will shut down because the unions will price themselves out of jobs. <P> The right to hire replacement employees is crucial to keeping the collective bargaining process just that -- a bargaining process. If the government takes away an employer's right to resort to hiring replacement workers during a prolonged strike, employers will struggle to compete and survive. When these businesses fail, you can kiss many of those union jobs goodbye. <P> John E. Lyncheski is a director with the Pittsburgh law firm of Cohen & Grigsby, P.C.

<FONT SIZE =+2><B>Specialty Steelmaker Looks Strong Six Months After Going Public</B></FONT><BR>

Not long ago, the phrase "mini-mill" wasn't especially popular around here. Recently, though, in what amounts to a boost for Pittsburgh steel production, a relatively new, relatively small company has set up shop in Bridgeville, making some of the world's finest specialty steel. <P> Universal Stainless & Alloy Products went public in December at $8 per share and has steadily worked its way up to over $12 per share recently. The company's primary products are stainless steel, tool steels and high temperature alloy steels widely used in the automotive, power generation, aerospace, food handling and chemical processing industries. <P> Universal, which is listed on the NASDAQ under the symbol USAP, is the first steel company to bring back specialty steel melting operations to the greater Pittsburgh area, and the company did it through an extremely unique and collaborative effort that involved the U.S. Steelworkers and the Duquesne Light Co. <P>The Bridgeville facility, which previously had been owned by Armco and Cyclops, employed 2,700 employees as recently as 20 years ago. Armco, which consolidated the plant's operations into its Baltimore facility in 1993, sold it to Universal last August for $3.7 million. The estimated cost to replace just the equipment in place was $112 million. And Armco indemnified Universal against any past environmental or employee benefit (pension) obligations. <P>Clarence M. "Mac" McAninch, Universal's president and CEO, is highly respected and highly incentivized. McAninch was with Armco in its Alloy Products Division from 1989 to 1994, and before that, he served at LTV Steel and Reese Tool and Metal Service Company. He and the rest of the management team as well as all roughly 100 hourly employees have a portion of their cash compensation based on pre-tax income. One of the first things the company did upon going public was to make all employees shareholders. <P> Nancy C. Moore, an analyst with Keane Securities Co., estimates Universal will earn $1.15 per share this year and $1.86 in 1996 on sales of $60 million and $83 million, respectively. <P> "USAP is on a fast track in terms of its operations, customer base, revenues and earnings," Moore said. <P> 
Around the ER Index
<DL>
<LI>The proposed acquisition of Legent Corp. by Computer Associates helped propel the ER Index to a 1.28 percent increase for the month ended June 9, versus a 0.45 percent performance by the S&P 500. The ER Index continues to lag the S&P 500 since last August 15, with the ER Index up 12.36 percent and the S&P up 14.46 percent. <P> As for the impact on Pittsburgh, where Legent employs about 350 people, we would be surprised if any significant changes are in the offing. The software development business is characterized by an unusual degree of autonomy. Duquesne Systems, the local forerunner to Legent, is a cornerstone of the company, and we don't think CA will want to alter what is already working. 
<LI>The other big mover of the month was General Nutrition Centers, which reported a 51 percent improvement in net income on a 30 percent increase in sales. Earnings per share for the quarter was 38 cents versus analyst projections of 33 cents. GNC's shares rose 17.7 percent for the month and are up more than 66 percent since August. 
<LI> The biggest loser for the month was MK Rail, which lost more than 22 percent of its value. The stock has bounced back, as the result of the release of its much delayed financial results for 1994 and the first quarter of 1995. The numbers were ugly but not unexpected. Clearly, Morrison Knudsen, the majority owner of MK Rail, is seeking a buyer for its stake. MK Rail stock is down by nearly two-thirds since August. 
<LI> Black Box Corp. has filed to sell 3.5 million shares belonging to Odyssey Partners, the New York LBO firm that bought the company in 1988. That represents half of Odyssey's stake. Odyssey will now control 22 percent of Black Box' shares, and we believe that the resulting expansion in liquidity and float should make Black Box more attractive to a wider group of investors. That should push the share price up.

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>An Eye for Fashion </B></FONT SIZE><br>
Pittsburgh's flair for fashion helps the city keep its finger on the pulse of the international marketplace. K. Barchetti Shops, one of the major players in Pittsburgh's international retail trade, was recognized by the Italian Trade Commission's Moda Made in Italy program for increasing awareness of Italian-made products in secondary markets like Pittsburgh. <P> "People are surprised to find that Pittsburgh is indeed a cosmopolitan city; though K. Barchetti Shops carries 90% European merchandise, their sales per square foot are double the national average," says Mame Bradley, Executive Director of the World Trade Center Pittsburgh. "Obviously Pittsburghers enjoy fashion when it is presented tastefully. We acknowledge the role of European fashion in Pittsburgh." <P> Retailers, like Katherine Barchetti, owner of K. Barchetti Shops, continue to enhance trade relations between Pittsburgh and Italy. "As international markets continue to expand, businesses are increasingly faced with global commoditization and competition," says Barchetti. "Our customers trust us to bring them true value with an emphasis on quality. Italy offers the finest materials in the world, and unsurpassed craftsmanship. The American consumer realizes the value of Italian merchandise."

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Do You Trust Me? </B></FONT SIZE><br>
Do you trust your boss? Does your boss trust you?Trust in the workplace was the topic of a recent survey by Development Dimensions International.  Surveying 1,108 employees in 57 service and manufacturing organizations worldwide, DDI found that 56 percent of nonmanagement employees said that lack of trust was a problem in their organization.  Nearly 70 percent said that they trusted their peers more than their supervisors. <P> Of the four groups -- peers, leaders, other teams and senior management -- senior management was the least trusted. <P>Many in the survey put communication at the top of the list of trust-building behaviors. Others included having confidence in employees' abilities, valuing what employees say, keeping promises and commitments, and working as a team. <P>Experts say trust is a basic essential in successful companies. It creates widespread cooperation, commitment and positive energy.  Nearly 95 percent of those surveyed said that they considered themselves trustworthy people, 6.37 on a scale of 7. <P>As one survey participant said, "Trust is something you earn from your fellow workers.  It is not something that comes with a position' or title.'  It takes a great deal of time and effort to earn trust and very little to lose it."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>'The Dog Ate It' </B></FONT SIZE><br>
When a process breaks down or a deadline is missed, employees often are full of excuses. It wasn't their responsibility. They didn't have enough time. They've never done it that way. <P>What hurts is that many of the excuses are legitimate. And if that's the case, it's likely that the problem is not with the employee, according to the Jacksonville, Fla.-based Leadership Development Council. <P>"We believe you need to fix the processes that run your corporation before you can fix your people, and that approach represents a paradigm shift in corporate management theory," says James Bleech, chairman of LDC and a former top executive with Meridian Engineering Inc. <P>Bleech urges companies to study organizational structures and processes, identifying the failures that allow, tolerate and sometimes force employees to offer an excuse. <P> Shred-All, a document destruction and recycling firm that includes AT&T, IBM and Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse among its clients, took Bleech's advice and saw productivity jump by 30 percent. <P> "Instead of a reactive mode, we began anticipating the problems that might prevent us from reaching goals," says Shred-All President Barry Grahek. "There is a lot of talk about thinking ahead, but too many companies are reactive. We now tell our employees, If you don't think you can fulfill the goal, you better know why you can't fulfill it and make some changes that allow you to fulfill it.' " <P> To an extent, companies like Shred-All are empowering employees to identify potential problems and recommend or take steps to solve the problems. In the end, employees feel they have more power and may be happier with the job. <P>LDC offers three-day executive retreats, a variety of seminars and individualized consulting. Bleech calls his strategy the "let's get results, not excuses, system of management."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>PNC's Plum Card </B></FONT SIZE><br>
In an apples-to-apples comparison of credit cards offered by 577 financial institutions, an independent research group is listing the Prime Value card offered by Pittsburgh-based PNC Bank as a plum. <P> CardTrak of America Inc. evaluated credit cards offered by banks, saving institutions, credit unions and firms engaging in issuing of VISA and MasterCard. <P>What makes a credit card like the Prime Value so juicy?  The top reason is interest rates: PNC offers a delicious long- term interest rate of 12.75 percent, which is about 30 percent below the national average of 18.31 percent. The other reasons CardTrak cited for ranking the PNC card so highly include its low annual fee,  which is $18 for the standard card and $28 for the gold card. CardTrak also cited adequate credit lines and a commitment from PNC to maintain interest rates below the national average. <P>Many credit-card users waste money on high interest costs and annual fees. In order to find out the facts behind the credit card sweet talk, CardTrak recommends reading the fine print in the disclosure box, which is required by federal law and can usually be found on the back of an application in small type. <P> Since most Americans carry a balance of $1,700 or more, a good long-term interest rate is important.  Another thing to keep in mind when applying are the real values of rebate programs. CardTrak estimates that on many airline VISA/ MasterCards you'd have to charge somewhere between $1,750 and $5,000 to offset the annual fee of $35 to $100. <P> Today, three out of four cards have variable interest rates, 80 percent of which are based on the prime rate with which many consumers are familiar. However, an increasing number of cards are now using the LIBOR rate instead of the prime. The LIBOR, or the London Interbank Offered Rate, makes it hard for consumers to track and compare rates.  CardTrak's advice? Discard any card offers that use this obscure index.

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>'Ever Meet Anybody Who's Been Hit By A Train?' </B></FONT SIZE><br>
asks the headline on a slick folder from the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Railroad Administration.Probably not, but 6,000 people were hit by trains in 1994. The agency spent $500,000 developing this public service campaign, which includes ad slicks, radio and TV public service announcements and camera-ready print ads. <P> In contrast, U.S. Department of Transportation's Office of Alcohol and State Programs Acting Director Jim Fell says they spent roughly the same amount on a public service campaign with the Ad Council to combat drunk driving. In 1993, 17,461 people were killed by drunk drivers. 1994 statistics were not available yet, but to date show 16,970 deaths -- which Fell says will go up. The drunk driving campaign gets a lot more bang for the buck because the Ad Council gets pro bono work for much of its campaigns, but Fell had no figures on the actual value of the campaign.

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Heart to Heart </B></FONT SIZE><br>
About 68 million Americans have heart-related disease, the leading cause of death in the U.S. To evaluate its treatment, the Pennsylvania Cost Containment Council can help. Since 1990, the group has collected statistics on the success and cost of this operation from hospitals across the state. <P> Letters from hospital administrators which accompany the study argue that these results should be taken with a grain of salt. Hospital administrators say the reporting mechanisms for the study still have not been perfected and the study did not fully take into account other conditions from which patients suffered. <P> The study found that in western Pennsylvania, Allegheny General Hospital was the only hospital reporting fewer deaths than the number expected for this procedure, losing 10 patients out of 954 who underwent the surgery. The expected range for this category is 18 to 35. Hamot Medical Center in Erie, Mercy Hospital, St. Francis Central Hospital, St. Francis Medical Center, St. Vincent Health Center, Shadyside Hospital, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Washington Hospital and Western Pennsylvania Hospital all had a similar number of deaths as expected. Only one, Westmoreland Regional Hospital, reported more deaths than expected: in 106 surgeries, five patients died; zero to four was the expected range. <P>The average cost of the procedure was also reported. Western Pennsylvania hospitals were all over the map, ranging from a low of $46,967 (Mercy Hospital) to a high of $93,743 (University of Pittsburgh Medical Center). <P> Interestingly, the study noted that women are at greater risk than men: The leading cause of death among women, cardiovascular disease caused 46 percent of all women's deaths, 40 percent for men. And nearly 44 percent of women will die within one year after a heart attack, compared to 27 percent of men.

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Remembering Chuck Muer </B></FONT SIZE><br>
When the so-called "Storm of the Century" worked its way up the East Coast in 1993, it claimed among its victims Chuck and Betty Muer, who were lost at sea off the coast of Florida. Many Pittsburghers knew the Muers, who were the founders of the Grand Concourse restaurant and the Gandy Dancer Saloon at Station Square.Now Susan Muer, daughter of the couple, has developed a cookbook as a tribute to her parents. "The Simply Great Cookbook II" features recipes from the 20 restaurants owned by the Muers, whose holdings included dining spots in Florida, Ohio and Michigan. Perhaps the best known outside of Pittsburgh are the seven Charley's Crab locations. <P>The Muers were with close friends George and Lynne Drummey off the coast of Florida when the couples disappeared in turbulent seas. Investigators suspect a 911 call placed offshore from a cellular phone was their last contact. <P>Chuck Muer had published his own cookbook five years ago. He appears on the cover of the tribute edition, seated behind plates of seafood and a glass of wine. Inside are recipes for Crabmeat Balls, Roasted Garlic Soup, Swordfish Picata, White Chocolate Mousse and dozens of other delicacies. <P>"This book is dedicated not only to the memory of Chuck and Betty Muer but also to their friends, in gratitude for the richness you brought into their lives," writes the daughter.The cookbooks are available locally at the Grand Concourse for $19.95.

Name:Ganassi.Floyd Robert "Chip" Ganassi Jr.<BR>Age:37<BR>Personal:Lives in Mt. Washington, marrying Cara Marie Small September 22, 1995<BR>Education:B.S., Finance, Duquesne University, 1982<BR>Last Vacation:Mexico, at the end of 1994 racing season.<BR>Last book read:"The Kid Stays in the Picture" by Robert Evans<P>
<HR>
Chip Ganassi, at 37, is one of the youngest team owners on the Indy Car circuit. In 1995, his Target/Chip Ganassi Racing Team (named for its largest sponsor) fielded two Reynard Ford-Cosworth entries, driven by Bryan Herta, age 24, and Jimmy Vasser, 29. Ganassi, a former driver himself, made news last spring when he added football star Joe Montana to his roster as a partner. Still a kid at heart? Most definitely. But he's playing in the big leagues now, and it's easy to see why the team's 16 sponsors think the former driver -- with his impish, "I love life" confidence, affable, expressive face and head of unruly sun-bleached hair -- can propel his team to success. ER's Lydia Strohl talked to him in his Oxford Centre office last month.<P>
<FONT SIZE =+2><B>Executive Report: How did you get involved in racing? </B></FONT>
Chip Ganassi: My father was in the asphalt paving business. He paved a go-cart track and the guy couldn't pay for it. I was like three years old. So the guy gave us three go-carts, and they sat for two or three years before I could even reach the pedals. Go-carts turned into dirt bikes. Dirt bikes turned into snowmobiles. By 18, I was racing cars, having raced all of the above before that. I learned to drive when I was 12 -- my uncle has a driving range on Route 51, and I used to drive around and pick up the golf balls. I was entering sanctioned events with motorcycles by the time I was 14 years old. So driving always came very naturally to me. <P> 
<FONT SIZE =+2><B>ER: Did you intend to make it your career?</B></FONT>
CG: I don't know that at that age I did. I guess I always thought of being in my family's business. One day I just woke up and realized I was in a small group of people who could actually drive and probably earn a living at it. And I was fortunate that I could pursue that. I grew up in a household with a lot of support from my parents. <P>I raced through my whole time in college. My first weekend as a freshman at Duquesne University was Labor Day weekend, and I didn't get there until Monday night because I was at a race. I never missed a class when I was on campus, only when I was at a race. <P> There were three different levels. I did Formula Fords for three years. Then, I did Super V, a mini-Indy class, they don't even have it any more. By the time I was a senior, I was racing Indy cars. I remember telling my economics professor that I had to miss class on Friday to go to Phoenix to be in a car race. He gave me a piece of his mind about what I wanted to be, a student or a car racer. I took a red-eye flight back and showed up at class on Monday morning. I was the star of ABC Sports World the day before, and in taking attendance he said, Mr. Ganassi, I see you weren't here on Friday, but I saw you on television yesterday.' So at least he knew I wasn't lying to him. <P> I graduated in May, turned 23 years old and qualified as the fastest rookie in the Indy 500 -- all within a 10-day period. For the next three or four years I drove for a living. You go from something costing you money to making you money with no in-between. But I didn't really intend it. It's like you know where it can possibly take you some day, but it's hard to keep in mind that the Indy 500 is out there when you're just trying to find out where you're going to get your next set of tires from. You start as a hobby, then you start doing good and you take the next step. I would have been perfectly happy with it as a hobby. <P> 
<FONT SIZE =+2><B>ER: What was the first race that you won?</B></FONT>
CG: In the fall of 1977, at Nelson's Ledges, Ohio, in a Royale Formula Ford. I had been racing everything you could think of. And the minute I got in cars, I was right there. There was nothing in the world that was unattainable in those days. No one had ever won more than five races in this series [of 14]. Myself and my best friend at the time each won six -- and the other two we didn't go to. We were bulletproof. It was a heady time. I ended up finishing third in the nation that year. My best friend was second. I couldn't advance fast enough. The next year I went to Super V. I finished third in the championship. And the next year, I went to the Indy 500. The next three of four years -- you couldn't script a more fulfilling, exciting life. I was getting paid six figures to drive cars in my early 20s. <P> 
<FONT SIZE =+2><B>ER: What was the life like?</B></FONT>
CG: All the cliches are true. That's all I can tell you. I mean, you're single. ... I don't know, it's like any other sports figure in those days. But after a while I felt like I was using my body instead of my brains. There's 33 cars in the Indy 500. If you look at the grid in 1985, of the 14 that had started the race in 1982, 11 of them had leg injuries. It was a dangerous time in racing. It's gotten much safer. I felt like I had too much to give up on -- and after five years in Indy cars without putting together a win, I thought it was time to get on with the business of racing. I thought it was time to use my education and use my experience growing up in a family business. And I seem to be much better at this. I have a lot more wins as an owner. <P>
<FONT SIZE =+2><B>ER: You once had a bad accident. What happened?</B></FONT>
CG: In 1984 I was in an accident in the Michigan 500, and was in a coma for a day. It's nothing that any race car driver doesn't expect, it's just that it's pretty horrific. Something broke in the car at about 200 miles per hour. I hit the wall, the car turned over maybe 15 times, disintegrated. I basically just hit my head hard. I had a broken hand, and some stitches in my knee, but other than that it was just lights out for a little while. <P>
<FONT SIZE =+2><B>ER: How did you make the transition from being a driver to being an owner?</B></FONT>
CG: You would think the transition would be a simple one, but it's not. I actually draw more on my experiences from family business [FRG Group, a Pittsburgh-based holding company involved in manufacturing, telecommunications and real estate] and business school than I do on my driving background. A team that I had driven for was for sale, and I acquired it after the 1987 season. In 1989 the team won the Indy 500, and we won the championship that year. We've had a great record at Indy. This year we crashed out of the lead 25 laps from the end. <P>
<FONT SIZE =+2><B>ER: What does it take to make it in racing?</B></FONT>
CG: It takes a good team, and I don't just mean a racing team. It takes a good team of mechanics, of engineers. It takes good management. It takes good sponsors -- sponsors first, probably. It takes good communication. It's not unlike any other business. <P> 
<FONT SIZE =+2><B>ER: What kind of investment does it take to get into racing? </B></FONT>
CG: It's the fourth most popular sport in the country, and the largest spectator sport -- and if you look at what it takes to run the other teams, it's less expensive.The car costs $425,000. That's without the engine. The engine's another $100,000. And you've got to have about four of them. It takes about $6-1/2 million to run one car per year -- the car's actually inexpensive. When you're talking about racing them week in and week out, that's what gets expensive. It's like picking up a traveling circus and moving it week after week. <P>
<FONT SIZE =+2><B>ER: What kind of returns can you get?</B></FONT>
CG: Depends how much you crash. Profit comes from winnings, sponsors. It's a building block thing. If you win a lot one year, you should be able to translate that into earnings the next year. For a star athlete, you should easily double your income on outside promotions. For a team, those numbers aren't the same, but you have to develop good sponsors. Like any other business, if you take in more than what you spend, you make money. <P>
<FONT SIZE =+2><B>ER: Did you capitalize the team with money you made as a driver?</B></FONT>
CG: Only about half was from that, and half was my family's money. I am the sole owner of the team. Target [an upscale discount retailer headquartered in Minneapolis] is the main sponsor of the team. We have two cars, one is Target/Scotch and one is Target/STP. <P> 
<FONT SIZE =+2><B>ER: What is your agreement with Joe Montana?</B></FONT>
CG: Joe is a partner in the team. I met Joe about five years ago, and he is from the Mon Valley also. We grew up probably 8 or 10 miles apart. I didn't know him then, but when we met we struck up a conversation about our upbringing. He was getting some calls about getting involved in racing. His agents at IMG [International Manage-ment Group, in Cleveland, Ohio] are my agents as well. And they called me and said, Montana's getting a lot of calls about being in racing, and he had this deal thrown at him. He said to call you because he'd met you, and you're from his area. Would you do the same deal?' And I said, Sure.' So I did. <P> Joe is one of the few sports personalities who I think transcends sports. When you think about winning, come from behind, team player, you think of Joe. <P>
<FONT SIZE =+2><B>ER: What kind of involvement will he have?</B></FONT>
CG: The simple thing I can point to is that he just raises everybody's game right away. Success begets a certain amount of success, and you want to keep that snowball rolling. <P>He'll be involved, talking to the team, motivating them, helping with sponsorship opportunities and developing strategies, being in our team meetings before the race, keeping everybody loose. The guy is an asset. But more importantly, he's just a nice, normal guy. <P> It was quite a feather in our cap that he announced his interest in racing right on the heels of his retirement from football. The deal was already done. But the Sports Illustrated retirement article says that he's going into Indy car racing. <P>
<FONT SIZE =+2><B>ER: Did he have any prior involvement in racing before?</B></FONT>
CG: Yes, that's how he kind of got hooked. He drove in the Toyota Celebrity race in Long Beach [Calif.] a couple times. He was never able to pursue that because his contracts would forbid it. Not that he ever wanted to be a race car driver or anything, but there's no reason he shouldn't get involved and enjoy it now. <P> 
<FONT SIZE =+2><B>ER: Will you maintain Pittsburgh as your headquarters once you are married?</B></FONT>
CG: Yes. I like Pittsburgh. It's an oasis away from racing, away from my business. I can concentrate on it here. It's home for me. It's an easy place to travel from. The quality of life here is good, and I think the cost of living here is inexpensive. <P> 
<FONT SIZE =+2><B>ER: When are you away for the race season?</B></FONT>
CG: The actual race season itself is 16 races, March through September, but the traveling doesn't stop. It's always travel, whether it's with Target or other sponsors, doing business. v 
<FONT SIZE =+2><B>ER: What kind of car do you drive?</B></FONT>
CG: A Lincoln Mark 8. Not a sports car -- I get enough of it on the weekend. <P> 
<FONT SIZE =+2><B>ER: Are you in this for the long term?</B></FONT>
CG: I'm one of the younger owners, even at 37. You can go a long time. I don't know what else I would do. I could think of some things I could do on the side, but I wouldn't have the passion that I do for this. <P> 
<FONT SIZE =+2><B>ER: Have you spun other businesses out of this?</B></FONT>
CG: Yes, I'm the importer for one of the racing cars as a side business. I introduced the Reynard chassis, from England, to Indy car racing. I am the North American distributor. We had half the field this year at the Indy 500 and it's only our second year. <P> 
<FONT SIZE =+2><B>ER: Looking back, what do you think was the turning point in your career?</B></FONT>
CG: When I got third in the Formula Fords, then in the Super V -- that's semi-pro -- I was sponsored by First Commercial Corporation, a company that's defunct now. That's where you start to get noticed. Then I went to Indy cars, and that's when I got Sea Ray, STP, Old Milwaukee beer -- that's when it really started to take off. That's what I do now, I get [sponsors] every day. I just did a deal today with Warner Lamber/Shaving products group. [Reads:] Ganassi agrees that the sponsorship rights shall be exclusive in the category of blades, razor blades and razor products.' <P>What do I give them? Two credential hard cards for VIP executives, the right to purchase credentials and tickets, press materials, provide hospitality, provide a driver for appearances, use of a show car, assist on making travel arrangements with special race discounts, cooperate in developing and implementing promotional activities. They'll be roughly this size on the car [points to Speed Stick logo] -- the more dollars, the more square inches. <P>
<FONT SIZE =+2><B>ER: Will you expand the team?</B></FONT>
CG: I think that two cars is a good size effort. If you were to ask me that question a year ago, I would have said yes. But today, I'm back into the mode of focusing. I think it's better to focus on one thing than to be everything to everybody. I used to want to be everything to everybody, today I just want to focus.

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Palio</B></FONT><BR>
<B>The Bread Alone is Worth the Trip</B>
<I>By Lydia Strohl</I>
<HR>
Palio is not for the faint-of-stomach. The rich atmosphere, the fresh, simple and abundant quantities of food, the heady Italian wines -- all bespeak Tuscany, the northwestern Italian region from which the restaurant takes its identity. <P> Palio, the menu tells you, is named for the Palio della Contrade, a tournament held in Siena's Piazza del Campo since medieval times. An intimate restaurant, seating 36 in the dining room (10 more at the long copper bar), Palio replicates an Italian trattoria, painted with faux marble and frescoes in warm golden tones, corners filled with urns of dried sunflowers. The tables are marble, the chairs mission-style oak and leather, comfortable and curiously private for such a small space. <P> On the tables are set bottles of herbed olive oil and huge pots of grated Parmesan cheese, armed with a big spoon. A loaf of hot Tuscan bread, doughy on the inside and crusty on the outside, arrives just as you do, accompanied by a spread of Gorgonzola, roasted peppers and olives. This is by far the best bread we have tasted in this town -- and worth the trip itself. The secret, according to chef Michael White, is the heat achieved by the commercial grade stone-floored oven. (Another secret -- the restaurant makes pizzas with this dough, for take-out upon request.) <P> Next, an antipasto is added to the spread of food in front of you. Endive stuffed with buffalo mozzarella, a pile of shaved ham and a marinated salad of banana and red roasted peppers, artichoke hearts and black olives was the offering that night, but the menu indicates this changes. <P>This is a meal in itself, perhaps accompanied by a bottle of wine from the heavily Italian wine list, which ranges from $20 to $40. And, for $7.95 each, it is indeed possible to just get antipasto and bread. <P> But the offerings on the entree menu, as well as the pricing structure, encourage diners on. Both range from staple (linguine marinara, $13.95) to sublime (lobster and shrimp in a sauce of vodka and cream, sprinkled with caviar, $27.95) and include the antipasto and bread. Poultry, seafood and meat entrees also come with a pasta course. Servers advise diners that with the $10 shared plate charge, it's more economical to order another entree, even if it ends up as your lunch the next day. <P>So pace yourself. The menu offers an array of pasta, chicken, veal and fish dishes like veal scaloppine, glazed with grappa and port, then pan-fried with mushrooms ($16.95), chicken breast and sausage with white beans and tomatoes ($16.95), or scallops with red peppers and spinach, pan-fried in garlic butter ($17.95). Specials include a double veal chop layered with prosciutto and fontina cheese, crumb-coated and pan-fried ($32.95), risotto with lobster, shrimp, mussels and sundried tomatoes ($27.95). If there's nothing just right on the menu, ask. The service here is as friendly and accommodating as the proverbial corner tavern. <P>We chose pasta: tagliatelle coi gamberoni, tossed with over-sized shrimp, fresh spinach and cream, and tagliarini col granchio, linguine with jumbo lump crabmeat and toasted pignoli nuts in a mild garlic butter sauce. After the festival of zesty appetizers, the pastas seemed dry and their flavor subdued. The cream sauce was extremely rich, the shrimp, as well as the portion, over-sized. The garlic butter flavored, rather than sauced, the pasta, which contained much seafood and a generous sprinkling of pignoli. It would appear that the local take-out container distributor has truly benefited from the opening of Palio. <P> For dessert we ordered ladyfingers, layered with strawberries, fresh whipped cream and cream cheese. The portion was so large that there must have been a brick of cream cheese in it (surprised?). The coffee was strong and hazelnut. <P> Chef White says his secret is high heat and flash-cooking to sear in the flavors of the fresh food. On my last visit, I tried the scaloppine alla piemontese, veal coated with breadcrumbs and topped with spinach and chestnuts. It was melt-in-your-mouth moist, made rich with the exotic combination of tastes, and I still have a lot of that in my freezer, too. <P> Just 21, White has been working for four years with owner David Ayn, who also owns the adjacent Davio. <P> "David's worked in every restaurant in Pittsburgh," says White. Four years ago, Ayn established Davio, which serves "peasant Italian," and, though it has no liquor license, is booked weeks in advance. "There are only seven tables next door, and we have a liquor license here." <P> Though Ayn based the menu on the cuisine of Tuscany, White says they experiment with unusual combinations that are often quite improvisational. <P> "Last night, I made brownies, and David and I had them with hazelnut coffee," White, who, amazingly, has no formal training, told us. "We thought -- what about brownies with hazelnut coffee in them?" <P>The "all-inclusive" pricing structure can make this a hefty evening, and be forewarned that the restaurant accepts only cash or check, no credit cards. But it's worth a trip to Palio. In a city redundant with Italian restaurants, this one clearly stands out. <P>

<b><FONT SIZE=+2> NAFTA - Did We Hafta</FONT></B><br><FONT SIZE=+1><b>A year later, a look at the treaty's effect on the local economy</FONT SIZE></b><br>
<i>By Paul Kangor</i>
<P>
On December 17, 1992, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, Presi-dent Carlos Salinas de Gortari and President George Bush signed the North American Free Trade Agreement. <P> The ceremonies marked the end of a process that began on February 5, 1991, when the three leaders an-nounced they would negotiate NAFTA. The trade accord became effective January 1, 1994.<P> The debate that ensued over NAFTA between 1991 and 1994 was contentious. The wrangling featured the usual suspects: labor vs. big business, Democrats vs. Republicans, old manufacturing sectors vs. new high-tech industries and, of course, Ross Perot vs. Al Gore. <P> Opinions in southwestern Penn-sylvania often fell along similar lines. A common division pitted elements of the region's industrial and manufacturing past against new, thriving, export-oriented, high-tech sectors. There was concern in southwestern Pennsylvania -- as throughout the nation -- that labor-intensive manufacturing sectors would lose out to cheaper Mexican labor. Conversely, the premise was    that high tech -- an area in which southwestern Pennsylvania has a distinct advantage over Mexico -- would benefit. <P> A year and a half later, the jury's still out. <P> "I wouldn't want to say anything at this point," says Jack Shea, director of organization for the International Union of Electrical Workers, a local affiliate of the AFL-CIO. "It's too early. But we may look over our shoulders a few years from now; just like we look back and see how we've lost out in radios, TVs and footwear." <P>"It's too early to see the broad picture," says Martha Harris, the deputy secretary of trade, technology and economic development for the Pennsyl-vania Department of Commerce. <P> "But there have been benefits in some industries." <P> There are some roadsigns. Post-NAFTA numbers show significant in-creases in state exports to Mexico and Canada. Anecdotal evidence points to local companies that have benefited from the agreement: some with years of experience in Mexico and others enticed by new opportunities, particularly in the environmental technology sector. Their preliminary response to NAFTA just might be "ole." <P> 
<font size =+2><B>NAFTA Defined: </B></font size> The implementation of NAFTA creates a free trade area in North America that is the largest of its kind in the world, with a combined GDP in 1992 of $6.9 trillion and 368 million consumers. Over 15 years, tariffs on goods originating in Canada, Mexico and the United States will be eliminated. <P>Before NAFTA, trade and investment between the United States and Mexico was increasing rapidly. Between 1986 and 1991, U.S. merchandise exports to Mexico rose by 168%, from $12.4 billion to $33.3 billion. As of 1992, Mexico was our third largest trading partner. <P>Before NAFTA was signed, the majority of studies showed a positive net effect. One of the best known studies was by G.C. Hufbauer and J.J. Schott, who found that NAFTA would result in the net addition of 609,000 jobs in Mexico and 130,000 in the United States in 1995. The U.S. Department of Labor and KPGM Peat Marwick both estimated gains of 60,000 jobs in the United States over 10 years. <P>Studies indicate the U.S. sectors expected to experience the largest gains from NAFTA: capital goods, chemical goods, pharmaceuticals, metals, agriculture and transportation equipment, including both finished automobiles and components for assembly. In regard to U.S. wages, most studies estimate gains by workers in high-wage segments of the work force and a decline for those in low-wage categories. <P>"Our estimates were that the first wave of dislocation would be mid-range, assembly, low-wage jobs," says Gary Hubbard of the United Steel Workers of America. "Everybody, including the Department of Labor, believed those would take the first hit." <P> 
<font size =+2><B>PA Projections: </B></font size> Despite rampant national prognosticating, few projected NAFTA's regional effects. A September 1992 study by The Trade Partnership in Washington, D.C., said Pennsylvania trade with Mexico "would be accelerated and strengthened" as a result of NAFTA, estimating job gains offsetting losses almost five-to-one. <P>The study claimed benefits would be spread throughout the Pennsylvania economy. Manufac-turing would gain from improved market access and competitiveness, while market opportunities would be expanded for Pennsyl-vania banks, insurance companies and transportation firms.The study projects that NAFTA will stimulate $294 million in business for Pennsylvania exporters over a 10-year period -- an average of $29.4 million per year -- and expand employment in Pennsylvania by more than 10,300 new jobs over 10 years. <P>Few studies narrow the focus to southwestern Pennsylvania. A lone April 1994 study by Carnegie Mellon University concluded that, in general, NAFTA will have a "marginal" effect on the region. <P>"It's really hard to get data," says the Pennsylvania Department of Commerce's Harris. "We need to bring the tracking mechanisms up to speed." <P>
<font size =+2><B>NAFTA Negatives:</B></font size> There is, however, some trackable evidence. Since NAFTA took effect, a number of U.S. companies and employee groups have filed petitions with the U.S. Department of Labor, which promised compensation to those hurt by the accord. Following the first six months of the trade pact, Pennsylvania led the nation with 26 petitions, seven of which were certified, 13 turned down and six pending. <P>"That's a fact," says Shea. "Those are things that we knew would happen. There's nobody protecting our good U.S. jobs. They're shifting production to the low-wage areas. Where would you locate a company if you could get your labor for $1 to $2 per hour without paying benefits?" <P>But using wages as a rationale for a company's location decision ignores other critical factors, such as worker productivity. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, Mexican wages are about eight times lower than American ones -- a difference offset by the fact that the average American worker is roughly eight times as productive as the average Mexican. <P>But Shea's point has some merit. <P>Take, for instance, the maquiladora program. Under the 25-year-old program, U.S. firms manufacture components that are shipped to Mexico for assembly by 560,000 Mexican workers in 2,200-plus maquila plants along the Mexican border. Finished products reenter the United States for packaging and redistribution by, say, General Motors. <P>American firms find maquilas attractive because of lower Mexican wages and a favorable tariff differential. Critics cite a loss of U.S. jobs to plants characterized by overcrowding, pollution and faulty infrastructure. <P>"We don't make radios anymore, and very few TVs," argues Shea. "We're losing them to offshore assembly in places like maquiladoras, where you have people working on dirt floors."Gary Hubbard expresses similar sentiments: "I don't want to give the appearance that we're opposed to trade. We recognize its value. But our concern is the exploitation of workers, Americans and Mexicans." <P>Those who favor NAFTA are not surprised by the fact that some labor groups have been adversely affected by the trade accord. <P> "You can't fight the structural differences in the economy," says Harris. "But the whole idea of free trade is that you try to create more advantages and more open markets." <P>Kathleen Lynch, program manager at the World Trade Center Pittsburgh, seconds that notion: "No one likes to see unemployment and dislocation. But the reality of the global economy is that those changes would take place anyway in industries of comparative disadvantage.""That's nothing more than a way for them to justify [support] for NAFTA," Shea retorts. "You have to be out there with the people losing the jobs. Go to the Mon Valley. Look at Home-stead, Braddock. People are going to say [those losses] would have happened anyway? We're giving away our industrial base. Our kids can't find jobs." <P>Some industries have been hurt in the near term by NAFTA, such as PPG Industries. Before the trade accord, PPG glass faced a 20% tariff in Mexico. While that tariff is now 16% and will be eliminated completely within 10 years, the U.S. tariff on Mexican glass was immediately reduced to zero. <P>At the end of 10 years, tariffs on glass will be zero for both countries. In the meantime, the tariff differential is hurting PPG's ability to compete with Mexican glass. As a result, company officials are lobbying for a quicker tariff reduction. <P>"The bailout package would have been a very good bargaining chip [to eliminate the glass tariff quickly]," says Kears Pollock, PPG vice president of coatings and resins. Apparently, the Clinton administration did not agree. <P>
<font size =+2><B>The Good News:</B></font size> On the sunny side of NAFTA, Pennsylvania exports to Mexico and Canada reached record levels in 1994, jumping 30.6% from 1993. Mexico, absorbing $853.8 million in Pennsyl-vania exports, is the state's second largest export market, surpassing Japan and the United Kingdom, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau's Foreign Trade Division. Exports were up in 23 of the 32 standard industry classifications that cover state exports to Mexico. <P>Of the 12 Pennsylvania industries that exported over $10 million in merchandise to Mexico in 1993, all but three saw gains in NAFTA's first year. Big increases in state exports to Mexico are among industries in the capital goods area -- specialty metals, computers, chemicals and electronics -- which potentially confirms predictions of those who stated that such sectors would be among those to benefit most from more open trade with Mexico. <P>"That's probably true," says Harris. "But I'm not comfortable in making a direct cause-and-effect leap. The im-plementation of the agreement is still early. It takes a while to develop international markets." <P>Beyond numbers, the experiences of local companies venturing into Mexico register distinct opportunity. High technology companies, in particular those from our environmental products and services cluster, are finding their services distinctly in demand. <P>"In any market things can happen quickly to alter the trends," says Lynch. "It may be too early to say that we'll have record export numbers each year, but the majority of the indicators are saying that Mexico will continue to be a growth market of opportunity, particularly in high-tech areas, such as environmental cleanup technologies. The word we're getting from Mexican officials is that there's a real sincerity about enforcement [of environmental standards]." <P>Provisions within the NAFTA environmental side agreement are forcing Mexico to impose tighter environmental standards and establish a Com-mission for Environmental Coopera-tion to ensure domestic enforcement of environmental laws. <P>
<font size =+2><B>Higher Standards:</B></font size> NAFTA could spur a multi-pronged interest in environmental cleanup. <P>"Goods and services will become more available [to Mexicans]. As consumer markets improve -- raising the standard of living -- that's going to improve municipal markets. People will become more concerned and de-manding of municipal governments to improve quality of life," says Tony Callery, international manager at the 150-employee F.B. Leopold Company Inc., a Zelienople supplier to the pot-able water market with representatives throughout Mexico. "If we can help raise the standard of living for the average Mexican, [the country] can become a better trade partner."Most Mexicans are a long way from being full-fledged consumers of the McKnight Road variety. But de-mands for improved quality of life could pressure local Mexican governments to deliver amenities like cleaner water for drinking, irrigation, etc. <P>This makes Pittsburgh a natural partner for Mexico: Nationally, southwestern Pennsylvania has the third largest concentration of environmental companies, according to the National Environmental Technologies Applica-tion Corp. A sector spawned from technologies developed to clean up Pitts-burgh's own industrial legacy of pollution, 850 southwestern Pennsylvania firms are directly or indirectly involved in environmental tech, counts the Pittsburgh High Technology Council. <P>
<font size =+2><B>Converting Pollution to Pesos:</B></font size> One local company capitalizing on NAFTA is 350-employee Chester Environmental, Inc., located in Moon Township. The company, a specialist in environmental engineering and waste-water treatment systems, signed a multimillion dollar contract in April 1994 to design and install sanitary and industrial wastewater purification systems in Saltillo, Mexico. Other big projects have followed. <P> "We had been very successful domestically, so about three years ago we decided to expand to international markets, such as Mexico and other areas," says Jim Hall, Chester vice president. "We exceeded gross revenue expectations of $4 million in international operations in 1994." <P>The company's decision to do business in Latin America had much to do with NAFTA and the region escaping its debt crisis of the late 1970s and early 1980s. <P>"We saw a serious need for water and sewage treatment with U.S. technology in Mexico, and went after this market," says Hall. "NAFTA accelerated the opening up of this market to us."Much of Chester's entree into Mexico was through existing clients, large southwestern Pennsylvania companies building plants in Mexico and finding they needed Chester's services to help them adhere to NAFTA's environmental provisions, adds Hall. <P>NAFTA environmental regulations were also the catalyst for a $20 million water treatment plant built by U.S. Filter Corp. for a resort community in Cuernavaca, Mexico in May 1994. U.S. Filter says that the increased security of investment rules liberalized by the Mexican government after the trade accord prompted their decision to get into the country. <P>U.S. Filter, a leading manufacturer of water treatment systems headquartered in Palm Desert, Calif., has more than 35 U.S. locations, including one in Warrendale, Pa., and 50 global sites.The construction and operation of the Cuernavaca facility created an estimated 600 jobs in Mexico and used nearly 11,000 cubic meters of concrete and 1,200 tons of steel. It created at least 15 jobs at U.S. Filter's facility in Warrendale, for an estimated $1 million in design work, and 30 jobs at the Rockford, Ill., plant to help fabricate   $6 million worth of specialized process equipment. <P>The project also spawned job creation among other southwestern Penn-sylvania companies. Due to the project, Chester Environmental received a "sizable" contract from U.S. Filter, adding jobs in the process. <P>U.S. Filter sees business potential in the privatization of municipal services and build-own-operate projects in Mexico."This project is a sign of our confidence in Mexico's growing economy and commitment to environmental protection," said Richard Heckmann, chairman and CEO of U.S. Filter. <P>Another local company poised to build from NAFTA is Calgon Carbon, which, among other things, specializes in infiltration media used for water purification and separation. The company, which has 343 local employees, estimates that 43% of its business is international, done primarily in Eur-ope but also in Japan and Mexico. <P>"We traded with Mexico well before NAFTA was proposed,"says John MacCrum, Calgon senior vice president. "NAFTA itself hasn't made much of a difference from a product standpoint. What will make a difference will be the enforcement of environmental regulations and the improvement in the Mexican economy as a result of NAFTA. The actual removal of tariffs won't make a big difference one way or the other." <P>MacCrum sees opportunity in Mexico, despite Mexico's recent economic trouble and peso devaluation. <P>"Environmental regulation and enforcement is a slow process in any case," says MacCrum. "The peso devaluation and current economic problems will slow that more. But the development of the market is a 10- to 15-year horizon anyway. Part of that [time frame] is based on the tariff phase-out. But there also are processes, negotiations for investment and investments themselves that take time. I mean, NAFTA was signed, but you don't just build plants overnight." <P>

<font size =+2><B>"Paperwork Nightmare": </B></font size> Creating a bureaucratic structure for NAFTA will take time, too."Every item sent down there now has to have a harmonized tariff schedule number," says Dom Palmieri, international sales representative for Mine Safety Appliances. "Shipments have been delayed because of rules of origin requirements -- it has been a paperwork nightmare." <P>Mexico, with its prominent coal mining industry, is a multimillion dollar market for MSA, which manufactures safety appliances. The company, with $500 million in 1994 worldwide sales, has been in Mexico since the '50s. <P>"We sell our complete line, in ex-cess of 4,500 items in Mexico. It's a very strong market for us," says Palmieri. "It translates into a lot of local jobs here in Pittsburgh." <P>Despite the current bureaucratic slowdowns, Palmieri is optimistic. <P>"It will get better and easier as time goes on," says Palmieri. "And there will be advantages, mainly in reduced tariffs. This will allow companies like MSA to compete favorably in a global market, because it saves us money. And a lot of our products are used by local environmental technology firms." <P>Like MacCrum, Palmieri is not overly fearful of the peso setback."It [has] created some interesting problems for us," says Palmieri. "Our advantage, however, is many years of experience. In order to be successful in Latin America you must be in the game for the long term and totally committed. The business climate remains good and will only get better." <P>
<font size =+2><B>911: </B></font size> Several local agencies have been set up to help regional companies negotiate the Mexican marketplace. One major player seems to be the World Trade Center Pittsburgh. <P>"On a regional level, our organization is involved in helping companies to identify opportunities in Mexico," says Lynch. The WTC sponsors matchmaking sessions to provide Pittsburgh companies with opportunities to meet privately with international representatives and discuss business partnerships, such as a recent three-day event trying to match local environmental technology companies with Latin American markets. "There are a lot of companies in Mexico looking for joint partners. It's our mission to help local firms identify and hook up with those companies." <P>The mission appears to be a common one. The Pennsylvania Depart-ment of Commerce's Pennsylvania Export Partnership Trade Event Pro-gram promotes trade, as does the WTC. The latter is part of a seven-member group of trade assistance or-ganizations called the Western Pennsylvania Export Consortium. The consortium brings together local, state and federal programs to provide local firms with access to trade assistance services, including market identification and assessment, market penetration and on-line and direct access services.Some groups are even putting their money where their mouth is. The Pennsylvania Department of Com-merce instituted the Pennsylvania Export Partnership Trade Event Program to incent small- and medium-sized manufacturers to enter the global marketplace. The program offers up to $2,500 (or 50% of eligible costs, whichever is less) for a company to attend an exhibit or international trade event. <P>"It's a great program for new-to-export companies," says Lynch. <P>But lack of coordination among these agencies might actually be hindering companies seeking to establish an international connection. A January 1994 report by Pitt's University Center for Social and Urban Research concluded that "foreign export assistance agencies tend to be small, understaffed and underfunded. Both duplication of services and gaps in services are perceived to exist. Further, the scattered and fragmented delivery of services creates barriers to firms receiving the full range of services needed. Export assistance agencies need to coordinate themselves and improve programs." <P>
<font size =+2><B>Reigning Confusion: </B></font size> Surprisingly, part of the problem in promoting exports among local firms is lack of interest. <P>"There's a psychology of fear among many small companies," says Rita L. Pollock, executive director, Southwestern Pennsylvania Regional Development Council. "[They feel] that exporting is only done by the big guys.' NAFTA has already helped to eliminate some of that fear. That's why NAFTA [has been] so important for exporting in general, not just to Mexico and Canada--it raised the awareness and stature of exporting among local companies." <P>To overcome such fears, Pollock recommends creating a "culture of ex-porting" with forums, publicity and education on its benefits. She says that  as more businesses have export success, others will gain confidence. <P>But it may be slow. "We'll do a mailing to 300 to 400 [companies], trying to tell them about a [trade] show," says Pollock. Sometimes such a mailing will gain as few as six responses. But inquiries about exporting are up since NAFTA passed, as are responses to export-oriented events. <P>This is a good sign that some local companies are beginning to understand the tangible benefits that can be achieved beyond the U.S. border. And the higher export numbers among the majority of state industries doing business in Canada and Mexico since NAFTA's implementation may be testament to the fact that the trade agreement seems to have benefited more industries than it hurt. But what does the future hold? 
<P>
<font size =+2><B>Tipping the Scales: </B></font size> What makes gaging the results of NAFTA problematic is that it is hard, if not impossible in many cases, to directly correlate NAFTA with any local economic results. <P>Relationships between the two economies were opening up long before NAFTA was signed, a benefit of the general economic liberalization begun under Miguel de la Madrid, continued under Carlos Salinas de Gortari and cemented in place by NAFTA. <P>But the focus put on U.S.-Mexico trade relationships with the negotiation and introduction of NAFTA is increasing interest on both sides. <P>"Trade would have happened regardless," says WTC's Lynch. "NAFTA provided a boost, particularly with the environmental side agreement. You've seen an acceleration in [trade among] high-tech areas because of NAFTA." <P>Clearly, debate will continue over whether or not NAFTA has been good for southwestern Pennsylvania. The troubled peso also makes gaging success difficult. <P>"I'm bullish on Mexico, though," says Chester Environmental's Hall. "The future is very strong. The need is there, it's just a matter of the financial situation being stabilized and everyone's trying to help. I think that by 1996 business will be good again." <P> In the meantime, the road to Mexico is opening up other doors, too. <P>"We've continued into other Latin American countries -- we continued to want to do business, and there was interest there [when Mexico was stalled]," says Hall. "We were positioned very well." <P>Ole.

<b><FONT SIZE=+2> Westmoreland County: </FONT></B><br><FONT SIZE=+1><b>A new day dawns in the east.</FONT SIZE></b><br>
<i>By Michelle Fanzo</i>
<P>
If optimism was an economic generator, the streets of Westmoreland County would be paved with gold. <P> After the wait-and-see attitudes prevalent in the early 1990s, the positive outlook for nearly every economic sector of the region is more than wishful thinking. <P> Development started looking up in 1994, but economic development officials were hesitant to prematurely predict growth for Allegheny County's neighbor to the east. This year, after a number of hospital expansions, relocation inquiries by businesses both small and large, and increasingly focused marketing campaigns, Westmoreland movers and shakers are nearly unanimous in their upbeat predictions. <P> The hot spots continue to be in the western portion of the county. Murrysville, North Huntingdon, and especially Penn Township are experiencing a combination of commercial, industrial and residential growth, spurred in great part by proximity to Pittsburgh as well as good schools and low taxes and utility rates. <P>Meanwhile, Andy Stofan, president of the Latrobe Area Chamber of Commerce, says he knows of a number of promising projects currently in the works. "What may happen here in the next few years could really make a     significant economic impact in West-moreland County. In a couple of these cases, if even one project that's currently on the boards materializes, it would really make a big difference in the community, as well as be a magnet to draw other business," says Stofan. <P>Lue Ann Pawlick, general manager of the Middle Monongahela Industrial Development Association, Inc., agrees the economic climate is improving. "I'm getting a lot of calls from companies looking for property, and everyone else is saying the same," she says. <P>Even the traditionally slow-growing northern portion of the county will soon be home to a significant riverfront development called Lighthouse Landing. "It is, in my mind, the best vote for the future of New Kensington when an individual developer invests the kind of money that this project requires," says Diane Sheets, secretary of the New Kensington Industrial Development Corporation. Developer Ron Williams is targeting completion of the project, which includes a marina, restaurant and professional complex, for fall 1997. <P>Overall, Sheets sees a healthy and growing economic climate in northern Westmoreland County. A number of smaller businesses, like Insulations Inc., have grown and are looking to move from leased space to permanent sites of their own. <P>If they can find them. Lack of developable land is deterring area growth, according to Sheets. She says the area could definitely use more spaces in the 5,000 to 8,000 square foot range as growth from other parts of the county continues to head north. <P>"I've seen the business climate improve dramatically within the last eight months," concurs Joe Sisley, marketing representative for economic development at Westmoreland County Industrial Development Corporation. The county presently has seven industrial parks, with an eighth preparing to open within a year. "We have been getting a number of inquiries in regard to the county and its industrial parks system. Many of those who call are from companies outside the county looking to expand or relocate to Westmoreland." <P>Partnerships between chambers of commerce, economic development organizations and utility companies are the key to Westmoreland's ability to adapt to a changing economic climate, says Stofan. <P>"There is great willingness to work together for common improvement, without jealousies and competitive attitudes. That makes a big difference," he says. <P>The national rise in interest rates has given many projects that were on hold initiative to get off the ground, says Sisley. He also believes a number of state programs, like empowerment zones, have made the area more attractive. Yet, with increased attention from industry and business trained upon the county, Westmoreland's shortage of developable sites has become increasingly apparent. <P>"We have more people interested than we have places to put them," says Stofan, who is hoping an upcoming renovation at the former Latrobe Diecasting Plant will partially solve that problem, at least for the central section of the county. 
<P>
<font size =+2><B>Road Trip:</B></font size>  There is more than ample land to support growth planned through the year 2015, according to a recent report by KCI Technologies, a PennDOT consultant. The trick is getting there. In Westmoreland County, crucial stretches of road are stalled in the planning stages. <P>"The only stumbling block to growth in this area remains the road system. Very simply, you can't get in and out," says Terry L. Daughenbaugh, chairman of the Transportation Committee for the Eastern Westmoreland Development Corporation. "The roads to the north and south are circuitous, twisted, two-lane highways. To the east are the Laurel Mountains, whose safety problems are well documented. To the west U.S. 30 is beginning to be congested to the point of gridlock." A trip to Pittsburgh International Airport, which now takes 87 minutes from eastern Westmoreland County, adds Daughenbaugh, is projected to take 141 minutes by 2010. <P>Many herald the Laurel Valley Expressway, a proposed 22-mile highway, as the answer to Westmoreland's transportation problems. The expressway would connect the area's air hub -- Latrobe Airport -- with its highway hub -- the New Stanton interchange of Interstate 70, the mainline Turnpike, U.S. 119 and the Amos K. Hutchinson Bypass. Current travel time from the interchange to the airport is upwards of 45 minutes, says Lynn Showalter, physical development coordinator for the Westmoreland County Industrial De-velopment Corporation. He expects travel time to be reduced to 15 minutes when the expressway is completed. <P>"Growth in the New Stanton area, especially near the Sony plant, is astounding. So the need for the Laurel Valley Expressway continues to grow," he says. <P>Larry Larese, executive director of the Westmoreland County Industrial Develop-ment Corporation, believes that 30,000 high-tech jobs can be created along the expressway corridor from the Sony plant to the county airport, but only if the road is built. A feasibility study for the new road is expected to be complete by early summer. 1998 is the earliest construction could begin. <P>Near Delmont, various sections of notoriously slow-going U.S. 22 are now being widened. When completed, the four-lane Route 22 will stretch 24 miles, from the Indiana/Westmoreland County line to the Allegheny/ West-moreland County line. Another key project coming up this year is the reconstruction of the Smithton Inter-change on U.S. 70 in South Hunting-don Township, where a 636-acre industrial park is under development. The interchange is needed to provide safe access to that park. <P>Engineering studies continue on the Kiski Valley Expressway in the northern part of the county. The project is in the preliminary engineering stage, ex-amining alternative alignments for the road. <P>"Transportation is very significant to economic development," says Sheets of New Kensington. "It's a long pro-cess that tries your patience most of the time. If you believe in the project, you have to lobby for it every chance you get." 
<P>
<font size =+2><B>Educational Outlook:</B></font size> The link between education and economic development is clear and active in Westmoreland County. The region boasts five diverse schools of higher education: Penn State New Kensington, St. Vincent College, Seton Hill College, University of Pittsburgh Greensburg and Westmoreland County Community College. <P>Rapidly changing technology has had a major impact on manufacturing industries such as those found in Westmoreland. Researchers at Penn State New Kensington proposed a Bachelor of Science degree in Electro-Mechanical Engineering Technology be offered beginning fall term 1996. The viability of offering bachelors degrees in technology management and health technology management is also being explored. <P>"Engineering technology is a high growth area in our region," says Jeffrey Arnold, director of University Relations, Penn State New Kensington. "We're working closely with people at the government level to bring the school back to the land grant purpose of the campus: to develop plans and programs that meet the needs of the community." <P>Phase I of a three phase plan to upgrade and expand campus facilities, begun in 1993, saw the completion of a new student computer center two years ago and continues this summer with the remodeling of the campus dining hall and enlargement of the kitchen. One campus classroom has been remodeled to create a multimedia classroom, offering teleconferencing capabilities among other new learning technologies. <P>Phase II, beginning July 1, includes remodeling the Advising and Counseling Center, the main entrance to the campus, the conversion of another standard classroom to a multimedia classroom, and offering a distance learning center where courses from anywhere in the Penn State system can be accessed. Additionally, the school is waiting on funding approval to begin construction on a Science and Technology Center. <P>And as of July 1, the school  has a new chief executive officer, Dr. Catherine C. Gannon, former professor of English at California State University, San Bernardino. <P>This year, Seton Hill College in Greensburg began offering a Saturday degree program that has proven extremely popular. Students can get a four-year degree by attending school year-round one day a week."For older adults already working, it's a nice way to get the degree without investing the next ten years of their lives. Many area companies are helping their employees with tuition for the program," says Linda Mitchell, director of public relations for Seton Hill. <P>"The income gap between college graduates and those holding only a high school diploma is widening in Pennsylvania," says Dr. JoAnne Boyle, president of Seton Hill, citing a recent study by the Pennsylvania College and University Research Center. At the end of the 1980s, people with advanced degrees saw their income, adjusted for inflation, rise 20% while income for those holding high school diplomas fell 13% during the decade. <P>"We knew there had been some gap, but it was a shock to see how it  had widened," says Boyle. She anticipates schools will continue to develop new ways to accommodate students' busy schedules. "It's the wave of the future for colleges." <P>Seton Hill has recently begun offering a masters degree in elementary education. Previously, teachers in the area had to drive to Pittsburgh or Indiana University of Pennsylvania for such a program. An accounting program was also started last September. <P>Westmoreland County Commu-nity College in Youngwood has also added two new programs in the past year to address changing workplace demands. An associate degree in travel and tourism has been added to the school's hospitality cluster of programs, and a commercial art and design associate degree is now part of the graphics/communications/media photography cluster of programs. WCCC works closely with the community to offer a variety of non-credit programs, such as enrichment classes in computers, languages, job skills and the arts. In February, the school began offering a non-credit truck driver training course at the request of local companies. <P>WCCC is anticipating purchasing the Pyrex Corp. building adjacent to the campus for a business and industry training center. Though the plan is not definite, the school is hoping to turn it into an incubator for small businesses.Other institutions too are taking advantage of the new economic strengths of the region. St. Vincent College in Latrobe began offering an environmental science program last year. Students choose either a science-oriented curriculum or an environmental administration program of-fered through the business department."Early signs are that this is going to be a very popular program," says Don Orlando, director of public relations at St. Vincent. The school invested $500,000 in establishing an environmental lab for the program. <P>In response to a number of requests by students and people in the surrounding community, the Univer-sity of Pittsburgh at Greensburg is now offering a bachelors degree in environmental science. In September, a communications bachelors degree, with course emphasis on speaking and interpersonal skills, will be added to the curriculum. A masters in business administration is currently under consideration as well. A preliminary survey suggests there is enough interest in the area to make the program viable, says John R. Spark, director of admissions and financial aid at Pitt-Greensburg.In May, the campus completed construction of the $8 million, 57,000-square-foot Fanny K. Millstein Library. And plans have been finalized to break ground for a $2.7 million, 102-student dormitory. Completion is expected in July 1996. 
<P> 
<font size =+2><B>Retail Tales:</B></font size>  "If you're looking for the downer in the bunch you just hit it," says Roy Houston, president of the Westmore-land Economic Development Cor-poration, of the county's retail market. Greengate Mall, located one mile west of Greensburg, has been struggling, he says, since JC Penney left last year for the greener pastures of the newly renovated Westmoreland Mall. Greengate, with about 85 stores, has not filled that space yet, and the complex is still feeling the effects of that transition.Westmoreland Mall, on the other hand, is thriving. Retail in the area is considerably better than last year, says Michael Egan, general manager of the Westmoreland Mall. In addition to gaining JC Penney, a food court and 60,000 square feet of space were added in 1994, bringing the number of retail stores in the mall to 150. <P>But downtown Greensburg struggles to keep its retail shops healthy. "I see people working together to create specialty markets," says Houston, "and I think they are, for the most part, successful. In Greensburg, the business people and others are trying to revitalize the commercial district and, frankly, it's happening. I've seen more vitality downtown recently than I've seen in years."Greensburg has benefited greatly from a number of renovation projects, such as the Palace Theater, which brings large numbers of residents downtown to eat and shop as well as to attend events. The next major renovation in the town, undertaken by the Westmoreland Trust, is the historic renovation of the downtown train station along the lines of Pittsburgh's Station Square. <P>"There are a great many stores here, yet the large majority seem to be surviving, even prospering," says Jennings F. Womack, president and CEO of Westmoreland Trust. While he says retail is as good as he's seen it in his 35 years in the business, he cautions that the market is close to saturation.

<font size =+2><B>Healthy Healthcare:</B></font size> Hospitals in Westmoreland Coun-ty continue to have significant impact on their surrounding communities. Latrobe Area Hospital in Latrobe had 1,305 full-time employees (excluding physicians) last year and paid out $54 million in salaries, benefits and specialty physician services. The facility continues its expansion and upgrades with a new addition to the maternity ward, called the Women's Suite. This area offers all private rooms for women's services, including the opportunity for women to deliver babies in their rooms in a more comfortable atmosphere than the traditional operating room.Frick Community Health Center in Mount Pleasant, employing 788 full- and part-time employees, paid out   $25 million in salaries and benefits last year. Currently the medical center has two projects under way -- a $2 million OB expansion and renovation and a   $1 million infrastructure upgrading -- and will be opening a Skilled Nursing Unit this summer. <P>In the last 14 months, Monsour Medical Center in Jeannette has doubled patient volume, added a mobile MRI service, expanded the in-patient child and psychiatry unit, physically updated its facilities and purchased a new mammography machine and special equipment for cardiac studies. Home health services have increased to include psychiatric services and physical and occupational therapy. <P>Monsour employs 325 full-time employees -- and at the end of the last fiscal year, June 30, 1994, had paid out $9.2 million in salary. <P>Another strong presence in the county's healthcare landscape is Jeannette District Memorial Hospital, which paid out $17.7 million in salary and wages to approximately 700 employees last year. In the past 12 months, the hospital has opened an 11-bed New Skills Nursing Center, the Joslin Center for Diabetes, a satellite of West Penn Hospital, and a Center for Sleep Disorders, also a satellite affiliated with West Penn. 
<P>
<font size =+2><B>Development News:</B></font size> Jobs are being created in the area, resulting from both new businesses and the expansion of existing businesses. Following is a rundown of some activities in the works: 
<DL>
<DT><DD>Sony Electronics Inc. plans to build a $300 million glassmaking facility at the East Huntingdon Township plant, where it currently assembles rear-projection televisions. The expansion will create at least 500 additional jobs at a site that will employ 1000 by the end of 1995. <P>At press time, Sony said it expects to begin building the facility in October, with glass production commencing within two years. Outside of a few top management and technical positions, most of the positions will be filled with local candidates. Hiring will begin late in 1996. <P>Volkswagen used the plant to assemble Rabbits for a decade before bailing out in 1987. When Sony announced in 1990 that it would occupy the plant, it projected an 1,800-person workforce. <P>The glass plant is a partnership be-tween Sony and Corning Asahi Video Products Co. and will be called American Video Glass Co. Sony said it needs the new plant to offset a current shortage of picture tube glass in the U.S. and to meet an expected demand explosion. Sony currently gets its picture tube glass from Corning Asahi's other plant in State College, Pa.

<B><FONT SIZE=+2><B>Banking: Your Number's Up</B></FONT></B><br>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Rising interest rates threaten an industry swelled by good times past.</B></FONT SIZE><br><i>By Richard Bierck</i>
<p>
Since the heady refinancing days of 1993, residential mortgage lending has returned to earth -- with a crash. <P> From 1991 through 1993, plummeting interest rates sent business soaring. Despite a slight decline in the first half of 1995, rates in May were still substantially higher than in the salad days of 1993. Area mortgage bankers complain that public perceptions of interest rates, tinted by doubts about rate stability, are holding buyers back despite a bountiful inventory of unsold homes.While down periods with less-than-sexy rates are hardly new to veteran companies, today's mortgage market is uncommonly crowded. For between 1990 and the first quarter of 1995, the number of first mortgage bankers licensed by the commonwealth more than doubled, as did the number of first mortgage brokers. <P> "There are too many people in the industry right now. It's the most intense I've seen it in my career," says Jack F. Karaszewski, senior vice president of PNC Mortgage, a subsidiary of PNC Bank. <P>The competition is cruel. 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Boom Babies:</B></FONT SIZE> The refinancing boom that birthed many of these companies was brought on by rates that began dropping in 1991 and hit a regional 25-year low of about 6.75% on 30-year fixed mortgages (with three points) in October 1993. <P>To the industry, such rates were nothing less than providential. Two out of 3 trillion mortgage holders nationwide raced to refinance, finding mortgage companies understaffed and backlogged as they stumbled over themselves to handle the onslaught of applications. <P> The industry expansion was as frenetic. On Dec. 31, 1990, 88 first-mortgage bankers and 277 first-mortgage brokers held licenses from the Pennsylvania Department of Banking. <P>By the end of 1993, refinancing still going like gangbusters, the numbers had increased to 142 licensed mortgage bankers and 524 brokers. Though figures specific to western Pennsylvania are not kept, anecdotal evidence suggests that the increase in licenses was at least as great in the region as it was statewide. <P> And it didn't stop there. There were still moderate increases in 1994, when the totals rose to 187 licensed mortgage bankers and 638 brokers. In the first quarter of 1995, the number of brokers increased to 663, but the number of mortgage bankers decreased by five, to 182. (These figures do not include commercial banks and thrifts, which are chartered by the federal   government.)
<P> 
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>That Was Then, This is Now:</B></FONT SIZE> Enter the Federal Reserve. Concerned that rapid economic growth would trigger inflation, the Fed elevated interest rates seven times between early 1994 and the first quarter of this year. The local result: an average rate approaching 9% in mid-December, the highest since 1990. Rates decreased somewhat this year, with the average local price of a 30-year fixed loan sliding below 8% in early May, down from 8.53% a year earlier. But the mortgage business remains a crowded forest with less game: Mortgage companies are, by necessity, leaner, hungrier and far more aggressive. <P>"There had been a tremendous growth in the industry, of mortgage brokerage firms that were thriving in the refinancing market. When that volume dissipated, you found a lot more brokers competing for the traditional mortgage business," says Jerry Tegethoff, branch manager with Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corporation. <P>Though the number of mortgage companies operating in Pennsylvania has increased since 1991, employment in the industry has been dwindling in recent months. Western Pennsylvania's mortgage industry is projected to shed 25% of its jobs. <P>"A lot of people have taken a close look at their operation and made cuts. We have made cuts. Everybody has," says Mark Steele, president of Howard Hanna Financial Services. <P>It's not as bad as it could be. Jonathan Gray, an analyst for the West Coast firm Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., has predicted that up to 40% of the nation's mortgage banking professionals will lose their jobs by late this year. 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Perception, or Reality?:</B></FONT SIZE> One obstacle that mortgage companies are seeking to overcome is what they call the "perception" of high rates. <P>"After the rate spike of early 1994, there ensued an interest rate shock that consumers perceived through the media -- I don't know how well-founded it was, but it happened just the same," says Tegethoff. <P>In late May, the best regional rates on 30-year fixed mortgages were around 7.5%, with three points. But to the chagrin of mortgage lenders and realtors, the perception of high rates has persisted despite this downtick. <P>"Consumers reach a comfort level with interest rates," says Diane Cipa, president of the Mortgage Bankers Association of Western Pennsylvania and co-owner of Family Home Mortgage in Ligonier. "They were so low for so long; folks took a step back."Howard Hanna's Steele adds: "I can tell you, having lived through 1979 to '83, that when rates jumped 18%, then back to 13%, 13% looked real good to a lot of people."To combat this perception, lenders are slicing prices. <P>"You're seeing the difference in pricing between competitors narrowing, and that's an indication that things are bottoming out," says Tegethoff. "If things get much lower, some won't be doing business at a profit at all." 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Blue Light Special:</B></FONT SIZE> Lower prices mean lower margins -- the difference between the cost of money to the mortgage originator and the borrower. <P>"When we talk about making prices competitive in this type of market, it's about narrowing down margins to an absolute minimum," says Steele. "If our margin was 1.5% two years ago, today it's a point or lower." <P> Some companies have cut their margins to the bone, originating loans at cost to stay in business while hoping for more lucrative days ahead. Says one mortgage lender: "These days, it's cutthroat." <P>In addition to slicing their margins to attract business, those who remain are offering discounts on add-ons such as appraisal fees, even advertising inducements such as airplane tickets. Some are courting realtors with a new solicitude, while others rush to strengthen existing alliances or seek formal affiliations with realty companies. <P>While maintaining a wide array of products has long been the strong suit of larger vendors like the big commercial banks, smaller companies are fast following suit. Many small concerns are expanding their offerings to include second mortgages, home-equity loans and mortgage loans at higher interest rates to borrowers who don't qualify for premium rates. <P>Mortgage companies are also seeking to qualify more applicants to make the most of their market. <P>"When we had so much refinancing and there was so much business, these folks probably would have been turned away," says Cipa. "But now [companies] are trying to qualify everybody." <P>Integra Mortgage Co. is even counseling applicants who don't qualify, to help them become eligible next time around. <P>"The idea is that if they don't qualify for a mortgage at this moment and they reorganize [their personal financial situations], maybe they'll qualify six months to a year later," says Tom Finnegan, Integra Mortgage's executive vice president. "We don't have a 100% batting average, of course. It's not just an income-level thing, but management of finances, keeping installment debt down and learning to save." 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Alphabet Soup:</B></FONT SIZE> For some companies, qualifying as many borrowers as possible has meant offering high-rate mortgage loans -- known as "B," "C" and "D" paper -- to applicants who don't qualify for the standard-rate mortgages, known as "A" paper. ("A" paper mortgages are those underwritten according to the tougher standards of the Federal National Mortgage Association, known as "Fannie Mae," or the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, referred to as "Freddie Mac." These institutions purchase loans made to these standards, returning money to the market and thus permitting lenders to make more loans.)As the "A" paper market has declined, lenders, seeking new avenues of business, have been more motivated to assess risks and offset them with higher rates. Last spring, companies offering fixed rates of about 7.8% on "A" loans offered "B" paper for 11.25%, "C" paper for 12.25% and a "D" loan for 13.25%. <P>"Ten years ago, there were very few people doing this type of lending, particularly in this market," says Steele. "The West Coast has been doing it for a longer time; they are the avant-garde of lending." <P>Two payments 60 days late and one 30 days late can put a borrower in the "B" category. "C" paper loans often involve a debt-to-income ratio of 55%, or a history of multiple late payments of 90 days or more. "D" paper means customers have filed for bankruptcy. <P>As for the increased risk, Tegethoff of Chase Manhattan Mortgage, which has been handling these loans since early 1994, quotes San Francisco-based Wells Fargo Bank, one of the pioneers of "B" and "C" paper: "They say, Risk has its rewards.' <P>"Bad things happen to good people. You could have a retired steelworker who owes nothing on his home, but for one reason or another didn't pay his taxes, and the liens make him a B' or C' instead of an A,' " says Tegethoff. <P>Usually, qualified applicants for "B" and "C" paper can reorganize their finances and qualify for "A" loans a year or more later. "B" and "C" products are designed to provide a mortgage for borrowers who, for whatever reason, cannot wait. After these borrowers make timely payments on such loans for a year, their mortgage companies often refinance them into an "A" loan. 
<P> 
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Are You Being Served?:</B></FONT SIZE> Borrowers in a slackened market have the leeway to shop for service as well as price, so mortgage companies compete closely on the speed of approvals. <P>Some lenders will approve loans over the telephone, with the condition that the buyer find a home within seven days and the oral statements are verified. <P>Other programs give buyers a financing commitment within a week if they bring required documentation to a pre-qualifying interview, allowing them to close on a house in as little as two weeks. <P>In 1993, this option wasn't available. For one thing, there was a backlog. <P>"An appraisal was taking us three to four weeks and a credit report, about two weeks," says Steele. <P> In addition to speedier service, some home mortgage vendors are offering discounts. Some companies, such as Dellwood Mortgage Co., have offered discount title insurance."This has cost us money, but because the borrowers benefit, the realtor gets a happier client, and the realtors then, hopefully, bring us more business," says Kevin Laird, Dellwood vice president. <P>Conversely, some mortgage banking concerns that own title insurance companies as controlled businesses have underwritten mortgages more or less at cost to get the insurance business -- anything to pinpoint potential customers in a slow market. <P>Mortgage lenders' access to business is "diminishing as realtors form their own mortgage companies," says PNC's Karaszewski. "Everybody is looking at their sourcing." According to Karaszewski, PNC Mortgage is setting up a joint venture with Coldwell Banker that is expected to be in force later this year. <P>This alliance is being formed to take on the likes of Howard Hanna Financial Services, a subsidiary of the same holding company that owns Howard Hanna Real Estate Services. Howard Hanna Real Estate has the largest market share in Pittsburgh, and Howard Hanna Financial is the largest mortgage banking entity in western Pennsylvania not owned by a bank or thrift. <P>Mortgage lenders who don't have such arrangements with real estate companies have sought to have them tightly regulated. Last year, in response to lobbying from the National Association of Mortgage Brokers, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development proposed regulations prohibiting real estate companies from paying their employees for referrals to their own mortgage banking firms. The proposal died a tacit  administrative death. <P>In Pennsylvania, mortgage banking interests have lobbied the state legislature to impose a requirement that such controlled companies be required to do at least 51% of their business on properties not handled by their affiliated realty companies. <P>Rep. Victor Lescovitz, a Democrat on the state House of Representatives' Commerce and Economic Develop-ment Committee, said last spring that he had considered including the measure in a broader bill to be introduced this summer. Afraid of muddying the waters for the bill's other elements, he decided against including it. <P>"It's an issue we're not going to resolve," says Lescovitz, who represents Washington and Beaver counties' 46th state House district. <P>A governmental issue that weighs more heavily on mortgage minds is the idea of dismantling the Federal Housing Administration, because of criticism that it drains tax revenues and contributes to the nation's budget deficit. As the FHA is a key underwriter of mortgage insurance for low- and moderate-income home buyers, its dissolution would mean tougher credit criteria and an even tighter market. <P> Opponents of the FHA have suggested that a private agency could replace it, but Karaszewski is skeptical: "We're not sure the private sector can take the place of what the FHA has done." <P> With or without the FHA, some believe the industry is entering a new era. They say the slackening of the market, combined with the multiplicity     of players, is creating fundamental change. There are predictions that the mortgage industry is moving toward a supermarket concept where companies, accepting the competitive reality of lower margins, will set up for higher volume and Spartan cost containment. They see the expected role of computers in helping borrowers access lenders from their homes as fitting into this high-volume scenario. <P>Others believe that the current market is a blip on the screen, and that the industry will return to margins which, though perhaps not as profitable as those of the early 1990s, are better than today's.One thing is clear. An economic Darwinism has hold of the market, and only the strong, the innovative and the lucky will survive.

<FONT SIZE=+3><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="../pictures/publisher.gif"> </FONT SIZE><FONT SIZE=+2>Change is in the Air</FONT SIZE><i> By Linda A. Dickerson</i>
<P>
Smart organizations today must be chameleon-like, adapting their ways to the circumstances which surround them. This magazine is no exception. <P> Executive Report is pleased to announce the appointment of a new editorial team. Just as we went to press with this issue, Jim Urban became the magazine's new editor-in-chief, and Lydia Strohl the magazine's executive life editor. <P> Jim Urban, a powerhouse editor/ writer, cut his teeth at some of the choicest outlets in town -- from UPI to the Tribune Review to the Associated Press. Under Jim's capable leadership, the magazine will strive to provide the in-depth, analytical, business coverage that is its market niche. Jim's savvy instincts will bring readers incisive information to help them improve their businesses. <P> "Executive Report will be hard-hitting and forward thinking," said Jim recently. "I want our readers to look forward to getting it every month." <P> Working in tandem with Jim, Lydia Strohl will spark a human interest dimension in the magazine. Lydia has freelanced for many  local publications and is the Pittsburgh correspondent for Money magazine, but Executive Report readers know her best as  our healthcare reporter of many years. Her life has taken her from Athens, Greece to Tokyo, Japan and back again to Pittsburgh, and with that international perspective, Lydia will broaden our horizons and inject the magazine with a kaleidoscope of opinions. <P> "There are just as many perspectives on business as there are people, " she said to me yesterday. "We need to bring them onto our pages." <P> I am eager to work with our new dynamic duo. Executive Report, under Lydia and Jim's leadership, will provide its readers with the provocative information they need to challenge the status quo in their own thinking, in their own operations and in their own communities. So breathe deeply, Pittsburgh. Change is in the air.

Your article "Why Johnny Can't Work" in the April issue was right on target. The future of our state and our country is related closely to the work we do in reforming education. <P> Under the Goals 2000: Educate America federal legislation, Pennsyl-vania 2000 (which Governor Ridge and I co-chair) has been selected as the "State Improvement Panel" to develop a "State Improvement Plan" for K-12 education in this state.  <P> Now is the time for all educators, businesses, unions, foundations and others to join with us and make their voices heard. <BR>-- Edward Donley, former chairman, Air Products & Chemicals, Inc., Allentown, Pa.

<font size =+2><B>Welcome To Cyberspace</B></font size><BR>
Imagine my surprise and delight to see Pittsburgh so wonderfully represented on the 'net. <P> I lived in Pittsburgh for over 20 years. It was a sad moment when I had to leave. The corporate tax structure stifled my fledgling PC-based software support and development company just on the verge of knocking the socks off the mainframe-entrenched corporations in Pittsburgh. <P> Your recent article on the strikes and Pennsylvania tax structure ("Opportunities Lost," February 1995) said it all. The corporation I work for is looking to buy a financial-based company.  But despite my praise for the city of Pittsburgh and its people, they will not consider any place in Pennsylvania as suitable. After all, I now live in a state that functions fairly well without a state personal income tax. <P> One day ... like so many other homesick Pittsburghers I find on the 'net ... one day, we may find employment and career opportunities once again in Pittsburgh.<BR>-- Beverly Freed, Computer Language Research, Dallas, Tx. bfreed@fasttax.com

The May 1995 issue of Executive Report incorrectly listed Blair Corporation's total dividend payments for calendar 1994 ("The Pennsylvania 100," page 19). The correct figure would have been $2.05 vs. the $1.40 figure used. Please note, too, that our actual dividend total for 1994 would have merited our inclusion in your Top 10 in Dividends listing (page 16).

I am extremely distressed by the blatant omission of Ladbroke Racing Pennsylvania in the "Economic Devel-opment Profile: Washington County" feature (April 1995). Ladbroke Racing Pennsylvania is headquartered out of Meadow Lands, Pa. (Washington County). We own and operate Ladbroke at The Meadows and five state-of-the-art off-track wagering and dining facilities in New Castle, Greensburg, Harmar Township, Johns-town and Moon Township. We had a record year in "handle" (monies wagered or sales) in 1994 with over $300 million being wagered at our facilities. We attracted 1.3 million patrons in 1994 (more than the Pittsburgh Pirates). We directly employ 900 to 1,000 people (500 just at The Meadows) and have a payroll over    $11 million. Bottom line ... our success story began and continues to emulate from Washington County.

<!IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="GuestEditor.gif"> <FONT SIZE=+2><B>Innovative Small Banks Can Survive The Consolidation Wave</B></FONT SIZE><br><i>By Thomas J. O'Shane</i><P>
Innovative small banks can survive the consolidation wave.By Thomas J. O'ShaneOnly the strong will survive. That refrain has long been the law of the jungle and is quickly becoming the law of the banking industry. <P> Indications are that banking is strong. In the last three years, industry-wide earnings were remarkable. <P> But the brightness of the numbers may blind us to the facts. We cannot rest on our laurels: The remainder of the 1990s will bring unprecedented chal-lenges -- particularly for small banks. <P> Firstly, increased competition will escalate the need for change. In the not-too-distant past, banks competed against other banks and with savings and loans. Today, they compete against finance companies, mortgage companies, investment bankers and even auto-mobile and machinery companies --competitors typically facing far less regulation than banks. <P> Also, with advances in technology, banks are not just competing with local rivals, but with national and international competitors. So the challenge to keep customers is greater than ever -- particularly for small banks that may not have access to the latest technology. <P> The level of government regulation also drags on banks' competitiveness. Our company is examined on a regular basis by five different regulatory bodies, some of which duplicate services. These exams consume valuable employee and management time. <P> Further, government regulations prevent banks from marketing the same financial services that other institutions provide. For example, banks are prevented from directly providing investments, so we must do it through a third party to meet customer demand. <P>With increased competition and regulation, it is no wonder that a wave of consolidations has sharply reduced the number of banks operating in the United States. The FDIC counts less than 10,000 banks today, compared to nearly 14,500 in 1982. <P> What will it take for small banks to survive and grow as these difficult conditions continue? <P> Small banks must demonstrate the marketing savvy of big banks while capitalizing on their traditional strength -- friendly service. <P> Small banks need to respond quickly to demand for attractively priced, efficiently delivered services. Debit cards, affinity credit cards, indirect auto loans, loans by phone, touch-tone automated account access, mobile loan originators -- larger banks have led the consumer to expect them. <P> But banking customers also want the personal touch smaller banks provide. And they want to bank in their neighborhoods, where many small banks have built solid reputations over decades. Banks that can deliver this kind of service have a strong distinction from the standardization for which larger banks have been criticized. <P> In spite of the challenges facing banks in this decade, U.S. banks still are the number one supplier of credit to this country. Holding that position means committing to the path that promises success in exchange for a willingness to change. <P> Only small banks that distinguish themselves with innovation and first-rate service will survive. <P> Thomas J. O'Shane is president and CEO of First Western Bancorp, a bank-holding company based in New Castle, Pa.

<h2>PHIL SCHALTENBRAND</h2>
Ever purchased a piece of souvenir pottery -- the traditional, gray and blue colonial pottery, embossed with the name of the town you're visiting? <P> It might read Old Sturbridge Village, Cape Cod, Kennebunkport, Maine, or even San Francisco, but turn it over. Chances are it's stamped "Made in Pennsylvania," and was made just south of Pittsburgh, at Westerwald Pottery in Scenery Hill. <P> Almost 20 years ago, public school art teacher Phil Schaltenbrand discovered he was making something people wanted -- hand-thrown stoneware, reminiscent of 19th century colonial pottery. <P> "It was right around the bicentennial, and I realized I had something that really appealed. It started as a spin-off business, and it just kept escalating," says Schaltenbrand. <P> Today, his company, Westerwald Pottery, ships 150,000 pieces annually, 95% of them with hand-lettering. Schaltenbrand projects 1995 sales will reach $1.5 million to $2 million. Eighty-five percent of the pieces go to towns across the country, predominantly in the east; 8% to 10% are custom decorated for companies like H.J. Heinz and American Standard, and the other 5% of business is done from the retail showroom at Westerwald Pottery, on scenic Route 40. <P> Westerwald has 30 employees, who make everything from traditional functional pieces like pitchers and pots to more modern creations such as lamps and chip'n dip platters, all in Westerwald's signature blue and gray stoneware. Stamped with a potter's mark, signed and dated, each individual piece undergoes a minimum of 12 separate hands-on processes. Wheel-thrown, brush-decorated and kiln-fired, pieces are originals and meant    to be used. In fact, Schaltenbrand suggests the pottery be passed on to future generations. <P> "There's no substitute for hand work," says Schaltenbrand, who has authored two books about pottery: "Old Pots: Salt Glazed Stoneware of the Greensboro-New Geneva Region," published in 1979, and "Stoneware of Southwestern Pennsylvania," which will be published in the fall by the University of Pittsburgh Press. "With the Made in Pennsylvania' stamp embedded in each piece, people can do a history of our pottery 100 years from now."	-Dorothy Yagodich

<FONT SIZE=+1><b>Once Upon a Suburb:</B> </FONT> <BR>The Stone Mansion Offers Innovative Cuisine And An Extraordinary Wine List.<BR>
<i>By Lydia Strohl</i>
<HR>
Owner Don Mervis, former manager of Rico's, has remodeled and reopened the former Gryphon, in Wexford, as the Stone Mansion. He types his offerings as "continental." <P> "I wanted to do something different. My criteria to Michel [Wetli, executive chef] was I don't care what you put on the menu, but it has to be delicious,' " says Mervis. "In this business, you're only as good as your last dinner." <P> The building itself is a 1930s mansion, built by former Allegheny County sheriff Robert Woodside. A stained glass window graces the wooden staircase, which leads down to a kaleidoscope of dining rooms and retains the wandering feeling of an old home. <P> Disappointingly, though, the main dining room is sterile, with a dropped ceiling and a view of the air treatment system. But we had a small corner table, perfectly proportioned to the chairs, promoting maximum coziness. Dining al fresco, which Mervis has planned for the summer, will be a welcome alternative. <P> It is the food that really commands your attention here. The menu is well-balanced, with something for all palates. The wine list -- 120 selections, ranging from benign to adventuresome, with prices to match -- is one of the most exciting in the region. <P> Among the more interesting appetizers was a duck strudel, offset by a common fried zucchini. Sea scallops Gorgonzola was perfectly cooked and complemented by a rich creamy sauce. Wild mushrooms grigliare are marinated in a smooth, herby vinaigrette. The temperature (cold) was unexpected, but they were tasty. A pile of domestic mushrooms garnished the plate, making the helping large. <P> A house salad comes with the meal, or you can choose a more exotic offering (Caesar, mozzarella, even caponata). The house salad was over-dressed, and though the salad of hearts of palm and artichoke was wonderful, beware, for the waiters did not inform us there were no substitutions, and that added $6.25 to the bill. <P> For the entree special, Wetli, former chef at Disney World, offered parrot fish, which was cooked til moist and flaky and served on a bed of lobster cream sauce. Though the sauce was rich, it was tomato based and served under the fish, so it didn't physically or otherwise smother the wonderful flavor of the fillet. A bed of saffron and green peppercorn couscous was the perfect complement. <P> The continental menu has a wide range of meats, poultry, fish and pasta, even a grilled vegetable entree. The lamb chops montglas are to be raved about -- a thick double chop, broiled to perfection and served with a simple, rich reduction. But other diners reported lesser experiences with pastas and fish off the regular menu. <P> Mervis acknowledges the challenge in presenting elegant hand-cooked meals consistently in a restaurant with a 220 seating capacity, but says he's beginning to be satisfied."It's been a rocky road," he says. "If I was where I am today when we opened [in November], I would have unbelievable results right now." <P> Mervis is working diligently on the consistency and the menu (this is the fifth draft). To say the service is attentive would be an understatement. Upon our arrival, four valet parkers leaped from a small shed and whisked the car away. The wait staff have been trained by the same hand. Luckily, they are more like eager young boys than haughty purveyors of haute cuisine. <P> The prices are steep for this market, so those wanting a sure bet should wait a few months before venturing to the Stone Mansion. But, if consistency can be maintained, and the decor rendered a little more unique, the potential is clearly there for greatness.

<I>ER Index is compiled by Doug Thomas, vice president and director of research at the HomeState Pennsylvania Growth Fund in Lancaster.</I>
<HR>
<H2>S&P 500 Continues to Outpace Local Stocks</h2><P>
Sometimes good just isn't good enough. Such continues to be the case for our basket of local stocks, which inched up 0.68% for the month ended May 12. But the ER Index's continuing positive returns, a cumulative 10.94% increase since inception, are lagging behind the runaway and more heavily technology laden S&P 500, which for the same periods increased 3.78% and 13.95% respectively. 
<P> 
The less than a percentage gain in the ER Index last month masked several strong individual issues, including Kennametal, which jumped 19.65% to 28 5/8 following the announcement of a 95% increase in fiscal third quarter EPS to 84 cents per share. Kennametal shares have risen nearly a third since last August. The strong gains are due to growing domestic and international demand for the company's metalworking products, as well as strong productivity gains. Perhaps most impressive is the showing of Hertel, its German subsidiary, which was acquired just last year. For the quarter, Hertel contributed 14 cents per share in earnings, vs. a loss of 2 cents last year. Quite a turnaround. 
<P> 
<DL>
<LI>Alcoa gained 11.34% last month, to 46 5/8. Aluminum companies such as Alcoa have benefited from increased demand and profitability. Chairman Paul O'Neill expects higher profits as Alcoa continues to experience increasing consumption, higher pricing and falling inventory levels. 
<LI> Legent reported fiscal second quarter EPS of 43 cents per share, falling short of Wall Street's expected 50 cents per share. However, Legent's share price gained 6.14% for the month to 30 1/4 as investors focused on the company's strategic shift toward client-server based computer software products. As we went to press, Legent was bought out by Computer Associates, but the closing price is not reflective of the closing acquisition price, which was 47.85 per share. 
<P> 
The Index also had its share of dogs for the month, three in particular. 
<LI>American Eagle Outfitters posted this month's largest decline as the company's shares fell 25.88% to 15 3/4. In early May the company revealed that it had incurred additional expenses from its rapid expansion from 176 to 274 stores this year, as well as higher than expected inventory shrinkage, the retail industry's term for stolen goods, which will significantly affect bottom line results. 
<LI>FORE Systems fell victim to profit-taking this month, declining 18.96% to 33 5/8 after announcing financial re-sults exceeding analysts' estimates. For fiscal year ended March 31, 1995, FORE's profits rose 300% to 27 cents per share on a 235% increase in sales to $75.6 million. 
<LI>MK Rail slumped amid growing realization that its troubles and those at its parent, Morrison Knudsen, were both worse than believed. MK Rail's stock fell more than 23% to 7 for the month, as the company continued to delay the release of its 1994 fourth quarter and 1995 first quarter results. Losses may include overruns for locomotive remanufacturing contracts and troubles at its Argen-tinian joint venture and its Australian operations. <P>Five companies on our list recently announced earnings that put a smile on investors' faces. 
<DL>
<LI>Astrotech International reported its fiscal second quarter EPS improved to  5 cents per share versus a 2 cent loss   last year, on an 82% rise in revenues to $28 million. 
<LI>Black Box Corp. reported record revenues and earnings for its fiscal year ended March 31, 1995. The company's EPS rose 25% to 89 cents on a 16% sales gain to $164.8 million. 
<LI>Railcar maker Johnstown America got back on track in the first quarter, reporting a 94% increase in earnings to 31 cents per share on a 91% sales gain to $178 million. Johnstown America finished off 1.02% to 12 1/8 for the month. 
<LI>Mylan Labs reported superb fiscal year end results for the period ended March 31, 1995. Net income increased 65% to $120.9 million, or $1.52 on a 57% increase in revenue to $396.1 million, as compared to revenues of  $251.8 million and net income of  $73.1 million, or 93 cents per share. Mylan finished off 7.14% for the month to 29 1/4. Since August, however, Mylan has risen more than 23%. 
<LI>PPG Industries announced an increase in first quarter earnings of 60% on an 18% increase in revenues to $1.74 billion.

<H2>Respironics' Meteny Takes a Deep Breath</h2>
Nobody needs to remind Dennis Meteny that bad things come in threes, as in Barron's, Investors Business Daily and The New York Times. Recently, each of them has taken a shot at his company, Murrysville-based Respironics, innovative maker of respiratory therapy equipment used primarily by patients with sleeping and breathing disorders. <P> The articles raised questions about Respironics' pricing, competition and insider selling. They also cast doubts about the company's credibility and integrity in light of a warning letter from the Food & Drug Administration last December regarding several areas of disagreement. The Times, for instance, insinuated that Respironics was receiving special treatment because its chairman, Gerald McGinnis, had a private meeting with Newt Gingrich. McGinnis is a charter member of Gopac, Gingrich's political action committee. <P> The Times also accused Respiron-ics of ignoring the FDA and acting illegally. Specifically, the Times says Respir-onics should have quit shipping those products addressed in the warning letter. <P> Well, I have read the letter carefully, and couldn't disagree more. Further, I have met few people with higher ethical standards than either Dennis Meteny or Gerald McGinnis. Meteny had been the company's chief financial officer until last November, when he was named     to succeed McGinnis. What an initiation it has been --  as if competititors like HealthDyne, Puritan-Bennett and Sunrise Medical aren't tough enough. <P> I don't believe it a coincidence that Respironics' short sellers -- investors who bet a stock will fall by selling borrowed shares in hopes of buying them back later at a cheaper price -- currently control more than 2.6 million of the company's nearly 17.7 million shares outstanding. How else can you explain all the negative public sentiment? Were the stories planted by some shrewd shorts? I don't know. <P> What I do know is that at this price, 13 1/2, Respironics is selling for less than 17x expected earnings for its next fiscal year (June 1996). The company has plenty of cash, virtually no debt and superb margins. I know management has consistently met or exceeded estimates. I also know the company is an attractive acquisition candidate. With all that said, it probably won't surprise anybody that Dennis Meteny seems little concerned with short sellers or rumors. In a recent meeting with institutional investors and analysts, he was low-key, confident and upbeat. What was he doing about this ruckus? Just concentrating, he said, on running the business-- the stock price will take care of itself.-- D.T.

When the Lawrenceville Development Corporation approached Charles L. Desmone and Associates to assess their interest in the Pennsylvania National Bank Building, the keystone of Lawrenceville's central Doughboy Square, a package deal was not what they had in mind. <P> But like today's celebrities that produce, direct and star in their own movies, the local architecture firm saw the proposition as more than just relief to their tight quarters in a former Point Breeze beer distributorship. They took on the project not only as tenants but also as architects and part owners. <P> "It was pretty trashed," says Chip Desmone, project manager. "It had been abandoned for 12 years. Most of the windows were boarded up and there was a lot of water infiltration. There were a couple of thousand pigeons living here, so we had to do toxic waste remediation before we even started." <P> The building cost the partnership (formed by Desmone and Associates and the Lawrenceville Development Corporation) $130,000, and another $800,000 was raised to finance the renovations, which were done with such integrity that the firm was awarded the Pittsburgh Historic Review Commission's 1995 Historic Review Commission Preservation Week Award for its rehabilitation. <P> One of the last times that the building was recognized by the city was in 1980, when the area was declared "slum and blight." Lawrenceville has turned a new page since then."It really did help get development going," says Desmone, referencing an adjacent townhouse project, the NASA Robotics Consor-tium and a strip mall, all in differing stages of development in Lawrenceville. "Not a lot of people know about over here -- they tend to focus on the South Side." <P> Obviously, some people have noticed. The project also received a 1995 Historic Preservation Construction Award from the Pennsylvania Historical Museum Commission and a 1994 Honor Award from the AIA Pittsburgh Chapter.

The Wild Blue YonderAccording to the Tourism Works for America Report, travel and tourism is a $416 billion industry -- the largest U.S. services export industry. Figures for 1994 show that international travel-related spending within the U.S. was $75 billion. <P> Here in Allegheny County, that industry brings in $1.07 billion annually, according to Marla Meyer, director of communications at the Pittsburgh Convention and Visitors Bureau. "If you took [the revenue] from just meetings and conventions like it was one private company, it would be the eighth largest in the region," says Meyer. "3.6 million people come to Pittsburgh each year." <P> Nationally, the travel sector is the second largest employer, directly employing 5.2 million in 1993, and indirectly employing 5.4 million in that same year. In Allegheny County, 42,000 are employed in tourism -- 12,000 of those by USAir -- making it one of our top industry segments, following manufacturing, healthcare and government.

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Small Businesses Make Big Gains in Employment </B></FONT SIZE><br>
Small businesses continue to take giant strides in creating new jobs for America's workers. <P> Approximately 50% of the estimated 3 million jobs to be created in 1995 will be attributed to small businesses with less than 20 employees, according to the Dun & Bradstreet Corp. annual Dun's 5,000 Survey of Employment Expectations. The surveys are based on a sample of 5,000 U.S. firms and are statistically representative of the distribution of firms by size and industry in the U.S. economy. <P> "Smaller and typically younger firms are taking advantage of the current economic strength to grow. In addition, fewer large firms plan for work force reductions; the downsizing trend has slowed and many are beginning to hire again," says Douglas Handler, manager of econometric analysis for Dun & Bradstreet. "Despite these improvements, it should be noted that these larger firms will still account for only 6% of all new jobs during 1995. Job levels seem to have stabilized, but executives predict slow growth at best." <P> Retail and service sectors exhibit the strongest expectations for job creation during 1995. Of the service sector executives surveyed, 27% said they will increase staffing levels, accounting for 35% of expected job creation during 1995. The hiring increases anticipated by 32% of retailers surveyed make up a total of 25% of all expected new jobs.

In the Netherlands, 50% of the people employed in the horticultural industry are handicapped. That's what Parkman Clancy, a retired Pittsburgh businessman, and his friends learned when exploring Clancy's idea of founding a not-for-profit that would train mentally handicapped persons for horticultural careers. <P> Presuming the concept could also work here, they formed the not-for-profit Controlled Environment Horticulture Inc. <P> "[Horticulture] is a very therapeutic environment with low stress," says George Jones, executive director. "And these tasks can be successfully accomplished by a wide variety of people. The [mentally] disabled are being asked to take a greater part in their own lives and this would allow them jobs." <P> Last fall, the group acquired a farm market and greenhouse in Franklin Park called Brookside Nursery, where 30 people are employed -- about half of them with disabilities. According to Jones, the venture is blossoming."On a scale of 10, I would give [the employees] a 9. I think the reason that I wouldn't say 10 is because they haven't worked for a period of time," says Jones. <P> But he hopes to change that: The group plans to expand the nursery into a year-round operation and set up a training facility that will perhaps even be accredited through community college. "In Maryland, the American Horticulture Assembly uses this therapeutic aspect to encourage [handicapped] employment -- and thousands of people have been placed."

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>International Investing: Rationale for a Modern World</B> </FONT SIZE> <BR>
<i> By Henry a. Frantzen</i>, executive vice president and head of global investing for Federated Investors
<p>
Twenty-five years ago, the financial news on any given day ran down the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the transportation index and the blue chip issues on the New York Stock Exchange. <P> Today, we also learn whether the Nikkei Index is up, Hong Kong is off or Australia is even; what stocks did on the London and Paris exchanges, and what the dollar is doing against the yen and the deutschemark.The difference makes absolute sense, considering that in 1970, stocks issued by companies in the United States represented 70% of all the stocks in the world. Today, that ratio is reversed -- about 70% of the world's stocks are issued outside the United States. <P> In other words, the field of play in the investment game is global. Only an investor with the courage of a mountain lion would sink everything into one stock. And today, restricting investment to one regional economy creates much the same vulnerability. <P> In 1970, most people in this country had a car, television, radio and camera, all made in the United States. No one had ever heard of Club Med or Perrier Water. <P>Today, of the four major companies that produce the tires we drive on (Bridgestone, Goodyear, Michelin and Perelli), only one is a U.S. company. <P> Having an international component to an investment portfolio is one way to enjoy the fruits of our international consumption. <P> This is not a new concept. The pros started doing it about 20 years ago, and their exposure to international securities has grown measurably ever since. <P>The object of the investment game is to end up with more money than you started with. And a comparison of growth over 10-year periods for major categories of investments -- stocks, bonds, Treasury bills, collectable art, etc. -- shows that international securities are one of the fastest growing categories over the long term. <P>For example, the 1980s were a decade of remarkable growth for U.S. stocks, which rose an average of 17.4% per year. But international stocks grew 22.3% in the same period. <P>Don't be lulled into thinking anything is a sure bet. In fact, returns from international securities don't always outpace U.S. investments. <P> But over the long term, the international sector of the investment landscape is difficult to ignore, considering events of the last quarter century. <P>After two consecutive years of economic expansion, the U.S. economy may now be in a period of transition, heading toward a period of slower growth, or perhaps recession. Europe, by contrast, has just emerged from recession and seems to be returning to traditional rates of economic growth. Japan is now emerging from recession. <P>These differences provide opportunities for investors. Just turn on the financial news some time and listen.

<img align=left hspace=5 src="0695.Feature.1.0.gif"><font size =+2><B>1994 Executive Report/Price Waterhouse Best Deal Awards </B></font size> <p>

Each year, the Best Deal Awards celebrate leadership in business, economic development and community service: leadership distinguished by singularity of achievement and potential for prosperity.<P>
For the fifth annual Best Deal Awards, a panel of dissenting judges and the sponsors, Executive Report and Price Waterhouse LLP, considered numerous nominations.<P>
Executive Report sought nominations by placing an advertisement in the magazine and mass-mailing letters and forms to business and community leaders. Judges voted on nominees via written ballots, using a point system. The votes were then tabulated and assigned to categories by Price Waterhouse.<P>

<b>Quality Is Everything<BR></b><p>
<img align=left hspace=5 src="0695.Feature.1.1.gif">
For years, large manufacturing companies have established and nurtured their own mini-universities to improve suppliers' products by enhancing their quality management skills.<P>
Some of these large manufacturers have made their educational offerings more accessible around the country through the National Consortium for Supplier Training, which enables managers of smaller companies to receive training locally.<p>
The management prowess of some of the nation's most prestigious companies is now available in the form of short courses through the newly established Pittsburgh Supplier Training Center (STC).<P>
It all started in April 1994, when a group of business leaders began working together to develop a means of providing the area's base of midsize companies with quality management instruction.<P>
The product of these efforts, the Pittsburgh STC, has been accepted as a member of the National Consortium for Supplier Training. The local center will teach courses, which are the property of the National Consortium, at the center's headquarters at the Connelly Center of Duquesne University's School of Business. Some courses will be taught at company locations.<P>
"We could have 20 courses by the fall," says Barry Maciak, director of the Connelly Center. Maciak, who is also director of the Pittsburgh STC, says the center's program will begin before then with four courses.<P>
Maciak views the local availability of these quality management programs as an opportunity "primarily for companies trying to change their management style by working toward total quality management: producing the highest quality product at the most affordable cost exactly when the company needs it by empowering the work force to identify and solve problems, reduce waste and improve efficiency."<p>
The local availability of the courses will make them not only more accessible geographically but also financially. "If you went to, say, Eastman Kodak Co. for a course, you might pay $550. The same course [taught in Pittsburgh] through the consortium would be only about $150," says Jay Duffy, manager of training and development for Bayer Inc., the center's primary sponsor.<P>
A key distinction of the Pittsburgh center is the multiplicity of sponsor companies - a total of 11 - compared with other consortium training sites around the country, most of which have one or two sponsors.<P>
"This is a relatively new model for supplier training centers around the country, and the team of sponsors is growing," Duffy says. "We hope to add five to 10 more. The fact that we have so many major local companies involved means a tremendous number of suppliers will benefit because their customers will ask them to take advantage of these courses."
<P>
<b>Acquiring Tradition<BR></b>
When executives of Federated Department Stores Inc. were negotiating for the acquisition of Joseph Horne Co. Inc. by the Lazarus chain, they were aware they were dealing with a venerable Pittsburgh retailing institution.<P>
With 145 years in Pittsburgh, the eight Horne's stores were as much a part of the Iron City as the Mount Washington inclines or the Smithfield Street Bridge.<p>
Sensing Horne's desire not to turn its back on Pittsburgh, Federated knew its acquisition-by-merger offer was being judged on far more than the face value of $123 million in cash and notes.<P>
"Other companies were interested in the acquisition," says Jerry Gafford, Lazarus' senior vice president of corporate affairs. "I can't tell you unequivocally that ours was the best deal."<P>
Financially, that is. But, Gafford adds, Lazarus was willing to give more than money.<p>
"It was not just a willingness to pay x' number of dollars, but a concern for associates and customers. They wanted people who would do the right thing, and we have a great history of corporate citizenship," says Gafford.<P>
Federated completed the acquisition of the Pittsburgh stores and two Horne's locations in Erie in May without imme-diate layoffs.<P>
"We weren't going to transfer [employees] around. We didn't want to do that," says Gafford.<P>
Mike Trafford, regional vice president for Lazarus, said that Pittsburgh was a natural place for Federated to set up shop.<P>
"For one thing, there wasn't a Federated retailer in Pittsburgh," he says. "For another, Pittsburgh was a natural geographic location [for Cincinnati-based Federated] because of its stores in the region." Federated has stores in neighboring West Virginia and Ohio.<P>
Despite this, Gafford adds, "coming to Pittsburgh gave us pause. It would be as if someone came into Ohio to change the Lazarus name. So we obviously have a challenge in overcoming that obstacle for several years to come. It will take us a couple of years to do the kinds of things we need to do in Pittsburgh - to show we're here for the long term."<P>
One of those things is something Horne's couldn't afford: remodeling the stores. Lazarus' $85 million remodeling plan, including virtual remakes of locations in Monroeville and suburban Pittsburgh's South Hills, got under way from the outset.<p>
"We decided to defer some of the grand opening hype until we open the South Hills [store] in October," says Trafford. The Monroeville store is to open in March 1996. "We didn't want a major grand opening because we're still putting our stamp on Pittsburgh."<P>
Nevertheless, Lazarus' arrival in Pittsburgh was obvious to all but ostriches, as the company advertised heavily in an autumn campaign that melded into Christmas season blitz.<P>
Gafford says the advertising budget was nothing out of the ordinary for an acquisition, though it was "a little larger at Christmas than the norm."
<P>
<b>Industry Goes Rural<BR></b>
In the mid-1980s, there lay in Washington County 600 acres of state-owned property not unlike much of the rolling land that abounds in southwestern Pennsylvania.<p>
Its raw beauty carried a downside for development, as it was unserved by utilities and roads. Yet the parcel's proximity to I-79 - it was contiguous to the interstate's right-of-way - offered enormous development potential, assuming the construction of an interchange nearby.<P>
The interchange has since been built. The land was purchased by Washington County for $706,710 and turned over to the county's redevel-opment authority in 1985.<P>
What were once farm pastures are now golf course fairways. And the previ-ously inaccessible property in unassum-ing Cecil Township is now the address of some big corporate names, employers of more than 700 people. Some upscale housing has also been built.<P>
Rod L. Piatt, president of Millcraft Investments Inc., Southpointe's marketing agent, says it's the first development in the tristate area to combine light industrial, recreational and residential uses. He remembers some skepticism that the local market would tolerate the concept.<P>
Yet the faith of Millcraft and Washington County officials in the project was well invested. By the end of 1994, six industrial clients had purchased sites from the county and built plants ranging from Digital Concepts' $1.3 million investment in 21,000 square feet to AEG Automation's $19 million stake in 220,000 square feet.<p>
The first corporate resident at Southpointe was Accutrex Products' headquarters, encompassing 66,000 square feet. Neighboring structures include Digital Concepts' headquarters, and facilities for Mitsubishi and Stevens Painton. Early this year, they were joined by several other corporate tenants, including the Pittsburgh Penguins, whose organization has built a 100,000-square-foot training center comparable to the Steelers' Latrobe redoubt.<P>
One reason for the commercial response is the 100%, five-year tax abate-ments the county was able to offer after financing infrastructure improvements with $5 million raised through a bond issue and another $2.5 million obtained in state and federal grants.<P>
Equally compelling, Piatt says, is the location: 20 miles from Pittsburgh International Airport and 16 miles from downtown Pittsburgh, with nary a traffic signal along the way.<P>
Robert Umstead, executive director of the Washington County Redevelop-ment Authority, says the key to tapping this location's commercial potential - and, concomitantly, increasing the county's tax base - was persuading state officials to build the interchange nearby. The commonwealth had already been planning to place a new interchange somewhere between Canonsburg and Bridgeville. Getting state officials to build it near Southpointe, Umstead says, "was one of the big hurdles."<P>
Had the interchange been built elsewhere - or if Millcraft hadn't focused on the land that is now Southpointe - the project might never have been realized. Says Piatt: "We really didn't have any other parcels in mind."
<P>
<b>Gone Public<BR></b>
<img align=left hspace=5 src="0695.Feature.1.3.gif">
Five years ago, four computer scientists from Carnegie Mellon University formed a company, with no additional employees, to design and manufacture systems to speed the transfer of information over computer networks.<p>
In typical computer parlance, they named their company in cryptic capitals representing the first names of the founders: Francois J. Bitz, Onat Menzilcioglu and Robert D. Sansom, each a vice president and director, and Eric C. Cooper, chairman, president and chief executive officer.<P>
Yet there has been nothing typical about the market's rapid acceptance of Fore's products, nor anything cryptic about its meteoric growth.<P>
Gross sales rose from $111,000 in 1991 to $23.5 million in the year ending March 31, 1994. The company reported that sales reached $75.6 million in the year ended March 31, 1995.<P>
The Warrendale-based concern went public in May 1994, and its stock sky-rocketed from the initial price of $16 per share to $70 per share just before a two-for-one split in late December. The April 17 issue of Fortune listed Fore Systems as the fourth fastest-growing company in the country. And as of late April, Fore's work force had grown from the four founders to more than 360 employees.<P>
Indeed, remarks Don Reckles, public relations manager, it's a company that would seem more at home in the Silicon Valley than in the Ohio Valley.<P>
Fore's success began with an early, tight grip on the theretofore untapped commercial market for solutions to local area networking problems through asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) technology.<P>
The company's initial products derived from a research and development contract with Naval Research Laboratories, according to Reckles. The four founders, who retained the patents on the innovations developed for the Navy labs, started shipping products in November 1991.<P>
Fore's prominence in the market is attributable, says Reckles, to the compa-ny's development of technology to ease networking between computers or different groups of computers in local areas - systems separated by relatively short distances.<P>
"Most people were concentrating on wide area networking. These guys took the other viewpoint. They saw it sooner than others," Reckles says.<P>
Another reason Reckles cites for Fore's jackrabbit start is its development of individual systems that could handle the network transfer of information in different forms: data, video, imaging and voice.<P>
Asked how Fore plans to stay competitive in a specific ATM market now hotly contested by the likes of IBM and Digital, Reckles contrasts his company with the others, citing its singular focus: "ATM is what we do - that's our business."
<P>

<b>The Courage to Come Back<BR></b>
I looked around,<BR>
The care, the love I found<BR>
Gave me the courage to come back.<BR>
<P>
Thus wrote Ray Werner, now chair-person of St. Francis Health System, when it launched "The Courage to Come Back" eight years ago.<P>
The lines are lyrics in the theme song of the program that annually bestows awards on individuals who have overcome spiritual defeat from illness or accidents. Presented at an annual dinner each spring that last year packed in more than 900 people, the awards are a recog-nition of triumph over the toughest kinds of adversity.<P>
The program has raised nearly $1.8 million from corporate sponsorships and the awards dinners. The money goes to pay for medical care for the indigent at St. Francis Medical Center.<P>
Werner says his inspiration for the theme song was the mettle possessed by each award winner.<P>
"One of the main reasons we do this is to get these people's stories in front of other people - there's poetry here, rich poetry. All you have to do is hear them say thank you to 900 people in a room so quiet you can hear a pin drop. To be a poet is to be heard, to let them know their lives mean a lot to other people," says Werner.<p>
Whether incredible or merely inspirational, the stories of the program's award winners are heartening.<P>
For example, there's Anthony Razzano, 19, who wasn't expected to survive the burns he received over 85% of his body in an accident at his New Castle home at the age of 12. Forty-plus operations later, and without fingers on his left hand, Razzano is playing football for New Castle High School, resuming the game he'd so desperately wanted to play at the time of the accident.<P>
And there's Bob Commer, 28, of Johnstown, a former 312-pound alcoholic and chain smoker who suffered heart attacks and a stroke. He's since been immortalized with more than 11 entries in the Guinness Book of World Records for rope-jumping milestones that include a 37-hour marathon.<P>
Rocky Bleier, the program's honorary chairman, knows a lot about coming back. After Bleier sustained severe leg wounds from shrapnel in Vietnam, doctors told him he would never play football again. He ignored this prophecy and worked to become a key player on the legendary Steeler team that brought home Superbowl trophies in the 1970s.<P>
The broadcasting of such capsuled narratives on radio and television has brought their subjects into one-on-one contact with similarly afflicted individuals in need of support.<P>
Says Senior Vice President David T. Dombrowiak: "People call after hearing things on television or radio and we try to hook them up."<P>

<b>Sino-American Generation<BR></b>
There are three ways a nation can increase its capacity to generate electric power: It can manufacture its own equip-ment to build additional new plants; it can import this equipment; or, it can use domestic resources to upgrade existing plants.<P>
When Westinghouse Electric Corp. signed an agreement with the Shanghai Electric Corp. last year, Westinghouse had become involved in all three means of generating increased power capacity in the People's Republic of China.<P>
Under the agreement signed in August 1994, Westinghouse committed an investment of about $100 million for a 35% stake in power generation equipment.<P>
U.S. Secretary of Commerce Ronald Brown, who signed the agreement in Shanghai along with Westinghouse CEO Michael Jordan, praised the joint venture as an exemplary international economic partnership.<P>
This deal and a 1993 joint venture agreement Westinghouse signed with the Chinese government are the first such arrangements between China and a U.S. company in the power generation industry.<P>
The Shanghai deal and the 1993 agreement to modernize and upgrade existing power plants, known as the Lon-Wei joint venture, represent a ready conduit for export deals in a burgeoning power market that is being pursued by competitors, including General Electric Co., Siemans AG and Boveri Ltd.<P>
Moreover, Westinghouse's well-developed relationship with the Chinese doubtless has helped to obtain contracts not directly linked to the joint ventures. The company last year announced four contracts for $140 million to supply two 350-watt steam turbine generators for the Ligang Electric Power Co. in Jiangsu.<P>
How did Westinghouse suddenly corral all this business? The answer, says Westinghouse spokesman Paul Tobin, is that the company didn't do it over two years. Rather, Westinghouse had been working on it for more than 20.<P>
With President Richard Nixon's historic visit in 1972, the United States and China agreed to normalize relations. Westinghouse became one of the first companies to send industrial envoys through the commercial swath Nixon had cut in the bamboo curtain.<P>
This preparatory work paved the way for a technology transfer agreement Westinghouse signed with the Chinese government in 1980 that designated two generator manufacturers as licensees of Westinghouse designs. The following year, Tobin says, "Westinghouse started bringing in their engineers for intensive training" at the company's power gener-ation business unit in Orlando, Fla. Over the next 14 years, about 800 Chinese engineers received training that enabled them to execute their own designs.<P>
Tobin recalls that last year's Shanghai announcement, which received wide-spread media coverage, might have seemed sudden to many observers. "But the reality is that we'd had people over there laboring in obscurity, some for more than 10 years."
<P>
<b>Public-Private R&D<BR></b>
Research laboratories in the United States are considered to be among the world's most productive, yet their dis-coveries usually have a tougher time becoming commercialized than do the fruits of foreign genius.<P>
This lamentable techno-commercial state of affairs has prompted some gov-ernment development officials to coin a somber moniker for the hapless journey from lab to plant. They call it "the valley of death."<P>
One of the few efforts to span this commercial chasm got under way last year in Lawrenceville. There, engineers from Carnegie Mellon University's renown robotics program, which develops robots for the space program, are working under the same roof with engineers from private industry. The goal: to get robotic technol-ogy to the marketplace and, as a result, to stimulate the creation of employment-intensive manufacturing jobs.<P>
"It all began with a white paper we sent to NASA in May of 1993," says the center's director, David Pahnos. "The subject was the fact that advanced mobile robotic technology would soon be ready to be commercialized and that commer-cialization models weren't working." <P>
What followed was a series of public-private agreements.<P>
After obtaining a $6.5 million grant from the state Department of Commerce, the Urban Redevelopment Authority pur-chased a six-acre site in the Lawrenceville Enterprise Zone, the former location of National Valve & Manu-facturing Co. The price: $1.3 million. The rest of the grant is going toward rehabilitating the site, which the consortium will lease from the URA.<P>
NASA has provided funding for operating expenses, and private compa-nies are supplying development funds. Among the concerns represented at the consortium thus far are New Holland Co., Caterpillar, Boeing Helicopters, Arm-strong, Silicon Graphics and LunaCorp, which intends to use robotic explorers on commercial moon launches.<P>
"It's like a big BYOB," Pahnos explains. "The state and the URA provide the hall; NASA buys the mixer; the corporations bring their own fifth; and, the engineers come in and party by developing new products."<P>
However festive, this analogy explains the roles of different entities in a serious project designed to overcome long-standing obstacles to commercial-izing technology in ways that would translate into manufacturing jobs.<P>
"We are particularly reaching out to companies that are basic industrial manufacturing firms instead of high-tech government contractors," Pahnos says. "The idea of our commercialization is to get products into main-line manufacturing."<P>
The center's founders concluded that the only way to approach this goal was to capitalize on "the strengths of the dif-ferent players."<p>

<h2>Shades of Gray</h2><i>By Angie Mullig</i>
<hr>

<img align=left hspace=5 src="0695.Feature.2.1.gif">
Southwestern Pennsylvania's senior citizens constitute an unusually large percentage of the area's population - and the numbers represent both challenges and opportunities.<p>

Though it's inevitable that as individuals we age, it seems that as a region, we're also growing older. Most people have heard the figures: Southwestern Pennsyl-vania ranks second nationally in the percentage of its population that is age 60 or older. And our region is the fourth in line when ranked by total number of residents age 60 and over.<P>
More than 20% of the region's total population is over the age of 60, and the number of people age 85 and older is the fastest growing segment of our population, increasing 32% between 1980 and 1990.<P>
This shift toward an older population - which will intensify as the baby-boom generation ages - will almost certainly dictate new and expanded social and health-care services. But will it offer oppor-tunities for economic growth?<P>
Yes and no. A study released by Pennsylvania State University examines the economic impact of the elderly in the state's rural areas. Two segments of the older popu-lation are compared - those who had lived and retired in the same community and those who had moved into a community after retirement. It seems that economic impact is linked to the type of retirement: Long-term residents have little impact on a local economy, but those who migrate to a community may provide a boost to some market segments.<P>
However, even in the case of new residents, an influx of well-to-do elderly has little overall economic impact on the state's rural regions, according to the study. In one instance, the demand for housing had a positive impact on local construction trade - but the gain was offset by Pennsyl-vania's tax code, which exempts most of the elderly population's income from state and local taxes. The study also determined that new jobs created by a migration of affluent elderly tend to be low-wage service jobs with few or no benefits.<P>
Other states have wooed retirees and enjoyed prosperity as a result. But Pennsylvania's local, property, occupation, per capita, in-come, amusement and real estate transfer tax structures make it possible for the elderly to avoid contributing to the public coffer - and offset the economic contri-butions of retirees to local communities.<P>
Statistics show that 78% of Pennsylvania's older citizens have incomes that range from adequate to affluent. Although society has traditionally thought of the elderly in terms of needs, the marketplace now is beginning to think of wants as well. Opportunities for providing consumer goods and services are being recognized as a large contin-gent of healthy, financially secure adults move into the 60-years-and-up category. Two sectors almost sure to see increased demand are healthcare and housing.<P>
<HR>
<b>The Managed Care Mandate<BR></b>
In Florida, eight major com-panies have already joined forces in an effort to persuade 27,000 retirees to switch to managed care. Joe Vater, a partner at Meyer, Unkovic & Scott who specializes in employee benefits, says the effort is now moving into Pennsylvania, and self-insured, multi-employer funds are being encouraged to consider the significant cost benefits of shifting retirees to managed care programs.<P>
Dom Pascucci, sales manager for Aetna Health Plans of Western Pennsylvania, sees the effort to switch retirees into HMOs as a major growth opportunity for managed care companies.<P>
"The federal government is losing its shirt in Medicare," says Pascucci. "Under the right circum-stances, managed care companies can take over that care, receive a portion of the premium that formerly went to Medicare, provide quality care and increased benefits - and still earn a profit. HMOs know how to manage the cost."
The projected dramatic increase in the percentage of the population that moves into the oldest, most-frail category will also drive demand for long-term home healthcare. In "The Pennsylvania Advantage and Telecommunica-tions: Business Creation and Attraction Plan," a report compiled by Bell Atlantic, skilled nursing facilities, intermediate care com-plexes and other nursing and per-sonal care facilities are expected to increase by 5%, with pro-jected dollar expendi-tures for those services rising  10% to 15% per year. The report predicts that franchised opera-tions will grow in impor-tance, providing oppor-tunities for both manage-ment and service deliv-ery. Building and running such care facilities will also require outlays for real estate, maintenance/ repair services, utilities, wholesale trade and labor. And as pressure mounts to contain costs and help seniors retain independence, the study notes, home healthcare will follow growth pat-terns established by child day care centers in the 1980s.<P>
There is a need for long-term care reform and subsidized housing to meet the needs of the 22% of the state's older adults who exist at or below the poverty level, according to Pennsylvania's "1993-1996 State Plan on Aging." But other groups are stepping in to meet the demands of more affluent seniors. They provide comfortable living now and guarantee long-term care if it is ever needed.<p>
Sherwood Oaks, a develop-ment in Cranberry Township, reflects a trend new to this region - a package that combines housing and health insurance. The development is a continuing care retirement community (CCRC) for adults age 62 and older that offers a spectrum of services designed to meet the changing needs of seniors as they age. The campus includes 257 single-story units for independent living, 37 rooms for assisted living and a 59-bed skilled nursing facility.<P>
Residents of Sherwood Oaks sign a contract that guarantees independent housing for as long as it's appropriate, and assisted living and skilled nursing facilities if and when they're needed. Resi-dents are assured of healthcare for life, says William Silbert, marketing director. "We're still educating western Pennsylvania consumers about life care," he says. "This is not a nursing home; we have a skilled nursing facility as one com-ponent, but that's not the reason to move into our community."<p>
"Most of our residents are very healthy and independent," says Judy Comer, CEO and president of Sherwood Oaks. "Some of our residents work as consultants, practice law and medicine - one is an interior decorator." And Sherwood Oaks revives a spirit of community, Silbert adds. With two-paycheck families the norm and the extended family a thing of the past, many older adults feel isolated in the neighborhoods where they've spent their lives - there's literally no one else at home. "In this type of community, there's a network of support from peers," Silbert says. "And our residents rediscover a sense of neighborhood."<P>
Long-term healthcare and nursing care are the most expen-sive medical costs older adults face as they age, Silbert continues. "Such expenses are usually not covered by Medicare," he says. At communities like Sherwood Oaks, resi-dents pay an entrance fee and monthly service fee; in return, they are guaranteed access to personal care and skilled nursing care in their community for as long as they choose to live there.<p>
The monthly service fee includes a daily communal meal, house-keeping and linen ser-vice, and a host of amenities that a country club might envy. Sher-wood Oaks' 84-acre spread features manicured nature trails, an indoor swimming pool and jacuzzi, an auditorium, a greenhouse, art studio, wood shop, photo darkroom, music room and a five-acre stocked lake. Resident committees are active participants in the community's governance. Activities ranging from regular trips to Pittsburgh for concerts and theater productions to on-site continuing education and exercise classes are available.<P>
But Comer stresses a strong respect for the residents' inde-pendence - people come and go, participate in activities and pursue interests as they please.<P>
Such a lifestyle carries a price tag. Entrance fees for a one-bedroom unit range from $81,000 to $121,000; the monthly fee is $1,535 for an individual, $2,245 for a couple. If that sounds steep, compare the cost to the monthly rates of a personal care home: Based on double occupancy, the cost average is $912, according to a report issued by the South-western Pennsylvania Partnership for Aging. Nursing home stays are even more expensive, and there are no guarantees that places will be available if an older adult requires such accommodations.<P>
Lutheran Affiliated Services is another organization providing services ranging from retirement living to specialty services for those with Alzheimer's disease. LAS-managed facilities include the LAS/St. John Lutheran Care Center, a skilled nursing facility; Newhaven Court at Passavant, an assisted living apartment complex, and the Passavant Retirement and Health Center in Zelienople, which includes cottages and apartments and optional services like personal and medical care.<P>
But some seniors are not looking for care - only like-minded (and -aged) neighbors. LAS recently launched an independent-living retirement community, the Village at Spring Crest. A condominium develop-ment near Latrobe, the older-adults-only complex has no health and personal care services; there are no communal meals, no on-site care-giving staff. Spring Crest was designed for the active, older adult who prefers the convenience and security of condo living, says Robert E. Johnson, LAS vice president for marketing, who thinks the development reflects a growing emphasis on healthy old age.<P>
Is there a market in south-western Pennsylvania for such a development? Apparently so. Recently more than 300 people attended an open house celebrat-ing Spring Crest's first units. LAS is exploring the possibility of building more units on other parcels, but Johnson says the scarcity of large tracts of affordable land within Allegheny County necessitates looking for sites in Westmoreland, Butler and Beaver counties.<P>
The need for a variety of living options is a primary concern for older adults, says Pamela J. Casey, a member of an accreditation team from the Continuing Care Accreditation Commission. CCAC is a national commission made up of consumers and professionals that rates continuing care retire-ment communities on a host of factors. Earlier this year, Casey and fellow team members Cynthia H. Dunn and David Scruggs were in the region doing that assessment, which includes rating admini-stration, planning, personnel, marketing strategies, the quality of resident life, the scope and quality of services, and the community's financial resources.<p>
"Nationally, it looks as if the rate of building is keeping pace with current needs," says Dunn. She notes that the growth in older-adults communities is a fairly recent development in the Pittsburgh market, though common in eastern Pennsylvania and the southern United States. One of the reasons for this, says Johnson of LAS, is that Pittsburghers are "condo-resistant." We like our single family homes - nationally, condominiums average 20% of urban residences, but in Pittsburgh, just 5% of the housing stock is in condos.<P>
Waiting lists for apartments in retirement communities vary according to market, Scruggs says, but generally waiting lists are shorter than they were a few years ago. Not only are there more units available, he explains, but community-based services have also grown, allowing those who want to remain in their home to 
do so.<P>

<b>More Than Health and Housing<BR></b>
<img align=left hspace=5 src="0695.Feature.2.3.gif">
While housing and healthcare are the obvious growth areas, other industries are attracting patronage from senior citizens.<P>
For some time, retailers have wooed older adults with senior citizen discounts; now other industries are beginning to notice the financial clout of the older population. Banks are finding it worth their while to open branches in retirement communities, and some are offering special checking programs and services like reverse mortgages. According to the International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub Association, the elderly exercise with gusto; men in the 65-plus category average 180 visits to their club each year.  Smart marketing calls for new programs to attract even more older members to the health club scene.<P>
Other groups have created inroads to this market, too. The Allegheny County Bar Association is offering special programs to assist low-income elderly people with preparing wills, living wills, creating power of attorney and estate planning documents, and untangling legal issues surround-ing Medicaid and Medicare. The association's Young Lawyers section offers the Very Important Papers Program to affluent elderly seeking legal advice on such issues as living wills and powers of attorney.<P>
When launching a new product or service, it's important to recognize that the elderly are not a homogeneous group. "Twenty years ago, we focused on warehousing' sick, old people," says Johnson. "We have to abandon stereotypes. People who are elderly represent the full spectrum of education, health, income and interests found in younger adults."<P>
This diversity creates a host of marketing opportunities, ranging from in-home services to help older adults maintain their inde-pendence to investment, educa-tion and entertainment opportu-nities that cater to the elderly.<p>
With the huge baby-boom segment - the best-educated, most affluent generation in this country's history - marching toward retirement, businesses that begin developing products targeting the diverse needs of older adults today will have a competitive edge tomorrow. <P>
<HR>
<b>Re-defining Old Age<BR></b>
The good news is that medical advances have dramatically lengthened the average person's life span. The bad news is that medical advances have dramatically lengthened the average person's life span.<P>
At the turn of the century, most people didn't worry about how they would live at the age of 90 because most people didn't expect to come close to that age.<p>
But now a sizable portion of the population can expect to live for decades beyond retirement. And while medical advances have improved the health of the elderly, it's also true that the longer the life, the greater the risk of chronic disease, disability and age-related impairment.<P>
Longevity has made the broad terms "senior citizen" and "elderly" obsolete. A few years ago, government and social service agencies began to create categories within those age designations - the young-old (age 60 to 70), the middle-aged old (age 70 to 85), and the old-old (over age 85). Other categories began to appear as well, as efforts were made to distin-guish among active, independent older adults; older adults who could remain independent with a little help; the frail elderly, and those with severe illnesses or incapacitating conditions.<P>
The stereotype of "old" is someone who is mentally and physically incapacitated, impoverished, incapable of self care - and living in a nursing home. But census data show otherwise: In Pennsylvania, less than 6% of those over the age of 60 live in personal care or nursing homes. More than 63% of those over the age of 65 live in what the census defines as family households. Although "family household" may include parents living with an adult child, most often the senior citizen family household is an older married couple living independently.<P>
For the population that does not reside in a nursing home, about 20% have some mobility or self-care limitation. These limitations can range from such relatively minor things as finding it difficult to drive at night to an inability to bathe or dress without assistance. The limitations, however, tend to increase with age. Only 7% of those between 65 and 74 years of age need help with self care or routine activities of daily living; that figure jumps to 44% in the 85-plus age group. Even here, however, the definition of help varies widely - a healthy 88-year-old woman who may need a cleaning service to tackle heavy housekeeping chores may be perfectly comfortable and capable of preparing meals, bathing, dressing, paying bills and managing all other aspects of living independently. An incapacitating illness, on the other hand, may dictate home services that range from bathing and dressing the client to providing skilled nursing care.<P>

<B><font size =+2>Teaching the American Dream</font></B><br>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Education is one key to boosting local entrepreneurs.<BR></B></FONT SIZE><br><i>By Mark Sullivan</i>
<p>
Many people dream of starting their own business. And many of those dreams remain just that, because the start-up seems overwhelming.<P>

But there are those who believe that entrepreneurial ventures are the key to jumpstarting southwestern Pennsyl-vania's economy. Though currently not a haven for entrepreneurs, the region is not without resources to attract them. Increasingly, local universities are taking the lead in doing so.<P>

"This region has the worst entrepreneurial vitality in the country," says Thomas Canfield, president of the Enterprise Corporation, a nonprofit founded in 1983 to promote entrepreneurship and help people to start and build businesses. "We do not make it easy on entrepreneurs. We need some symbols to say we are an entrepreneurially-friendly town,' and linking in to the universities, which attract young people with the ideas, is absolutely the key."<P>

According to the results of a study done by the Enterprise Corporation, entrepreneurial activity in southwestern Pennsylvania must increase by at least 90% to create the foundation of new companies that are needed to meet the job creation goals put forth by the Regional Economic Revitalization Initiative.<P>

The analysis suggests that of the 100,000 new jobs needed in the region, 30,000 will come from companies that don't currently exist. Others agree. "The economy in Beaver is so depressed that small business is the best shot for revitalization," says Randy Nutter, chairman of the business, accounting and management depart-ment of Geneva College. <P>

Alarmingly, the study points out that the rate of new companies being formed in this area is 27% below the state average. Pennsylvania ranks 50th of 50 states in a study of entre-preneurial vitality done by the Center for Enterprise Development in Washington, D.C. It is from these statistics that Canfield takes the region's low rating. To meet national growth, the number of new companies being formed in our region must double.<P>


<b>Mining Regional Resources</b><br>
Coal, iron and water used to be considered our primary regional resources, but the Enterprise study points a different direction, to "talented people, knowledge and technology." The best place to mine for these resources? Local universities. <P>

"Universities have the highest potential for spinning out technical companies," says Jack Thorne, director of Carnegie Mellon's Donald H. Jones Center for Entrepreneurship and founder of the Enterprise Corporation. "Universities can either thwart these companies or support them, depending on their encouragement activities."<P>

At Carnegie Mellon, University President Robert Mehrabian has pushed the transfer of technology from the labs and classrooms into the community. CMU can provide resources to help en-trepreneurs license and take a product to market. In return, CMU receives an agreed upon percentage when the venture turns a profit. CMU will give faculty entrepreneurs a two-year leave of absence to start a business. <P>

"The university can help them find management for their ideas," Thorne says. "CMU sees it as its mission to take what is learned and give it to the outside world and make sure it gets used."

There are also three Small Business Development Centers in the region, at St. Vincent College, Duquesne University and the University of Pittsburgh. These centers are part of a state network of 14 such centers which provide comprehensive assistance to new and emerging businesses in their areas at no charge. They also provide entrepreneurship training and seminars throughout the year. Washington and Jefferson College, California University of Pennsylvania, Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Geneva College and Slippery Rock also service would-be entrepreneurs.<P>

A major factor in many of these programs is the affiliation and support of the Ben Franklin Technology Center (BFTC), which anchors an entire web of entrepreneurial assistance. The three-fold mission of BFTC is to support growing industries, invest money in new technology and take advantage of Pennsylvania's impressive research capabilities.<P>

"If entrepreneurs are working on an idea or product or process that will put western Pennsylvanians to work, they should come to us no matter where they are in the commercialization process," says Larry McGeehan, BFTC president.<P>

By supporting regional programs, BFTC's web of support reaches into local communities. Since the late '80s BFTC has helped fund Geneva College's Center for Technology Development, which gives small companies resources to develop ideas for new technology. Small business owners work on their ideas with teams of faculty and students. When the product is finished, they can consult the business department for advice on how to market the new product. To date, two products have gone to market and several others are in development.<P>

<HR>
<b>The Chicken or the Egg?<BR></b>
Because local business people are not raised in a culture promoting entrepreneurialism, it doesn't top career choice lists. <P>

"Too often I see students who have never thought about entrepre-neurship," says Dr. Tom Falcone, chairman of the management depart-ment at Indiana University of Pennsylvania. "So many students have good ideas and high energy, but they presume that there'll be a job for them at a big company. I see that as a mistake."<P>

In today's economy it can take between six months and a year to find a "real" job: one with benefits, a future and a salary big enough to pay the rent. Even then, job security is questionable. Time spent sending out resumes and cover letters could be invested in starting a new business. Although it's an attractive alternative for recent college graduates, too often students aren't exposed to the idea.<P>

"We need to encourage and train those who have an entrepreneurial bent," says Bill Newlin, a corporate finance lawyer with Buchanan Ingersoll and an architect of Pittsburgh's high tech foundations.<P>

"You can take those who have the inclination and develop it by having schools focus classes on encouraging the entrepreneurial spirit," says Newlin. But he cautions that formal classes don't always excite those with the entrepreneurial spirit. "These classes should be taught by people who are entrepreneurs themselves because they can convey the feeling that being an entrepreneur is exciting and a worth-while pursuit."<P>

Ami Elis, president of Elcomp Systems and a graduate of CMU, thinks that good entrepreneurial programs balance the theoretical with the practical.<P>

"You need to teach the students the mechanics of starting a business. Teach them the little things like where resources are," says Elis. "On the other hand, you need to work on real-life projects. In my classes at Carnegie Mellon we worked on real-life problems, one of which became my business."<P>

<B>Growing Entrepreneurs in Captivity<BR></b>
CMU's Center for Entrepreneurial Development, located in East Liberty, is headed by Dwight Baumann, professor of engineering design. Baumann claims that he is the founder of entrepreneurial classes, having taught the first in 1960 at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.<P>

Today, Baumann is an entrepreneurial legend. According to a 1983 interview with Smithsonian magazine,  he moved to the region in 1970 to prove that entrepreneurship could be taught, at a time when Pittsburgh was void of entrepreneurial activity. The Entrepreneurial Center, started in 1971, has spun out such successes as Compuguard, Bactex, Suprex, Ergonics, Vectran and Remlik Foods.
Baumann evaluates the ideas of the students in his entrepreneurship class, and promising ones get their start using office space in the center's five-story building. Sometimes, financial support can even be found. This leg up can make or break an idea.<P>


<b>Finding "Adventure" Capital<BR></b>
"Adventure capital" is the term coined for funding of young upstart businesses, because their development is never predictable. In the Enterprise survey, insufficient capital was the biggest impediment to entrepreneurial activity.<P>

"If you are already in business and you are producing something, it's no problem to get money. But if you are just starting out, it's difficult. That is why businesses die on the vine," says Jack Roseman, associate director of the Donald H. Jones Center for Entrepreneurship. <P>

Canfield advocates setting up a regional adventure capital fund - something no other region has done to date. For now, universities are helping alleviate this problem with incubation centers like the one that Baumann runs at CMU. Indiana University of Penn-sylvania also has one.<P>

<b>Running Behind</b><br>
Despite the number of entrepre-neurial training programs, the region needs to deepen this resource to become real players. The Enterprise Corporation recommends that univer-sities improve their entrepreneurial programs until three local universities become ranked among the top national contenders. But education must start before the university level.<P>

"We need to begin in grade school to establish a link that develops an attitude of entrepreneurship. The process should be similar to developing a long-term basketball team and building a program. At an early age children might be more inclined," says Mike Brna, director of the Entrepreneurial Assistance Center at California University. That can start early: Canfield says that in Indianapolis, Junior Achievement, a business outreach to grades K through 12, reaches 50% of students. In Pittsburgh, 3% to 4% are exposed. <P>


<b>The Numbers Game<BR></b>
But training in these developing programs does the area little good if students must go elsewhere after graduation in order to realize their potential. The need most frequently cited to those conducting the Enterprise study was the need to attract and keep would-be entrepreneurs. <P>

"We are attracting students because of the reputation of the schools here," says Canfield. "Forty percent of all students that graduate from GSIA [The Graduate School of Industrial Administration at CMU] eventually start their own company. But if they moved to Denver for a job after they graduated, they'll likely start that company in Denver."<P>

The problem is the lack of job oppor-tunities in entrepreneurial companies.  "We need to glue them here by offering job opportunities with entre-preneurial companies where they can cut their teeth, learn their craft and then be compelled to start a business themselves," says Canfield.<P>

In the meantime, they make a home and a family here, and they stay here. The average age of an entrepreneur starting a business is 30 to 31 years, says Canfield, after a few years of working for someone else. <P>

The region's demographic mix is another drawback. [See Shades of Gray, page 50.] Just 15% of Pittsburgh's popu-lation is in the 25-35 age bracket. In Seattle and Boston both, over 20% of the population is the age when people most likely start businesses. <P>


<b>Slow Start-Up<BR></b>
Given the region's lag in entre-preneurial activity, can we count on new businesses to fill the necessary economic gaps? No one seems ready to throw in the towel.<p>
"Although we have a good infrastructure of support groups, we don't have risk capital and the tradition of starting new companies," says CMU's Thorne, "but it is starting to come." <P>

"Entrepreneurs are very diverse, ranging from high tech to mom and pop. But high tech is not everything. It is important, but you can't look down on those who are only trying to make a living for themselves and their families," says IUP's Falcone.  It is here, perhaps, that purposes of education and economic develpment will diverge. <P>

"Just 7% of the businesses that are started turn out to be the gazelles - the ones that really create the jobs," says Canfield. "It's often the difference between selling a product or service regionally or nationally, bringing in money from outside the region, as opposed to starting up a beauty shop.  We have to focus on the gazelles."
<HR>
<b>Four Myths About Financing a New Business</b>
<P>
The Enterprise study dispels these common misconceptions:
1. Most companies can "boot strap" themselves to be self-sufficient. In other words, an individual can start a business using their own personal savings and loans from friends and family. This myth breaks down when you consider that people between the ages of 25 and 35 haven't had a chance to accumulate extra capital.<p>

2. Entrepreneurs with good ideas always find the money they need. In the early stages of development, when capital is most needed, it is the most difficult to find. The Enterprise Corporation says that of the 125 or so entrepreneurs that come to them for help each year, about 10 of those with viable ideas cannot secure the money they need to succeed. <p>

3. There are plenty of "adventure capitalists" in Pittsburgh. Over the years there have been a few private investors, but not enough. What the region needs are more rapid growth companies to nurture small companies in their develop-mental stages.<p>

4. The Ben Franklin Program and the federal Small Business Innovation and Research Program (SBIR) are sufficient forms of capital. Not all companies can qualify for the Ben Franklin programs because of its focus on technology.                    <p>-- M.S.

<B><font size =+2>Business Golf:  Do It With Attitude</font></B><br>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>A little preparation can avert a lot of anxiety.</B></FONT SIZE><p><i>By Sandy Thomas</i>
<p>
Clear blue skies magnify the warm rays of sun beating down on your arms. The smell of fresh grass lingers in your nostrils. Steel golf spikes crunch on the asphalt as you drift towards the first tee. You're thankful for five hours of freedom from the office phone and irritating peers.<P>

Bright white golf carts gather around the encampment of the first tee. Out of the corner of your eye, you catch a glimpse of motionless, semi-erect bodies as eager golfers gently tap practice putts into three and a half inch diameter holes. Silence penetrates the air. Sports tension begins to mount, and a mild excitement flushes through your body as you prepare to take your position on the first tee.<P>

Suddenly, anguish, the fear of everybody watching, jump-starts your heart rate. Your heart positions itself in your throat. You begin to shoot up silent prayers, "Please, God, don't let me screw up." You swing; the adventure begins.<P>

Is there any way to avoid this annual, annoyingly public reckoning with your own golf skills - or lack thereof - the inevitable result of being an infrequent, business golfer?<P>

For the newer player, or someone who gets out just a few times each summer, here are a few practical suggestions. These tips - and a lot of attitude - will put you on the first tee filled with golf confidence.<P>


<b>1. Be prepared.<BR></b>
Arrive at the golf course at least 45 minutes before your designated starting time. Change your shoes, find the rest room and head to the practice tee. Even if you just hit 10 chip shots, it will help loosen your tense office muscles. Ideally, you should hit 20 to 25 practice balls with a variety of clubs.<P>

Next stop, the putting green. Practice putting. Courses vary, and a few minutes on the putting green will help you get a feel for the speed of the greens. At least 60% of your putts should be from the two- to three-foot range. Dropping those short putts will help build your frail confidence.<P>

If you analyze mathematically what is about to happen on the golf course, at least 30 of the strokes you encounter will be putts. If you two putt nine of the 18 holes and three putt the other nine, that will be 45 strokes added to your score. A few minutes on the putting green is a good investment.<P>


<b>2. Know the rules and etiquette.<BR></b>
Rules are black and white. If you don't know the rules, it will appear that you are cheating. The IRS doesn't over-look tax obligations because you're bewildered by tax laws. Your golf partners will have that same pitiless IRS mentality: They expect you to know the rules.<P>

The lack of proper golf etiquette smacks of rudeness. Simple considerations like repairing your ball marks on the green, carefully raking sand traps, replacing divots and maintaining absolute silence while someone is hitting reflect common courtesies. If you overlook the basics, much will be inferred about your character and business ethics.<P>


<b>3. Attitude</b>
Golf is a mind game. Poor play will drop you to the depths of depression in just a few short minutes.<P>

Suppose you have a bad hole, shoot a nine instead of the regulation par four. A tree jumps up and grabs your tee shot in mid-air, then throws your ball into the deep rough out of bounds. You struggle and hit a low liner banana ball into a massive sand trap. Gracefully, you skulled the ball out of the trap, airmailing it across the green. You dump a simple wedge shot, and feel grateful to have dropped the third putt.<P>

An ugly hole, an ugly memory. We've all been there. Humility was not your goal. How can you possibly approach the next tee? Where is the confidence?<P>

The right attitude is to immediately re-build. Forget the bad hole. Overcome the choking feeling in your throat. Move on and play each shot on the remaining holes to the best of your ability.<P>

Golf anger will destroy your confidence. Keep a positive attitude by viewing the rest of the course as a new adventure.<P>


<b>4. Confidence<BR></b>
There are a number of ways to increase your golf confidence.<P>

Take lessons. You take your car in for regular tune-ups, and it makes sense to see a good golf pro for a golf swing tune-up, too. But all golf professionals are not necessarily good teaching professionals: Ask the better players you know to recommend a high-caliber teaching professional. Drive the extra distance; pay a few extra dollars. It is worth the time and expense to learn from a top-notch instructor.<P>

Participate in off-season training. Read golf magazine articles and books to improve your knowledge. Take a winter golf vacation in the Carolinas, Florida or the Southwest. Improve your physical condition; join a health club and get on a regular exercise and strength training program. Wouldn't it be nice to hit your tee shots five to 10 yards farther next summer? Winter workouts not only make you feel energized and look better but also may contribute to lowering your golf scores.<P>


The game of golf is a leveler of egos. One missed shot can bring your heart to your throat, tears to your eyes or fury to your soul.<P>

But golf outings with friends or business associates should be viewed with excitement and enjoyment. They are not a time of terror. Simply come prepared. Play your game one shot at a time. Forget the bad holes; focus on your achievements, the good shots.<P>

Take the time to enjoy the warmth of the sun and the smell of freshly cut fairways. Enjoy your companions. The office will be there Monday.<P>

Togetherness. That's what we need to succeed at economic development in this region.<p>
This area's fractionalized approach to economic development exacts a hefty price in lost opportunities. Over 200 economic development agencies, each singing a slightly different tune, results in a cacophony of sounds distasteful to most listeners. Disjointed development, at times, can be worse than no development at all.<p>
The word "together" is strikingly similar to the words "to gather." That's probably not accidental.<p>
This area needs to gather its economic development agencies, and channel their energies and resources into one, single, cohesive effort. Stewarded by CMU President Robert Mehrabian, the Regional Economic Revitalization Initiative (RERI) proved that this community can work together across all demographic and geographic boundaries to shape a strategic vision and to espouse a list of agreed upon priorities. Not to diminish RERI's accomplishments, but implementing its recommendations is the tougher challenge.<p>
The Working Together Consortium, is the group orchestrating the implemen-tation of the RERI recommendations, and definitely faces the more imposing assignment. Headed by a stellar corporate and community leader, Dick Simmons, chairman of the board of Allegheny Ludlum Corporation, the Working Together Consortium holds true promise. Heralded by many as the salvation for local economic development efforts, the consortium will succeed only if the "Together" in their name really stands for to gather. The consortium must engage 200-plus economic development agencies throughout the community in its efforts to revitalize the local economy. Then, it must reach beyond traditional organizations to enlist the entire community in our region's job creation activities.<p>
We desperately need a single point of entry to this community - a veritable storefront for economic development. This storefront must represent more than the four primary agencies involved in the Greater Pittsburgh Development Initiative (GPDI), a joint-venture of the World Trade Center, the Greater Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce, RIDC and Penn's Southwest. Although the GPDI is a good beginning, it mustn't stop at four agencies. It must embrace the entire economic development spectrum and the community at large.<p>
This area's job creation rate is one-quarter of the national average. A sad commentary indeed. We must, therefore, quadruple our economic development efforts. The untapped synergy between economic development agencies is a tremendous source of new energy and better results.<p>
Through RERI, we gathered our thoughts. Now we must gather our community. <p>

<font size =+2><B>An Incentive to Learn</B></font size><p>
The April issue's "Johnny Can't Read" article nicely conveys the need for continued development of innovative school-to-work oppor-tunities for Pennsylvania students and businesses.<p>
Student apprenticeship programs are a winning situation for all involved. Businesses will spend less money teaching new employees basic work skills; students will graduate from high school with expanded options to pursue further study, enter the work force or enter a union apprenticeship program with the advantages of real world training and practical appli-cations of academic work.<p>
Pennsylvania Senate Bill 581 creates guidelines for student appren-ticeship programs. The bill gives local businesses, schools and economic development organizations local control in developing appropriate programs to meet regional needs and resources. The plan also encourages schools to develop training specialties based on their communities' needs by utilizing the proven magnet school concept.<p>
Senate Bill 582 offers tax credits for businesses who participate in a student apprenticeship program.<p>
Such unique partnerships between the private business community and education will help make today's students into tomorrow's well-qualified, high skilled workers.<p>

Melissa A. Hart <br>
Pennsylvania State Senator<p>

<!IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="GuestEditor.gif"> <FONT SIZE=+2><B>Can Public and Private Interests Converge?</B></FONT SIZE><br><i>By Emily Buka</i><P>

Successful eco-nomic develop-ment initiative in Pittsburgh, par-ticularly in real estate, has histor-ically combined efforts of public and private sectors. Pittsburgh serves as a model to the nation in this regard. Finding common ground among conflicting objectives is essential to these alliances.<p>
Traditionally, public sector dollars are used to revitalize blighted sites. Tax dollars are used to assemble land, remedy environmental problems and provide infrastructure. Once prepared, these sites are available to private developers. The public involvement thereafter is often limited to low interest financing to reduce higher building and occupancy costs.<p>
When the public steps aside, having returned valuable inner city land to productive use, the private sector assumes control. In return for the initial public sector investment, private developers may need to meet some job creation and are precluded from speculating on the improvements. They are essentially, however, free to pursue their entrepreneurial objectives uninhibited.<p>
A second model of public-private partnerships, popular in the 1980s, is far more complex. In addition to eliminating blight, these projects also have social and community development goals, like assistance to start-up companies, support for businesses owned by women and minorities, and job training. The partners, public and private, develop and own these projects together.<p>
The public side typically includes nonprofit entities, supported by philanthropists. Their charters mandate more ambitious social and community development objectives.<p>
On the other side, the private partners and lenders endeavor, as usual, to maximize their return on investment and secure the collateral.<p>
This model worked well when real estate ownership provided favorable tax benefits, especially income tax credits. Private investors were willing to forgo cash flow as long as they derived returns from the deferment of taxes.<p>
In the late 1980s, the tax benefits in real estate were virtually eliminated. The private partners were left not only with no cash flow but also with the threat of horrendous tax liabilities in the event of foreclosure.<p>
Most speculative commercial real estate was similarly disadvantaged. Unlike investors in purely private transactions, however, private partners in combined ventures could point to their public partners' objectives as the problem. If marketing was reoriented to only credit worthy tenants, they reasoned, projects could be saved. Consequently, pressure to change the nature of these projects by eliminating their public purposes, and by leasing to anyone who could pay the rent, was inevitable.<p>
Given this history, are there ways for the public and private sectors to partic-ipate together in real estate projects which go beyond the restoration of inner city sites, attracting private capital and development expertise? Yes, but only if certain guidelines are met.<p>
<dl>
<li>  Define each party's objectives.
Surprises can be deadly. The first topic of discussion should lay out respective expectations. If new small businesses are the public goal, when is the goal achieved? There should be a defined point when the public goals have been met. At this juncture, an exit for the public partner should be available.<p>
Our experience indicates that real estate develop-ments cannot sustain too many public purposes or they become more appro-priate for public institutions than for speculative real estate projects.<p>
On the private side, the private developer/investor can quote an expected rate of return or level of secu-rity but should be reminded that all real estate is risky. Developers and investors must be forewarned against expecting public bailouts just because they have a public partner.<p>
<li>  Underwrite the project realistically.
Excessively aggressive forecasts can lead to disappointments. The public partner may be especially vulnerable to overly optimistic projections in its desire to see the project under way.<p>
In addition, there is the danger of wasting scarce public resources. It is critical that tax and philanthropic dollars be targeted to projects and pro-grams with the biggest impact. If the ultimate amount of subsidy to a venture is not known to funders until it is too late, other projects and programs with better social returns will have suffered.<p>
Though some developments may not be appropriate for private equity,. nonprofits need design, construction, leasing and other private expertise throughout the complex development process.<p>
In the end, public-private devel-opments can work if both parties are aware of their potentially conflicting interests. Finding and building the common ground is the challenge.<p>

<I>ER Index is compiled by Doug Thomas, vice president and director of research at the HomeState Pennsylvania Growth Fund in Lancaster.</I>
<HR>
The ER Index roared through the last weeks of March, gaining 3.96% for the month ended April 7, while the S&P 500 for the same period was up 3.44% . Since the inception of the index in August 1994, we have seen a gain of 10.25% compared with the S&P 500's gain of 9.80% during the same period.<p>
Of our 25 stock index, American Eagle Outfitters led the pack, appre-ciating 51.79% to 21 1/4. The company reported a sales increase of 64% to $18.7 million, on same store sales gains of 6%, for the five weeks ended April 1. This increase came amidst a 5.92% decline in the Bloomberg Specialty Apparel Same Store Sales Index, which includes such companies as the Gap, The Limited and Ann Taylor.<p>

<DL>
<LI>General Nutrition Companies (GNC) also had a stellar month, gaining 18.32%. In mid-March the company announced earnings for the fourth quarter and year ended Feb. 4, 1995. EPS for the year increased 48% to $1.14 per share on a 23% increase in net revenues to $672.9 million. Additionally, in recent weeks rumors have surfaced regarding a possible acquisition of Nature's Bounty, a New York-based manufacturer of vitamins and supplements.
<LI>In past weeks, aluminum and steel stocks have come back into favor as stronger demand has enabled many companies to raise prices. Alcoa has been a major beneficiary of the industry's resurgence. The company reported first quarter earnings of $1.08 per share versus 5 cents per share, on a 36% increase in revenues to $3 billion, exceeding Wall Street's expectations of 71 cents. These increases can be largely attributed to sharply higher prices for fabricated aluminum products. Alcoa has also announced its first step into China through its acquisition of 60% of a Shanghai, China aluminum fabrication plant in a joint venture with the Shanghai Bureau of Light Industry.
<li>Legent was the biggest loser of the month, declining 16.18% to 28 1/2. In recent weeks, Legent Chairman Jerre Stead has made some significant changes to the company infrastructure. In doing so there have been several personnel changes, including the addition of Glen Hazard, formerly of AT&T Global Solutions, who will take the position of vice president of business transformation and CIO. Additionally, Franchon M. Smithson, the company's CFO and senior vice president, announced that he would be leaving to pursue other opportunities. As we went to press, Legent announced that second quarter earnings would come in slightly lower than expected, around 43 cents per share versus the expected 50 cents per share on revenue of $121 million. The shortfall is a result of changes in its sales structure that have resulted in slower than expected earnings growth.
<li>NorthStar Health Services, the Pittsbugh-based provider of rehabili-tation therapy, reported an increase in net income to $715,000 from $671,000, on a 119% increase in revenues to $13.4 million. The stock finished off 11.67% for the period to 6 5/8. The company has also filed to sell an additional 1.75 million shares of stock.
<li>Respironics announced the acqui-sition of Vitalog Monitoring Inc., a privately held California-based designer, manufacturer and marketer of sleep monitoring and diagnostic equipment. The acquisition will help to further enhance Respironics' effort to diagnose and treat sleep disorders, specifically in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea.
<li>Net income increased 104% in the second quarter for New Brighton-headquartered Tuscarora Inc., the nation's largest manufacturer of custom- molded expanded foam plastic products, as well as other protective packaging and material handling solutions. Net sales for the quarter increased 42.1% to $37.9 million and EPS increased 100% to 30 cents. The increase is attributed to continued strong growth in the company's primary markets, increased market share and further acceptance of the company's newer products.

A Real Bonus
Calgon Carbon Corp. President and CEO Colin Bailey reinforced his message to shareholders and employees of short-term sacrifice for long-term gain by refusing his 1994 bonus, which is an unusual and impressive gesture in today's corporate world. 
Pittsburgh-based Calgon, maker of activated carbons used to purify liquids and gases, suffered through a tough year. In 1994 the company lost $8.6 million and announced a $41.8 million restructuring that includes the closing of its operations in Brilon Wald, Germany.
But things finally seem to be turning in the right direction for the company as it is enjoying sales gains in the U.S. and Europe, its first price increases in four years and wider profit margins. The early results show a 68% rise in first quarter profits to $3.9 million, or 10 cents per share, and a 20% rise in the stock price since January.
Bailey's decision to turn down the bonus was but one of many signals Calgon has been sending the investment community recently. The company has paid a special dividend, increased its regular dividend, continued to buy back its own shares and dissolved the voting trust that was viewed by some analysts as an impediment to growth.
How much he turned down, we're not sure, but it was at least as much as was paid to Ronald Tisch, Calgon executive vice president, who received more that $26,000. Bailey's not hurting, mind you. His salary last year was $278,898. Still, in this day and age, CEOs don't turn down bonuses. "We've gotten some calls about it from investors," Gail Gerono, the company spokesperson, told Bloomberg Business News. "They've been pleasantly surprised. They've never seen anything like it before."

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Gay Grants </B></FONT SIZE><br>
The Lambda Foundation, established in 1983, is offering Work Place Equality Grants. The grants, which range from $100 to $1,000, can be used for the formation of a gay/lesbian employee group, gay-friendly hiring policies, or nondis-criminatory clauses and domestic partnership benefit plans.<p>
"This grant is intended for any individual, group, employee or employer in the Greater Pittsburgh business community with intentions of supporting Pittsburgh's gay and lesbian community by implementing gay-friendly policies and procedures," says Bill Nist, foundation president.<p>
Although several companies have requested application forms, none had been returned by press time. Nist says the goal is to fund at least $3,000 in grants this year. The foundation's board has granted more than $215,000 to gay and lesbian organizations in the past 11 years.<p>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Traveller's Aid </B></FONT SIZE><br>
Convinced that the commission cap instituted by the major airlines this spring would close many small travel agents and increase already long holds for travellers calling the airlines directly, Rosenbluth International Travel recently activated a new reservations service.<p>
By calling 1-800-33-CHOICE travellers can get air, hotel or car reservations through a trained agent. The benefits? These agents have the information at their fingertips to provide a tailored travel schedule at the lowest fares available. And you don't have to deal with the airlines directly.<p>
Rosenbluth spokesperson Liz Joseph says that the increased volume and opportunities to add to their existing client base will mean profit for Rosenbluth's despite the commission cap.<p>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>PA Job Forecast </B></FONT SIZE><br>
Healthcare and printing/ publishing are expected to be big job generators for the next 10 years in the state, according to the Penn State Center for Regional Business Analysis.<p>
David L. Passmore, professor of vocational education at Penn State in University Park, says healthcare employment should grow in Pennsylvania regardless of how reform shakes up the industry. Passmore's study shows a 36.9% growth in that sector by 2005. Even if the average annual growth in health-related industry spending was 2%, employment would still increase by 18%. Under a high-spending scenario, jobs would increase by 81%.<p>
Not all sectors will grow evenly. For example, registered nurses in the baseline forecast will increase by more than 40,000 from 1990 to 2005. At the same time, an increase of less than 300 dentists is predicted.<p>
For the printing and publishing industry, the study predicts an 11% growth in jobs by 2005. More than 75% of the new jobs will be generated by increased exports of printed material to other states and countries. Total output for the in-dustry could grow by $2.79billion.<p>
What may stimulate demand for printed products over the next decade are improvements in literacy, population and school enrollment growth, enhanced international copyright protection and lower international trade barriers. Impediments include higher postal rates, environmental legislation, increasing labor costs and challenges from electronic publishing and distribution.<p>

<hr>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Better Labor Record?</B></FONT SIZE><br>
There were fewer labor strikes in Pennsylvania in 1994 than in any previous year since 1970, the first year the state began collecting statistics, according to the Department of Labor & Industry in Harrisburg. In 1994, there were 108 strikes, six fewer than 1993.<p>
While the number of labor disputes dropped in 1994, the number of employees involved in strikes rose by 81%. Workdays lost also increased last year. Why? Many of the strikes involved large numbers of workers in steel, apparel, machinery and trucking. Those industries accounted for 76% of total lost workdays.<p>
There were 17 strikes affecting school districts, a 6% decline from 1993. Some 47 of Pennsylvania's 67 counties registered at least one labor dispute. Of 1994's stikes, 86 were in the private sector and 22 in the public sector.<p>

<hr>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Harassment Up Again</B></FONT SIZE><br>
Filings of sexual harassment went up again in Pennsylvania, by 8% over the previous year. Nearly 97% of the 432 sexual harass-ment cases filed were employ-ment related, says the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission in Harrisburg. Almost 88% were filed by women. Philadelphia County had the most filings with 77, and Allegheny came in second with 71 filings.<p>
"The commission is fast approaching a saturation point where it cannot continue to process more cases with less staff and financial support," says Robert Johnson Smith, chair of the PHRC. "Also distressing is the ever-increasing number of racial, religious and ethnic tension situations that are occurring across the commonwealth which are addressed by staff."<p>
In the 1993-94 fiscal year, 5,668 new complaints were filed, adding to 6,979 pending cases. Of the new cases, 85% were employment related. Allegheny County accounted for the majority of employment cases, with 1,099.<p>
Of the 4,842 docketed employment cases in the state, manufacturing was identified most often, 14% of the time. Medical services and retailers followed, tied at 11% of the cases.<p>
Some 29,465 informal complaints were handled by PHRC staff, up 20% from the last fiscal year, and the staff closed nearly 5,000 cases, awarding $9.4 million to victims of discrimination.<p>
The PHRC handles cases of discrimination involving race, color, religion, ancestry, age (40 and above), sex, nationality, non-job-related disability, known association with a person with a disability, familial status or possession of a GED. The commission's jurisdiction covers employment, housing and commercial real estate, public accommodations, education, refusal or willingness to participate in abortion procedures and racial tension.<p>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Pacesetters in Pittsburgh</B></FONT SIZE><br>
Last month, Executive Report got a call from the U.S. Department of Commerce's Office of Technology,  informing us that they have awarded three Pittsburgh organizations with PACE Certificates of Recognition.<p>
The three local recipients are the Donald H. Jones Center for Entrepreneurship (see "Teaching the American Dream," this issue), FORE Systems Inc.(see Best Deals, this issue) and Medrad Inc. <p>
"The purpose of PACE [Partnerships for a Competitive Economy] is for us to take technology policy debate outside of the beltway, to people in local markets," says Kelly Carnes, deputy assistant secretary for Technology Policy at the U.S. Department of Commerce. "The PACE awards highlight models of success, models people can learn from about how to compete in the new global economy, employing training and technology innovatively."<p>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Subscribers Like HMOs</B></FONT SIZE><br>
HMO consumers are more satisfied than those in fee-for-service plans, regardless of health status, according to a survey by Sachs/Scarborough HealthPlus.<p>
"Even in markets with low managed care penetration, consumers are choosing HMOs, and they are satisfied. Nationally, and in individual markets, people prefer HMOs," says Gary Pickens, senior vice president of Sachs Group Inc., Evanston, Ill.<p>
Here are some findings based on the initial results from Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver and Pittsburgh:<p>
<dl>
<li>Consumers gave themselves nearly identical rankings of 68 points, on a scale of 0 to 100, for their own health status.
<li>Eighty-two percent of the respondents in HMOs said they were satisfied with their plans, compared to 72% in traditional fee-for-service plans, 71% in PPOs and 69% covered by Medicare.
<li> People are in HMOs because they want to be: 67% of HMO subscribers had a choice of plans.
<li> HMO subscribers are pleased with the range of services. Seventy-five percent are satisfied, compared to 68% of people in fee-for-service, 67% in PPOs and 69% in Medicare.
<li> Traditional plans still rate high on access to physicians. Eighty-three percent of the people in traditional plans are satisfied with physician access for routine services, compared to 82% for those in Medicare, 77% for HMO members and 76% for PPO subscribers.

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Buyouts and Real Estate Planning</B> </FONT SIZE> 
<br><i> By Glenn R. Flickinger</i>
<hr>
Owners of closely held, small to midsize companies are discovering a new way to reach their estate planning goals and to achieve liquidity at the same time: the company buyout. Sound sur-prising? Perhaps. But buyouts, in many creative forms, are back in a major way, and the timing for such transactions for family-owned companies could not be better. There are many good reasons.<p>
Recently, the available pool of equity specifically targeted at small to medium-sized companies has grown dramatically. In the past two years alone, an estimated $5 billion in equity has been raised by various types of buyout funds throughout the United States, searching not for the mega-deals of the 1980s, but for small and medium-sized transactions in the $5 million to $100 million range.<p>
Because this equity will be leveraged with debt, the total amount of capital available for buyouts of this type exceeds $15 billion. Improved conditions in the commercial bank lending market mean the debt required to leverage this pool of equity has become more readily available, helping to increase buyout activity.<p>
All these factors have combined to result in higher prices/valuations for closely held businesses. Today, a price multiple of five to six times cash flow, occasionally even higher, is possible to achieve. That's compared to price multiples of four times cash flow available several years ago, if any buyer could be found at all.<p>
In addition, equity investors have come to better understand closely held companies. They realize that most of these firms are not managed for financial reporting purposes and tend to understate actual earnings compared with publicly held companies.<p>
These sophisticated investors know how to normalize their valuations of closely held companies, and have come to understand the enormous value imbedded in the family-held business market.<p>
According to one study, an estimated $6.8 trillion of net worth will change generational hands in the next decade. Buyouts in various forms done with the appropriate supportive investor can help businesses survive the generational transition.<p>
Equity investors focus on several key factors in searching for attractive targets. They concentrate on businesses with strong earnings histories and dominant niches in the markets they serve. They look for companies with growth potential, or those that can be strategically merged with other firms to increase value in what is referred to as a build-up strategy.<p>
The most important factor is demonstrated management capability. In general, investors are financially oriented, not operationally oriented. They desire to provide financial backing and to support strong business managers. They want little or nothing to do with day-to-day oper-ations. Therefore, the management team that will lead the company is always the focal point of any type of buyout.<p>
Equity investors have developed several variations on the basic buyout theme. In the traditional buyout of a family-held company, the business is sold to the investor and to a core manager or group of managers.<p>
The family sellers receive a cash price, sometimes 100% cash, sometimes with a portion of the purchase price tied to future performance, dependent on circumstances. The managers receive a minority equity stake alongside the new majority owners.<p>
Often the managers obtain the first refusal rights to "buy back" the company, or an "earn out" clause specifying that they can obtain ownership of the company over time under agreed upon performance levels. Management retains operating control with a knowledgeable partner to help grow the company.<p>
The variations on this basic theme are infinite and are limited only by the creativity of the buyers, sellers and their advisors. In one variation, owners desire to achieve personal liquidity without sacrificing operating control. In a private recapitalization, buyout firms will purchase a significant minority share of the value of the company so that the seller achieves partial personal liquidity for financial planning purposes, retains control of the company and obtains a financial partner who will help grow the overall value of the company.<p>
Another variation is the family succession buyout or a private family recapitalization. This involves the purchase of the company by a younger generation of family management from the prior generation. Such a transaction can achieve liquidity for estate planning purposes, transfer wealth to the younger generation and preserve the family identity of the business.<p>
The bottom line is that there are a large number of sophisticated financial buyers with large amounts of capital focusing on the purchase of family-owned businesses. Combined with the current availability of commercial bank lending, this factor has forced selling prices significantly higher.<p>
But perhaps more important than price is the fact that these investors, properly understood and properly matched to the business value of the family owners, can be excellent business partners in generational transition situations, in management transitions and in growing the value of a business.<p>
In any case, owners of closely held businesses should seriously consider the buyout as a sound estate planning alternative. And they should carefully negotiate any buyout package to achieve full value for their companies in ways that are realistic and satisfying.<p>

At a time when many people's thoughts would be turning toward retirement, Harry Ferrari is patenting an improved irradiation technology for an elastic nylon racquet string which he believes can outplay natural gut. It's all part of Gamma Sports, the tennis string and grip manufacturing company he founded in his basement following the loss of a local tournament in 1974. Ferrari maintains he lost the match because of a replacement racquet, strung with inferior nylon, which he played with after his natural gut racquet popped a string.<p>
Ferrari used his knowledge of irradiating polymers (he's a former materials scientist for Westinghouse Electric Corp.) to create a synthetic string that played as well as gut. The industry's reception was warm: The string was rated the No. 1 synthetic string in the world for 17 years running.<p>
The company has done well. Gamma Sports, which Ferrari's older son recently joined, introduced a new line of racquets, apparel and tennis balls this year. Not long ago, Gamma surpassed Prince as the second largest tennis string supplier in the world.<p>
Meanwhile, Ferrari kept his day job with Westinghouse until 1990. "The company was running so well on its own, why interfere?" he says. While at Westinghouse, Ferrari obtained more than 25 patents, published over 50 articles and received the American Nuclear Society's highest honor. And, yes, he is related to foreign auto manufacturer Enzo Ferrari. (Enzo is Harry's father's cousin.)<p>

<b><font size =+2>Violence in our community:<br></font><font size =+1>  How can we make their future safer?</font></b>



<h3>Message From Linda Dickerson</h3>
<b>Dear Readers:<BR></b>
Over the years, United Way of Southwestern Pennsylvania has used this Executive Report supplement to inform the community about the vital role it plays in bringing us all together to help our neighbors. United Way has shown us how, through a single gift, we can reach out to people confronted with abusive relationships, poverty, trouble in school, drinking and other drug problems, homelessness, teen pregnancy and a host of other problems.<P>
In this publication, United Way has also talked about its efficiency - how more than 87 cents of each dollar we give supports programs that help those in need. It's shown us that hundreds of local people serve on committees that support the annual campaign, that allocate contributions, that guide volunteer projects like United Way Day of Caring, and serve on the boards of directors, holding United Way accountable, providing oversight and making sure our gifts are used efficiently to help people with the greatest needs.<P>
With this year's supplement, our local United Way joins a variety of local individuals and organizations in bringing to our attention the issue of community and family violence, as if repeated news reports of murder, crime and domestic and gang violence are not enough to tell us there is a problem.<P>
Already individuals and organizations throughout southwestern Pennsylvania have responded, including the NAACP, U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania and U.S. Attorney Frederick Thieman, the Allegheny County Policy Council, and even the Pittsburgh Steelers. Also confronting violence are countless social agencies throughout southwestern Pennsylvania that you'll read about in this supplement.<P>
But we can't sit back and wait for these groups to act for us. We must become involved. Our United Way offers all of us that chance by two simple steps: making a pledge and volunteering.<P>
For all of these reasons and more, Executive Report supports our local United Way. If you haven't already done so, we urge you to get involved, too. If you have, I hope you'll pledge your continued support.<P>


Sincerely,<BR>

Linda Dickerson, Publisher

Violence Is a Community Issue<BR>

Violence is an equal opportunity phenomenon. It destroys without regard to race, religion, nationality or socioeconomic status. Whether it's living behind locked doors, wearing gang colors, suffering the wrath of an abusive partner, waking to the sounds of gunfire or becoming another statistic, no one is immune to its impact.<p>
According to the National Crime Prevention Council, every 17 seconds someone somewhere in the United States reports a murder, rape, robbery or assault. Still, there are those who would choose to close their eyes to this crisis rather than acknowledge the reality of violence. "Until you've watched a child get shot, it's hard to imagine. Seeing is believing," says Mike Hepler, president and CEO of Boys and Girls Clubs of Western Pennsylvania.<P>
"Violence is spreading," Hepler continues. "We must all be part of the solution."<p>
But violence is a complex problem that offers no easy solutions. Compounding the issue further is the fact that violence can take on many different forms. "There's the overt street violence," explains Bill Brammer, executive director of the Rankin Christian Center, "and there are the more subtle kinds of violence - the injustice, the neglect, the racism.<P>
"We're also experiencing something new," Brammer adds. "People are being shot for no reason. Random violence puts everybody at risk."<P>
In a society where no safe haven exists, the boundaries of violence must constantly be redefined. "Twenty years ago, domestic violence wasn't even recognized," says Marty Friday, executive director of the Women's Center & Shelter of Greater Pittsburgh (one of the first in the country). "Since that time, however, there have been changes in the laws and changes in our culture. The situation has improved."<P>
And while this piece of the puzzle has benefited from increased awareness, violence in general continues to grow in intensity. "Violence is not only becoming more violent," says Laura Tiedge, executive director of Camp Fire/Boys and Girls Greater Pittsburgh Council, "but there's also more youth-on-youth violence."<P>
The National Crime Prevention Council affirms that a disproportionate number of young people are both the victims - in excess of 5,000 children a day are subjected to violence - and the perpetrators of violent crimes. In Allegheny County, juvenile crime increased dramatically between 1988 and 1993, according to statistics from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Western District of Pennsylvania. Specifically, statistics indicate that juvenile homicide rose 400 percent; aggravated assault increased 85 percent; sex offenses increased 116 percent, and robberies, 55 percent.<P>
But how did this happen? How did violence become such an ingrained part of our lives? Some authorities point to substance abuse. "Where I sit, people are killing each other over drugs. Drugs and alcohol perpetuate violence," asserts Karen Payne, project director of the Homewood/Brushton Collaborative, a group of agencies mobilized by United Way to help substance abusing women and their families.<P>
Some believe it's the availability of guns. "There's a big difference between the right to bear arms and arming children," Hepler insists. "We have to get the guns out of the hands of the kids. Until then, we're fighting a losing battle."<P>
Others blame the media. "Television reflects violence in our society and promotes violence," Friday maintains. "Children see violence as a way of solving conflicts and getting what they want. Television desensitizes people to violence, so violence is accepted."<P>
Many look to the need to cooperate. Notes Bishop Donald Wuerl of the diocese of Pittsburgh, "Deep within each of us is the spirit of God that gives us both the desire and the strength to work together to overcome any human problem, even the violence that haunts our streets, schools, families and communities."<P>
Some look to a decline in values as the true culprit. "When I was growing up, we always had our families, our community," recalls Barbara Baulding, a project coordinator of the Urban League of Pittsburgh, which is coordinating an anti-violence initiative, "It Takes a Whole Community to Raise a Child."<P>
Explains Baulding, "The whole neighborhood raised us. That's the difference between then and now. We must work to strengthen the family and strengthen the children. Kids are our future. Without them, what will we be?"<P>
Clearly no single cause is responsible for violence, but most experts agree that without a singular effort, there's no true hope of stopping it. And that's what the individuals and organizations fighting violence deal in - hope. "Yes," Payne asserts, "I think we are making a difference, but it's a day-by-day, hour-by-hour process."<P>
And although striving to do better is often an elusive goal, it is always an essential part of any program's success. To that end, Tiedge says, "we must find creative ways to involve people, to empower neighborhoods, parents, schools. Violence isn't one agency's issue - it's the community's."<P>
So what are we doing about violence?<P>

"No one wants to live in the world we're creating right now," admits Gary Lasinski, executive director of the YMCA/McKeesport. "We try to take a positive approach. We treat young people as resources, not as problems to be solved."<P>
Nonprofits, foundations, and other community-based organizations throughout southwestern Pennsylvania share that positive philosophy. From the Boys and Girls Clubs of Western Pennsylvania to the YMCA of Beaver County, these groups have become a powerful force in the struggle against violence. Their programs are about providing choices, opportunities and hope to those segments of the population that are most at risk and most in need.<P>
The following are exam-ples of the organizations and initiatives combating violence in our community:<P>

<b>Boys and Girls Clubs of Western Pennsylvania<BR></B>
With 6,000 youth members and nine locations, the Boys and Girls Clubs, a United Way-supported agency, is looking to get more teens, particularly girls, to take advantage of its services, thereby avoiding disruptive and violent behavior. One of its newest programs - Teen Force - is a grassroots effort aimed at encouraging young people to work within their communities. <P>

<b>Boy Scouts of America, Greater Pittsburgh Council<BR></b>
More than 4,000 local youth benefit from the Scouts' Urban Scouting Program, which is supported by United Way gifts. This program prepares young men, many of whom are disadvantaged, for leadership roles in the community, and it helps them to develop a sense of responsibility. Based on the principles and lessons in the scouting manual, adult volunteers, usually parents, lead the troops, tailoring activities to meet the needs of their particular community.<P>

<b>Family Services of Beaver/Butler County<BR></b>
Breaking the cycle of violence is the key to the Play Therapy Program of the United Way-supported Family Services of Beaver/Butler County. Through music and play therapy and other activities, children under 12 who have been abused and/or who have witnessed violence in their family learn to heal their psychological and emotional trauma. In the long run, the program helps them become violence-free parents.<P>

<b>Hill House Association<BR></b>
Hill House Association helps residents of the Hill District and Pittsburgh reduce violence in the family and among youth through a variety of services, including a child care center - the after-school Kaufmann Program Center, which features computer learning and tutoring for ages 6 to 12 - and the Kay Program Center, where job training and placement are emphasized. Hill House, which United Way contributors support, is also home to Pittsburgh in Partnership with Parents, a program that enhances parenting skills and reduces violence in families.<P>

<b>Homewood/Brushton Collaborative<BR></b>
United Way mobilized 62 agencies in this cooperative effort, which seeks to serve as many families experiencing substance abuse problems as possible by putting them in touch with the appropriate organizations that can help.<P>

<b>Mon Valley YMCA<BR></b>
The YMCA's Juvenile Referral and Prevention Program is designed to address the economic and social factors contributing to violence and other problems youth face, including drugs, alcohol, peer pressure and teen pregnancy. This program of the United Way-funded agency provides education, public forums, family recreation and community socialization.<P>

<b>Mon Valley Youth and Teen Association<BR></B>
This organization offers youth a variety of productive activities, including clubs, day camps, group camping, resident camp, and youth and teen centers. In addition, the association, supported by United Way gifts, recently introduced its Teens in Control Program to deal directly with such issues as gang violence, AIDS, teen pregnancy, and drug and alcohol abuse.<P>

<b>NAACP/Pittsburgh<BR></b>
"Strategy `95: A Plan to End Violence in Pittsburgh" is the NAACP's latest initiative in this arena. Although still in the preliminary stages, the strategy's early work sessions have produced a number of viable solutions to the problem of violence. This grassroots effort will challenge employers, schools and government to join the fight.<P>

<b>Pittsburgh Action Against Rape<BR></b>
This United Way-supported agency helps victims of sexual assault, domestic violence and other violence with counseling and support services. Its educational efforts in the community also help to prevent violence.<P>

<b>Rankin Christian Center<BR></b>
Offering a number of different services, the center concentrates on developing parenting skills and personal goals. Literacy classes, support groups, pre-natal care, after-school programs and career training are all part of the United Way-supported agency's big picture approach to reducing violence.<P>

<b>Three Rivers Youth (TRY)<BR></b>
Targeting high-risk youth and their families, TRY works to prevent violence by providing a comprehensive, integrated system of services. A United Way-supported agency, TRY offers residential, educational <P>
and vocational programs as well as outpatient mental health, drug and alcohol treatment.<P>

<b>Urban League of Pittsburgh<BR></b>
In addition to its prime objective of providing employment, housing and education opportunities to youth and adults, the Urban League, which benefits from United Way contributions, recently unveiled its ground-breaking initiative "It Takes a Whole Community to Raise a Child." The project seeks to raise awareness of violence and involve the community in responding to this issue.<P>

<b>Urban Youth Action<BR></b>
Established nearly 30 years ago, UYA has managed to stay current by offering young people programs that confront issues of conflict resolution, self-esteem and negative peer pressure. The UYA, supported by United Way contributors, also provides computer instruction as well as career research, selection and planning.<P>

<b>Women's Center & Shelter of Greater Pittsburgh<BR></b>
The Women's Center & Shelter provides women and children who are living in immediate danger of domestic violence with a safe place to take refuge from violence. In addition to counseling women housed at the center, the United Way-supported agency offers other forms of counseling, including a telephone hot line and assistance to women maneuvering through the judicial system. It also strives to educate the medical community about domestic violence.<P>

<b>YMCA/McKeesport<BR></b>
Bringing services directly to a neighborhood in need is the impetus behind the Crawford Village Outreach Program of the YMCA of McKeesport, an agency that benefits from the annual United Way campaign. From cooking classes to basketball leagues, tutoring sessions to computer workshops, this program is helping more than 340 children ages 7 to 14 in this public housing community stay away from violence and violent behavior.<P>

<b>YMCA of Pittsburgh<BR></b>
Taking a proactive stand, the East End Outreach Program of the United Way-supported YMCA not only offers job internships and gang prevention activities but also places outreach workers in the communities in an effort to link youth and families with available services. Participants in the program have also started their own computer company and commercial cleaning venture, learning firsthand an alternative to violence.<P>

<b>YWCA of Greater Pittsburgh<BR></b>
The YWCA of Greater Pittsburgh is the lead agency in a multi-agency effort to reach young women involved in violent or antisocial behavior or those at risk of such behavior. The FORCE (Female Outreach Collaborative Effort) program places outreach workers in five local communities to identify the young women and then connect them with community resources. <P>

<b>Anti-Violence Initiative at work in Allegheny County<BR></b>
Residents of Allegheny County are lucky. They happen to live in one of the safest major metropolitan centers in the country. But that good news is also cause for concern. According to the U.S. Attorney's Office of the Western District of Pennsylvania, there's one aspect of violence that continues to escalate.<p>
Between 1988 and 1993, the country has seen juvenile crime increase by nearly 80 percent. And, unfortunately, Allegheny County is no exception to this national trend. During that same time period, our region has experienced a more than 50% rise in juvenile crime.<P>
In an effort to respond to this growing problem, the Allegheny County Anti-Violence Initiative was founded last year. This program presents a two-pronged plan of attack. The first component involves a concerted and coordinated effort by federal, state and local law enforcement agencies to target those individuals exposing young people to guns, violence and drugs.<P>
The second revolves around a community-wide venture to offer children alternatives to violence. To that end, a coalition of neighborhood, government, police, foundation, corporate and church representatives have joined forces to establish the Youth Crime Prevention Council of Allegheny County.<P>
The Prevention Council's goals include providing kids with after-school safe places, in-school activities, sports leagues, summer jobs, family support, mentoring, Head Start and day care programs, leadership development, health and wellness services, juvenile justice and community accountability. In addition, the Council will actively work to stop the proliferation of guns, substance abuse and domestic violence.<P>
But it won't be easy. "The problems we face didn't begin overnight," asserts Frederick W. Thieman, U.S. District Attorney, "nor will they end overnight."
However, in Thieman's view, Allegheny County has gone a long way to creating a foundation of hope. "A broad cross-section of the community has come together to act rather than argue," he affirms. "The question is not whether a well-planned Anti-Violence Initiative can succeed, but how each citizen can become part of the solution."<P>

<font size =+2>Help Stop Violence: Volunteer!<BR></font>
Putting an end to violence - whether it be spouse battering, robbery or even threats - requires personal commitment and action. One of the ways we can become involved in the solution to violence is by volunteering. Volunteering - as an individual or as a group - is uplifting for both the volunteers and the people in our community who stand to benefit.<P>

<b>Callers respond to TV show on violence<BR></b>
On the evening of March 4, Pittsburgh television stations came together in an unprecedented simulcast of "It Takes a Whole Community to Raise a Child." Designed to increase awareness of violence and commitment to becoming involved in fighting it, the telecast included the United Way HelpLine telephone number for callers who wanted more information on how they can help as well as how they can find help for community and family violence problems. Here is a sample of the 500 calls that came in that night:<P>
<dl>
<li>A man called wanting to start a sports recreation program for the youth in his community. United Way HelpLine referred him to a local agency serving youth as well as the City Department of Public Parks and Recreation.
<li>A man who runs a fencing school called to offer scholarships to young men interested in learning fencing but unable to afford lessons.
<li>A woman called for help for her two young children who, having witnessed a violent altercation in front of their home, were suffering post-traumatic stress disorder. They were referred to a local nonprofit for counseling.
<li>A film producer called to volunteer his time and talents to producing videos promoting non-violence and was referred to the Urban League of Pittsburgh.
<li>An actor wanted to become involved with theatrical productions promoting anti-drug and non-violence. He was referred to a production company of local artists concerned with our community's health.
<li>Several teachers and readers called, interested in anti-violence curricula for their students. They were referred to organizations such as the Heartwood Institute, Pittsburgh Peace Institute, and the Allegheny County Health Department violence prevention program.
<li>Many callers wanted to mentor a youth. They were referred to many local agencies, including Boys and Girls Clubs of Western Pennsylvania, Big Brothers and Sisters, Generations Together, Cities in Schools, Hosanna House and local neighborhood organi-zations and churches.
As a follow-up to the simulcast, local radio and television stations are continuing to run public service announcements that tell people how to get involved in stopping community and family violence. If you want to help, call United Way HelpLine at 255-1155.<P>

<b>Day of Caring: September 13<BR></b>
The fifth annual United Way Day of Caring will kick off the 1995 United Way of Southwestern Pennsylvania campaign Wednesday, September 13, 1995. On that day, more than 6,000 people are expected to volunteer at local nonprofits, learning firsthand some of the needs in our community and how their community service work lets them respond to those needs. If your organization would like to participate, call Carla Barricella, United Way of Allegheny County special events coordinator, at 456-6863.<P>

<b>A message to local business leaders: <BR></b>
It's time to stop the violence<P>

It's time. It's time that we did something about the violence that is ripping apart our families and our community. It's time to stop waiting for the groups and individuals already dedicated to ending violence to act for us. We must all take action.<P>
There are hundreds of ways we can help put an end to violence in our communities and in our families by doing one thing: by becoming involved in our local United Way. As campaign chairs for the United Way of Southwestern Pennsylvania partners, we challenge all local business leaders to join our organizations in supporting our community through United Way.<P>
Specifically, we ask you to conduct a United Way campaign in your organization. Make the campaign a personal and an organizational priority. Select your best people to conduct the campaign and then give them the resources to do the best job they can to plan, organize and conduct a winning campaign.<P>
United Way's single, coordinated workplace campaign offers you and your organization a comprehensive approach in:<P>
<dl>
<li> responding to multiple needs in our community at the same time
<li> saving administrative time and costs associated with conducting multiple campaigns
<li> giving employees a greater understanding of community needs and how they can become involved in responding to these needs all at the same time
<li> saving agencies the expense and time of conducting campaigns and processing pledges 
<li> contributing easily and conveniently through payroll deduction
<li> volunteering, which boosts morale among employees, builds teamwork and helps local people in need.

<FONT SIZE =+2><B> It Was a Very Good Year: The Pennsylvania 100 </B></FONT><br><FONT SIZE=+1><b>Most of Pennsylvania's largest non-financial publicly held companies continued to enjoy the recovery in 1994.</FONT SIZE></b><br>
<i>By Jane A. Black</i>
<HR>

If Pennsylvania's large, nonfi-nancial publicly held companies are any indication, the economy continued to improve last year.<P>
Total revenues for the Pennsylvania 100 rose a healthy 7.5% in 1994 to $208.9 billion, surpassing the previous year's 5.7% increase. Net income went up almost 48% from $5.1 billion (adjusted) to $7.5 billion.<P>
John Frankola, director of research for Parker/Hunter Inc., says, "We are coming off a very good year, following two good years." He estimates that operating earnings for the Pennsylvania 100 companies would be similar to, if not greater than, those for the S&P 500. "The operating earnings for the S&P 500 were up 17.6%. Operating earnings are a little bit different than what we have for the Pennsylvania 100 because we didn't [isolate] non-recurring items. But I would guess that the operating earnings for the Pennsylvania 100 are in the 20% to 30% range."<P>
Like last year, Parker/Hunter compiled this year's list using "as reported" figures instead of those with extraordinary charges and income removed.<P>
Frankola says that one reason why Pennsylvania companies did so well was because cyclical companies did well, and the Pennsylvania 100 has a plethora of those. 
"It was a good year for cyclical companies, which is a trend we see developing with the overall economy strengthening. Steel, other metals like Alcoa, chemicals - most of those companies are cyclical and had revenues and earnings above average," says Frankola.<P>
For proof, he points to the double-digit revenue growth of Alcoa, PPG, Bethlehem Steel and AMP, all mature companies in the top 25.<P>
Other large companies, which often don't grow as rapidly as smaller companies, had revenue growth above recent historical rates. "USX had 7% growth in revenues," says Frankola, adding that Sun had 5% growth, which is an improvement over its five-year rate of about 1%.<P>
What's helping is a steel boomlet that's been underway, a relatively unheard of phenomenon since the late 1970s. Demand from U.S. manu-facturers last year caused steel consumption to jump to 108 million tons, a 3% increase over 1993. Prices rose 9%.<P>
Of course, that's good news for Pennsylvania, a steelmaker hub. For U.S. Steel, it meant the highest quarterly shipments in more than five years. The company shipped over 2.9 million tons in fourth quarter 1994 from three primary facilities. U.S. Steel shipped some 10.6 million tons total in 1994, and expects to send off 12.5 million net tons this year.<P>
"We expect average 1995 raw steel production to exceed 1994 levels, reflecting operating improvements successfully implemented by the steel group," says USX board chairman, Charles Corry.<P>
Bethlehem Steel enjoyed similar success. "This is the first time Bethlehem has been profitable for the full year since 1989," says Curtis Barnette, chairman and CEO. Bethlehem shipped 9.3 million tons in 1994, up 3%.<P>
Some others in the steel category also did well. Lukens posted a 9.8% growth in revenues, as did J&L Specialty. Armco is a notable exception in the steel category, as it leads the Pennsylvania 100 in revenue decline with a -13.6% change from its 1993 performance.<P>
Allegheny Ludlum, which experi-enced its first-ever labor strike in 1994, bounced back by year-end, shipping a record level of 156,000 tons of product in the final quarter. Rich Sporrer of Parker/Hunter's research department continues to recommend the purchase of ALS for long-term investors. "In 1995, we expect ALS to benefit from continuing strong demand for stainless products, reduced competition from imported steels and year-over-year price hikes of 5% to 10%," says Sporrer.
Thirty-two percent of the companies in the top 25 had double-digit growth, Frankola notes. For the remaining 75 companies, 44% had growth of 10% or more. Only 14% of the Pennsylvania 100 had revenues that were lower than their previous year's.<P>

<font size =+2><B>Good On Paper</B></font size> 
Of the top 25, Alco Standard had the highest growth in revenues, up 24%. The company is one of the largest U.S. distributors of paper products. Alco Standard is also a growing distri-butor of office products and a manu-facturer of food service equipment.<P>
It's the office angle that intrigues Frankola. "When the economy is good, we are all passing paper more," he notes. "Alco is also in office equipment leasing, selling and servicing." The increased use of and demand for office equipment, such as fax machines, low-cost copiers and color copiers, bodes well for companies in that industry, Frankola says.<P>
Revenues for Alco Office Products were up 41.3% to $2.2 billion, and operating income advanced 43.7% to $199.4 million. The growth reflects a record number of companies acquired in 1994. Excluding those purchases, Alco Office Products revenues increased 14% and operating income rose 24%. The company's other business group, Unisource, increased revenues 18.3% to $5.8 billion.<P>
"The past year was one of the most significant in Alco Standard's 29-year history," says John Stuart, president and CEO. "Internal growth, combined with a strong acquisition program, will sustain our overall growth rate through 1995 and beyond."
No. 82 on the Pennsylvania 100, Hunt Manufacturing, is also in the office product and supply business. The maker of X-acto brand knives had record net sales of $288 million for the year ending Nov. 27, 1994. The 95-year-old company saw office furniture sales grow by 17%, and sales of desktop accessories and supplies increase 13%.<P>

<font size =+2><B>Another Office Leader</B></font size> 
"It's interesting to note that the company in the top 25 with the second largest jump in revenues was Intelligent Electronics. That also reflects the office automation trend," comments Frankola.<P>
Intelligent Electronics is one of the nation's largest distributors of computer products and services with approxi-mately 1,700 franchised stores in the United States and Canada, according to "The Emerald/Home State Guide to Pennsylvania Business." Among its stores are those operating under the names Todays Computer Business, Entre Computer Centers and Connect-ing Point of America. (The company sold its BizMart division for $265 million in 1993.)<P>
Intelligent Electronics posted reve-nue growth of 18.2% from 1993 to 1994. <P>
It's likely that more of the company's income will be paid out to law and advertising firms this year than was anticipated. The company was taken to task in The Wall Street Journal for using marketing funds from suppliers, a practice Intelligent Electronics considers fundamental in its industry. Other business practices were also questioned in the article, which was based in part on a lawsuit by a former employee.<P>
The article touched off a spate of media coverage and more lawsuits to which Intelligent Electronics responded with a full-page ad in the journal in January. In it, Richard Sanford, chairman and CEO, indicated that the company expects its position to be upheld and invited doubting Thomases to learn more about the company by calling or writing.<P>
Prior to the company's third quarter 1994 results, Intelligent Electronics had announced a plan to transform the company into a leaner, more efficient organization.<P>
"Actions have been taken to exercise control in a challenging operating environment, including the installation of new systems. While these measures are commencing, we cannot expect instant gratification," says Sanford. "We expect recurring costs associated with transformation and continued inefficiencies until the switch over to our new systems is accomplished."<P>
Intelligent Electronics certainly is not alone in its quest to "transform" to remain competitive. It seems that any company that didn't restructure in 1993 or earlier did so (or announced it would) in 1994. Hershey Foods' restructuring plan is expected to produce $15 million to $20 million annually in pre-tax savings by next year.<P>
Scott Paper Co. implemented a major restructuring plan under new chairman and CEO Albert Dunlap. Dunlap has been shedding employees, business units and even Scott's headquarters to improve profitability. The company, which called Phila-delphia home for 115 years, is pulling up stakes for Boca Raton, Fla.<P>
Significant downsizing continued for many companies on the Pennsyl-vania 100. Westinghouse, for example, took a fourth quarter "pre-tax restructuring charge of $71 million, primarily associated with 1,200 additional employee separations that extend beyond our previously announced headcount reductions of 6,000," according to Mike Jordan, chairman and CEO.<P>
Unisys eliminated more than 4,000 positions worldwide, creating an annual savings in excess of $200 million. A small consolation for those let go perhaps: the bonus for Unisys chairman and CEO, James Unruh, was halved to $420,000 based on disappointing 1994 results. (Unruh's 1994 salary was up 3% to $792,336.)<P>
PECO Energy instituted voluntary retirement and separation incentive programs, estimated to save $60 million per year by 1996 after taxes. And, Bethlehem Steel announced that it will lay off another 1,700 workers at its Bethlehem plant. From 1984 to 1994, Bethlehem has reduced its work force by 63%.<P>
Another industry standout for Frankola, in addition to steel and office supplies, was healthcare. "For the last couple of years, we talked about healthcare being strong, but last year, the stocks tanked," says Frankola. "This year, we're seeing a return of stock prices in healthcare."<P>
The threat of healthcare legislation led many in the industry to search out alliances, mergers and acquisitions.<P>
Interestingly, almost every healthcare-related company in the Pennsylvania 100 enjoyed revenue growth, much of it double-digit. The largest on the list, managed care company U.S. Healthcare, had a 12.4% increase. And the company with the highest increase in revenues of all, Genesis Health Ventures, is considered an innovator in the delivery of geriatric healthcare.<P>
Amsco, a surgical products and services company, was the one exception. However, the company is in the midst of a turnaround under the leadership of the new president and CEO, Dan Barry.<P>

<font size =+2><B>Interest Rate Factor</B></font size> 
What the future holds is anybody's guess. Some economic indicators have been positive - inflation has been checked by the Federal Reserve's campaign of hiking up interest rates - however, the Fed must make sure that rates are just right. Interest rates that are too high will discourage consumer and corporate spending, effectively ending the economy's expansion. And, interest rate hikes can negatively impact cyclical companies, the very ones enjoying some recovery in 1994.<P>
Economic statistics released in early 1995 indicate that growth has slowed. In February, jobless claims increased; retail sales soured; inventories began to rise, and auto demand started to drop.<P>
Companies are also now facing an increased merger and acquisition climate, a more litigious environment and changes in international markets. Most of the nine companies that appeared on last year's list but are missing this year are gone because they've been acquired by out-of-state companies. At least 31% of the Pennsylvania 100 companies partici-pated in an acquisition, divestiture (or both) in 1994.<P>
And manufacturers are losing some of their optimism. A March 1995 survey by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia indicated that expectations of future expansion of manufacturing have diminished markedly over the past several months.<P>
That's not particularly encouraging for Pennsylvania. "We're still manufactur-ing and industry based," Frankola says. <P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+2>Office Systems: Outfitting the Home Office</FONT></B><br>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Equipping the home business requires creativity, especially when operating capital is slated for other areas.<BR></B></FONT SIZE><i>By Anne Louise Feeny</i>
<HR>
Increasingly, home is where the business is. Last year, Pittsburgh was named one of the top 10 cities for home-based businesses by Home Office Computing. "It's a lifestyle choice now, not so much a financial issue," says Beth Terranova, owner of Advanced Marketing Edge Inc., a South Side firm that tracks new businesses in western Pennsylvania. She concedes that low overhead does allow for investment in other areas of the business, such as equipment and training.<P>
Most home businesses start small: in a bedroom or a corner of the family or dining room. For Mina Bancroft, of South Hills-based Mina Bancroft Associates, "claiming space was a personal issue - taking my son's bedroom even though he [hasn't] lived at home for many years," she says. She advises against thinking that setting up is a one-time proposition, noting that her office is continually being re-designed.<P>
Relocation can't be ruled out either. David Goldman, founder of The Goldman Group, relinquished his basement space to his teenage son, to give him more privacy. His daughter shifted to her brother's old room, and Goldman moved into her former space.<P>
After working for an ad agency for seven years, Emil Kuhar launched his graphic design and photography business in a spare bedroom. He soon found his work encroaching into other parts of the house, and realized that wasn't efficient.
His accountant suggested an addition. "It made more sense than renting a storefront," Kuhar recalls. "We weren't looking for street traffic." <P>
Emil Kuhar Visual Communications now resides in a 390-square-foot studio with large windows, sliding glass doors that open to the backyard and 14-foot ceilings that accommodate photographic lighting. Amenities include a bathroom and a brick-faced, corner fireplace - chosen for resale value as well as current comfort.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B> Do Your Homework</B></FONT SIZE><br>
Prior to selecting a computer, Steve Myers, of Vandergrift-based S.J. Myers Associates, researched for about a year. "I knew exactly what I wanted," he says. Myers found two brothers who work part-time on computers, and spent $1,720, vs. $2,555 retail.<P>
Physically setting up the office can present another challenge. Myers, a marketing specialist, hired cabinet-maker Al Tweton to make his office functional without breaking his bank account. Tweton maximized storage and desktop space, and accommodated the need for bookshelves by fitting some over the work space and building another into the desk's side panel.<P>
Dennis Snedden, owner of Time Management Services, shows clients how to manage time more effectively. <P>
 His dining room work space houses a Compaq 486 computer with built-in fax/modem, a Hewlett Packard 4p laser jet printer and a postage meter. The meter saves time and gives the impression that the company is larger than it is, he says.
Snedden makes copies at an Office Depot or a Kinko's, where he can also send and receive faxes. "I keep a file there," he explains, "and pick them up as part of my out-and-about routine."<P>
A copier is on his wish list, which is "planned, pre-thought out and written down, so it's recognized when the opportunity presents itself."<P>
Rod Hess, founder of Applied Organi-zational Concepts, also wants a copier. Hess, who helps clients manage organizational change, has written workbooks and training manuals, and would prefer the convenience and quality control of handling their reproduction in-house.<P>
In business since 1982, Hess is on his third computer - a 486 Columbia Systems with a built-in fax. He recommends establishing a relationship with somebody who knows computers. He also suggests purchasing an extended service contract for the computer. Why? His contract paid for itself when his computer was infected by a virus. "A computer is my livelihood, and I can't afford the downtime," Hess says. Knowing how seductive new technology can be, he advises against "being in awe of all the glitzy options. Expand where you can, find out what's compatible with your system, and be open to opportunities."<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B> Wanna Trade?</B></FONT SIZE><br>
Sometimes that means bartering. "I was able to secure services before I was ready to pay cash," says Snedden.<P>
Bancroft advocates bartering, but reminds those who engage in it to conform to the tax requirements established by the Internal Revenue Service. A former Latin teacher, she provides training in self-presentation and interpersonal effective-ness. Now in business for 10 years, she remembers swapping tutoring services for secretarial support, and later exchanging staff development training for a copier.<P>
In the beginning, office equipment was not a large line item in Bancroft's budget. That meant trying to produce professional-looking letters on an electric typewriter, which was frustrating at best.<P>
Consequently, Bancroft truly appre-ciates the state-of-the-art equipment she acquired at Comp USA last November: a Compaq Presario CDS 924 with CD-ROM. 
In between the typewriter and her current system, Bancroft used a PC and a Macintosh, bequeathed to her by her children. At one time, she used both, which prompted her to buy a printer that was compatible with either - an NEC Silent Writer laser, model 95. For now, at least, she's committed to her new PC.<P>


<FONT SIZE=+1><B> Shop Around</B></FONT SIZE><br>
Goldman found reasonably priced furniture at a close-out sale. "I bought a beautiful desk, two desk chairs, a computer table and two four-drawer file cabinets, plus lamps and all kinds of supplies for less than $1,000." That's quite an upgrade from his first desk - a door stretched across two file cabinets.<P>
Advice on equipment selection and space design is available from office furniture suppliers, like Mt. Lebanon Office Equipment Co. Inc., which is celebrating its 35th anniversary this year. President and CEO James M. Droney Jr. says company representatives can make house calls or look at floor plans for suggestions and recommendations.<P>
Account manager Robert C. Baierl says that the sales staff at Wright Office Furniture in the Strip District also works hand-in-hand with clients, visiting the space and making recommendations. "We can design the office on CAD for them," he adds, "and walk them through it so they get a real feel for what it will look like."<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B> It Takes Two for Some</B></FONT SIZE><br>
Alan Grishman of Grishman Asso-ciates, has two offices at home: one where he sees clients and the other which houses his equipment.<P>
That equipment includes a Zeos 486DX 2-66, a Hewlett Packard 4-PostScript printer, a fax and a paper cutter. There is also a postage meter he bought at a flea market and a light table that he built for pasting up ads. And, a copier that "cost about half-price, because Mita has a Monroeville site which takes copiers in and reconditions them," he says. Grishman advocates having a separate telephone line and an answering machine.<P>
Some businesses that are home-based now, started up outside the home. <P>
After renting downtown for four years, Sally Mizerak of Mizerak Towers & Associates, moved her office to her home's third floor. She no longer saw the need for an established address, "as long as there's a computer, fax, modem, copier." She has all of those in her two-room office, plus a conference table, a TV-VCR for reviewing training videos and a library.<P>
Mizerak and her partner, Cheryl Towers, are management consultants. They communicate via e-mail on America Online.<P>
Although she purchased much of her equipment, Mizerak has found leasing a valuable option. She leased a Panasonic fax and a Toshiba copier with a bin sorter, and even though the leases are now paid out, sees no need to upgrade. She attributes that to having "top-of-the-line equipment. If you don't have the cash, you're better off leasing it and having it, and be sure to calculate the tax advantages."
There are a number of options for furnishing the home-based business. "As a sole proprietor, you have to cover all things, but you don't have to do them all yourself. Get technology to do it for you, and buy or barter to get it," sums up Bancroft.

<B><FONT SIZE=+2><B>Unconventional Care: Is It Growing?</B></FONT></B><br>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>About a third of Americans have sought care from nontraditional healthcare providers. That figure may be less in conservative western Pennsylvania.</B></FONT SIZE><br><i>By Lydia Strohl</i>
<p>
<hr>
Karen Rehder had a lot of pain after the birth of her first baby. The 29-year-old knew there was pain in childbirth. But how much surprised her.<P>
"I didn't know I had so much trauma; I just thought I was wimpy," says Rehder, now 38, who practices at St. Francis Medical Center. What she and her doctors didn't know was that delivery had severely weakened the ligaments around her pelvis.
Her pelvis completely separated more than two months before her third child was due. The pain led doctors to induce labor three weeks early. Delivery went well and she returned to work six weeks later.<P>
"I was still in pain, and I noticed that when I walked I would click and grind, like I was not hooked together properly," says Rehder. "The doctors didn't know what to do."<P>
Two surgeries later, the doctors still did not know what to do. Though the pain was less intense, it was present every day.<P>
"The doctors did tests, which all came back normal," says Rehder. "They said, We don't know why you're still having pain, but we can do another surgery.' I said, 'No.'<P>
Physical therapy didn't help. Through a friend, Rehder heard of Tassos Spanos, a trigger-point myotherapist at the Center for Pain Treatment on the South Side.<P>
"I am like a new person," declares Rehder, who finally found relief with myotherapy. "I get a tiny bit of pain, but nothing like before."<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B> Breaking with Tradition</B></FONT SIZE><br>
Myotherapy is one of a growing number of therapies that, because they are outside of the medical mainstream, are often titled "alternative," or "nonconventional." (See sidebar for glossary.)<P>
It is a category defined by the newly founded Office of Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of Health, as therapies "not reimbursed by insurance, not taught in medical school or not proven by research." Not all therapies meet all the criteria. For example, most of Spanos' work is covered by insurance, since he is affiliated with a licensed chiropractor.<P>
Though this broadness may confuse consumers, it does not dampen their ardor to venture beyond conventional medicine. A 1990 study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that one-third of respondents sought care from uncon-ventional providers. These therapies are  not necessarily new - acupuncture and chiropractics are thousands of years old. Some, like myotherapy, have been developed in the past 50 years.<P>
Like Rehder, 83% of those who used unconventional therapy for serious medical conditions also sought treatment from a medical doctor. But 72% of these patients did not inform their doctor of the use of these therapies. The antipathy between the conventional medical establishment and alternative practitioners is attested to by both parties.<P>
"I believe there's a place for everything," says Rehder. "What M.D.s do is important, but we don't know everything - and if doctors would stop being so arrogant they would see that. The major problem is that there's so much to know in the medical profession right now. And we get no training [on these therapies] in medical school."<P>
One morning, eight months after the birth of her daughter, Malissa Kazmer blacked out getting out of bed. The 20-year-old had been having chest pains, shortness of breath and dizziness. A couple of times a week, her heart rate raced up to 260 beats a minute. Her hands were shaky, and often she couldn't get up until noon.<P>
It took two years and four doctors to diagnose her condition as mitral valve prolapse, an abnormal closure of one of the heart's four valves.<P>
"They made me think I was crazy," says Kazmer. "I got migraine headaches. I couldn't keep up with everyday life. So I went to my family doctor to see if he could refer me to someone else. He said there was a clicking sound in my heart, ran an electrocardiogram and diagnosed the condition. Those other doctors, maybe they just didn't want to be bothered. But they prescribed drugs without even knowing what was wrong."<P>
Over three years, she took four heart medications, resulting in leg cramps, weakness and a 60-pound weight gain.<P>
"They were giving me medications to cover up the side effects of the heart medicine," she says. "I finally got tired of it. Then my mom suggested I see this doctor she worked with at Harmarville Rehabilitation Hospital."<P>
David M. Goldstein is an M.D. who practices nutritional and preventive medicine. Kazmer's symptoms led Goldstein to believe Kazmer had a magnesium deficiency. So he put her on a magnesium I.V.<P>
Goldstein says nutritional therapies tend to be inexpensive and safe. (From 1983 to 1990, 2,556 fatalities occurred from pharmaceutical drugs while just one death resulted from vitamin supplements.) Kazmer changed her eating habits and added a magnesium supplement, vitamins B6, A and E, as well as fatty acids. <P>
"Two weeks later, people started noticing I looked good and had color," says Kazmer. "Two weeks after that, I got off my medication and felt completely well. It's like a miracle." She's lost 25 pounds, has energy enough to perform her job (as a hostess at Eat n Park), attend school (in June she'll be through training as a pharmaceutical technician), and get engaged (on Valentine's Day).<P>
"It makes sense to look for the natural approaches that work in concert with the body rather than going to drugs first," says Goldstein, who opened a solo practice in the North Hills last July. "There's much research to support the idea, but it's not widely known. We're not taught this in medical school. I had to go learn myself."<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B> Slighting Nutrition</B></FONT SIZE><br>
Despite research linking nutrition with health, the number of medical schools requiring courses in nutrition has declined in recent years, according to a 1993 survey by Vegetarian Times.<P>
Goldstein determines a person's nutritional state via a lengthy questionnaire which asks about ringing in the ears, cracking at the corners of the mouth, muscle twitching and other symptoms.<P>
"These are not symptoms you would take to a conventional doctor, perhaps," says Goldstein. "But if you are more sensitive, you can pick deficiencies up early. We need to shorten the area between having a symptom and having clinical onset of disease."<P>
Other critics accuse the medical establishment of far more serious aggression toward alternative therapies than ignorance.<P>
"Traditional medicine is when you get sick, you come see me and I'll give you an antibiotic," says Candace Campbell, executive director of the American Preventive Medical Association. "Our members tend to focus on diet, lifestyle and nutrition to prevent disease. They choose the point of least resistance first. But it's hard for them to advance medicine; they are harassed by state medical boards."<P>
Campbell cites a straw pool done at a meeting in which 85% said they had administrative action taken against them by their state medical board - a request for a hearing to review patient records and practice.<P>
"Most of these are not based on patient complaints," says Campbell, citing cases of M.D.s being raided or put out of business for using unconventional therapies.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B> Bill of Rights</B></FONT SIZE><br>
"We are lobbying for a bill that says, Patients have a right to be treated by a healthcare practitioner with any method of medical treatment as long as therapy is not dangerous; the patient is fully informed, and the doctor has personally diagnosed the condition,' " says Campbell. The bill is being introduced in the Senate and House by Democrats Tom Daschle, of South Dakota, and Peter DeFazio, of Oregon, respectively. "It doesn't sound radical, but it is. People who oppose this say it opens the door to quacks," says Campbell.<P>
The bill protects consumers, says Campbell, by covering only those practitioners who are legally authorized to provide services in a state. Campbell says this includes acupuncturists, naturopaths, homeopaths and allergists. It doesn't mean, however, that the American Medical Association will be recommending these practices any time soon.<P>
"We'd like to see them tested, have the health claims evaluated and see the data shared," says Dr. M. Roy Schwarz, group vice president for scientific, educational and practice standards at the Chicago-based AMA. "Many doctors would say, 'That's bunk,' but we have to allow them to go through some assessment. There is review in some instances, but we find that most of it is anecdotal, not scientific."<P>
Thorough research would no doubt debunk some claims of alternative therapies and make the industry more navigable for consumers and practitioners alike. But getting data is difficult.<P>
"There is a built-in bias in the system against research in natural substances, because [pharmaceutical companies] cannot patent and market them as their own," says Goldstein. "What would be the purpose of drug companies researching vitamin C if they couldn't make a lot of money off it?"<P>
As a result, these studies must be funded from the public purse.
"That's why the Office of Alternative Medicine was established at the National Institutes of Health," says Schwarz. "They have $5 million budgeted for research such as this, but you can't do many evaluations with that."<P>
Many alternative therapies don't lend themselves to scientific, double-blind studies with controls for placebos.<P>
"There may be five or six home-opathic remedies for arthritis, and which one works will depend on the individual's temperament and other factors," says Jane Critchfield, president of the Homeopathic Society of Greater Pittsburgh. "So the group response will be positive, but the individual response is hard to prove because everyone may take a different remedy, but have the same effect and cure."
Jim Bryant, a spokesman for the Office of Alternative Medicine, says that is being taken into account. The office has made 30 research grants, studying acupuncture as a treatment for severe depression in women, whether hypnosis induces brain wave changes in patients with chronic low back pain and other therapies. The first results are expected this summer.<P>
In December 1993, Jalaire Craver began feeling queasy. The nausea lasted into January. Occasionally, the now 43-year-old mother of three would wake up and her hands would be asleep. Her tongue was sore, like she had burned it with a hot drink. One night after supper, she felt a tingling sensation, which continued up and down her back throughout the night.<P>
"I was scared," recalls Craver. She went to her doctor at U.S. Healthcare, who gave her blood tests and put her on an anti-viral drug which made her tired and affected her bladder. "My legs got really weak, but I could still walk."<P>
In July, she had another attack of dizziness and nausea, which lasted three days. By August, she was so weak, with pain in her lower back and difficulty using her hands, that she again consulted the doctor.<P>
"They ran all sorts of tests, for a whole long list of things that they associate with tingling," says Craver. "They took me seriously, and never ignored me."
But they also could not find out what was wrong. She had an MRI, and went to a neurologist, where she passed all the tests for balance and strength in the arms.
"I was going to my doctor's office and crying. I felt really foolish, yet I wanted to follow up," says Craver. The neurologist told her that maybe she should take an antidepressant, and come back in three months. Now not just her hands, but her lower arms had lessening mobility. "It's a horrible feeling. I felt crazy and obsessed about my health. I started asking around."<P>
A friend suggested that she see Martin Gallagher, D.C., clinic director of Chiro-practic Nutritional Associates in Jeannette. At her first appointment, Craver and Gallagher talked for two hours. He did a number of tests, both nutritional and chiropractic, including a hair analysis. He concluded Craver had a yeast imbalance and her spine was misaligned. Gallagher prescribed a 10-day fast to detoxify her body, a strict diet to keep her yeast level down, daily supplements of vitamins and oregano pills, and a weekly regimen of chiropractic adjustments.<P>
That was in October of 1994. By Thanksgiving, Craver began to feel better. By January, the regimen had become part of her life, though she admits that she cheats occasionally.<P>
"But I am so much better. The biggest difference is my mood," says Craver, who holds up the bottle of oregano pills with a twinkle in her eye. "My kids call Dr. Gallagher a freak. But if I hadn't gone to this guy, what would have happened to me?"<P>
Gallagher isn't sure what specifically might have resulted, but he is certain it wouldn't be desirable.<P>
"A lot of people are functionally ill," says Gallagher. "They can stand, walk, move and take care of their family. They're only functioning at 40% or 50%, but by conventional medical standards they are considered to be normal. They'll say, It's stress, learn to live with it,' and eventually it evolves into diabetes or cancer and demands emergency medical attention. Now, the conventional medical system will pay attention, because you can prove it."<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B> Not Covered</B></FONT SIZE><br>
Better or not, U.S. Healthcare won't pay for Craver's care. (Much research proving chiropractics' efficacy does exist, and, according to Gallagher, more than 700 insurers cover it. U.S. Healthcare denied requests for comment.) The family pays about $250 a month out of its savings for her treatment.<P>
This is not uncommon. The New England Journal of Medicine study found that Americans spend approximately $13.7 billion annually for unconventional healthcare, 70% of which is paid out of pocket. Local insurers share the AMA's view of these therapies.<P>
"In general, we practice pretty mainstream medicine," says Dr. Robert Gormley, medical director of Health America. "We have medical school-trained doctors with a fairly middle-of-the-road approach to disease."<P>
"We cover anything that is recognized for its medical necessity and appro-priateness of care by the medical profession," says Steven Jones, market vice president of Aetna Health Plans of Western Pennsylvania.<P>
"We don't see much at all," says Jones. "The primary reason is that it's not accepted by the medical profession. Not many primary doctors refer to herbalists."<P>
"I heard a great line at a medical conference just last weekend: The plural of anecdote is not data," says Cliff Waldman, regional medical director of health operations services for Blue Cross. "We need to be sure the treatment worked, that it wasn't just time or a change in psychological factors. So we use the scientific method, with advanced controls."<P>
Waldman and Jones reinforce, however, that it is the customer designing the plan that picks the coverage.<P>
"We don't deny our members any treatment that is of value to them, just the payment of it," says Jones. He points out that many alternative therapies rely on the individual taking responsibility. "What makes it effective is that they had to dig in their pocket. If we pay, it take as that incentive away."<P>
There is insurance for those who desire the option to use alternative healthcare providers, however. The Alternative Health Group, based out of California, is offering a plan nationwide that allows members to pick the provider of their choice. The plan will include homeopathic, acupuncture, naturopathic, chelation and other therapies, and pay for preventive nutritional counseling. <P>
"They think it makes sense," says  Founder Steve Gorman. "The big risk comes from heart disease and cancer. No one runs up $50,000 in acupuncture or $100,000 in naturopathy. In fact, we think it will be cheaper in the long run, because there will be less spent on preventable disease down the road."<P>
Gorman, like others who claim that alternative healthcare is cheaper, has no figures to support this. But he hopes to prove it. He also hopes to help pro-fessional associations set standards and gather credible data to support their claims.<P>
"Insurance companies don't under-stand what these therapies are," says Gorman. "If I had five years of data and could show insurance companies that they would save money [covering alternative therapies], they wouldfind a way to incorporate them."<P>
Local insurance providers say there is no call for coverage of alternative therapies. "Pittsburgh tends to be fairly conservative; it's a traditional community," says Waldman. "My impression is that there is less use of alternative therapies here."
Rehder, Kazmer, Craver and their practitioners, each with thriving practices, might disagree. So might the nurses in the office of Franne Berez, M.D., Pittsburgh's only homeopathic doctor, who must tell prospective patients they have to wait four months for an appointment. Such evidence is, of course, anecdotal.<P>
One weekend last March, some 3,000 people made their way to the Health and Life Enrichment Expo at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center downtown. They cruised aisles of booths touting everything from super blue green algae to Reiki massage to Baltic amber. They listened to speakers talk about reflexology, light therapy and magnetism. <P>
A table near the door was laden with pamphlets from other community resources: the Homeopathic Society of Greater Pittsburgh, the Center of Light (presenting karmic astrology workshops) and Nature's Goodness, a natural foods supermarket  in Cranberry.<P>
Upstairs was an energetic Gary Null, nationally syndicated radio show host and nutrition and fitness expert who sells books, supplements and other healthcare products. He bludgeons the audience by saying that 80,000 patients have died eating hospital food, because it is so nutritionally deficient. He teases those assembled over the fact that this is the first convention of its kind to be held in Pittsburgh.<P>
"It's amazing what happens - there's a lot of good and a lot of foolishness down on that floor; you get people making all kinds of promises.<P>
"But Pittsburgh, you're walking down these aisles, looking suspiciously at the sunflower seeds," he says. "Now that's bad. What century are you all in, anyway?" <P>

<FONT SIZE=+3><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="../pictures/publisher.gif"> </FONT SIZE><FONT SIZE=+2>Once Upon a Time </FONT SIZE><i> By Linda A. Dickerson</i><P>
An 18th century government cannot possibly service the needs of the 21st century. All of the king's horses and all the king's men created our current local government structure in the mid-1700s. The structure they designed is still in effect today - largely unchanged. Although probably effective then, that structure is not appropriate today.
<P>
Imagine the world over 200 years ago. Electricity was a relatively new discovery, so, of course, little attention to a technology-driven, information-based society was considered in formulating government. Information, when it existed, was processed solely by hand, making armies of clerks a necessary part of local government. Not true any longer.<P>
Challenge any self-respecting business person to administer local government, and 10 distinct offices each attending to separate functions is unlikely to emerge as the recommended approach. Yet, Allegheny County sports 10 row offices, each isolated from the other by barriers imposed by an antiquated structure.<P>
Admittedly, my quest for a county commissioner's seat taints my observations. However, reform is so blatantly required that no one should doubt the need for an unbiased, independent and analytical examination of Allegheny County government's structure.<P>
Led by a man of impeccable credentials, John E. Murray Jr., president of Duquesne University, COMPAC 21, the Committee to Prepare Allegheny County for the 21st Century, is an idea whose time has come. Under Murray's distin-guished stewardship, COMPAC 21 will enable Allegheny County to take a quantum leap forward by examining alternative structures and identifying the ultimate approach to meet today's needs.<P>
COMPAC 21 should be heralded as a major breakthrough for this community. Everything and everyone is reinventing itself. Local government, which cries for modern approaches, should certainly not be the exception.<P>
Opposition to change is imbedded in strong political moorings. As a result, our community does not progress. In today's incredibly dynamic world, by standing still, we are effectively moving backward.<P>
A thoughtful, independent and apolitical examination of our local government can only produce positive results. It will make the difference between change and progress.

Your article, "Is It Worth Going Online?" [March 1995], defined online services as Internet providers. These are not services - they are access providers. What we do at infoWorks is similar to the large, commercial services you featured, including CompuServe, Delphi and America Online; these are online services.<P>
We build the same types of serv-ices, only on a smaller, client-tailored scale. We have established online serv-ices that serve an entire city, a business or simply one or two communities.<P>
World Wide Web design and development and Internet access provision are pieces of what we can do.<P>
Members of our firm are moderating a meeting of regional information and high technology firms to design a centralized information service that will link all regional high-tech firms and information technology firms. Our firm hopes to take the lead in that development.<P>
The local firms you featured in your article offer pieces of what online truly means. Obviously, the field continues to grow and evolve, as does the definition of what online services include.<P>

I'm afraid February's Healthcare Update, "Learning to Cope," is a little behind. Currently, psychologists have a handful of revolutionary treatment procedures that produce profound results in just one session. Some of these procedures can be taught to patients and the patients can administer the treatment themselves as needed. The article made no mention of even the most powerful of these discoveries, i.e., thought field therapy (TFT).<P>
As a certified TFT psychologist, I have relieved stress, as well as its accompanying head and muscle pain, in just minutes. This treatment is painless and can be applied with your own fingertips once your therapist has accurately diagnosed your problem.<P>
Unbelievable? Of course it sounds unbelievable; most revolutionary discoveries do. But as always, seeing is believing.<P>

<I>ER Index is compiled by Doug Thomas, vice president and director of research at the HomeState Pennsylvania Growth Fund in Lancaster.</I>
<HR>
With few excep-tions, local stocks performed rela-tively poorly for the month ended March 10, allowing the S&P 500 to surpass the ER Index for the first time since we initiated the 25-company Pittsburgh-area composite in the October 1994 issue.
<P>
Johnstown America Industries, Cable Design Technologies and American Eagle Outfitters paced the percentage losers, averaging declines of more than 16% for the month. Legent, Tuscarora and MK Rail led the list of winners.
<P>
In total, the ER Index declined 1.89% for the month, and is now up a respectable 6.05% since inception. But the S&P 500, which has been catching up in recent months, did better, returning 1.68% for the month, and is now up 6.14% since August.
<HR>
Legent's new CEO, Jerre Stead, made an extremely upbeat presentation at the Robertson Stephens and Co. technology conference in San Francisco in early March. It was Stead's first appearance at such an event since taking the helm of the software manu-facturer in January. Stead demonstrated an impressive understanding of the challenges Legent faces and, what's more, outlined a clear, concise strategic 
plan for improving the company's fortunes.<P>
Stead discussed the need for an integrated platform approach in Legent's sales philosophy, an extremely clever way to expand into open systems, or networked, desktop applications, without abandoning the company's leading position in the mainframe business. Legent has been announcing a steady stream of new products as part of the company's collaboration with industry leader Hewlett-Packard to develop appli-cations that bridge the mainframe and desktop markets.<P>
Stead says he expects the company's sales will return to the double-digit growth level in the third and fourth quarters, and since Legent is emphasizing its higher-margin services segment, profits should also begin to improve substantially.
Gone are the days when Legent salespeople give away free advice and consulting to get an order. Under Stead, Legent will get paid for every-thing, or the company won't do it. So far, Stead has made believers out of us.
<HR>
Tuscarora reported that earnings for its second quarter, ended Feb. 28, doubled to a record $1.8 million, or 30 cents per share, vs. $903,000, or 15 cents per share, in the same period a year ago. Sales for the quarter rose more than 42% to $37.9 million. The New Brighton-based custom packager is gaining market share and having success cross selling new products to its existing customers. Higher volumes helped push gross margins up 1.5% for the quarter. The next several quarters also look bright, as incoming orders for product shipments continue to run well ahead of last year. Among the strongest areas of Tuscarora's growth is high tech, where customers like IBM, Philips and RCA are all doing extremely well.
<HR>
MK Rail bounced back as its parent company, Morrison Knudsen Corp., put its 65% stake up for sale. The ultimate buyer could be General Electric, the world's largest locomotive manufacturer in Erie, which could find MK Rail's component parts business an especially good fit. Or it could be MK Rail's own Pittsburgh-based management team, who knows the business better than anyone. Whoever it turns out to be, MK Rail has hired the New York investment banking firm of Wasserstein Perella & Co. to assist as its financial adviser. As we mentioned last month, the loco-motive components business continues to be strong, and with the company selling for just about book value and generating strong cash flow, MK Rail could be attractive to plenty of folks.
<HR>
Cable Design Technologies announced that net income rose more than 34% to $2.93 million, or 26 cents per share, in the company's second quarter ended Jan. 31. Sales for the quarter rose 33% to more than $44 million. The extremely good results reflected continued growth in CDT's domestic shipment of cable products for both network systems and automation/sound/safety customers. Despite the fact that earnings came in above expectations, the stock declined substantially, mainly the result of the company's announcement that a temporary reduction in deliveries of Teflon from Dupont could cost CDT 2 cents to 4 cents per share in earnings this quarter.
<HR>
Barron's took a shot at Respironics in March, raising questions about the company's products and whether competitors, managed care and the FDA would combine to lower the boom on Respironics' profits. Most of the issues were old ones and the effect on the stock was temporary. In the meantime, the company effected a 
2-for-1 stock split and announced it would purchase Vitalog, a privately held California-based designer, manu-facturer and marketer of sleep monitoring and diagnostic equipment. Vitalog's annual sales are about $1 million. There has been some insider selling recently, which is rarely a good sign. But we never begrudge profit-taking by insiders if they've earned it.
<HR>
Consolidated Natural Gas laid out plans to analysts and investors to grow earnings 10% per year starting this year, and to produce a 12% to 15% return on equity by 1999. George A Davidson Jr., the company's chairman and CEO, says Consolidated is considering a wide variety of cost-cutting and restructuring measures to help reach those goals, and continues to make strides in the growing unregulated energy market. Davidson says the company was intent on "turning net income around" although he concedes it will not be easy. His strategies emphasize aggressive marketing and stringent cost controls.
<HR>
II-VI Corp., the Saxonburg-based manufacturer of optical and electro-optical devices used in products like high-power lasers, primarily for commercial and industrial customers, reported impressive results for its second fiscal quarter ended Dec. 31. Sales for the quarter rose to more than $11.3 million vs. nearly $4.4 million, while earnings per share rose to 30 cents vs. 3 cents. II-VI also completed its acquisition of the Virgo Optics division of Sandoz Chemicals. Virgo designs, develops and manu-facturers laser materials, optics and coatings for visible laser applications and will significantly expand II-VI's market, which has been primarily focused on infrared applications. The company's stock, which has risen from $3 to $11.75 during the past year, was the fifth best performing Pennsylvania stock in 1994.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Boards Are Starting to Diversify</B></FONT SIZE><br>
PNC Bank Corp. has elected Dianna L. Green, senior vice president of administrative services for Duquesne Light Co., to its board of directors. Green is not the first woman to be appointed a director, nor is she even the first African-American woman named to the board. Patricia Clifford, a Philadelphia civic leader who recently retired from the board, had that distinction.<P>
Kalamazoo, Mich.-based Sid Cato, who publishes a newsletter on annual reports, says diversification of the corporate board is on the rise. Based on the number of annual reports in which photos of the board are featured (some 25%), about one-third have no women or minorities at all. That's down from 56% the year earlier. Cato's theory on why there's been a decrease in "white-bread male boards," as he calls them, is increased media scrutiny forcing companies to change.<P>
<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Hooray for Hollywood</B></FONT SIZE><br>
February marked the fifth anniversary of the Pittsburgh Film Office, which has assisted in the production of 42 feature and TV films. Those films have had an economic impact of $158 million, according to Dawn Keezer, film office director.<P>
More than $35 million was spent on film production last year, representing a nearly 100% increase over 1993's figure of $18 million. Five feature films and two TV movies received assistance from the office in 1994. The largest production was "Sudden Death," which dropped $25 million into the local economy and was co-produced by Pittsburgh Penguins owner Howard Baldwin.<P>
Other movies recently filmed partially or entirely here include "Houseguest," "Boys on the Side" and "Roommates."<P>
<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>PA Restaurants Profit</B></FONT SIZE><br>
A survey conducted by Restaurant Advisory Services of Wayne, Pa., found that the majority of eating places across the state are profitable and that profitability is directly related to sales volume.<P>
"More than 67% of participating restaurants report they are making money," says Ron Gorodesky, president of the RAS, which conducted "Pennsylvania Restaurant Operations 1994" in conjunction with the Pennsylvania Restaurant Association. "Those making the most money - an average of 8.5% before taxes - report annual sales volumes of $2 million and over," he adds.<P>
The survey groups restaurants by six menu themes: sandwich/hamburger, steak/seafood, Italian/pizza, continental, American/regional and diner. Results showed that steak and seafood restaurants took a 6.2% loss in revenue and a 17.3% loss of income from the previous year. The biggest gainers were restaurants in the Italian/pizza category - collectively they boasted a 5.7% revenue increase and a 1.2% profit growth.<P>
<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>New Business</B></FONT SIZE><br>
Perkins Eastman Architects of New York has opened an office in Pittsburgh. Cafe Biscotti, which plans on franchising by February 1996, has opened in Beechview. Franklin, Pa.-based Seneca Printing is opening a Pittsburgh office. Wellesley, Mass.-based EG&G Inc. has formed EG&G Environmental Inc. in Pittsburgh. Philadelphia-based Schnader, Harrison, Segal & Lewis opened an office in Washington, Pa. Phoenix Treatment Center, an outpatient substance abuse treatment facility, has opened downtown. Butler-based Frank N. Cicco Custom Tailor has opened in the Westin William Penn, also downtown.<P>

In the 1995 Pittsburgh Addy Awards Program, which appeared in the March issue, Joan Gaul should have been listed as the writer for the Heinz Memorial Chapel Book. Also, incorrect phone numbers for Seven Springs Golf Course, Southpointe Golf Club, Mystic Rock and The Woodlands Golf Links appeared in the March Pittsburgh Golf section. The correct numbers are as follows: <BR>
1 (800) 452-2223 for Seven Springs, (412) 746-2950 for Southpointe, <BR>
1 (800) 422-2736 for Mystic Rock and  1 (800) 422-2736 for  The Woodlands.

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Retirement Plan for Small Businesses - A Simple Solution</B></FONT SIZE> <BR>
<i> By Robert A. Shoaf</i><p>

In today's environment, employ-ers must offer an excellent retirement plan to attract and retain quality employees.<P>
However, all plans are not alike and each has its own distinct advantages and disadvantages. Plans differ in important ways, such as who makes the contributions, how they are taxed, and how much money can go into the plan each year.<P>
Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) and Salary Reduction SEP (SAR/SEP) plans are excellent choices for smaller firms seeking a cost-effective, simple retirement plan. These plans require only minimal administration and paperwork, unlike other retirement plans such as 401(k)s. Also, both plans permit employees to save for retire-ment while reducing current taxes.<P>
SEP and SAR/SEP plans would be suitable for smaller corporations, 
S corporations, nonprofit organizations (SEP only), partnerships and sole proprietorships. The employer must have 25 or fewer eligible employees at all times during the preceding year to use the salary reduction feature.<P>
The major difference between the SEP and the SAR/SEP is that SEP plans feature employer contributions only, whereas in a SAR/SEP, the employees can contribute on a pre-tax basis to their retirement plans in addition to optional employer contributions .<P>
Eligibility requirements for both plans are relatively simple: The employer must include employees who have attained age 21, worked three or more of the last five preceding years and have annual compensation of at least $396.<P>
As to plan contributions, the SEP maximum limit for the employer is 15% of each participant's W-2 compen-sation, not to exceed $30,000. The overall limit includes employer basic and salary reduction contributions. Regarding the SAR/SEP contributions, salary reduction contributions are limited to 15% of each participant's 
W-2 compensation, not to exceed $9,240. This figure is adjusted each year, based upon the cost of living index.<P>
Salary reduction amounts in SAR/SEP plans may be limited for highly compensated employees, as determined by a nondiscrimination test required by the Internal Revenue Service. <P>
Setup and funding of these plans should be done on or before the employer's tax filing deadline, plus extensions. Contributions will still be deducted on the prior year's return. A SEP may be maintained on a calendar or fiscal year basis, while SAR/SEPs are generally maintained on a calendar year basis. Depending upon the plan custodian and the employer's restric-tions, plan participants can choose from a narrow range or a wide spectrum of investments in which to place their retirement assets. Investment choices would be limited to those approved by the IRS for individual retirement accounts, which would include most mainstream investment vehicles. The ability to diversify among various investment classes is a feature of many plans.<P>
The benefits of SEP and SAR/SEP plans are many, both for the employer and the employee. For example, on a business tax basis, the money employers contribute for their employees is deducted from their taxable business profits, thereby reducing the company's federal tax liability.<P>
Besides providing retirement in-come, the plan has significant tax advantages for both the employer and employee. Contributions to the plan made by the employer are tax deductible on the tax return of the business. All salary reduction contri-butions made by the employees are made on a pre-tax basis. Also, all earnings on the investments are not subject to tax until withdrawn by the participant. Over time, tax deferred compounding can provide higher investment returns compared to taxable investments.<P>
Some other key points to consider are that all contributions are invested into separate IRAs for each employee and that employers can change their SEP contribution to suit their cash flow. The amount contributed can vary from year to year and, in fact, the employer can skip a year altogether.<P>
Costs are low with a SEP or SAR/SEP as no IRS approval is required and no annual form 5500 has to be filed with the IRS or the Department of Labor. This is in direct contrast to a 401(k) plan, which requires both, plus typically sizable annual administrative charges.<P>
These plans can increase revenue for the company as well, since employees are the key to revenue. An employer-sponsored plan is a way to hire and retain quality employees by giving them a valuable retirement benefit while decreasing the employer's federal tax obligation. Smaller firms that do not have a retirement plan should seriously consider the many advantages of SEP and SAR/SEP plans, as a benefit to both the employer and the employee.<P>

1995 Three Rivers Environmental Awards<P>
<HR>
 PENNSYLVANIA ENVIRONMENTAL COUNCIL AND DUQUESNE LIGHT COMPANY RECOGNIZE LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL ACHIEVEMENTS<P>

Second Three Rivers Environmental Awards Honor 29 Western Pennsylvania People and Organizations<P>

Some define a generation as 25 years--and last month marked the 25th annual celebration of Earth Day. <P>
That means the spirit of Earth Day--a legacy of environmental stewardship--is being passed on to a new generation of Americans.<P>
<img align=left hspace=5 src="../pictures/0595.Supplement.pict.1.gif">	And, in fact, we can see this happening every day, in schools across Western Pennsylvania. Our children and grandchildren are learning about such environmental issues as recycling, clean water, and endangered species as part of their schoolwork--and even kindergarten-aged children appreciate the need to protect our vital natural resources.<P>
	It's fitting that we're teaching our children to safeguard these resources. After all, our children represent one of the most important reasons that    we act as environmental stewards, whether we're recycling aluminum cans at home or complying with environmental regulations in our work. In either case, our common goal is to create a better world for our children.<P>


<font size =+2><B>The Three Rivers Environmental Awards</B></font size><BR>
Together, the Pennsylvania Environmental Council and Duquesne Light Company established the Three Rivers Environmental Awards in 1994 to honor local individuals and organizations for their demonstrated commitment to environmental excellence, leadership, and accomplishment.<P>
	The 1995 awards, which helped to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Earth Day, were held last month at the Pittsburgh Vista Hotel. Twenty-nine local people and organizations competed for top honors as finalists in 10 categories--including business; education; community groups; government; communication; and planning, design, and development.<P>
	Recognizing the important role of children in protecting our natural resources, the event this year focused on the relationship between children and the environment.<P>
	Once again, chairpersons for this year's program  were Joanne R. Denworth, president of the Pennsylvania Environmental Council, and Wesley W. von Schack, chairman and chief executive officer of Duquesne Light Company.<P>
	 "We are very pleased that these 29 outstanding finalists and winners serve as excellent examples for       all of Western Pennsylvania," said Denworth of the Pennsylvania Environmental Council. "After all, our     goal in creating these awards was to encourage others     to emulate their achievements--bringing environmental benefits to all of Western Pennsylvania."<P>
	"Our honorees represent people and organizations from all walks of life who have recognized their environmental responsibilities--and are living up to those responsibilities every day," said Duquesne Light's von Schack. "They are setting the standard for this region, and we're proud to salute their accomplishments."<P>
	The 1995 Three Rivers Environmental Awards competition was open to individuals and organizations from throughout Western Pennsylvania.<P>

Acid mine drainage is our state's greatest source of water pollution. In fact, more than 1,000 miles of Pennsylvania's rivers and streams suffer the effects of our industrial past. But the Environmental Technology Group of the US Bureau of Mines' Pittsburgh Research Center is solving this problem--while also restoring our disappearing wetlands. The Group has developed a method to construct wetlands at active and abandoned mines--using cat tails, limestone drains, and natural bacteria to neutralize contaminants. The method has been named "Best Available Technology" by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources, and the Group has won a Stewardship Award from the US Secretary of the Interior. To date, more than 250 wetlands have been constructed in Western Pennsylvania through the Group's efforts.<P>

A survey in 1991, sponsored by the Washington County Groundwater Coalition, showed that few local residents knew what groundwater was--let alone how to protect it. In response, the Coalition began a communication program to increase public awareness    of groundwater quality and related issues. Informational pamphlets, displays, workshops, and free water analysis all work to increase knowledge and concern among homeowners, municipal officials, and environmental groups. The Coalition also works with 14 local school districts to educate students about groundwater issues-- and this month will sponsor the first annual Washington County Children's Groundwater Festival, for 600 sixth-grade students.<P>

The Environmental Protection Agency has mandated the clean-up    of more than 250,000 mercury-contaminated sites nationwide. Mercury Recovery Services--headquartered in New Brighton, Beaver County--has developed and patented a removal and recovery process to make that task easier. The process effectively removes mercury from the soil at mining, manufacturing, and drilling sites--so that the land can     be safely re-used by future generations. It also recovers  the metal in a nearly pure form, so that it, too, can be    re-used. The EPA has designated this process the "Best Demonstrated Available Technology" for mercury removal and recovery, and Forbes magazine recently named Mercury Recovery Services one of the 25 leading new technology companies in America.<P>

The pollution in the Scrubgrass Creek in Scott Township became a real-life learning experience   in environmental manage-ment and remediation for students at Chartiers Valley High School. Teams studied the chemical, ecological,   and regulatory challenges involved in cleaning the creek and restoring water quality. Together, they developed a comprehensive plan of action and then performed the clean-up work. Today, the water in Scrubgrass Creek        is cleaner, although students plan to bring about even more improvements this year. Through the Project, these students not only make an important contribution to      the community and local environment, but also learn firsthand the challenges involved in environmental management and site remediation.<P>

In March 1993, one of the Commonwealth's largest coal producers went out of business, leaving behind 11,000 scarred acres in five Western Pennsylvania counties. Seventy-eight sites in all required backfilling, seeding, water clean-up, or tree planting--representing a potential multi-million-dollar cost to taxpayers. But John Stilley, owner of a successful Butler mining company, formed an innovative partnership with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources and three independent insurance companies to reclaim these sites at no cost to taxpayers. To date, 19 sites have been restored; the remainder will be completely reclaimed within a year.  John Stilley's company, Amerikohl Mining, has received more than 30 state awards for environmental quality     and innovation.<P>

<b><FONT SIZE=+2> Do The Right Thing </FONT></B><br><FONT SIZE=+1><b>Are business ethics an oxymoron nowadays?</FONT SIZE></b><br>
<i>By Jane A. Black</i>
<HR>

A rabbi is summoned at midnight to counsel a member of his congregation on whether to cook the books and rip off the government, per the boss's instruction, or get fired for telling the truth. Sales agents at a major life insurance company in Pennsylvania and three other states are investigated for using unethical and quite possibly illegal tactics to peddle policies. The president of a small manufacturing concern can't help wondering when an adulterous supplier will begin taking unfair advantage of their relationship. These issues and others like them are inherent in all business dealings and at all levels of the corporate hierarchy.<P>All human interaction has a moral dimension, says the Rev. Dr. Frank D. Almade, interim secretary for social concerns at the Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh, whether it's personal, familial, societal or commercial.<P>"There was a time when business relationships were out of bounds," says Almade. "It didn't matter that 11-year-olds [were employed] for 60 to 70 hours a week. It didn't matter that [they were employed] at bare level wages in very unsafe conditions."Thank God our society has changed its ways on those things. You can see where those questions have crept in whereas formerly they were out of bounds. As a theologian, I think there is a sharper focus that there are ethical issues in business."It's getting sharper all the time. Financial World devoted an entire issue to the subject last summer, and more business books are covering it either by chapter or in whole. Ethics instructors are leaving academia to open private consultancies. Local law firm Lindner & Simpson does practically nothing but provide advisory ethics opinions to attorneys, law firms and corporate legal departments.<P>Why? Are ethical dilemmas in business and industry increasing? Or are we simply hearing about untoward practices more? Some would argue that it's not so much a deterioration of ethical behavior but an increase in expectations. It's impossible to know for sure.<P>Statistics are spotty because of the myriad of imponderables. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates that white-collar crime costs American businesses more than $40 billion a year. Harder to put a price tag on is a more insidious form of swindling -- a poor work ethic. Slackers can rob their employers just as methodically as those who plunder the supply cabinet.
<P>
<font size =+2><B>Part and Parcel: </B></font size> If you use how business is portrayed on prime-time tele-vision as a barometer, unethical behavior is "part and parcel of doing business," says Thomas Johnson in the January 1995 issue of MediaNomics, a publication of the Media Research Center in Alexandria, Va.<P>Johnson cites "Out of Focus: Network Television and the American Economy," which analyzed 1992's prime-time entertainment programs. While businessmen made up 24% of prime time's characters, they were 43% of its criminals and 36% of its murderers.<P>Despite TV's villainous guest tycoons and rapacious bigwigs, small-business characters are almost always portrayed positively on the little screen. Johnson's conclusion? Prime-time TV implies that it is possible for good people to be businessmen, but they are good in spite of their careers.<P>Certainly Americans have developed a pervasive cynicism toward companies' commitment to ethical behavior, a feeling which has intensified in the ultracompetitive 1990s. Motiva-tional mantras borrowed from other arenas -- "Whatever It Takes" and "Just Do It" -- enable some business people to justify behavior they would otherwise find abhorrent. Likewise, many employees have lost faith in management's ability to do right after repeated downsizing.<P>Peter Madsen, executive director of the Center for the Advancement of Applied Ethics at Carnegie Mellon University, likes to define business ethics as having two branches: issues of conduct, which he calls managerial mis-chief, and cognitive issues, or moral mazes that managers must wend their way through.<P>Madsen, who offers training in business ethics for managers, has worked with many local organizations such as Alcoa, Duquesne Light Co., the Easter Seal Society of Allegheny County, the Pittsburgh branch of the Internal Revenue Service, PPG Industries, Westinghouse and Pitt's business school.<P>Madsen is cited in "Making the Right Decision," an extended case history based on the five-year, $5 million business ethics pro-gram of Arthur Andersen & Co., and he is co-editor of the forthcoming book, "Essentials of Business Ethics." Madsen says that white-collar crime appears to be on the rise and that business ethics is a nascent field.
<P>
<font size =+2><B>Sticks and Carrots: </B></font size> The 1991 Federal Corporate Sentencing Guidelines no doubt helped germinate the current focus on business ethics. Congress wanted guidelines for federal judges who were sentencing corporate lawbreakers, says Madsen. "They raised the pen-alties dramatically -- they quadrupled them in some cases -- that was the stick part. The carrot was to allow judges to use discretion if the company had a viable ethics compliance program in place," he says. Fines imposed in one corporate case topped $280 million.<P>That new tangible, mone-tary responsibility prompted many companies to begin ethics pro-grams, or beef up existing ones. Rare, says Madsen, is the large company that doesn't have at least a code of ethics. Some 90% of 235 large companies that responded to a 1992 survey by Business Ethics magazine had a formal code.<P>That's not to say that small companies don't have ethics codes. It's just that their codes are more likely to be implicit and unwritten, says Jim Weber, Ph.D., associate professor and director of the Beard Center for Leadership in Ethics at the A.J. Palumbo School of Business Administration at Duquesne University.<P>"Smaller companies are more seat of the pants -- they are just trying to sell their product," says John Putzier, president of FirStep and adjunct faculty member of Robert Morris College.<P>A full-fledged corporate ethics program might include a statement of values and beliefs or a mission statement, em-ployee training, an ethics committee or officer, and hot lines for advice or whistle-blowing, Madsen says. Ideally, the officer or committee reports to the top brass.<P>"Writing a code doesn't have much impact by itself," Weber says. "The code is a necessary first step, but is insufficient alone. You can't just write and forget about it."
<P>
<font size =+2><B>Follow the Leader: </B></font size> While an ethics code can and should be prepared with input from employees at every level, experts agree that ethical behavior must come from the top down or the effort is all for naught.<P>"[Ethical behavior is] really created by the actions of the leadership," says Putzier, a management consultant. "Lead-ership goes so much farther than a code of ethics. It doesn't do a thing if the boss is a crook."<P>Putzier says he learned much of what he knows about ethical behavior from working at PPG Industries for 10 years a decade ago. "I sat in on a lot of closed-door meetings and never once was an expedient or un-ethical decision made," he says. PPG conducted a major employee attitude survey right after Putzier left. Integrity was the No. 1 response when workers were asked what made up the corporate culture.<P>The vision and commitment of top management, the rights and responsibilities of the employ-ees and the realities of business should all be incorporated into a company's code.<P>That's no mean feat since one of the realities of business is that competitive advantage often goes directly against ethical behavior. "It doesn't have to be a decision of whether to be a good person or be profitable. You can be both," says Weber. "But I rec-ognize the counter position: There are cases when doing the right thing will mean less profits." Indeed, Weber's students often challenge him on that very point, opining that behaving ethically is like kissing your sister -- it's nice but meaningless.<P>Some would even argue that ethical behavior can harm a company, at least in the short term. Denver-based Manville Corp. posted a 40% decline in Japanese sales when it put a cautionary label on its fiberglass products. However, the manu-facturing firm's sales in Japan later bounced back to profitability.<P>Respironics of Murrysville pulled a popular line of resus-citators after some minor defects were discovered, a potentially costly move in light of incon-veniencing or unduly alarming customers. However, its new re-suscitators have two-thirds fewer parts and require two-thirds fewer operations to manufacture.
<P>
<font size =+2><B>Pride Before Fall: </B></font size> Contrast that with the hubris of Audi. The foreign carmaker attributed sudden unexplained accelerations in a model it manufactured to driver error. Sales dipped as the public began to perceive the company as apathetic to consumers. "Now to regain market share, they've instituted a bumper-to-bumper full warranty. They're paying more now than they would have if they had addressed the problem differ-ently initially," says Putzier.<P>Certainly there can be benefits from doing the right thing even when it is more expensive. J.W. Connolly, retired senior vice president for the H.J. Heinz Co., recommended dolphin-safe tuna in the late 1980s, flying in the face of the conventional wisdom of providing the lowest-cost product possible consistent with quality. The result? Enough recognition that much of the industry responded by joining Heinz in responsible citizenship. Not only was it masterful public relations, but the gratuitous injury and death of some highly intel-ligent creatures were curtailed.<P>Ralph Reiland, associate professor of economics at Robert Morris College and owner of Amel's Restaurant, insists that ethical behavior pays off. "In operating Amel's Restaurant, for the most part, I find the relationship between doing the right thing and earning profits is complimentary, not in conflict." As examples, Reiland says better wages mean more qualified applicants; higher quality food means repeat business, and diversity in the work force adds to customer satisfaction.
<P>
<font size =+2><B>Remove the Opportunity: </B></font size> While it's not prudent to hypothesize about who is more likely to be unethical, it does make sense to be aware of certain conditions that can foster such behavior.Experts say that people are more likely to misbehave if they think they can get away with it. Moreover, "people will be uneth-ical if they see it as a way to get ahead," says Putzier. So if the chance of apprehension is mini-mal, and the return is hefty, or at least outweighs the reper-cussions, the situation is ripe for chicanery.<P>Rationalizations can play a part. Employees may feel absolved of responsibility if they are instructed by superiors to do something questionable. "There's no doubt that in-centives to do wrong will be picked up from the top," says Madsen. <P>It can also mean trouble when people are under intense pressure to perform. "There seems to be some correlation to unethical behavior when com-pensation is driven by a reward system. Industries that histor-ically have bad raps -- car sales, insurance sales, brokerages -- are almost pure commission," says Putzier.<P>The trick then is to reduce the opportunities for wrong-doing, Madsen says. Restructure the compensation system, for example. Protect whistle-blow-ers. And, walk the talk, as dif-ficult as that may be.
<P>
<font size =+2><B>It's Getting Worse: </B></font size> All indications are that it's not going to get any easier. "It's clear that as business becomes more complex because of an-swering to the various stake-holders, operating on a global level and so on, balancing different ethical issues is going to be more difficult," says Weber.<P>Humility helps, Almade says. "[Ethical behavior] might be connected to a willingness to listen to other people and a concerted effort not to be arrogant. Humility is saying, I don't have all the answers, but I'm willing to listen to people and, once in a while, decide I have to change.' " And when making a difficult choice, Almade says to ask yourself, "What decision can I make that will do the least amount of harm?" <P>

<font size =+2><B>A Word About Competition: </B></font size> At first blush, the competition of a capitalistic society would seem to promote Machiavellianism, because a free capital market is profit driven. It's not that simple, however. And the alternatives can be worse. Says John Putzier, president of FirStep and adjunct faculty member of Robert Morris College, "We know socialism is anything but ethical."<P>As a businessman and an associate professor of economics, Ralph Reiland has strong feelings on competition as it relates to ethical behavior. "Competition provides much of the discipline in the business sector, and that's basically missing when we're dealing with the monopoly of government. We wouldn't survive in the restaurant business if we raised prices as our quality declined. Our customers are free to choose to go elsewhere," says Reiland. "With public schools, in contrast, taxpayers' costs per student have doubled in the past two decades while SATs fell. Parents are only free to choose a different school if they pay for both the school that they're rejecting and the one they're choosing.<P>"What would be my incentive as a restaurant owner to offer a good product to my customers if the government gave me their money whether they came back or not?" he asks. Reiland owns Amel's Restaurant and teaches at Robert Morris College.

If there is any doubt that there are high school graduates who lack basic reading, math and communication skills, Matt Botsford, chairman, CEO and president of WorldClass Pro-cessing Inc., a processed steel pro-ducer in Ambridge, suggests taking a look at his job applications.<P>Poor work attitude, he adds, is a bigger problem. "Schools need to get people from industry and business to talk to these kids and tell them what's really going on. Books and classrooms are not enough," he says. <P>Rich Stanizzo, business manager of the Pittsburgh Building & Construction Trades Council says he has seen a marked decline over the last 10 years in the percentage of applicants who can pass the basic apprenticeship test. He finds ap-plicants are not as skilled in math and English as in the past, and that an understanding of workplace conduct is severely lacking. "We're frustrated by this," says Stanizzo. "It really hurts our business."<P>With the vitality of a region increasingly dependent on an educated citizenry and skilled work force, such concerns reach far beyond any one company's bottom line.Labor market projections for the next 10 years say most future jobs will require some training beyond high school, but not necessarily a four-year degree. According to a 1989 National Resource Council study, 75% of all jobs require proficiency in simple algebra and geometry -- just two of several skills, say employers, that many applicants lack. This mismatch has spurred widespread reassessment of how students are being shaped for their futures.<P>Though Pennsylvania was one of the first states to try to strengthen school and work linkages through its creation of the Pennsylvania Ap-prenticeship Program six years ago, some local employers have so much trouble finding qualified job applicants that they resort to enticing employees away from their competitors. Edu-cators agree that there is a serious problem, which is why they, along with business, unions, foundations and government, are busy trying to correct a wrong decades in the making.<P>"I once heard a colleague say if a person had left this planet 70 years ago and come back, the only thing he would recognize would be the schools," says Nancy Bunt, managing director of the Regional Math and Science Collaborative, formed a year ago to advance math and science education. <P>Schools are out of step with the times, which causes students to be out of step with the realities of the workplace. The obvious conclusion is to create better communication between the two. The more com-plicated reality is how to do that effectively. One solution: school-to-work initiatives.<P>"When we talk about career preparation we aren't talking about a specific vocation," says Pam Wiegman, coordinator for Applied Technology and Career Development, part of the unit of school support services for Pittsburgh Public Schools. "We realize that for many of the students presently in the school system, the jobs they will ultimately fill don't even exist now. So we need to prepare them to be employees and to prepare them broadly."

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Local Connections: </B></FONT SIZE><br>
Local organizations that have been developing school-to-work initiatives for the region are working in concert with federal legislation -- the Goals 2000: Educate America and the School-to-Work Opportunities acts.<P>In September 1992, the Pennsyl-vania Youth Apprenticeship Program was introduced in certain Pittsburgh schools. The following year, other districts initiated similar programs. In May 1994, as part of Pennsylvania's plan to create a statewide school-to-work system encompassing many career paths, the state renamed the program the School-to-Work Opportunity System.<P>Industry is seen as an integral partner in this endeavor and has been asked to help identify career pathways for students in the region. Namely, businesses will be asked, "What are the skills needed now and who will be offering jobs in the future? What skills are needed for today's students to fill tomorrow's jobs?" The program will expose students to the workplace as early as elementary school.<P>Southwestern Pennsylvania is home to one of eight state industrial resource centers -- non-profit economic development organizations whose primary client is the business community -- selected as a regional coordinator and agent for the school-to-work program.<P>The Southwestern Pennsylvania Industrial Resource Center is cur-rently piloting the program in eight schools. Originally aimed at manufac-turing, the program has been expand-ed to include healthcare and other service and technology industries.To ensure communication be-tween workplace and classroom, SPIRC recently established the Southwestern Pennsylvania Business Consortium for School-to-Work Opportunities. <P>"Industry needs to come to the realization that we are the customer of the schools. So we really should take the more proactive role rather than complaining about what we see as a falloff in performance levels," says Dennis Meteny, president and CEO of Respironics Inc., and chairman of the consortium. "Jobs have changed,and I don't think industry did a very good job of communicating that to the schools. For this initiative to be a success, it has to be a collaborative ef-fort between industry and education."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Doing It Differently </B></FONT SIZE><br>
The Allegheny Policy Council was formed two years ago, spearheaded by leaders in the civic, business, educa-tion and philanthropic communities, and by the Allegheny Conference on Community Development.<P>The council is coordinating a strategic approach to the way the region educates its youth and prepares its work force. Hence, while it shares a common goal with SPIRC, it is unique in its non-governmental collaborative approach.<P>Using national education goals established under the Bush admin-istration as a framework, a number of council initiatives have already been implemented, such as the Regional Math and Science Center at Carnegie Science Center, the Youth Employ-ment Alliance and the Workplace Skills Development Network.<P>The Career and Academic Pass-port, one of the primary education reforms initiated by the policy council, addresses making sure students have a foundation of certain work-related skills and academic knowledge.<P>Currently, different schools emphasize different skills -- a student in Pittsburgh may have completed different lessons than ones in McKees Rocks or Upper St. Clair. But when a student is awarded a passport, in 10th grade or thereabouts, it will mean a set standard of foundation knowledge and skills have been achieved, no matter what school issued it.<P>The policy council convened a commission from business, education, community and government to specify what these core skills need to be.<P>Ideally, students will acquire these basic skills before exploring career-learning opportunities in the 11th and 12th grades. If students have not achieved these standards by age 16, there is still time before graduation to do so. The passport is meant to better prepare students for their transition from school to work or to ensure their success if they pursue higher education in an economy that finds the average worker changing professions seven times.<P>The passport will be piloted in six area schools this fall. Though similar concepts are being implemented in other states, Allegheny County's approach is singular because employ-ers and college representatives are partners in the initiative and school district participation is voluntary. No state or federal agency is involved.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Repeat Offender </B></FONT SIZE><br>
While new initiatives suggest progress in better preparing students for the workplace, they are not the first endeavors created to obtain such results. In fact, the School-to-Work Opportunity System is an extension of existing legislation, such as the Job Training Partnership Act and Tech Prep. Unfortunately, some of the past educational programs designed to elevate basic skills learning and prepare students for the workplace have been futile.<P>Speaking as an employer, Stanizzo feels the school-to-work and appren-ticeship programs already in place have been thoroughly ineffective. He says he has seen young people trained for jobs already suffering from an overabundance of applicants, leaving them single-skilled and jobless. Other programs, he feels, were not very rigorous.<P>Any new initiatives must identify work force needs in the future, Stanizzo asserts. "People have said to me the apprenticeship programs are a semi-German system. What makes it semi is that they left out the portion where people get a job."What makes the new initiatives any better?<P>"What's going on now is not a program. It's a different way of under-standing the task. It's putting into place policies and systems that will respond to that," says Rob Rogers, senior policy analyst for the Allegheny Policy Council and executive director for the Allegheny County Commission for Workforce Excellence.<P>"Vocational education is a program. Apprenticeships are a pro-gram method. What we're trying to do now is put in a new way of seeing the world and responding to its realities. And only if it is viewed this way will it work. We need an organization that will not run a program, but will iden-tify the best practices and translate them into public policy that will then change the very systems themselves.<P>"So the policy council is not about coming up with a better mousetrap. We're about helping to craft the public policies that will change the systems that influence youth and work force development," says Rogers.<P>The emphasis on input from the business community further separates the initiative from previous attempts. It is not designed in isolation from labor market statistics or from what business is saying it needs for a trained work force.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>What Went Wrong </B></FONT SIZE><br>
Though business has evolved faster than education, it is only since the belt-tightening of the late 1980s that the incompatibility between the needs of industry and the product of the schools has become patently obvious. From the industrial revolution through the mid-1960s there was harmony between education and the workplace.<P>Then worldwide competition arrived, and business evolved to meet the demands of a new market. "But schools, which are funded through government and taxes, did not have to be market sensitive," says Rogers. "They didn't have to be responsive to their customers so they are still doing in 1995 what they did in 1950. But by this time the incompatibility is evident, and businesses are absolutely red-faced and screaming that it has to be done differently."<P>Until recently, says Gregory Spencer, vice president of human resources at Equitable Resources, there were still a large number of jobs where people could start with simple tasks and slowly move into more skilled positions. Not anymore. "Business can no longer afford to offer such training programs and low-skilled jobs. From the time someone starts to work you want to begin to see a return on your investment of hiring them. It is much smarter, from a business standpoint, to hire someone who already has the skills you need, or at least have prepared themselves to have ongoing learning."<P>What this has done, he says, is cause everyone to reexamine their role. "Schools are looking at the fact that they have a responsibility to educate students, but that there's really a small percent that go on to college. So there's a large group of people who are going into the work force, and they don't have work force skills. As customers, business needs to go to the schools more and tell them what we need, and schools have to respond to that," says Spencer. "If I have to devote some of my time for that to happen, it's well worth the effort."<P>Even the vocabulary used to describe these educational reforms will play a role. "For so long, vocational education has had a status problem because of its history as a dumping ground for people not going on to college," says Bunt. "Almost no parent would chose to put their child in vocational education. That perception is still there, but now we have a group of students who do not need a college education but need to be techno-logically literate -- and they need to have those basic skills at a much higher level than they did in the past."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B> Hands--on Exposure</B></FONT SIZE><br>
Equally misunderstood are apprenticeships, historically viewed as training for a trade. Now, it is often a hands-on exposure to the workplace much like a college internship. Even school-to-work is a misnomer as it is really school-to-life preparation.<P>Educators emphasize that school-to-work is not a fancy synonym for the vocational education of the past, nor is it just for non-collegians. College-bound students also need more exposure to basic skills. According to a recent report by the policy council, more than 25% of community college students are required to take remedial classes before they can qualify for credit classes.<P>Many of the initiatives discussed are in the planning phase or about to be piloted. Others, like apprentice-ships, have already been instituted in a few districts. "Things are already happening in pockets," says Rogers. "Fox Chapel has been going through a major change for the past year to move to 80-minute class periods because you can't do much integration in 40 minutes. Shaler School District, with its Project Rigor, is attempting to blend work and school in creative ways. We're trying to magnify those efforts and see what policies are successful so they can be implemented for everyone and not just a select few."<P>The question being asked today is not what academic track can we fit students into, but how can all students be better prepared for the 21st century workplace.

<B><FONT SIZE=+2><B>Commercial Real Estate</B></FONT></B><br>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Builders and community officials struggle to protect natural resources while strategically zoning development.</B></FONT SIZE><br><i>By Krista Hughes Ramsey</i>
<hr>

As commercial developments pop up around the suburban Pittsburgh area, few of us think about their prepara-tion. But the planning behind these developments must delicately balance the pros and cons for residents, businesses and the environment. Local municipal officials and builders strive to weigh growth against preservation.<P>Although development does bring jobs and increased tax revenues -- pluses for any municipal manager -- it can also bring congested roadways, increase air and water pollution, and raise the cost of public services. So most officials create comprehensive growth management plans to nip problems in the bud.<P>Such a plan provides a foundation for developers. It takes into account utilities, community facilities, trans-portation routes, land use design, water resources and future develop-ment. Successful plans also consider the relationship of new development to a community's fiscal status.<P>Southwestern Pennsylvania's communities are primarily stand-alone ones with a hodgepodge of buildings and zones in any given area. It comes as a surprise to some that there are parts of the United States where the same ordinances apply to an entire county and developments are zoned by type. "We will never see this type of situation in Pittsburgh, which makes it even harder to keep all ordinances current," says Jeff Ferris of Kacin Design Contractors Builders in Plum Borough.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Obsolete at Birth: </B></FONT SIZE><br>
Few places here have adopted comprehensive plans for growth management that are completely up to date. As rapidly as the new ordinances go into effect, they need to be revised. "Rules change quickly in our fast-paced world," says Ferris. "We just have to do our best trying to keep up with them."<P>With a proper plan, developers face less uncertainty. "Once a municipality's rules and regulations are in place for a particular type and size of construction or development, no one really can afford to challenge them," says Ferris. "If there is an ordinance in place when we submit for a site plan, we have to follow what is required. Most officials are doing what is best for their communities."<P>Although Pennsylvania does not mandate reviews of growth manage-ment plans, it is in the best interest of a community to keep its plan current.<P>To deal with population and employment projections or new highways that may affect their ordinances, many municipalities emphasize continued planning.<P>Cranberry Township in Butler County is striving for continued planning as it handles being one of the fastest growing communities in the area. Plans for nearly 1.5 million square feet of retail space in the township, including J.J. Gumberg Co.'s The Marketplace at Cranberry, are on the drawing board.<P>Dan Santoro, director of the department of code administration, says Cranberry has been working on its comprehensive growth manage-ment plan for the past year and a half. "We are in the final stages of com-pleting our strategic action plan and will be ready to formally adopt it [soon]," he says.<P>The community's accessibility accounts for some of its growth. Located conveniently to I-279 and downtown Pittsburgh, Cranberry is ideal for all development.<P>The township expects its rapid growth to continue. "The elected officials of Cranberry are encouraging and creating an environment con-ducive to industrial growth," says Santoro. "We promote growth manage-ment. It's essential and beneficial to the quality of life of the people who reside, shop and do business here."Penn Township in Westmoreland County is also growing. The township has seen a 4% annual growth rate for the past several years with no sign of abatement. Dallas Leonard, Penn Township's director of community development, and the planning com-mission have been working to revise ordinances and specifications on zoning, sewers, solid waste manage-ment, construction and subdivisions.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Growing Pains: </B></FONT SIZE><br>
Commercial and residential growth in Penn Township and Monroeville is increasing the traffic congestion. Murrysville, located between the two, is feeling the effects of this growth as well as its own.<P>The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation has proposed widening the Route 22 corridor through Murrysville from four lanes to six. Allen Cohen, Murrysville community development director, says that the proposal is being met with concern because it would require 20 to 30 businesses on Route 22 to relocate.<P>The municipality must weigh easing traffic snarls against displacing local businesses. "The East Suburban Chamber of Commerce and a few other groups are looking for an alternative solution to the problem," he says. "PennDOT says they will respond after they get some feedback and hopefully will agree to a less severe plan of action."<P>Murrysville adopted a compre-hensive growth plan in 1990. The plan attempts to maintain the "rural resi-dential atmosphere. We strongly regulate the type of development we approve so that it consistently pro-motes the inherent character of Murrysville," says Cohen.<P>Many local governments are es-tablishing impact fees, which charge developers for affecting the infra-structure. "If a developer does some-thing to affect a borough's budget, this is when impact fees come into play," says J. Roger Glunt, 1993 president of the National Association of Home Builders and owner of Glunt Building Co. Inc. in Turtle Creek. "They provide a feasible means to offset raising taxes, which is why local officials favor them. Development follows the infrastruc-ture, so there must be a means to maintaining and creating it."<P>Cranberry Township uses impact fees for transportation. "We assess these fees based on a development's impact on our roads, or how much traffic it will create," says Santoro.<P>Environmental laws have been put into effect over concerns for hazardous waste, water pollution and increased auto emissions. "Because of the rapid spurt of commercial growth in this area, Penn Township is experiencing an overburdening of its infrastructure and currently is under a sewer tap prohibition from the Department of Environmental Resources," says Leonard.<P>"These regulatory changes do impact development, and we make it a point to inform developers so that they can make modifications in their proposals," he says. "These are minor problems that can be corrected. The benefits of substantial growth far outweigh the problems we are expe-riencing," he adds.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Tax Refugees: </B></FONT SIZE><br>
Growth is likely to continue in the counties that offer lower costs. In Allegheny County, taxes are higher, often by several mills, and utilities are generally more expensive. <P>"Many businesses looking to build and own property are going to other counties because that's where the incentives are," Ferris says. "Much of our work is done in Westmoreland County, which is pro-controlled quality, pro-job creation and pro-small business expansion."<P>Some counties, Westmoreland included, offer temporary tax abate-ments for large projects that bring new jobs into the area. Washington County is doing the same. "To attract new business, companies can relocate to, for instance, Southpointe, and receive tax breaks for doing so," says Ed Zuk, Peters Township's planning director. "This is a successful economic tool set up by the county, which benefits its municipalities."<P>At the same time, officials work hard to ward off suburban sprawl. Scattered development causes more traveling, thus, more air pollution, and weakens the sense of community. It also can burden taxpayers with the expense of spreading municipal services over large areas.<P>Peters Township actively combats sprawl. "Under the Pennsylvania Agricultural Security Act, we have designated the 1,000-plus acres of active farming land that runs through our township as an agricultural security district, which protects it from undesired development," says Zuk.<P>Officials also have divided the township into two regions -- preferred growth and nonpreferred growth -- to steer commercial development.<P>Washington County's lower taxes have drawn lots of development to the Peters area, including Prizant's Carpet, Ski North, Wendy's, the 10,000-square-foot Heather Office Building along Washington Road and Bell Tower Shops (scheduled to open later this year) on East McMurray Road.<P>Residential growth also is on the upswing. The township granted a record 156 new single-family construction permits in 1994. "We have been growing steadily for the past 10 to 15 years, and we are strongly committed to planning and zoning for the future," says Zuk.<P>The township has a computerized geographic information system that allows planners and developers to see topography, sewer, water and electric lines, wetlands, buildings, railroads, loading districts, flood boundaries, etc., in digitized form. "We can choose any area of property, call it up on our screen and determine its specific geographic characteristics," says Zuk. "This tool gives us the capability to assess the development potential of a property ... and manage growth at our fingertips."Bruce Hill, president of Hill Commercial Properties, one of the oldest downtown Pittsburgh com-mercial real estate firms, says that municipalities have begun to look at the big picture. "They're developing plans of attack to combat problems caused by mismanaged development," he says. "Permits are becoming more difficult to acquire, but it's to everyone's benefit."<P>"Growth management is an issue that the National Association of Home Builders has been dealing with for quite some time," says Glunt. "Our position is that growth is good as long as it's handled with reason, balance and logic. There can become a point where growth in a community must stop, and each of us must determine when enough is enough." <P>

Mayor Murphy has proposed a revolving loan fund for residential, commercial and industrial projects costing at least $1.5 million. Ad-ministered by the Urban Rede-velopment Authority, the Pittsburgh Development Fund will make up no more than 30% of a project's cost, according to the Pittsburgh office of the National Association of Indus-trial and Office Properties.<P>URA floated $60 million in special tax development bonds for the loan money. The city will make the bond interest payment with the $7.5 million it will accrue from the regional asset district countywide sales tax. A second fund of about $50 million will be set up with private sources through the Allegheny Conference on Community Development.<P>The URA has applied for a    $6.5 million Strategy 21 grant from the state to help develop Carnegie Mellon University's NASA Robotics Engineering Consortium adjacent to the Lawrenceville Industrial Park. The 6-acre site will be leased by the URA to CMU. The grant will help fund demolition, site prep and renovations.NASA has committed more than $50 million in grants for R&D, admin-istration and operation. Corporations expected to sponsor research projects there include Boeing, Caterpillar, McDonnell Douglas, Lear Astronics, IBM and Lockheed.<P>In other URA news, $450,000 will be lent to the owners of the former St. Mary's German Catholic Church, who plan to renovate the building into Pittsburgh's Grand Hall. The 1854 landmark on the North Side will host banquets, business meetings and trade shows. Total cost for the conversion is estimated at $1.5 mil-lion, with additional financing being provided by Pittsburgh Home Savings Bank and the developer.<P>	In the last six months of 1994, some 650 jobs were created by 25 newcomers to the Bridgeville, Collier and South Fayette area, according to the Greater Bridgeville Chamber of Commerce. Among the companies are AllPak Inc., Bell Atlantic Mobile, Dollar Bank, Grant Street Associates, Kem Tech Consulting, Sears, Taco Bell, Universal Stainless and U.S. Property. PennDOT has allocated  $2.6 million for road work along the Route 50 corridor which should jumpstart $50 million in projects, says Louis J. Phillips, chairman of the Route 50 Corridor Commission.<P>	Johnson/Schmidt and Associates of Pittsburgh is designing Devel-opment Dimensions International's 96,000-square-foot, $8 million center for advanced learning technology adjacent to DDI's headquarters in Bridgeville. Initially, DDI will lease 54,000 square feet of the building, which is expected to be completed by May 1996.<P>	Magee-Womens Hospital is in the midst of an $86 million expansion program. Turner Construction Co. has completed $9 million of work. A $40 million acute care center is expected to be completed by September 1997 and a $3 million medical office building atop the OB pavilion should be finished in December.<P>	Gold & Co. has been selected to handle Bell Atlantic's properties in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia. Responsibilities include the dispo-sition of 20 properties. Gold was appointed the agent for McKnight Development Corp. (owners of the Wendy's and Chuck E. Cheese franchises in western Pennsylvania) for acquisitions, dispositions and some property management. The company is also now representing the office and retail space of the Westin William Penn.<P>	Conrail Inc. will construct an intermodal terminal at the Pitcairn Yard by 1996. The truck-to-train freight terminal is needed for the double-stack train traffic which is expected once the railroad completes its $75 million clearance project on Pennsylvania lines. About 30 acres will be used for the terminal and warehouse and distribution centers.<P>	The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust is renovating the Art Cinema on Liberty Avenue into a 200-seat theater for the Pittsburgh Filmmakers and small live productions and lectures. Bohlin, Cywinski, Jackson is the principal architect on the project, which is expected to be completed in August.<P>	The Environmental Protection Agency has announced it will pick up the tab for assessments -- $25,000 to $50,000 per site -- for 10 to 12 brownfields in southwestern Penn-sylvania. Under the agreement, the EPA will also shield investors from future liability and create levels of cleanup.<P>	The Rubinoff Co. of Pittsburgh has sold I-79 North Industrial Park in Allegheny County to Aleppo Property Holding Co. Rubinoff will lease and manage the 124-acre park, which has 460,000 square feet in eight buildings. APHC plans new landscaping, signs and development of build-to-suit and flex buildings.

<FONT SIZE=+3><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="../pictures/publisher.gif"> </FONT SIZE><FONT SIZE=+2> To Be or Not To Be an Entrepreneur </FONT SIZE><i> By Linda A. Dickerson</i><P>
One of the formidable challenges confronting our new governor is the stark realization that last year Pennsylvania ranked 45th among all the states in new company formations and 49th in the rate of change in new company formations. In fact, the state bottomed out as No. 50 in the Center for Enterprise Develop-ment's Entrepreneurial Energy assessments. We are dead last in our new business kinetics.<P>If the state picture is bleak, our local perspective is dismal at best. This region's rate of new company formation is 25% below the state's average. According to The Enterprise Corp. of Pittsburgh, approximately 3,400 new companies start here each year. To equal the national start-up rate on a per capita basis, our region would have to form 6,500 new businesses annually. We would have to double our local new business formation rate to equal, not surpass, our counterparts across the nation.<P>Our aging demographics exacer-bate the problem, because the 30-something crowd is the one most likely to risk a new business venture. <P>In its "Acorns to Oak Trees" report, The Enterprise Corp. issued a clarion call to this region to create a more nurturing and supportive environment for would-be entrepreneurs. The Enterprise Corp. challenges area universities to lead the region's entrepreneurial charge. By accelerating their efforts to move their technologies to market, universities can mobilize job creation and stimulate growth.<P>The young, enthusiastic graduates of area universities and colleges bring the vitality and fortitude necessary to achieve entrepreneurial success. Potential entrepreneurs are this area's most valuable resource. <P>If we need to double our entre-preneurial output, then let's accelerate production. I agree with the Regional Economic Revitalization Initiative's assertion that high performance manufacturing is the anchor tenant of our economic superstructure. However, we can't have high performance manufacturing without high perfor-mance manufacturers. Likewise, we can't achieve entrepreneurial success without entrepreneurs.<P>Universities and all other community institutions must challenge our best and brightest young people to chart an entrepreneurial career path here, not elsewhere. The medical community is shrinking, so who needs more doctors? Lawyers abound; just ask any business owner. And, the need for Indian chiefs diminished after the French and Indian War. Doctors, lawyers and Indian chiefs are definitely pass. Now, we need more entrepreneurs. Our future depends on them!

Recently Rep. Albert W. Pettit wrote concerning school strikes [January 1995]. His statements compel an answer.<P>To begin with let me state emphatically that I have never seen a teacher who really wanted to strike. That is why the Pennsylvania State Education Association is seeking some reasonable impasse resolution to the collective bargaining process in our public schools.<P>PSEA also recognizes the need to deal with property taxes. We have strongly supported real and equitable tax reform. Unfortunately our State Legislature has not dealt with this issue; has ignored calls for the establishment of a statewide tax commission re-sponsible for creating real tax reform, and in-stead has chosen to debate superficial political solutions such as referendums.<P>Rep. Pettit draws a correlation between teacher strikes and the rising cost of education and alleged failing results. There is absolutely no research to sustain that allegation. As to failing results, certainly there is a need to improve our public schools but indeed there is factual information that argues to the continuing progress and success of our public schools.<P>Rep. Pettit's so-called solution is obviously politically correct for it is directed toward teachers only. Incredibly there is not one mention of the other party to negotiations -- namely the school board. Nor is there any acknowledgment of the continuing success in bargaining in that over 90% of the contracts are settled without a crisis.<P>A responsible solution to eliminating all strikes embraces the needs of all parties and is based on fairness as well as equity. This will occur when leadership prevails over punishment, bashing and political correctness.<P>-- Robert C. Baldis, assistant executive director, Allegheny County/ Pittsburgh PSEA-NEA

It's nice to see that Executive Report is now online, and with a very attractive interface. But I thought it was curious that Jane Black's very learned "Editor's Note" [December 1994] included no mention of the fact that graduate students from Carnegie Mellon assisted you in creating a World Wide Web site for the magazine. Why not?<P>-- William Thomas, director of publications, Carnegie Mellon University GSIA, Pittsburgh, bt16@andrew.cmu.edu
<P>
<I>Editor's note: We were remiss. The graduate students in Daniel Boyarski's communication and design programs at CMU who helped design Executive Report Online include: Molly Bigelow, Michael Cytrynowicz, Shannon Ford, Anne Humphreys, Christopher Myers and Bill Thomas. We appreciate their hard work.</I>

<!IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="GuestEditor.gif"> <FONT SIZE=+2><B>The Next Monopoly to Fall: Electricity</B></FONT SIZE><br><i>By Peter C. Christensen</i>
<HR>
On the heels of successes in the airline, telecommunications and natural gas industries, the electricity industry is undergoing fundamental structural changes that will introduce competition to the last of the major "natural" monopolies. Savvy executives are learning all they can about the issue, recognizing that competition will mean significant savings for the industrial consumers who are ahead of the curve.<P>What is ultimately at stake here is whether a retail electricity consumer should be able to shop an open market for electricity rather than be forced to purchase power from the local, native utility. Since the end-user must still be physically interconnected to local distribution and transmission lines, the local utility would have to transmit, or "wheel," power purchased from another supplier to the end-user. The concept of retail wheeling has shaken this normally static industry and will forever change the way consumers buy electricity.<P>California has been leading the charge for retail wheeling. I chaired a conference there in December at which a commissioner of the California Public Utilities Commission outlined its proposal to implement retail wheeling for large industrial consumers by 1996 and for residential customers by 2002. That means that California industries could begin realizing the benefits of accessing an open market for electricity in one year. It's clear that this will attract business to the West Coast. In an illustration of competitive forces at work, I expect a domino effect as other states implement retail wheeling to compete with California.<P>Where is Pennsylvania? The state Public Utility Commission has instituted an investigation of competition in the electricity industry and the state General Assembly has held hearings on the issue.<P>But it is only a matter of time. Providing power from heavily regulated monopolies has worked rather well since the days of the large electricity trusts in the 1930s. We all assumed that electricity was a natural monopoly in which economics of scale applied. However, in the 1980s, federal legislation, intended to maximize industrial energy efficiency and promote alternative generation resources, spurred the development of the independent power industry. It was an overwhelming success.<P>Today, non-utility developers are responsible for more new generation than the regulated public utilities. One survey of electric utility executives found that 44% of all U.S. utilities will never build another generation facility. So much for natural monopolies with respect to power production.<P>The nation's transmission grid and local distribution systems, however, are still natural monopolies. Nobody wants multiple power lines running down the street. Because the major utilities control these systems, consumers do not have access to the newly competitive generation market. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 requires utilities to transmit power to wholesale buyers, such as other utilities, municipal electric companies and rural electric cooperatives, from any supplier the wholesaler chooses.<P>But where does that leave the retail consumer? Powerless for the time being. Federal law leaves implementation of retail wheeling up to the states. As I've pointed out, some have been more vigorous than others.<P>Why the drive for retail wheeling? Because electricity prices are too high in many parts of the country. This is especially evident in those areas where a high-priced utility is adjacent to a low-priced utility. This disparity will not exist in a competitive market. In California, for example, the average industrial rate is 7.6 cents per kilowatt hour; while in neighboring Oregon, the average rate is only 3.2 cents per kilowatt hour. These high rates are especially debilitating to electricity-intensive industries, such as steel, aluminum, oil and chemical.<P>Moreover, they are debilitating to California's efforts, and those of other states, to attract and keep such industries. U.S. industry is rightfully demanding that its electricity suppliers face the same competitive pressures that it does.<P>The success in restructuring the natural gas industry has shown that the market can be trusted to meet the needs of society while pushing costs down and increasing quality of service. Although many local distribution companies warned otherwise, even residential gas prices are lower now than they were before competition was introduced.<P>Of course, many utilities are fighting retail wheeling, and the sheer technical complexity of the electricity infrastructure is slowing down restructuring. Too few end-users understand the industry well enough to properly prepare for the competition to come.<P>However, the door to the free market has been opened, and as history repeatedly has proven, there is no turning back. If properly structured and regulated, competition is a good thing. It's the electricity industry's turn to face this reality and your turn to benefit.

After working for nine years for Westinghouse and Cimflex Teknowledge Corp., Joseph capitalized on the outsourcing craze by putting a twist on home-based businesses: He founded a bookkeeping company where the employees work from home.<P>"It was kind of by accident," he says. "My father needed a bookkeeper for his construction company, so I tried to save him some money."<P>Joseph decided in 1991 to invest significant time and money into his concept. After 18 months of market research, installing systems and training a staff, the company was set to go. "We used some data clients who are friends of the family as guinea pigs early on," Joseph says. "By the time we took it out into the market in 1993, we were ready."<P>Bookminders now has seven "offices" and links each employee via online services, fax, phone and voice mail.<P>"Like any business, we had to do a lot of public relations," he says. "We also had to let accountants know we're not a threat to them. We're not a CPA firm. We handle bookkeeping; we don't do taxes. Our responsibility to our clients is to work with both the customer and their accounting firm."<P>Despite providing seminars on virtual corporations and how businesses can improve through outsourcing, Joseph's focus is on Bookminders, which has tripled its revenues each year since 1992.<P>"We will continue to refine our customers' needs and our prices," Joseph says, "but we finally have enough in place to concentrate on growth. Someday, I'd like to expand into new geographic markets."

Continued highs for the ER Index's two leading stocks, Res-pironics and Fore Systems, as well as the first signs of life from Astrotech in a while helped offset sizeable declines in MK Rail, Legent and USX -- U.S. Steel, and helped the index to a 1.19% gain for the month ended Feb. 10. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 gained 3.32%. Our basket of 30 local stocks continues to lead the S&P by a wide margin however, 8.09% vs. 4.39%, since we kicked off the index on Aug. 15.
<DL>
<LI>Fore Systems, which has risen almost 150% since August to $75.25 per share, announced net income for its quarter ended Dec. 31, 1994, was $2.1 million or 15 cents per share vs. $701,000 or 6 cents per share for the same period a year ago. The Warrendale-based designer and manufacturer of ATM-based networking products saw total revenue climb to nearly $21 million in the quarter, up from slightly more than $7.2 million last year. The company has announced a joint venture with global telecommunications giant Northern Telecom. Fore has also declared a 2-for-1 stock split.
<LI>Respironics gained 18% for the month, closing at $32.75 per share. The Murrysville-based company reported higher than expected earnings for its second fiscal quarter ended Dec. 31. Net income climbed 31% to a record $2.7 million or 31 cents per share vs. $2.06 million or 24 cents per share in the year-earlier period. Revenue for the respiratory therapy company rose 28% to $23.9 million, from $18.6 million for the quarter.
<LI>And Astrotech, whose stock has been relatively quiet since September, gained more than 20% to $3.31 per share on the news that first fiscal quarter income from continuing operations jumped to $659,000 or 7 cents per share vs. $227,000 or 3 cents per share for the comparable period last year. Revenues for the three months ended Dec. 31 rose to $24.9 million from $11.5 million. The company is finally beginning to see some meaningful growth in its core petrochemical and refinery markets. Astrotech also announced its intent to acquire Starco Inc., a privately held storage tank manufacturer outside of Dallas.
<LI>On the downside, MK Rail got whacked again, falling more than 27% in the month to $7.38 per share. The company, 65% owned by Morrison Knudsen, has been caught up in the tragic saga of William Agee, who was recently ousted as Knudsen's chairman and CEO. With the Boise, Idaho-based majority owner in financial disarray, investors are treating the two companies as if they are one, which we believe is unfair. Mike Farrell, MK Rail's CEO, says the locomotive remanufacturing business is extremely healthy and a recent visit to the Braddock Motor Coils division seemed to indicate that. Also, Farrell maintains that much of MK Rail's recent problems stem from decisions that were made by Knudsen people while they ran his company.
<LI>Despite reporting a banner year in 1994, and a rosy outlook from Chairman Charles Corry, investors sold off shares of USX -- U.S. Steel, mainly on interest rate fears. The nation's largest steelmaker, U.S. Steel reported it made $201 million or $2.35 per share last year, its first annual profit since 1990. For his part, Corry expects 1995 will be a strong year, with tonnage about the same, but accompanied by higher selling prices.
<LI>Legent was down more than 18% in the month, to $29.63, as the company turned in another subpar earnings performance. Product sales for the most recent quarter weren't even close to expectations. Clearly, new CEO Jerre Stead has his work cut out for him. Mainframe-related sales still account for about two-thirds of Legent's revenues.
<LI>It looks as if Allegheny Ludlum Corp. has bounced back from a   10-week labor strike in early 1994. Fourth quarter revenues for the specialty steelmaker were up 22% to $328 million and operating income rose 63% to $34 million.
<LI>Sam Forman retired as American Eagle Outfitters president and CEO. Forman was the architect of American Eagle's turnaround from a $9.2 million loss in fiscal 1992 to a $6.6 mil-lion profit in fiscal 1994. Roger Makefield, the company's top merchant, will take over as president, and Robert G. Lynn, former CEO of the $9 billion F.W. Woolworth Corp., as COO.
<LI>Crown American Realty Trust added the Wyoming Valley Mall in Wilkes-Barre and Middletown Mall in Fairmont, Va., to its portfolio in January. Both were already being managed by the REIT. Meanwhile, Crown continues to gear up for the opening of seven new May Co. department stores at its properties. While you're waiting for the May store to hit the financials, Crown's dividend yields 10.5%.

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Prepare Your Return Carefully</B> </FONT SIZE> <BR>
<i> By Paul M. Matvey</i><p>
<HR>
The art of wondering may have worked for Socrates and Plato, but not everyone should be left alone on a philosophical quest. Take the San Diego office of the IRS, for example. West Coast IRS agents wondered why many local attorneys did not file their tax returns. As a result, audits may never be the same again.
<P>
In the course of the inves-tigation, agents discovered attorneys in small firms manipulated their books to avoid paying taxes. Further investigation revealed that personal injury attorneys had the highest   rate of noncompliance in their profession.
<P>
The IRS learned it could collect greater sums in tax, penalties and interest if its agents knew how attorneys ran their businesses. Therefore, the IRS developed specific tax guidelines and then trained agents how to perform comprehensive audits of attorneys.
<P>
A 40+ page book instructs auditors how to do asset searches, going as far as contacting the Division of Motor Vehicles and asking for licenses issued for cars and boats. The manual also instructs the agents to look for anything else of value compatible with the attorney's lifestyle to see what has been skimmed off the income. In addition, the guidelines inform auditors how attorneys collect payments, how they keep records, how they run their offices and what professional organizations they belong to.
<P>
Examiners using specialty guidelines on attorneys successfully collected more taxes than what the computer-selected returns normally netted. With such good results, the IRS developed Market Segment Special-ization Program audit guidelines for other industries.<P>Guidelines are intensively subject-specific. They include:
<DL>
<LI> how to gather documents from third parties;
<LI> sources for industry books, trade associations and newsletters;
<LI> glossary of industry terms, and
<LI> statistics, data, tax laws and relevant court cases.
</DL>
Examiners trained to audit cab drivers, for example, learn how meters work, how cab companies are set up and how to reconstruct income based on mileage and gasoline prices.
<P>
Examiners working with gas retailers are instructed to do a little sleuthing on their own before scheduling the first interview by gathering third-party records from dis-tributors. Does the retailer own or operate a convenience store? Is gas delivered by unmarked tankers?
<P>
Detailed information is the most important prerequisite for an MSSP examiner. Some CPAs worry that during the guideline creation state, the information may have been slanted for or against the taxpayer. For example, based on its studies so far, the IRS tends to believe that pop music stars handle their businesses better than lawyers. Why? Because the musicians tend to employ competent business managers. According to the guidelines, musicians account for cash payments in their gross income, their contracts reflect income, and royalty agreements, press or distribution deals reveal other financial opportunities. Before MSSP, an examiner might not know to ask an artist about such agreements.
<P>
Although MSSP has its flaws, there are advantages to the new program. Your tax return is less likely to be selected for an examination if it falls within industry standards. In the past, the computer compared returns by income level and kicked out items that didn't fall into normal categories. Under MSSP, a sales company's entertainment ex-penses would be expected to be higher than a dry cleaner's expenses, even if its taxable income was the same.
<P>
You and/or your CPA will spend less time teaching the IRS examiner the norms of your profession. You'll be less inconvenienced and you may reduce the expenses you formerly paid a CPA to represent you in an IRS audit.
<P>Also, the IRS, in the future, will better understand the impact of tax compliance on a particular group. Since no one has kept statistics by professional groups nationally, all income figures will be measured against the initial study area. These studies may prove inapplicable to other parts of the country until MSSP becomes more refined.Finally, MSSP will help the IRS identify tax evaders and enforce fair taxation practices across the board.<P>So far, the MSSP has identified more than 60 specialties. They include air charters, attorneys, bed and breakfasts, commercial banking associations, construction companies, eating establishments, the entertainment industry, the grocery industry, healthcare institutions, insurance, plastic surgeons, real estate companies, taxicab drivers and truck drivers.<P>You're wise to suspect that guidelines have been written, or will be written, for your specialization. Call your CPA and ask if the IRS has MSSP segment guidelines for your industry. What should you be aware of? Are there particular areas of concern the IRS will be looking for in your field?<P>Overall, MSSP is a good concept. If the IRS exercises care in writing and implementing market segment guidelines, they will become much more efficient.   <P>Paul M. Matvey is a CPA and tax  partner with Schneider Downs & Co. Inc. He is also a contributing editor of "95 Ways You Can Save Taxes in '95."

<b><FONT SIZE=+2> Economic Development Profile: Washington County: Where the Grass is Greener</FONT></B><br><FONT SIZE=+1><b>Better taxes, cheaper utilities and greener pastures continue to cause a migration to Washington County</FONT SIZE></b><br>
<i>By Mark Sullivan</i>
<P>
The Rib Cook-Off isn't the only thing that moved to Washington County re-cently: The area has been pulling businesses from Allegheny County like a magnet. "Companies are relo-cating from Allegheny County because Washington County has a lower tax structure. Also, you can save on utilities," says Richard Conrady, executive director of the Greater Wash-ington Chamber of Commerce and the Washington Industrial Development Corp.<P>Washington County offers a different quality of life than Allegheny. "Businesses want to satisfy their employees," Conrady says. They can do so in Wash-ington County because the area offers a rural or an urban lifestyle within a 30-minute commute. Also, easy access to the Pittsburgh International Airport makes further travel that much easier.<P>With the success of South-pointe and the plans for the Mon Valley/Fayette Expressway start-ing to take shape, Washington County is gearing up for some long-term growth. "We're looking to get into position for future growth," says Neil D. Bassi, vice president of Charleroi Federal Savings. "The year 2000 is only five years away and we want to be ready."<P>It's not as though people are expecting overnight miracles, however. It will take a number of years before these projects cause a noticeable increase in jobs.<P>Unfortunately, current long-range planning can't do much to fill the void created by the closing of the Cooper Power Systems plant in Canonsburg last November. (See sidebar on page 24.) <P>Metro Petrosky Jr., chairman of the county commissioners, tries to take everything in stride. "Losing Cooper was quite a blow and it serves as a warning. When you work on economic devel-opment you can never lose sight of something like that." But Petrosky points to Southpointe as a boon.<P>Petrosky replaces Frank Mascara, who was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in November. As a county commis-sioner, Mascara was a promoter of the Mon Valley/Fayette Express-way, and Petrosky plans to follow in his footsteps with the other commissioners, Joseph Ford and governmental newcomer Melvin Bassi, president of Charleroi Federal Savings.<P>The expressway has been in the works for over 25 years, says Richard Webb, executive director of the Mon Valley Renaissance    at California University of Pennsylvania. "The section between routes 70 and 40 has been completed for a few years and has had a great effect on California University," says Webb.<P>The Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission plans to extend       the expressway north to the Pittsburgh International Airport and south to Morgantown, W. Va. The finished product will be a 65-mile toll road. Progress, however, has been slowed by court battles. "The expressway would be great for the county," says Paul Stiffle-mire, director of the Center for Entrepreneurial Development at Washington & Jefferson College, "but no one wants it in [his or her] backyard."<P>Some fear that the expressway will ruin existing businesses along Route 51. Proponents say that although the expressway might take away from a few small businesses, the growth it spurs elsewhere will make up for it.<P>Stifflemire says infrastructure is crucial to economic develop-ment and that the expressway will bring the water and sewage systems needed to attract new business.Petrosky hopes that the work on the expressway will begin in the Fayette area in 1996. He adds that "the key to economic devel-opment is access to the airport and Allegheny County. The exit off of I-79 for Southpointe is the icing on the cake for that project. It is one of the first interchanges built off an interstate in this area in a long, long time."
<P>
<font size =+2><B>Electronic Highway: </B></font size> Mike Brna, director of entre-preneurial assistance at California University, says the big news      in Washington County is the increased use of electronic com-merce. "Using computers for pur-chasing, placing orders and accessing business information has helped give companies a competitive advantage," Brna says.Businesses who do contract work with the government now have to do everything electron-ically thanks to a mandate issued by President Clinton.<P>The university has been working with the Government Agency Coordination Office to help local businesses learn the ropes. GACO aids companies by pro-viding seminars and technical support on navigating through the maze of government specifications.<P>Regional businesses have received some $292 million in government and export contracts through the university's economic development programs. Currently, GACO has more than 100 clients in Washington County.<P>California University has also brought technology into the classroom, or make that, out of the classroom. Recently, it launched a distance learning program whereby anyone with a high school diploma or GED can take a three credit course without ever setting foot on campus. The first class, parenting, is broadcast two nights a week on Channel 29. Students can talk to faculty members on the phone via a toll-free number.
<P>
<font size =+2><B>Good News for Banking: </B></font size> If financial institutions were getting grades, Washington Coun-ty's two largest would receive As. Both thrifts had good years in 1994. Washington Federal Savings Bank, the largest locally owned thrift in the county, reported record levels in assets, deposits and loans.<P>Washington Federal recently installed a local area network. The LAN helps the bank provide better customer service by connecting all the offices to the data processing center via satellite.<P>Richard White, bank president, expects the good times to continue. "The increasing demand for business loans seems to indicate a higher level of confidence and perhaps a need to provide for higher levels of anticipated business activity in 1995," he says.<P>Charleroi Federal Savings Bank is also coming off a banner year according to Neil Bassi. "Our net profits exceeded last year and our assets grew to $232 million in 1994," he says.<P>Retained earnings jumped to 13.5%, double the minimum requirement. Bassi reports a 40% increase in the checking account base. In addition, the main office in Charleroi has undergone an expansion to prepare for future growth.
<P>
<font size =+2><B>Healthcare Update: </B></font size> One of the only things more important than money is health, and healthcare continues to    make up a sizable part of the Washington County economy. Monongahela Valley Hospital is the second largest employer in the county and the major healthcare system in the mid-Mon Valley.<P>In the past year, the hospital expended over $43 million in wages and fringe benefits to its nearly 1,100 employees. It provided almost $5 million for charity care, reduced-rate care, public health education, disease prevention and early detection programs. During the same time, it admitted 11,500 patients and rendered 182,000 outpatient services.<P>The county's largest employer, Washington Hospital, has been busy establishing programs for the youngest members of the county. It is creating an outreach program to provide free health-care to children who are un-insured, under-insured or on Medicaid.<P>In McMurray, Washington Hospital opened a pediatric physical medical center for children with developmental delays. The hospital also acquired the Visiting Nurse Association to provide home healthcare.<P>At the hospital itself, a $21 million patient tower should be completed this summer. It will have three floors with a helipad on top. <P>Canonsburg General hopes to have a 9,200-square-foot out-patient center completed in July. The $1.8 million project is in response to increased outpatient surgeries. The new facility will also be the site for chemotherapy treatments, gastroscopies and pre-surgery testing.

<font size =+2><B>Other News: </B></font size> 
<DL>
<LI>Washington Steel had a good year in 1994. Sales and pro-duction were at record levels. "The only negative occurred during the first part of the year when we had a lot of foreign competition because the economy in Europe was so slow, but now it's getting back to normal levels," says Grant John, company president.<P>John reports that current demand is equal to or higher than last year and imports are down. "We are running at capacity," he says.<P>The steelmaker is spending about $23 million to reduce costs while increasing quality and capacity. "Our employment is flat and we are working hard to improve quality internally. In three years, we hope to produce   a lot more with fewer people," John says.<P>
<LI>The Mon Valley Progress Council in Monessen received a $400,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Human Services to improve a building the council owns in the Donora Industrial Park. The council is working on getting tenants for the 30,000-square-foot building. Work should begin this spring. Funds from the sale or lease of the shell will be used to construct additional buildings.<P>The council also owns property adjacent to the Rostraver Airport that it wants to develop into an airport-related industrial park.   The council serves Washington, Westmoreland, Fayette and Alle-gheny counties.<P>
<LI>Washington Power Co., a subsidiary of Air Products & Chemicals Inc. of Allentown, expects to construct a $260 million power plant in Washington County. The plant, fueled by coal refuse, will be built near the the state's largest coal refuse pile in Robinson.<P>Building the plant will create 700 construction jobs and 70 full-time positions with a $5 million payroll. The otherwise useless refuse will generate enough electricity to power 80,000 customers.<P>
<LI> The Coca-Cola Star Lake Amphitheatre set an attendance record last year with 590,063 visitors and 11 sellouts. The $10 million facility hires 300 to 400 people each summer, many of whom are county residents.<P>
<LI> Washington County will be home to a new golf course community called Pine Oaks. The 426-acre site, which will have an Arnold Palmer-designed course, is in Carroll Township off Route 837 between Donora and Monon-gahela. Plans include 270 housing units. Atlas Construction Co. will build the course for Pine Oaks Development Co.<P>
<LI> The Pennsylvania Trolley Museum in Washington is, after 40 years, becoming a fast growing tourist attraction. During 1994, the museum had 19,000 visitors, a 30% increase over the year before. <P>Also last year, former Gov. Casey set aside $4.3 million for the museum's growth. A 37,000-square-foot Pennsylvania Trans-portation Heritage Center is planned adjacent to Thepitt Manufacturing Co. The center is a joint venture of the Pennsylvania Trolley Museum and the Trans-portation & Technology Museum. A 25,000-square-foot trolley display area is also planned.<P>
<LI> A $16 million justice center will be completed in late July in Washington with room for 258 prisoners. The current facility is over 100 years old and is operating at double its capacity.<P>
<LI> Pittsburgh-based STAT MedEvac, an air medical trans-porter, has established a helicopter base at the Washington County Airport to respond faster to emergencies in Washington and Greene counties, as well as parts of Ohio and West Virginia.<P>
<LI>Jack Underwood, director of industrial development for the Redevelopment Authority of Washington County, reports that $35.8 million has been invested by industries at Southpointe. More than 570 people are employed there. Underwood projects 1,270 employees by the time the project is finished.<P>
</DL>
The eight corporate residents at Southpointe are Accutrex, AEG Automation, AT&T, Bailey Engineers, Chem Steel & Con-struction, Continental Design, Digital Concepts and Mitsubishi. Homedco, Centimark and the Pittsburgh Penguins are awaiting completion of their facilities.<P>But Southpointe isn't all business, Mike Donahie, director of sales and marketing, says. "Our motto is live here, work here and play here." The 600 acres are divided among commercial, resi-dential and recreational uses.<P>Golfers began to tee off at the $9 million Southpointe Golf Club last June, and residents have started moving into the three styles of houses. There are plans for 84 townhomes; 30 are sold and 20 are built. Fifty single-family homes have been planned; 15 are completed with 10 more expected by year's end. Twelve patio homes are in the works. One is finished and occupied, and two are under construction."In order for something like this to work it must be done high class, and everything the Piatts have done has been high class," Donahie says. Jack Piatt, Rod Piatt and Jack Piatt Jr. of Millcraft In-dustries in Washington are the developers of Southpointe. Millcraft includes Millcraft Products, Millcraft Mining, Millcraft Invest-ments, Millcraft Center, Global Travel and The Boyd School.<P><HR>Residential Real Estate Activity<P>Washington County	1993	1994<P>New listings	1,837	2,048<P>Closed/sold	1,240	1,263<P>Dollar volume/closed	$126,688,220	$132,540,823<P>Average price	$102,168	$104,941<P>Source: West Penn Multi List Inc., Pittsburgh<P><HR>County Employment<P>The largest single industry in Washington County is services.

<font size =+2><B>Energizing the County: </B></font size> AEG Electric Power Systems Inc. is a newcomer to Washington County. The company moved into new digs in Speers last July. AEG-EPS produces dead tank high-voltage circuit breakers, circuit switchers and gas insulated switchgear. It also provides the North American headquarters for its Stuttgart, German-based parent, Daimler-Benz, maker of Mercedes Benz automobiles.AEG-EPS is not to be confused with sister company, AEG Automation, which has consolidated and moved into Southpointe from three locations in Allegheny County. AEG Automation is a systems integrator of complete factory automation systems.<P>AEG-EPS has kept a tight schedule since incorporating in September 1993. After a November groundbreaking, the company received its first order in December and shipped it by April. In May 1994, it received a three-year purchase agreement from Florida Power & Light Co.<P>Michael Kangas, president and CEO of AEG-EPS, says the business has exceeded expectations. "The biggest news has been our acceptance into the marketplace. For a company starting from zero to succeed in serving new customers in the U.S. and international markets so quickly is very pleasing," Kangas says.<P>AEG-EPS has 19 employees and is hoping to hire six more by year's end. "We have ample room for expansion and will do so in the next four years depending on the success in the marketplace," Kangas says.<P>

<font size =+2><B>Cooper's Blooper: </B></font size>Cooper Power Systems in Canonsburg once employed nearly 4,000 workers, but on Nov. 23, 1994, the company closed its doors for the last time. Cooper was the last American factory of its size to build giant power transformers. Other companies that used to build them, such as General Electric, Westinghouse and McGraw-Edison, abandoned the business years ago to pursue more lucrative fields. In the meantime, foreign companies stepped in to fill the void.<P>A number of factors contributed to the fall of Cooper. One was that American utility companies had turned their attention to conservation and efficiency instead of new construction. The trend was fueled in part by the Energy Act of 1992.The closing of Cooper could cause some problems for American utilities down the road. If a sudden need for a transformer develops, a foreign supplier will need six months to build it and several months to ship it.<P>The possibility of a company purchasing the Cooper site and replacing the 800 lost jobs is a long shot, according to Paul Stifflemire, director of the Center for Entre-preneurial Development at Washington & Jefferson College. "If an American company buys the Cooper facility it will most likely bring its own employees. The only hope is to sell it to a foreign company that won't bring a work force with them. But in that case, workers from all over would migrate into the area to compete with Washington County residents," Stifflemire says.<P>

<font size =+2><B>Centimark Makes A Mark: </B></font size> Centimark, a commercial and industrial roof contractor, is leaving Bethel Park for Washington County. The company, listed by Engineering News Record as the second largest roof contracting firm in the United States for the last three years, is moving its headquarters to Southpointe.<P>Last year, Centimark eclipsed the $100 million mark for sales and seems poised to take over as the country's No. 1 roofer.<P>Edward B. Dunlap, the CEO who founded the company in 1968 with $1,000 and one employee, has been the guiding force behind Centimark's rise. The move to Southpointe is another step toward the top. "We needed a facility that can accom-modate our future growth," Dunlap says.<P>Centimark employs 120 people in the Pittsburgh area and more than 1,100 nationwide at 50 locations. The company could have moved anywhere but chose Southpointe because it offered the most amenities.<P>Company officials enjoy bringing clients in to see the home office, using professionalism as a selling point. "Roofing hasn't always fit into the corporate mentality. Anybody with a truck and a ladder can call themselves a roofer," says John Bugay, director of marketing communications.<P>"When you walk into McDonald's you know what you're going to get. We're trying to do the same for roofing. We want our customers to see a strong company behind the warrantee. A big problem corporations have had with smaller roofing contractors is that [they] hire someone and two years later when the roof starts to leak the guy is out of business. We want to be the first to have one-stop shopping," Bugay says.<P>With Centimark, developers don't have to deal with a local roofer in each construction area. Centimark handles that and provides post-installation care.Dunlap sees Southpointe as a major plus. "We liked the fact that our out-of-town customers and employees alike would be able to fly into the new airport and drive up to our front door without hitting a traffic light."

<b><FONT SIZE=+2> That's Just the Way It Is </FONT></B><br><FONT SIZE=+1><b>For African Americans, the regional outlook is bleak.</FONT SIZE></b><br>
<i>By Angie Mullig</i>
<hr>
Well they passed a law in '64To give those who ain't got a little moreBut it only goes so farBecause the law don't change another's mindWhen all it sees at the hiring timeIs the line on the color barThat's just the way it is-- B.R. Hornsby  1986 Zappo Music/Bob-A-Lew Songs (ASCAP)In the 30 years since civil rights  and affirmative action legislation supposedly leveled the employment playing field, the economic base that supported southwestern Pennsylvania  has undergone dramatic changes. Gone are the heavy industries that offered opportunities and decent salaries to   those whose skills rested primarily on a strong work ethic. The service-sector industries that have replaced the steel, coal and heavy manufacturing businesses rely on an educated, technologically savvy work force. <P> For many of the area's minorities -- a population made up primarily of African Americans -- the demise of heavy industry slammed the door of opportunity shut. Last-hired, first-fired policies left minorities, who had finally begun to claim their places in the labor force, open to layoffs. The loss of high-paying manufacturing jobs represented the postponement or end of dreams that had been realized by the generation of white workers who had preceded African Americans in the area's manufacturing prosperity: a college education, if not for the employee, for his or her children; comfortable housing; the hope of advancing. <P> The University of Pittsburgh recently issued a report that confirmed what many African Americans have long suspected -- that their community took a disproportionately hard hit when manufacturing withered and that they have not shared equally in the region's slow but steady economic resurrection.
<P>
<font size =+2><B>Dreams Deferred: </B></font size> 
Released last October, the study, "Economic Benchmarks: Economic Indices for the City of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County," was commissioned by the county and the Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh. Conducted by Pitt's Center for Social and Urban Research, the study is a comprehensive review of historic trends and the current status of the region's economy. <P> Overall, the picture is encouraging. The report cites low unemployment rates, significant job growth, a comfortable standard of living, rapid real per capita personal income growth and above average real wage growth. Employment opportunities in health, business, education and social services have fueled economic development, although that growth is now beginning to slow. <P> But the report notes that for African Americans, the regional out-look is bleak. Census figures for 1990 show that, when ranked with the country's 50 largest metropolitan areas, the region's minorities are plagued with the fourth highest poverty rate, the fifth highest unemployment rate and the fourth largest gap between minority and white poverty rates. African-American unemployment in the city stood at nearly 19%, while unemployment for whites hovered at about 6%. And while the area's whites enjoyed the 13th highest standard of living compared to residents of the nation's largest counties, Pittsburgh's minority population ranked eighth from the bottom in terms of standard of living. <P> The report calls for further study of the disparities between African Americans and whites in employment, income and standard of living. But businesswoman Cathy Williams identifies two interrelated problems: prejudice that bars African Americans from employment opportunities and the lack of role models for African-American youth.
<P>
<font size =+2><B>On Their Own: </B></font size> 
A little more than a year ago, Williams opened her own business. Crowning Glory Unlimited is nestled in the heart of Wilkinsburg's shopping district and is the fruit of Williams' marketing education and experience and her astute observation of Pitts-burgh's retail market. <P> Williams, 33, holds a degree in consumer affairs with minors in business and sociology from Indiana State University. She combined the fashion sense she honed as department store ready-to-wear buyer and the business acumen she developed as a health insurance executive to research and launch a hat and accessory boutique that recently celebrated its first anniversary debt-free. <P> Williams started her own business after a decade in corporate America convinced her that African Americans are barred from advancement. "If you are African American, you must go out on your own to get ahead," she says. <P> Without rancor, Williams describes some of her corporate experiences. "My first job out of college was as a buyer for a major department store chain. My supervisor told me I was talented and could get ahead -- but I would have to shuck and jive if I wanted to be promoted. <P> "I was the first African American to be hired as a national accounts manager for a particular health insurance corporation," she continues. When senior executives mentioned difficulties in recruiting minorities, Williams began forwarding resumes of qualified acquaintances. "I was called into an office and asked Why the resumes? If you want to work in personnel, it can be arranged. I suggest you concentrate on your job.' It was a nicely smiled threat." <P> Williams left her job after additional incidents -- including an effort to block payment of commissions earned on her accounts -- convinced her of the impossibility of staying. "I didn't want to believe I was a token," she says. "I wanted to believe life is fair, that if you work hard, are honest and have professional integrity, you'll get ahead." <P> It's even tougher for today's youth, who have few role models in the African-American community, Williams says. "In previous generations, profes-sional people stayed in the neighbor-hood and set examples," she says. Today, however, for a host of compli-cated reasons, successful African Americans tend to leave their old communities. "Those left behind are shut out by the system and are either unemployed or pushed into illegal activities."There certainly is an obligation to accept some individual account-ability," she adds. "But there is a pool of African-American men and women, educated and capable, who cannot find entry-level corporate positions." <P> When Russell L. Bynum, owner of Bynums Advertising Service in Pittsburgh, posted an opening for professional communicators, he was nearly overwhelmed with responses. His experience supports Williams' contention that many qualified African Americans are denied employment opportunities. "The talent is there; we found it. But in the communications industry, you'd be hard pressed to walk into an agency and find even 5% minority employees," says Bynum, a man with such a gentle demeanor that it's no surprise to learn he teaches Sunday school. "One of my goals is to run a business that introduces African Americans to this business." <P> When he graduated from La Roche College with a degree in graphic design, Bynum landed a designer's post with an agency. He stuck with the job for more than five years, but in 1984, he "bought a desk and a T-square" and started his own advertising and design business in his home. <P> Bynum and his wife Kathy, a Duquesne University graduate who holds a degree in business administration and marketing, established a number-of-calls-per-day goal and hauled out the phone books. "We worked out of our home for two years," says Bynum, whose agency is now housed in a comfortable downtown office complex. <P> In the 10 years he has operated his agency, Bynum has attracted clients like Integra Bank and Gateway Health Plan. In addition to traditional advertising and marketing services, Bynum also offers special counseling for firms hoping to reach minority consumers. "It's educating the company as well as consumers," Bynum says. "It makes me angry that more ad campaigns are targeted to minorities for products like cigarettes than mortgage services. Everyone is selling something; we just have to convince companies to sell products with real value to minority communities." <P> Bynum's passion is to convince his clients that marketing to minorities means integrating minorities into their corporate structure. "Those companies who realize how demographics are changing are seeking help from firms like ours," Bynum says. He tries to show firms that advertising alone means nothing. When an African American follows up an ad and walks into a bank for a mortgage, the consumer is intimidated if there are no African Americans in key positions. <P> Bynum also wants to put role models back in the African-American community. "African Americans in business must give back," he says. "One of my goals is to introduce people into this business through internship programs."
<P>
<font size =+2><B>Building Networks: </B></font size> 
The goal of building networks for African Americans and women is part of Fran McNeal's dream, as well. The founder of Strategic Computer Assistance Inc., McNeal is a 1983 Princeton graduate who worked in healthcare and chemical corporations before launching her computer consulting business. "I left the corporate environment because, as a young person, I was told to sit in a corner and do as I was told," she says. <P> Her fledgling firm landed an important city contract, then branched out to offer training programs in word processing, spreadsheet programs and other computer programs. Originally based in East Liberty, McNeal moved her offices to Riverside Commons, a restored office building complex on the North Side renovated to house businesses owned by women and minorities.Embedded in her company's course offerings are community-sensitive classes for prospective parents and youths who need skills training. McNeal is also an ardent proponent of internships and offers numerous opportunities for young people to learn on-the-job skills before they venture into the competitive work environment."My original goal was to franchise my business; now, I want to establish a more traditional company structure so I can manage and market, rather than conduct training classes," says McNeal. "The idea is to improve the resources I can offer to my customers, because if my business isn't successful, I won't have anything to give back to my community." <P> For Connie Portis, it isn't a matter of giving back to the community. "I am the community," says Portis, founder, owner and president of Renaissance Publications. A decade ago, Portis established her publishing business to "create a voice for the African-American community in Pittsburgh."Renaissance Publications publishes a weekly newspaper, an annual black business directory and Renaissance Too, a magazine that focuses on issues of interest to the minority community. Portis studied mass communications in Washington, D.C., and worked as a public relations consultant for several agencies in the D.C. area before moving back to Pittsburgh. <P> The Pitt report, says Portis, was no surprise. "It's something that we in the African-American community knew," she says. "I hope the majority community will now act and take some ownership in the problem. <P> "There are all kinds of reasons," she continues. "Part of the problem is racism; part is a lack of direction in education; part is a reluctance on the part of the majority to understand what African Americans bring to the table and to see the value of cultural diversity in the work force. Equal opportunity means equal opportunity for everyone," Portis says. "We must have a holistic view and see that differences are positive, not negative. Unfortunately, most African Americans are still fighting to be equal." <P> For entrepreneurs, equality has yet to reach the financial community. In addition to much-publicized reports about prejudice in granting mortgages, the banking industry may be discriminating against minority members seeking business loans. "We went to Pittsburgh's major banks for a loan," says Jacek Ghosh, administrator for Bidco, a nonprofit arm of the Bidwell Training Center that works with entrepreneurs and runs a food service operation. "We were armed with multiyear, multimillion dollar food service contracts for the Carnegie Science Center and the employees' cafeteria at the Pittsburgh International Airport plus a debt-free $7 million facility [the Bidwell Training Center] as security," he says. Bidco was seeking a modest loan to buy equipment for two new food service contracts but was dismissed by the region's leading banks. "There's a whole informal set of presumptions about minority enterprises," says Ghosh. "Minority businesses find it difficult to get capital."

<font size =+2><B>Seeking Balance: </B></font size> 
Not everyone can or should start a business, but for minorities seeking traditional employment, the picture is a complicated mix of economics, attitudes and broad-based social issues. Rich Stanizzo, business manager of the Pittsburgh Building & Construction Trades Council, says his organization has struggled to balance opportunity, jobs and necessary skills. <P> The council represents 26 unionized construction trade groups, including carpenters, electricians, plumbers and iron workers. Apprentice programs in these trades pay well, averaging $8 to $10 per hour during an apprentice period that includes free schooling. After completing a four- to five-year apprenticeship program, workers become journeymen union members and can anticipate wages from about $15 to $20 per hour.All apprentice program openings are posted through area job banks, schools and minority community organizations. Stanizzo says he is puzzled by the relatively low percentage of minority youth who apply for apprenticeships. "I can't even hazard a guess," he says. "We do our best to notify the minority community, and I just don't know why we're not getting more applicants." <P> But there's one thing Stanizzo is sure of -- the segment of the applicant pool that can pass the basic apprenticeship test has shrunk noticeably in the last decade. Those applying for union apprenticeships must be able to pass a basic math and language skills test, and fewer and fewer applicants are able to do so, Stanizzo says. "Young people just aren't graduating with basic skills. I believe it's a larger social issue," he says. "There's much more stress and pressure on parents and children today, and that's reflected in what's happening in our educational system." <P> Stanizzo's assessment is backed by the Pitt report, which cites low reading and math skill levels among Pittsburgh's public school students as a "major disadvantage" for local economic development.Jesse Fiefe, vice president of operations at the Bidwell Training Center, echoes Stanizzo's concerns. "We're picking up school system problems," says Fiefe. "We have high school graduates who are reading at a fourth grade level -- they can't begin to compete." <P> The Bidwell Training Center has its origins in a grass-roots community effort in 1968. The goal was to equip low-income and minority group members with skills that would gain them entry into the work force. Center directors launched an ambitious fund-raising campaign in 1984; the state agreed to match the $3.5 million raised, and a state-of-the-art, 62,000-square-foot training center opened in 1986. <P> Fiefe, who holds a degree in political science and history from the University of Pittsburgh, has been with the center for more than 20 years. Operating funds for the nonprofit center come from various state and federal agencies and from contracts with corporations. The Bidwell Training Center has developed into a model of what can be accomplished when industry, government and community sectors work together. <P> Healthcare, a booming industry that's now leveling off in the region, has supported several Bidwell programs, Fiefe says. "For example, Thrift Drug came to us and asked if we could train pharmacy technicians," says Fiefe. Thrift provided financial, educational and technical support for a pharmacy technician training program and made a commitment to hire Bidwell graduates. Blue Cross of Western Pennsylvania made a similar commitment to a medical claims processor training program; both programs are boasting a 70% placement rate. <P> Bidwell also offers training for medical transcriptionists, medical secretaries, chemical laboratory technicians, information sciences and culinary technicians. "We identify needs and build programs to meet those needs; we're very flexible," says Fiefe. Graduates from Bidwell Center training programs typically land jobs with starting wages of $6 to $10 per hour and full benefits. "Our programs offer careers, not Band-Aids," Fiefe says. "And I think the corporate community is making an effort; we  just have to help applicants develop the skills." <P> But giving people the skills needed for today's job market is becoming an increasingly difficult task. Remediation, says Fiefe, is becoming the rule, not the exception, and nonprofit organizations like Bidwell must compete with other educational facilities for funds. "Colleges are tied into the state budget. We don't get that kind of money," Fiefe says. "But the government expects to take people from welfare rolls to employment -- it can't be done unless government recognizes the kind of contributions nonprofit educators like Bidwell make to the economy and community."

<font size =+2><B>It's the Attitude, Stupid: </B></font size> 
In December, Pittsburgh Mayor Tom Murphy announced he would steer a larger share of city contracts to women and minorities by expanding the office that monitors compliance with the city's affirmative action policy. The compliance office will also be charged with monitoring professional service contracts and contracts awarded by quasi-independent city authorities. The goal, says Murphy, is to see that at least 25% of city contracts are awarded to minority-owned firms. <P> The mayor's move echoes strategies recently announced by major firms. Bell Atlantic Co., for example, recently hosted a trade fair for minority- and women-owned businesses interested in winning supply contracts from Bell. Flagstar Cos. Inc., corporate parent of Denny's -- stung by a flurry of racial discrimination charges, worked with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to develop a plan that would put ownership of Denny's franchises into the hands of minority owners. <P> But large-scale corporate strategies are less important than the attitudes of those who make hiring decisions. "Affirmative action is a joke," says Williams. "Corporations will tell you that 12% of their workers are members of minority groups -- but where are they? At entry-level, low-paying jobs, for the most part. And they're systematically blocked from advancing." <P> Portis says that all sectors in the region -- private, public and political -- must make a commitment to equal opportunity from the top down, and corporations must respond to the inequalities in opportunity. "I hire African Americans," she says, bluntly. Those in the position to affect hiring practices must address the imbalance, she insists. "If that means hiring only African Americans until the work force is balanced, then that's what needs to be done -- and you can quote me."

<b><FONT SIZE=+2> Vocational Rehabilitation Center Mulach and Compton Awards 1995</FONT></B><br><FONT SIZE=+1><b></FONT SIZE></b><br>
<i>Compiled By Teresa K. Flatley</i>
<hr>

Each year, the Vocational Rehabilitation Center in Pittsburgh presents awards to two people who have provided leadership to others in the business community on behalf of people with disabilities.These awards are the Joseph F. Mulach Jr. Award, to recognize an individual who has helped make life more meaningful for people with disabilities, and the James F. Compton Humanitarian Award, which recognizes the efforts of a chairman, president or CEO (or those of his company) in improving the quality of life for people with disabilities through enhanced employment opportunities.The Mulach award was established to honor the former VRC board chairman, philanthropist and indus-trialist for his determination and commitment to the VRC. <P> Mulach, who is 88, joined the VRC board in 1962 and served three terms as chairman. He continues to serve on the board in an advisory capacity.Mulach's special leadership as chairman came at a very critical time and led to the construction of the present VRC facility on Forbes Avenue, which dramatically changed the course of the association's growth. <P> Past Mulach award recipients include John T. Hoover, Abraham J. Twerski, Vincent A. Sarni, Linda A. Dickerson, Douglas Danforth, Leonard C. Staisey, Ginny Thornburgh and Robert Dale Lynch.The Compton award was estab-lished in 1992 following the VRC board chairman's death. The award acknowl-edges James F. Compton's own desire to honor top executives in the business community for their leadership role in providing opportunities to people with disabilities. <P> Compton, himself a businessman, served nearly 10 years on the VRC board of directors, including two years as vice chairman and two years as chairman. During his tenure as chairman, the VRC was undergoing tremendous change and transition. He gave generously of his time and resources, and played a crucial and visionary role as he guided the VRC to financial stability and positioned the agency for the future. <P> Past Compton Award recipients are Wesley W. von Schack, Eugene J. Barone and Robert Mehrabian.

<font size =+2><B>People: The Greatest Resource </B></font size> <BR>
By John E. McGrady Jr.<BR>
Because no two people are alike, the Vocational Rehabilitation Center has always adapted its services to meet the needs of each and every consumer who comes through its door. <P> The VRC does this because it shares the long-range vision that western Pennsylvania business leaders have long understood: This area's greatest asset is its people, and the wise person will use that asset to the best advantage.Every day companies in this area recommit themselves to helping those with disabilities which ultimately helps all of us who live in this community.The ongoing support the VRC receives from the business community makes many things possible, but maybe the best thing it provides is independence to those who might not otherwise enjoy what many of us take for granted. The VRC allows people to make their own choices and then supports those choices so that they become a reality. <P> All of us in the community should constantly be searching for more ways to help people with disabilities because in the end, we all benefit from this area's greatest resource -- its people. <P> John E. McGrady Jr. is the retired senior vice president of provider affairs of Blue Cross of Western Pennsylvania. A member of the VRC board since 1988, McGrady also serves on the boards of numerous other organizations serving people with special needs. He is currently chairman of the Vocational Rehabilitation Center's board.

<font size =+2><B>A Job Well Done </B></font size> <BR>
By Robert J. Mather<BR>
For the past 67 years, the Voca-tional Rehabil-itation Center has been helping its consumers experience the sense of accomplishment that comes from a job well done as it prepares people for their futures through retraining and job placement.Last year we helped 1,200 people with disabilities experience this same sense of accomplishment others often take for granted. <P> More consumers were served at the VRC last year than ever before while at the same time placements for competitive employment also increased. <P>Consumers earned more and worked more hours than the year before. This was accomplished even though the total number of non-paid training hours decreased. <P> All of these facts reflect back to the people who help the VRC perform its job, including two men we are honoring this year: Edward V. Randall Jr., this year's Compton Award winner, and Fred Rogers, the Mulach Award winner. <P> We are pleased to acknowledge the tremendous work these two men have done for people with disabilities. They have been tireless advocates for those with disabilities and their efforts have broadened the horizons for others. <P> We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the business community for helping us find placements for our consumers, and to the greater community which has always given us its generous support. <P> Our newly adopted mission statement states that the VRC will continue its unique and innovative community leadership role of assisting persons with disabilities or other special needs to achieve dignity through independent living and productive employment opportunities. <P> Those with disabilities who are not employed make up the largest group in the unemployed population. In the Pittsburgh area alone, there are an estimated 34,000 people with disabilities. More than half of these people are unemployed. <P> Statistics such as these show us that we have a long way to go to prepare all of the people who need our help for their future by retraining them and placing them in productive, fulfilling jobs. <P> But the efforts of people like Ned Randall and Fred Rogers make our job a little easier. For that, we thank them. <P> The VRC was the first rehabilitation facility in Pennsylvania and one of the first in the nation to be accredited by the Commission of Accreditation of Reha-bilitation Facilities, which  accredited the VRC in seven vocational areas.We work closely with each of our consumers, becoming familiar with his or her skills, attitudes and habits so that after retraining, our consumers have been matched with placements offering the highest possibility of success, both for the consumer and our business clients. <P> The only way we at VRC can know if our services are genuinely meeting the needs of our consumers is to ask. So we did that, and our consumers told us that last year VRC met or exceeded their needs, a true vote of confidence. <P>We only have to look at our financial statement from last year to know that the VRC is a well-managed organization, showing an excess of public support and revenue over expenses, an efficiency level we have achieved time and time again. <P> That tells us that we are successfully adapting to ongoing changes in revenue support and to the needs of our consumers, and our goal of striving to continuously improve is being realized. <P> In fact, every VRC department, including vocational evaluation, work adjustment, work activities, skills practice, supported employment and job placement services, exceeded its service goals last year. <P> Last year, the VRC received a 5.4% increase in allocations and contributor choice pledges from the United Way after earning high scores from the organization's volunteer service review. <P> We also want to thank the community for making our "Challenges and Triumphs" capital campaign a success, the results of which were much needed renovations to the center to help us better serve our consumers. As the capital campaign draws to an end, we will continue to implement other necessary improvements to the center in 1995. <P> Robert J. Mather is president and CEO of the Vocational Rehabilitation Center.

<font size =+2><B>1995 James F. Compton Humanitarian Award Winner </B></font size> <BR>
Edward V. Randall Jr., this year's James F. Compton Humanitar-ian Award winner, doesn't know the exact date when he began his commit-ment to help people with disabilities but "it's been a lot of my life," he says. <P> Randall, the presi-dent and CEO of PNC Bank in Pittsburgh, is also chairman of the PNC Bank Foundation, which is responsible for donating millions of dollars throughout PNC Bank Corp.'s markets. <P>Each year, the Compton award is given to a president, chairman of the board or CEO for his or her efforts or those of the company, to improve the quality of life for people with disabilities through enhanced employment opportunities.Randall has spent his career searching for ways to help others help themselves because he believes that will eventually result in a better world for all of us.After starting with Pittsburgh National Bank in 1964 as director of personnel, it didn't take long for Randall to become aware of what the Vocational Rehabilitation Center was doing for people with disabilities.  He began to look at what could be done at the bank to help those with disabilities find productive employment.Working with the VRC, Randall was able to place several individuals in positions at the bank, which eventually led to these employees learning and performing other jobs which were then opened up to them. PNC Bank continues the association with VRC to this day. <P>His interest in tapping into the diversity of people has led to advantages for the bank and the community through affirmative action, community develop-ment, affordable housing and by provid-ing employment opportunities for people with disabilities. <P>In 1994, PNC Bank was named VRC Employer of the Year after the bank requested and used 80 people to help set up files at its western loan center. At the conclusion of the project, five individuals were asked to stay on at the loan center, and some are still employed there.PNC Bank also arranged a tour of its operational facilities for VRC repre-sentatives at the end of last year to determine if there might be additional employment opportunities for people with disabilities. <P>Further, PNC Bank has used VRC-associated workshops to assist in a variety of projects over the years. <P>Randall strongly believes those who hold company positions with the power to make things happen should do just that. In this way, he feels, they are telling their employees that someone else cares about what is happening in the community and is willing to help. <P> Company officers need to emphasize the "human side of the enterprise," Randall says, not stopping with providing an employment opportunity but striving to ensure that the work place is user friendly for those with disabilities."Once you've sat and talked with someone with a disability who only asks for a helping hand to become an independent member of society, you have to accept the challenge to go out and do something," Randall says.

<font size =+2><B>1995 Joseph F. Mulach Jr. Award Winner</B></font size> <BR>
Mister Rogers has been a television friend to millions of children for 28 seasons. But "grow-ing people of all ages," as he says, benefit from what he has to say as well.Fred Rogers, a Pitts-burgh area native and creator of "Mister Rogers' Neighborhood," is the Joseph F. Mulach Jr. Award recipient for 1995. <P> Each year the Mulach award winner is chosen by the Vocational Rehabilitation Center's board of directors to recognize an individual who has helped make life more meaningful for people with disabilities. <P> Speaking slowly and directly, Mister Rogers talks with his young friends during their television visits, his caring voice having special meaning for children who may feel they have no friends because they are different in some way from others. <P>Mister Rogers tells them again and again how special they are. He tells them he likes them just the way they are. And they believe him, proven with letters he receives from parents of children who have made remarkable strides over the years of watching the program. <P> What a gift he gives to children who may feel undeserving of friendship or love because of a disability; to children who are afraid they will be rejected by other children. <P>Mister Rogers' message of individual worth comes across every day in his program, but he considers his message only a basic foundation on which to build. <P>It's why he named his company Family Communications. He hopes people will expand his message with family and friends, but also with the other people they come into contact with each day, including people who have disabilities. <P>"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood" has positively introduced many people with disabilities to this country's children. Each of these appearances is part of the library of television visits aired annually, showing children these guests are an essential part of his neighborhood just as they are of ours. <P>Guests to the TV show have included people with hearing and vision impairments, Down Syndrome, spina bifida, and those who use wheelchairs. Mister Rogers asks his guests questions many of us may are too uncomfortable to ask. So instead we may avoid talking about the person's disability and often, we may simply avoid contact with that person. <P>By talking openly and respectfully with his guests, Mister Rogers shows children their curiosity is not a bad thing. He opens up a world to them where everyone is different and those differ-ences should be embraced. He affirms each person's self-worth. <P> Mister Rogers' favorite quotation is from "The Little Prince." It reads: "What's essential is invisible to the eye." In other words, it's what's inside that matters most.As he visits daily with children across the country, he reaffirms that belief. It's a foundation to build on.

<font size =+2><B>Fred Lang: Consumer of The Year </B></font size> <BR>
In the three years of rehabilitation that Fred Lang underwent after a serious accident in 1987, he had a lot of time to think about his life. <P> He thought about why he had survived the accident which left his body broken and in agony. He thought about how his life was not worth living. He thought about dying. <P> Today, 30 surgeries later, Lang feels that he has been given a new start. He is ready to move on to the dream that he thought would never be realized: owning and operating a landscape business. <P> Lang knows what made the difference in his life during those years of recovery. It was his daughter, Jennifer, now 13. "If it hadn't been for Jennifer, I would have given up. She's been an angel to me." <P>Lang, 44, is this year's recipient of the Leonard Weitzman Consumer of the Year Award. The award was established in 1989 in honor of the VRC's former president who retired after 41 years. <P> The award recognizes the outstanding performance and excellence in the workplace of a person placed by VRC. <P>It would be difficult to imagine Fred Lang ever really giving up. After his rehabilitation was finished, he attended a technical school to become retrained from his previous occupation as an electrician. <P> Lang was working as an electrician when the accident occurred. He was standing on a ladder at the former Volkswagen plant building in New Stanton when the ladder rung collapsed beneath him, sending him crashing to the ground. He suffered a fractured skull, broken ribs, broken legs and damage to six discs in his back. <P>The surgeries have helped, he says, and the pain he feels throughout the day is not so intense as it had once been. But he is not completely recovered. Further surgery for his feet and ankle are being scheduled. <P>After completing his technical school training, Lang faced a new obstacle. While interviewing for new jobs, he was always asked if he had any medical restrictions. <P> Lang gave the interviewers an honest answer. He couldn't remain standing or sitting in one position too long without moving or else his back would lock up on him. Thinking about how far Lang had come from the accident, this may have seemed relatively minor. But it was enough to keep employers from calling back. <P> When he began working with the Vocational Rehabilitation Center in 1992, Lang says he couldn't believe how much help he received from the staff. "They were fantastic. They did more for me than anyone else would do," he says, adding that staff always responded to his phone calls with a simple "come in and let's talk about it." <P>Within three months, Lang landed his present job working with computerized pipeline maps at Peoples Natural Gas where his supervisors generously allow him freedom to move around when he needs to. <P>He is planning to place his North Hills home on the market soon and begin following his dream of a landscape business this spring. He owns about 30 acres of land in Lawrence County off Interstate 79 and has already ordered 5,000 trees to plant as the first step to his new business. <P>He says he's a quiet man who likes to stay to himself and will enjoy the open space at his new home. <P>"I'm getting better," Lang says. "The pain, even though it ripples down my leg continuously, is not as severe as it was originally." It's something he's gotten used to, and to his way of thinking, it's not enough to stop him from pursuing his dream.

By Eugene J. Barone<BR>
I am pleased and honored to have been chosen to serve as honorary dinner chair at an event acknowledging the selfless accomplishments of Edward V. Randall Jr. and Fred Rogers, the 1995 Compton and Mulach Award winners, respectively.Ned Randall and I have known each other for nearly 20 years, having worked together on many community projects. I have always found him to be a bright man who engages himself fully in whatever he does. I believe his support of people with disabilities has been great evidence of that. <P> Mr. Rogers' name is synonymous with affirming self-esteem in children and accepting the differences in people. I have always found Fred to be exactly the same off-camera as he is on; a warm, caring man who quietly, but firmly, gets his message across. <P>We at VRC are grateful to these two men for their vision in supporting and encouraging people with disabilities and all people. <P>Blue Cross of Western Pennsylvania, where I worked for 36 years, was one of the very first companies to employ VRC consumers, and for that I have always been very proud. <P> As more and more consumers are placed by VRC at companies which open their doors to people with disabilities, we all reap the benefits of having helped others become the best they can be. <P> Eugene J. Barone is honorary dinner chair for the VRC awards. He is the past president, chairman and CEO of Blue Cross of Western Pennsylvania.

<B><FONT SIZE=+2><B>Shaking Up the DER</B></FONT></B><br>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Gov. Ridge wants to overhaul the state Department of Environmental Resources. Businesses stand to benefit.</B></FONT SIZE><br><i>By Raelin Sawka</i>
<hr>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B> </B></FONT SIZE><br>
Environmental regulations and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Resources have often been criticized as deterrents to economic development. While busi-nesses regularly cite the DER as an impediment, complaints are often louder and harsher during election years. Last year's gubernatorial race was no exception.Each candidate, from Democrat Mark Singel to the Independent Peg Luksik, had something to say about improving the DER, but no one's rhetoric was as strong as now-Gov. Tom Ridge's. <P> During his hustings, Ridge called the DER a "job-crushing, community-harassing, regulatory nightmare," and vowed to "end the intimidation, end the grandstanding and end the know-it-all attitude that plagues the department." <P> As a result of his promise to restructure the DER, Ridge was dubbed a "danger to the environment" by the Sierra Club, an organization that broke a long-standing tradition by making its first gubernatorial endorsement -- for Singel. <P> While environmentalists may be concerned about Ridge's intentions, business and industry leaders are hopeful that he will bring an end to the regulatory red tape, inconsistent enforcement and adversarial attitude of the state's environmental regulatory arm.<P> "Dealing with the DER has been very complicated, very bureaucratic and very costly to businesses and taxpayers," says Stephen Lee of Lee & Co., a communications consulting firm for environmental issues management. <P>Lee adds that the DER and the Environmental Protection Agency fail to consider "the burden [regulation] places on industry. These people think companies can afford to spend the money, but today companies are streamlined. They have limited resources." <P>Politically spawned, formed from a hodgepodge of smaller state agencies in 1970 and allowed to grow without any real plan, today's DER is a classic bureaucracy. Despite several reorganization and downsizing attempts, the department, which has a budget of over $500 million and more than 4,100 employees, is considered by many to be indecisive and mismanaged. <P>"The DER's delays in making decisions are common complaints among industry and citizens," says Bob Thompson, environmental senior partner at Pittsburgh law firm Meyer, Darragh, Buckler, Bebenek & Eck.  <P>Ridge proposes splitting the DER. The Department of Environmental Protection would continue with regulatory functions for air, water or land pollution; surface and deep mining; drinking water; radiation, and solid and hazardous waste. The Department of Conservation and Natural Resources would oversee the state parks and forests.Ridge also proposes delegating several ancillary programs to departments better suited for them. <P>New LeadershipA third way that Ridge plans to whittle the bureaucracy is to bring in new leadership. New management could engender a real change in employee motivation. <P> Ridge announced his executive appointees to the DER prior to his   Jan. 17 inauguration: James M. Seif to head the department as secretary, David E. Hess to serve as executive deputy secretary and Terry R. Bossert as chief counsel.Ridge's appointees, who all appear to have firsthand knowledge of environmental issues, have to be confirmed by the state Legislature. <P>Seif, a Philadelphia lawyer, served as legal counsel for the EPA's regional office in Philadelphia from 1973 to 1975 and as regional administrator from 1985 to 1989. Following his nomination, Seif stated that the DER is too "insular, bureaucratic, over-layered, slow and insulated from other parts of Pennsylvania life, such as economic growth."Seif is straightforward about problems and solutions for the department. He says the DER is "run by too many lawyers," causing it to be adversarial. <P>Before his nomination, Hess was the executive director of the Environmental Resources & Energy committee of the state Senate. <P> Nominee Bossert supervises the environmental practice for Harrisburg law firm McNees, Wallace & Nurick. He also has prosecuted environmental crimes with the state Department of Justice.  <P>"With this new appointment of Bossert, it appears that the governor meant what he said [that he will overhaul DER]," says Harley Trice, partner in the environmental section at Reed, Smith, Shaw & McClay. "Bossert will bring a balanced viewpoint to the DER." <P>While splitting up the department and appointing new leadership are steps toward the metamorphosis that Ridge envisions, environmental professionals believe there are other areas to address, such as regulation development. <P>"There is a lot of misconception by the public about the environment and what is good and what is bad. Our regulations are based on [public opinion] and not science," says Lee. "Regulation development has to be science based." <P>Others agree. Thompson says, "Regulations are currently based on politics, pop-science and the media. Too many decisions and regulations have been run by publicity and politics, not good science." <P> Seif says Ridge's proposed 21st Century Environmental Commission will help in this area. He adds that the commission will be balanced and eclectic, stating that it could include scientists, business people, politi-cians, educators and even experts from out of state if need be.Although Seif and Ridge advocate appointing such professionals to the new commission, critics say that with such a diverse mix, it will no doubt be difficult to reach consensus. <P>Environmental professionals and business leaders do agree, however, that with the DER working under principles of science, both the department and companies will be able to accomplish more, in less time, for less money.<P>An Expensive ExampleA client of Trice's wanted to redevelop a contaminated site adjacent to the company's existing building. Using risk analysis, the EPA approved the company's plan to encapsulate contaminants. Encapsu-lation cleans up the land to a safe -- rather than pristine -- level. The DER, however, "took a hard-line position," insisting that the site be completely decontaminated, says Trice."It was very frustrating. The company's proposal would have cost $120,000. The EPA indicated that was acceptable, but the DER insisted on excavation. DER-outlined excavation carried a $2 million price tag." <P>As a consequence, the company couldn't redevelop the land -- leaving it unused and contaminated for five years until the EPA finally did the work. Trice says that this case clearly points out the DER's inflexibility and is typical of the breakdown in communications that occurs between the state and federal agencies. <P>"The DER's inability to get along with the EPA has caused problems for industry many times," says Trice. <P>When talking with business and industry leaders, environmental professionals, environmentalists and even private citizens, it seems the DER's belligerence hampers not only commercial growth but environmental growth as well. <P>"Everybody feels that we need to take a step forward. ... With DER focused on a risk-based approach, we'll be able to do more for the environment and for business," says Trice. <P>Ridge and Seif agree. That's why the state Legislature will see an  industrial site recycling bill during its first session. This bill will set "standards for remediation so that you won't be on the hook forever," says Seif. <P>The bill is promising for business, including Pittsburgh's strong envi-ronmental industry. "I believe that it would be very positive for the economy," says Bruce H. Laswell, senior vice president of ICF Kaiser Engineers. "Environmental con-sulting, business and even local gov-ernments benefit from an active, growing economy and active, growing projects. Development of these sites means a lot to Pittsburgh as a city." <P>Attitude AdjustmentThe posture of an organization, especially one accustomed to being besieged, is difficult to change. For years, DER employees have been in the unenviable position of trying to protect the environment without costing jobs. Employees are roundly criticized, told by businesses that they are slow, combative and pro-environmentalists. Environmentalists accuse them of pandering to industry. The press stands by ready to air any dirty laundry. <P>Seif says the result is procrasti-nation, inconsistencies and irrespon-sibility. He also believes that he can bring about an attitude adjustment without losing valuable employees. <P>"There are a lot of good people at DER. They must be supported and defended in their mission. In the past, many employees have been personally attacked by environ-mentalists and the media. We can't let that happen," says Seif. "There are also some people that need to move around or be fired. That's very motivating to those left behind." <P>Seif's hard-line stance may be difficult for some workers; the DER has historically resisted reform. <P>When asked how he would handle those disinclined to such adjust-ments, Seif replies, "I can't help it if people don't like change. Part of why Tom Ridge was elected is because he promised changes." <P>Seif proposes a variety of refinements, including achieving goals over following procedures, help-ing people not "zapping them" and remembering that compliance is more important than enforcement. Some efforts will be guided by Ridge's pro-posed office of Pollution Prevention and Compliance Assistance. <P>The office of Pollution Prevention and Compliance Assistance will assist citizens, companies and governments with laws and regulations. <P>Ed Burkey, president of the Pittsburgh Center for Hazardous Materials Research, says that the office of Pollution Prevention and Compliance Assistance is needed. <P>"I've seen firsthand the value of not using the enforcement stick but rather a technical assistance carrot. Companies respond much better to a helping hand," says Burkey. <P>Seif says that the Ridge admin-istration has set a July target date for the department breakup and plans to pass environmental reform early in the legislative season. <P>For now, industry is skeptical, yet eager to see what takes place. If Ridge and Seif can follow through, it will mean less expensive compliance, better options for industrial site use, more realistic regulations and less per-case investment for environmen-tal consultants and lawyers.

<B><FONT SIZE=+2><B>Is It Worth Going Online?</B></FONT></B><br>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Going online has advantages for certain businesses depending on their needs.</B></FONT SIZE><br><i>By By David J. Molter</i>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B> </B></FONT SIZE><br>
T-shirt hangs on the wall of Ed Chang's North Side office. On the front of the shirt, juxtaposed with the imprint of a tire tread, are these words: "I got run over on the information superhighway." <P> Chang chuckles about the shirt, but acknowledges that its message is not far off the mark. "It's very easy to feel intimidated by the amount of material that's available about going online," Chang says. "We're trying to help people sort it out." <P> Chang's Common Sense Interactive Group Inc., a company he started over two years ago, is one of a growing number that specialize in giving the equivalent of driving lessons to local businessmen who want to travel in cyberspace, but don't want to become "digital roadkill." However different these businessmen may be -- and they range from first-time business owners to the heads of corporations -- they share a common question: "What will going online do for me?" <P> The answer isn't always simple.Working With a NetMost Americans probably became familiar with the term "information superhighway" not long after the 1992 election, when Bill Clinton and Al Gore began touting it as vital to the country's ability to compete in a global market. But an information super-highway of sorts has existed since 1969. It's called the Internet, and it's a worldwide linking of computers that began when the Pentagon asked its computer experts to develop a way for military and academic researchers to communicate electronically. Initially, only four research labs were linked in what was then called ARPAnet; by the late 1980s, however, millions of com-puters had joined. Today some 25 mil-lion users tap into Internet. Once a sport enjoyed mostly by academicians, "surfing the Net" has become a leading pastime for almost anyone able to afford a basic computer and a modem. The profiles of these recent converts fit no norm; one Pittsburgh entrepreneur confided that his 6-year-old granddaughter has an e-mail pen pal in Australia. But perhaps the largest group of first-time users last year was made up of businessmen. <P> Because in 1994, particularly in the last two quarters, companies large and small began to explore the impact of working with a Net. And to do that, they had to go online.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Tapping In: </B></FONT SIZE><br>
"Going online can have a lot of advantages for certain businesses depending on their needs," says Chang, whose company provides consulting services along with design of interactive programs that a company can use for sales presenta-tions or to market itself via electronic storefronts. <P>"It can provide ways of advertising and selling products and, through e-mail, a very easy way of commu-nicating with clients if they're out of town. It's a lot less expensive than picking up the phone and having a one-hour conversation." 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>What's the best way to get online? </B></FONT SIZE><br>
 There isn't one, experts say. <P>Several programs providing access to online services are available at almost any store that sells computers or software, and most have retail prices under $40. Most current desktop computer systems, whether IBM and compatibles or Apple, have the required 4K of random access memory, hard drive space (at least 150 megabytes) and internal or external modems (14,400 baud is the current benchmark) fast enough to handle loading of files from databases.CompuServe, Prodigy and America Online (AOL) are the big three commercial communications services. How big? CompuServe has 2.2 million subscribers; Prodigy, 1.2 million; AOL, just over 1 million, a figure that doubled in the last six months of 1994. Genie, eWorld, Delphi, Internet Online Services and Interchange Online Network have far fewer subscribers, but probably will gain members rapidly, especially since the Apple-developed eWorld is being bundled with Macintosh computers and a Windows-based version for IBMs is due this year. Each service offers a variety of options. But all provide what users agree can be a valuable tool for any business: a way of sharing information among peers.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>B-boards and Forums:</B></FONT SIZE><br>
Don Peebly, director of marketing for Pittsburgh's KSBH Architects, uses AOL, both at work and at home. He has used CompuServe and Prodigy, but finds AOL more user-friendly. <P> "It's Windows based and very easy to use," says Peebly. "From a business perspective, it's been very valuable to me, and I expect it to be even more so in the future. It's probably going to become indispensable to anyone in marketing or advertising." <P> Peebly uses AOL for research into distance education. "We do a lot of work at colleges and a fair amount at broadcast facilities, and we've detected a trend that combines interactive media with higher education and distance education," Peebly explains.  "We've visited several sites, but through America Online, I've been able to track any new information that's been published on the subject." <P>Peebly also uses AOL to research for articles, and he has used its online forums to see what's current in direct-mail marketing, which KSBH plans to explore this year.  <P>An informal survey of Pittsburgh area firms reveals that most use at least one online service to keep up with the latest developments. <P>"Online sharing of information is becoming more and more prevalent in accounting," says Bob Padgett, firm administrator of S.R. Snodgrass, an accounting firm with offices in Green Tree, Wexford and Beaver. Snodgrass' main location shares files with branch offices in Ohio and West Virginia. <P>Padgett and several Snodgrass employees also are online nationally through CompuServe. Snodgrass is online with a national association of CPAs, which has a committee contin-ually studying the latest technological advances. "And we are beginning to share simple spreadsheet information with almost 40 accounting firms from Maine to California," Padgett adds. "There's no need to reinvent the wheel because we have access to things other firms have on file." <P>That is just one way to use online services. Because the Internet allows virtually any business access to 25 million potential customers, it was inevitable that it eventually would be tapped for commercial purposes. Internauts, as longtime users call themselves, may not be happy about it, but the electronic mall is upon us. <P>Just down the hall from Chang's office in the converted brewery that hugs the base of Troy Hill, Abu Noaman is introducing Pittsburgh to the world, and vice versa. <P>Noaman's Internet Services Corp., a company he started in late 1993, provides services for organizations that wish to promote themselves over the Internet. ISC provides consultation, training and installation of connections and networking equipment. But the service Noaman feels has the most growth potential is the development of electronic domains or storefronts for commercial users of the Internet. <P> Electronic storefronts are a relatively recent phenomenon. In 1991, about 9,000 commercial ventures had storefronts in the Internet mall. By last year that figure had grown to 25,000. The rapid increase was due in large part to the growing ease of navigating the Net, which was made possible by user-friendly interfaces such as Mosaic. <P>Mosaic is a point-and-click interface that allows users to jump from one place on the Net to another through World Wide Web, a network of some 7,000 computers scattered around the globe that, although owned independently, operate together. <P> Noaman calls WWW "the Disneyland of the Internet," a significant enhancement for users who are less than technically adept. WWW made navigating the Net easy enough for potential consumers that companies such as Ford, IBM and JCPenney soon thought it viable to open Net storefronts. These commercial giants are being joined by smaller firms, including a number of western Pennsylvania companies.And on Jan. 19, the city of Pittsburgh went online through ISC. <P> The city of Pittsburgh's storefront is the online equivalent of promotional videos now being used by several cities, including Pittsburgh. ISC's design makes full use of available technology, which means video and audio clips abound. Through the storefront, anyone with access to the Internet can see and hear what Pittsburgh is all about. City assets are featured, including housing, universities, sports franchises, cultural resources, businesses and industry. All that's required to learn more about any of them is the click of a mouse button. <P> "It's not just a travelogue," Noaman points out. "It's a great marketing tool that Pittsburgh can use to attract companies that might be looking to relocate." <P>ISC's development of Pittsburgh's storefront illustrates how far the parameters of online marketing can be expanded. But simpler approaches are available. <P>For example, among ISC's clients is Gift Gallery Inc., a Murrysville-based gift basket company that, thanks to ISC, has tapped into the global marketplace. Internet users who find the Gift Gallery storefront attractive and click on the appropriate icon may browse through its online catalog. The catalog is complete, even down to graphic replication of the textured stock on which its paper cousin is printed. <P> Customers can examine pictures of the items and click on highlighted hypertext for descriptions. They also may fill out order forms that are sent to the ISC server, which in turn sends the order by fax to Gift Gallery. The company then contacts the customer to confirm and arrange payment. <P>Costs for putting a catalog online vary, but Noaman says a small company might expect to pay $150 per page for initial design, then a $100 per month Internet access fee. Although Noaman feels commercial use of the Internet will grow, he admits an electronic storefront is not for every business."Any company whose customers are not on the Net yet would not benefit, for obvious reasons," Noaman says. 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Three for the Road:</B></FONT SIZE><br>
Black Box Inc., a Canonsburg-based computer products company, has found that consumers are be-coming more comfortable with electronic shopping. <P> In the last six months, Black Box has launched three online pilot programs. The first was through IndustryNET, an online service started in 1993 by Don Jones, a Pittsburgh entrepreneur nationally considered a pioneer of online technology. <P>In July 1994, Black Box established a number of bulletin boards describing the company's products on IndustryNET, which is free to users. Through IndustryNET, Black Box gained access to more than 150,000 suppliers of computers, controls, instruments and manufac-turing systems in the United States. <P>"We're very pleased with the response," says Doug Goodall, vice president of business development at Black Box. But Black Box also decided to venture into cyberspace on a larger scale. In the last week of November, the company launched an online version of its catalog on the Internet. It was a big move for a company that had built its business using a direct-mail catalog with no field sales force, and an even bigger move considering that two years ago, Black Box had experimented with, but decided against using, a CD-ROM version. <P> "We found that although the CD-ROM catalog was well received, not enough businesses had PCs equipped with CD-ROM units," Goodall explains. "Our idea in going online was that with an Internet-based server here at the company, we would be able to have a lot of the dynamics of a CD-ROM -- pictures, text and, ultimately, video and audio -- but with a worldwide reach. It was very appealing -- if we could develop something that would cause people to come into our server."Working with Michael Bauer of The Internet Group, a Pittsburgh-based consulting company, Black Box developed software that allows ordering from its online catalog and installed a $50,000 in-house server. Obtaining Internet access through PREPnet Inc. and leasing high-speed phone lines will cost about $20,000 annually. About $200,000 was budgeted for the first year for development and refinement. <P> "Clearly, you can put something on the Net for a much lower cost at a much smaller scale, but we decided to be as robust as possible," Goodall says of the investment. <P>Users at 7,000 sites in 44 countries visited the Black Box storefront during its first six weeks of operation. A small number of orders have been placed, including one from Moscow, "which solidified in my mind that this does indeed have worldwide reach," says Goodall. Because there are so few benchmarks for successful performance of such ventures, however, Goodall isn't sure when the system will pay for itself.  <P>"We decided the real measure of its success would be if people used it and if they commented favorably on it," he says. "So far, they're doing both."As a third test of the power of online communications, Black Box ran a single-paragraph billboard on Prodigy, asking if users would like to receive a free catalog. Two thousand users asked to be added to the company's mailing list in the first four weeks. <P>"We're excited about all three pilots, even though we're not sure where they will go," Goodall says. "But we think it's a good leadership position for us to be taking." <P>Chang and Noaman agree with this approach. "The first step is to access," says Chang. "Pick a service and sample what's out there. Then contact a consulting service. They'll tell you what you're doing right and if you can benefit from linking up. Any good service will give you an honest assessment of where you stand. We're a multimedia company, but multimedia isn't right for everyone. We'll be honest enough to say, No, what you're doing is working fine. Stay with it.' ""Historically, electronics and computer companies have had the greatest success with electronic storefronts, but it can't hurt to test the waters," says Noaman. "If you're unsure, don't make a big investment: rent space on someone else's server on a trial basis, gather some information about the marketplace, then do it more strongly. <P>"Sooner or later, all businesses will be on the Net. The question is,  do you want to be a leader or a follower?"

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Paving the Way:</B></FONT SIZE><br>
Don Jones may not have built the information superhighway, but he has helped smooth the traveling for its users. <P>In 1990, Jones and some management professionals with expertise in electronic communications, marketing and publishing founded Automation News Network. It was Jones' goal to automate the buying and selling process. <P>His first step was to establish The Locator, an electronic yellow pages that currently lists 150,000 manufacturers and suppliers of products used by business and industry. ANN is now the largest supplier of electronic yellow pages in the United States, serving 22 states with 12 regional editions. The Locator is available on floppy diskettes and online via a number of information superhighway on-ramps. <P>One way is through IndustryNET, the online service Jones started in 1993 so businesses could tap into a comprehensive listing of products and services provided by other businesses. <P>IndustryNET was accessed by more than 350,000 users in 1994, and Jones expects log-ons to exceed 1 million in 1995. Like the Locator, IndustryNET is free to users. Some businesses pay a fee for more detailed descriptions of their products and services and amenities such as graphics. <P>Jones says IndustryNET is unique in that it can be accessed four ways: via computer using a standard modem; through the Internet's TelNET service; by using ANN's graphical user interface software, which can be downloaded for free; or, through World Wide Web, an international network of computers accessible through the Internet. <P> IndustryNET and The Locator proved so successful that in 1994, Jones decided to link the two. In early December, Jones rolled out the Western Pennsylvania Locator, the first of what he says will be 12 regional yellow pages editions similar to its predecessor. WPL lists information about some 9,500 companies in the region, including about 650 of Pittsburgh's largest businesses. And through the Internet's WWW, these businesses now have a foothold in the       global marketplace. <P> All are listed by name and by the products or services they provide. Cross-indexing allows users to search by product, then learn more about suppliers. ANN  software allows users to ask for more information, call sales representatives directly or place an order, all with a keystroke or the click of a mouse button. <P>"I'm a stickler for making these systems not just user friendly, but user intuitive," says Jones. <P>Over the last five years, ANN has expanded from a staff of three to 127 full-time and 30 part-time employees. Jones is aware of the burgeoning consumer online market, but for the time being he is content to serve business customers only. <P> "The business community is already here online," says Jones. "We'll go consumer when we serve our advertisers well."

Is This Area Becoming a Region?Aside from those who were not funded to the extent that they felt was appropriate, most people complimented the Allegheny Regional Asset District board on its ability to reach a consensus on how to allocate  <P> $53 million when the requests for the money more than doubled the available funds. A unanimous vote on who gets money, or who does not get money, when the stakes are $53 million high, was a celebrated accomplishment by almost any standard. <P>The competition for funding was intense. Allegheny Regional Asset District board members made some difficult choices. They reviewed over 1,000 pages of documentation, made dozens of site visits and listened to hours of public testimony. Seven individuals who hold demanding jobs and have other commitments zealously undertook their ARAD assignment and invested thousands of hours collectively in enhancing Allegheny County's quality of life. Precision teamwork facilitated an unprecedented and somewhat unanticipated unanimous final budget decision. <P> Not to discount the accolades bestowed upon the board, the most outstanding accomplishment was the passage of the legislation and not the passage of the budget. Yes, without a permanent staff or office, the district board beat the odds, packed a year's work into six months and reached consensus on extremely tough decisions. Yet, this accomplishment should in no way dominate the district's most preeminent end result. For the first time in recent history, the city, county and state joined forcesand worked together symbiotically to share resources and govern more efficiently. Each surrendered parts of their territory for the greater good. <P> This unprecedented cooperation is the most remarkable aspect of the Allegheny Regional Asset District, and the more ephemeral victory of a unanimous vote on the first budget should not overshadow the importance of the cooperative spirit which created the district. This landmark legislation will assume its rightful place in history as the first true foray into regionalism. <P> Let's hope that the ARAD's results spawn countless other regional approaches to government. This area must turn into a region to ensure its long-term vitality.Editor's note: Linda Dickerson served on the Allegheny Regional Asset District board.

<font size =+2><B>Upgrade and Correction:</B></font size><BR>
Your Chronicles in the January 1995 issue reported on the Weiss Rating opinions on Pennsylvania HMOs. HealthAmerica Pennsylvania Inc. has received an improved rating grade, subsequent to the original report. HealthAmerica Pennsylvania Inc. is currently rated C (fair). C indicates that this company offers fair financial security and is currently stable. This new rating is the result of additional information HealthAmerica Penn-sylvania provided to Weiss Safety Ratings.Thank you for publishing this information to correct the earlier report.Sue Ann Bailey, director of com-munications, Weiss Research Inc., Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.
<HR>
<font size =+2><B>Setting the Record Straight:</B></font size><BR>
We were dismayed when we read "Ranking Health Insurers" in January. Because the infor-mation on HealthAmerica is misleading and inaccurate, we want to set the record straight. <P>The article quotes Weiss Ratings Inc., an agency which, for a fee, offers consumers [ratings] on insurance companies' financial strength. Weiss only recently began to evaluate health insurance companies and HMOs, and based on our experience, their methods and analyses are irresponsible and inconsistent with industry norms. <P> Your article lists Weiss ratings for five insurers and HMOs that do business in western Pennsylvania. None of them scored very well. Given the enormous financial resources and stability of most of the firms listed, and the low ratings Weiss assigned to these same firms, one has to wonder what net worth Weiss requires for an A rating. <P> We contacted Weiss when we first heard about our rating. They had not contacted us before developing their rate -- a validation procedure you would expect any responsible rating agency to follow. Once we furnished them with pertinent data, they immediately upgraded our rating two tiers to a C. Apparently, they made no attempt to correct the press release they had issued earlier. <P> <I>Thomas J. Murray, vice president of marketing, HealthAmerica of Pittsburgh</I>
<HR>
<font size =+2><B>Defending HealthAmerica:</B></font size><BR>
The January 1995 Chronicles section had an article entitled "Ranking Health Insurers." As an independent brokerage writing a large amount of group health insurance, we were interested. <P> The source was Weiss Ratings Inc. The ratings would be humorous except the subject matter is so serious. <P> We are quite familiar with HealthAmerica, its mode of operation and its financial position. HealthAmerica is sound. <P> HealthAmerica's reserves far exceed the requirements of the Pennsylvania Insurance Commission. Their fiscal soundness is not an issue, yet Weiss awarded a low mark. This is unjustified. <P><I>A.V. Papa Jr., principal, Comprehensive Assurance, Monroeville</I>

<font size =+2><B>Environmental Economic Engine:</B></font size><BR>
I read the article on the brownfields and the greenfields [January 1995] with interest and warm support. Not only does the brownfields' reuse legislative thrust make sense for the commercial property market, but it actually makes sense for the somewhat beleaguered environmental industry. Greenfields virtually put a dead halt to risk analysis. What is more, they are invariably a depletion of natural resources. <P> So in an unusual unity of environmental activists with commercial interests, brownfield development is the best way to go. From an environmental testing laboratory standpoint, brownfields are also the best route. There should be more old industrial properties to evaluate if marketing reuse is handled properly. Moreover, the time needed to test and evaluate should be far less and also less likely to get bogged down. <P>Our environmental achievements give us an advantage over world competition.

Western Pennsylvania is known for the number and quality of its business, trade and technical schools, some of which are the largest of their type in the country. I am surprised that you did not see fit to include some information about these institutions [in your December 1994 Leadership Directory]. <P>I note that three of the 10 growth com-panies listed in the magazine [cover story] are electronics com-panies. The reason that they are successful is that schools like ours train the technical personnel which they need to perform their mission. <P><I>Philip Chosky, president, Electronic Institutes, Pittsburgh</I>

<font size =+2><B>Geography Lesson</B></font size><BR>
I read with no little interest the story in your December issue about target marketing by colleges and universities. Bethany College, less than an hour's drive from downtown Pittsburgh, retains the services of the city's George Hill Co. for target advertising. <P>Upon inquiry, I find that Executive Report wouldn't include Bethany because the college was not in western Pennsylvania. That's sad. Sociologists have known for a long time that political boundaries do not limit a community. Greater Pittsburgh certainly includes Bethany. Our major banking is in Pittsburgh, it is our transportation and entertainment center, we read Pittsburgh newspaper and watch Pittsburgh TV. <P>More importantly, western Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh in particular, has provided the largest contingent of students to this old college as long as anyone can remember. But that's no surprise, since 82% of the people living within 50 miles of Bethany are Pennsylvanians. <P>Pittsburgh business does not limit itself by state line; why doesn't Executive Report expand its view of Greater Pittsburgh? <P><I>Robert A. Sandercox, vice president of development, Bethany College, Bethany, W.Va., r.sandercox@po.Bethany.wvnet.edu</I>

<!IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="GuestEditor.gif"> <FONT SIZE=+2><B>The PA Crime Debate: Make It About Character and Community</B></FONT SIZE><br><i>By Don E. Eberly</i>
<HR>
In January, the Legislature began a special session on crime that was expected to last up to six weeks. It presented a rare opportunity for citizens to gain insights into one of society's most vexing problems. <P> The session was this state's response to a nationwide move-ment to get tough on criminals. In exchange for costly new provisions, citizens deserve to know what will likely work.  <P>The legislative agenda, set forth by the new governor, offers a long list of provisions aimed, in dozens of small ways, to tighten state criminal laws. <P>Most of the provisions, of course, have merit -- lots of merit. But what seems to be missing thus far in this debate, like so many, is an overarching understanding of where exactly crime is coming from and what society, not just politicians, must do to reverse it over the next decade. <P>The debate cannot simply be about more cops, better caseworkers or tougher criminal statutes. The evidence that tougher penalties, better policing or improving social spending, by themselves, will substantially reverse growing criminality is weak. These measures can help communities cope, but they are powerless by themselves to cure crime. <P> Crime is a function, according to America's foremost expert James Q. Wilson, of the presence or absence of character in society and the strength or weakness of institutions that foster it. <P> The explosive rise in juvenile crime illustrates the point. Those involved in the criminal justice system today report that youthful offenders are more ruthless and free from the shackles of personal conscience than ever. These are not individuals who are likely to stop and thoughtfully ponder the penalties or rewards of this or that course of action. For many juveniles, a trip to prison is a rite of passage, a source of pride. <P> Moreover, in many communities, residents are retreating into their fortified homes because street life has degenerated into incivility and disrespect. Many neighborhoods are under virtual assault, not always from violent crime but from petty harassment and offensive behavior. No crime bill will do much to affect this mean and disorderly behavior. <P>If crime is the price civilization pays for abandoning character, where does society turn? <P>Character and moral reasoning are internalized in children through healthy value-shaping institutions of society, starting with the family. The business of restoring these institutions will not be undertaken so long as the debate over crime is fixated entirely on policy reforms.It will require society-wide movements to strengthen community and parenting. Young people, particularly young males prone toward aggression, must be habituated -- a term used by Wilson to describe how positive habits of self-regulation and concern for others are developed. <P> Crime is and always has been overwhelmingly a male problem. Violent crime in particular, from rape to armed robbery, is perpetrated by aimless males who lack strong attachments to family and community. <P> The key factor is the presence or absence of a father. Social research indicates that when this factor is taken into account, the relationship of crime to both income and race disappears. Why? Because it is the father, not just a child support check, that socializes the male into responsible adulthood.There is no record in history of a society that has succeeded without paying attention to this unavoidable fact. For political debates to contribute to long-term change, they should engage the public in a new understanding of the role citizens and communities    must play. <P> A real conversation about crime might emphasize the following: 
<DL>
<LI>Citizen-led strategies for neighborhood crime prevention. A lot of crime occurs simply because communities have become too tolerant of general social disorder. 
<LI>Community projects to discourage teen pregnancies and involve fathers in the lives of children. Gov. Ridge's emphasis on organizing community-based strategies aimed at root causes deserves praise. 
<LI>Rigorous character education programs in schools and other community institutions which can reinforce pro-social behavior. 
</DL>
The crime debate presents an opportunity for a serious shift in the state from an old paradigm of governmentalism, which emphasizes what politicians can do about crime, to a new paradigm centering on civic-moral renewal and the role every individual person can play. Over the long haul, such a strategy could strengthen the security of our neighborhoods and revitalize civic life in the process. <P>

Advances in local cycli-cal issues along with a stronger market in general combined to send the ER Index up 6.6% for the month ended Jan. 13. That compares favor-ably with the 4.06% turned in by the S&P 500 during that same period.Since inception, the ER Index is now up 6.82% vs. just 0.84% for the S&P 500. We continue to believe that investing locally is the best choice. Though there are probably a few scattered up in the hills, we've not been able to locate any insurgent rebels in the area. Additionally, we don't believe either Bill Clinton or Tom Ridge favors devaluation of the nation's currency. And while there continue to be some rumblings following the Steelers' playoff loss, earthquakes and other natural disasters are still rare in these parts. There's something to be said about stability. 
<DL>
<LI>Johnstown America led the list of winners, up nearly 36%, as the company recovered from a dreadful couple of months that saw its stock price sink to a low of $10.50 per share in early December. The railcar maker announced it purchased Bostrom Seating Inc., of Piedmont, Ala., for $30 million. Bostrom, with approximately $55 million in sales last year, is the leading manufacturer of suspension and static seating for the heavy truck market. More importantly, it was the first acquisition for Johnstown since the company went public in 1993. Management has said all along that it intends to acquire other transportation-related manufacturing companies. 
<LI>Legent advanced nearly 24% for the month, to $36.25 per share. On Jan. 3, Legent announced it had hired Jerre Stead as its chairman and CEO. Stead, who had been chairman and CEO at AT&T's computer unit, has a reputation as a turnaround specialist. He is expected to speed Legent's transformation from its historic focus on mainframe-based software to smaller networks of personal computers and workstations. Stead is also expected to smooth the company's financial performance, which tends to be erratic and difficult to predict.
<LI>Respironics jumped almost 20% for the month, to $27.75 per share. Despite receiving a warning letter from the Food and Drug Administration, the manufacturer of respiratory therapy products is rumored to be the potential target of a number of possible suitors. Cowen & Co., an investment banking firm, said there were several large medical-supply companies that would have an interest in acquiring Respironics.
<LI>Both steel companies in the Index, Allegheny Ludlum and USX -- U.S. Steel, posted more than 11% gains, and Alcoa and PPG Industries also moved up significantly.
<LI>Mellon Bank Corp. reported a strong end to 1994, with fourth quarter earnings up 24% from the prior year. Those results did not include its $130 million charge the bank took to protect its Boston Co. clients from further losses due to rising interest rates. Mellon finished up more than 11% for the month, to $34.25 per share.
<LI>Heinz advanced more than 6% for the month, but actually traded higher, as rumors swirled that the company would be the next large food processor to be bought out. Speculation intensified following the acquisition of Pet Inc. by Grand Metropolitan's Pillsbury unit.
<LI>Crown American also posted a nice gain, of nearly 7% to $13.63 per share, despite a fire at its Logan Valley Mall in Altoona just before Christmas. The shopping center REIT an-nounced that it hired George M. Sakakeeny to head up its acquisition-related activities. Sakakeeny was previously with the much larger Equitable Real Estate Invest-ment Management, where he helped manage a $7 billion real estate portfolio consisting of 77 regional malls and 42 strip centers.
<LI>Cable Design Technologies, which announced record results for the quarter ended Oct. 31, said it would sell 2.5 million shares, including 1.7 million owned by current shareholders, in a secondary public offering.
<LI>In mid-December, Michael Baker took another step in its turnaround efforts, announcing a reorganization of its operating units to more specifically target core markets, a strategic redirection of its Mellon Stuart Construction subsidiary and the imple-mentation of stronger financial controls at its Baker/MO subsidiary. The company also said it would take fourth-quarter charge of ap-proximately $10 million, pre-tax, which had been expected. The objectives of the re-structuring: to improve project and operating performance and to make money.Doug Thomas is vice president and director of research at the HomeState Pennsylvania Growth Fund in Lancaster.

Ever wanted to learn Swahili in Nairobi? If you have the time and money, Frontiers International Travel of Wexford can help make Swahili your second language.Frontiers has been specializing in unusual trips to more than 40 countries for 25 years. "We have a great repeat [business] with our travelers," says Susan Fitzgerald, owner of the family-run agency. Robert C. Duff, vice president of the Pittsburgh office of Smith Barney Shearson Inc., spent his last two summer vacations salmon fishing in Russia on Frontiers' trips. Duff, active in fly fishing for years, wanted to experience the sport in another country. <P> "I got plenty of pointers on where to go," says Duff. "And when I decided to travel to Russia, they set up the entire trip, from the flight to all my reservations. It was one-stop shopping." <P> Among those who have taken a seven-day, six-night salmon fishing trip to the Ponoi River above the Arctic Circle in northwest Russia for nearly $7,500, are Hugh McColl, chairman of NationsBank Corp. in Charlotte, N.C., and Paul Volcker, former Federal Reserve chairman. <P> Frontiers organizes fishing, bird-shooting, safari, natural history and other sojourns for more than 5,000 travelers a year. Trips run anywhere from $1,200 to $10,000 a week. <P> In addition to 50 employees in Wexford, Frontiers has an office in London and recently bought out a competitor in Boston. About 15% of Frontiers' clientele live in western Pennsylvania; 75% come from across the country, and 10% are international globe-trotters. <P> Frontiers hopes to continue expansion. "We're doing something right because in the past 10 years we've doubled our size," says Fitzgerald. "I think we have a special niche in the travel world." Although most of Frontiers' clients are men, Fitzgerald has noticed more women growing interested in outdoor traveling. Trips to Brazil and Christmas Island in the Central Pacific have become popular with couples and families.

The Department of Commerce invested $3.3 million in Gorell Enterprises, an Indiana County window manufacturing plant. It's the state's largest economic development project in the county. <P> The window maker opened at the former Season-all plant, which closed in 1993, costing 200 jobs. <P> U.S. Rep. John P. Murtha helped secure $1.5 million in federal funds along with an economic development partnership loan from the Commerce Department. Other monies included a $500,000 equipment loan, a $200,000 Pennsylvania capital loan fund and a $509,000 business infrastructure development grant. <P> The state Department of Community Affairs invested $200,000 through its enterprise zone loan program.The company is headed by former Season-all co-owner Wayne Gorell, whose family founded the operation in 1954. <P> According to former Commerce Secretary Andrew Greenberg, who resigned last year, the $7.8 million project should create 500 jobs within five years. "Without [Gorell's] personal and financial commitment, these jobs would have been lost for good," says Greenberg.

There's no need to limit yourself when visiting Tuscany Premium Coffee. The company has as many varieties as days in a year. <P> Tuscany, in Fifth Avenue Place, Oakland, One and Two Mellon Bank Centers and Arabica Inc.'s former shops in Oakland, Squirrel Hill, Shadyside and the South Side, credits its success to the popular Seattle-style blend. <P> The use of arabica beans rather than robusto beans, says Edward Wethli, president of Tuscany Western Pennsylvania/West Virginia, is what makes the coffee special. "Once [people] try it, they don't want to go back."Pittsburgh's per capita consumption of coffee, an average of 3.1 cups per day, is the highest of any American city, according to the National Association for the Specialty Food Trade. <P> The industry is in for another growth spurt in Wethli's opinion, thanks in part to the popularity of cafes in bookstores. Borders in Norman Centre II in the South Hills has expanded with a coffee section and Barnes & Noble stores often have an area for java lovers. "There will be a lot of growth for coffee in the next two years," Wethli says. Seattle-based Tuscany hopes to establish 25 locations in metro Pittsburgh.

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Stars in PA Manufacturing: </B></FONT SIZE><br>
Plastics and drugs are the growth areas for Pennsylvania's manufacturing base. At least that's the conclusion of economists at Penn State University. "In 1992-93 alone, plastic products and drugs generated more than 9,000 jobs," says Theodore E. Fuller, a develop-ment economist in agricultural economics and rural sociology at the college of agricultural sciences in University Park. "These two industries ... are now among the commonwealth's top five manufac-turing employers. Plastic commodi-ties are likely to replace steel as the state's main manufacturing product in the next few years if current developments continue." <P> Recent trends suggest that Pennsylvania manufacturing is finished with the major downsizing that has characterized it since 1980. "This indicates that the state's manufacturing industries are more competitive and efficient than in the past," says Stephen M. Smith, associate professor of agricultural economics and rural sociology. "This in turn bodes well for future growth in the increasingly open global economy."

Average annual wages in Allegheny County increased nearly 50% from 1982 to 1992, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry. The county ranked sixth highest in wages out of all 67 counties. <P> Greene County ranked seventh highest in annual wages with an increase of 42% from 1982 to 1992 due to high wages in mining.

<FONT SIZE=+1><b>Our region has negative labor-management relations, a punitive tax structure and a lack of regionally coordinated marketing. Now what?</FONT SIZE></b><br>
<i>By Paul Kengor  </i>
<P>

Despite having the fifth highest population of any state in the country, Pennsylvania ranked 18th in new business facilities and expansions from 1991 to 1993. Meanwhile, next-door neighbor Ohio ranked first. The 1993 Top 20 Business Climates list in "Site Selection" did not include Pennsylvania. While it is difficult to know precisely how the southwestern Pennsylvania region performs in business attraction and retention, there is a consensus that there is room for improvement.
<P>
"There is a clear need that we can and should do better than we are," says Tim McNulty, director, Center for Economic Development, Carnegie Mellon University. "I think that the real focus for the region should be on retention and start-up." 
<P>
There has been disagreement over the regional economy's per-formance in recent years. A "White Paper" developed under Robert Mehrabian, CMU president, gives a gloomy assessment of manufacturing - it fell from 27.7% of the employment base in 1970 to 11.7% in 1990. Some 40 industrial plants permanently closed in Allegheny County from 1979 to 1985.
<P>
Reports by the University of Pittsburgh's Center for Social and Urban Research are more rosy. Ralph Bangs, co-author of the Pitt study, shows that from 1987 to 1992, Allegheny County had the second highest rate of growth in per-capita personal income among the nation's 50 largest counties, a key indicator of economic growth. The county also had higher than average job growth.
Both studies agree, however, on the region's liabilities. In fact, most analyses of the region come to the same conclusion: We have negative labor-management relations, a punitive tax structure and a lack of regionally coordinated marketing. Which hurts the most?
<P>
"I would vote for all three,"   says Thomas J. Murrin, dean of Duquesne University's School of Business and Administration. 
<P>
Murrin argues that the negative labor-management image is mostly a misperception. The area's high level of unionization gives it a global reputation as an old mill town where labor and management are constantly bickering.
<P>
Publicized strikes at the Port Authority, Giant Eagle, Moonlight Mushroom Co., The Pittsburgh Press, Allegheny Ludlum and a number of school districts have fueled the fire. In 1993, Fortune magazine ranked Pittsburgh's labor relations as America's worst.
<P>
According to a 1994 study by Tripp-Umbach & Associates Inc. for the Conference on Real Estate of Southwestern Pennsylvania, 47 states have lower levels of union elections than Pennsylvania.
<P>
For many, unions mean higher operating costs and strikes. The Tripp-Umbach study concludes: "A number of the companies we interviewed confirmed that union activity (both perceived and real) is still a serious deterrent to attracting new employers, especially manu-facturing companies, to the region. It is not just an issue for those trying to attract new companies, union-ization is also an issue effecting business retention and expansion."
<P>
The Three Rivers Labor and Management Committee says 98% of the region's labor disputes are resolved without a strike. Still the 2% that aren't settled promulgate the negative image.
<P>
<font size =+2><B>Make a Pledge</B></font size> <BR>
A report from the Regional Economic Revitalization Initiative, which was developed at CMU's Center for Economic Development as a result of the white paper, calls for the establishment of a Pittsburgh Pledge between labor and man-agement to "use all means possible to resolve disputes without a strike" and "help establish a new era of labor-management partnership" to clean up the image.
<P>
Murrin is hopeful that the pledge will help. The problem is "as much a management challenge as a labor challenge. It's not one-sided," says Barry Maciak, director of Duquesne University's Connelly Center for Entrepreneurship and Emerging Enterprise.
<P>
Our second liability, a punitive tax structure, is quite damaging, too. "Everyone seems to agree that [our tax structure is one of the] worst in the nation," says Murrin. "That's terrible. It's a major deterrent not only to attract new businesses but also to retain the current ones."
<P>
Pennsylvania has the country's highest corporate taxes. Until recently, the state had the second highest corporate net income tax rate at 12.5%. In the Tripp-Umbach study, the region's CNI tax rate was significantly higher than much of its competition. Also, Pennsylvania is one of only 15 states that has both a corporate income tax and a capital stock and franchise tax.
<P>
Taxes ranked as the No. 1 issue facing Pennsylvania companies in a survey of commonwealth business leaders published by Coopers & Lybrand L.L.P. in September 1994. Although the "Fourth Annual Pennsylvania Economic Survey" yielded the most optimistic responses in its history, "... it's clear that we still have some serious work to do in terms of improving the overall business climate of the state," says Warren Jones, managing partner of Coopers & Lybrand, Pittsburgh.
<P>
Despite the tax problem and the poor labor-management image, many see a panacea for the area's ills: greater regional cooperation to promote our strengths. "We need to work on ... building a better image for Pennsylvania and a perception of a solid economic base," says Jones.
<P>
The region has an outstanding quality of life, excellent work force, impressive philanthropic network, world-class educational facilities and blossoming technologies.
<P>
Pittsburgh's high quality of life earned it the nation's highest livability ranking 10 years ago by "Places Rated Almanac," rating well in education, healthcare, housing and safety. (The city is currently ranked fifth in livability.)
<P>
In recent years, the city has been recognized as the Safest U.S. City Over 1 Million Population by Century 21 Real Estate and the Sixth Best City for Raising Children by Savvy magazine, among other accolades.
<P>
"One of the biggest selling points Pittsburgh has to potential businesses is its traditional neigh-borhoods," says Cathy Curley, media communications specialist, Neigh-bor Fair Pittsburgh Inc. 
<P>
The city also has major league baseball, football and hockey teams, and outstanding fine arts. "Look at the downtown cultural district - the Pittsburgh Opera, the symphony, the ballet - then cross the bridge to the Warhol museum," says Curley, "Go to Oakland and the nationality rooms at Pitt, the Carnegie Library and museums. Those are all big attractions. That has to serve as an advantage to businesses."
<P>
The region also has strong technology capabilities in environmental engineering and reme-diation, information technology, healthcare, biomedicine, software, specialty metals and high per-formance manufacturing. Some say technology will play a large role in our future.
<P>
"I think it's the future of the city," says Lawrence McGeehan, president, Ben Franklin Technology Center of Western Pennsylvania. He adds that if the region is going to remain in the forefront, it needs to continue to manufacture. "The kind of manufacturing that we can compete in is in producing knowledge-driven manufacturing products," he says.
<P>
A group of industrialists from Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia recently formed a private foundation to develop a high performance manufacturing zone in the tristate region. In November, 45 industrialists had the first meeting for the project, which encompasses 10 counties in Pennsylvania, and 15 each in Ohio and West Virginia.
<P>
"[The project] allows the region to look at its strengths and needs and inform local governments what changes are needed to help improve high performance manufacturing," says Maciak, whose center is a temporary home for the foundation. 
<P>
According to Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., the organization will be an industrially focused effort "with the objective of making us globally competitive."
<P>
Maciak feels that nearby states should be seen as partners in a global economy and models of the best practices, not rivals. "The future of high performance manu-facturing in the region is tied real close to neighboring regions," he says, "because a lot of economic activity occurs between state lines. We need those lines to disappear. ... We need to look beyond  south-western Pennsylvania."
<P>
The region does need to aggressively enter the global economy to take advantage of an increasingly economically inter-dependent world. A Penn State study indicates that the overriding problems facing Pennsylvania manufacturers in the 1990s are competitive in scope. "These [problems] are simply symptoms of an underlying challenge to the state's abilities to become a more vibrant and competitive player in the national and world economy," says David L. Passmore, professor of vocational education at Penn State in University Park.
<P>
According to a 1994 study by the Southwestern Pennsylvania Regional Development Council, "there is very little interest in international trade between the region's small- and medium-sized manufacturers - exporters and nonexporters alike" despite countless studies documenting the benefits of foreign sales. Worse yet, the report notes, "perhaps most surprising is the point that the local manufacturers are aware of these benefits."
<P>
If they know the rewards, why don't they export?
<P>
"What we find is a psychology where a businessman will say, I don't want to try something hard that I don't know.' It is a fear of the unknown - an intimidation," says Rita L. Pollock, executive director, SPRDC. "Also, many simply don't know how to export. [They ask,] How am I going to get paid, in dollars or foreign currency? Who will buy my products?' They simply don't know because they've never done it before."
<P>
Pollock notes that many local firms have no problem establishing ties in, say, California, but outside of the country, even in Canada, is out of the question.
<P>
To overcome such fears, Pollock advocates creating "a culture of exporting" through publicity and education. She argues that export success by some will give others the confidence to do the same. 
<P>
Pollock's group wants to attract local companies to trade shows that might give them a valuable foothold in the global marketplace. Response is poor, however. Sometimes a mailing to 300 or 400 manufacturers will net as few as six responses.
<P>
Another organization poised to assist is the World Trade Center Pittsburgh, which, among other things, sponsors matchmaking sessions for local companies and international representatives to discuss partnerships. A recent example: a three-day event introduced environmental techno-logy companies based here to markets in Latin America. The group is joining with the Nicaragua/ Pittsburgh Cooperative Program and Duquesne's Small Business Devel-opment Center to sponsor a Nicaraguan trade and investment mission later this month.
<P>
World Trade Center Pittsburgh is also part of the Western Pennsylvania Export Consortium, which includes the Pittsburgh offices of the U.S. Department of Commerce and Small Business Administration, Duquesne's Small Business Devel-opment Center, the Ben Franklin Technology Center, the Western Pennsylvania District Export Council and SPRDC. The con-sortium brings together local, state and federal programs to provide market identification and assess-ment, market penetration, and on-line and direct-access services.
<P>
Additionally, the Pennsylvania Department of Commerce has instituted the Pennsylvania Export Partnership Trade Event Program to provide financial incentives for  manufacturers.
<P>
Despite such programs, a January 1994 report by Pitt's Center for Social and Urban Research concludes: "The region should do a better job promoting foreign exports, especially with the increased opportunities available through the recent NAFTA and GATT agreements. Foreign export assistance agencies tend to be small, understaffed and underfunded. Both duplication of services and gaps in services are perceived to exist. Further, the scattered and fragmented delivery of services creates barriers to firms receiving the full range of services needed. Export assistance agencies need to coordinate themselves and improve programs."
<P>
Most everyone agrees on the need for enhanced cooperation among economic development agencies.
<P>
"We need strategic planning for economic development more than once every 10 years," says Bangs, referring to the reports completed by the Allegheny Conference on Community Development in 1984 and 1994. "We need a strategic planning organization which has the expertise to do good economic analysis on an on-going basis, in-cluding analysis of the region's strengths and weaknesses, as      well as the ability to forecast        the likely economic impacts of  strategic plans."
<P>
<font size =+2><B>Look to Albany</B></font size> <BR>
Ron Gdovic is a local economic development consultant who has analyzed regional development planning organizations throughout the country. He recommends that the region look at the Center for Economic Growth in Albany, N.Y., as a prototype. Albany's center focuses on job creation through the attraction and expansion of business. It cooperates with the Albany Times Union and the Rockefeller Institute to promote regional cooperation and consol-idation of government functions.
<P>
"The Albany group, in my opinion, is the best model for this area," says Gdovic. "The key to that group is that it is an umbrella organization that coordinates efforts, and that's what south-western Pennsylvania is lacking. What also makes it effective is its relationship to the media. The key to the media link is that it helps promote not only the region but also the organization."
<P>
The recently completed RERI report, "The Greater Pittsburgh Region: Working Together to Compete Globally," goes a long way toward exploiting regional assets, laying out a strategy that incor-porates real-world suggestions into an action-oriented timetable.
<P>
The report is the product of a nine-month effort by local civic leaders to develop a vision for economic development for Greater Pittsburgh.
<P>
"There was a sense throughout the community to balance a need for greater coordination, while also trying to retain some of the strengths of decentralization," says McNulty. "We call for creating a unified marketing strategy. That is one of our top priorities."
<P>
Within the report is a plan to stimulate job growth in the region's advanced technology sector. The report calls for mentoring teams from a cross section of public, private and community leadership to support an R&D effort to make Pittsburgh the robotics capital of the world, establish the biomedical industry of tomorrow (through a tissue engineering initiative) and create the sustainable Pittsburgh environmental initiative.
<P>
The report calls for improving the links between Greater Pittsburgh and the world economy and creating an independent tax council charged with developing a reform for the state development business plan. According to McNulty, some actions were to take place within 100 days after the report's release on Nov. 17, 1994.
<P>
The RERI report, says Maciak, "challenges us to take those initiatives and make something happen." Murrin echoes those senti-ments: "[The report] is tremendous, with all of these worthwhile ideas. Now we come to the most impor-tant part-implementation." Indeed, the region's ability to act on the report will say a lot about its ability to serve its future economic interests at home and abroad.

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>There can be no doubt that stress exists in the workplace, and that it is damaging to both worker and company.</B></FONT SIZE><br><i>By Lydia Strohl</i>
<HR>
On an unseasonably warm and drizzly day early last December, seven employees of the Westinghouse Energy Center gathered around a conference table during their lunch hour, eating hamburgers, salads and vanilla frozen yogurt out of plastic cafeteria carry-out containers. Much of the talk centered around the devastating layoffs that had gone into effect at Westinghouse the previous week, cutting 20% of the 1,500 employed at the energy center alone, as the group shared job, family and community worries and optimisms.
<P>
The group, members of the Pittsburgh Experiment, an inter-denominational ministry that provides spiritual resources to the business community, also shares prayers. This meeting, and the dozens like it that take place throughout the area in any given week, are an uncommon solution to a common business problem: stress in the workplace.
<P>
"You see people getting on the berm, where it's easy to slide off and hit gravel, and you don't know who will survive," says one member. "There are a lot of people hurting and not enough people helping. They're saying, Thank goodness they're on the berm, not me.'"
<P>
"I think that's survival instinct," says another.
<P>
"Those left are absorbing even more work, and that drives you even closer to the berm," points out another. "I know one secretary who now has 20 [executives]. She's on the berm just thinking about it."
<P>
"I've also felt grief. Members of this group have been laid off," says a fourth member. "One volunteered himself - that was a gutsy move. I've survived 13 layoffs. Now I try to turn it over to God, and not sweat the details, but I wasn't always this way. I try to put it in perspective."
<P>
And so the discussion goes, each member taking a turn to voice concerns, affirm the worries of others and occasionally to offer advice. For 40 years, the small groups of the Pittsburgh Experiment have con-ducted what the secular world might term "group therapy." The group comes together via a collective faith in God, and support is lent by talking amongst themselves and praying for one another. It is not an official program of Westinghouse, but according to Jim Mottley, the group's leader, the company encourages the group and lends its support in the form of a meeting place.
<P>
"This location is good at promoting stress management," says Mottley, for 30 years a fellow engineer with Westinghouse. "They have an excellent workout facility; counseling is available and so are courses on stress management. This meeting is thought of as another outlet for stress."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>What's the Damage?</B></FONT SIZE><br>
There can be no doubt that stress exists in the workplace, and that it is damaging to both worker and company. Just look at the facts:
<P>
 Sixty-seven percent of all visits to family doctors are prompted by stress-related symptoms, including asthma, allergies, headaches, excessive fatigue, indigestion, loss of appetite, insomnia, nausea, anger, anxiety, irritability and depression. (Source: The American Academy of Family Physicians)
<P>
 Forty-six percent of a 1991 random sample of U.S. workers said their jobs were highly stressful, up from 20% in 1985. Thirty-nine percent said they felt so much stress they were thinking of quitting. Only 4% said they were nearly stress-free. Respondents having multiple stress-related illnesses increased from 13% in 1985 to 25% in 1991. Thirty-five percent reported that stress caused them to leave their last job. Seventeen percent reported that stress caused them to miss one or more days of work in 1990. (Source: Northwestern National Life Insurance Co.)
<P>
 More than 1 million days of absenteeism and more than $20 bil-lion in workers' compensation costs each year can be traced to stress. (Source: Paul Siegel, attorney, Jackson, Lewis, Schnitzler and Krupman)
<P>
 The average stress-related workers' compensation claim costs employers at least $13,339. (Source: The National Council on Compensation Insurance)
<P>
 Stress-related illnesses cost U.S. industry more than $150 billion annually. (Source: Dr. Peter Hanson, author of "The Joy of Stress")
<P>
 Job stress can triple the risk of high blood pressure and cause potentially dangerous physical changes to the heart. (Source: 1990 study by Cornell University Medical School)
<P>
At work or at home, stress is not caused by external forces, but rather by one's perceptions of events. One man's heart attack is another man's hobby. We have become a society of go and do - a double curse. For when we are going and doing, our bodies long to slow down and smell the rain. And when we do tarry, then we consider ourselves to be laggards.
<P>
"We need stress to keep ourselves motivated to get out of bed in the morning," says Anne M. Kowatch, R.N., manager of administration for Blue Cross of Western Pennsylvania's health promotion services. "The catch is, however, that we have to learn to manage it and know when it is too much."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Pump You Up</B></FONT SIZE><br>
So what exactly is stress?
<P>
"Physically, stress is a patterned physical reaction; the body is pumping itself up to cope with a stressful event or situation," says Joe Cvitkovic, Ph.D., of South Hills Health System. Physically, stress can increase the heart rate, bring on irritability and sleeplessness, even lead to complaints like asthma or muscle cramping. Emotionally, stress can cause depression, anxiety, disassociation and memory lapse. "Because they become so absorbed in stressful situations, some people actually detach from reality. Work performance decreases because it is difficult to concentrate on the job."
<P>
It is difficult, after digesting the litany of dire stress-induced reactions, to believe that stress is all in how you look at things. There is no doubt, however, that certain workaday  factors are practically guaranteed to cause stress: a down economy, an uncaring supervisor, unrelenting corporate policies. What do these things have in common? Workers cannot control them.
<P>
"I have never, in 20-plus years in psychology, talked to so many un-happy workers as in the past couple of years in the Pittsburgh area," says Cvitkovic. "Employees work under constant fear. There used to be a cradle-to-grave contract between employee and employer, and a feeling that their identity was part of that. Now, with massive layoffs, that identity is threatened."
<P>
Many companies recognize that and bring specialists like Cvitkovic into the work environment for sessions in change.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Talking Cure</B></FONT SIZE><br>
"People do have to talk, do have to process," says Cvitkovic. "A stress specialist can organize some discussion and help the company be sensitive to the kind of grieving that goes on as a result of downsizing. There are ways to organize our lives so our whole being and existence doesn't revolve around work - people need to rethink how they fit into the world of work and how they can function by getting enough healthy involvement in other parts of their lives."
<P>
This sounds an awful lot like the small group philosophy of the Pittsburgh Experiment, minus God. Balance, support, understanding - all of these are acknowledged to help decrease stress. And, of course, all of these could be introduced into the workplace before a catastrophic occurrence. But some say that companies are less willing to spend money on prevention in this area.
<P>
"Even five or six years ago, this was a bigger topic," says Debra Trachy, of Trachy Healthcare Management Co. "The issue is trying to divine a direct result, like: because there were x stress management classes they had fewer days of sick time."
<P>
Others say that stress prevention has not been abandoned by corporations, but that those efforts show up as more specific programs.
<P>
"For years, people were saying we've got to get rid of stress," says Paul Kowatch, manager of Allegheny General Hospital's Employee Assistance Program and president of the Pittsburgh chapter of the Employee Assistance Professional Association. "But now we've realized that stress is here to stay, and we are dealing with it in different ways, like providing elder care and child care resources for employees. But, again, it is hard to measure."
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Tangible Results</B></FONT SIZE><br>
Aerospace giant McDonnell Douglas Corp., St. Louis, however, did spend the time and money to evaluate the results of its EAP, and found that the program will save $5.1 million in reduced time off, health claims and attrition over three years.
<P>
"EAPs were started in the '40s as occupational alcohol programs," says Kowatch. "But there was a big change and growth in EAPs in the '80s, and now we place a lot of emphasis on stress, whether it comes from the job, family life or both. It makes good business sense - we spend half our waking hours at work, and it is hard to leave our personal problems out of the workplace."
<P>
One benchmark of corporate interest in prevention is that membership in Pittsburgh's local chapter of EAPA is up to nearly 100 members, from around 40 three or four years ago, according to Kowatch. Most EAPs educate employees on substance abuse, stress and the nature of change, and provide assessment, short-term counseling and referrals to other resources. Employees and family members (which AGH loosely defines as people with whom the employee has close personal relationships) can avail themselves of the services.
<P>
But education in stress doesn't mean just teaching coping skills any longer. AGH offers a bevy of seminars in areas that can lead to stress, or result from stress. Besides the usual advice on exercise and nutrition, employees have access to education on budgeting and the wise use of credit and forming healthy relationships. AGH also has the Quality Resource Center, a self-development office where employees can access a multitude of resources. AGH has a family loan program, which allows families to borrow money at low interest. Another program enables AGH employees to purchase homes on Pittsburgh's North Side at reduced cost, helping to finance half the down payment and most of the closing costs.
<P>
Companies are taking all sorts of innovative approaches to derailing stress. Providing child care and elder care are popular with hospitals and universities here, but less common among manufacturers and corpo-rations. One way that local employers have provided child care is to fund a consortium day care center downtown. City, state and foundation monies, along with contributions from corporations, provided the money needed to build the center at One Smithfield Street, which houses elder care, child care and the get-well room, a facility which will accept children with mild illnesses, so that parents do not miss work.
<P>
Another response to stress is the increasing number of companies instituting flex-time.
<P>
"Flex-time gives the employee more control and it works," says Rex Gatto, president of Gatto Training Associates, a local consulting firm. "The company says, in effect, we would like you to come when you are most productive. It can reduce time pressures, and treats the employee like an adult."
<P>
And that, it seems, is what every-one wants. Not only to be treated like an adult, but like a human, rather than a numbered cog.
<P>
"It doesn't take a lot to be sensitive to the employee and [what his behavior is telling you]," says Anne Kowatch of Blue Cross' Health Promotion Services. (If you caught it, yes, Paul Kowatch of AGH and Anne, are husband and wife.) "Sometimes, someone that is very vivacious will turn inward. Some people actually break down. Some people are sick a lot, with minor problems. Some will show decreased production. But sometimes, it is more subtle.
<P>
"I said hello to a person today and [she] said My grandmother fell and broke her hip last night.'   Obviously, that's going to be on her mind," Kowatch says. "So I offered to help her locate resources to help her solve her problem. Supervisors can be taught and encouraged to handle what's going on."
<P>
Programs aside, experts agree that one of the most effective stress reducers - understanding - is free.
<P>
"Corporations have become so impersonal that it almost paralyzes quality and empowerment, but they don't carry through. That makes stress worse."

To reduce stress and improve quality, Gatto says, just takes common sense.
<P>
"Ask employees What will cause us to have quality?' and listen," he says. "It will give them a sense of fulfilling their own destiny."
<P>
And nothing relieves stress more.

<B><h2>Steel City Going Soft</h2></B>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>While Pittsburgh has not quite shaken off its image as a steel town, it has quietly become one of the leading software centers in the country.</B></FONT SIZE><br><i>By John Schriefer</i>
<HR>
When you think of software, you think of Silicon Valley or Seattle; Pittsburgh still can conjure up thoughts of steel. But south-western Pennsylvania has developed into one of the top software producing areas in the United States. It now ranks fifth in software industry employment, just behind Silicon Valley, Boston, Seattle and the Austin-Dallas corridor in Texas.
<P>
Pittsburgh does not have any highly visible, dominant software companies, like Microsoft in Seattle. Nor is there an obvious connection between the software industry and a thriving microchip or computer industry. What this area does have, however, is technical and business resources, a strong engineering tradition and one of the top computer science universities in the world, Carnegie Mellon.
<P>
CMU's influence is enormous. The university has drawn federal software research to Pittsburgh. It has estab-lished major research institutions like the Software Engineering Institute and Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center.
<P>
Dennis Yablonsky, president of The Carnegie Group, says that Carnegie Mellon's "open attitude toward spin-offs" has been important. His company, for example, was founded in 1984 by four CMU professors who commercialized their academic research with funding from Digital Equipment Corp.
Pittsburgh's Fortune 500 companies have provided their own spin-off contributions to the software industry -  selling internally developed software to the outside. 
<P>
The number of big corporations headquartered in Pittsburgh gives the city good business support infrastruc-ture - accounting, law and financial firms - lacking in some other cities. Says Michael Pochan of Monroeville-based LeaseTek, "Pittsburgh is a smaller city with a lot of big city attributes."
<P>
"In the early days," remembers Pochan, "when we didn't have any money, [CPA firms like Ernst & Young] gave us a lot of free advice." Pochan and his partner also got advice from executives at established software firms.
<P>
The best known of these early software mentors was Glen Chatfield, founder and president of Duquesne Systems. The company, which was started in 1970 as a provider of software for IBM mainframe computers, was in the early 1980s one of the world leaders in the field. By 1989, Duquesne Systems had grown to $100 million in sales, and it was merged the following year to form Legent Corp., the world's second largest software company for IBM mainframes.
<P>
Chatfield took an active role in promoting the development of high-tech industries in the region, sharing his knowledge and experience with software start-ups and establishing a local high-tech venture capital fund. This tradition of involvement continues with other successful managers, including Yablonsky, taking leadership roles in new efforts to further grow the industry.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Success Breeds Success</B></FONT SIZE><br>
For example, Chatfield, Yablonsky and Alfred Spector (a former CMU professor who founded Transarc Corp. in 1989) are co-chairs of the Pittsburgh Software Business Forum founded last year to promote the exchange of ideas and information between local companies.
<P>
Besides actively promoting the industry, local software executives say Chatfield's success demonstrated to other budding entrepreneurs what could be achieved. Says Mike Bussler of Algor Inc., "It doesn't take many success stories to provide a kind of catalytic reaction."
<P>
Adds Yablonsky, "It's certainly im-portant to have a few big oaks. Up to the late 1980s, it was Duquesne Systems. That was probably the only company with over 50 employees. Now there are 10 to 12 with more than 100 employees."
<P>
Today, the objective is to promote the development of more oaks among the 300-plus mostly smaller companies already in the region. Yablonsky suggests that further development will occur as new companies spin off from the established leaders, and that industry employment will increase to 20,000 by the turn of the century from just under 10,000 today.
<P>
The only things holding back the industry from faster growth are a relative scarcity of venture capital to fund start-up ventures; few management professionals with experience in small, growing companies, and a traditionally conservative, nonentrepreneurial business culture.
<P>
"Twenty years ago," says Yablonsky, a Pittsburgh native lured back in 1987 to manage The Carnegie Group, "it defi-nitely was not OK to be an entrepre-neur. ... If you couldn't go to work for PPG or Westinghouse, and you had to start your own business, [people said,] Isn't that too bad.' " He contrasts that to Silicon Valley, where "not only is it OK to be an entrepreneur, it is desirable."
<P>
This is evidently less of a problem in the software sector than in other local industries, as eight new companies have already been formed by former Duquesne Systems/Legent employees, and four software start-ups have been started by ex-Carnegie Group people. 
<P>
Though entrepreneurship and a large number of spin-off companies is a good sign for future development in the region, spin-offs also present a challenge. Says attorney Gregory Jordan of Reed Smith Shaw & McClay, "If you allow people from within to simply copy and take [know-how of your product], and set up a direct competitor ... that is not a help to the region." 
<P>
Though most of the separations locally have been friendly, the employee and the former employer have had to negotiate a settlement in some cases. 
<P>
A more immediate and unique problem for Pittsburgh-area software start-ups in particular is capital availability. Theodore Glyptis, a partner in charge of the high technology practice at Coopers & Lybrand/Pittsburgh and an advisor to the Software Business Forum, notes that many companies today have to look for venture capital funding outside of Pittsburgh. And Yablonsky says many in the industry complain that it is relatively hard to get seed capital in Pittsburgh for early product development. (It is not so tough, he says, to find growth capital.)
<P>
Local software companies also have had to reach beyond the local market for executive talent. Says Yablonsky, "You don't have a lot of people with experience taking a $1 million company to a $50 mil-lion company, so [there's] a lot of recruiting from outside."
<P>
Despite these few potential bottlenecks, all signs point to further development in the Pittsburgh-area software industry. Companies that have staked out a place in global markets - like Algor, The Carnegie Group and LeaseTek - seem set for continued strong growth. New entries like Dasys, a start-up founded by three Carnegie Mellon Ph.D.s, indicate that there is plenty of  talent waiting to make a mark.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Seizing the Opportunity</B></FONT SIZE><br>
Monroeville-based LeaseTek is to leasing software what WordPerfect is to word processing and Lotus is to spread-sheets. Like these better-known software companies, LeaseTek's success is the re-sult of recognizing the market potential presented by the IBM PC and developing a unique, feature-rich application.
<P>
LeaseTek's products enable auto and equipment leasing companies to perform complex lease term analysis and to process credit applications on a standard personal computer. When partners Michael Pochan and Robert Culbertson got into the business in 1983, the first IBM PC had just been introduced, and leasing was only beginning to take off. The two CMU engineering graduates, who also attended the Graduate School of Industrial Administration together, quickly saw the potential of the IBM PC. 
<P>
"We decided that our goal was to become a software company, except we had no idea what our market would be," says Pochan. The partners had three false starts before hitting on the idea of leasing software  in October 1983.
<P>
To generate cash flow while they sought out a profitable product niche, the partners did consulting work. In the course of one consulting project for Algor, Mike Bussler, the president of Algor, mentioned that his car lessor was always complaining that he couldn't find any leasing software for his PC.
<P>
A little research convinced them that leasing was what they were looking for. "It is a complex problem that is tough to solve; the niche it is in is growing dramatically ... and there is hardly any competition," says Pochan.
<P>
By February 1984, they had delivered a first version of the product to Bussler's lessor. In the following months they marketed and refined it further for other local car dealers, including Bill Gray Leasing, which uses LeaseTek soft-ware to this day. Pochan and Culbertson continued to do consulting work to generate cash flow - as the software package "didn't just sell 1 million copies the first day," Pochan says.
<P>
For the first year, all sales were based on word-of-mouth referrals, including the first sale outside of Pittsburgh (in Cleveland). Then, in 1985, Pochan and Culbertson attended a leasing conference in Atlantic City and hooked up with New York/New Jersey lessors and national leasing associations. That marked the beginning of a fast growth phase that landed LeaseTek on Fortune magazine's 1991 list of the 500 fastest growing privately held companies.
<P>
Today, LeaseTek sells its software in 10 countries, mostly in Europe. In addi-tion to English, there are Spanish, Italian and French language versions of its software packages, which now include six closely related programs.
<P>
According to Pochan, Europe accounted for about 10% of LeaseTek's predicted sales of $2.8 million in 1994.  In 1995, he says, it will account for half. In anticipation of fast growth, this quarter LeaseTek will open a sales and support office in the United Kingdom. It has recently doubled its office space, and planned on hiring 15 new employees, bringing the staff count to 50.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>The Indirect Route</B></FONT SIZE><br>
Algor founder Mike Bussler got into the software business by a roundabout route. Like LeaseTek, Algor anticipated the PC revolution, and made the most of it.
<P>
At about the same time as Bussler put the LeaseTek founders on the scent of what became their market niche, he was in the process of transforming Algor from an engineering services bureau into a package software company. Algor's original software products - there are now 80 separate modules - grew out of computer time-share services it had been providing to Pittsburgh-area engineering firms since 1977. Bussler says he began writing custom software programs for his customers, and "sort of inadvertently developed packages" that could be used for any number of general engineering applications. In 1985, Algor translated its software to run on Digital Equipment Corp.'s VAX computers and also IBM PCs. "Putting this stuff on PCs was revolutionary," Bussler says.
<P>
Still, the software was not an immediate hit. Says Bussler, "Most people thought it wasn't a real serious thing, to try to do this on PCs." That changed when IBM introduced more powerful second- and third-generation PCs beginning in 1986. The PCs could now handle higher demands, giving Algor a jump on the engineering soft-ware market. 
<P>
Algor's software today enables engineers using a standard personal computer to predict how a product they are designing will perform under real-world stresses. Among products designed using Algor software are Black & Decker's Dustbuster and Nautilus exercise equipment. The software was also used recently by engineers restoring the 111-year-old Smithfield Street Bridge. 
<P>
Though some of its competitors are billion-dollar companies, Algor has maintained a comfortable share of the engineering software market. Bussler sees one key to keeping ahead of the field. "It won't do to be competitive locally - that's not good enough. To be competitive nationally - that's not good enough. You have to be competitive globally. That means you need the best people you can find, period."
<P>
Algor has found those people - currently 75 - in southwestern Pennsylvania, elsewhere in the United States and overseas. The company's customer base is skewed even more to the outside: Only about 100 of Algor's 10,000 customers are in Pittsburgh.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Continuing Tradition</B></FONT SIZE><br>
Most of the software coming out of Pittsburgh today is targeted at a specific product niche. Many others, however, are for more esoteric engi-neering and production functions.
<P>
Consider Dasys Inc., a company started in 1991 that develops software to automate the design of electronic circuits. Explains President David Springer, the software allows designers to describe what they want the circuit to do, and the program figures out how to do it, either by designing a custom integrated circuit (like the microchip that controls your computer's video display) or many ICs in combination. The program determines a sequence of functions to be performed by the circuit, selects components and then provides the wiring design.
<P>
Like their longer-established associates in the Pittsburgh software community, Springer and his partners see nothing but opportunity selling to the world software made in the cradle of the American steel industry.     

<HR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Selected Makers</B></FONT SIZE><br>
There are scores of interesting software makers here in southwestern Pennsylvania. Stephen David, president of Applied Quality Methods Inc., is developing software for implementing total quality management. He says the idea was originally conceived by Steve Heilman, founder and director of Medrad, and initially was healthcare oriented. Now the idea is to have TQM within reach of everyone. "It's for reducing costs and improving quality at the same time," says David. The company plans to market the package nationally next year.
<P>
Much of the software developed here is healthcare related although developments abound in other industries and for personal computers as well. Several major insurance companies and Fortune 500 in-house legal departments are reviewing a system developed by Carol Ross, president and CEO of Lecor Inc. Over the past four years, Ross has invested more than $1 million in R&D for the Lecor System. The program is intended to dramatically reduce legal costs associated with litigation management. The system recently produced a comprehensive billing report for a Fortune 500 company in eight minutes, compared to the two days the process previously took. Ross says the law firm management package can reduce mass representation defense costs by 30% to 70%.

<IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="../pictures/publisher.gif"><FONT SIZE=+2><B> Behind the Scenes</B></FONT SIZE><i> By Linda A. Dickerson</i>
<HR>
Last year, the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre produced a brilliant performance of Cinderella. For me, this production was a poignant reminder of the arts community's plight.
<P>
The arts community is one of the most underappreciated segments of the broader community. In many ways, its situation is analogous to Cinderella's. Employing almost 9,500 individuals full time with a payroll of over $2.3 million, the arts sector is a significant contributor to the region's economic vitality.
<P>
Those who attend the fine performances or exhibits of the more than 150 arts groups in the area appreciate the art form but not necessarily the arts organization. Arts organizations spend over  $270 million dollars annually. Studies estimate that beyond their direct expenditures, arts organizations generate $235 million in spending on ancillary activities such as hotel stays, dining out and parking.
<P>
One can quibble about the exact amounts, but not about the order of magnitude. Arts organizations from the Pittsburgh Symphony to the River City Brass Band to the Tuesday Musical Club are critical to the region's fiscal well-being. Apart from their immense contributions to this area's psyche through the enjoyment they provide to more than 12 million patrons, arts groups are a key component of the region's economic framework.
<P>
Consequently, we must work cooperatively to solidify the arts community's current position. As arts organizations flourish, the ambiance of the community as a whole improves.
<P>
Often viewed as the domain of only the rich and famous, arts organizations are rarely recognized for the enormity and value of their overall contribution. Children in the Hill District have the same senses to be awakened by the melodious tones of the American Wind Symphony as do those from Sewickley. Senior citizens enjoy the dance of the sugarplum fairies as much as a child on a first grade field trip to The Benedum. Art forms are a universal language.
<P>
Arts organizations can and should embrace an entire community, reaching out to every nook and cranny to engage all people in experiences unavailable through any other means.
<P>
Despite arts organizations' proven track record of engaging eclectic groups of people in their volunteer bases and their audiences, we still treat arts organizations largely as unwanted stepchildren.
<P>
Perhaps it's time to invite Cinderella to the ball. By nurturing our arts community, we ensure a vibrant, energetic and alive downtown, and we enhance everyone's quality of life.

<I>ER Index is compiled by Doug Thomas, vice president and director of research at the HomeState Pennsylvania Growth Fund in Lancaster.</I>
<HR>
<P>
Sharp declines in four of the companies included in the Executive Report Index contri-buted to a decline of 4.3% for the month ended Dec. 9. In spite of the poor showing, the ER Index remains well ahead of the S&P 500, which declined 3.4% during the same period. Since inception on Aug. 15, the ER Index is up 0.2% while the S&P 500 has lost more than 3% of its value.
<P>
Johnstown America led the list of losers, down a whopping 43%, as some of its analysts cut estimates and expressed concern over the company's continuing string of disap-pointments. Nevertheless, the company says business, as measured by backlog and new orders, continues to be strong and that sell-off is unwarranted.
<P>
American Eagle Outfitters, which bears no relation to the airline of similar name, has coincidentally experienced a few crashes of its own. The company lost 26% of its value during the past month, following a decline in enthusiasm for the specialty apparel chain's growth prospects. Alex. Brown & Sons cut its rating of the stock, citing weak same-store sales figures and less than sterling holiday sales. But the bottom line is still healthy, and profits from the holiday selling season are expected to be up more than 40% from last year.
<P>
Mellon Bank was down more than 13%, following the company's disclosure that it would take a fourth quarter charge of $130 mil-lion, or 88 cents per share, for losses on derivatives tied to interest rates. Since August, the stock has dropped from $38 per share to $30.75. Seeking to bolster its price, Mellon announced in late November that its board had authorized a repurchase of up to 3 million shares.
<P>
Kennametal also declined by nearly 13%, as concern over cyclical stocks weighed on the market. Kennametal is experiencing strong demand for its products, and the potential exists for positive earnings surprises over the next several quarters, as pricing and margins both improve. The market, however, is clearly concerned about the effect of interest rates on industrial demand.
<P>
Other local companies in the news:

<P>
<DL>
<LI>Fore Systems continued its torrid pace, tacking on another 17%. Since Aug. 15, Fore has doubled, from $30 per share to nearly $60 per share, as analysts continue to raise their expectations about the company's portfolio of asynchronous transfer mode products. In mid-November, Fore announced a licensing deal with Alantec Corp., a leader in local area network switching, that should extend Fore's reach into the networking marketplace.
<LI>Alcoa announced a two-for-one stock split and raised its quarterly cash dividend 12.5%, effective this month. Alcoa continues to benefit from higher demand, higher prices and steadily declining inventories of aluminum ingot. In November, the company announced it would raise prices of can sheet by approximately 50%.
<LI>Amsco, in the midst of a turnaround, recently eliminated 160 salaried positions throughout its operations, including some in Erie and Pittsburgh. The company, which employs 3,150 worldwide, is expected to announce details of its restructuring this month. Under the leadership of new president and CEO Dan Barry, Amsco has already taken several significant steps to regain some measure of credibility. In November, Amsco withdrew its Food and Drug Administration application for a new vaporized hydrogen peroxide sterilizer, after it became clear that approval was not likely. The company's plan is to return to the drawing board and resubmit the product to the FDA sometime this year.
<LI>Tuscarora Inc., the New Brighton-based packaging manufacturer, reported record first-quarter earnings for the period ended Nov. 30. Net sales rose nearly 33% while net income jumped almost 52%. Earnings per share rose to 41 cents vs. 27 cents. The company attributed the super results to significant growth in its consumer electronics, high-tech, major appliance and automotive markets. Year-to-date orders are up nearly 40%. The company's recent acquisitions are also starting to contribute. Tuscarora raised its semiannual cash dividend to 11 cents per share, from 10 cents, the company's 21st consecutive annual increase.
<LI>Astrotech reported its performance is improving, with income from continuing operations more than doubling for the year ended Sept. 30. The company's acquisitions of Rubbaglas and Brown-Minneapolis Tank helped contribute to top-line growth, with revenues for the year increasing to $68.7 mil-lion from $39.5 million last year. Income from continuing operations was 9 cents per share for the year, vs. 7 cents in 1993. Astrotech has roughly 1.7 million shares more outstanding than a year ago, primarily because of its acquisitions. The company, whose products and services are targeted at the construction and maintenance of above-ground storage tanks, derives much of its business from the petroleum industry, and is aggressively focusing on the wastewater treatment, agricultural and pulp and paper markets. High utilization rates and environmental issues at refineries, both domestic and international, are fueling storage tank maintenance spending.

<FONT SIZE=+2><B> Stressing and Obsessing</B></FONT SIZE><br>
Job insecurity is the No. 1 source of stress in the workplace today, according to Robert Half International of Menlo Park, Calif. A survey conducted by an independent research firm polled 150 executives from the nation's 1,000 largest companies.
<P>
"Despite the economic recovery, there is still a lingering uncertainty in the workplace," says Max Messmer, chairman and CEO of Robert Half. "Staffing cuts have been so deep in recent years that even those employees who have kept their jobs remain uneasy."
<P>
Messmer advises companies to be open with employees when belt tightening becomes necessary. "Managers who try to protect workers by hiding bad news are setting themselves up for disaster. It is the uncertainty that causes the most stress," Messmer says.
<HR>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B> All Stressed Out</B></FONT SIZE><br>
Executives were asked, "Which of the following would you say is the No. 1 cause of stress in the workplace?"
<PRE>
Cause				Percent responding
Job insecurity			41%
Understaffing			32
Personality conflicts		9
External competitive pressures	8
Changing technology		7
Other				3

The premiere of "The Working Wine Guide" was published by David R. DeSimone of Oakland last fall. DeSimone's goal is to highlight the best wine values available in western Pennsylvania at Pennsylvania Wine and Spirit Shops or through local wholesalers.
<P>
"Instead of using numerical ratings, we make specific, practical recommendations based on quality of production and value for the listed price," he says. The guide is not affiliated with any winery, wine distributor or the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board, and DeSimone hopes people will pay $40 for the publication's bimonthly "unbiased opinion."
<P>
The first issue features a regular column on cigar smoking by Marc Adams of South Side's Bloom Cigar Co. Sales of premium cigars increased by 24% from 1989 to 1993, according to the Cigar Association of America in Washington, D.C.
<P>
Nationally, wine consump-tion is down, according to figures published by The Wall Street Journal. In 1993, table-wine shipments were down 3%, after a slight increase in 1992, following a 10-year slide.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Take It Private</B></FONT SIZE><br>
According to The Commonwealth Foundation of Harrisburg, Westmoreland County is one of the state's leaders in privatization. In 1992, the county contracted out $27 million of its $181 million operating budget to third-party providers.
<P>
Terry Marolt, Westmoreland County minority commissioner, believes privatization is popular because it saves tax funds.
<P>
"The most intelligent way to administer privatization is to get the government's role reduced and use administration more to distribute funds," says Marolt. "It works."
<P>
Marolt says about $20 mil-lion went to human services programs, with $17.9 million of it going to the mental health and retardation program. Other privatization programs included road maintenance, alcohol/drug treatment, cafeteria, janitorial, laundry, security, transportation and pharmaceutical services.
<P>
The county will continue to privatize where possible.

<FONT SIZE=+2><B> Making Way for the Busway</B></FONT SIZE><br>
A U.S. Congressional conference committee approved $30 million for the Port Authority's airport busway/Wabash facility, according to the Allegheny County commissioners. The recommendation must get full House and Senate approval.
<P>
Phase one is an 8.1-mile project which includes a seven-mile bus-only roadway going from Carnegie to Station Square, where it will link with a new 1.1-mile HOV route via the Wabash Tunnel. From there, it will cross a new bridge over the Mon River and enter town on Fort Pitt Boulevard at Market Street.
<P>
PAT expects this to open in 1997, prior to the closing of the Fort Pitt Bridge and Tunnel.

<FONT SIZE=+2><B> Teeming With Teamwork</B></FONT SIZE><br>
"Inside Teams," a new book by two execs at Development Dimensions International of Bridgeville and a consultant, chronicles the success of teamwork at 20 organizations, including three from around here.
<P>
The authors, Richard Wellins, William Byham and George Dixon, were particularly struck by three common factors:

 payoffs from 
teams are consistent across the organizations;
 the impact in many cases is in the range of 50% to 100%;
 teams improve many facets of the organization's business from quality to turnover.
<P>
At DDI there has been a 43% reduction in client-reported errors, and an increase of 65% in revenue per employee. At Mine Safety Appliances Co., there has been a 110%-plus increase in productivity.
<P>
Westinghouse Electric reports that teamwork has cut cycle time from 12 weeks to two, work-in-progress inventories by 65%, rework in half and product cost by 60%.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B> New Business</B></FONT SIZE><br>
GCS Service Inc. of Danbury, Conn., has opened a Pittsburgh office for food service equipment maintenance. The first franchise of North Hills-based Betsy Ann Chocolates has opened in South Hills Village. Jay Design Almond Oatmeal Soap is operating in Oakland.

<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Financial Markets--A Turning Point</B> </FONT SIZE> <i> By Patrick M. Mullen</i><p>
The financial markets are in the midst of funda-mental change. Like many investors, you may be experiencing some anxiety about the recent volatility in the stock and bond markets, which is the result of this ongoing change. Recent declines have probably caused you some concern about where the markets are headed - and what it all means to your investments.
<P>
To answer that, we need to look at the big picture. A careful reading of economic data suggests that stocks and bonds are experiencing a near-term correction (a temporary downward movement in price), not a bear market. After the correction has run its course, low inflation and moderate growth should help stocks resume their long-term upward climb this year. It appears that market turning points are approaching. These investment-related turning points are rarely heralded by bells and whistles. Those who wait may find that they have missed them - and the investment opportunities they bring. That's why it makes sense to reevaluate your investment portfolio now with an eye toward developing a financial plan that strives to protect your assets from any remaining market volatility over the near term and prepare for the turning points that we believe are approaching.
<P>
Uncertainty regarding the economy and the Federal Reserve's monetary policy may cause more turbulence in the financial markets over the coming months. Therefore, keep this rule of thumb in mind when reviewing your investments: Remain focused on your financial goals and maintain a long-term perspective.
<P>
Since near-term turbulence ran its course during the second half of 1994, low inflation and moderate economic growth should help stock and bond prices resume their long upward climb this year. Keep in mind that because individual securities do not always mirror broader market trends, they may reach their turning points earlier or later than the overall market. Since no one can predict precisely when the turning points will occur in the various markets, you need to prepare now to take advantage of buying opportunities when and if they occur.
<P>
Of course, each individual investor has different objectives and different financial resources. Obviously, not all investments are right for everybody. With that in mind, here are some things you may wish to consider when putting together an investment strategy that can help you attain your goals over the long term.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Fixed Income Investments</B> </FONT SIZE>
Bonds may well recover before stocks do. Therefore, fixed-income investors should begin to put their money to work now, rather than trying to anticipate the exact turning point in the bond market. In the taxable sectors, focus on investments in intermediate-term bonds in the five- to 15-year range. In the tax-exempt sector, municipal bonds continue to represent one of the most attractive areas of the fixed-income marketplace.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Cash Investments</B> </FONT SIZE>
Although short-term savings investments outperformed stocks and bonds during the first half of last year, that is not expected to continue. As soon as long-term investors are convinced that inflation is not a threat to sustainable economic growth, stocks and bonds may begin to provide greater returns once again. Begin to move idle cash into intermediate-term, fixed-income securities to take advan-tage of higher yields and the potential for capital appreciation as long-term rates decline. Also, you may choose to use higher yielding substitutes for cash whenever possi-ble (for example, one- to three-year U.S. Treasury securities).
 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Stocks</B> </FONT SIZE>
While stocks are expected to resume their upward climb this year, further declines may occur in response to shifts to a somewhat tighter monetary policy. Any such declines should probably be seen as the final volatile stages of a temporary correction, not the start of a persistent bear market. Therefore, it appears that any short-term price weakness may offer buying opportunities to those willing and ready to act.
<P>
Because specific stocks and sectors that led the market advances of the 1980s and early 1990s are not expected to be the leaders of this year and beyond, the first step is to eliminate those holdings that are not anticipated to participate in the gains of the next phase of the market cycle. There are several long-term investment themes within the stock market that should produce opportunities for profitable investment in the months ahead:
<P>
<DL>
<LI>Stocks with stronger-than-average earnings growth are companies and industries that are growing more quickly and consistently than the overall economy.
<LI>Yield plus stocks pay above-average dividends and are often more resistant to temporary market corrections than pure growth stocks.
<LI>Defensive stocks offer the potential for long-term growth in rising markets and a certain degree of protection during market downturns.
<LI>Stocks of U.S. companies with exposure to European markets may now be poised for a significant advance. Some Latin American and Southeast Asian stocks may be attrac-tive candidates for long-term investments.

<b><h2>Reinventing Banking</h2></B><FONT SIZE=+1><b>PNC Bank Corp. has reorganized into a financial services conglomerate to battle the competition.</FONT SIZE></b><br>
<i>By Richard Bierck</i>
<HR>
Five years ago, PNC Bank Corp. decided not to act like a bank any longer - at least, not in the traditional sense.
<P>
Beset by voracious competition, PNC, then called Pittsburgh Financial Corp., reorganized to battle a horde of financial services companies.
After all, that's how nonbank competition had been operating to drain bank vaults of American wealth. In 1984, 50% of the nation's assets were in banks. That figure has dropped to 30%.
<P>
"We don't even talk about being in the banking business anymore. ... Now we're a financial services conglomerate," says Thomas H. O'Brien, PNC's chairman and CEO.
<P>
"Before [the reorganization], we were trying to give customers the products we had. They didn't happen to be the products that customers truly wanted."
<P>
From his corner office on the 30th floor of One PNC Plaza in downtown Pittsburgh, with his back to a panoramic view of Mount Washington and the three rivers, O'Brien likens banking's plight in recent years to that of department stores.
<P>
"High-quality, low-cost competitors were coming in, targeting niches, and department stores were getting picked off. Only strong depart-ment stores that were well-managed could survive.
<P>
"We were doing fine against Mellon [the nation's 22nd largest banking company] and Integra, who were good competitors. But there were Fidelity Funds, Merrill Lynch, GMAC - they were the competition. It could be characterized as a fist fight between banks. Meanwhile, someone is sneaking around and taking stuff out of the store."
<P>
The move to reorganize was dynamic by the standards of a stodgy industry still fettered by traditionalism.
<P>
"It was extraordinarily challenging," says O'Brien of the reorganization process. "A lot of banks haven't elevated themselves above banking. If you can't compete head to head with nonbank providers, you're going to lose the majority of your customers."
<P>
<font size =+2><B>A Dying Breed</B></font size><BR>
Michael Durante, a banking analyst with McDonald & Co. in Cleveland, says: "Banks as we know them are a dying breed. A lot of bankers are sitting on their hands. PNC has been trying to posture itself as more of a broad-based financial services provider."
<P>
Since the reorganization, PNC has earned a reputation among analysts like Durante for efficiencies that keep costs low and earnings up against a backdrop of mounting assets. In 1972, PNC had $2.1 billion in total assets. Today, it has about $64 billion, making it the 12th largest banking company in the country.
<P>
Aided by low interest rates that spurred mortgage lending and refinancing, PNC achieved earnings of $2.36 per share in 1992 and $3.14 per share in 1993. Earnings for the first half of 1994 were $1.66 per share, up from $1.42 for the same period of 1993.
<P>
But this growth halted in the third quarter, when the company reported earnings of 79 cents per share, down from 92 cents for the third quarter of 1993.
<P>
One reason for the decline in earnings, according to PNC executives, was a $72.5 million gain on the sale of securities in the third quarter of 1993 that produced a comparative peak.
<P>
But they don't dispute that the primary cause was a surge in interest rates that depressed the value of PNC's mortgage-backed securities, catching the company off guard.
<P>
"The increase [in interest rates] was more sudden than most economists were projecting," says Jonathan Williams, vice president of corporate and public affairs.
<P>
Bob Kanters, senior vice president and director of research for Legg Mason Wood Walker in Pittsburgh, says PNC wasn't "positioned for the rising interest rate environment. ... Some banks would have played that more conservatively."
<P>
Kanters says that in "winding out of these positions" by replacing the fixed-income securities with variable-rate assets, PNC "had to incur some losses along the way."
<P>
Durante adds: "They purposely took the losses this quarter to reduce their interest rate going forward."
<P>
When the third quarter report was issued, rapid selling pushed PNC's stock to a new 52-week low on the New York Stock Exchange. Durante and Kanters attribute this to the glandular reactions of institutional investors.
<P>
Kanters believes the poor third quarter performance "has made us mark time for the near-termer. ... But for anyone looking at the next six months or couple of years, it's not a problem. Over the long haul, this has been a superb bank. Their efficiency ratios are among the best in the country."
<P>
<font size =+2><B>Workhorse Performance</B></font size><BR>
While Durante predicts thoroughbred performance from some other bank stocks in the next two years, he views PNC as more of a workhorse.
<P>
"PNC is more of a defensive stock. There's not a lot of risk. PNC is one of the most efficient banks that we follow, and has been for some time. They do very well on the cost side, and that has enabled them to make acquisitions."
<P>
Acquisitions have allowed PNC to venture further into fee-producing services, a realm less subject to the vagaries of interest-rate shifts than more traditional banking endeavors. Thirty-five percent of PNC's total revenues came from fees in the third quarter, up from 29% for the same period in 1993.
<P>
The company has directed much of its management energy toward increasing that fig-ure by concentrating on fee-intensive lines of business targeted for growth, including mort-gage servicing, cash management for corporate customers, and securities brokerage and underwriting. Recent acquisitions in asset management are also expected to boost fee income.
<P>
The five-year plan PNC adopted at the outset of its reorganization included provisions to expand the mortgage portfolio gradually. But as it turned out, there was nothing at all gradual about the company's mortgage business growth.
<P>
In 1993, PNC received a telephone call from an investment banker concerning the availability of Sears, Roebuck & Co.'s mortgage banking unit, including a $27.2 billion mortgage servicing portfolio - triple the size of PNC's.
<P>
In November the same year, PNC acquired the business for $328 million, a move that would make it the nation's fourth largest originator of mortgage loans and the 10th largest mortgage servicer. This put PNC Mortgage in a rarefied atmosphere that includes Fleet Financial Group, Norwest Corp. and General Motors Corp. The previous year, PNC had originated mortgages totaling $1.9 billion, compared with the Sears unit's $11.8 billion.
<P>
"We didn't envision this," says O'Brien, explaining that the company had expected a more piecemeal mortgage growth.
<P>
The purchase came amid a spate of mortgage company acquisitions by commercial banks such as BankAmerica Corp. of San Francisco, the nation's second largest banking company, and Barnett Banks Inc. of Jacksonville, Fla., the 24th largest. Experts attributed this to the need of mortgage companies to get better prices than those offered on the stock market, where their values were falling because of dwindling refinancing business. These companies were worth more to large commercial banks already processing high volumes.
<P>
While Sears executives said that $328 mil-lion was about what they'd hoped for, analysts view the price as cheap indeed. O'Brien declines to reveal the Sears' initial asking price, saying only that it was "extraordinarily attractive."
<P>
Especially attractive, that is, for the economies attainable by a bank holding company that was already crunching mortgage numbers on a gargantuan scale.
<P>
"It's a business we're going to be in forever, and we have the volume to justify it," says James E. Rohr, president. "We used to have branches with [mortgage] processing. ... Historically, you couldn't shrink processing [cost] numbers enough. When volumes go to pot, I'm stuck."
<P>
Formerly, PNC Mortgage Corp. had 40 processing centers covering 32 states. It has reduced those 40 to seven, Rohr says, "because we can manage seven without losing critical mass. With 40, we couldn't."
<P>
Greater Pittsburgh is one of PNC's remaining processing centers, with facilities in Bethel Park. Sears had an office in Wexford, but it has been consolidated into the Bethel Park operation.
<P>
<font size =+2><B>BlackRock Bombshell</B></font size><BR>
In June, PNC Bank dropped its second bombshell in two years when it announced an agreement to buy New York-based BlackRock Financial Management LP for $240 million in cash and notes.
<P>
The deal, which was expected to close at the end of 1994, was to increase PNC's assets under management by $21 billion to $75 billion, making it the nation's sixth largest bank money manager.
<P>
While the BlackRock deal was big news for asset managers, it was regarded as less surprising than the Sears purchase, for consolidations in the mutual fund industry were running apace. An example was Mellon Bank Corp.'s agreement to buy Dreyfus Corp.
<P>
The sheer size of the Sears and BlackRock deals, and their rapid succession, have increased PNC's profile as a behemoth that takes care of its competitors by consuming them. Between 1991 and 1994, the company acquired 10 banking companies in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Kentucky.
<P>
Richard C. Caldwell, executive vice president for investment management and trust, says it only took two or three months to strike the BlackRock deal. "It was a modern courtship."
<P>
Another key area of fee income is corporate banking. In 1993, PNC's earnings from services to large businesses (those with annual revenues of more than $250 million) increased marginally, to 47% from 44% the year before. Large customers include Westinghouse, USX, Proctor & Gamble, General Electric and Mobil Oil.
<P>
But revenues from services to mid-sized companies (between $5 million and $250 mil-lion in annual revenues) were a different story. These earnings increased from $101 million to $223 million, boosting year-end profits from 18% to 40% in the middle market alone. This resulted in a profit margin of 42%, up from 23% in 1992, on corporate banking as a whole.
<P>
In the first half of 1994, earnings from middle-market corporate banking services increased about 20% over the same period in 1993. Customers in this market have included businesses involved in healthcare, cable television, cellular telephone and mining.
<P>
Among the services PNC sells these specialized clients is cash management. Also known as treasury management, these services center on handling payments to and from their clients' customers.
<P>
In today's competitive environment, says Bruce E. Robbins, executive vice president for corporate banking, "country club banking is dead. That's when you bank with somebody because they belong to the same country club. ... Corporate customers [today] expect excellent execution."
<P>
One service gaining popularity is the electronic lock box. "We take data and format it onto mag tape. The customer gets it electronically, so it updates their receivables instantly," says Rohr. "What treasury management is going to is information."
<P>
<font size =+2><B>Securities and Underwriting</B></font size><BR>
Another growth area for PNC has been securities brokerage and underwriting, which brought earnings of $32 million in 1993 with a 37% profit margin, up from $21 million and 35% in 1992. In the first half of 1994, earnings were $14 million, compared with $13 million in the same period of 1993.
<P>
One source of this growth in underwriting revenues has been the access to new bond issue clients in municipal, healthcare and higher education afforded by acquisitions in the East, including those in Delaware and Kentucky. "We've been doing it for a long time in Pittsburgh, and now we're doing it across the 800-mile platform of PNC," says Rohr.
<P>
Moreover, he continues, handling a major bond issue for such clients is a good entry that can lead to cross-selling relationships for other lines of business.
<P>
When the company restructured itself, the idea was to take aim at financial services vendors by becoming more like them: more focused, more flexible and more marketing-oriented.
<P>
PNC has since aimed this new structure at brokers. "God knows, plenty of brokers are in our business trying to snake our customers," says Rohr, a Cleveland native who, like O'Brien, is a Notre Dame alumnus. "They don't have the constraints" that banks do.
<P>
Another investment banking function for the company is mergers and acquisitions, an area that has shown a flurry of activity in late 1994.
<P>
While PNC executives hardly express an aversion to handling massive mergers of the 1980s variety, they indicate that an openness to such business from smaller companies has served them well in the downsizing '90s.
<P>
In no arena has PNC's restructuring had more visible impact than in retail banking. Without consolidation, branches, including those of newly acquired banks, would have totaled more than 720 by late 1994. PNC has limited itself to 621. The bricks-and-mortar reductions, common in the industry of late, are demographic in design. Says O'Brien: "Four out of 10 cus-tomers prefer never to go inside a branch."
<P>
PNC's market research further shows that the majority of the retail customers who prefer automated teller machines and telephone banking are between 25 and 45 years old - the age bracket that borrows the most money.
<P>
In the coming years, the company expects the public penchant for remote banking to increase as young people comfortable with it enter the work force. Meanwhile, as customers now between 25 and 45 age, their preference for remote banking isn't expected to change.
<P>
Such goes the rationale for PNC's decision to expand its telephone banking center at One Oliver Plaza in downtown Pittsburgh, a building where PNC leases space next to its two headquarters structures. Previously, PNC Bank Corp. had one telephone center in each of its eight markets. The center being expanded in downtown Pittsburgh will consolidate these eight into one center that will employ about 450 people. The current staff in Pittsburgh totals 88.
<P>
Scheduled for completion at the end of 1995, the center will provide expanded service from what is now available in the eight existing centers. PNC is touting the new center as being capable of taking care of 95% of all customers on their first call, as opposed to the 50% currently achieved.
<P>
"We'll be able to handle a loan transaction by phone, followed up by mail, and people won't even have to go into a branch office to close. We're doing that now in Chicago," says A. William Schenck III, executive vice president for retail banking.
<P>
"The cheapest way to deal with us is by mail or phone. Over time, fees will vary with the cost of access, and this will drive the shape of our distribution system, evolving toward a hub with fewer and fewer branches."
<P>
<font size =+2><B>Enhanced Marketing Skills</B></font size><BR>
At the same time, Schenck says, PNC bankers are developing new ways to enhance marketing skills within each branch, seeking to develop a "highly charged" sales atmosphere.
<P>
"What we're moving to is a process where, every day, we have a sales meeting in the branch and talk about what goals we have and how we're going to go about achieving them. Then the next day we have another meeting and talk about how we did. Then we trade information back and forth. Wherever we do this, there seems to be a tremendous increase in sales. ...
<P>
"We don't think of ourselves as bankers. We're pragmatic and marketing-oriented. ... In the old days, we had autonomous business units with their own sets of customers. They didn't necessarily talk to each other. You can't do that anymore."
<P>
Upper management's encouragement for managers from different lines of business to interact has resulted in an organization whose managers know each other better.
<P>
This made it all the more devastating when six PNC executives were killed on Sept. 8 in the crash of USAir Flight 427. The Boeing 737, which had taken off from Chicago, suddenly corkscrewed to the ground six miles from Pittsburgh International Airport, killing all 132 people aboard.
<P>
"It affects the entire company, not just [the] Pittsburgh [offices]. Some of these people were known across the company," says Rohr. After the crash, individuals from various departments went and spent weekends with the families.
<P>
"We immediately provided counseling for families and employee groups, and financial counseling by an outside firm that handles this in these types of circumstances," says Rohr.
<P>
In memory of the six employees, PNC set up a nonprofit foundation to make education funds available for children of victims and to qualifying children of employees. Also, the company plans to erect a memorial marker in PNC Plaza, the fulcrum for One PNC Plaza and its newer 34-story companion, Two PNC Plaza.
<P>
These two buildings, along with surrounding structures where PNC leases space, encompass management operations over 23,000 employees nationwide.
<P>
While the past year or two have been "externally driven," O'Brien says, he sees the coming months as a time to work on training new employees. "They all have to be trained in a whole new way - segmenting customers."
<P>
But he doesn't rule out further acquisitions.
"Traditional banks," he says, are "less of a priority" than businesses more centered on investments.
<P>
As baby boomers age, they borrow less and invest more, O'Brien says, and a key goal of PNC is to tap that wealth through its targeted lines of business.
<P>
"We're looking at businesses that are growing. Mutual funds, money markets - we want to see that continue to grow. That's the type of thing we would probably pursue."

<b><h2>Hey, Beer Here</h2></B><FONT SIZE=+1><b> Local brewers are staying alive by serving local tastes.</FONT SIZE></b><br>
<i>By Patricia Berti-Sullivan</i>
<HR>
Both nationally and locally it is a highly competitive industry that's not for the faint of heart. It's fast-paced, and you must be able to introduce new products to the marketplace. After an initial surge, however, many of these products will fall by the wayside becoming nothing more than a fad to the consumer and a footnote in company archives. After years of growth, your market becomes stagnant and the only way for you to boost market share is to lure customers away from your competitors. What industry are we talking about here? Could it be the computer industry? No. Fashion? No. Surprise! It's the beer industry, an industry that continues to evolve. And the big guys and little guys alike are pouring it on in hopes that you'll be pouring their brand.
<P>
Nationally, the major players haven't changed. A handful of brewing companies still ring up the majority of sales. In fact, the largest players - Anheuser-Busch, Miller Brewing and Coors Brewing - control about 75% of the $6 billion domestic market. That leaves everyone else - smaller national brewing companies, regional breweries, microbreweries and brewpubs - competing for 25% of the beer drinking public.
<P>
This region has a rich brewing history, thanks, at least in part, to German immigrants who brought their love of beer with them when they settled here in the 1800s. Today, western Pennsylvania is in many ways a microcosm of what is happening nationally in the industry. From the giants to the brewpubs, the players have recognized the consumer's thirst for something different, and they're all scrambling to quench it.
<P>
<font size =+2><B>Stealing Market Share</B></font size><BR>
One way companies lure drinkers is through line extensions: A few years ago, it was dry beer. Sales for dry beer have gone flat, but ice beer has moved in as the latest hot product. "With beer sales being flat overall in this country, you have to steal market share. The way they've been doing it is through new product gimmicks or line extensions," explains Tom Pastorius, president and founder of Pennsylvania Brewing Co., a microbrewery located in the former Eberhardt & Ober Brewery in Pittsburgh's Troy Hill neighborhood. The brewery's flagship product is Penn Pilsner, but it also produces a number of other specialty beers.
<P>
Larger area brewers say that such line extensions are the lifeblood of the industry. If you don't introduce new products, you won't be around a few years down the line. Brewing companies feel peer pressure to imitate what their competitors are doing or risk being left behind, according to Robert Caruso, vice president of marketing and sales for Jones Brewing Co. in Smithton. Jones Brewing brews a number of brands, including Stoneys, Fort Pitt and Esquire. It produces 90,000 barrels a year, the bulk sold in its core market of Westmoreland, Allegheny, Fayette, Greene and Somerset counties. "Initially there was pressure to do an ice beer, but now they're not doing so well," says Caruso.
<P>
Another area brewing company, Latrobe Brewing Co., has come out with its own ice product - Rock Ice - in certain markets, according to Al Spinelli, vice president of operations, but it is amber in color to further distinguish it from its competitors.
<P>
Despite the big marketing push behind dry and ice beer, neither is gaining a significant foothold in the marketplace. "Dry and ice beers are not big sellers, but you have to put them out there," says Michael Graham, chief operating officer at Pittsburgh Brewing Co., which produces its own ice beer, I.C. Ice, but is most famous for its Iron City and I.C. Light brands. "One thing about this business - if you don't develop anything new, you're going to die."
<P>
Pittsburgh Brewing, the ninth largest in the country at roughly 1.3 million barrels a year, traces its roots to 1861, when Edward Frauenheim and Leopold Vilsack founded Frauenheim and Vilsack Brewery. Eventually a brewery was erected at Liberty Avenue and 34th Street, the present site of Pittsburgh Brewing. The company later changed its name to Iron City Brewing, and, in 1899, Iron City and 20 other local brewing companies merged to become the Pittsburgh Brewing Co. In 1985, the company lost its local ownership when it was acquired and merged with Swan Brewery Co. Ltd. of Perth, Australia. But in 1992, the company returned to local hands when it was purchased by Uniontown native and entrepreneur Michael Carlow.
<P>
Pastorius maintains that ice and dry beer won't do well over the long run because they rely on a gimmick - not a distinctive taste - to attract new drinkers. "This is beer that doesn't offend anyone. Bland, bland, bland. It's all about advertising and marketing, not what's in the can," he believes.
<P>
<font size =+2><B>Finding a Niche</B></font size><BR>
The desire to offer consumers something different is the force behind another trend nationally and locally among both the large and small players: the proliferation of craft-brews. "Consumers like hand-crafted beer. But, Miller and Coors can buy market share by spending oodles and oodles on advertising," says Jones Brewing's Caruso. "But this gets repetitious to the consumer, and it loses its uniqueness." Pittsburgh Brewing's Graham, agrees: "Ten years ago there were a couple of big brewers and a couple of imports. But in the last few years, regional and microbreweries have begun producing craft brands."
<P>
Graham is right. Just over 10 years ago, only 19 craft-breweries were operating in North America. Since then, the industry has had an average growth of 35% for each of the past four years. According to the Institute for Brewing Studies, based in Boulder, Colo., the craft-brewing industry grew by 40% in 1993 with the addition of 30 new microbreweries and 70 new brewpubs across the United States. The total number of operating craft-breweries, including micro-breweries, brewpubs and regional specialty brewers in North America, was more than 460, as of January 1994.
<P>
Craft-brews appeal to consumers who prefer a bolder taste. They achieve this by using 100% barley malt instead of cheaper substitutes of rice and corn, according to Pastorius. Brewing a beer so distinct gives Pastorius a market niche the industry giants can't fill. He says, "We don't compete with the big guys. We make it the old-fashioned way, using pure barley malt. Ninety percent of beer drinkers in this country won't drink our beer. The 10% who drink imports and specialty beers are our market."
<P>
Pastorius finds himself a member of the brewing industry's fastest-growing segment quite by accident. He lived in Germany for 12 years, where beer is perceived differently. "It's not alcoholic - it's nutrients ... it's liquid bread," he explains. After returning to the United States, Pastorius found that he missed the hearty brews of Deutschland and he made a decision: "It got to the point that I said I'm going back to Germany, or I'm doing something here."
<P>
Pastorius and his wife, Mary Beth, who is the manager for Pennsylvania Brewing's restaurant, took their life savings, purchased the former Eberhardt & Ober Brewery buildings, bought brewing equipment and had it shipped to Pittsburgh from Stuttgart, Germany. They also brought over from Germany a brewmaster who was a graduate of the Technical University of Munich at Weidenstephan - the oldest such school in Germany. In the spring of 1989, Pastorius began producing beer at the old E&O Brewery. Until recently, Pastorius referred to this site as the Allegheny Brewery. That, he says, was a mistake. "In July 1994, I realized it was a mistake to give the brewery a different name from its principal product, so I renamed it Pennsylvania Brewing." At this Troy Hill location, Pastorius brews about 10,000 barrels a year, which serves patrons for his restaurant and those at about 100 other locations that offer his products on tap.
<P>
Despite the recent proliferation of craft-brews, they are still a very, very tiny segment of the market. According to statistics from the Association of Brewers, craft-brews held 0.9% of the market in 1993 compared with 0.6% in 1992. Yet, the industry giants don't want to be left behind this trend. In response, some have begun selling brands that appeal to this type of beer drinker. For example, Miller produces Amber Ale and Coors makes Killian's Red.
<P>
"The beverage industry is undergoing the most dramatic change in its history, and microbreweries are leading the charge. It's a trend that is changing consumers' habits forever," says Ray Werner, president of Werner Chepelsky & Partners, which recently added Penn Brewery to its ad agency client roster.
<P>
Other local brewing companies have launched or are planning to launch their own craft-brew lines. Pittsburgh Brewing is among the brewing companies hoping to tap into the lucrative craft-brew niche, according to Graham. Two of those brews are J.J. Wainwright Select lager beer and its spin-off, J.J.'s Evil Eye Ale. Caruso reports that Jones Brewing is investigating the craft-brew niche: "We're looking into doing some handcrafted items. It's now on the drawing board. Ultimately, we'll be doing it in the next year or so, but it's important for us to take our time and do it right the first time."
<P>
Despite the look-alikes from the major companies, Pastorius is certain there is no substitute for true craft-brews. "Our niche is that once you get used to drinking our beer, you can't go back," says Pastorius. "The big guys recognize it and are putting out their entry into our market."
<P>
Pittsburgh may soon be home to another homegrown brewery. Developer Thomas Tripoli and Ron Kosko have preliminary plans to open a brewpub and hotel on the former Mackintosh-Hemphill Foundry property on the South Side. The two hope to begin the first phase of their operations early this year.
<P>

David Fuhrer, president of Frank B. Fuhrer Wholesale Co., is well aware of how effective marketing and image translates into beer sales. Fuhrer Wholesale distributes Budweiser in most of Allegheny County and Coors in a nine-county area. Since its introduction into the local market in 1988, Coors Light has become the biggest seller in Pittsburgh, according to Fuhrer. "There's a mystique about it," he says, explaining in part the brand's huge local success. "Consumers will drink whatever has the right type of image in the marketplace."
<P>
Except for the largest players who have deep pockets for advertising and promotion, most other brewing companies are selective about where they spend their advertising bucks. A big selling point for Pittsburgh Brewing is its point of origin, according to Graham. "Our beer is made here. We're as much a part of Pittsburgh as the Pirates, Steelers and Penguins," he says. Playing this to its advantage, the company uses sales programs that appeal to its audience, such as the I.C. Light Concert Series and commemorative beer cans. Remember those "It's a 'burgh Thing" commercials? Pittsburgh Brewing stresses its Pittsburgh roots in its advertising. "We're not about beaches and babes. When you try to be something you're not, you get into trouble," says Graham.
<P>
Jones Brewing relies on selective promotions. One such successful promotion was tied into the Motor Drome, one of three asphalt racing tracks in Pennsylvania. Jones Brewing came out with a commemorative can and did other tie-ins with the track. "The response was incredible. One hundred and eighty-one distributors participated and we made 181 friends. That's something the giants can't do," says Caruso.
<P>
Until its purchase in 1987 by Labatts USA Inc., a division of John Labatt Ltd., Latrobe Brewing marketed Rolling Rock primarily in the upper northeastern United States. But for the last few years, Rolling Rock has been marketed nationwide. And, for the first time, Latrobe Brewing surpassed the 1 mil-lion barrel mark during its most recent fiscal year. Despite its mass distribution, Spinelli says Rolling Rock has retained a niche. "We don't consider ourselves a mainstream product or a mainstream player. Even though we're sold nationwide, you won't find us in stadiums or places of mass-market consumption," he explains, adding that young professionals are Rolling Rock's primary consumer. "Our beer has a higher price than the Buds, Millers and Coors. We have a unique product."
<P>
Pastorius says Pennsylvania may be a bit less image-conscious than other areas of the country. "Pennsylvania is a big draft state - we sell more draft beer than any other state. You drink draft beer because of the product. But when you buy bottled beer, you're buying an image to set on the bar," 
he says.
<P>
Obviously, Pastorius is unable to compete dollar-for-dollar with the larger breweries to market his products. Instead, he utilizes his restaurant as an advertising vehicle. "Our biggest ad campaign is our restaurant. Great food, fantastic service and great beer," he says. In addition to the draft beer Pennsylvania Brewing produces to supply area bars and restaurants, bottled Penn Pilsner is contract brewed by Jones Brewing for a seven-state market that includes Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware and Virginia. Despite the inroads he's made, Pastorius sometimes gets discouraged. "It's a long, hard process to get to where we are, at capacity. Unfortunately I didn't know what I was getting into," he says. "Too much work, too little reward. The only reason we've gone on is I love beer, and I get some enjoyment bringing this to others."
<HR>
<font size =+2><B>New Suds, Old Method</B></font size><BR>
Penn Brewery recently added two beers to its menu, Penn Dark and Helles Gold, both brewed in the centuries old traditional German method. "Our two new beers [started] coming off a brand new bottling line at the Penn Brewery on Monday, Nov. 21, 1994," says Tom Pastorius, president of Penn Brewery.
<P>
The bottling and labeling line, purchased in Bavaria for $500,000, has a capacity for 8,000 bottles a hour. "Our goal is to bottle all of our specialty beers at our plant," Pastorius adds.
<P>
Between seven and 10 employees will be added to the Penn Brewing Co.'s work force this year. Thirteen authentic German beers are produced there, including Penn Pilsner, which is distributed in seven states in Northeastern United States, Kaiser Pils, Oktoberfest, Christmas Bock, Maerzen, Altbier, Weizen, Weizen Bock, All Star Lager, Maibock and Pastorator.

<B><h2>The Brownfields and the Greenfields</h2></B>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Industrial site reuse legislation may unlock development opportunities that could make Pennsylvania competitive again.</B></FONT SIZE><br><i>By Paul Kengor</i>
<HR>
Environmental issues regularly lead to clashes between activists and business people when the interests of the two do not mesh.
<P>
But there is one area of common ground: the desire to reuse former industrial sites - the plethora of shuttered steel mills and manufacturing plants in western Pennsylvania. In purchasing these brownfields, industry is able to set up shop with much of the necessary infrastructure already in place. The benefit to environmentalists is that industry avoids developing virgin land - also known as greenfields.
<P>
Jack Hubinger is administrative partner of the Pittsburgh office of Jones Day Reavis & Pogue, a law firm with clients who own contaminated industrial real estate. Hubinger says that a typical brownfield is a turn-of-the-century manufacturing site that operated until about 1970. He says most were contaminated not through bad faith or reckless disregard, but merely through normal operating practices.
<P>
According to the Allegheny Conference on Community Develop-ment, nearly two-thirds of the leasable industrial park space in Allegheny County in 1993 consisted of brown-fields, with the proportion higher within certain communities.
<P>
Edward P. Doran is senior vice president of Grubb & Ellis Co., a nationwide real estate company with 98 offices in 61 cities. The company specializes in industrial properties and publishes quarterly real estate market forecasts. Doran brokered the 
$26.5 million sale of the old U.S. Metalsource site (formerly known as U.S. Steel Supply Co.), a steel distribution center next to Kaufmann's warehouse on the North Side.
<P>
The 12-acre site includes a roofed portion of 275,000 square feet, rail access and frontage on the Ohio River. "The consensus in the real estate and development communities was that the maximum that would be obtained for that site was $5 million," Doran remarks. It's been suggested that the site will be used for riverboat gaming and that is what helped elevate the price.
<P>
Among the many local industrial sites currently listed by Grubb & Ellis are two USX properties: 36 acres at Neville Island and a 49-acre site in Dravosburg. The Neville Island site is right off Interstate 79, within 15 minutes of the airport, near rail and water transportation, and a number of major feeder roads.
<P>
Doran maintains that zoning laws will dictate much of what happens to such sites. "It's a lot easier to go from industrial to residential, to get that changed in terms of zoning," he says. "The infrastructure is there. The utilities are already there."

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Shot in the Foot</B></FONT SIZE><br>
In their zeal to ensure cleanup of post-industrial sites, environmen-talists shot themselves in the foot. Sympathetic legislators implemented stringent and costly remediation requirements. As a result of the unquantifiable liabilities under state and federal law, businesses began shunning brownfields.
<P>
Franklin L. Kury, a partner in the Harrisburg office of Reed Smith Shaw & McClay, contends that state Department of Environmental Resources has "unrealistic" stan-dards for cleanup and that its "desire for perfection" works against its goals. "[DER has] got to decide whether they want perfection or action."
<P>
Kury says that a company cannot meet some requirements without spending lots of money. He says that a firm will meet 98% of the requirements before investing a large sum trying to finish the final 2%. "If they want action, they have to get targets that are reachable and keep them steady," says Kury. "You can have very strict standards or something more realistic that you can get some action on. Corporations don't have unlimited money to spend to get there. If the standards are too unrealistic, you'll never get [the reuse] you're looking for."
<P>
Recent major studies by Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz School, Pitt's Center for Social and Urban Research and the Conference on Real Estate of Southwestern Pennsylvania (CRE) emphasize the critical need to maintain and attract business as a means of economic revitalization.
<P>
The CRE study, released in June and conducted by Tripp-Umbach & Associates Inc., concludes: "[I]f the Pittsburgh region is going to compete for manufacturing projects, it has to have legislation ... to indemnify companies against potential legal liability related to their occupancy of brownfield sites. It is no good having marketing programs, incentives, loans, tax abatements and all the other tools of economic development if the region is going to saddle every potential company that uses these sites with multi-million dollar legal environ-mental liabilities. The companies simply will not come when they can receive a more welcome reception in, say, Ohio."
<P>
In many local communities, brownfields are the only available sites. "A lot of the older industrial sites - the Mon Valley for example - have significant unemployment around them and the use of these sites can produce employment for people nearby," says Hubinger. "They often have rail access, natural gas connections, electrical power and with some rehabilitation are ready to be used."
<P>
"The communities in the Mon Valley are hanging on by their fingernails," says Frank Brooks Robinson, president of the Regional Industrial Development Corp. "Banks are not making loans because of liability. The whole thing is kind of stalemated."
<P>
Over $28 million in state and federal funds have been spent at two RIDC sites for new infrastructure and to accelerate demolition and reme-diation. The sites were the former homes of U.S. Steel's Duquesne works and national tube works, in Duquesne and McKeesport, respectively, over 400 acres total. Demolition is about 90% complete and environmental remediation is more than 70% done.
<P>
Despite the progress at City Center of Duquesne and the Industrial Center of McKeesport, RIDC is forced to lease spaces at the sites because companies are unwilling to buy due to liability fears.
<P>
Tim McNulty, who heads the Regional Economic Revitalization Initiative, says, "We've had blinders on in that the net effect of our current environmental laws is to push development into new areas, and that's why we're losing wetlands [and] contributing to the greenhouse effect. Our current environmental policies encourage sprawl. Other states - including Ohio - have acted swiftly in putting laws into place. It enables them to foster development in areas similar to the Mon Valley."
<P>
McNulty believes many laws fail to look at sites on a specific basis. "It's dangerous to generalize sites," he notes. "But it's safe to say that the potential threat of the contamination depends in part on how the site will be used. And I think that many environ-mental policies today haven't taken that into account. The new site may be used for parking and not pose much of a danger to human health."
<P>
How does Pennsylvania stack up compared to competing states? "I wouldn't say we're behind the curve," says Hubinger. "There were actually bills introduced in the prior Legislature three or four years ago. At that point, Pennsylvania was probably right on or ahead of the curve." He notes, however, that while other states have closed their legislation recently, Pennsylvania has not.
<P>
"Given our business and technology base in the environmental industry," McNulty notes, "it could be a job growth, as well as site development, strategy." Indeed, not only would better reuse of brownfields promote job growth at the sites themselves, but it could also serve to bolster employment in the region's environmental technology sector. The region has the third largest concentration of such companies in the country.
<P>
In a typical scenario, says Hubinger, a company has a facility that no longer fits into its long-term plans. The company wants to sell it, but often can't find a buyer. In some cases, the company doesn't even try to sell the site, Hubinger says. "Therefore you have a reservoir of sites that aren't even being put on the market."
<P>
Ronald Gdovic, a local environ-mental development consultant, is heading up a project with CMU professor Paul Fischbeck. The project, informally dubbed "Industrial Site Reuse Project of Southwestern Pennsylvania," is sponsored by the Heinz Foundation and involves people from Pitt and CMU. Among the chief goals is stimulating economic growth by promoting industrial site reuse.
<P>
Gdovic says that there is currently no comprehensive list of industrial properties in southwestern Pennsyl-vania. "That's a problem because if people from outside the region [want to] acquire an industrial site there is no central database or clearinghouse of information," he maintains. "Nor is there an umbrella organization that could direct people to contacts in the area."
<P>
Gdovic's project goes beyond being just a marketing tool. It incor-porates the demographics of the sites. "The really ground-breaking thing about this project is that we're proposing to offer it on the Internet," he says.
<P>
It will work like this: Suppose a German firm wants to put some manufacturing facilities in the United States. The company can log on the Internet, enter certain key words or site requirements - such as rail access, minimum square footage and labor force - and identify potential properties in the Pittsburgh region. "There's nothing like this anywhere in the world - not at this level on the Internet," says Gdovic.
<P>
In all likelihood, industry would prefer brownfield sites, assuming standards were relaxed. The reason is not necessarily some altruistic con-cern for pine trees and groundhogs. In a simple cost-benefit analysis, developing a rural site can mean paying out for new roads and utilities.
<P>
Purchasers of brownfields must accept liability for past contamination. Developers can spend more than $1 million just conducting environ-mental assessments. Often a company meets the necessary requirements only to be told that the standards have been raised. The business is then forced to spend money on further remediation that could have been reinvested to expand operations and create jobs.
<P>
According to the Southwestern Pennsylvania Growth Alliance (a nine-county partnership for economic development), DER standards order owners to restore brownfields to pristine "background" conditions, defined as "prior to human habit-ation." If a site is unable to achieve pristine standards using today's technology, DER reserves the right to require added cleanup when new technology becomes available. Such uncertainty makes it extremely difficult for a developer to assess the desirability of reusing a site.
<P>
Fortunately, Harrisburg is getting the message. A variety of legislation has been introduced to promote the reuse of industrial sites.
<P>
House Bill 1895, which passed the House in 1994, modifies cleanup standards for abandoned industrial sites. House Bills 952 and 2565 offer liability protection for financial institutions and economic develop-ment agencies. The recently intro-duced H.B. 2700 authorizes limited risk-based remediation standards in cases where a cleanup to meet back-ground conditions has been proven to be infeasible and unaffordable. Senate Bills 650 and 972 allow businesses a choice among three alternative standards in developing cleanup plans. The bills also provide for liability protection for buyers, owners, economic development agencies and financial institutions.
<P>
Reed Smith's Kury cites S.B. 972 and H.B. 2700 as the ones of primary interest. The original 972 passed the Senate, then went to the House, where it was gutted. In the House, 972 was largely replaced by 2700, which is the legislation favored by the DER and Gov. Robert Casey (who leaves office this month). If the House passes the amended version of 972, the bill then goes to the Senate for approval. The Senate will most likely favor the original 972. The two chambers will probably have to reach some sort of compromise between 972 and 2700 - ditto for industry and environmentalists.
<P>
Industry seems to favor the original S.B. 972, opposing H.B. 2700 and the amended version of 972 that incorporates 2700. "The House version [of amended 972] is not acceptable to RIDC," states Robinson. "The position that RIDC has taken - similar to the Mon Valley Commission and the Southwestern Pennsylvania Growth Alliance - is that we support the original S.B. 972 and also the House Bill 3060 because these bills come up with reasonable risk-based standards and there's finality to the remediation costs, so industry knows what it has to do." At the same time, he says, the bills ensure that industry cannot act in a manner detrimental to health or safety. "Critics will argue that industry is going to use this [legislation] as a means to be careless again," Robinson comments. "But other laws in the commonwealth prevent that from happening again."
<P>
The Pennsylvania Environmental Council seems supportive of most industrial site reuse legislation. It is, however, against S.B. 972. "The council believes that no bill is preferable to [the original] S.B. 972," says Hill. Hill is careful to note that there are provisions that the group supports. "We are unusual in that we are one of a few environmental groups supporting much of this piece of legislation. We are against some provisions of the original 972, but not all of them."
<P>
Hill's group has not taken a position on the amended version of 972. "Our concern with 972 as it existed - and this applies to H.B. 3060 also - is this: We are all for the reuse of industrial sites along the riverfronts in Pittsburgh and throughout the state. The problem with the legislation is ... it doesn't just apply to former industrial sites. [It lowers] cleanup standards throughout the commonwealth at greenfield sites as well as brownfield sites. We're opposed to that, vehemently opposed."
<P>
He concludes: "We are an environmental group that strongly believes in legislation, but we don't want it to be used as a vehicle for environmental degradation through-out Pennsylvania." Kury, who is a board member of the council, seems to agree. The original 972, says Kury, would be "great if you limit it to sites with a previous industrial history."
<P>
McNulty cautions that legislation to promote industrial site reuse is not a cure-all. "You still must stimulate the economic engines to bring business to those sites. The danger is to think that legislation will solve the problem. It is critical. But the law itself will only create the potential for change. How we benefit from the laws depends on how the various commu-nities - in real estate, economic development, government, academia - work in marketing these sites. The laws are only the first step."

<B><h2>Making the Most of Mutual Funds</h2></B>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Banks are blasting into an area where the growth has been explosive.</B></FONT SIZE><br><i>By Lydia Strohl</i>
<HR>
Tired of seeing customers withdraw money from their vaults to invest in higher risk, higher yield vehicles, banks have jumped on the mutual fund bandwagon. Their aim? To become a pecuniary Wal-Mart, providing the entire spec-trum of financial services to customers and in the process add an income stream to their own bottom line.
<P>
"We were missing the boat by not marketing mutual funds to branch-based customers," says Don Jacobson, first vice president and manager of retail investment services at Mellon Bank. "We saw there was a large and growing segment of what we call searchers,' not happy with their portfolio, but they didn't really know what they should invest in. Mutual funds are a good vehicle for the mass market - they are diversified, with professional fund managers, and people can get in for a relatively small amount."
<P>
Trend? More like a ground swell. From the first to the second quarter of 1994, the number of banks selling mutual funds and annuities increased from 2,378 banks to 2,569 banks, according to Veribanc Inc., a banking research firm in Wakefield, Mass. Fifty-three Pennsylvania banks sell mutual funds and annuities; 23  in west-ern Pennsylvania sell mutual funds.
<P>
The extreme drop in short-term interest rates at the beginning of the 1990s is one of the factors fueling this skyrocketing growth. Concurrently, banks dropped their rates, making interest-bearing deposits less attrac-tive. Seeing 40% of mutual fund growth coming from bank deposits, bank officials knew this was one game they couldn't afford not to play.
<P>
"If we can serve the customer's needs, they will not go elsewhere," says Jacobson. "If our customer goes to Merrill Lynch for mutual funds, they could sell him a home equity loan. And we want them to buy that here."
<P>
That's the indirect benefit. The direct benefit is income. That amount varies, depending on how the bank approaches the mutual fund market. Some banks, eager to make mutual funds available to their customers, will broker third-party funds. In this scenario, the bank gets a percentage of the sales and service fees and commissions, and also keeps the customer. Or, a bank might chose to set up its own mutual funds, in which case it would get not only the sales and servicing fees, but also profit from the investment, management and administration of the funds. But there are complex issues involved with both of these avenues.
<P>
<FONT SIZE =+2><B>Two Issues</B></FONT SIZE><BR>
"There are two issues that a bank truly has to come to grips with," says James F. Getz, president of the broker-dealer division of Federated Securities Corp. "One is distribution - they have nothing if they don't have the market for it. If a bank is thinking of manufacturing and distributing their own fund, there is a critical mass of assets that they have to have to make it efficient for themselves and the client. If it isn't realistic to achieve $5 billion in assets in a relatively short time frame, then they should look at third-party funds."
<P>
Banks have an advantage in the mutual fund arena because they have a developed customer base. The March issue of The Bankers Magazine reports a Fidelity Investments survey in which 32% of investors already owning funds replied that they were "very likely" to purchase funds from their own banks. Only 8% of investors are likely to develop new bank relationships.
<P>
There are very real risks for banks selling mutual funds. Traditional bank deposit vehicles are guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.; mutual funds are not. It is the bank's responsibility to make sure that the customer is notified of the uninsured nature of mutual funds, and the potential loss of principal. Failure to follow guidelines recently set by the office of the Comptroller of the Currency on this issue can open the bank to lawsuits from dissatisfied customers, as well as regulatory action.
<P>
Last May, The First National Bank of Herminie in Irwin began selling mutual funds. James R. Lauffer, chairman and CEO of the bank, is also chairman of the board of the Independent Bankers Association of America. His bank is one of the first to offer mutual funds through IBA Financial Services, a division set up for community banks to sell mutual funds. The IBA service is contracted with the Massachusetts Financial Services family.
<P>
"Because the customer can come in here and grab me by the tie, we have to be careful of what we sell," says Lauffer. "We have to do more due diligence to make sure that the customer knows that mutual funds can go down in price. And we have to go overboard to make them understand that these funds are not insured, and they have to be in them for the long run."
<P>
Lauffer says that the bank was going to contract with a third-party provider to come in and manage the whole mutual fund program from soup to nuts, but that didn't give enough control; other community banks have had bad experiences with this strategy.
<P>
Instead, First National hired a broker from Wall Street, with series 6 and 7 license. The desks from which mutual funds are sold are clearly marked, and segregated. IBA Financial Services provides a qualifying software program that the broker goes through with a potential customer to assess objectives, risk tolerance and other investment criteria. With the aid of the software, the broker gives investment advice that spans seven of Mass Financial's funds. Though the broker can sell any Mass Financial fund, only seven of them are in the mix, because Lauffer feels that the consultants must know each of them inside out.
<P>
"The broker is salaried, so that he is getting no incentive on the commis-sion from the sale. The objective is to put the customer in the right situation," says Lauffer. "He has told people he doesn't think mutual funds are the right investment for them."
<P>
Though he states that getting into mutual funds was a defensive tactic, Lauffer is committed to developing the service. He believes that there is a conflict of interest when banks sell their own funds.
<P>
"There is more incentive to sell your own fund - it only makes sense that way," says Lauffer. "Then they make the management fee and the commission."
<P>
<FONT SIZE =+2><B>Selling Proprietary Funds</B></FONT SIZE><BR>
The banks in the Pittsburgh region that sell their own funds, which include Mellon Bank, Integra Bank and PNC, are well aware of this criticism. They go out of their way to point out the structural elements of their programs that discourage this from happening.
<P>
Though Mellon Bank has offered mutual funds in the trust manage-ment mix for years, the bank has only just entered the retail mutual fund business. Two years ago Mellon introduced personal investment consulting, which also uses software to assess customer needs. The personal investment consultants (PICs) are employed by InvestNet, a brokerage subsidiary of Mellon Bank. PICs sell stocks, bonds and annuities (through Talbot Insurance Agency), as well as a range of 35 mutual funds which include the Laurel Funds, Mellon's proprietary funds. After the bank merged with New York-based Dreyfus Corp. last summer, the Laurel name changed to Dreyfus.
<P>
Dreyfus, a well-recognized name in mutual funds, gives Mellon an even bigger entree into the market. This November, Mellon had $76 billion in mutual fund assets under manage-ment. Fully $69 billion of those assets were in proprietary funds, including the Dreyfus assets. The remaining $7 billion are managed in other funds, among them Federated and Fidelity.
<P>
"Offering the better funds from each family offers objectivity," says Jacobson. "There are banks that sell only their own funds, but we couldn't cover as wide a range of investment goals."
<P>
Jacobson says that the program experienced tremendous growth at the onset, which has slowed. He estimates that there are about 20,000 customers in the program; 20% of which are new to Mellon Bank. About half a dozen funds have been dropped and added in the ongoing review of recommended funds; Jacobson says customers' investments are discussed with them once a year.
<P>
"If they are only investing money for a year or two mutual funds don't make sense," says Jacobson. "We don't want to cause them to pull their money out and incur another sales charge. It is illegal, too, to cause account churning. We recommend that they stay in a fund; they all fluctuate and the customer is much better off if the underlying dynamics of the fund are sound. They should be willing to ride it out."
<P>
Mellon is by no means the only local institution jumping headlong into the mutual fund fray. In January 1993, PNC Bank launched the PNC Family of Funds, which now includes 24 funds with $5 billion in assets. PNC also acts as manager for funds with assets approaching $30 billion. The bank provides custody, accounting and transfer services for other mutual funds and, in October, introduced MutualPartners asset allocation service, a PC-based system that allows community banks to give customers investment advice. That service is similar to one called Capital Directions, which is available to PNC customers.
<P>
"The merger of PNB and Provident National Bank brought together a large institutional trust division in Philadelphia," says George Bernard, senior vice president of mutual funds with PNC Securities Corp. "We had the discipline and expertise develop over time, so it was a natural progression."
  <P>
PNC Bank offers its customers personal investment counseling through PNC Brokerage Corp., which has brokers throughout the PNC branch network. The brokers sell PNC and other mutual funds, like Putnam and Alliance. Bernard says that the PNC Family of Funds accounts for about 20% to 30% of these sales. Depending on customer needs, the broker can refer to ProVest, a subsid-iary selling insurance products, to PNC Securities Corp. for stocks and bonds, or to the investment manage-ment and trust department. The bank assures that their counselors are giving sound, objective advice by using mystery shoppers and by compen-sating counselors by salary and long-term bonus.
<P>
"Just jamming product is a long-term formula for disaster," says Bernard. "Educating the customer is paramount. No one family of funds can meet all needs."
<P>
<FONT SIZE =+2><B>Similar Philosophies</B></FONT SIZE><BR>
This philosophy is shared by Steve Hartle, president and chief operating officer of Integra Trust Co., which unrolled a similar program through Personal Investment Services Inc., owned by the Richard Leahy Co., deploying 45 securities licensed counselors throughout Integra's 260 branches to sell third-party mutual funds and annuities.
<P>
"This structure reinforces that, legally, these are not employees of Integra Financial," says Hartle. "There need to be contracts and agreements that maintain the appropriate arm's length relationship, not giving the impression that we are compensating people directly."
<P>
Hartle also stresses determining customer needs, and says the compensation system, which is salary plus a commission that is based on production but is product neutral, is designed to uphold that.
<P>
"We don't want to put the philosophy of needs-based selling at risk," says Hartle. "The focus is determining what our customer needs and providing products that meet that need. We're not product jockeys, trying to sell the product of the month. If the customer feels he is well-served that bodes well for a long-term relationship."
<P>
Last year, the first year of the program, which Integra rolled out in stages throughout the region, mutual fund sales reached a volume of $40 million, and represented 65% of the total volume generated by Personal Investment Services. In the first nine months of 1994, mutual fund sales reached $30 million, and Hartle extrapolates that to another $40 million year. But this year, mutual fund sales are only 43% of the total volume.
<P>
"The environment and the market are much different - markets have been hammered this year," says Hartle. In this scenario, annuities have 
performed far better. "Annuity rates are set annually, a reflection of the interest rate environment. Last year, interest rates were low and annuity rates low. This year, that's reversed."
<P>
That trend is reflected nationwide; for although more banks have entered the mutual fund market, sales volume dropped from $111 billion to $105 billion from the first to the second quart-er of this year.
<P>
"Bond mutual funds have seen the fastest declines," says Mellon's Jacobson. "As interest rates increase and bond prices decrease, people who have invested in bond market funds move their dollars. Volatile markets can slow sales - but that is cyclical and not unexpected. Money market funds and annuities do better and so we see a shifting of purchase behavior and that's appropriate."
<P>
These are general rules of economics, and of investing, and these players are not likely to be driven from the market. They seem to see their task as one of educating consumers on the nature of this game, signing up only those who can afford to play for the long haul.
<P>
"We've seen some redemption, but it is by no means massive," says Federated's Getz. "The personality of the consumer is different today - they are more sophisticated. We have what was essentially a crash in the bond market, but there have not been mass redemp-tions. People have the right attitude towards investing - it's over time."
What will affect the mutual fund market, Getz believes, is the influx of players.
<P>
"Look at the dynamics. There has been a lot of money invested in mutual fund product participation over the past 48 months and a lot of banks entering the market. Thirty percent of all households are into mutual funds, and with 401(k)s that will grow," he says. "There will be a move to the macro, a consolidation. Some players with fund complexes in the couple of hundred million dollars are wondering how long they can stay in. But Sears launched the Discover card into what was thought to be a saturated market. And when Thomas Monaghan formed Domino's Pizza, who would have thought we needed another pizza delivery service? There will still be parties entering the mutual fund industry, but the focus will be macro."
<P>
Stay tuned. It seems we have some players in the Pittsburgh region.

<FONT SIZE=+3><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="../pictures/publisher.gif"> </FONT SIZE><FONT SIZE=+2>This Work is Taxing </FONT SIZE><i> By Linda Dickerson</i><P>
Exorbitantly high business taxes and the prevailing view of southwestern Pennsylvania's horrendous labor climate are frequently cited as the two most significant deterrents to locating or growing a company here. To grow and prosper, we must eliminate the region's barriers to entry by creating a welcoming environment attractive to start-up companies, existing growth enter-prises and other firms on the move.
<P>
Pennsylvania distinguishes itself in many ways. Unfortunately, one of the ways that we stand apart from the crowd is by having one of the highest business taxes in the country. I purport that another mark of distinction would be a better trademark.
<P>
Economic development in the region will stagnate without an appropriate tax structure. Although the Pennsylvania Legislature provided some relief by lowering our corporate net income tax to 10.99% this year, we still remain grossly uncompetitive.
<P>
Recognizing that governments require money (usually in significant amounts) to operate and serve their constituents, taxes are the framework around which communities build their future. At the height of frustration, an entrepreneurial friend of mine retorted that if he just didn't have to manage a sales force, his company would prosper. While sales forces frequently rank among the most difficult to manage, they nonetheless generate a company's income. Without sales, most, if not all, enterprises fail. Without taxes, most, if not all, governments and the communities they serve would collapse.
<P>
The Regional Economic Revitalization Initiative's recommendation that the region create a Tax Review Council is a brilliant suggestion. Designed to be an independent, bipartisan effort to successfully revise the commonwealth's tax structure, the council will engage the nation's best thinking, and analyze alternative tax structures. Following on the heels of countless unsuccessful local and statewide tax reform efforts, the proposed Pennsylvania Tax Review Council distinguishes itself by the depth and clarity of its assignment.
<P>
The council will focus exclusively on developing the optimal tax structure to recommend to the state Legislature. Quite simply, its assignment is to suggest revisions to the commonwealth's tax structure that as part of an integrated effort will restore economic vitality to this region. This is a noble goal worthy of the magnitude of resources requisite to assure the council's success. With the nation's best and brightest at work and a region committed to the council's vitality, the council will craft a blueprint to achieve economic growth through progressive tax policy. We can no longer afford to stand in the way of such progress.

<font size =+2><B>Strike Back</B></font size><BR>
I was interested to read Lydia Strohl's article, "Strike Down" [September 1994]. I was pleased that you focused on school strikes in the companion article, "Round and Round."
<P>
Twenty teachers' strikes this year are more than enough to establish a problem. A number of Pennsylvanians believe that teacher strikes are a serious problem which the State Legislature must solve. Most see this tragic parade as directly related to rising education costs and falling results.
<P>
This is not a problem without an answer. We can ... ensure uninterrupted education for children, fair compensation for teachers and relief from runaway property taxes for taxpayers.
<P>
What do other states do? Forty do not permit teachers to strike. If strikes occur, penalties are assessed such as lost wages, forfeiture of tenure or termination.
<P>
New York is considered a labor-oriented state, but teacher strikes have been banned since 1967. Teachers who strike lose two days' pay for each day of strike. Nevertheless, New York teachers rank third in the nation in average salary. Teachers need not fear financial purgatory if strikes are banned. Most of the 10 states with the highest average teachers' salaries prohibit strikes.
<P>
Pennsylvania teachers' average salaries rank sixth, and comparisons show [they] are well compensated in salary, benefits and job security, no matter what yardstick is applied.
<P>
If we repeal the right to strike, should we replace it with binding arbitration?
<P>
At first glance, binding arbitration does seem a neat way to end unsuccessful negotiations. But a wealth of tragic experiences clearly demonstrate the fallacy and cost of this flawed theory.
<P>
Of the top 20 states in average teachers' salaries, only four provide for binding arbitration. In Connecticut, this process has been so shocking that Gov. Weicker is leading the effort to repeal it. Rhode Island has restricted [it] to apply only to non-salary issues. North Dakota passed binding arbitration in 1991, but it was repealed a year later by citizens referendum.
<P>
In 1967 ... the Pennsylvania Legislature granted police and firefighters binding arbitration because of public safety and welfare [issues]. Yet, three years later, the Legislature refused to grant binding arbitration to teachers and other public employees and, instead, permitted them to strike.
<P>
In the private sector, binding arbitration is rarely considered for any substantive issue, let alone pay and benefits. Yet private strikes are declining as both parties recognize the need to solve their problems.
<P>
The process normally leads to splitting the differences or accepting the position of one of the parties. Neither serve the needs of [both]. It is wrong and presumptuous for the Pennsylvania Legislature to force communities to abdicate their responsibilities for bargaining with their teachers and for setting local school tax rates.
<P>
Pennsylvania teachers can strike with almost none of the financial loss experienced by all others who strike. Teachers ... are guaranteed a full years salary when days are made up in June. It's this unique certainty of pay that serves as a significant disincentive to settlement.
<P>
Another disincentive is retroactivity, which calls for the pay and benefit increases of the new contract to apply for all days worked since the old contract expired. Our laws should promote settlement for the good of all, particularly the students. For this reason, retroactive increases should be prohibited.
How can we solve this problem? The answer is to repeal the right of teachers to strike or to require pay to be lost and not made up.
<P>
Solving the teachers' strike problem in Pennsylvania is not only possible, but imperative. The task ... will require a considerable effort to ensure that the Legislature understands the problem, the unique aspects of teacher bargaining and strikes, and the solutions. It will require courage for the Legislature to do what is necessary.<P>

<!IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="GuestEditor.gif"> <FONT SIZE=+2><B>Eliminating Pennsylvania S Corporations: The Simple Way to Export More Jobs to Other States</B></FONT SIZE><br><i>By Grant M. Wirth</i><P>
<HR>
It's hard not to ignore politicians when they call for higher taxes on S corporations in Pennsyl-vania. Because dozens of other states give some form of preferential tax treatment to S corporations, higher taxes would likely retard the growth of inbound investment, and most certainly add to the cost of the goods and services produced within the commonwealth.
<P>
Recent statements by several politicians that a need exists for more taxes on Pennsylvania S corporations, solely because they dont generate as much tax revenue as other corporations, are a not-so-clever way of attempting to divide and conquer corporate taxpayers so they can be squeezed for more tax. As I read it, the strategy is to pit the small companies against the big ones, and then try to get a few of the big guys to say that the corporate tax burden isn't being borne fairly. State legislators will then have all the ammunition they need to increase taxes on the S corporations, the justification being provided by finger pointing from within the business community.
<P>
The only fly in the ointment is that, so far, I haven't heard anybody agree with the politicians who have said that there's inequity with the status quo. What I hear is that business is pretty much united in their belief that the corporate tax reductions that occurred in 1994 are a sorry and miserable excuse for real action on the part of the legislative and executive branches to clean up the financial mess we have in Pennsylvania. The real problem is not that we don't have enough tax revenue to balance the state budget, it's that we don't have enough responsible people in Harrisburg who are watching how our tax dollars are currently being spent.
<P>
S corporations are generally small businesses that could just as easily operate as proprietorships or partnerships, both of which pay no tax. Instead, the income is taxed in the personal tax return of the owners. Back in 1958 when the U.S. Congress first invented S corporations, the thought process was that small businesses would prosper if their owners could have the benefit of limited liability for corporate debts and yet retain the simplicity of one tier of tax on profits. True, there are exceptions to the generality that S corporations are small businesses. But there are exceptions to every rule, and to change Pennsylvania S corporation tax policy based on the exception to the rule is just plain wrong.
<P>
I cant remember the last time that I spoke to someone who believed that there was something less than excessive waste and inefficiency in state government. I also can't find anybody who thinks that state government needs more money, or that our tax dollars are currently spent wisely. How can politicians, in good conscience, call for more taxes on the very companies that are driving the state's economy with job creation?
<P>
Recent reports that small businesses aren't generating their share of jobs anymore aren't substantiated by anything that I've recently seen published by the Small Business Administration. In fact, very small businesses are creating jobs like wildfire. What sense does it make to nurture small companies through a myriad of state-funded programs only to tax the profits heavily and then waste the tax collected?
<P>
I think that big business in Pennsylvania has a legitimate gripe about corporate tax rates in this state. But the fight is not with small business, it's with the state Legislature. The mission of the legislative branch of state government should be to reduce both corporate and individual taxes through governmental downsizing. When I use the word tax, I also mean unnecessary governmental regulation of the behavior of both individuals and businesses. The cost of compliance with excessive regulation is no different than paying a tax, and it doesn't take much thought to understand that the compliance burden of unnecessary regulation of business is felt most heavily by smaller companies.
<P>
Regardless of whether it's large or small corporations paying excessive taxes to the state, or compliance with unnecessary rules, the citizens of Pennsylvania ultimately bear the economic brunt of irresponsible state spending and excessive business regulation. Everything costs more to produce, and, therefore, our goods and services are less cost competitive than those produced elsewhere.
<P>
To get state spending back to where it should be, I favor long-term spending and hiring freezes, privatization of government and anything that forces state government to find ways to become more effective and efficient in the delivery of services. In essence, what I advocate is that both individual and corporate taxpayers unite in their demand for government that is run in a businesslike manner. We must expect more in the way of results, and hold accountable those who don't deliver what is expected. We must force our system to work better. There's really no other option.
<P>
Corporate taxpayers who aren't S corporations have a legitimate concern about corporate income tax rates, but their situation won't improve by taking it out of the hide of small business. I'd like to see tax cuts for both business and individuals that are funded by slicing the fat out of the state budget. I can't believe that state government couldn't function on many hundreds of millions of dollars less in revenue.
<P>
If there's a playing field that's not level in Pennsylvania, it's not the corporate tax field, it's the place where our Legislature spends the taxes that we all work so hard to pay. It's going to be an uphill battle all the way to get state spending back to where it should be. The question is whether business in Pennsylvania is up to the fight.

<TITLE>Executive Report January 1994 Issue: ER Index</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<a href="http://www.pittsburgh.net/cgi-bin/imagemap/ERBanner">
<IMG BORDER=0 ALIGN=bottom SRC="../pictures/Departments.ER.gif" ISMAP></a><BR>
<I>ER Index is compiled by Doug Thomas, vice president and director of research at the HomeState Pennsylvania Growth Fund in Lancaster.</I>
<HR>
Continued strength in local technology and healthcare stocks could not offset weakness in bank, basic materials and capital goods stocks, as the Executive Report Index declined 1.89% for the month ended Nov. 11, 1994. That com-pares with a 1.44% decline in the S&P 500 Index. Since inception, the 
25-component share-weighted ER Index is up 4.71% vs. 0.24% for the S&P.
<P>
Rising interest rates are never good for bank stocks, and now is no exception. Mellon, Integra and Parkvale have performed poorly, mainly due to investor concerns that spreads will shrink and earnings will follow. PNC, which is not in our index, announced that it expects net interest income to decline by as much as 15% this year. PNC has seen its stock fall from 31 5/8 in early June to 20 5/8.
<P>
Banks are struggling to offset this by increasing noninterest income from nontraditional products, like mutual funds and other asset management services.
<P>
Integra became the latest local bank to announce its own mutual funds, called the Investor Funds. Integra's move followed substantial restructuring that chairman and CEO William Roemer hopes will refocus the bank on improved customer service. The move was not designed as a cost-cutting exercise, Roemer says. Rather, after a series of acquisitions and mergers to consolidate, Roemer says Integra began to lose touch with its customers, and he wants to stem the tide. Integra's stock has fallen from 49 1/2 in June to 39 3/8. Meanwhile, in an attempt to bolster their share prices, many banks -- including Integra and Parkvale -- have undertaken share buy-backs.
<P>
The index wasn't helped by American Eagle Outfitters, which fell 18.58%, to 23, on weaker-than-expected October sales, which the company attrib-uted to a delayed holiday shopping season because of unseasonably warm weather. However, fiscal first quarter sales rose 49% and same store sales increased 5.7%. The company continues to open stores at a rapid clip, with 45 since August and 40 more planned by July.
<P>
Also weighing on the index was USX - U.S. Steel Group, which declined 10%, and Alcoa, which fell nearly 7%. In addition to worry over interest rates, investors clearly are concerned about where we are in the business cycle. If, as many fear, the U.S. economy is at its peak, then how much growth is there left for the steels, aluminums and other basic industries? We fear a self-fulfilling prophecy.
<P>
Our technology stocks continue to perform superbly, with Black Box, Cable Design, Fore Systems and Legent all averaging a 14% price increase. All report significant earnings and revenue momentum.
<P>
General Nutrition was also strong, up nearly 20%, following fiscal third quarter earnings that rose 59%, beating expectations. GNC, which intends to dominate the vitamin and nutrition supplement market, plans to open 300 to 350 stores annually for the next four or five years.
<P>
Northstar Health Services rose 13%, following a 210% increase in its third quarter net income and a 166% increase in revenues. The outstanding performance was due to growth in outpatient operations and several acquisitions, which have expanded the company's capabilities while leveraging fixed costs.
<P>
Respironics reported better-than-expected results for its most recent quarter, and its stock rose 13.6%. Net income rose 12% to 28 cents per share, from 25 cents last year.
<P>
Heinz agreed to purchase the All-American Gourmet Co., maker of Budget Gourmet frozen foods, from Phillip Morris' Kraft General Foods. The popular brand has annual sales of about $300 million. Heinz shares rose over 4%.
<P>
Kennametal, which had terrific fiscal first quarter results, followed that up by announcing a joint venture with W.W. Grainger Inc., one of the nation's leading distributors of industrial supplies. The two companies will market maintenance, repair and operations supplies and metal-cutting tools. The deal should yield positive results for both companies soon.
<P>
Johnstown America has a new contract with the United Steelworkers, but that did little to boost the company's stock price. The other related company in the index, MK Rail, also continues to struggle, mainly due to uncertainty about a sizable money-losing contract for Southern Pacific, and questions about the prospects for continued economic growth. The railroad industry is booming, with no letup in sight, and apparently, that worries some folks.
<P>
Shares of Industrial Scientific Corp., the maker of portable gas detection devices, have been walloped recently. The company, which is not in our index, reported sharply lower than expected earnings for its fiscal third quarter. Its shares tumbled to a 52-week low of 17 3/4, from a high of 31 1/2 last January. Revenues for the quarter declined 15%. Earnings per share were 25 cents. One of the company's analysts had forecast 45 cents.

: Harry Guidotti</B></FONT SIZE><br><i>By Kristin Giron</i><P>
<HR>
<B>Occupation:</B>	CEO of Selemoh Cookie Co.<BR>
<B>Age:</B>		50<BR>
<B>Family Life:</B>	Guidotti and his wife, Vivian, live in Library. They have three 			children: Erik, 29, Ross, 27, and Sarah, 18.<BR>
<B>Hometown:</B>	Pittsburgh<BR>
<B>Education:</B>	South Hills High School<BR>
<B>Hobbies:</B>		Magic, astronomy, billiards and classical guitar<BR>
<B>Last Vacation & Where:</B>	Mr. and Mrs. Olympia contest in Atlanta<BR>
<B>Favorite Book or Quote:</B>	"A few facts are revealing, too many are obscuring."<BR>
<B>The News:</B><BR>
Guidotti has been making his mark in the sales world since high school when he peddled Bibles door to door. He went on to become chairman of the Guidotti Marketing Group, a $30 million sales promotion company that is 40% employee owned. Now he has invested more than $150,000 in a nonprofit cookie company, hoping his business acumen will help less fortunate folks.
<P>
Guidotti started Selemoh to raise money through retail outlets and fund-raisers for homeless families. "I came out of a restaurant in New York years ago and I noticed large boxes piled up near a heating vent," he explains. "I walked past and noticed a set of bare feet that belonged to a small child sticking out of the box. I was devastated and vowed I would do something about it."
<P>
Guidotti retired as chairman of Guidotti Marketing so he could work full-time at Selemoh (homeless spelled backward minus one s). Nine employees work at the South Hills bakery, which opened in September. Later this year, Guidotti plans on going national.
<P>
"We're helping people get back on their feet and my hope is simply that, to help people out," he says. "The money we raise will stay in the community that raised it."
<P>
Despite his focus on Selemoh, Guidotti has also recently opened JC Flippen's Eatery, a diner in Pleasant Hills.
<P>
Guidotti's outlook on his success is simple: time and effort. But throughout his career, he has never sacrificed the beliefs and ideas of his employees.
<P>
"I've invested so much into my companies, but I would never compromise my people for my business," says Guidotti. "That's a sacred trust I won't break."

Top 10 Growth Companies </h2></B><br><FONT SIZE=+1><b>Banks dominate the fifth annual compilation of area performers.</FONT SIZE></b><br>
<i>By Richard Bierck</i>
<P>
After a rough stretch of economic road in the early 1990s, banks across the country are enjoying a resurgence in earnings, and banking companies in western Pennsylvania are no exception. <p>
With lending business hoisted by interest rates that plummeted in 1992 and 1993, bank earnings nationwide this year have skyrocketed. <p>
But while hundreds of banks across the country careened to failure two years ago, the stronger of their ilk in this region continued to gain in earnings.
Their momentum proved propitious. <p>
Amid this year's national scenario of banking strength, six bank holding companies place among the 10 fastest growing public companies in western Pennsylvania for 1994. Executive Report's annual survey, conducted by Parker/Hunter Inc. of Pittsburgh, is based largely on compounded earnings per share over the past five years. It includes earnings projections for 1994. <p>
John Frankola, Parker/Hunter senior vice president, says that three factors have spurred bank earnings: declining interest rates; improved credit quality in the lending market, decreasing the amounts banks put aside for losses on loans and greater operational efficiencies. <p>
Although analysts aren't predicting an austere rerun of the national banking scene in the early 1990s, Frankola believes that the same economic cycle that accelerated banks' earnings in 1994 may slow them a bit next year. <p>
"I would be surprised if there are as many banks on the Top 10 list in 1995," Frankola says, adding that manufacturing concerns will probably knock some of the banking companies off the list next year. <p>
In 1992 and again in 1993, there was only one banking institution in the Top 10: First Western Bancorp Inc. This year, First Western is joined by PNC Bank Corp., Parkvale Savings Bank, Fidelity Bancorp Inc., S&T Bancorp Inc. and USBancorp Inc. <p>
Nevertheless, high technology and medical manu-facturing concerns lead the list this year, as they did last. <p>
Industrial Scientific Corp., which placed second in 1993, moved to No. 1 this year, with a compounded annual growth rate of 35% since 1989. <p>
Appearing on the Top 10 list for the third consecutive year in 1994 is Medrad Inc.; for the fourth consecutive year, Mylan Laboratories Inc., and the fifth consecutive year, Respironics Inc. <p>

<font size =+2>PNC Bank Corp.: </font size> 
Far and away, the strongest earnings per-formance in banking earnings this year was that of PNC, one of the nation's largest banking companies. <p>
PNC has a compounded annual growth rate of 29.8%, including projected year-end earnings of $3.31 per share.<p>
For the quarter that ended June 30, PNC posted returns of 1.26% on average assets and 17.7% on average shareholders' equity.<p>
Walter E. Gregg Jr., executive vice president of finance and administration, attributes this showing to a variety of factors. One of the most systemic took root in early 1990.<p>
"That's when we moved the organization as a bank to a line-of-business management structure. We started in January 1990 to handle this company as a single business long before it was fashionable. It's more efficient this way," he says.<p>
PNC began running four basic lines of business -- retail banking, corporate banking, investment banking, and investment management and trust -- centrally by using a $200 million infrastructure that includes the new data processing center on Parkway West. <p>
"This way, we have the ability to deliver the power of a $62 billion bank into every market with sophisticated products and services," Gregg says. <p>
Aggressive pursuit of the financial services market, combined with cost reductions made possible by centralized lines of business, he says, is one reason that PNC Bank had an after-tax profit margin of 25.75% in the second quarter. <p>
He attributes some of this profitability to cost controls: "In the financial services industry, the low-cost producers are the ones who are going to win the war."<p>
Also contributing to earnings growth, Gregg says, have been "acquisitions that have been intelligently priced and that have allowed us to implement ... our strategies."<p>
Using such efficiencies, he says, PNC Bank has been able to blend in acquisitions such as Sears Mortgage in November 1993 for $328 mil-lion. Sears brought in more than $27 billion in mortgage servicing. <p>
And in June, PNC agreed to acquire BlackRock Financial Management L.P. for 
$240 million in cash and notes, casting PNC as one of the larger managers of fixed-income assets. <p>
The five-year earnings story at the other banking institutions on the 1994 Top 10 list also has a strong narrative of acquisitions. <p>
Yet, as these companies are considerably smaller than the behemoth PNC, their acquisitions are of a different sort. <p>
Parkvale Savings, First Western, USBancorp, Fidelity and S&T all took advantage of fire-sale rates in acquiring properties of failed thrifts through the federal Resolution Trust Corp. at the turn of the decade. <p>
As a result, these institutions have strategically improved their geographic coverage, increased their customer bases and positioned themselves for the flurry of increased consumer and mortgage lending spurred by falling interest rates. After absorbing the costs of taking over new financial terrain, these companies have reaped earnings gains.<p>

<font size =+2>Parkvale Savings: </font size> 
As Parkvale was the first banking institution in the region to take over thrifts from the RTC, it was able to acquire 11 offices of Concord Liberty Savings and Loan for the low premium of 0.3% of the liabilities, officers say. <p>
Parkvale assumed Concord Liberty liabilities, totaling $210 million in late 1989, only a few months after the RTC had set up shop.<p>
This move, coupled with the bank's stock acquisition of Lyman Savings and Loan in Pittsburgh, increased Parkvale's size 40% -- from $538 million to $755 million -- virtually overnight.<p>
"We wanted to fill in gaps in our geographic network," says Timothy Rubritz, senior vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer.<p>
"When we acquired Concord, there weren't a lot of bidders," Rubritz recalls. "We got in at the very beginning, and we were in unknown territory."<p>
"There's no question that we leveraged our balance sheet to accomplish those transactions," says Robert J. McCarthy Jr., president and CEO. "The regulators had confidence in us and allowed us to go forward."<p>
Bank officers weren't certain whether they would bid because they weren't sure whether the RTC would accept their low figure of $650,000. "We weren't sure we were going to bid until the day we did it," says Rubritz.<p>
But, Rubritz says, the RTC was highly encouraging. " 'Go ahead,' they said. 'We may not be insulted.' "<p>
There was one catch: Parkvale had to move fast. The savings bank took over within a week.<p>
"We'd like to pursue other growth oppor-tunities as they become available," Rubritz adds.<p>
Parkvale has a compounded annual growth rate of 15.8%. In September, directors declared a 5-for-4 stock split.<p>
The company's return on average assets for the year that ended June 30 was 0.82%, and its return on average equity was 13.69%.<p>

<font size =+2>Fidelity Bancorp: </font size>
Like Parkvale, Fidelity increased its deposit base by 40% overnight, largely through RTC acquisitions.<p>
In November 1991, the company, owner of Fidelity Savings Bank, went from six to nine branches by acquiring two former Atlantic Financial Savings and Loan branches, one in Allison Park and another in Bloomfield.<p>
At the same time, Fidelity bought from Parkvale Savings Bank a former Concord Liberty Branch in Mount Lebanon.<p>
Richard G. Spencer, executive vice president, treasurer and chief financial officer, says that the premium Fidelity paid the RTC for the two Atlantic Financial branches -- 1.5% of the liabilities -- was a favorable rate, considering the access to new customers that the move afforded.<p>
"It was an easy call," Spencer says. "The opportunity presented itself. And interest rates were going down."<p>
He says the $235 million bank's earnings have been boosted by the new customers that the acquisitions brought.<p>
"We're looking for that core deposit customer. After all, it's hard to entice customers to try your bank. Do they need a credit card? A home-equity loan?"<p>
Fidelity's compounded annual growth of 14.9% includes projected earnings of $1.88 per share.<p>
For the quarter that closed June 30, Fidelity had a return on average assets of 0.7% and a return on average equity of 9.7%.<p>

<font size =+2>S&T Bancorp: </font size>
In 1991, the Indiana holding company bought through the RTC nine offices of Vanguard Savings and Loan, including two in Blairsville and one in Indiana, that were literally in sight of existing branches of S&T Bank. (S&T Bancorp later sold two of these branches, one in Pitcairn and another in Trafford, as they were on the fringe of the bank's marketing area.)<p>
"It was all or nothing -- a package deal," says Robert E. Rout, senior vice president and chief financial officer. "The new branches have given us synergy."<p>
S&T also acquired four offices of Atlantic Financial: one in Indiana (where S&T is headquartered), which were merged into existing S&T branches, and three others: Holiday Park, Westmoreland Mall and Youngwood.<p>
"This expanded our coverage to areas that were growing faster than where we are," says Robert D. Duggan, chairman and CEO.<p>
Access to this new market, along with vigilant cost controls, resulted in a double-digit growth in loan portfolio, much of it from Allegheny and Westmoreland counties, officers say.<p>
This fall, shares were split 2-for-1, bringing earnings to $1.60 per share. Compounded annual growth is 14.8%.<p>
For the quarter that closed June 30, S&T's return on average assets was 1.5%, and its return on average equity, 13.11%.<p>

<font size =+2>First Western Bancorp: </font size>
This year marks First Western's third consecutive appearance on the Top 10 list. Thomas J. O'Shane, president and CEO of the New Castle-based company, indicates that some of the same planning and acquisition moves that put the company on the list in 1993 and 1992 are keeping it there this year.<p>
"We made some very prudent acquisitions. And they were priced right," O'Shane says.<p>
The first of these was First Federal of Western Pennsylvania, a $350 million thrift, in 1990.<p>
"We paid book value at the time," says O'Shane. "Since then, we've converted its balance sheet to look like that of a community bank. It had never made more than $1.7 million. Last year, it made $4.3 million." Over four years, that's a 153% increase.<p>
Next came the acquisition of some RTC holdings of Colony Federal Savings Bank in 1991.<p>
"There was a premium on the deposits of nearly 4%. But we were able to buy $100 million in residential mortgage assets at a [15%] discount from face value. I can spend the next 25 years in banking and never pull another grand slam like that."<p>
A more recent factor pushing up earnings, O'Shane says, is a project to eliminate duplication throughout the organization.<p>
First Western has a compounded annual growth rate of 13.2%, based on projected earnings of $3 per share for this year.<p>
For the quarter that closed June 30, First Western registered a return on average assets of 1.15% and a return on average shareholders' equity of 15.54%.<p>

<font size =+2> USBancorp: </font size>
Like most of the other banking institutions on this year's list, USBancorp traces much of its earnings success to earlier acquisitions. But most of USBancorp's acquisitions, unlike the others, have resulted from private sales instead of RTC auctions.<p>
The most recent of these was the acquisition of Johnstown Savings Bank in June, $360 million in assets that were merged into U.S. Bank.<p>
In 1992, Johnstown-based USBancorp bought Community Savings Bank, adding another $350 million in assets, and in 1993, it acquired four offices of Integra Bank and wrapped them into Three Rivers Bank.<p>
USBancorp had already acquired the Century III Mall branch of Atlantic Financial from the RTC at a 2% premium. This branch proved fruitful in reaching new loan customers.<p>
"One reason we wanted the Century III branch was that we had a small branch near Allegheny County Airport that was not doing well," says Terry K. Dunkle, chairman, president and CEO.<p>
Another steady source of profits in recent years, Dunkle says, has been fee income from trust management services.<p>
USBancorp, which has a 26% market share in Cambria County, has a compounded annual growth rate of 11.5%, based on projected 1994 earnings of $2.54 per share. USBancorp had a return on average assets of 0.88% and a return on average equity of 9.65% for the quarter ending June 30.<p>
The stocks of these banking concerns emerged as some of the best performing securities in the region this year. Yet they joined a cadre of manufacturing companies that have become perennials on ER's Top 10 list in recent years.<p>

<font size =+2> Industrial Scientific: </font size>
The leader, Oakdale-based Industrial Scien-tific, manufactures compact gas monitors carried by police officers, pipe fitters, wastewater treatment workers, firemen, oil workers and safety inspectors.<p>
Company executives attribute this year's strong first-quarter sales to rapid market acceptance of a new model, the LTX310 multi-gas monitor. This is one of the company's three basic models in a newly designed line.<p>
"We had more than 20 models a year ago. Now we have three that do more, with interchangeable sensors," says Kent D. McElhattan, president and CEO.<p>
In April 1993, Congress passed regulatory legislation, originally proposed 20 years earlier, requiring gas monitoring in certain confined spaces. Industrial Scientific executives estimate that this may have increased the domestic market by 10% or more, but add that competition has sprung up concomitantly.<p>
McElhattan calls the LTX310 an "exact hit on the confined space legislation."<p>
The company has a new plant in Oakdale. "The new building was part of a strategy to treat employees properly," says McElhattan. "There are few [such] opportunities to put your money where your mouth is."<p>
Currently, about 5% of the company's sales are in exports. This year, Industrial Scientific received certification from Europe's International Organization for Standardization, a requirement for marketing such products on the continent. "We're the first in our field to be certified," says McElhattan.An international sales manager is now on the ground in Europe. "Certainly it's not going to happen overnight, but Europe has terrific potential," McElhattan adds.<p>
Industrial Scientific's compounded annual growth rate of 35% is based on projected earnings of $1.68 per share for 1994. The company's first-quarter sales this year increased 26.5% over the same period in 1993.<p>

<font size =+2> Mylan Laboratories: </font size>
After earning 93 cents a share in 1993, Mylan is projected to have earnings this year of $1.25, chalking up compounded annual growth of 30.3%. For the quarter that ended June 30, Mylan had net sales of $85.15 million, up from $58.5 million in the same period last year.<p>
One reason this Pittsburgh-headquartered manufacturer of generic drugs and original compounds is continuing to post such numbers, executives say, is the rapid distribution network the company has established in recent years.<p>
The company claims to have the fastest distribution in the business, with 97% of its orders delivered in three to five working days, says Patricia Sunseri, vice president for investor and public relations.<p>
In addition, Mylan has reaped increased sales from its inroads into new products through the 1991 purchase of Dow Hickam, a Texas-based wound- and burn-dressing manufacturer and the 1992 acquisition of Bertek Inc., a Vermont transdermal (patch medication) company.<p>
"Patient compliance is a big problem. If you put on a patch, you can't forget to take your medicine," says Sunseri, discussing the potential of the transdermal market.<p>
The chief attraction of Dow Hickam, she says, was the accomplished sales force. "This was important to our growth in mid-sized and large hospitals nationwide."<p>

<font size =+2>Respironics: </font size>
Including projected year-end earnings of $1.20 per share, Respironics of Murrysville has compounded annual growth of 30.2%. Net income for the quarter that ended March 31 was $2.24 million, up from $1.9 million for the same period of 1993.<p>
Controller Dan Bevevino attributes the contin-ued earnings growth, in part, to watching costs.<p>
"We look at our expenses monthly and our product costing monthly in a good bit of detail," he says.<p>
This manufacturer of various medical ventilation devices is headed by Gerald E. McGinnis, an engineer who founded the company in 1971 with $13,000 after a two-year stint in surgical research at Allegheny General Hospital.<p>
"I was an engineer, but my approach was more of a marketing approach. I learned over those early years that people wanted to buy a product that solves a problem.... At Allegheny General, I learned what those problems were. We define our mission as being a company that wants to be first to solve the problems of the pulmonary physician."<p>
Accordingly, McGinnis says, Respironics has profited from "differentiating ourselves [from] the hardware we're selling -- through service, teaching, informing and educating the customers."<p>
In late 1993, Respironics voluntarily recalled one of its products, the BagEasy resuscitator, because of a potential for it to malfunction, though the company received no reports of actual problems.<p>
The company announced this fall that it was putting a re-designed version of the product on the market.<p>
 
<font size =+2>Medrad: </font size>
With a compounded annual growth rate of 26.2%, Medrad's projected earnings for the year are $1.13, up from 90 cents in 1993.<p>
The manufacturer of medical imaging products continues to grow from an emphasis on new products, international expansion and cost reduction, says treasurer Gary W. Bucciarelli.<p>
"We invest 10% to 11% back into research and development," Bucciarelli says. "We're interested in expanding our market share and we do that by investing heavily in new products."<p>
This year, he says, the O'Hara-based company has put on the market 12 new products related to magnetic resonant imaging (MRI).<p>
"And we're continuing work on a new injec-tion system for CT [computed tomography] scans."<p>
This year, Medrad started a subsidiary in Italy and in 1993, one in Germany. It established an export hub in the Netherlands in the mid-1980s.<p>
"We're putting people and resources in places where we'll be able to expand," says Bucciarelli, citing as an example Germany, where sales have increased 74% since the company set up a subsidiary there.  <p>

PC Networks for Small Business </h2></B><br>
<FONT SIZE=+1><b>Low costs make PC networks an attractive investment for even the very smallest companies.</FONT SIZE></b><br>
<i>By John Schriefer, Illustrations by Joseph Fiedler</i>
<hr><P>
The personal computing revolution of the past decade has given rise to a paradox: The influx of PCs to businesses in the 1980s corresponded to a period of stagnant productivity among the office workers using them.
<p>
The crux of the problem is that many companies are not making full use of their computer resources. Says Brady Bisson, a manager in the business system consulting group at Deloitte & Touche LLP, "If you are just using word processing and spreadsheets to replace the typewriter or the pencil and ledger, that's not really going to help as much as if you take fuller advantage of the capabilities of the computers."
<p>
Most computer consultants and experienced computer users agree that one of the surest ways to overcome the productivity paradox is to tie PCs together in a network, in order to take advantage of the machines as data sharing devices. According to Joe Vetter, whose company Document Services Inc. last year installed a three PC network at its Ambridge headquarters, "The beauty of getting into the network is the cost is minimal for the power you can put at your disposal."
<p>
Another local company that has realized significant benefits from networking its PCs is Industrial Scientific Corp., a $30 million manufacturer of personal gas monitors in Oakdale.
<p>
Dennis Pike, chief engineer for product support, was one of the leading advocates for installing a network. Pike explains that he was looking for a way to automate the engineering revision process. The prior system involved changing original drawings on mylar and circulating blueprints for approval. "This whole business with paper was pretty nasty," he says.
<p>
In early 1993, the company installed a network to connect roughly two dozen PCs in the engineering department. According to Pike, the company now employs workflow automation software on the network to control the flow of engineering revisions and approvals. "The electronic document management system is a lot cleaner and a lot faster," he says.
<p>
Peter Schmalz, manager of engineering, says that the engineering department had to adjust its operating procedures to get the most out of the network. "As we changed to a network system we had to change the way we did some things. We weren't fully appreciative of everything that was going to have to be done differently. It took us a while to figure out the best way for us to do it.
"At first," he says, "it was a struggle ... but now that it is getting smoothed out, we are getting used to working in this environment. We are much more efficient."
<p>
According to Schmalz, the computer network has provided some unexpected benefits, including a better, more readily accessible record of engineering revisions for future reference. In the paper system, just searching for prior copies of drawings, he says, could take hours. Now, "people can look at the whole history in 10 minutes."
<p>
Though the system at Industrial Scientific was originally installed to benefit the engineering department, Schmalz says the success of the system led to fast expansion outside of the department. "Everybody wanted it," he says. Other departments that use the engineering drawings, such as manufacturing, purchasing and service, were given access to the network.
<p>
The PC network was also tied to the existing system used by the accounting department. According to Pike, it is more cost effective to add a PC workstation than it is to add a terminal directly connected to the accounting department's computer. "We get the same thing. [The PC] emulates the terminal on the [computer], and we can do a whole load of other things, using standard PC software," he says.
<p>
<FONT SIZE=+1><b>ISO 9000 Payoff </FONT SIZE></b><p>
"Another big influence driving it outside of engineering was our attempt to achieve ISO certification. This is where it really paid off," Pike says.
<p>
Preparing the documentation of processes and procedures within every department in the company "was becoming a monumental task," he says. To smooth the process, the company adapted its network workflow system to control the ISO 9000 documentation process. This provided a more efficient means of standardizing manuals created in different departments, and also made it possible to make changes on the fly. Pike says the company was able to respond to the findings of the ISO auditors during its one-week inspection. "By the time they left on Friday afternoon, we had cleared every finding."
<p>
Compelling as this success story is, it may appear that the benefits of networking are limited to larger organizations where many users are sharing information. Can small businesses reap similar benefits from networking? Ask Vetter, Document Services' company controller, and the response is a resounding yes.
<p>
According to him, last year when the company was purchased by a group of Pittsburgh investors, a decision was made to consolidate the accounting for the company's three offices--Ambridge, Detroit and Atlanta--at the Ambridge location. Previously, he says, the company had used an outside CPA firm in Detroit.
<p>
Vetter's objective was to plan and install a network for corporate accounting, and on-site operations for the secure document destruction business of the company. To minimize the expense of setting up the computer system, Vetter bought a used PC and other peripherals. Though he gave some thought to handling the entire installation project on his own, he relied on Pinnatech Computer Services of Allison Park to do the installation and provide other equipment.
<p>
In one Saturday, Pinnatech wired the offices and installed the network. That same day Vetter began to put his own software on the system, and it was up and running Monday morning.
<p>
Vetter, who has 20-plus years' experience using accounting systems on mainframe, minicomputer and PC-based networks, sees clear advantages of using PC networks, even in the smallest organizations. For one thing, he says, PC networks give small businesses the ability to computerize account and business management functions in-house inexpensively, instead of relying on outside CPAs or other consultants.
<p>
Besides maintaining greater control over operations, and doing more work at lower cost, the PC network enables employees to go beyond their traditional tasks and perform greater analysis of the data on the system. "Their efficiency really picks up," he says. "Also, there is a lot of drudgery that is now being removed." This gives workers a higher level of job satisfaction as they are able to exercise more creativity and make a greater contribution to the organization.
<p>
<FONT SIZE=+1><b>Security and Cost Savings</FONT SIZE></b><p>
Two other advantages of computer networks over unconnected PCs, according to many users and computer professionals, are improved data security and cost-efficient sharing of expensive peripheral devices like laser printers.
<p>
According to Mark Fantozzi, director of consulting at computer and network supplier RG Technology in Avalon, most individual PC users do not make backup copies of their data, which places valuable corporate information at risk. If a user's PC fails, the data is lost. At worst, this could threaten a company's survival, and at a minimum it may make additional work to recreate the data. In a typical client-server network, all critical data files are stored on a central PC server that is backed up every day. With centralized backup, says Mark Steward, president of Pinnatech, "You won't have George or Jane running to you at tax time saying, `My drive blew, I don't have a backup!' "
<p>
Despite the clear advantages to networking, managers have to weigh the potential benefits against likely costs. Bisson points out that "the cost of networking has come down significantly." Still, the costs are by no means negligible.
<p>
Assuming a company already has desktop PCs in place, Steward puts the cost for network hardware (NIC cards and wiring), software and installation at just under $600 per user on a 10-person network. Then add another $2,000 or $3,000, at minimum, for a centralized network server with large data storage capacity, a high quality power protection device and a data backup device. This does not include ongoing service and support or training for employees.
<p>
The costs are even higher if you are starting from scratch. For example, Vetter, who was able to buy some secondhand PCs and peripherals to minimize the cost of Document Services' system, says that the company has about $12,000 to $13,000 tied up in its five-user network.
<p>
Companies with existing hardware and software in place may also run up against additional, unforeseen costs. Among the typical unexpected expenses, according to Fantozzi, are the costs of purchasing new applications software, either to standardize the applications used throughout a company or to upgrade from outdated versions that will not work on the network. But it doesn't end there. Says Fantozzi, "If the new version doesn't do a conversion of data real well, then we may have to convert your data. That is more cost."
<p>
<FONT SIZE=+1><b>Don't Cut Training</FONT SIZE></b><p>
When decision-makers become fully aware of the costs, says Fantozzi, "They always try to trim back, and the one place where they almost immediately trim back is training." That is nearly always a mistake, experts say. <p>
Bob Ryberg, director of operations at RG Technology, gives a useful analogy. "If Port Authority said, `We are going to hire a lot of new drivers, but we are going to cut back on training on how to drive a bus,' [they] are going to have a lot of accidents. So they say, `When we hire, we train.' " Likewise, he says, companies must emphasize training to overcome employee fear of the unknown technology and to get the most out of the investment in people and machines.
<p>
According to Bisson, training also sets a tone that emphasizes manage-ment's commitment to using the network. "Training employees and getting them involved in the process makes them feel comfortable that management is behind that activity."<p>
Employee involvement, however, should come long before the network is installed, in planning what kind of system to install. In the case of Industrial Scientific, key operational personnel, specifically Pike, were involved in determining what the system would do. But Pike was not initially involved in the purchasing decision. As a result, he says that the company originally purchased a network that "was very complex and very cumbersome" to use with the company's PCs. As a result of the imperfect fit between the network's server and the PC workstations used by employees, Pike later lobbied to replace the network with the PC-based system currently in use. <p>
In Document Services' case, Vetter was the point man in planning and purchasing the system. From this experience, Vetter sees a lesson for other companies: "The one thing that would stick out is that there has to be some ownership of the network at the location. You could have a consultant, and they could come in and ... build a Cadillac when all you need is a Ford. So you have to have some kind of understanding of what your requirements are."
Besides planning the network, Vetter believes this ownership must carry over to network operations, so that the company has a person who understands enough to perform basic backup and troubleshooting, but who also knows when it is time to call out for help. "There has to be a person with the time and initiative to get involved. You can't just turn it on and let it play by itself," he says.
<p>
Bisson strongly recommends using suppliers as on-call network trouble-shooters by purchasing service contracts when you buy equipment. "That is a cost savings, because you don't need a real seasoned MIS staff." Steward likens his company's network service and support contracts to the services he gets from a CPA. Pinnatech employees could do the company's books, but, he says, "We have accountants do our books because they can save us money in the long run."
<p>
Similarly, Steward cautions against do-it-yourself network installation, even in fairly simple cases. "We make a living going out and fixing other people's problems." Even if a company has internal computer know-how to draw on, they may do better turning to a specialist. Says Steward, "If time is money to the company, they are going to want us to do it because they are going to save a lot of time and effort." A typical installation, he says, takes one Saturday afternoon; the customer has no downtime.
<p>
According to Bisson, lower costs make networking a viable option for many smaller businesses. And, as many users will attest, networks open up possibilities for employees and managers to accomplish more in a workday and to change for the better how they get things done. Pike, Schmalz and Vetter are hard-pressed to imagine how a company could not benefit from networking their computers.
<p>
But before companies make a leap for the technology, they must determine what specific problem or process the network is meant to address. If the problem is simply a lack of productivity of computers in one's organization, the immediate solution may not be to throw more technology (i.e., a network) at the user. Rather, the challenge may be to modernize the work force.
<p>
To borrow a maxim from the retail industry, the three most important things in employing computers in the workplace are training, training and training.

Education: Target Marketing </h2></B><br>
<FONT SIZE=+1>
Colleges and universities are 
becoming increasingly sophisticated 
in targeting their audiences.
</FONT SIZE><br><i>By Lydia Strohl  (8 pages)</i>

<p>
Institutions of higher education used to think that marketing was beneath them. But decreasing numbers of high school graduates, a decline in test scores and a proliferation of higher education options has forced schools to compete for top students.
<p>
"In 1979, the word marketing was an unspoken thing," says Kathy Greuter, vice president of the National Research Center for College and University Admissions. "It was commercial; it had nothing to do with black robes and pillars. Just in the last five to 10 years that word has become very acceptable in college communities --  they had to seek the help of experts."
<p>
That movement led to a plethora of new titles infiltrating college administration, like director of enrollment management and director of enrollment marketing. They talk about target marketing, mission statements and the four Ps: price, product, promotion and placement. But far from evoking winces from the hallowed halls, these new techniques are being embraced.
<p>
"Back in the olden days, in the late '60s and early '70s, we were the gatekeepers," says Kevin Altomari, executive associate director of admissions and financial aid at the University of Pittsburgh. "We collected applications and decided who got in --  there were lots vying for a few spaces. Now it's a buyer's market, and institutions need to find a way to market themselves uniquely among their peers."
<p>
Schools are becoming increasingly sophisticated in targeting their audiences; they buy lists, peruse applications from their own students for commonalities and look at national demographics to see which areas have a dearth of the educational opportunity they are offering. They target these audiences with intense media campaigns, which include television, radio, print and even billboard ads. They undertake mass mailings of slick publications. They visit high schools across the nation, ask alumni to represent them in their home communities and court high school counselors.
<p>
But it is what they're saying that has become the important part. No longer is teaching theory enough. Colleges and universities are finding it necessary to prove that their education is relevant for today's market.
<p>
"The buzz [phrase] is: What will I be prepared to do when I graduate?' " says Jim Emrietti, dean of enrollment at Carlow College. "We are a liberal arts college with a keen eye toward orientation in earning a living. Not many students these days are professing a desire to learn purely for learning's sake."
<p>
Chatham College, which vetoed going co-ed in 1991, has modified its program to better prepare women students for the working world. The administration guarantees opportunities for two internships to each student, and has instituted cooperative programs. Chatham students can take an engineering or teaching degree in conjunction with Carnegie Mellon University. Another program guarantees early admission to medical school. Alums are called on for career and professional advice. And the school has started master's programs in both physical and occupational therapy, in response to growing demand in these professions.
<p>
"We chose to be an Olympic training village rather than a protected cloister," says Dr. Esther Barazzone, president of Chatham College. "We felt we needed to offer broader opportunities if we were truly taking women's aspirations seriously."
<p>
<FONT SIZE=+1><b>
Following Job Trends </FONT SIZE></B> <p>
It is common for schools to follow employment trends when choosing program direction. Duquesne University's School of Health Sciences, which was developed five years ago, now has 700 students.
"We have added 46 new programs in six years," says Dr. John Murray, president of Duquesne University. "We look at societal needs, and talk to people doing it for a living."
<p>
One example of practical partnering is going on at Point Park College, which has developed an environmental protection science major in conjunction with the Environmental Protection Agency.
"The EPA found they had to retrain college graduates," says Dr. J. Matthew Simon, president of Point Park College. "These students are ready to hit the road running when they graduate."
<p>
Examples of niche filling can be found all over the region. Washington & Jefferson College has an entrepreneurial management program; Point Park offers a degree in mortuary science. Butler County Community College does training in total quality and computer-aided design for local corporations.
<p>
Robert Morris College is responding to feedback from the business world by changing its curriculum across the board to incorporate training in an area executives proclaimed a major gap in student preparation: communication.
<p>
"Students follow jobs--parents do too--and they're savvy consumers. In the past, many of us forgot that," says Dr. Edward Nicholson, president of Robert Morris, where the dominant degrees are in science and business administration. "We asked our advisory board what they would change for graduates, and without hesitation they said, `Why can't students write better? They can't give a good presentation. They aren't articulate in front of a group.' "
<p>
The program change will increase the core communications requirement from two to nine courses, beginning in 1995. Four of these courses must be communication-intensive offerings within the student's major, in which they are graded on knowledge, writing skills and oral presentation.
<p>
These programs are marketed to an increasingly wide geographic range. Many schools in the region that traditionally drew primarily from western Pennsylvania now have national and international representation in their ranks. Of this year's University of Pittsburgh freshman class, 25% are from Allegheny County, down from 50% 10 years ago. Duquesne University's 1994 freshman class represents all 50 states and 82 nations.
<p>
International affiliations have become a mainstay of universities around the region. Washington & Jefferson has relationships with universities in England, and is developing them with colleges in Mexico and perhaps Colombia. Duquesne has affiliations with universities in Pakistan, Spain and some African countries.
"These are not just junior year abroad programs," says Murray. "We have both student and faculty exchanges. They increase diversity and point of view on the campus. It's a new dimension in education."
<p>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>
Comes Down to Money</FONT SIZE></B> <p>
Most schools add programs that dovetail with existing offerings, or need few additional resources.
"We look at programming in terms of what we can do with relatively little money," says Nicholson of Robert Morris College. The school added football this year, attracting 150 new students for an investment of $452,000--the cost of a practice field, locker room and equipment--$150,000 of which was a gift. "We're not, for example, going to start a new music school," he says.
<p>
Nonetheless, expanding programs and attracting new students often means investing in new facilities and equipment. Last fall, La Roche College completed a $6 million fitness center, and is planning a new dormitory and an academic building for a total cost of $12 million. These buildings include facilities for not only La Roche itself but also the whole North Hills community, with additions like a gallery and video editing lab.
<p>
"We intend to be a resource for the North Hills," says Sister Carolyn Winschel, vice president at La Roche. "The NAACP, Il Campanoli and the Ebony Women meet here already, and the library is open to all North Hills library cardholders. It's probably not the only reason, but when we opened the gym our freshman class increased from 119 to 160."  
<p>
Rather than build a clinic for their nurse anesthetist program, however, 
La Roche uses five area hospitals for the clinical portion of that degree. Affiliations like this profit the school by requiring little investment and attracting students, and benefit the students by giving them real world experience.
<p>
New dimensions often target specific audiences. A drop in numbers of high school graduates (8.3% nationwide from 1988 to 1993), prodded many colleges and universities to provide offerings to attract nontraditional students.
"Attendance is up at our off-campus learning centers," says Dr. Bill Katip, vice president for enrollment services at Geneva College in Beaver County. "Twenty years ago we didn't recruit at all. But today is a different ball game all together, with the decline in traditional students. Especially in Beaver County, where we have lost half of our high school classes."
Geneva College has extension programs in Moon, Philadelphia, New Castle, Butler, Monroeville and the South Hills. It offers a degree completion program, which has more than 300 enrollees with an average age of 37.5.
<p>
This entree by four-year residential colleges into evening and weekend classes raids the traditional realm of the community college. So, in an effort to keep numbers steady, community colleges have increasingly appealed to the traditional student. This proliferation of higher education options being aggressively marketed to students, believes Don Munce, president of NRCCUA, probably accounts for the increase in percentage of students entering college. In 1984, 44% of Pennsylvania high school seniors went on to some form of higher education; in 1994, that number jumped to 64%.
<p>
"There are less students to go around, but more are going to college," says Munce. "More and more colleges are after students, and that encourages them to go. Plus, they can work and go to school right in their hometown."
<p>
Enrolling in part-time and community college courses also takes the financial sting out of higher education. With tuition rising about 5% a year among local institutions, students are looking for the best buys.
<p>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>
Price Shopping </FONT SIZE></B><p>
"We find a lot of competitive advantage in being the most affordable institution of higher education in Allegheny County," says Dave Egan, director of public relations at the Community College of Allegheny County. According to a study done by Executive Report, tuition at CCAC as of August 1994 was $1,488; community colleges in Butler and Westmoreland counties are comparably low.
<p>
On the high end are Carnegie Mellon University at $16,960 per year and Washington & Jefferson at $15,360 annually. The range is complete in between, from Pitt and Penn State at $4,962 and $3,602 respectively, to Carlow College at $9,826 and Seton Hill at $10,240 annually.
<p>
To help potential students afford education, colleges are offering a variety of programs. In some of their majors, Point Park offers "College-Fast," an accelerated, fixed tuition program.
"Two things work together to yield a 30% savings," says Simon. "No increases are passed along during those years, and you finish the degree in three years, rather than four."
<p>
Schools offer a variety of financial aid incentives: state-affiliated schools give breaks to Pennsylvania residents; others will raise money for scholarships or provide the money themselves. Robert Morris, which offered $200,000 in institutional aid in 1989, awarded more than $1 million in 1994.
<p>
A common practice now is discounting, where the institution lowers its cost to entice a potential student without getting that money from another source, in essence, eating the difference.
"Financial aid is often awarded as colleges are working much harder to recruit students than in the past," says Greuter. "But they can't give away too much or there will be no revenue stream from tuition. Giving more aid means cutbacks, and when those reach recruiting and marketing it means less students and less tuition. It's a self-fulfilling prophecy."
<p>
Schools are spending ever more on recruitment and marketing efforts. Duquesne University now spends $700 to recruit a student. Geneva College's Katip estimates that the college spends an average of $2,000 per student in recruiting and marketing, a figure that's doubled over the past 10 years. Nicholson says that in the last five years, Robert Morris' promotional budget has increased 600%, from $75,000 to $425,000.
<p>
But it seems to be paying off.  The colleges around the region are finding their niches and report that they are pleased with attendance levels. To most this means that the niche fits.
"We are looking for the match. We want to recruit graduates, not just students," says Katip. "Half of the students that come here are first generation college students. We are a blue-collar campus. A lot of our students say it is easier for them to fit in here than it was in high school."
<p>
Top of mind for most college administrators seems to be matching values with those their student desires. But whether a student is looking for a blue-collar, Catholic, community-service, all-women, urban, rural, technical or liberal arts environment, they have a friend in western Pennsylvania.

<FONT SIZE=+3><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="../pictures/editor.gif"> </FONT SIZE><FONT SIZE=+2>Beam Us Up Scotty </FONT SIZE><i> By Jane A. Black</i><P>
With this issue, our 150th, Executive Report proudly enters the electronic age. We are now on the Internet, a vast confederation of computer databases and users. While Internet is not the much talked about information superhighway, it is a publishing and communications medium to be reckoned with. <p>

Internet is a government spawned network, that, at press time, has 25 million users in over 150 countries. (About 2 million users are signing on every month.) In western Pennsylvania, there are some 100,000 Internet users. <p>

Executive Report, like other magazines and newspapers, really had little choice in whether to get on the Internet, or some other on-line service. Why? Because, as Rosalind Resnick, publisher of the Interactive Publishing Alert, notes, "aspiring publishers with nothing more than a personal computer and a modem will soon be eating [our] lunches" if we don't get in on the act. Consider this: More than 2,700 newspapers are now experimenting with some kind of electronic venture. In 1989, there were just 42 plugging in. <p>

Being on the 'Net certainly has its rewards -- for all the new people we are reaching, we have none of the traditional printing or distribution costs. We haven't had to pay one extra penny for paper, presses or postage. <p>

There are other advantages. We will be able to track how many people have looked at our publication, and solicit reader feedback in a user-friendly way. Armed with such knowledge, we will be able to better address the wants and needs of readers when it comes time to plan the editorial calendar.  <p>

Certainly there are those who think that the new electronic media sounds the knell for more traditional concerns such as newspapers and magazines. But as Donald D. Kummerfeld points out in Folio, radio didn't kill off print, and television did not snuff out radio or print. "What new media do is force each old medium to redefine what it does best," Kummerfeld says. Indeed. And these new media will go far in helping us in that endeavor. <p>

Truly this is an exciting time for publishers and editors. We are in the embryonic stages of a new economy, one that is being propelled by technology and information. This information age will be as different as the industrial revolution was from the agricultural era. <p>
Not long ago, I read that there is more information in one Sunday New York Times than my great-grandparents encountered in a lifetime. If the information explosion continues at its current pace, the world's knowledge base will double every 70 days by 2010. Here's to surviving the information overload. <p>

<font size =+2>Some Taxing Matters</font size><p>
I found "Tax-Deferred Annuities: More Taxing Than Commonly Believed" by Richard D. Rosen in the September 1994 issue to be filled with generalities and misinformation.
There are two points by Mr. Rosen I consider factual: Annuities are not for everybody and tax deferral may not be an advantage. Beyond [this], I find Mr. Rosen's analysis of annuities lacking.
<dl>
He lists six points following the statement "Most annuities also have the following disadvantages." I would like to address each:
<LI> Variable annuities often have high expense charges. However, there are more than a few which don't. Furthermore, an alternative -- a regular mutual fund -- usually either carries a load with an expense fee or no load but the same 2% fee structure or higher! 99.99% of all fixed annuities have no expense charges at all!
<LI> The state premium tax applies only to funds in non-qualified annuities. If you use an annuity to fund your IRA, SEP, or profit-sharing plan, there is no tax. Also, [with] a non-qualified annuity, there are a few companies who [pay the tax for you] or add it to the surrender charge; as the charge disappears, so does the tax. Either way, the tax does not come out of the annuitant's deposit.
<LI> Twenty years ago annuities did charge upfront sales charges. Today, I know of no annuity which carries an upfront load. A seller of an annuity does make a commission, typically 4% to 5% of the amount invested, but it does not come out of the investor's deposit, [it] is paid by the annuity company.
<LI> [The fourth] statement is basically accurate, except for one omission -- most annuities allow the annuitant to have 10% of his funds after the first policy anniversary without any surrender charge. This gives the annuitant access in an emergency, yet protects the company so it can credit a better long-term rate to invested funds. The surrender periods help the company price the product, and pay the selling agent. But again, there is almost never an upfront sales charge.
<LI> [The fifth point is] definitely true, and the prime reason why no one under age 45 should consider buying a non-qualified annuity. However, IRAs, 401(k)s, and other qualified money are subject to the same penalty. Someone looking to piggyback their fully funded retirement plan should consider the annuity part of the plan. Also, if the annuity is to be used inside an IRA, 401(k), etc., the pre-59 1/2 rules already apply.
<LI> The annuities available today have provisions that completely contradict 
Mr. Rosen's statement [on withdrawal limitations]. How about an annuity that will pay out interest monthly, directly to your checking account? How about [one] that allows you access any time without penalty if you have to go into a nursing home? How about an annuity that guarantees to pay out the minimum distribution required by the IRS on IRA accounts for people over age 70 1/2? How about a split-annuity?
</DL>
Mr. Rosen [says] that annuities should be considered only as a replacement for "ordinary income-type investments." Not true! A fixed annuity is ideal for someone wanting to secure their hard earned dollars. People nearing/in retirement should be looking at annuities as an alternative to non-guaranteed accounts such as stocks, bonds and related mutual funds. They should see them as having the advantage over guaranteed CDs because of higher credited interest rates and the tax deferral! <p>
It is interesting that not one word was mentioned about probate. Annuities generally escape probate costs and thus keep settlement costs down. <p>
Mr. Rosen's premise [was] "tax deferral isn't all it's cracked up to be," but I believe the implication is that the only objective advisors are those who don't sell, but consult. <p>
I must be cautious not to get involved in the "unauthorized practice of law" and to be wary of dishing out tax advice. I've never heard of someone telling an attorney or CPA to dispense from the "unauthorized practice of insurance" and to keep from evaluating financial products. <p>
<i>Stephen E. Fuhrer, ChFC, Fuhrer's Inc.</i><p>

<b>Editor's note:</b> <i>Mr. Fuhrer's letter was edited for space. A response from the article's author, also edited for space, follows. </i>
<hr>
[My] thesis ... was that many people purchasing variable annuities focus on tax deferral and are unaware of tax disadvantages, expenses on returns and the inflexibility of these instruments. The tax disadvantages which were the focus of my article were: <p>
Variable annuities convert long-term capital gains into ordinary income.
<DL>
Variable annuities cause certain appre-ciation to be taxed as ordinary income.
<LI> I stated that annual expense charges reduce the rate of return. Mr. Fuhrer admits that "variable annuities often have high expense charges." However, he asserts that mutual funds, including no-loads, purchased outside of an annuity have "the same 2% fee structure or higher!" In actuality, the expense ratios of most no-loads are well below 2%, although some are this high. With respect to my failing to mention that most fixed annuities have no expense charge -- [Mr. Fuhrer] apparently misunderstood. I was cautioning readers to consider the expense charge when projecting returns on variable annuities. There obviously are expense charges even in fixed annuities. They simply are not separately stated.
<LI> I pointed out the 2% Pennsylvania premium tax. Mr. Fuhrer [says] this tax doesn't apply if you buy the annuity inside a qualified retirement plan. I don't know why anyone would buy a variable annuity inside such a plan. The plan itself provides the tax deferral.
<LI> I had no evil purpose in my use of the phrase "sales commission" as opposed to "sales charge."
<LI> Mr. Fuhrer correctly points out that most annuities permit annual withdrawals of up to 10% of the annuitant's funds without any surrender charge. Unfortunately, the IRS in many cases will impose a 10% penalty on such withdrawals.
<LI> Mr. Fuhrer agrees that there is a 10% income tax penalty on any earnings withdrawn from an annuity before the investor reaches 59 1/2. His rebuttal is that the same penalty applies to withdrawals from qualified plans. [That] is irrelevant. My article is comparing mutual funds bought inside annuities to mutual funds bought directly.
<LI> Mr. Fuhrer feels my statement that annuities impose limitations on the timing and manner of withdrawals is out of date. To support his position, he asserts that today's annuities allow you to access your funds at any time without surrender charge "if you have to go into a nursing home" or will "pay out the interest earned monthly directly to your checking account." When compared to the availability of money invested in mutual funds outside of an annuity, I'm not impressed.
</DL>
Mr. Fuhrer takes exception to my statement that annuities should be considered only as a replacement for "ordinary income-type investments." Mr. Fuhrer states that "people nearing/in retirement should be seriously looking at annuities as an alternative to non-guaranteed accounts such as ... mutual funds." Good advice, but irrelevant. My point was that an investor who has determined that he should invest in mutual funds will generally be better off doing so outside a variable annuity. I indicated that when ordinary income-type investments such as CDs are the preferred investment, fixed annuities will sometimes be preferable and listed the criteria to be examined in order to make this determination. <P>
Mr. Fuhrer's final point was that annuities avoid probate. If payable to a beneficiary other than the annuitant's estate, this is correct. My article was not intended to be an encyclopedic treatment of annuities. I was attempting to restore some balance by pointing out matters under-emphasized in sales literature.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+3><IMG ALIGN=bottom SRC="GuestEditor.gif"> </FONT SIZE><FONT SIZE=+2>Why Building Codes and Politics Don't Mix</FONT SIZE><br><i>By Roger L. Kingsland</i><P>
Last spring, I came across a cover story in a local magazine featuring New York City real estate developer Richard Penzer. With great interest, I started to read it but soon became alarmed at Penzer's suggestion that the city relax its building codes in order to make it easier for him to develop projects in Pittsburgh. <p>
Several of my colleagues were also alarmed at this possibly danger-ous mix of politics and public safety. Therefore, on behalf of the American Institute of Architects (AIA), we wrote a letter to the mayor's office warning the dangers of changing a model building code for political reasons. While it's always tempting to attract outside money to invest in Pittsburgh, City Hall should realize that making adaptations to building codes as a result of lobbying efforts can have far-reaching ramifications -- all negative.  <p>
Understanding that there is no shortage of important issues for the mayor and the rest of City Hall to address, we were not surprised when we didn't receive a response. However, it's still an important issue of which the public and local business community should be aware.  <p>
Although it would seem relatively simple to change just a few aspects of the building code, it's important to understand that building codes represent minimum life safety standards. They are established through rigorous research and constant updating by the sponsoring agency (in this case, BOCA, the Building Officials & Code Administrators International Inc.). In combination, all of the aspects of a building code are intended to ensure an adequate, practical level of life safety. Building code decisions should be made by people with technical expertise in life safety issues, not by politicians or real estate developers. <p>
When examined, Penzer's intimation that Pittsburgh's building code is inflexible (and thereby hinders downtown development) is found wanting. BOCA, recognizing the need for code flexibility, adopted Article 32 in 1985, which established a numerical rating for various components of building safety for adaptive reuse of existing structures. As long as architects achieve an overall minimum score, they are free to choose the best combination of building safety components relative to the specific building.  <p>
There is yet further evidence to support our contention that Pittsburgh's building codes should not be relaxed. For example, the BOCA code was adopted locally in 1981 specifically to replace the then antiquated 1947 city of Pittsburgh code with a nationally recognized standard. Second, the BOCA code is one of three model building codes in use in the country. Each of them is constantly being updated by recognized technical experts in building safety. A new edition of the code is issued every three years, and we hope that the city, which is presently using the 1990 edition, adopts the already published 1993 version soon. <p>
The BOCA code is viewed so favorably that Pennsylvania, which has not had a state building code for over 20 years (and is one of the few states in the nation without one), has begun the legislative process to adopt it as the code for the entire commonwealth. <p>
But let's not forget the most important aspect of a good building code that affects everyone: "It helps ensure the health, safety and welfare of the general public." Architects, as licensed design professionals, are morally, ethically and legally bound to protect that health, safety and welfare of the general public. <p>
So let's think twice when someone, no matter how good his or her intentions may be, suggests that a building code be changed to make development more attractive. It may be possible to make codes more adaptable to specific forms of commercial development. However, the decision should be based on hard research and conclusions arrived at by experts in the field of public safety. In the long run, we're all better off keeping political influence out of the realm of public safety, still one of the primary roles of government.  <p>
In the opinion of the Pittsburgh chapter of the American Institute of Architects, Pittsburgh is and will continue to be a viable market for downtown development, as evidenced by the building surge in the 1980s (e.g., One Oxford Centre, One Mellon Center, CNG Tower, Fifth Avenue Place, The Vista Hotel, The Pennsylvanian, et al.). Such investment has carried through to today, typified by the recent redevelopment of the Cultural District and elsewhere. Relaxing our building codes sounds like good sense on the surface, but will only threaten public safety in the end. According to the aforementioned article, New York City may have "looked the other way" regarding its codes when Penzer came calling, but we've proven it's not necessary in order to promote both investment in the city and public safety.  <p>

<p>
The month ending Oct. 14 was another good one for western Pennsyl-vania stocks. The ER Index, which is com-prised of 25 area companies, improved 0.25%, while the S&P 500 declined 1.2% for the same period. Since the start of the index on Aug. 15, the ER Index is up nearly 8.9% vs. 1.71% for the S&P 500. <p>
The advance has been led primarily by a resurgence in technology issues, including Fore Systems, Black Box Corp., Legent and Cable Design Technologies, each of which recorded strong gains during the month. Fore Systems, the leader in local area networking products based on the fast growing ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) technology, exploded more than one-third, to 50 1/2 per share from 37 3/4, during the month. The Warrendale-based company announced it would supply Hewlett-Packard with its ATM adapter cards. <p>
Black Box Corp. moved up more than 8.5% for the month, to 12 3/4. The company announced a record quarter ended Sept. 30, with revenues up 15% and earnings up 34%. The company continues to steadily pay down debt, and also announced a new product sourcing program that should cut costs by $6 million over the next three years. Black Box Corp., which is headquartered in Lawrence, is the world's leading direct marketer of networking and connectivity products. <p>
<DL>
<LI>It was not a good month for rail stocks, however. MK Rail and Johnstown America Corp. both plunged. MK Rail, which primarily remanufactures locomotives, announced for the second time in as many quarters that results would be disappointing. The company cited higher than expected costs as the main culprit. The stock sank to its lowest levels since coming public in April, before recovering somewhat. At 10 3/4, MK Rail is selling for about half of its high for the year, 21. 
Johnstown America, which manufactures coal and intermodal cars, dropped 24% for the month, to 20 1/2. Concerns over earnings and ongoing negotiations for a new labor agreement with the steelworkers union in Johnstown, combined with an untimely exit out of the stock by a couple of the company's former venture investors, helped to push it down. Management, by the way, is extremely bullish about the company's prospects.
<LI>Speaking of steelworkers, it seems that the 10-week strike against Allegheny Ludlum earlier this year was so successful that 470 of the company's 2,000 salaried workers now want to join the union.
When was the last time you can recall blue-collar employees complaining about mandatory overtime? It seems just a short time ago workers were shoving each other out of the way to work overtime. Not anymore. At manufacturing plants around the country, and Pittsburgh is no exception, the recent upsurge in factory utilization rates, combined with continuing downsizing, seems to be taking its toll. It is clear that while people may differ about where we stand in the current economic cycle, there is little doubt that the recovery is resulting in some significant fatigue on the plant floor. As one local labor leader said to us the other day, "What ever happened to the 40-hour workweek?"

<LI>Mylan Laboratories continued its impressive rise, tacking on 1 5/8, or 6.3%, for the month, closing at 27 5/8. Mylan announced it would sell a generic version of Eli Lillys antibiotic drug, Ceclor, for Lilly. It is the latest in a string of such announcements. Mylan has recently entered similar arrangements with SmithKline, Upjohn and Pfizer.
<LI>American Eagle Outfitters recorded a 47.9% increase in sales for the five weeks ending Oct. 1. Same store sales rose 4.1%. Sales for the nine weeks ended Oct.1 rose 53.9%, to $48.5 million. American Eagle, which has opened an astounding 21 stores so far this quarter, plans to have an additional 28 ready for the holiday selling season.
<LI>Dravo announced it would sell its construction aggregates business to Martin Marietta Materials for about $130 million. Dravo, which had been seeking a buyer for some time, says it intends to focus on other areas within its lime business.
<LI>Respironics, which voluntarily pulled its popular line of BagEasy disposable manual resuscitators off the market last year after some minor defects were discovered, announced it has received approval from the U.S. Food & Drug Administration to resume selling a new family of resuscitators, which have been "comprehensively redesigned." The new product has two-thirds fewer parts and requires two-thirds fewer operations to manufacture than the former line. At a presentation in New York, the company's chief financial officer, Dennis Meteny, was extremely upbeat about the company's opportunities in the non-invasive respiratory market. Respironics' stock price, which tumbled to 16 last year and has since recovered to about 20, is still selling well below the company's growth rate.

<FONT SIZE=+2>Taking a Page from Mellon</FONT SIZE><br>
Mellon Bank has made its way between the covers of a relatively new book on business process reengineering (BPR) as one of 11 case studies. The book, "Beyond the Basics of Reengineering: Survival Tactics for the '90s," takes a holistic look at one of the latest management philosophies sweeping the business world.<P>
BPR has been defined by its creator, Dr. Michael Hammer, as "the fundamental rethinking and radical redesign of business process to achieve dramatic improvements in critical, contemporary measures of performance, such as cost, quality, service and speed." The Kodak Co. is credited with being the first to use formal BPR methodology as introduced by Hammer in 1990.<P>
Fitzwilliam, N.H.-based Consultant News publisher Jim Kennedy says BPR is "no different than dozens of other fads that have preceded it," adding that it is past the wild acceptance and digestion stages and on to the disillusionment stage.<P>

A survey of chief information officers in North America by Deloitte & Touche, however, indicates that two-thirds of the responding CIOs were somewhat satisfied or very satisfied with the results of their companies' business process reengineering efforts.<P>
The coverage of Mellon in "Beyond the Basics of Reengineering" focuses on changes in the company's master trust services area. Mellon, through its business performance improvement department, has designed an ambitious BPR plan for the trust department which uses technology and forward-minded methodologies to satisfy a sophisticated, demanding customer and to gain an edge in a growing, lucrative market.<P>
The goal is to revolutionize the way Mellon processes and services 401(k) accounts. A new workflow management system was to be rolled out over a period of nine months. If successful, other areas in the bank such as private asset management, jumbo mortgages, global securities, global asset management, investment services and investment products may get in on the act.<P>
"Beyond the Basics of Reengineering" was published in May by the Institute of Industrial Engineers in Norcross, Ga. IIE is a nonprofit, international professional association of more than 30,000 members whose principle endeavor is produc-tivity and quality improvement through systems integration. There is a Pittsburgh chapter.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2>Pay Slide</FONT SIZE><br>
According to a survey by Hewitt Associates, Pittsburgh area employees have experienced a decline in salary increases over the past two years.<P>
The survey compared both local and national salary increases in relation to executive groups, unions, non-unions, exempts and non-exempts.<P>

Mike Lee of Hewitt Associates' Pittsburgh office sees two reasons for the decline: national fixed costs and result-based pay. Lee believes there is a trend toward companies' managing costs conservatively.<P>
"Companies do not want higher costs so they are focusing the pay on performance," says Lee. "If results are there, the rewards are there."<P>
Downsizing, on the other hand, is a trend that is not a direct result of salary figures.<P>
"In many cases, companies need to figure that in the long run they will have to pay people more because of additional duties," says Lee. "When they downsize, they put more responsibilities on others."<P>
The market and the cost of living in Pittsburgh are two factors that Lee says are keeping employees here regardless of salary figures.<P>
"Pittsburgh is an attractive place to work and live," says Lee. "People would rather look long and hard for a job than move away. So once you take these factors into consideration, the figures really aren't so surprising."<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2>Lawyers' Lawyers</FONT SIZE><br>
Aiken, S.C.-based Woodward/White Inc. has released the results of its biennial survey identifying the "best and brightest" in the legal profession.<P>
Based on a 12-month poll of lawyers across the country, this year's list contains 13,417 lawyers nationwide, slightly more than 1% of the nation's 862,954 lawyers. Four new categories -- banking, franchise, workers' compen-sation and legal malpractice -- have been added, and the number of women lawyers listed has increased by 68%.<P>
This year's effort involved 15,000 letters and 32,000 phone calls. The company routinely couched its inquiries in the following terms: "If you had a close friend or relative who needed [for example] a real estate lawyer, and you couldn't handle the case yourself for reasons of conflict of interests or time, to whom would you refer them?"<P>
The company indicates in the introduction the possible problems with this methodology, but the editors maintain that these lists represent the "most useful guide to the best lawyers in the United States ever compiled."<P>
Published results appear in the "The Best Lawyers in America: 1995-1996," which comes out this month. This sixth edition is priced at $110.<P>
Four hundred and eighty-four of the listed lawyers are from Pennsylvania. The accom-panying list shows the number of lawyers from Executive Report's readership area.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2>Active County</FONT SIZE><br>
The economic surge taking place in Armstrong County in past months is making it "The Best Thing Next To Pittsburgh," like its new slogan states.<P>
Recent marketing strategies and new businesses have left the sixth-class county with a new outlook on the business world.<P>
The county recently kicked off a two-year economic development marketing program. Richard Palilla, executive director of the department of planning and development, says that both the Chamber of Commerce and the board of directors wanted to reintroduce the county to western Pennsylvania businesses, so they developed a plan.<P>
But even before the campaign began, Armstrong County was starting to attract more businesses to the area.<P>
On July 1, the former Moonlight Mushroom farm went back into operation under new management as Creekside Mushrooms Ltd. Creekside has more than 150 employees and hopes to double the figure later this year.<P>
Leading Technologies, a division of Composide Inc. that manufactures semiconductor lead frames and other interconnect products, began operating in a 67,000-square-foot spot in the Parks Bend Farms Industrial Park in September.<P>
The company has 30 employees. That number is expected to grow to 100 over the next three years.<P>
The Speedex Tractor Corp. also became the largest tenant in the Parks Bend Farms New Venture Center in August, leasing 10,000 square feet of manufacturing space. Speedex has contracts to sell tractors in Mexico and is pursuing other international business opportunities throughout Europe.
Word has it that Armstrong County may also be the site of a new federal prison. Palilla says that there are sites in the county that could hold the prison, but no plans have been made.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2>How to Select an Advisor </FONT SIZE> <i> By David B. Root Jr.</i><p>
Investing is a full-time job. Given the vast amount of information available for review and the complexity of the task, a part-time effort by an individual investor has little chance of achieving long-term success. That is why individuals who cannot devote substantial time to their own investment activities should seek the full-time commitment of a professional advisor.<P>
However, just as not all doctors are skillful surgeons and not all politicians are brilliant orators, not all professional money managers are financial wizards. If you're looking for a good investment advisor, a lot of people will be glad to recommend one. But it may turn out that all they really know about him is that he's a nice guy -- and has a 6 handicap at golf. In the past, investment managers of multi-million dollar pension funds were all too often selected in the same way. Corporations that carefully reviewed the performance of their executives frequently made little effort to review the performance of the people managing their retirement funds.<P>
How does one go about selecting an advisor? The challenge is understanding precisely what they do, evaluating the validity of their approaches (do they make sense?) and assessing their integrity (do they do what they promised, and is it in your best interest?).<P>
There is no better place to begin one's investigation than with personal ethics. Do the advisors eat home cooking? That is, do they manage their own money in parallel with their clients? I can think of no more important test of an advisor's integrity and the likelihood of success than his or her own confidence in the approach pursued on behalf of clients. It is interesting to note that few bond fund managers or brokers invest their own money in derivatives. In other words, they eat out.<P>
The decision to employ an investment professional should be made only after a thorough analysis of the past performance of the individual or organization under consideration. Some questions are obvious: How long a track record is there? Was it achieved over one or more market cycles? Was it achieved by the same person who will manage your money, and does it represent the complete results achieved during some favorable period? Did this manager invest conservatively in down markets, or did clients lose money? Were the results fairly steady over time, or were they volatile? Is this manager still following the same strategy employed to achieve his or her past success?<P>
Once you've satisfied yourself that the track record is above average -- that it has been consistently better than the market indices -- there are two more questions to ask: What were the factors that went into that record? And what is the probability that those same factors will continue to work?<P>
For individuals who cannot devote substantial time to their own investment activities or do not have the minimums necessary to hire their own money managers (keep in mind that many will work with as little as $100,000), mutual funds offer a viable alternative. Mutual funds are, in theory, an attractive alternative combining professional management, low transaction costs, immediate liquidity and reasonable diversification. In practice, however, they mostly do a mediocre job of managing money. According to Lipper Analytical Services, a leading mutual fund rating service, only 17% of the 426 equity mutual funds in existence over the 10 years ending Dec. 31, 1993, were able to outpace the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Index.<P>
A good mutual fund organization, however, has a built-in advantage: It concentrates its entire effort on a limited number of portfolios which are subject to constant public scrutiny. No mutual fund manager can afford not to devote full attention to them. Portfolios can't get lost in the shuffle or be given simply routine attention. Nor can they be delegated to a trust officer or account executive whose greatest strength is in client relations rather than portfolio management.<P>
Unfortunately, many investors choose their mutual funds the same way they pick horses at the track: They see who has performed well lately and bet on them. It is helpful to recognize that there are cycles of investment fashion; different approaches go into and out of favor, coincident with recent fluctuations in the results obtained by practitioners. If a manager with a good long-term record has a poor recent one, he or she may be specializing in an area that is temporarily out of favor. If so, the returns achieved could regress to their long-term mean as their cycle matures; several poor years could be followed by several strong ones. Obviously, it makes sense to limit your selection of an investment manager to those who are able to demonstrate that they've done consistently better than the averages.<P>
Finally, one of the most important matters for an investor to consider is personal compatibility with an advisor. If rapport is lacking, the relationship will not last. Similarly, if the investor is not comfortable with the investment approach, the choice of managers is a poor one. A conservative investor may not feel comfortable with a professional short-seller, no matter how favorable the results; by contrast, an aggres-sive investor may not be compatible with an advisor who buys securities and holds them.<P>
Once an advisor has been hired, the client must monitor his or her behavior and results on an ongoing basis. Remember, the questions involved in selecting a manager are just as applicable once you've hired one.<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Managing Managed Care<BR>
</B></FONT SIZE><BR>
<I>By Lydia Strohl</I> <BR>
</CENTER>
<P><HR><BR>
Lots of people entering managed care for the first time wonder how their
healthcare will change - but the truth is, if you learn the rules, the quality
of care you get doesn't have to change drastically.<BR>
<BR>
What's most likely to change is the system through which your care is delivered.
Consumers in this new paradigm should take a more active part in managing
their own health - which, truth be told, they should have been doing all
along <BR>
In Part I of Executive Report's series entitled Managing Managed Care, we
examined last month the process of entering a managed care program. In Part
II this month, we look at how consumers can work the system in their own
favor and get the care they need and desire.<BR>
In managed care, the key is to partner with the primary care physician to
manage your healthcare, according to industry insiders. Consumers must learn
how to communicate with the primary care physician<BR>
&quot;Take the initiative to establish a relationship - most plans cover
an initial visit, or require only a small co-pay,&quot; says Tom Chepel
of the state's bureau of healthcare financing. &quot;If you have no contact
with them, then have a problem at 3 a.m. on Sunday and the primary care
physician knows nothing about you, it's very difficult for the  doctor.&quot;<BR>
Experts suggest that consumers chart their own healthcare: 
<UL>
  <LI> 	Keep notes, files and copies of all 	paperwork. 
  <LI>	Before going to the doctor, make a full list of symptoms and any
questions.
  <LI>	Ask for test results and go to other 	sources for information.
  <LI>	If you disagree with the doctor, ask for a second opinion. Or ask
to go 	to a specialist. 
</UL>
<BR>
Be careful, however, to read the fine print in your contract first. If you
get a test or visit a doctor who is not covered, you will probably have
to pay for it yourself. And on this you can't rely on your primary care
physician because every contract is different. Not only is the coverage
each insurer offers different, but they negotiate different benefit packages
for each insured group.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Physicians may not know all the rules either, though they should have
a reasonable knowledge of the plans,&quot; says Marvin Gaynor, a professor
at CMU's Heinz School of Public Policy.  &quot;It's all still pretty new
stuff.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
If you know what the rules are on precertification and authorization for
areas like emergency care and use of a specialist, you're less likely to
have to fight with the HMO for coverage after the fact. <BR>
If you do feel you need a  service that isn't covered, talk with your primary
care physician. Unfortunately, in this new paradigm, doctors spend a lot
of time negotiating with managed care companies for incremental coverage.
<BR>
<BR>
It's also possible for consumers to go to bat for themselves. And there
are ways to win.<BR>
&quot;Few HMOs will refuse to allow patients to seek another option if they
come armed - the bigger problem is that the consumer doesn't get enough
information,&quot; says Sean McLinden, executive director of Duquesne University's
Pittsburgh Health Research Institute. &quot;And they must be persistent.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
When Eric Nickeson left Allegheny General Hospital for Ohio Valley Health
Services and Education two years ago, the family changed managed care plans
- and had to change doctors. That can be hard at the best of times  - but
when there's a kid with a mysterious illness involved (Nickesons' daughter
has an unusual kidney condition), it can border on traumatic. The only pediatric
nephrologists available to monitor his daughter Hannah's illness were at
Children's Hospital, and appointments were a 17-week wait. The Nickesons
weren't satisfied with the wait, or the physicians. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;They were used to seeing very sick kids, and Hannah continued to grow
and develop normally,&quot; says Eric's wife, Ellie Nickeson. &quot;So they
just weren't very interested in her. It seemed to us that there was a power
struggle in the group - every time she went, a different doctor saw her,
and recommended something different.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The Nickesons began to look for other specialists and were referred to a
well-respected pediatric nephrologist named Ben Broohard, affiliated with
the Cleveland Clinic. Despite the fact that the Nickesons' new plan advertised
affiliation with the Cleveland Clinic, the Nickesons' discontent with the
practitioners here wasn't enough for the plan to justify coverage. They
 had to get a doctor's letter saying that the care should be changed; even
then, Hannah was allowed just one con-   sultation. <BR>
Compounding the matter, Hannah needed a bone density scan to see if her
condition was affecting her bones; the highly technical test was not included
in their coverage.  One specialized instrument necessary to do the test
existed in Pittsburgh, and it was only licensed for research. But  the Nickesons
worked the system, and Hannah eventually got the scan, which showed no problems.<BR>
The Nickesons - because they are both employed in the healthcare industry
- did have a network of professionals to turn to. But there is more and
more information available to consumers without that inside track. One is
the library or bookstore: A plethora of consumer health magazines have cropped
up, as well as books on individual conditions. Another is the phonebook:
Agencies exist for many diseases, like diabetes, heart disease and cancer,
and these organizations can lead to many resources. Local and state medical
associations can also be sources. <BR>
<BR>
Information is increasingly being made available in new ways, too. Time
Life recently formed Time Life Medical, which puts out a series of videos
on the top 30 conditions afflicting the American public. They are done in
collaboration with such experts as former surgeon general C. Everett Koop,
and the company says they will be continually updated. Booklets in the packet
have other resources for help, too. Available at drugstores, the videos
cost about $20 each.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Managed care has decreased the time physicians spend with patients,&quot;
says Koop, who was in Pittsburgh in May. &quot;But when people are shocked
in the doctor's office by news they didn't expect, it's not the time for
patient education. If you say, 'That lump is cancerous,' they don't hear
much else. We urge patients to be informed about their problems, so they
can take charge of their health, which is taking charge of their life.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<B>Corporate Connection<BR>
</B><BR>
According to a recent study done by benefits consulting firm Hewitt Associates,
88 percent of over 1,000 major U.S. employers surveyed have introduced some
kind of health management program  - to either promote health, prevent unnecessary
risk or intervene in the early stages of disease. The reason? Good health,
though it's not been statistically proven, results in lower healthcare costs
impacting the bottom line.<BR>
<BR>
The programs they implement range from education and training to health
risk assessments to financial incentives or disincentives (like a penalty
for smokers). Some even give physicals and flu shots, or will subsidize
a fitness program. (See this month's Healthbeat, page 62.)<BR>
<BR>
The Internet also has a wealth of healthcare information on-line, if you
can find it. At West Penn Hospital, for instance, Dr. Robert Selker found
he was getting queries from patients who pulled information off the Internet
about his clinical trials for the treatment of brain cancer. One patient
from Cleveland came to Selker because of information she found on-line.<BR>
<BR>
Selker now exchanges electronic mail with other cancer specialists in London
and Washington, D.C., and discusses treatments via e-mail with patients
as far away as Germany.<BR>
&quot;This is a tremendous tool of empowerment to patients,&quot; Selker
says.<BR>
<BR>
The problem is, as with anything on the Internet, that its value is dependent
on the veracity of the source; anyone can set up info on the Internet. However,
federal agencies, research hospitals, universities and nonprofit groups
do provide good information via this channel.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Recourse<BR>
</B><BR>
Even the best educated consumers may at some time get caught in the managed
care system, but fortunately, there are a number of ways to appeal. Pennsylvania
requires that managed care plans have an approved consumer grievance system
and report these grievances once a year to the state.<BR>
At the most basic level, if your grievance is a general complaint about
a process or doctor, you can call the member service hotline, which will
be listed in the member guide. Most plans also conduct periodic member surveys,
which, during this period of percolating competition, they do look at. <BR>
Managed care is a system that benefits from volume, so they're concerned
with member satisfaction and retention rates and the efficiency of their
systems, because they want to keep members in the plan.<BR>
<BR>
If you have a specific grievance, the managed care company is required to
have a two-step internal grievance process which you can appeal to; if you
are still unsatisfied, the state will consider your case. As a first step,
the plan usually will internally review your case, using an administrative
appeals committee. They will inform you of their decision and your right
to further appeal if they do not decide in your favor.<BR>
<BR>
The next step is an appeal before an appeals committee that consists of
not only plan administrators and board members, but plan members, participating
employers and providers. Parties involved in the grievance can be present.
If that appeal, too, is overturned, the member then has the right to appeal
to the state. <BR>
<BR>
In 1994, there were 1,379 first level grievances among members of Pittsburgh
area HMOs. Of those, 296 grievances were heard at the second level by the
HMO; just 29 were appealed to the state. According to the state, consumers
will continue to appeal if they are not satisfied, so the state assumes
that those who did not appeal further got what they wanted or realized their
case was without merit. Figures for 1995 are not yet complete, but the state
heard 49 appeals from this area. Emergency care coverage was the most frequently
grieved issue.<BR>
<BR>
The bureau of healthcare financing also receives complaint calls: It got
700 in 1995 statewide. The bulk of those have to do with decisions to pay
claims, consider courses of treatment that members desire, approval of referrals
to noncontracted providers and expedition of special review cases. Robert
Achenbach, deputy secretary for quality assurance and health planning in
the Pennsylvania department of insurance's bureau of healthcare financing,
contends that the fact that so few of these ever come to the state's attention
formally is a credit to the HMOs.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The HMOs are bending over backwards to satisfy even borderline cases,&quot;
says Achenbach.<BR>
The moral? If you've got a case, make it known. If you don't like the result,
you can always vote with your feet. You have the right to another doctor,
and, when your re-enrollment period comes around, another provider.<BR>
<BR>
Taking these steps does mean more work for the healthcare consumer. But
in the end, it hopefully will mean better healthcare in the aggregate, as
we move from a fragmented system to one that, with our participation, coordinates
care. The processes are not all smooth yet; but most agree that Pittsburgh
has a good provider community, working primarily in the interest of the
healthcare consumer.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's clear that HMOs cannot be characterized as being wracked by fraud
and abuse,&quot; says CMU's Gaynor. &quot;But on the other hand, it's very
competitive, and there is a lot of pressure on the cost side to keep utilization
and cost down. You do hear about cases, like where the man collapsed at
home, and his wife called the HMO about getting an ambulance - by the time
the ambulance got there, he had died. That's a process problem, but it's
obviously not completely separate if the intent is to control utilization.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The bottom line is profit - if the HMOs can't sustain a profit, they
go out of business. But they can't do that if you provide poor quality care.
That's clearly not good for business.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Gaynor and others put the impetus on employers to drive for quality healthcare.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Most of the concern at present is that the buyers of HMO insurance
are employers. They are concerned with the costs, and HMOs are responding.
But that's beginning to change because people are beginning to realize that
sometimes there is too little quality, and maybe, sometimes, you have to
sacrifice for quality.&quot;<BR>

<b><font size =+1>Actually, Any of a Number of<br>Products Will Do Just Fine</b></font><br>

<HR>
When you're in pain, the last thing you need is to sort through the choices in the pain relief aisle at your local pharmacy. Aspirin and Tylenol, the old standards, have been joined by Advil, Motrin, Nuprin, Orudis KT - all claiming to Vanquish and Aleve pain.<P>It's enough to give you a headache.<P>"What's it all mean?" you cry in exasperation.<P>Just about nothing, really, say the experts.<P>"This is a multibillion dollar industry - everyone has pains of one kind or another," says John Lech, a clinical pharmacy specialist at the Center for Drug Information at Mercy Hospital. <P>"Every company that can possibly get one of these on the market stands to gain," Lech says. "The difference is minimal - it's a marketing thing. I have to swallow when I see how gullible the American public is."<P>In fact, all those shelves full of bottles boil down to just five active ingredients: aspirin, acetaminophen, ibu-profen, naproxin and ketoprofen. But sales in 1994 added up to a $2,617 billion market.<P>Aspirin, or acetyl salicylic acid,  hit the market in 1893 and quickly became the most widely used medication in the world. But the acid-based compound for treating pain and inflammation isn't always good on the stomach.<P>"In the '70s, stress was increasing, so consumption of aspirin was increasing, and with aspirin, side effects were found," says Jim Paone, owner of Wyman's Legend Pharmacy on the North Side. "In fact, people were using more of other types of drugs that aspirin interfered with."<P>Patients taking blood thinners, like commadin, found that aspirin decreased the drug's efficacy. (Although for those taking aspirin to thin the blood, like some patients at risk for heart attacks, there is no substitute.)<P>But the stage was set for the introduction of acetamin-ophen, a compound chemically related to aspirin, but with different side groups, which became available over-the-counter in 1958. But while acetaminophen, a basic compound, was gentler on the stomach than aspirin, it wasn't an anti-inflammatory. Which meant that though fine for headaches, it did little for achy pain, like arthritis.<P>But it was competition.<P>"The aspirin companies came out with their own versions - Anacin 3 is Tylenol," says Paone. "So the marketing wars started."<P>In May 1984, ibuprofen was brought over-the-counter, the first of a group called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs. Ibuprofen is the key ingredient in products such as Advil, Motrin and Nuprin, as well as a variety of generic brands. It combines pain relief and anti-inflammatory properties, and is generally gentler on the stomach than aspirin - making it a popular alternative. Ibuprofen currently rules the OTC analgesic market, capturing $599.5 million  of the total market. <P>Of course, where there's a good idea, there's one better: In January 1994, naproxin, the active ingredient in Aleve, joined the NSAIDs available over-the-counter, and in October 1995 came ketoprofen, active in Orudis KT and Actron. Both are chemical cousins to ibuprofen.<P>The difference is in the dosing. Ketoprofen, the active ingredient in Actron and Orudis KT, takes a smaller dose - 12.5 mg as opposed to the standard 200 mg ibuprofen. Naproxin differs in that it is a long-acting NSAID, whereas ibuprofen is short-acting. That means ibuprofen lasts six to eight hours; naproxin claims to relieve pain for up to 12 hours. <P>"They're me too drugs," says Paone. "The trade-off is, [naproxin] takes longer to kick into the           bloodstream." <P>So to differentiate their products, manufacturers use different fillers, strengths, combinations of ingredients, colors and formulas. Anacin combines aspirin and caffeine, the stimulation from which some feel speeds their relief. <P>Vanquish, another aspirin-based product, combines aspirin, caffeine and acetaminophen, as does Excedrin. Bufferin is aspirin buffered to be gentler on the stomach. They come in brown, yellow, green and white, in gel caps, liquid, caplets or tablets. The fillers can affect their absorption in different people - size, shape and color also affect individual choice.<P>And lately, manufacturers have tried to differentiate themselves by accusing the others of being less than safe. Most recently, those accusations have manifested themselves in claims of dangerous pairing with alcohol. In October 1995, the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a jury's finding that McNeil, manufacturer of Tylenol, "negligently failed to warn consumers of the risk associated with combining therapeutic doses of acetaminophen with alcohol." The man, whose liver was irreversibly damaged by a combination of wine and Extra-Strength Tylenol, received an award of $8 million.<P>"I don't believe the occasional use of alcohol and Tylenol means increased risk - unless you're an alcoholic or have alcoholic hepatitis," says Lech. "But this is not a new finding; there have been reports of this since the '80s. The thing that has to be debated is, are the warnings strong enough?"<P>Potential for overdosing on these drugs does exist, as does the possibility for stomach discomfort or kidney problems. But basically, "It's extraordinarily unusual to get ill if you take as directed. The vast amount of Americans are complacent, and feel that if the drug can be obtained over-the-counter then it is safe," says Dr. Philip Balk, board-certified internist and rheumatologist, and a member of the faculty at Shadyside Hospital. "Ninety-five percent of people can take it without any serious problems, but certain subsets must be careful."<P>Moderate drinkers, those who drink three or more drinks a day, those on other medications like blood thinners and those with ulcers are at risk, albeit small. And they appear to be no less or more at risk no matter which pain reliever they choose.<P>"It's all individual preference, and cost," says Lech. That's a biggie - aspirin can be as little as $1 for a hundred tablets; some of the NSAIDs start at 10 times that.<P> "There is no clear winner from the standpoint of safety or efficacy," Lech says.<P>"I take aspirin."<P>

<FONT SIZE=+>What We Needed Was a <br>Little Stability
</FONT SIZE><br>
<i>By Jim Urban</i>
</CENTER>
<hr>


<P>Executive Report: Why buy a financially troubled team in a market that is losing population?<P>Kevin McClatchy: There are a couple things.  I thought there was a very dedicated base of fans.  Having looked at the Oakland A's and very, briefly, the San Francisco Giants, I felt there were better fans out here.  That's important.<P>Also, there was more of an opportunity, eventually, to get a new stadium in Pittsburgh as opposed to other markets.  Given those two factors, I thought it would be a great opportunity for a turnaround situation.  After our first meeting with the mayor and city, wefelt we could negotiate some form of lease concession package to help us bridge that gap.<P>ER: And you bridged that gap soon after taking control of the team. Please explain what you've done with the budget and where you are now.<P>KM: There are some things -- some we've done, some were luck -- that help us financially.  One was negotiating the lease concession package with the city, which will save us -- minimum in hard costs -- $8 million annually.  That number can go up if our attendance increases.
<P>The new Fox/NBC national television contract has brought us close to  $4 million more annually than we projected in our numbers. So before we threw the first pitch, we were $12 million a year better than when we first took this thing over. <P>Also, last year we drew less than      1 million fans; our goal this year is      1.4 million. Some people think that is aggressive. In reality, it's not when you look at the Pirates' historicals. The fans are there. You just have to get them to the park. I think by putting a better team on the field, we will be able to hit our projected attendance figures. That will bridge that gap even more.<P>There's one other thing, revenue sharing, that is very important to what we are doing here in Pittsburgh.With preliminary approval already, there's reason to be optimistic about it.<P>ER: You mentioned fielding a better team. Can the small-market teams - such as the Pirates - do that? <P>KM:  There were a couple problems when we took over: One, that the fans don't know who the players are; and two, the perception that the Pirates don't keep their players. That's not a complaint unique to Pittsburgh. It's a complaint that has been common throughout baseball, and now sports.<P>We have signed some of our better core players to more than just one-year deals. We'd like to create some stability with the fans and the people they are trying to identify with. We've done quite a bit, to be honest, and it has worked out well. Jeff King is in for two years. We have an option on a second year for Charlie Hayes. Jay Bell and Carlos Garcia are both here for the next two years. Al Martin and Orlando Merced are here for the next two years. <P>We've negotiated a lot of contracts - almost every starter is locked up for another two years. I think people can get used to these players because some of them are pretty good. Garcia was in the all-star game in 1994, Bell has been in the all-star game, and I think Merced and King are very good players. Denny Neagle, who was in the all-star game last year, is a pretty good pitcher. What we needed was some stability, which has not been present among the Pirates the last couple years.<P>Our farm system is in good shape. Sporting News ranked it seventh, behind the Dodgers, Cleveland, the Yankees, Mets ... some very good organizations. We are going to be as committed or more committed to our minor league system. When you are a small market team, you have to be. You develop your players. The key is getting your revenues to a point where you can sign some of those players to long-term contracts. We will continue to put more money into the minor leagues and hopefully grow revenue to the point where we can sign some of the better players instead of being a farm system for the rest of the league. That's one of the real challenges.<P>ER: What do you say to those - and there are many - who think Three Rivers Stadium is just fine?<P>KM: There are a lot of different reasons for a new park. One, it's important for the franchise to remain competitive long-term. People are going away from what they call the cookie-cutter stadiums of the '70s. Baseball is obviously a much different sport than football, where you have 10 home dates a year and the fans tailgate. With baseball, you have 81 home dates a year, which is a lot. People would like to be comfortable when they go out to the stadium. If you look at Cleveland or Camden Yards in Baltimore, you are right on top of the action, it's a comfortable place to watch a game. And the stadiums are downtown where there are other things going on. There are restaurants, bars, hotels, or people go straight from their office to the game.<P>Because of the comfort, they tend to draw a lot of people, which gives them the ability to be more competitive financially with other franchises.<P>Three Rivers Stadium, I think, is not the worst place in the world, but it is not a good baseball park. It is a good place to watch football, and there are some good seats for baseball, but only about 20,000. <P>When we went to get the lease concessions, that was because we had the worst lease in all of baseball. We are a small market team and we had the worst lease in baseball, so it was tough to be competitive. At least now, we are toward the middle of the pack in terms of the lease. Three Rivers did not give us the ability via concessions, via parking, via luxury boxes, to get some of the revenues that most clubs get that make them competitive.<P>ER: You favor a location in downtown or very close. Why?<P>KM: That is another aspect to a new baseball stadium. In Colorado [Coors Field], the area where they put that stadium was kind of run down, and it has been a tremendous boost to the merchants downtown. The same at Jacobs Field in Cleveland and Camden Yards in Baltimore. When you are bringing 35,000 or 40,000 people downtown, and they are spending their money downtown, it helps.<P>Having lived in a hotel room in downtown Pittsburgh for five months as we worked on this deal, I can tell you that downtown Pittsburgh could use a shot in the arm. And I don't mean this as a negative comment. When you get a new facility, you all of a sudden see more restaurants, more activity. That's what baseball is at these new facilities. They are not just games, they are events, and they add a lot to the city.<P>One other aspect: I think if you are a mid-level CEO looking to locate your business to another city and you go to a Cleveland or a Baltimore during the summer, maybe go to a game and there are 40,000 people downtown, a lot of restaurants and bars - this is a quality of life issue that someone looking to relocate a business will consider. I don't think when they go to Three Rivers they will experience that.<P>As far as location is concerned, we  as a team have not really looked at all the different components, at parking, accessibility. I think it should be downtown or very close to downtown.<P>People in Cleveland walk a fair amount. Their offices are maybe not right near the park, but walking 10 or 15 minutes is not a bad thing. You have to make it accessible for walking. <P>I am convinced Pittsburgh needs a new facility and I've stated that since I got here. It's not something I came out with after closing the sale.<P>As far as timing, we need to explore sites and pick one within two years. Other cities have picked sites more quickly, but there's nothing wrong here with taking some time and doing it right. After we pick the site, you are looking at two to three years to build it, so we are probably five years out before we have a new stadium.<P>ER: How do you pay for the stadium without passing most of it on to the residents of the region?<P>KM:  We are going to ask the city to play some role in it, to come up with some piece of the financing. There are different avenues, such as a hotel tax or some other things, that don't actually hit the people who live in the city. On the county side, we want all the counties to be players. The Pirates are a regional team and these outlying counties have plenty of Pirates fans in them. <P>The current county commissioners in Allegheny County have their program and want to stick with it. We will sit down with them and show them how this has been done in other markets. For example, in Phoenix, they have an airport tax. Every time you fly into the Phoenix airport, you help pay for their stadium. There is no reason why we can't do something similar in Pittsburgh.<P>The final piece of this is the state, and we've had some good conversations with Gov. Ridge. He understands the importance of a new facility to western Pennsylvania. What we are talking about is a public-private partnership, the city, county, state and us. <P>ER: Once the deal was done, you jumped into a marketing and advertising campaign. What did you learn from looking at the Pirates' recent history and how did that influence what you are doing now?<P>KM: It's tough because the Pirates have gone in waves. They didn't need to market when they had Barry Bonds, Andy Van Slyke, Bob Bonilla and Doug Drabek. They could put the players out there and get away without marketing. I think they could have possibly done a better job marketing some of those players when they were here. Once those players were gone and the team was stripped, then came the strike. I don't know if there was much the team could have done. Spending $2 million advertising probably would not have made a difference.<P>We feel now we have to take a very proactive stance with marketing. We'd like to market our players, let the public know who our players are. With our television campaign, with some of the key players in these commercials, people get to see their personality.<P>Another thing is to get out as much as we can and listen to what the fans are telling us. We recently took an ad out in newspapers that was a fan survey. We got 1,000 responses, which means 1,000 people took time to clip it out, write on it and send it back to us. There were a lot of good ideas, it gave people the chance to tell us their feelings about the Pirates. We are getting out to talk to as many groups as possible. You call it grass roots marketing. <P>One thing that is sometimes missing in sports is a link between the ownership and the fans. If you pull yourself away from all the glamour of sports, it still is a business. And there is nothing wrong with the person who runs a business, whether it be a corner deli or Major League Baseball team, getting out and talking to customers. I've done that, and I think there has been a positive reaction. It's a different type of marketing. It has bridged the gap and created renewed interest in the Pirates.<P>ER: How soon can you expect to turn the team around financially? <P>KM:  As far as ticket sales, [in early March] we were up 80,000 to 100,000 in ticket sales, which was pretty good. We hadn't even started our advertising campaign. We had just taken over the team. This was done without our media program.<P>I think if I do my job  - I'm making a commitment to the fans, and I need them to make a commitment to me, and I think if we both do our jobs, we can make this thing work. <P>This is a team that has been knocked around the last few years. If this franchise received the lease concessions we received six or seven years ago, you would not have the debt you have now. I don't think this franchise has been going in its best direction. What I want to do is give this thing a real shot, and I don't necessarily think that's been done.<P>I think we'll lose money this season, but I think we can turn around and break even in two years.<P>ER: What kind of CEO will you be?<P>KM:  I am going to be very hands-on, probably much more hands-on than people are used to with the Pittsburgh Pirates. The previous ownership did not have an office at the stadium, which I already have. I think it's important. I think the people of Pittsburgh appreciate knowing who the owner is. That's one of the reasons I get out and meet people. It's a lot of work, but a lot of fun.<P>ER: Has your age of 33 years helped or hurt you in this process?<P>KM: When we first got into this, we weren't the only ones. I think some people looked at me and said 'That guy, we don't need to worry about him.' I think some people discounted our ability to do this deal.<P>Overall, the age thing was a plus. It helped slightly in the negotiation process in competing with other people, but I think it was somewhat of a negative in that people would ask for or try to get away with more than they should have.<P>The age thing helps in other ways. I haven't been the CEO of a Fortune 500 company. If I had been, maybe I wouldn't want to go to a mall and be with fans. So it's helped that way. I think it also has helped attract younger fans, generate some excitement. Even people in college think, 'This guy is not much older than me.' The older fans think my age is refreshing. They think I look like their son-in-law. The fans are a key to what we are trying to accomplish.<P>ER: How much of your investment is your own money?<P>KM: All the money that's on my side is my own money. I have one other investor that's a family member, Brown Maloney, a cousin. He came in as a limited partner. But all the money that's in there, none of it's from our company, none of it's from my family, it's all my money. There's no big Fortune 500 company backing me on this one.<P>ER: What do you think you have to learn in this business?<P>KM: My educational curve will probably come with the politics of baseball as far as the workings of the Major League folks. The game itself, I know very well. But I know enough  to let Cam [Bonifay] and Jim [Leyland] make decisions. They'll come to me with recommendations and I'll try and support them most of the time.<P>I think I surprised a lot of people when I talk to them about certain players, because they think, 'Wow this guy really knows his stuff.' But I know if you're close enough to sports you know what you do know and you don't know. I know people's batting averages, how they played and where they've played, but the guys that are really involved in baseball, they really know so much more than sports fans. And you've got to let the baseball people do their thing. <P>What I hope to bring to the  party is marketing, those kinds of things. The combination of the two should make a good team. The Pirates organization has some good people, but they've had their challenges. It's been tough working in this environment where they're constantly taking your budgets down, then the strike. People's hands have been tied, so we're going to have some fun with it, let people run with it.<P>We're going to evaluate everything. We took over with a month to opening day. Now is not a good time to make changes. I don't believe in change just to make change. You make mistakes.<P>ER: When will you be able to go after the better free agents?<P>KM: I think, especially with revenue sharing, we'll be more competitive to bid on some of those folks next year. It's important to understand that spending does not necessarily equate to winning in baseball. The Baltimore Orioles spent close to $50 million last year and had a losing record. The Yankees made the playoffs last year but prior to that it was 1981 since they had made the playoffs, and they outspent a lot of people. I think you can grow your minor league system, and then have enough money to sign some of those players and keep them in your system. A team that I grew up not liking very much but I had to give them hats off, is the Dodgers. They've done a good job growing talent and then keeping it. Cleveland: If you ever want to draw a parallel to what I think Pittsburgh can do, just go two hours down the road. They built a new stadium, and as their revenues grew they signed more players to longer term contracts. It was a relationship that went hand in hand. I think we can do that here. We've already started to sign some of our players to longer contracts. We're going to continue to grow our minor league farm system, and as attendance grows and revenue grows, we're going to be more competitive.<P>The year before any of these teams moved into new ballparks you'd see a million jump in attendance because the fans wanted to get the first right of refusal in the new ballpark. A million jump, that's dramatic to your bottom line and gives you the ability to go out and sign free agents at a pretty decent pace. But we are a small market, and we need to spend wisely.<P>ER: What about personal seat licenses?<P>KM: You could possibly do it on a limited basis here, but not full scale.<P>ER: Do you like Pittsburgh?<P>KM: It's just unbelievable how nice people have been wherever I go. They're genuinely warm people. I think it has some challenges. You need to get some younger folks, mid-level corporations. Right now, I'm trying to stay focused on what's immediately ahead of us, but down the road I will get involved.<P>

<font size=+1>Pennsylvania is Trying to Be Business Friendly,<br>But Many Businesses Still Say They Would Leave                 

</font><BR>
<i>By Jim Strader

<HR>
In the rough-and-tumble of Harrisburg politics, you have to know the players to stay in the game. The state's business community has a team on the field in the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry, but it's a team that's staring at some daunting numbers.<P>The chamber keeps track of the active issues in the statehouse and works to advance the interests of industry. Lobbyists push the business agenda in Capitol corridors, through the mail, with analyses of specific pending legislation and by briefing chamber members to help them make their own case to local lawmakers.<P>The chamber is lauding some of the business friendly measures included in Gov. Ridge's first budget, but sees a bigger problem needing the attention of state government. Fred Sembach, the chamber's top lobbyist, cites a recurring question asked of business in an annual survey: "If you could leave Pennsylvania, would you?"<P>In 1993, the question drew an affirmative answer - companies would leave the state if able - from 58 percent of those who responded. In 1994, the percentage peaked slightly, to 58.7 percent. In the April 1995 survey, taken a couple of months after the Ridge administration began its work, the number of those who said they would leave had dropped to 43 percent.<P>"That's a step in the right direction, but 43 percent is still too high," Sembach says.<P>Reasons companies want to leave center on the business climate -  how they are treated when a problem needs government attention -business taxes, workers' compensation and healthcare matters.<P>The chamber sees the response to this one question as a key indication that the business community continues to have problems in Pennsylvania. Addressing it dominates the work of Sembach and other chamber lobbyists, who represent 4,600 members from across the state - almost half of the private sector work force. Though membership takes in all of the state's Fortune 500 businesses, 80 percent of member companies have fewer than 100 employees.<P>The chamber develops positions through direct contact with companies. The organization also counts on a nonscientific monthly survey to generate feedback, Sembach says. The annual scientific survey that generated the 43 percent figure also goes into the mix.<P>Despite Sembach's concern, he concedes that the chamber's work has seen big change owing to the Republican control of the General Assembly and the governor's office. Despite the good working relationship the chamber has had with the statehouse in the past year, Sembach was reluctant to attribute too much to   partisanship. <P>"We don't look at party. We look at those who are ready, willing and able to work with us," he says. "The key thing in '95 has been a better appreciation and more of an inclination to solve business's problems."<P>In the past eight years, with the Democratic administration of Gov. Robert P. Casey in power, the chamber found itself facing an agenda from state government that was "essentially aimed at making business pick up various costs," Sembach says. "We were finding a lot of mandates, things business would be expected to do. Now we're looking at solving the problems of business, not creating new ones.<P>"We've seen a markedly different attitude," he adds. "Many of the things that have been accomplished in '95 have been done on a bipartisan basis."<P>The chamber and the business community at large are heralding reductions in business taxes of more than $220 million, as well as reform in regulatory and workplace issues. The tax cuts were seen by chamber members as a good opening measure in what they hope will be a continued lowering of business taxes. Regulatory relief centers on the former Department of Environmental Re-sources, which saw its focus narrow to regulatory matters as its parks and forests bureaus were spun off to a new agency. In addition, new laws were passed to provide incentives for the cleanup and reuse of abandoned and polluted industrial sites. <P>In the workplace, Sembach says, a new law defining hearing loss was a step in the right direction toward continued reform of workers' compensation, which is leading the list of chamber priorities in the coming year.<P>If workers' compensation reform goes through without being ravaged by special interests, it's likely that 43 percent disapproval figure will drop some more by next year.<P>

      <H2>Down In The Gutter</H2>
    </CENTER>
    <P><STRONG>Just when one thought that the Tories could stoop no lower, along comes their assault on refugees, possibly the most defenceless group of people over whom they have control.</STRONG></P>
    <P>At the time of writing, regulations were due in force in early January which will turn up to 10,000 destitute people onto the streets for no reason other to win Peter Lilley a cheap round of applause from the baying racist end of his party's conference. Under his proposals, asylum seekers who have had their applications to remain rejected will have no entitlement to benefits while they pursue their legal right to appeal.</P>
    <P>And those who apply for asylum after arrival in the UK, perhaps students or visitors stranded here after some political upheaval in their own country, will get no benefits at all.</P>
    <P>What this means in human terms is that people facing persecution at home will be left penniless in the UK, dependent on the goodwill and resources of charities which themselves cannot absorb this burden on top of their normal work.</P>
    <P>Though the numbers involved are enough to overwhelm charities, they are tiny as a proportion of the UK population. The money saved by refusing them housing and other benefits is trivial as a proportion of government spending.</P>
    <P>Even with this government the motive for this callousness cannot be wholly financial.</P>
    <P>And sure enough, it is not. The Tories now scarcely bother to hide their belief that being 'tough on blacks' is a vote-winner, and that the spectacle of men, women and children with the wrong colour skins being deported to 'safe' countries like Nigeria will help them win back the allegiance of disillusioned Thatcherites.</P>
    <P>If asylum seekers end up forced to beg and sleep in the streets, Tory campaign strategists will be delighted to play the law and order card in depicting them as a problem to be dealt with by more repression.</P>
    <P>If a few of these unfortunates end up being jailed, tortured or killed as a result of deportation, it will not worry the Tories either, particularly as it is quite likely to emerge that the UK has a thriving arms trade with the regime concerned.</P>
    <P>The proposed requirement to oblige employers to check up on illegal immigrants has succeeded in outraging even the CBI, normally a friend of the government, for imposing on employers an aspect of law enforcement they cannot reasonably take on. It is likely to tip the balance further against ethnic minority job applicants, even those born in the UK.</P>
    <P>But the Tories have a further motive beyond striking postures against ethnic minorities in particular, and foreigners in general, to impress their more neanderthal supporters. They want to force Labour either to annoy many  of its supporters by acquiescing in these measures, or allow itself to be portrayed as 'soft on blacks' by opposing them.</P>
    <P>True to form, the Blairite Labour party has so far squirmed and evaded, no doubt secretly hoping that the Tories do enact these measures, so saving a future Labour government the aggravation of having to do so itself.</P>
    <P>The UK has had a proud record of giving refuge to victims of persecution including, ironically, the parents of the home secretary Michael Howard, whose record on the asylum issue is worse even than Lilley's.</P>
    <P>The only major party now prepared to defend that record is the Liberal Democrats. This follows a tradition which encompasses the old Liberal Party's stand in 1972 as the only major party willing to welcome expelled Ugandan Asians to the UK.</P>
    <P>There will no doubt be some floating voters who desert the Liberal Democrats because of this. But the party's stand, while principled, is not without its positive electoral consequences too.</P>
    <P>The issue of asylum seekers' rights is symptomatic of the way the political scene has changed in the past year. With every attempt to put 'clear blue water' between themselves and Labour on social issues, the Tories simply find Labour moving closer to them.</P>
    <P>It is clear now that Labour's strategy is based on the premise that traditional Labour voters will vote Labour because they have nowhere else to go, and can consequently be taken for granted as the party moves to the right in the fond hope that it will add floating voters to its original base. This in turn forces the Tories to follow the logic of their strategy into yet further right-wing extremism.</P>
    <P>There is no middle ground here that the Liberal Democrats should inhabit even if they could. But there is a chasm opening up in the areas vacated by Labour into which the Liberal Democrats might move, and their willingness to oppose tax cuts is a sign that they have grasped this.</P>
    <P>But what Labour is now abandoning as fast as possible is not 'the left', in the sense of old Labour statism. That is probably dead beyond recall. It is the things which at times gave a tinge of liberal decency to old Labour, whatever its other faults. And the Liberal Democrats can take advantage of this only by being consistent and unafraid about drawing on their Liberal heritage.</P>

      <H2>Food For Thought At Hornbeam</H2>
    </CENTER>
    <P><B><I>One former Young Liberal's attempts to think globally and act locally is attracting a number of awards. Liz Wood tells the story so far.</I></B></P>
    <HR WIDTH=50%>
    <P><B>If you live in the town, where can you go to enjoy a decent meal</B> and find out about environmental issues at the same time? The answer is Gannets, the award winning cafe at Hornbeam Environmental Centre in Hoe Street, Walthamstow. Gannets is a vegetarian and whole food cafe which was the brain child of former Young Liberal, Joanna Lewis and her friend, Diane Sizer. It has been running for just over a year, and during that time has established a reputation for delicious vegetarian food and the centre has won several awards. In October, on the day that the alcohol licence was obtained, Hornbeam won the Big Issue Award for the Environment out of over 4,000 nominations; just before its first anniversary this month, the centre won an award from the BURA Charitable Trust for 'Best Practice in the Community'; and it has been strongly recommended by several newspapers.
    <P>Joanna Lewis was born in the Essex countryside, but when, after graduation she found herself joining the throng of London's jobless, she determined to do something about it. After a number of jobs she found herself in a vegetarian cafe in Walthamstow. This was an ideal meeting ground for many members of the local environmental forum. When the cafe closed Joanna became more determined than ever to do something positive to help the environment rather than simply being a vegetarian and using recycled loo paper. She felt that the people of Waltham Forest needed a centre where they could meet over a cup of tea, receive information and discuss environmental matters; more than that a centre which would become the disseminator of such information and the instigator of action, a place where informed advice could be sought and found. Moreover, it would provide jobs for some of the unemployed. In order to become self financing, the environmental centre would need some means of generating income. Diane, a young chef, also a member of Waltham Forest's Environmental forum and also now jobless, had often dreamed of running her own cafe. They decided to work together to create Hornbeam Environmental Forum and Gannet's Cafe.
    <P>One of the first steps was to approach the local council to see if they would be interested in the project. The present Tory government, in spite of its splutters about pollution, has not been renowned for its support of environmental projects. However, John Major did send representatives to the Rio Earth summit in 1992. Among other things Agenda 21 of the Summit meeting required local authorities to draw up an agenda to develop strategies for local sustainable development, ways in which they would meet people's needs and improve the quality of their lives without damaging the environment. The conference summary stressed the need for everybody in a local community to help determine the sort of environment they should have, and to work together to achieve it. The aim of Hombeam was to provide a focus for exactly this kind of activity, so through supporting projects like Hornbeam, the council could partially fulfil their obligations under Agenda 21.
    <P>Next, having enlisted the interest of Waltham Forest Council they looked for a suitable building. Now one such already existed in Hoe Street near the Baker's Arms, part of it being in use as a community recycling project. The building, which belonged to Waltham Forest Council, was in a very dilapidated state and would need gutting and refurbishing throughout. As neither Joanna nor Diane had any money they drew up a business plan and began trawling various organisations with a view to raising the necessary capital. A committee was set up to manage the centre and, when they were finally ready, local volunteers were recruited, including many jobless. All the building work was done by volunteers, over 100 of them, aged from 4 - 74, able bodied and disabled, skilled and unskilled; only the roof which needed re-slating was left to professionals. On one occasion a painter passed down the street and berated the girl who was painting the front, saying, 'It's people like you who put me out of work.' This was, of course, untrue, for there was no money available to pay the workers.
    <P>The conversion was carried out as far as possible according to green principals: no hardwoods of any kind; Warmcel Insulation, which is made from recycled newspaper and is pleasant to handle, was used in the loft; and Auro, an organic paint was used. Wherever they could, materials were carefully stripped out and used again; they scoured the district searching for second hand and discarded items which could be reclaimed; even the nails were recycled.
    <P>The building thus demonstrates in practical terms the green ethos of its founder members, even though this process was inevitably much slower than starting with new components. Projects in the near future include the installation of a solar panel and a wind generator: these will provide electricity for Hornbeam and enable the public to see them in action at the same time.
    <P>After two years later, the centre was ready for the grand opening: actually the schedule was so tight that the volunteers were still cleaning the paint off their hands, and the china for the cafe was being unpacked and washed as the mayor and local dignitaries gathered on the pavement outside!
    <P>Hornbeam achieved its first birthday on April 23rd. It is a community led project and the success of Ganet's cafe is essential to generate income for its continuation. For this reason, efforts have been concentrated so far on the cafe but much has already been done to achieve its environmental brief. Meeting rooms are available for local pressure groups, pictures by local artists are always on display, information is disseminated through leaflets and posters, there is a small environmental library (currently awaiting awaiting relocation), talks and presentations take place, environmental workshops and play schemes are initiated. Fair trade items, which return the profits largely to the makers, are on sale and items from local crafts people also have a retail centre is still mainly run by unpaid volunteers although it is hoped eventually to employ more paid staff.
    <P>During its first year the cafe has established a reputation for fine food, showing that vegetarianism need not be a form of penitential masochism. Hornbeam has already won high acclaim and is currently one o f ten finalists for this year's BT-WWF award.
    <P>Waltham Forest has been the centre of protest for many years. It contains not only the controversial M11 trunk route, still the focus of impassioned demonstrations by local people frustrated by the government in their attempts to save their homes and trees from the road builder's bulldozers, but also the ancient woodlands of Epping Forest and the William Morris Gallery, home of that great Victorian champion of the environment. Just as William Morris campaigned to save the forest's hornbeams from the developer's axe, so his spiritual descendants at Hornbeam work today to try to restore the last vestiges of the natural environment in the area and ensure that their children's children will still have some fresh air to breath amongst the trees in the forest.
    <P><I>Hornbeam, at 458, Hoe Street Walthamstow, is a non profit making venture and depends largely for its financing on its cafe, Gannets . The cafe is open from 10-4 on Tuesdays and Wednesdays and from 10 - 10 pm on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. Booking is advisable as accommodation is limited. Tel: 0181 558 6880</I></P>

      <H2>Tower Hamlets - Labour's Shame</H2>
    </CENTER>
    <P><B><I>Dan Falchikov, political adviser to the Lib Dem group reports on Labour's shambles as it destroys decentralisation.</I></B></P>
    <HR WIDTH=50%>
    <P><B>May 1994 saw Labour win a landslide in Tower Hamlets</B>, winning 43 of the 50 seats. Labour saw it as a jewel in their crown and a number of leading Liberal Democrats were, frankly, glad to see the back of the only inner-city Borough that the party controlled. Many of those Liberal Democrats continue to think that the party may be better off without Tower Hamlets, but the people of Tower Hamlets certainly aren't better off without the party. This is the story of Labour's first year back in office.</P>
    <P>One of Labour's first acts, after their election, was to give the Mayor a 28,000 a year allowance and award themselves mobile phones and extra allowances. This was obviously the only thing that they could agree on as they immediately split over a far left challenge to the Leadership. The "moderates" holding on by just 3 votes.</P>
    <P>Labour set about destroying every vestige of eight years of Liberal administration, regardless of cost or efficiency. Neighbourhoods were abolished and central directorates were created. This immediately caused a financial crisis as Labour forgot to appoint finance officers to monitor budgets! Labour set about closing anything that was local, estate offices, employment centres and one stop shops were all threatened with closure.</P>
    <P>Labour received rap over the knuckles in November 1994 when the District Auditor found that they had illegally paid special responsibility allowances to 12 Vice-Chairs. Staff morale fell as confusion reigned over restructuring, with over 300 requests for voluntary redundancy since May. Over 700,000 was paid to those taking redundancy or early retirement in the first 6 months of Labour rule. Staff sickness soared, adding 2 million to the wage bill.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of November a damning report went to committee saying that recentralisation could lead to "increased bureaucracy, reduced access a loss of morale and a reduction in front line services." Undaunted Labour pressed on. The cost of Labour's new bureaucracy was now becoming apparent. Demand for photocopying committee agendas soared from 8 million copies a year to 17 million. To cope Labour spent 200,000 on a new photocopier!</P>
    <P>In December Labour announced that they would not consult residents on their budget, unlike the Liberals who had held a referendum in the previous two years. In the new year figures were released showing that the number of empty Council properties rose as managers struggled with recentralisation. The use of bed and breakfast also rose as well as homelessness. The Liberal Democrat administration had reduced homelessness from over 1,600 families to just 600 in two years, under Labour 20 more families per quarter were counted as homeless, despite voids increasing.</P>
    <P>Also in January, Labour announces plans to reduce discretionary awards for students staying on at school. Labour announce that a further 1 million is needed for office accommodation due to restructuring. Labour reduce the number of ethnic minority Councillors on a key Committee. Liberal Democrat Leader, Janet Ludlow, challenges the decision and forces Labour to think again.</P>
    <P>Labour announce as part of the delayed budget process that Council tenants would have to pay a compulsory 10p a week levy to pay for tenants associations. Tenants representatives are up in arms calling it a new poll tax.</P>
    <P>Two major events are announced - Gay Pride will take place in Victoria Park in July and Blur will play in Mile End Park in June. Local people affected by both events were not consulted about the use of these parks. Attempts to query any arrangements by Liberal Democrat Councillors are met with calls of "homophobic".</P>
    <P>February sees the third highest rent rises in London announced. 3 million of tenants money go to purchase new office accommodation for the newly recentralised Housing Department. This works out at an average of 3.30 a week for each of the Borough's 35,000 council tenants. The budget process see Labour target cuts on the elderly, with day centres being axed, cuts to lunch clubs, telephone help service, holiday vouchers, care wardens and a range of charges being increased. Age Concern's funding is halved. On Valentines Day, schools students receive a boost when plans for cutting their grants are declared illegal.</P>
    <P>Labour now turns its fire on housing with a massive closure of local offices and one stop shops. Rent and benefit payments will in future be available at just four offices across the Borough. The amount saved by the closures is exactly the same as the amount set aside by the Housing dept to pay for redundancy as part of the restructuring. March sees budget Council when the full effects of centralisation become apparent.</P>
    <P>The cost of administration has risen by 6.3 million a year. 8.3 million of balances have been blown on restructuring. Combined with an extra 3 million in housing the grand total comes to 17.6 million.</P>
    <P>By cutting bureaucracy to 1994/95 levels Lib Dem budget proposes 2 million extra for education, 1 million extra for social services, 1.4 million to save the one stop shops and estate based offices as well as a 25 a year reduction in Council Tax.</P>
    <P>Also in March Labour decline to back Diana Maddock's all party "warmer homes bill". Tenants face increase repair charges in spite of 18% increase in rents. In April the Council's new found political correctness takes a bizarre twist. Two play groups in Bethnal Green apply for funding. A Bengali, Muslim only, play group receives 14,000, but a Christian one, which is open to all faiths is turned down for a grant of 1,700 on the grounds that it is a "religious based organisation" and it would be anti equal opportunities to fund it.</P>
    <P>Redundancy costs soar. Having all ready put aside 2 million, officers come back with a request for a further 1 million as staff leave the sinking ship that Tower Hamlets has become. Liberal leader Janet Ludlow, comments "Under the Liberal Democrats the Council paid people to deliver services. Under Labour the council pays people to do nothing and then sacks them!".</P>
    <P>Labour's splits become increasingly bizarre with a Councillor suspended for "faking" a fax accusing the leader of racism. May sees new contracts for street cleaning introduced with parts of the Borough seeing the frequency of cleaning halved. Labour's first Mayor in eight years ends his office in ignominy. He covers up his spending, amidst rumours of overspending his not insubstantial 28,000 a year budget and he fails to deliver his promise to lead a campaign against racism. Liberal Democrats call the special Council meeting he failed to do.</P>
    <P>The hard left finally win the internal battle for Labour leadership, with a new leader being elected after a series of Labour Group meetings, one of which ended in the votes being tied. The new leader continues as the old one left off by announcing that the Council is to spend thousands replacing all the street and estate signs with a new green and blue logo, that will have the partially sighted up in arms.</P>
    <P>In the summer of 1995 three separate, but similar, scandals come to light. The former chief executive of Stepney Neighbourhood has been paid to do nothing since the previous May at a cost of 95,000 to local taxpayers. The Director of Social Services is seconded to Birmingham University for two years, taking her conveniently to early retirement - cost 60,000 and a local head teacher will continued to be paid by the council for 18 months for the duration of her NUT presidency - cost 52,000.</P>
    <P>In the Autumn, desperate for more office accommodation, the council plans to spend 0.5 million bringing back into use empty offices, the Liberals had planned to sell off. The Council sets up a Complaints Hotline to deal the ever increasing number of complaints. Unfortunately it is based in Berkshire, much to the delight of the local paper's headline writers! Tower Hamlets hits the national papers when a former Labour Councillor, who happens to be the husband of the Planning Chair, has his rent arrears written off in mysterious circumstances. The officer concerned is disciplined, but the debt remains outstanding.</P>
    <P>In November of this year Labour Councillors and senior officers meet at a 4-star hotel in Essex (at a cost of 7,000) to discuss a paper by the Chief Executive. The paper is damning in its criticism of how the council is now being run. The Chief Exec claims "staff are often demotivated and frightened..     there exists a culture of blame - always blame someone else for failure..... Departmentalism is rife. There is little or no sense of working together as an organisation..       .staff are not encouraged to find solutions that might involve colleagues from other directorates...       Some of the basics of Council workings are not in place - far too much is going on at committee, creating excessive amounts of paper...."</P>
    <P>During this period Tower Hamlets Liberal Democrats have also had to find the resources to fight four by-elections. All have been lost to Labour, despite their record in running the Council. Labour have a formidable by-election machine, pulling in help from across the country and managing to get out to vote all those who supported them in May 1994. Liberal Democrats are left with the same dozen local activists and little or no outside help. The most recent by-election, Limehouse, however showed two signs of hope for the future. Firstly Labour's vote fell by about a hundred from its May 1994 high. Secondly, the BNP, who had been polling 15-20 per cent slumped to just 147, beating the Tories by less than a hundred. Tower Hamlets is clearly once again a two party fight. The Liberal Democrats having had a bad two years are now clearly set to benefit when Labour's slump comes.</P>
    <P>It's been 19 months since Labour had their Tower Hamlets landslide. What I have outlined is just some of the more bizarre/ idiotic/ incompetent/ dogmatic/ loony (delete as appropriate) decisions in those months. I hope that those party members who last year thought we well shot of Tower Hamlets, now realise what Labour rule really means. It provides a salutary lesson for anyone foolish enough to wish for a Labour victory.</P>

      <H2>Bypass Surgery</H2>
    </CENTER>
    <P><STRONG>The Battle of the Newbury Bypass has brought two Liberal principles into head-on collision. For the Liberal Democrats, it is an extreme example of what can happen when local party members who have won control of their council follow a policy which annoys and embarrasses many supporters elsewhere.</STRONG></P>
    <P>This sort of thing is likely to happen with increasing frequency as the number of councils under the party's control rises.</P>
    <P>But both sides at Newbury can cite impeccable justifications in Liberal principles for their stance.</P>
    <P>The council, and Newbury's MP David Rendel, can argue that local public opinion, which they are elected to represent, is substantially in favour of the bypass. Those who believe in devolution of decision making must surely respect this. Who, after all, is better equipped to judge whether Newbury needs a bypass or not than its inhabitants and their elected representatives?</P>
    <P>Those Liberals who treat the devolution of power to 'communities' as the greatest good in politics would have to leave the argument there. The local community, as far as anyone can reasonably tell, wants a bypass. Local opinion somewhere else, for equally valid reasons, might not want a local bypass. There is no conflict between these positions; each can be judged on different local needs. So should a good Liberal respect this and cheer the bulldozers?</P>
    <P>This comes up against the other Liberal principle of sustainability. This is a modern buzzword for an old idea; that the earth's resources should not be heedlessly consumed but reasonably safeguarded for the future.</P>
    <P>Two policies in which this principle finds expression are support for public transport over the private car, and support for increased use of rail rather than increased construction of new roads.</P>
    <P>The idea that improved roads in themselves increase traffic, rather than simply easing the flow of traffic which already exists, was once supported only by an environmentalist green fringe. It is now so mainstream that it half-heartedly informs even the present Government's planning policy.</P>
    <P>Viewed solely from this perspective, the Newbury bypass is an abomination. It destroys protected countryside, and by clearing a bottleneck, makes the A34 corridor more attractive to heavy traffic, ensuring that the problem it seeks to solve will recur at some future time.</P>
    <P>This clash of principles puts Liberals in general, and the Liberal Democrats in particular, in a bind.</P>
    <P>In most of the country, party activists campaign against projects such as this, whether from environmental conviction or nimbyist opportunism.</P>
    <P>Paddy Ashdown's Glasgow conference speech went out of its way to stress adherence to 'green' ideas. And there are plenty of members of his party, and sympathisers beyond, for whom green issues are the most important in politics. The Liberal Democrats, and the Liberals before them, are generally recognised as the 'greenest' mainstream party, particularly after events showed up the Green Party as a frivolous shambles.</P>
    <P>But now Newbury's stance on the most high-profile current environmental issue threatens to put the party on the 'wrong' side of the debate on protecting the environment. Opponents will argue that a party which supports the concreting of part of Berkshire, cannot be trusted to oppose road building anywhere else.</P>
    <P>What will be done? It is a safe bet that with a parliamentary seat at stake, the Newbury local party will not be destroyed from on high, as was Tower Hamlets when the leadership last felt embarrassed by local activity.</P>
    <P>No other part of the Liberal Democrats can compel Newbury to drop its support for the bypass without trampling on local decision-making, one of the party's other key planks.</P>
    <P>In philosophical terms, there is always going to be tension when Liberals devolve power and then feel that those to whom it is devolved are using it for what those above them consider illiberal ends.</P>
    <P>In practical political terms, the best that can be done is to point up the difference between general national policy and particular local cases.</P>
    <P>The party leadership owes it to local members in Newbury not to charge in feet - first to force them to either be quiet or change their minds.</P>
    <P>And Newbury members owe it to their colleagues elsewhere to stress that they support the bypass as a one-off response to an especially acute local pollution problem, and that in general and in other circumstances, they do support sustainability and a commitment to reducing road traffic and road building.</P>
    <P>There is an obvious line of attack on the Government, which has cancelled road building for financial reasons, and far from improving public transport, is simultaneously destroying that for the same motive.</P>
    <P>And the very recognition of local factors opens up an obvious difference between Liberals and the more fundamentalist type of anti-road protester. The latter are creating a climate in which it will become impossible to build any infrastructure, whatever the local circumstances or importance to a national network, without massive protests. It will be interesting to see their response if and when a different future government starts to build new railways across the countryside.</P>

      <H2>Wear the Shoes, Eat the Bacon Sandwich</H2>
    </CENTER>
    <P><B><I>Vegetarianism is becoming an increasingly popular option in the Anglo-Saxon world. Simon Titley questions the assumptions behind the rejection of meat and asks whether vegetarians are entitled to the moral high ground.</I></B></P>
    <HR WIDTH=50%>
    <P><B>Close your eyes and imagine</B> a bacon sandwich. Imagine the smell of the bacon as it cooks in the pan. Imagine the bread (white sliced, of course), moist with bacon fat. Imagine the unmistakable salty, meaty taste as you take your first bite. Salivating? Don't worry, you're in good company.</P>
    <P>Roughly 90% of us enjoy eating dead animals. And why not? We are naturally carnivorous creatures and meat has formed part of the human diet ever since Homo Sapiens climbed down from the trees.</P>
    <P>Yet attitudes to the consumption of animal flesh are being challenged. Symbolic of the zeitgeist was the news that pork consumption in the USA fell by 20% following the screening of the new movie Babe (which features a talking piglet).</P>
    <P>Animal welfare is perhaps the most persuasive argument deployed by vegetarians against the consumption of animals. When I drafted the Liberal Democrat green paper on animal welfare in 1992, however, it struck me that the crucial issue was not whether we kill animals for food but how we treat them while they are still alive.</P>
    <P>The greatest scandal in terms of British animal welfare occurs in the poultry industry, where millions of chickens and turkeys are kept in appalling conditions to supply a demand for cheap meat and eggs. But are the protesters out picketing turkey factories? Are they highlighting the issue of battery-produced eggs? No, they're more concerned about the morality of eating veal or the fate of seal cubs.</P>
    <P>Veal calves and seal cubs, with their pathetic doe eyes, appeal more easily to public sympathy, and are thus more effective as fund-raising and publicity-generating devices. I hate to say this, but the number of veal calves packed in crates is a tiny fraction of the number of chickens suffering in factory farms. But then chickens aren't very cuddly, are they? Apparently few people care about miserable, diseased chickens, no matter how great the industrial scale of the suffering.</P>
    <P>And this reveals the main weakness in the central plank of vegetarianism. By emphasising the morality of whether or not we should kill animals, rather than how we treat animals while they are alive, vegetarians serve an anthropomorphic agenda, a Walt Disney view which grades the worth of animals according to how cuddly they are.</P>
    <P>I happen to care about how we husband our livestock. Quite apart from welfare considerations, when animals have been properly cared for, their meat tastes better. I refuse to buy cheap frozen chicken or turkey because I am aware of the cruelty that goes into the production of this food. But I also refuse to buy it because it tastes inferior. When I  want to roast a chicken, I buy a free-range, corn-fed bird, partly for moral reasons, but also because I want quality food with real flavour, not bland pap from scraggy, diseased animals.</P>
    <P>We do animals no favours by projecting our own values onto them. Animals can feel pain, but they have no capacity for abstract thought. Unlike humans, they do not take an existential view. The lamb you ate last Sunday, whatever else it went through, did not have its life chances dashed when it was slaughtered. A promising future career as a computer programmer was not brought to a premature end. Indeed, were it not for the market for meat, that lamb would never have existed in the first place.</P>
    <P>Vegetarianism fails adequately to address the issue of animal welfare, because it focuses on death, not on life. By choosing to buy humanely-reared chickens and refusing to buy factory-farmed ones, I am doing more to advance the cause of animal welfare than someone who eats no meat.</P>
    <P>Vegetarians also argue that rearing animals for meat is an inefficient use of arable land, which raises world grain prices and leads to third world starvation. So far as large-scale beef production is concerned, this may be a valid argument. But it is an argument for eating less meat, not for eating no meat.</P>
    <P>The production of pork or chicken, for example, even under humane conditions, requires relatively little land. Pigs, reared free range, can forage for food in woodland, and provide an economic justification for replanting trees on farmland. More importantly, sheep and goats provide a means of farming marginal land, which would be no use for growing arable crops.</P>
    <P>A complete abstinence from meat, far from resolving the problem of third world starvation, would instead reduce the amount of land on the planet available for the production of food. A far more effective solution would be for people in developed nations to scale down their beef consumption and instead consider beef as an occasional treat.</P>
    <P>Vegetarians believe that eating meat is unhealthy, and the high incidence of heart disease and cancer in northern European nations is cited as evidence for this. But consider the French paradox. The French eat a diet which is as high in meat as ours, yet suffer a much lower rate of heart disease, even in Normandy with a cuisine rich in butter and cream.</P>
    <P>The answer is probably that the French diet is leavened with red wine (a known antidote to high cholesterol) plus a healthy dose of fish, vegetables and fruit. In Scotland, where there is the highest incidence of heart disease in the world, the most notable thing about the diet is not how much meat is eaten but how little fresh fruit and vegetables.</P>
    <P>It is widely recognised that the healthiest diet is a Mediterranean one, with red wine, olive oil, pasta, fruit, vegetables, and (whether you like it or not) fish and meat. Less red meat than we in Britain tend to eat, admittedly, but meat nonetheless. It is not meat per se that is  unhealthy, but an unbalanced diet.</P>
    <P>And what have vegetarians to say about the positive contribution of fish to a healthy diet? Oily fish (such as mackerel), in particular, play an important part in combating heart disease. And if self-styled 'health food' is so healthy, why are half the shelves in the average health food shop stocked, not with real food, but vitamin supplements and quack remedies?</P>
    <P>Vegetarians tend to assume the moral high ground but most of them lack a morally consistent position. We've all met them. The 'vegetarian' who won't eat meat but will eat fish. The 'vegetarian' who eats neither meat nor fish, but will happily eat battery-farmed eggs or cheese containing animal rennet. The 'vegetarian' who won't touch meat, fish or eggs, but drinks milk without a thought for what might be going on in the dairy industry. The 'vegetarian' who will eat no animal products but walks around in leather shoes.</P>
    <P>Since most vegetarians consume dairy produce, I'd like to know what alternative use they propose for surplus male calves. Have they ever tried milking a bull? That's why I admire vegans. They're loonies, but at least they're morally consistent loonies.</P>
    <P>The popularity of vegetarianism in Britain today tells us far more about the confused state of Anglo-Saxon morality than it does about concern for animal welfare. The growing popularity of vegetarianism is a product not just of anthropomorphism but also of our squeamishness and puritanism.</P>
    <P>Squeamishness is a product of urbanisation. We British were industrialised nearly 200 years ago, long before most of our European neighbours. Most of us have lost touch with how meat and fish are produced. A reluctance to handle raw meat and raw fish helps make highly-processed animal flesh more popular. Many British people kid themselves that they eating less meat, when in fact they're eating just as much, but in the form of microwavable cheeseburgers, a frozen 'Hawaiian-style Pizza', or perhaps a 'Chicken Korma For One'.</P>
    <P>This squeamishness, paradoxically, makes the animal welfare situation worse, not better. The meat that goes into such processed, 'value-added' foods is much more likely to come from dubious sources. By avoiding buying meat and fish in its raw state, consumers are thinking only of themselves.</P>
    <P>Our puritanism is deeply ingrained and part of our Protestant heritage. It lends respectability to any form of self-denial. Why else would most vegetarian restaurants be such joyless places, with hard seats and harsh lighting, in which food seems to be eaten as a penance? The contrast with Catholic southern Europe, where food is a source of daily communal celebration, is marked. No wonder vegetarianism has never really caught on there.</P>
    <P>If you want to be a 'vegetarian', that's fine by me. I'm a Liberal, and I respect individual choice. Individuals should be free to choose whether or not to eat meat, or fish, or Brussels sprouts for that matter. But there is a difference  between your personal lifestyle preferences and any practical political option.</P>
    <P>So by all means avoid beef if you want to. Boycott haddock. Abstain from celery. But don't assume the moral high ground. And have the honesty to distinguish between your subjective feelings, and practical actions likely to improve the lot of farm animals or fellow human beings.</P>

    </CENTER>
    <P><B>Most readers would agree</B> that John Major can claim little credit for anything. But, on the principle that even a broken clock is right twice a day, there was one thing which most of us might have been thankful for, and that was the Northern Ireland peace agreement. The IRA bomb at Canary Wharf must bring that achievement into question. The immediate blame for this outrage rests firmly with the IRA. The political context is another matter.</P>
    <P>Nothing can justify planting terrorist bombs. But the Canary Wharf bomb would not have occurred had the British Government not been stalling on the peace agreement. The Government's demands for decommissioning of weapons and for elections to all-party talks do not stem from a realistic assessment of what will bring about a lasting peace. They are motivated by the Government's desire to appease the Ulster Unionists.</P>
    <P>The Conservatives' parliamentary majority is being whittled away by death and defection. You do not need to be a qualified actuary to realise that this majority will disappear at some point during 1996. If Canary Wharf teaches us anything, it is that the Tories will stop at nothing to cling on to power until the last possible moment. In this context, the 9 Official Unionist votes in the Commons represent a lifeline to the Tories.</P>
    <P>We must therefore ask the question: why did Tony Blair and Paddy Ashdown not express this blindingly obvious point? In the immediate aftermath of a terrorist bomb, the pressure is on for all spokespeople to condemn the outrage and express sympathy for those killed or injured. But a courageous politician would then go on to draw some fundamental lessons.</P>
    <P>It is not enough for opposition politicians to open up the thesaurus at the word 'condemn' each time a bomb goes off, and offer no analysis or prescription. Now is surely the time for the opposition to abandon formally the all-party consensus and to challenge the Government's true motives. British politicians ought to look at recent peace agreements in the Middle East and South Africa. They would then realise that disarmament is a subject on the agenda of all-party talks, not a precondition for such talks.</P>
    <P>It would be a shame if John Major sacrificed his one real political achievement on the altar of Unionist intransigence. But it would be just as great a shame if opposition politicians accepted this agenda instead of offering bold alternatives.</P>
    <HR>
    <H2>Plus Ca Change...</H2>
    <P><B>If the truth be told,</B> the debate within the Liberal Democrats about Tony Blair's 'New Labour' has been dominated by, not only parochial considerations, but also a fear for the Liberal Democrats' political virginity. The greatest danger of a Labour government tends to be forgotten - that a Labour government will leave the Tories' highly centralised government machine intact, ready for a subsequent Tory administration to inherit at some time in the future.</P>
    <P>The new book by Peter Mandelson and Roger Liddle offers few reassurances on that score, with its talk of 'super ministers', a dictatorial role for the Prime Minister, and an all-powerful overseeing job that looks suspiciously like a job description for one P Mandelson.</P>
    <P>A priority for any incoming non-Tory administration should be to dismantle the apparatus of autocratic government, so that the Tories can never possess absolute power again. That means some form of electoral reform. It means devolution of power to local government and to Scottish and Welsh parliaments. It means a Freedom of Information Act. It means the effective abolition of a corrupt and pernicious MI5. It means the break-up of monopolies of media ownership. Above all, it means a system of checks and balances instead of the exercise by ministers of the absolute powers of the Crown. But the signs are not good. For example, Labour should be committing itself to dismantling the 'quangocracy'. Instead, it is engaged in an internal row between those who want to return powers to elected bodies and those who see quangos as a future means of patronage.</P>
    <P>Liberator readers doubtless have firm views on the subject of deals with Labour. But if Paddy Ashdown finds himself holding the balance of power after the next general election, this is the area where he can and should extract the best deals. His role is to ask Blair: do you want to challenge the Tory machine or merely run it yourself? A Labour government will be concentrating its efforts on the economic front. In this area of policy, the Liberal Democrats will have no clout, either because they agree with Labour, or because they have nothing to say, or because Labour can call their bluff.</P>
    <P>Why not outflank Labour on the left and demand some constitutional changes which are no skin off Labour's nose but would help prevent the recurrent nightmare of Tory rule?</P>

    <P>Kennington is a south London suburb which compensates for its general insalubrity by its proximity to Westminster. It is thus the London hang-out of Paddy Ashdown and of many other luminaries of politics.</P>
    <P>Three very prominent Liberal Democrats were making their way through the neighbourhood one recent night when they were obliged to halt abruptly to make way for a rather upmarket car, which had just moved off nearby, and swished imperiously past. In it they recognised Labour leader Tony Blair. As they rounded the next corner, hard by Ashdown Towers, who should they see but Ashdown himself, standing on his doorstep with the appearance of one who has just seen off a guest. They speculated that Blair had been invited in for a birthday drink (which they had not).</P>
    <HR>
    <H2><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="../rb2.gif">Turning Thurnham</H2>
    <P>As of early March former Tory MP Peter Thurnham is sitting as an Independent and not as a Liberal Democrat. And the local party in Westmoreland and Lonsdale has made it clear that it would not be prepared to evict its current PPC to make way for Thurnham to be a Liberal Democrat candidate there, a course of action redolent of Westminster hothouse plotting.</P>
    <P>That is how it should be. Although Thurnham probably falls into a broad swathe of people who are not too bad as Tories go, there is nothing to suggest that he has changed his mind and become a Liberal Democrat. Indeed, he has not claimed to have done so.</P>
    <P>The main reason given for his grievance with the Tories was his failure to make the Westmoreland short-list, rather than fundamental issues of principle, as appeared to be the case with Emma Nicholson.</P>
    <P>There were talks with the Liberal Democrats, and senior party figures seem to have played a key role in Thurnham's final decision to leave the Tories.</P>
    <P>But 'Independent Conservative' seems a wholly accurate description of Thurnham. The Liberal Democrats cannot credibly start offering a home to every Tory miffed about missing out on a seat selection.</P>

    <HR WIDTH=50%>
    <P><B>Liberalism is not, as Margaret Thatcher ignorantly supposes,</B> about minimum government: it is about minimum oppression. Oppression is  not always by government. It may be done by anyone who has power. Who can be more oppressed than a Filipino maid, beaten, starved and locked up by her employer, and unable to escape for fear of being deported as an illegal immigrant? In this sort of situation, the intervention of the state can create liberty, by freeing people from the arbitrary power of private individuals. This is the sort of case which should serve to construct a paradigm of Liberal principles on Social Security.</P>
    <P>If asked 'what is the Social Security system for', the basic answer must be that it ensures that people have enough to eat to stay alive, and a roof over their heads to keep the frost out. I do not advance this as a natural right, though I would often like to: I know that were I the President of Ethiopia, I might have to admit that I was unable to deliver such a right. I see no need to admit this in Britain, which, for all its economic woes, is still securely in the top ten economic powers in the world. We do not have to let our people starve, and the 350 a year who die on the London streets are a mark of political, not of economic failure.</P>
    <P>I would base this on the central bargain which English lawyers have recognised for centuries as giving legitimacy to the state. We owe the state allegiance because the state owes us protection. It has been understood, at least since the Elizabethan Poor Law, that 'protection' does not just mean external defence: it means that the state has an obligation to keep its citizens alive if it can. That includes an obligation, so far as its power extends, to protect them against poverty.</P>
    <P>If we deprive people of that protection, we are doing something very like the medieval process of making them outlaws: we are depriving them of the protection of the state. To what extent that relieves them of the obligation to obey the state is a question I am reluctant to stir too far: I have never been quite sure that I agree with St. Thomas Aquinas that the destitute commit no sin if they steal to support themselves. It is a useful quotation to throw at John Patten or Anne Widdecombe, but it is a slippery slope, and I would rather we kept off it.</P>
    <P>Being destitute also means being subject to the arbitrary power of anyone willing to offer support, however unpleasant. It means people may be compelled by fear of starvation to take up drug pushing or prostitution. This is neither liberal nor good for society: it is another form of being subject to arbitrary power, and one of the purposes of Social security is to save people from it. Some 16 and 17 year olds, with no right of benefit, are being pushed into prostitution against their sexual orientation. Can arbitrary power go much further? We are committed as a party by the LDYS motion at Harrogate in 1992 not to disentitle groups of people as a class to Social Security benefits regardless of what they have done. I would like to go further: I would like a policy that we do not disentitle anyone to benefits. we have abolished the death penalty: we should not use the Social Security system to bring it in by the back door.</P>
    <P>This does not mean that the state has no rights. In return for protection we have a duty to keep the laws. The laws at present require us, if unemployed, to seek work actively. As a party, we see nothing wrong with that: it is a perfectly reasonable bargain. If we do not obey this obligation to seek work, we may legitimately be punished. The difficulty is how to punish people we do not want to imprison, and who have no property. It seems that there has to be a benefit penalty short of disentitlement, but until benefit levels can be higher, the penalty cannot be large one without breaking the state's duty to keep people alive and in sufficient health to resume work when there is a chance.</P>
    <P>The state's financial interest in the benefit system is to ensure that people who lose their jobs remain employable and do not fall ill or disappear into a criminal underclass. If, as we are told, the job for life becomes rarer, this function of the benefit system will become even more essential. this means the system needs a host of detailed alterations to make it easier for people to get off benefit into work. This is now an all-party consensus, and we contributed a great deal to making it so. This principle holds together many of the measures we approved at Brighton in 1994. It is one in which humanity and the state's financial interest coincide.</P>
    <P>The obligation of actively seeking work should be consistent with some dignity and individuality. The disabled woman who was held not to be actively seeking work because she would not work as a nude model is a story we should not have to hear again. Similarly, people who leave jobs because of sexual harassment should not be punished for being voluntarily unemployed. It is not only Cabinet ministers who should be able to say 'I can no longer serve with honour'.</P>
    <P>The whole system should be run in the knowledge that it is being applied to individuals, who cannot be treated exactly alike. All politicians in office are tempted to treat people as if they were plasticine - to mould them into whatever shapes they like the look of. People on benefit, because of their comparative powerlessness, are very vulnerable to this approach. As Nancy Seear has stressed many times, any obligation to undertake training must be suitable training. We do not want cases like the man who wanted to work with animals, and was sent to work in an abattoir, or the asthmatic who was sent to work as a painter. Both were refused benefit for rejecting these opportunities, the asthmatic after making himself ill trying. We do not want illiterates required to produce written records of their job applications, as has happened despite ministerial attempts to prevent it.</P>
    <P>Two conclusions follow from this. One is that we should be very careful in making arbitrary rules which require people to fit into a particular pattern which they may have good reason for objecting to. In particular, we must beware of the formula. Formulas, because they deny individuality, are particularly illiberal things. The formula for the medical test for Incapacity Benefit for unfitness to work and Child Support Formula for the C.S.A. both attempt to treat people alike by leaving out half the relevant evidence. That is treating people as if they were plasticine. For example, to require people to pay a set sum to support their children regardless of the fact that they may be paying thousands to support their parents is neither good humanity nor good budgeting for the state.</P>
    <P>The second is that the whole system needs to be better controlled by law. The sudden arbitrary deprivation of benefit before any appeal is very much like the "civilised" modern version of the midnight knock on the door, and may be just as devastating in its effects. Take, for example, the man in Sussex who needed a car to go to work. He had a car breakdown on the way to work, did not get there, and was dismissed. He then suffered a 40% loss of benefit for 'voluntary unemployment', and presumably had to sell the car without which he could not work, thus becoming unemployable. That is the sort of thing that happens if people can lose benefit before appeal. It gives quite junior functionaries the sort of power no one in a civilised country should be allowed. It is profoundly illiberal - and a reminder that the Social Security system stands to save money by better public transport.</P>
    <P>The system is run by regulations, which are very hard for Parliament to check. This is justified by claims of 'flexibility' very like those made by Geoffrey Howe and William Waldegrave for the guidelines for the export of arms to Iraq. In each case, it means our old friend the Cambises Clause: "The Secretary of State may do what ever he likes". That sort of power isn't any good for anyone. It isn't good for Liberals either. The difference is that we know it isn't good for us. It is a case of the familiar Liberal principle that we need to come into office ready to control our own power.  To that end, European law, with its concentration on general principles, is likely to be our best instrument. It is yet another reason for joining the Social Chapter.</P>
    <P>None of this has said very much about cost. We are quite right to be worried about cost, but we need to identify where the costs are coming from before we can control them. The costs come from two things. One is the increase of people of pensionable age, which has risen from 11% to 16% of the population since 1951. However, it is only projected to rise another 2%, to 18%, before 2021. For the next 25 years our competitors will be experiencing much more rapid rises than us. We might be thinking in terms of a rise in the retirement age after 2021, but it is not an urgent problem.</P>
    <P>The other big problem is the number of people out of work. This is a bigger number than the unemployment figures show. 13.2% of adults depend on Income Support, and this figure, unlike the unemployment figures, is still rising. No less than 25.4% of children are on Income Support. This is not yet all. We must add in the number of people of people over 50 who have not worked for ten years. This number is 2,594,000 people. Some of these will be included in the Income Support figures, but in many cases unemployment is disguised as early retirement, and are increasing the actuarial pressure on pension funds. when we consider how many people it is being asked to support, the Social Security budget is cheap at the price. Anyone who blames the Department of Social Security for the cost of the Social Security budget is shooting the messenger. It is like blaming the inhabitants of Lundy Island because their beaches are covered with oil.</P>
    <P>If we put people under the obligation actively seeking work,  there is a duty on us to make sure there is some work to seek. Social Security can contribute some policies, such as childcare and better tapers, to bring this happy state of affairs about. The main solutions are in the hands of the economic ministries.</P>
    <P>So long as we have something over 20% of the population dependent on means tested benefits of one sort or another, there is no cheaper solution than the one we have at present. The people will not go away if they lose benefit. Some may become homeless, some may fall ill, some may get divorced, some may take to crime, prostitution or drug pushing. Some may do all of these things. None of them are ones the state can legitimately regard as an economy. There is no cheaper solution until these people have work. Anything else is like blaming Lundy Island for the cost of cleaning up its beaches. we have to stop the spill first. Thank God we, unlike Labour, belong to a party whose leaders know these things.</P>

    <P><B>The Liberal Democrats can be proud of their opposition to the Government's bulldozing through parliament of stop and search powers.</B> It is considerably more than 'new' Labour.</P>
    <P>The Liberal Democrats smoked out the fiction that these powers were a response to an emergency. The police had sought them for some time, but they were introduced neither before the ceasefire, nor immediately after it ended, nor during the debate soon after on the prevention of terrorism act.</P>
    <P>Why could these powers not have been subject to normal parliamentary scrutiny? As Alan Beith said, that is what parliament is for. If it cannot scrutinise legislation it might as well not exist.</P>
    <P>It is hard to avoid the conclusion that the Government's priority was to embarrass Labour, by forcing it either to alienate its own civil libertarians by supporting the measure, or be painted as 'soft on terrorism' by opposing them.</P>
    <P>Labour duly leapt into the trap. The way 'new' Labour is going, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that, even if the IRA disarmed and disbanded tomorrow, a Labour government would retain these powers the better to harass beggars, 'squeegy merchants' and other of Jack Straw's scapegoats.</P>
    <P>Any free society faced with a terrorist threat has to take special powers to confront it. But the fact that those powers are special requires that they are examined properly before being implemented, and that the limits of their use are clearly defined.</P>
    <P>Hasty legislation is almost by definition bad legislation; ill-thought-out, and unlikely to be effective. This ineffectiveness leads to a ratchet effect of increasingly oppressive legislation. And governments rarely voluntarily surrender authoritarian powers.</P>
    <P>This point may have been at the back of the Liberal Democrats' minds. It was after all a Liberal government which in 1911 forced through the Official Secrets Act in one day, in a similar spate of panic. Not even Michael Howard pretends that the Kaiser's spies still pose a threat. But the powers to deal with them are still there.</P>
    <P>This was not the only recent issue over which Labour lay down to be counted. Its attempt to loosen the Tories' proposals on cross-media ownership suggest that in Government it would be as concerned as the Tories to abuse power to do its friends favours. Its pathetic evasions over the sale of Railtrack symbolise its intention  to merely mind the shop for the Tories.</P>
    <P>Every utterance of Tony Blair's stresses what he will not change, not what he will. With every speech he commits himself to keep his hands off yet another part of Thatcher's Britain.</P>
    <P>Labour is trying to gain power without winning any arguments and without committing itself to any changes. It is relying entirely on public disgust with the Tories incompetence and  sleaze.</P>
    <P>There is a strong and serious arguments that democracy will not long survive uninterrupted one-party government.</P>
    <P>But a Labour government elected on a platform of promising not to do anything will find at the first sign of trouble that its support is built on quicksand.</P>
    <P>Even in their present dire straits, the Tories seem more intellectually confident than 'new' Labour, as well they might be since Blair challenges none of their basic assumptions.</P>
    <P>Far from getting closer to Labour, its current behaviour opens up a huge gap for the Liberal Democrats, or anyone bold enough to fill it.</P>
    <HR>
    <H2>To Them That Have</H2>
    <P><B>Whatever one thinks of the Liberal Democrats' new support for student loans,</B> there is an issue they must sort out quickly if they are not to send canvassers naked onto the doorsteps of student voters (and more to the point, parents of intending students).</P>
    <P>Repayment of loans once one's income rises above a certain level is fine for those whose qualifications are reasonably likely to move them rapidly to a high income. It is also fine in a way for those in vocations who may never hit the threshold.</P>
    <P>It is not fine at all for the vast bulk in the middle, who, because interest will rack up on loan repayments, face eventually paying back far more than will wealthier contemporaries who progress more quickly to higher incomes.</P>
    <P>Even if one accepts the basic argument, this is a gaping flaw. It effectively forces most intending students to gamble thousands of pounds of debt against the likelihood that their future salary increases will outstrip rising interest payments.</P>
    <P>Paddy Ashdown said this debate showed the Liberal Democrats taking 'tough' decisions. 'Tough' need not be a synonym for 'gratuitously courting unpopularity'. It will be if this policy's loose ends are not tied up.</P>

    <P>The second of the Liberal Democrat party political broadcasts under the control of its general election team was certainly unusual. Did you know the connection between Paddy Ashdown, the Three Graces, a wealthy retired gardener and the Ribble Valley by-election? No? Evidence suggests few viewers of the broadcast did either.</P>
    <P>The first oddity was that it was silent with captions and music.</P>
    <P>What was more unusual was the content. Each year since the party's formation in 1988 rolled by with notable events linked to Liberal Democrat achievements.</P>
    <P>The selection of the former bordered on the weird. 1988 was marked by Eddie The Eagle. Didn't the party wish to get away from the image of being an heroic failure? It was also the year Elton John auctioned his possessions at Sotheby's, but then of course no-one needed reminding of that.</P>
    <P>Oh, and Paddy Ashdown was elected leader of 'the only British party to have one-member one-vote elections.'</P>
    <P>1989 was marked by that noted tipple 'beer with the alcohol taken out' going on sale in pubs, and of course by the number of Liberal Democrats councillors exceeding 3,000. It wisely refrained from pointing out that this was a decrease.</P>
    <P>In 1990, as everyone remembers, the English National Ballet was saved by the Arts Council and 'an Oxfordshire man refuses to remove a shark from his roof'. Meanwhile 'the Liberal Democrats wrong foot the Conservatives in the Eastbourne by-election'. Why not come out and say that they won it?</P>
    <P>1991 saw Gerald Ratner in trouble for describing his own goods as 'crap' [why put ideas into viewers' heads? - Collective] and the victory in Ribble Valley.</P>
    <P>And what of 1992? 'A retied gardener finds Roman treasure worth 10 million', as if anyone knew or cared now. 'And the Liberal Democrats continue their rise in popularity. 20 MPs are elected'. Pity it was 24 before the election, but there you go.</P>
    <P>And what great issues did that trusty band get stuck into the next year? 1993 was marked by 'England's cricketers [being] told to smarten up', and it was 'goodbye to Sunday lie-ins for shop workers as Parliament passes Sunday trading laws'. An unnecessarily pejorative way of describing an issue on which there was no party line and where reform was supported actively by many Liberal Democrats.</P>
    <P>From here on at least the Liberal Democrat events mentioned were all genuine advances straightforwardly described, though the comparative events, including keeping the Three Graces in Britain and the banging-up of Nick Leeson were consistently peculiar.</P>
    <P>The final caption said 'The news is the Liberal Democrats are growing in strength, winning the trust of those millions of people. Join the people who are making the news'.</P>
    <P>After each such broadcast volunteer teams are drafted into Cowley Street to deal with the rush of phone calls from enthused members of the public.</P>
    <P>For reasons that can best be guessed at, it was deemed unnecessary to call on other party members in building who had been told to hold themselves on standby to assist the volunteers with the expected rush. One estimate was that this generated the lowest response of any Liberal Democrat broadcast.</P>
    <P>But perhaps viewers were simply too busy trying to work out what on earth it had been about to spare time for that vital phone call.</P>

      <H2>Ending Poverty, Increasing Choice</H2>
    </CENTER>
    <P><B><I>Liberal Democrat policy on financing higher education took a lot of stick at and after the Nottingham conference. Policy working party member Michael Woods argues that the proposals are honest, realistic and principled.</I></B></P>
    <HR WIDTH=50%>
    <P><B>They say that timing is everything. One day the government announces an inquiry into higher education, the next the Liberal Democrats launch their new higher education policy. One day a BBC journalist reports that the government will not risk the favoured but politically sensitive option of student loans repaid through National Insurance; the next day the Liberal Democrats introduce a policy based on -loans to students repaid through National Insurance.</B></P>
    <P>Foolish or farsighted? The reaction of many radical Liberal Democrats has been, predictably and understandably, one of horror. Colin Ross in Liberator 235 and columns of speakers at the Nottingham conference have articulated genuine unease about a policy which appears to swap a long-standing and allegedly 'fair' system of student funding for one in which they claim to detect the whiff of Thatcherism. I think both these presumptions are disputable - the old system wasn't fair, and our proposed new system needn't be Thatcherite.</P>
    <P>The present system of student grants is clearly neither fair nor effective. A recent survey has confirmed that the average student debt on graduation varies between 1,500 and 4,000 depending on age and geography; with mature students being most debt-laden. At the same time, means-tested grants discriminate most against those potential students whose parents earn just above the threshold, but whom are unable or unwilling to pay their 'parental contribution'. The new policy paper rightly restates our commitment to abolishing the parental contribution - access to higher education should not be determined by parental generosity - but the implication is that all students should receive full grants. Such a policy was sustainable in the mid 1980s, but not today.</P>
    <P>In 1996, we have a higher education sector that has been rattled to its foundations by nearly two decades of reckless expansion without matching investment, forced upon it with the usual cavalier incompetence by a fly-by-night government aided and abetted by greedy university administrators who scrapped for short-term gain without a thought for what would happen when the wind changed. The number of students in HE is now more than the entire population of Northern Ireland; giving them all a 1979-level grant would cost over 4 billion - as much as the whole Employment Department budget for 1994/5. And that's even before we've considered the over-crowded buildings, under-stocked libraries, out-dated equipment, shelved research and the demoralised, under-paid staff; not to mention all the other non-education but equally deserving demands on a Liberal Democrat government's wallet. Even Colin Ross acknowledges that "our old student funding policies are now untenable."</P>
    <P>The sense of crisis in HE was ever-present throughout the working group's deliberations; ideas proposed at one meeting  would be overtaken by events before the next. But it was the  threat by Vice-Chancellors to impose 'top-up' fees that threw our proposals into sharpest relief. The policy paper unequivocally states that the Liberal Democrats will "ensure that education is made available free at the point of entry." That is worth repeating: a Liberal Democrat government would ensure that students will not have to pay up front to go to university. That is a guarantee that neither Labour nor the Tories can currently give.</P>
    <P>If students are not to pay-as-they-learn, the money has to come from somewhere. And the fairest solution is that those who have benefited most from a university education should contribute something back. This is not a new idea. The students of the last boom in the 60s and 70s went to university expecting that they would repay the cost through paying a higher rate of income tax. The success of Thatcherism in changing the boundaries of political discourse means that simply hiking up income tax for high earners is no longer an option. To implement the same principle we have to specifically target high-earning graduates and tell them what they are paying for - it's being honest about taxation again.</P>
	 <UL>
     <P>The proposals for student funding contained in the new policy paper are therefore based on two very sound, very liberal, principles:</P>
	  <LI>the State has a duty to enable everyone to meet their potential in tertiary education regardless of their financial position; ensuring that there are no financial restrictions to entering higher education and that no student should be compelled to live in poverty.
     <LI>Those who have benefited financially from their higher education should contribute retrospectively towards the cost of their education - as they are able to afford -in order to give others the same opportunity.
	 </UL>
    <P>Whatever its complexity, the 'Individual Learning Account' (ILA) approach is a much fairer and more effective means of enacting these principles than the present grant system, or student loans, or a graduate tax or any other concoction I have seen suggested. It makes money available to students whilst studying, and protects low-earning graduates from demands to pay up.</P>
    <P>If there is a fault in the policy paper, it is in its ambiguity. Like the Scott Report, the paper can be interpreted in a number of ways. Post-Nottingham, the challenge for radical Liberal Democrats is to ensure that the party leadership interpret it in a manner consistent with the principles outlined above.</P>
    <P>Firstly, it is unclear exactly how much of their tuition and maintenance costs graduates would be expected to repay. The tuition element was originally included on the understanding that student maintenance would be supported through the benefits system - but the paragraph pledging this disappeared shortly before publication along with a commitment of government funding for two years of education or training. At present there is nothing to stop our  opponents suggesting that graduates would have to repay 99%  of the cost - if that is to be avoided then the party has to be clear about how much the government's contribution to ILAs will be. (I trust none of the costings being bandied around - least of all those from David Wheeldon - a lobbyist for the NUS and the most right-wing member of the working group - quoted in Liberator 234).</P>
    <P>Secondly, the fairness of these proposals depends on a respectable minimum earnings threshold for repayment being set. A vague reference to "a certain level" is much too Blairite for credibility and needs to given more precision. The party may be reluctant to indulge in numerical figures, but citing a level relative to average earnings would strengthen the argument.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, if graduates cannot be expected to repay until they meet an earnings threshold, why should their debts accrue interest? Indeed, if interest is charged on debts from the point of borrowing the result will be that those who can least afford it will end up paying more - undermining the whole logic of the ILA framework. If we must charge interest on ILA debts - and I am unconvinced - we should state that interest will only be triggered at the same point as repayment, and we have to indicate what the rate of interest might be (Colin Ross is right to say that 1.5% above the mortgage rate is too high).</P>
    <P>Finally, the policy paper was about more than student funding. Much of what it says about increasing access, promoting choice, ensuring quality and investing in research will be welcomed - but not everything. The much-quoted gushing praise of the policy paper from the Association of University Teachers omitted the more lukewarm comment that "the proposal to move research funds from the funding councils to the research councils needed to be treated with caution". The conventional wisdom is that concentrating all research funds with the research councils is incompatible with guaranteeing active research across the university sector - but the policy paper promises both. The present wording may be a convenient compromise, but more thought will be needed to convince the academic community. Similarly, at a time when Nottingham Trent University's proposed honorary degree for Ken Clarke has exposed the undemocratic governance of universities (effectively super-quangos), the policy paper says very little on what might have been expected to be a Liberal speciality (largely due to the disinterest of those drafting the paper). Instead we are left with a less radical policy on university governance than the CVCP!</P>
    <P>'The Key to Lifelong Learning' is not a perfect policy paper, but it is an honest, realistic, principled, fundamentally fair and timely response to a problem created (as ever) by Tory incompetence. Labour and the Tories may choose to hide behind Dearing with their usual cowardice, but they know that the outcome of his inquiry will be some form of student contribution. Even the NUS have abandoned grants for a system remarkably like that we propose. Of  course some of our more scurrilous opponents will make  sniper attacks from the safety of their policy vacuums -but only if we let them. Far from 'new HE policy' and 'vote-loser' being synonyms, I believe that policies such as 'more money for students', 'ending student poverty', 'no entry fees', 'more choice in education', 'increasing access to education', 'ending the part-time/full-time divide', 'ending the vocational/academic divide', 'investing in education', 'investing in research', and 'protecting low earning graduates' can and must be turned into vote winners. The task for radical Liberal Democrats in all sections of the party is now to ensure that the principles and the promise of this policy are honoured by the party leadership.</P>

   <H2>The Last Straw</H2>
  </CENTER>
    <P><B>Jack Straw, Labour's Shadow Home Secretary, is pursuing a strategy of out-toughing the Tories on law and order.</B> His latest proposal, to impose a night-time curfew on all children, certainly does that.</P>
    <P>But why stop there? Why not have everyone locked-up permanently? That should work wonders for the crime statistics.</P>
    <P>Law and order has traditionally been seen as Tory territory. But the Tories' record on tackling crime looks decidedly threadbare. For all the Tories' talk (not to mention a massive increase in spending on police and prisons), their 17 years in office have seen crime continue to rise.</P>
    <P>Tory policy has been essentially about playing to the gallery, by making 'tough' gestures without actually achieving anything. This failure presents an opportunity to opposition parties.</P>
    <P>Tony Blair's slogan (developed before he became Labour leader), 'tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime', showed promise. It demonstrated a belated recognition on the left of people's legitimate fears about crime (and, indeed, it is Labour's natural supporters in Britain's poorest communities who suffer from crime more than anyone else).</P>
    <P>But it also demonstrated a recognition that crime has roots in social and economic problems and is not simply a product of 'evil'. This sophisticated response is now being abandoned by Labour. Crime is a difficult issue for any elected politician to tackle intelligently. People's responses tend to be highly emotional, and these emotions are regularly whipped up by the tabloid press. How much easier it is to pander to prejudice, lock up more people and subject some of them to pointless military drill.</P>
    <P>The art of politics is usually about reconciling principles and pragmatism. Labour has to address real issues if it wants to win the next election. But there comes a point at which principles are compromised fatally. Jack Straw has now gone beyond that point.</P>
    <P>On this, as on other issues, Labour has displayed remarkable timidity in confronting Tory values, for fear of a bad press. But if Labour wins, it will be because people want a change, not because they want more of the same.</P>
    <P>What is the point of a change of government if there will be no change in policy?</P>
    <HR>
    <H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Where's The Beef?</H2>
    <P><B>If you want to know why a traditional nickname for the Conservatives is 'The Stupid Party',</B> you need look no further than Britain's 'war' with its partners in the European Union over the beef crisis.</P>
    <P>Here was a crisis of the Tories' own making. By deregulating animal feed, the government allowed manufacturers to include the flesh of diseased sheep in feed destined for herbivorous animals. Warnings at the time were rubbished or ignored.</P>
    <P>Only when a crisis of consumer confidence broke out earlier this year did the government react seriously to the threat of BSE. By this stage, a multi-million pound export industry faced ruin.</P>
    <P>It is hardly surprising that many consumers do not want to take the risk of contracting a fatal brain disease. Large numbers of British consumers abandoned beef overnight (although many have been won back by supermarket price cuts). But they were not subjected to abuse by the British government. The governments of the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand all moved quickly to block imports of British beef But they were not subjected to British sanctions.</P>
    <P>Why single out the EU for blame? The answer is simple. Tory strategy has nothing whatever to do with restoring consumer confidence or raising standards in the beef industry. It a shameless publicity stunt.</P>
    <P>This 'war' is simply a vehicle for Tory Euro-sceptics to attack the European Union. As a practical measure, British blocking tactics in the Council of Ministers are counterproductive. 'Non co-operation' makes it less likely that our EU partners will co-operate with us in restoring confidence in British beef. We should not forget that Europe is the largest market for our beef exports; before the BSE crisis, France alone accounted for more than half of all our exports.</P>
    <P>Does anyone seriously imagine that the EU would have been any more sympathetic if Britain were outside the EU? Europe would have simply blocked British beef imports and the British government would have been powerless to do anything about it.</P>
    <P>A sensible political strategy would have enlisted the support of our European partners. Instead, what we are getting from the British government is a crude piece of xenophobia designed to appeal to the worst instincts of the domestic electorate.</P>
    <P>It is the last throw of a government desperate to cling on to power at any price. That price is being paid by British beef farmers.</P>

  <H2><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="../rb2.gif">Then There Were Two</H2>
  <P>The Liberal Democrats are always ready to stress their commitment to ethnic minorities, so it remains to be seen how they will cope with the imminent arrival of two organisations, both of which claim to be the legitimate Ethnic Minority Liberal Democrats.</P>
  <P>One is led by Ramesh Dewan (Liberator 236), who succeeded in getting a slate elected to the executive, after rival candidates withdrew claiming irregularities in the election process.</P>
  <P>Nasser Butt, who chairs the party's Multi-Faith Forum, himself withdrew from the elections and encouraged others to do likewise. He is now setting up the other EMLD. In a circular he has sent to party officers and MPs, he names Navnit Dholakia, Zerbanoo Gifford, and Rabi Martins among his supporters.</P>
  <P>The disputed election was overseen by president Robert Maclennan and by David Alworthy, Cowley Street's head of membership. The Butt group's circular makes a number of serious allegations about the election's conduct and related matters, which at the very least should be investigated by some disinterested body. These centre on disputes about the alleged validity of the EMLD membership of many of those who voted. Since the new EMLD is threatening to challenge the Dewan version at every level of the party's processes, this may yet force some fresh intervention by Cowley Street.</P>
  <P>One Dewan supporter is Pash Nandra, who was recently selected as PPC for Harrow West after Cowley Street ordered a re-run of the original election which she lost by three votes to former council leader Chris Noyce. The re-run election was held, on federal party instructions, on a different electoral roll to the original, allowing a large number of people who joined in the intervening period to vote. This continues to be controversial in the constituency.</P>
  <HR>
  <H2><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="../rb2.gif">Hanging In The Privy</H2>
  <P>David Steel's portrait now hangs in the National Liberal Club. Sir David had taken the perhaps unusual decision to wear full Privy Council dress for the sitting, though admitting that the practice had effectively died out with the likes of Ted Heath and Christopher Soames.</P>
  <P>Privy Councillor not withstanding, what was Sir David doing with this piece of schmutter? Lady Read, the wife of Sir Carol, had passed it on, advising him "Wear it whenever the spirit moves you". The portrait, by Anthony Oakshett, has a wry wit about it. The spirit apparently moved Sir David on the basis that he thought the portrait might fit in with several others of previous generations adorning the Club's walls.</P>
  <P>However it does prompt the too obvious RB comment about hanging it in the Privy; sorry David, you knew that one was coming. But then he would be in good company, that of F E Smith, Lord Birkenhead, the Tory Chancellor famed for using those facilities.</P>

   <H2>The Blair Revolution: Can New Labour Deliver?</H2>
   <H3>by Peter Mandelson and Roger Liddle<BR>Faber, 7.99</H3>
  </CENTER>
  <P>What is the point of the Labour Party?</P>
  <P>For years, we thought we knew. Labour may have embraced a wide spectrum of views from social democracy to near-Leninism, but it remained constitutionally committed to common ownership: it was broadly clear that a Labour government would mean more state ownership, and more state control, of industry and the provision of social services, and less reliance on market forces.</P>
  <P>A decade of victorious Thatcherism and global socialist retreat shattered Labour's self-confidence. Labour rejected its past, abandoned Clause 4, and put in its place - well, what?</P>
  <P>Two of Tony Blair's closest advisers, Peter Mandelson and leading social democrat Roger Liddle, were supposed to provide the answer with this book.</P>
  <P>They fail. Roy Hattersley, one of the few people left in the Labour Party who seems to have any idea what he stands for, described this book as "banal, pretentious, and risibly inadequate". Mr. Hattersley can be criticised only for understatement.</P>
  <P>The message is that things are awful under the Tories. They really are tremendously awful. But look, here is new Labour, which Mandelson and Liddle unveil in the political equivalent of a corporate public relations brochure - long on feelgood phrases and short on content. We have two hundred and sixty pages of "concepts" and "ideas", which are, of course, "meaningful".</P>
  <P>"Times change", we are told "and we must learn from experience and live in the world as it now is". Liddle and Mandelson do not explain how it would be possible to live in the world as it now isn't. "Community is a robust and powerful idea, and it is at the heart of the stakeholder economy New Labour wishes to create. It means teamwork ... It means mutuality ... It means justice...". It is a pity that we are not told exactly what "community" is, or how it will achieve these wonderful things.</P>
  <P>If you are trying to promote a political party which has no idea what it is for, you can always try creating a personality cult around the leader. Liddle and Mandelson devote an embarrassingly sycophantic chapter to Tony Blair himself. Here is a flavour: "Importantly, Blair is not a prude or a prig in his private life. He never tries to push religion on anyone, and most people would never realise he goes to church every Sunday. He does not feel morally superior to those who choose to live their lives differently, and he is not judgmental about those friends who are not in conventional marriages or who are single parents, or who are gay." Well, that's alright then.</P>
  <P>Amid the jumble of vacuous phrases there are two proposals (or rather, "concepts" - nothing is actually presented as a firm proposal) which have received some attention. Neither is workable and both are somewhat authoritarian.</P>
  <P>One is the idea that the government should give soft loans to "young couples" of, say, a few thousand pounds. How exactly is a "couple" to be defined, and what if they are not "young"? Why should people who choose to live their lives alone (an increasing number) be taxed to subsidise those who don't? Why should a couple of modest means who have saved hard before setting up home together be taxed to pay for a couple with the same income who have simply squandered their money? What would Liddle and Mandelson do about "couples" who have become a couple purely in order to get their hands on the loot? Would gay couples be included? The whole idea is a recipe for unfairness leading to resentment and frustration.</P>
  <P>The other concept is "mentoring": young people in trouble at school or with the police would be taken in hand by a slightly older, more successful person, probably from the same community and the same background. It is hard to see why those selected by the state for "mentoring" would not quickly become stigmatised as potential troublemakers, and would not resent the imposition of an implicitly superior mentor. In particular, mentors would probably be hated by the parents of the young person being mentored. The state would be saying that it could do a better job than the parents and everyone concerned would know it.</P>
  <P>Given the authoritarian streak, Jack Straw's latest proposal, to impose a curfew on young people, comes as no surprise. Perhaps mentors would help to enforce the curfew and soft loans would be withheld from those who had broken it.</P>
  <P>Liddle and Mandelson do not tell us what the point of the Labour Party is, and, to the extent that they come up with anything at all apart from catch-phrases, they reveal a nasty inclination to run our lives for us. Those Liberals who seem to be looking forward to a Blair government should get real.</P>

   <H2>Standing On The Corner</H2>
  </CENTER>
  <P><B><I>There is no point in providing youth clubs when young people really prefer to meet on street corners. Liberal Democrat Oadby and Wigston decided on a liberal approach to youth non-conformity. Councillor Mark Cox explains how.</I></B></P>
  <HR WIDTH=50%>
  <P><B>In the late 1980s I served on Leicestershire County Council's youth and community review. One of the key recommendations was the insistence on more 'face to face' work with young people. Some five years on the county is hardly any further forward towards achieving this aim. However, it is not all doom and gloom. Many individuals and community centres have tried to implement the recommendations within their own resources, with varying success. One such is my borough of Oadby and Wigston.</B></P>
  <P>When the Liberal Democrats took control in 1991 we were determined to do something for young people, even though we were not the statutory authority. Following the setting up of a youth committee, with councillors, young people, youth workers and other members of the community, we commissioned a youth questionnaire. The results confirmed that what young people desired more than anything was face to face contact and information on a range of issues. It was agreed that a detached youth work project should be set up, with the aim of meeting young people where they were - on the streets. The object was to meet and talk with young people about issues of concern to them, to find out more clearly what their real needs were, and to provide information (not advice!) on social issues.</P>
  <P>Since the project started nearly two and a half years ago, we have employed four part-time youth workers, each working five hours a week, to go out on the streets in the evenings to carry out the aims of the project. They have encountered many problems and issues such as drug abuse, homelessness and family break-ups.</P>
  <P>They have passed many young people on to the information and counselling service which is now provided on a Thursday evening. The workers have also instigated two 'drop-in' centres meeting on Mondays and Fridays in different parts of the borough. These are available to any young person in the area and are staffed by two workers. Thy provide somewhere warm and dry for young people to meet and are totally unstructured. The activities that take place are decided by the young people themselves.</P>
  <P>It is important to remember that the remit of the project is not to clear the street corners of young people.</P>
  <P>Many local people, including some councillors and police certainly thought this was the idea. I would argue that nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
  <P>If young people wish to meet in the local park or behind the local shops then we would work with them there, not try to move them on. If a local centre can provide somewhere for them to meet, then that's fine of they wish to go. Some of the best work took place on street corners.</P>
  <P>The second point is that this not an 'outreach' project. The idea is not to make contact and then try to persuade young people to join one of the local clubs. The vast majority of young people know exactly what is on offer in their area, its just that some of them choose not to go.</P>
  <P>The most common statement from adults is that young people 'hang around' on street corners only because there is nothing for them to do. The majority actually enjoy 'hanging around street corners', and would not go to a club even if one were provided. They enjoy talking to their friends; in some cases it is quite a social gathering, and, most importantly, they are not constrained by club type rules.</P>
  <P>I believe this type of work, as well as being successful, is essentially liberal. It places the emphasis on the individual, as opposed to group work, and celebrates young people' non-conformity rather than stifling it. The local Labour Party, for instance, has criticised it for not providing more 'facilities', whatever that means. They fail to appreciate that all young people have different needs and aspirations and simply providing a club does nothing to meet those needs.</P>
  <P>Indeed, some of the youth clubs are struggling to attract young people, yet the drop-in centre has a regular turnover of 60 young people.</P>
  <P>Though it was not the project's original intention to tackle crime directly, it has certainly had an indirect effect. Both the police and neighbourhood watch groups acknowledge that petty crime has reduced since the start of the project, and in particular since the start of the drop-in centres.</P>
  <P>Many other projects have now started around the county. Many youth tutors and local politicians are now realising that it is a relatively cheap and effective way of dealing directly with the concerns of young people.</P>
  <P>One footnote to this is that a few weeks ago the Monday night drop in centre was closed by the local community association because of an alleged theft. Though it was never proved, it was the young people who took the blame. Since then, I've received a petition from local residents complaining about young people 'hanging around' the local park. It seems that we adults never learn, and we should not be surprised if young people hit out when we alienate them from the rest of society. The youth committee is currently searching for an alternative drop in centre venue.</P>

      <H2>Legal Weapons In Environmental Campaigns</H2>
    </CENTER>
    <P><B><I>Liz Loughran reports on an alternative form of legal practice and explains her environmental law work.</I></B></P>
    <HR WIDTH=50%>
    <P><B>Traditional legal practices seem to be putting an ever increasing distance between the market they serve - the clients - and themselves. Combined with the demise of legal aid, the time has come to rethink the way in which the provision of legal services is delivered, a project undertaken by Lord Justice Woolf's Civil Justice Review. One way is for solicitors to learn good practice from barristers. Solicitors Chambers was founded in 1989 with the intention of making high quality legal services available at an affordable price. By keeping overheads to a minimum, the ten sole practitioners who practice at Chambers keep their costs down and can pass these savings on to the clients. As a result, typical hourly rates can be under 50-60% of what a conventional firm would charge. Organising in a similar way to barristers, each member of chambers is self employed, but the client still has the assurance that the matter is being dealt with by an experienced solicitor in the relevant field of law. I am the first woman solicitor to be admitted into this arrangement.</B></P>
    <P>The solicitors in Chambers range from late thirties to early fifties. Specialist legal advice is available on mental health law from a Mental Health Act Commissioner. Another solicitor has come from a major trade union and gives advice on employment law and industrial accidents. There are no common politics. It's quite an idiosyncratic bunch in some respects - just as you would find in any firm of solicitors. The difference is that we can all be who we want without any restrictions on style and personality. If there is any friction, rife in most firms because lawyers are generally appalling managers, it is moderated because there are no pressures to perform or conform to a corporate style. There is no threat of redundancy or loss of pay review either. You get what you put in.</P>

    <H3>Twyford Down</H3>
    <P>My work specialises in environmental and planning law litigation. Following a successful defence of two protesters against the international paper company, Scott (which produces Andrex). I was instructed to defend the protesters who were injuncted from protesting on and around Twyford Down between 1992 and 1993. I also prepared the defence to a claim for nearly 2 million by the Department of Transport which was aborted by the Department in 1995. The original case started with six defendants and expanded into a case with seventy six defendants. The injunction was fought on every point o domestic and European law. I prepared a case for the Court of Appeal for a member of a large trade union which was successful and important for protecting the right to protest. Two limbs of the injunction were discharged and the Department will shortly be paying costs.</P>
    <P>Throughout the Twyford campaign, the Lib Dems and the Labour party were active in their support for the protesters. Simon Hughes MP organised a successful press conference at the House of Commons, and MPs attended the Down to join the protesters. This high profile public support, including a debate in the House, was important for the campaign.</P>

    <H3>After Twyord - The Newbury Bypass</H3>
    <P>I was instructed to expose possible illegalities regarding the construction of the Newbury Bypass. Many people worked on this campaign. I exchanged correspondence with the European Commission and the government and at the end of 1994 the government was persuaded to conduct a review of the route. Protesters mistakenly thought they had won but that was far from the case. The road was back on the agenda by the end of June 1995 but the government was persuaded that the entire project had to be readvertised throughout Europe to satisfy the EC public procurement regulations. This was conceded and contracts were held up yet again for months.</P>
    <P>In January this year I successfully represented protesters from four camps in possession proceedings. Against counsel for the Department of Transport, I persuaded the junior Judge to adjourn the case to a full High Court Judge, thereby obtaining a significant breathing space for the protesters with their action. Regretfully, the first counsel instructed did not appear for the protesters. The case went ahead and was lost. I strongly advised against an appeal because experience has taught me when to recognise a fruitless effort. However, another team of lawyers went ahead with an appeal and lost. I consider this decision to have damaged the campaign although I can understand why other lawyers felt they wanted to contribute to such an important case.</P>
    <P>Of all the campaigns I have worked on, Newbury was the most fraught, disorganised and difficult I have encountered. The protesters did not pull together as a coherent group; many groups and indeed individuals had their own mini agendas which went in diverse directions and diffused energy in unproductive ways.</P>
    <P>The confusion amongst the Lib Dems was acute, for example. Here is a political party which has done some excellent environmental campaigning work on roads now being seen, in the form of the local MP David Rendell, to support roads policies associated with the Tories. Of course, there were valuable and sincere contributions from thousands of supporters and organisations. Friends of the Earth financed an office which was a vital nerve centre. There was financial support from groups like WWF UK and committed benefactors.</P>
    <P>But the energy came too late. The use of the law as a proactive and empowering tool was marginalised. The strength of the law relies upon well-planned early strategy. Environmental campaigning has to change, along with the courts and the politicians. There is a need for fresh ideas and more cohesive support which accommodates diversity of thought and expression but is firmly focused on the target for success. Early strategy may be seen as dull and lacking in heroic glamour but it has a higher success story. It is essential to respond in the early stages in planning law cases. Campaigns that win in a community have positive knock-on effects for years.</P>

    <H3>Skye Bridge</H3>
    <P>The benefits of a campaign for a community are illustrated in the current no toll Skye Bridge campaign. Clients from a group called Skye and Kyle against Tolls have asked me to advise on technical and European human rights issues. This time the Lib Dem MP, Charles Kennedy, is supporting the campaigners. So is the Highland Council.</P>
    <P>The tolls levied on the bridge, built through a public finance initiative (PFI), are so high that support for the protesters is drawn as far afield as the USA and New Zealand. I have been asked to comment on the case for the Wall Street Journal, amongst other papers. This contrasts with support in England which has thus far been poor. A return fare to cross the 570 metre bridge in the high season is 75.00; for an HGV class 2 vehicle, 50.80; for a car 10.40. This contrasts with other bridges throughout the UK, some of which are longer and far grander and which have been built by finance from the public purse, where there are no tolls, or toll tariffs which average less than 2.00 for a return journey.</P>
    <P>The government has issued summonses against 176 non payers and hundreds more have been charged. This is curious given that the government is prosecuting for a private company in an action which would normally attract a civil remedy for breach of contract. I believe this to be constitutionally unacceptable. On 17 April Sheriff Cameron openly pronounced in court in Inverness that these cases should never come before his court. Various defendants who were unrepresented pleaded guilty for personal reasons, not least the cost of travelling to a court over 130 miles away from Skye. He refused to fine or sentence the offenders although found them technically guilty of a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>This contrasted with a view of Sheriff Fraser at a trial I attended in Dingwall on 11 April. He refused to hear any European law arguments, deeming them irrelevant. He fined a Mr. Anderson a total of 150 for five offences and ordered that the fine be collected by 'civil diligence' - or forcible removal of goods, a practice frowned upon by the High Court in London. He also indicated that all other defendants who came before him would be dealt with on the same basis. He added that he intended to increase the fine if they re-offended after 11 April.</P>
    <P>I have been instructed to advise on the human rights issues regarding the infringement of the right to respect for private and family life and entitlement to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal. The toll affects families who live between the island and the mainland who are unable to see each other regularly because they cannot afford the tariff. The protesters have also been refused legal aid and, as described above, have been dealt with by a biased tribunal on at least one occasion.</P>
    <P>I also believe there has been a breach of the EU Council Directive 93/89 regarding the maximum charges that can be imposed on toll bridges. I am pursuing this with the Commission. These are points that can be run in court via a request that the Scottish court refers the case to the European Court of Justice for an interpretation on the meaning of the Directive on a preliminary point of law.</P>
    <P>PFIs are said to bring fundamental changes to the way in which the public sector procures infrastructure projects. The purpose is to transfer the financial risk to the private sector. Scotland is frequently used as a political and legal laboratory for new government experiments, the Skye Bridge being the first PFI experiment. A remarkably bad choice, since the island of Skye is in one of the most deprived economic areas in Europe. The protest should be alerting the public in England and Wales to future government plans for PFIs this side of the border. Significantly, the government has announced that all English PFI projects will be joint venture projects. Has it anticipated that the Skye scheme, which is a financially free standing project might just be unacceptable to the English?</P>

   <H2>What A Waste</H2>
  </CENTER>
  <P>It would be rather ironic if the Liberal Democrats having waited nearly 80 years for a share of government, and Labour having waited 18 years to be in government, accomplished nothing in the way of constitutional change.</P>
  <P>But that must be a risk from the increasing obsession of both parties with referenda on reforms.</P>
  <P>Tony Blair last month caved in to entirely predictable Tory pressure and committed himself to referenda in Scotland and Wales before devolution is put to parliament. Paddy Ashdown, unlike most Liberal Democrats, was conspicuous in his refusal to condemn Blair's about-face.</P>
  <P>It now seems that the Liberal Democrats are moving towards supporting a Labour government from outside, retaining an independence which full coalition would destroy. That is good news.</P>
  <P>But the price allegedly being demanded is yet another referendum, on electoral reform. This is worth having only if Labour will commit itself in advance to support and campaign for an acceptable new system.</P>
  <P>Otherwise, a referendum which saw the Liberal Democrats and some minor parties pitted against combined Labour/Tory opposition would be a catastrophe. It would bury the issue for a generation.</P>
  <P>It starts to look as if a Labour government supported by Liberal Democrats would devote its entire five years to organising referenda. Quite apart from the likelihood of one on the European single currency, we already have referenda in sight on Scotland, Wales and electoral reform, possibly on the House of Lords, and maybe the English regions.</P>
  <P>Given each of these issues will take up huge amounts of parliamentary time, and given also the government would have to run the country in its spare moments, there is a depressingly high risk that this approach would ensure that nothing was done. This would be particularly acute if this great wodge of referenda drifted on, becoming giant opinion polls on a Government facing mid-term blues.</P>
  <P>It is argued by some that a 'yes' vote would entrench each reform against future Tory meddling.</P>
  <P>This is rubbish. Were the Tories to win again (something which five years of perpetual voting and lack of concrete results would make more likely) they would be able to claim a general election mandate for whatever they had campaigned to do.</P>
  <P>There is only one way to entrench these reforms, and that brings us back to electoral reform. The fairest systems are those which would ensure there is a never a Tory majority, or any majority government again.</P>
  <P>But can Labour be made to realise that its current popularity is mainly the result of public disgust with Tory incompetence and corruption, and that the experience of the last 18 years suggests that, long-term, the present system is no more in Labour's interest than that of any non-Tory party?</P>
  <HR>
  <H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Tabloids Lose 1-0</H2>
  <P>Are the British, and particularly the English, as xenophobic as the tabloid press and Tory Euro-sceptics hope? This is the first <IMG SRC="../name.gif" ALT="Liberator"> since the end of the Euro 96 football competition, and the first since the Government's climb-down from its ludicrous 'beef war'.</P>
  <P>These disparate events both suggest that the public is a good more sensible about Europe than many politicians are willing to credit. There was some disorder after key football matches, but nothing like the scale of violent nationalism feared beforehand.</P>
  <P>The Daily Mirror's odious 'soccer war' feature, far from appealing to its readers, damaged that paper's already battered reputation and public outrage forced a change of tone.</P>
  <P>Perhaps the far right-dominated Tory Eurosceptics, and SirJames Goldsmith's absurd Referendum Party, will find less fertile ground than they thought for their simplistic foreigner-hating.</P>
  <P>And so with the beef issue. Tory ministers raved about Brussels banning the export of beef products, even while Malcolm Rifkind was memorably unable to name a single country likely to wish to buy the stuff. European policies the Government might otherwise have supported were voted down, in the interests of tallow, gelatine and semen.</P>
  <P>The public, clearly, is less obsessed with semen than are the Tories. Nothing happened. The Tory poll rating remained obstinately where it was. The public knew perfectly well that BSE's cause is nothing to do with Brussels and everything to do with the Tories' dogmatic obsession with deregulation.</P>
  <P>There are dangers lurking in the Maastricht convergence criteria, but pro-European politicians need to take more risks to put their case. The public does not want to see Britain as a sweat-shop of ill-trained cheap labour for the rest of Europe, which is all the Eurosceptics offer.</P>

  <P>A recent speculative piece in the Independent on Sunday about the likelihood of the Liberal Democrats offering Labour a '10-year partnership' had the fingerprints of Alan Leaman, LibDem strategy director, and leading Ashdown advisor.</P>
  <P>Since these leaks are the only way most ordinary Liberal Democrats get to know if they are being sold to Tony Blair, and for how much, it is worth putting in context.</P>
  <P>For those who missed it, 'a Liberal Democrat source' said the country needed at least 10 years of non-Conservative government, and that the Liberal Democrats would not bring down a Blair government, though they might vote against individual policies. The country does indeed need at least 10 years of non-Conservative government, though this rather invites the question of how the Liberal Democrats would set about fighting the mid-point general election - as Labour's formal partner or not? The piece even stated that Paddy Ashdown favoured a semi-formal partnership, rather than a 'full-bloodied coalition'.</P>
  <P>If so, this is a considerable advance. Full coalition would destroy the Liberal Democrats as an independent party, neuter their influence in a hung parliament once the coalition was signed, and give them mere trappings and baubles in return (which would, however, undoubtedly be enough for some people).</P>
  <P>But what would the Liberal Democrats want in return for a 'semi-formal partnership'?</P>
  <P>The answer given was a referendum on electoral reform (see <A HREF="comment.htm">Commentary</A>).</P>
  <P>Ashdown has become so enamoured with referenda that it is hard to see how he could back down from holding one, even though, by the mid-term of the next parliament, it might become a referendum on the government's popularity rather than on the issue itself.</P>
  <P>The IoS story also attributed to the 'Liberal Democrat source' the view that Blair would need 10 years 'to transform the country'.</P>
  <P>But can a leader who fudges and evades all questions about what he would do, and who forever takes refuge in motherhood and apple pie generalities, seriously be considered to be in the business of 'transformation'?</P>
  <P>If Labour is to be pushed into even the most modest reforms, the Liberal Democrats will have to be regularly prodding Blair with sharpened sticks, not with warm words.</P>
  <P>And there is little sign of that. It is an open secret that many very senior figures are worried that negotiations may be taking place about a post-election relationship with Labour, and that they, let alone the rest of the party, are being given only scant information on this.</P>
  <P>Some activists fear that a deal with Labour might presented to the party on a 'take it or leave it' basis straight after the election, with minimal time for consultation and precious little room for post-election negotiation.</P>
  <P>But could a deal be sold to the country which could not be sold to the party at large, or even to a changed post-election parliamentary party?</P>

   <H2>Fit to Govern?</H2>
   <H3>by Leo McKinstry<BR>Bantam Press, 12.99.</H3>
  </CENTER>
  <P>Former Islington Labour councillor McKinstry, having belatedly recognised the true nature of the Labour party, reviews its personalities, organisation, policies and record when in power, and concludes that Labour is not, in the words of the title, fit to govern this country.</P>
  <P>This is a critique from a particular perspective, namely that the 'new Labour/Blairite' line is basically sound, but that behind it, fatally, there lurks the loony left and the p.c. Thought Police. Reflecting McKinstry's own sudden conversion from convinced Socialist to conviction Conservative, there is an underlying assumption that market forces must reign supreme and any form of public spending or social regulation is a Bad Thing, of course, the dichotomy between the right wing policy and left wing ideology of Labour <I>is</I> a fatal flaw; but any Liberal must find the Daily Mail - style pronouncements of Blair, Straw et al, abhorrent in principle; and one almost finds oneself in sympathy with Labour left-wingers quoted here who disagree with them.</P>
  <P>But the book provides ample evidence to support its central theme - the awesome chasm between the words of the Blairistas and the words and actions of the rest of the Labour party. Few of the examples of hypocrisy, obfuscation double-dealing and veniality quoted in this book are new, but seldom can so many have been gathered together to such devastating effect. Scarcely any aspect of Labour's Programme for government is free from contradiction - spending pledges are unrelated to revenue-raising commitments, and the entire ethos of the party - as evidenced by its performance in local government - runs counter to every plank of the Blairite platform.</P>
  <P>Although clearly written and produced at some speed (and why the hell isn't there an index?) it is highly readable, topical and illuminated with some entertaining anecdotes. The sections on internal party groups and Labour party phraseology are especially recommended.</P>
  <P>The depressing thing about this book, however, is the thought that the moral putrefaction and monumental incompetence of the present Government are such that a majority of voters are likely to conclude that they are even less fit to govern than the subjects of this book. McKinstry's satisfaction will be to have been proved right; there won't be much comfort for the rest of us.</P>

  <P><B><I>Revolutionary Liberalism fights its way back onto Liberator's cover. Stewart Rayment explains why.</I></B></P>
  <HR WIDTH=50%>
  <P><B>Early in July the inquest on Srebrenica brought a flood of images back to our newspapers</B>, with tales of French/UN betrayal adding poignancy to the atrocities. The woman who hanged herself on hearing the news of the fall is particularly memorable.</P>
  <P>Why do these images keep coming before us? Will humanity never learn? Are not the memories of miseries enough? Are there not sufficient teachers to keep them to mind and hold our hands from such folly?.</P>
  <P>There are, too many even; but humanity never learns. Perhaps some of the finest and strongest examples are in the work of Francisco de Goya, born in Fuendetodos, Aragon in 1746, 250 years ago. He died in exile amongst fellow Liberales in Bordeaux in 1828.</P>
  <P>Apocryphally we are told that Goya began his drawings of the Peninsular War (1808-1814) the day after Napoleon's General Murat ordered shootings of civilians in reprisal for the rising of May 2nd in Madrid. A servant asked the artist, long established as the leading court painter of his day, 'Why do you paint these barbarities that men commit?". "To tell men that they should not be barbarians", Goya replied.</P>
  <P>The French revolutionary wars awakened Liberalism in much of Europe. Spain was no exception, but Napoleonic games meant something else, not least double dealing with the monarchy. Spanish Liberales, many of whom would have looked positively towards France, found themselves caught between an all too clear imperialism on the one side and their own ultra-conservatives, Holy Inquisition and all, on the other. Whilst putting themselves at the front of resistance to the French (with whom they might at first have worked) they could never been sure of when the priests might launch the rabble upon them. This ambivalence is captured in the Disasters.</P>
  <P>The war went backwards and forwards, neither side able to consolidate itself it seems; as civil war and guerrilla war as well as the conventional this is hardly surprising. Spain's erstwhile ally, Great Britain could prove as rapacious as the French, and the Duke of Wellington was predictably no friend of the Liberales. However the Constitution of 19th March 1812 is a bench mark in Liberalism and remained an inspiration into the revolutions of 1820 and 1836. This Constitution proclaimed the sovereignty of the nation and said that the people alone were entitled to enact the fundamental laws of the country. Its representative organ the Cortes, was to be elected every two years under universal manhood suffrage, without any property qualification. Rather ahead of its time in the European context. Circumstances favoured the return of progressives to the first Cortes and these grouped together as Liberales, the first such party to assume that name. Although not in the majority, with the aid of representatives from the Americas the Liberales were able to carry many constitutional measures, but lost on the economic front where the Americans tend to vote with the Serviles. At the end of the day it was the bayonet beside the monarchy which determined the issue.</P>
  <P>Aldous Huxley commenting during the Second World</P>
  <P>War wrote of the Disasters:</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>"War always weakens and often completely shatters the crust of customary decency which constitutes a civilisation. It is a thin crust at the best of times and beneath it lies - what? Look through Goya's Desastres to find out. The abyss of bestiality and diabolism and suffering seems almost bottomless. There is practically nothing of which human beings are not capable when war or revolution or anarchy gives them the necessary opportunity and excuse; and to their pain death alone imposes a limit... His concern is exclusively with war as it affects the civilian population, with armies disintegrated into individual thieves and ravishers, tormentors and executioners - and occasionally, when the guerilleros have won a skirmish, into individual victims tortured in their turn and savagely done to death by avengers of their own earlier atrocities".</BLOCKQUOTE></P>
  <P>Huxley is generally correct; maybe Agustina of Aragon, a solitary women firing a cannon at the siege of Saragossa speaks of glories, though its starkness decries them, even capturing the pathos of such heroism. A man of few words, Goya captions this 'What Courage'. Short pithy captions are the mark of the Disasters. 'Why', 'One can't look', 'Charity' - a mass grave, and so on. Such economy heightens the terror of the images. I have a feeling that Goya's black images are not the product of a deranged mind, especially the later Disasters and Capricios, but as deliberate and rational as any other of his works.</P>
  <P>Goya did not dare publish the Disasters in his lifetime. After the 1820 revolution he fled to France, an old man, deaf and losing his sight. The plates were entrusted to his friend, the Liberal publisher Bermudez and finally appeared in the 1860s. In the Nineteenth century the Romantic mind paled in terror before these images. Baudelaire and Huysmans were amongst there champions. They are one of the most potent icons of the inhumanity of humanity and an essential ingredient of everyone's education.</P>

  <HR WIDTH=50%>
  <H3>Additional Powers</H3>
  <P>The Prevention of Terrorism (Additional Powers) Act was rushed through Parliament in one day, on Tuesday 2 April (or 24 hours and 47 minutes to be precise). In the House of Commons the allocation of time for the Bill was debated at 3.43 p.m., the Second Reading took place at 10.10 p.m., the Third Reading at 1.21 a.m. on Wednesday morning, and the Bill completed its passage through the House of Lords at 4.30 p.m. the same day. The Opposition acquiesced in the Bill being rushed through Parliament by the Government. The legislation allows the police to search clothing following the exercise of random stop and search powers, for which no reasonable grounds are required, and provides for searches of non-residential premises (such as a series of lock-up garages, or a lorry park) on a warrant issued by a justice of the peace. It also permits searches of any goods on accompanied or unaccompanied vehicles entering or leaving Great Britain or Northern Ireland, and provides a power to impose a police cordon and for the application of parking prohibitions and restrictions. The stop and search powers were the most controversial feature of the legislature, as potentially involving the greatest interference with individual liberty. But, due to the guillotine only Clause 1 of the Bill, on the stop and search powers, was actually considered by the House of Commons in Committee. One instance example of the problems of emergency legislation passed in haste.</P>
  <P>The 1996 Act was rushed through Parliament just two weeks after the renewal of the PTA itself. The political reasons for so doing have been a matter of fierce contention. One reason put forward was the approach of the 80th anniversary of the republican Easter Rising in Dublin in 1916. This led Earl Russell to comment "We are told that it is the 80th Anniversary of the Easter rising. I should exaggerate if I said that we have had 80 years' notice of that, but I should not exaggerate very much." (Lord Russell was described as 'infantile' by a not amused Earl Ferrers). It appears that the only reason the Bill can have been rushed through when it was, was to embarrass the Labour Party twice within two weeks, a trap which Jack Straw gleefully led the Labour Party into. It was noticeable that the most intelligent and comprehensive analysis of the legislation came from the Labour left, most notably former Northern Ireland spokesperson, Kevin McNamara. Both MPs and peers (including very effective contributions by Lord Rodgers) called for the legislation to be given full parliamentary scrutiny as soon as possible. The Liberal Democrats, to their credit, opposed the bill being rushed through Parliament, with Alan Beith and others strongly opposing the abuse of the Parliamentary process. However, as reported by Nick Brown in Liberator 237, the Liberal Democrats got their priorities entirely wrong - opposing the procedure, but not opposing the attacks on civil liberties. There may be very good reasons for some of the legislation, (such as the power to impose police cordons - so vital in saving lives in Manchester), there are equally certainly flaws in the legislation as well.</P>
  <H3><IMG SRC="ireland.jpg" ALIGN=RIGHT>Major Flop</H3>
  <P>The rushing through of the emergency legislation does more than embarrass Her Majesty's Opposition, or show up logical inconsistency in the Lib Dem approach to Liberty. It shows up far more fundamentally the washed up policy of the Government that must take a large part of the responsibility, in reality, for the end of the ceasefire. Nothing can justify the end of the ceasefire. Nothing can justify atrocities like the bombs in Manchester and at Canary Wharf. Most of all nothing can excuse a small band of terrorists shattering the hopes of millions of people in the north-eastern counties of Ireland. But the Government must take the political blame. The Government did nothing to dismantle emergency legislation throughout the months of ceasefire, but instead used the end of the ceasefire as an excuse to rush through even more draconian measures (that hadn't been required in the previous twenty years). The Government did nothing to show the terrorists that they were achieving anything through peace - no end to exclusion orders, painfully slow movement on the release of prisoners. Yes, many troops were removed and patrolling ended, a returning to normality for the people of the area, but more needed to be done. Whether this criminal idleness was due to some secret deal with the Ulster Unionists to shore up John Major's ailing majority, or whether it was just down to crass stupidity, we will never know. One thing, though, is certain. John Major's place in the history books was secure. Apart from a footnote for replacing Margaret Thatcher, John Major was assured an historic role in possibly bringing peace. Now he has thrown that away - the one really worthwhile thing he might have done - for being too cautious to take chances for the risk of peace. Even talks without preconditions should have been tried - for the sake of peace.</P>
  <P>Recent events in Portadown remind one of the astonishing and bigoted attitude of Unionist politicians. A year previously at Portadown - what was 'the Reverend' Ian Paisley's response to the ceasefire: to incite Orangemen to march and riot. Astounding. It is understandable that unionists felt threatened. The withdrawal of troops, while the Provisional IRA retained all its weapons, and the horrific terrorist 'punishment' attacks continued daily, must understandably have left many anxious. Unionist politicians, though, should have behaved responsibly.</P>
  <H3>Orangemen</H3>
  <P>Events at Portadown may appear bemusing to many outside people. Why the Orangemen want to march may appear something of a mystery. They may even appear somewhat harmless - like Morris men. After all, wanting to process down the street doesn't seem like much to ask. Many of their supporters made eloquent and reasonable sounding speeches about exercising their right to walk down the Queen's Highway. This might appear to be a demand to exercise a very basic civil liberty. But that is not the case when that 'right' has been used for well over a century - and throughout the years of the se8an Stormont Parliament -to demonstrate that Unionists were in control, and to show to Catholics that they were second class citizens in their own country. The marches have been used throughout this century to demonstrate Unionist domination, and to intimidate Catholic populations. This was affirmed by the decision of the Chief Constable of the RUC to hand over to the Orangemen at Drumcree. In stopping the march initially, and calling in the troops for backup, the Chief Constable must greatly have increased his force's credibility with nationalists. to then capitulate in response to Loyalist roadblocks and disorder, (and unknown possible political pressure) was a disaster. I am a fervent supporter of non-violent direct action - but what we saw in the 6 counties was the sinister underlying threat of violence and intimidation.</P>
  <P>It has been suggested that Catholics should in this day simply ignore the marches, and turn their backs (as indeed was done in one instance in Derry last year - orchestrated possibly by Sinn Fein). This would undoubtedly be a mature approach - to let the Orangemen march, surrounded by their history, and simply ignore them. (And leave the world asking why the men in bowler hats march - whether it be in Liverpool or Belfast). But it is very hard to ask people to do this when that history has been founded, in the not too distant past, on Protestant domination of Catholics. Once again Ireland seems bedeviled by its adherence to history. So what solution is there to the problem of the marches? Certainly not a policing one given the behaviour of the RUC. The only solution can be a community-based one - and that has to involve dialogue and compromise between both communities.</P>
  <H3>The Peace Process</H3>
  <P>So, what of the peace process? The Government has been dragging all along. The precondition on talks was a disgrace - they had a duty to talk if it might have stopped any violence. The rejection of the Mitchell report - a major propaganda boost for Provisional Sinn Fein (when Sinn Fein would have found it very difficult to accept the report anyway), forcing elections, which tells us no more than we knew anyway, and then barring one of the democratically elected parties. The 'peace process' may now be irretrievably broken down. Loyalist terrorists may or may not have been responsible (perhaps unofficially) for the murder of a Catholic taxi driver. A republican faction may or may not have been responsible for the bombing of a hotel in Enniskillen. If the Loyalist ceasefire is allowed to come to an end, that will be the greatest crime of the Prime Minister. The loyalists have held their ceasefire for 6 months after the PIRA resumed their murderous campaign (albeit not foolish enough to renew it in northern Ireland itseL9. I would never have a good word for Loyalist 'paramilitaries' with their indiscriminate and deadly incompetent trail of murder and killing, but the spokespeople of the loyalist fringe parties, Gary McMichael of the Ulster Democratic Party (linked to the UDA), and David Ervine of the Progressive Unionist Party (linked to the UVE3 and the real stars of the ceasefire. Both men have made a great impact with their reasoned speeches and constructive contributions to the process. Once the PIRA was ended, John Major should have made sure to hold the Loyalist ceasefire - by releasing loyalist prisoners. Prisoners are influential in the terrorist movements. Releases could have been made conditional, and always been revoked in the violence had been resumed. But loyalist prisoners should have been released. The Government can still do this. It can still also play the prisoner card to show willingness to Sinn Fein.</P>
  <H3>Sinn Fein</H3>
  <P>The Govemment's inactivity has been unforgivable, but they can still try and rectify their mistakes. It is in this spirit that the Government was right to meet the loyalist delegations at 10 Downing Street. Even, John Major was right to shake hands with the convicted murderer. There may be questions about why he has ever been released at all (likewise it is debatable whether terrorist murderers should be part of any 'political' releases), but given that he had, the Prime Minister was right to meet him. Reconciliation is needed all round. Else, in the words of David Ervine, Northern Ireland may be on the road 'to hell and back.'</P>

  <P>Is there any less honest political project under way in Britain today than 'new' Labour?</P>
  <P>There are political projects which are more evil or misguided, but there is a peculiar brazenness about Labour's willingness to see what the opinion polls and tabloids are saying, and then meekly follow it.</P>
  <P>Liberal Democrat relations with Labour matter because key figures in the party have said and done enough to make the issue a live one for the media, but not enough to resolve it either for voters or their own somewhat bemused members.</P>
  <P>Sooner or later Tony Blair's attempt to fool all of the people all of the time will come unstuck. When it does, those identified with it will suffer at the public's hands.</P>
  <P>Trying to pin down what a 'new' Labour Britain would be like, is akin to wrestling with a jellyfish. Each time there appears to be something firm to hold onto, it slips away.</P>
  <P>Labour's commitments on social security benefits, pensions, rights at work, the future of the railways, and devolution have all been fudged out of meaningful existence.</P>
  <P>Labour refuses to say whether public spending will rise, while giving the vague impression that it will, but magically without any tax increases, (a subject on which the Liberal Democrats have been admirably honest). Its environmental policies are vague and of low priority.</P>
  <P>On civil liberties, Jack Straw's every utterance shows he would be as big a menace as is Michael Howard, arguable more so since defenders of civil liberties are at least on their guard when the Tories are in office.</P>
  <P>But hardly a week goes by without some hint about Liberal Democrats working with Labour in future, if not from Paddy Ashdown himself, then from 'senior sources. Most guilty of all are the old Jenkinsites whose continual praise of Labour goes without reprimand.</P>
  <P>It is an open secret that there is nervousness in parliament and among national officers that the Liberal Democrats will have a post-election deal with Labour sprung on them to take or leave. One problem is a generalised suspicion that something is going on, which has not been either answered or denied.</P>
  <P>The perception, true or otherwise, of the Liberal Democrats' stance towards Labour, will turn more votes, divert more campaigners' time and fill more of the airwaves than any issue of Liberal Democrat policy.</P>
  <P>Those  in authority who have kept raising this issue without resolving it can hardly now claim that it is all an invention by the media.</P>
  <P>At conference time last year, Liberator argued that the Liberal Democrats could sustain a Labour government in office, but only on issue-by-issue support, in return for clear concessions, and by retaining their own status outside government as an independent party.</P>
  <P>We argued that a formal coalition menaces the Liberal Democrats' ability to survive as a separate party because they would be linked inextricably with Labour. They would have  responsibility without power, forever having to threaten to destroy the coalition to exert any weight. Sadly, nothing has moved on, and this point must be made again.</P>
  <HR>
  <H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Postmen's Knockers</H2>
  <P>The world appeared to have turned upside down when the Liberal Democrats backed the postal workers' grievances in the summer, while Labour muttered and evaded when asked about its stance.</P>
  <P>But things have only reverted to a past in which Liberals were by no means as lukewarm towards trade unions as the Liberal Democrats have been, and Labour tried to stamp on any strike which might embarrass it electorally.</P>
  <P>The Liberal Democrats demand for the postal workers to share in their employers' profits was a welcome return of the Liberal principle of employees sharing in the fruits of their productivity. At this rate, the Liberal Democrats will start reviving the abandoned Liberal agenda of employee participation in management, and co-ownership, both ditched through a combination of fear, ignorance and hostility sometime in the Alliance era.</P>
  <P>The Post Office was a particularly good example to choose. Until the latest bout of strikes, which have anyway been managed from behind by the Government, it has been a standing reproach to those who insist that the private sector is always superior to the public sector.</P>
  <P>It has also been a reproach to those who use as their excuse for inaction on the continuing scandal of the utilities, the claim that "ownership does not matter". Which would most people say has been better run, the Post Office or British Gas? Which has served its customers better, the Post Office or the water companies?</P>
  <P>It was also cheering to see that one of the postal workers' objections was to trendy management fads, in this case under the name 'team working'. The 1990s employee knows that the slogans spouted by employers and politicians about 'empowerment', 'flatter structures', and 'business re-engineering' all mean job losses and harder work for the survivors, when translated into English. It is good to see one group of workers rebelling against this trend.</P>

  <P>If the Liberal Democrats have any judgement they will find who dreamt up the Take Courage slogan, bind and gag them, and confine them to a dungeon until the general election is over.</P>
  <P>The slogan adorns conference agendas and supporting documents and, worst of all, is to form the backdrop for the conference podium. Its subtext 'for the future' is merely political clich.</P>
  <P>'Take Courage' is an even worse slogan than the infamous 'One More Heave' used in October 1974. That at least required a mildly warped turn of mind to extract the double meaning.</P>
  <P>As anyone old enough to have read or heard an advertisement during the last 30 years or so will know, 'Take Courage' was the slogan of Courage beers. As such, it became one of the best-known advertising slogans ever.</P>
  <P>Everyone we tried out the new LibDem slogan on, LibDem member or not, reacted with horrified disbelief, usually adding a remark to the effect of "you're joking" or "they must be mad", or even "they must have been drunk".</P>
  <P>But even if Take Courage were not a famous beer advertisement, it would still be a dire political slogan.</P>
  <P>The words Take Courage are ordinarily used as encouragement to someone about to undergo an ordeal, a risky medical operation, or a difficult examination, for example.</P>
  <P>The whole underlying message is, "a vote for the Liberal Democrats is a vote for policies which will be unpleasant and possibly dangerous, but for your own good if they succeed, so hold your nerve and vote for some necessary but nasty medicine."</P>
  <P>In how many key seats has the party's private polling identified statistically significant numbers of masochists among the electorate?</P>
  <P>Even more worrying for Liberal Democrat members should be the process by which this slogan was chosen.</P>
  <P>Members of the conference committee were not told about Take Courage until it was fixed in late July. Nor did the campaign committee know, nor more than a handful, it would appear, of the MPs.</P>
  <P>The conference communications committee, which brings together conference organisers, campaign organisers and the party's media specialists, first heard of it at its July meeting. It was received with general horror, but members were told they could not even discuss the matter.</P>
  <P>There followed a series of trenchant messages to Paddy Ashdown warning that adorning the conference with an old beer slogan would make his party look ridiculous and overshadow other conference business.</P>
  <P>By mid-August, ALDC members had started to attack the slogan on Cix, the LibDems electronic mail system. In less than a week, more than 100 derogatory messages were recorded.</P>
  <P>At this point, Paddy Ashdown felt obliged to reply. He admitted: "It could be made fun of because of connections with Courage Beer, though this is pretty old now and will be remembered best by, chiefly, men of a 'certain age'. This will no doubt amuse the sketch writers. But we are not speaking to the jaded press corps and political cognoscenti. We are speaking to the British people...the chief concern at the moment is to ensure that the public know what we stand for (not just policies but what kind of party we are and what role we can play. Distinctiveness is vital if we are to continue to resist the squeeze)."</P>
  <P>He went on to note concerns, "that we are saying subliminally that you must have courage to vote LibDem. Frankly, this risk was more of a worry. But we believe we can put it across in ways which don't indicate that".</P>
  <P>Ashdown then explained his thinking about the slogan's meaning, which we reproduce here in full. Further comment is unnecessary.</P>
  <P>"What is Take Courage For The Future: a reaffirmation of our commitment to a better Britain, and to the basic values of the British people; a statement of Liberal Democrat support for the instincts and patriotism of the British people; an expression of Liberal    Democrat self-confidence; a declaration of optimism for Britain and for the role of the Liberal Democrats; an encouragement to millions of people to take heart and to have the courage of their convictions with a vote for the Liberal Democrats; confirmation that Liberals Democrats are prepared to be open and clear about where they stand on key issues, that Liberal Democrats will be honest about the challenges that need to be dealt with.</P>
  <P>"What take Courage For The Future is not: not a challenge to the electorate to be either brave or foolhardy; not an incitement to Liberal Democrats to be left-wing; not a signal that Liberal Democrat policies are risky or frightening; not an endorsement of Courage bitter".</P>
  <P>Strange to relate, several months ago Lord Holme picked 'Take Courage' as his horse in LDYS' Night at the Races conference fund-raiser.</P>

   <H2>The Liberal Democrats</H2>
   <H3>ed. Don MacIver<BR>Prentice Hall / Harvester Wheatsheaf, 1996, 16.50.</H3>
  </CENTER>
  <P>This book is the first major book-length study of the Liberal Democrats, comprising eleven chapters written by "a group of professional political scientists" at "British universities" (though one contributor - Duncan Brack - is actually neither).</P>
  <P>Some of the chapters have a familiar ring to them - the local elections expert duo of Thrasher and Rallings on Lib Dem election results, Michael Steed (former Liberal Party president) on the Liberal tradition and John Curtice, with others, on what Liberal Democrat members are like. However, even those readers who are already familiar with the writing of these people will find some interesting new pieces of information, and will doubtless find the bringing together in one volume of so many contributions convenient.</P>
  <P>The first four chapters, on the development of the party, are largely a fairly standard, but well-written, recount of how the 'third force' mutated from Liberals to Alliance and finally Lib Dems. Much of the novel information in this section is in Duncan Brack's chapter on the development of policy. This  makes an elegant and clearly argued case for seeing Lib Dems as having a clear ideological focus, and consistent, relevant policies. That he was the party's policy director for much of the period may encourage a cynic to think, "He would say that, wouldn't he?" but he does highlight weakness too, including quoting from his former deputy Ben Rich's disparaging of the policy process in a Liberator article (Liberator<D> 227).</P>
  <P>The middle third of the book examines the party's structure in some detail. Some of the comments seem to suffer from authors having a better acquaintance with newspaper cuttings than with the personalities involved. For example, when the power of the President is described, no mention is made of Charles Kennedy's own personality. Describing all the meetings a President is entitled to attend gives a rather bloated picture of the post's power, when an incumbent like Kennedy often had such a dismal record at turning up. Also, it is not clear whether the party organisation chart that shows no link of accountability between Conference Committee and Conference Office is a mistake or an astute comment!</P>
  <P>As a member of Conference Committee, I found the descriptions of Conference  particularly interesting. There were only one or two occasions when I felt like screaming, "No, it wasn't like that." Despite the apparent reliance on newspaper reports of conference, many of the judgements are much fairer than one would otherwise expect and, unlike other books and articles, this volume does draw attention to, for example, the poor judgement and myopia of much of the Parliamentary Party during the 1994 Brighton Conference.</P>
  <P>The analysis of party members will confirm many people's prejudices, with Lib Dem activists being found to be more likely to deliver leaflets and less likely to attend meetings than Labour activists. Also, substantial proportions of the membership dissent from party policy on European and (English) devolution.</P>
  <P>The last four chapters consider the electoral success, or otherwise, of the Liberal Democrats. It includes an intriguing suggestion from John Curtice that, after considering who votes for which party, "the Liberal Democrats emerge as a liberal party, not a centre party" and, as Labour moves towards the centre, he suggests there is fruitful scope for the Liberal Democrats as a liberal and left-of-centre party to outflank Labour on such issues as support for the welfare state and government spending.</P>
  <P>Some of the discussion about party strategy is a little superficial, without any real consideration of what 'replacing Labour' actually means. In practice, this has often meant replacing Labour as the principal opponent in much of the south and south-west of England. However, what this may produce in the future is a parliament full of Labour MPs, with a much reduced number of Tories and a substantial number of Lib Dem MPs. This would be a somewhat odd outcome for a 'replacing Labour' strategy.</P>
  <P>In all, much fruitful reading with plenty of thought-provoking comments. The only real flaw is some poor proof-reading. There are many minor typographical errors, but also at least one more serious one (not only is one constituency wrongly identified, but the   footnote giving the source itself has an error in the page number referred to).</P>

   <H2>Part Of The Unions?</H2>
  </CENTER>
  <P><B><I>Liberal Democrats have been wrongly suspicious of trade unions. But if they looked, they would find union members are much like them, and that the Liberal Democrat Trade Unionists are preparing workplace campaigns, says ALDTU secretary Andrew Hudson.</I></B></P>
  <HR WIDTH=50%>
  <P>From the merger until the 1992 election, campaigning within the Liberal Democrats for a better understanding of trade unions was ALDTU's priority. While the party cannot be regarded as hostile towards trade unions, it could certainly have been accused of being agnostic towards them. The experience of ALDTU members on policy working parties was that many party members were unconvinced of the benefits of trade union membership. This may be due to the party hierarchy containing a large number of middle-class professionals who do not appreciate that, for many people, advancement comes largely through collective action. There are also some doubts about the compatibility of collective rights and individual rights.</P>
  <P>The first employment policy paper Citizens At Work demonstrated why ALDTU faced an uphill struggle. Worker participation schemes were regarded as a panacea which would make trade unions obsolete. This was followed by a Youth and Student Charter which contained quite a bit about animal rights but nothing about employment rights, and supported free market economics.</P>
  <P>These papers' errors of omission were followed by the notorious economics paper Economics For The Future, which committed the party to support decentralised pay bargaining and opposed minimum wage legislation.</P>
  <P>At Harrogate in 1992, ALDTU proposed a motion calling for a rethink of the party's approach to trade unions, and for a policy paper which looked again at decentralised bargaining and minimum wage legislation. It was passed overwhelmingly, despite some opposition from the federal policy committee.</P>
  <P>ALDTU was given representation on the resulting working group. It was able to play a key role in ensuring that the final draft was largely welcomed by the TUC. ALDTU had helped change the party's attitude to unions into a positive one.</P>
  <P>At the same time, a dtente was initiated between the party and the TUC, largely by the then employment spokesman Alex Carlile.</P>
  <P>In September 1994, the federal conference adopted the employment working group's paper Working For Change, which treated national wage bargaining with an open mind, as it did public sector pay. Conference also accepted minimum wage legislation through a minimum hourly rate determined by a Low Pay Commission.</P>
  <P>Tony Blair is one of our best allies with his hands-off approach to trade unions. Although we would not seek to replace Labour's union links with an equally incestuous alternative arrangement, we are now in a position where the TUC general secretary John Monks can admit that the Liberal Democrats have signed up to as much of the TUC's agenda as Labour has. Only the more blockheaded Labour supporters can really believe they are going to get any special favours for trade unions from a Blair-led Labour Party, whose leader appears not only to want to distance himself from the unions, but who seems to have no appreciation of the historical reasons which resulted in those links in the first place.</P>
  <P>There are, regrettably, still people in our party who see trade unions as alien entities best abandoned to Labour. Policy working groups still produce reports displaying an ignorance of trade unions.</P>
  <P>For example, the party's recent part-time workers' guarantee suggested that employers could implement the policy without waiting for legislation. A party that believes in empowering people should not seek to rely on the generosity of employers who have so far shown little sign of it on other issues.</P>
  <P>There is no conflict between trade union membership and individual rights. With the abolition of the closed shop, trade unions are voluntary organisations which can and do support individual rights.</P>
  <P>Working For Change correctly calls for a framework of employment rights; but there is a   vast difference between having rights enshrined in law and exercising those rights. Access to the law can be expensive.</P>
  <P>One of the great trade union success stories of the 1990s has been increasing amount of compensation won at tribunals for those injured at work.</P>
  <P>ALDTU's next tasks will be widening support for the Liberal Democrats within trade unions. To do this effectively it needs to reach a critical mass of members.</P>
  <P>Ironically, the average Liberal Democrat member is not all that different to the average trade unionist. Labour force surveys show that trade union membership is now strongest among professional and managerial workers. There are more trade unions affiliated to the TUC which are not also affiliated to Labour than are.</P>
  <P>The workplace is an area where liberals can participate in community politics through trade union activities. The shop steward is the local community activist campaigning, lobbying, representing their community in negotiations with the employer, and representing individuals by taking up casework.</P>
  <P>Union activity might particularly appeal to those in the public sector who suffer restrictions on their party political activity. Perhaps not surprisingly, the largest concentration of ALDTU members is in the public sector union Unison.</P>
  <P>With the increasing growth of the global economy, the trade union movement offers one of the few channels by which ordinary people can organise to counteract the multi-nationals. ALDTU will strive to raise within the party the plight of trade unionists in other parts of the world who are deprived of their basic rights. Judging by the debate on world trade in the party, this will not be a pushover.</P>

  </CENTER>
  <P><B><I>Tim Beaumont argues that Green Liberal Democrats need to determine whether they are environmentalists or ecologists</I></B></P>
  <HR WIDTH=50%>
  <P>It is common ground, I take it, among all Greens of whatever shade that we are embarked on a paradigm shift, in that the world has reached "The Limits of Growth" and must in future live sustainably or not live at all. And it is so much accepted that the Governments of the world have gone on record as accepting this, whether they really understood what they were saying or not.</P>
  <P>And it therefore is not surprising, given that we are in a paradigm shift, that all British political parties are in a turmoil even if the symptoms of some of their present schizophrenias do not appear to have an overtly green tinge.</P>
  <P>For instance, the present surface schizophrenia of the so-called Conservative party is about Europe, but the undergoing malaise goes back to the moment when Baldwin looked at the Backbenchers in the twenties and saw the rows of "hard-faced men who had done well out of the war". Those men (few women) provided the seedbed for the neo-Liberalism of Margaret Thatcher and Sir Keith Joseph and for the gradual but wholesale ousting of the squirearchy, the Gilmours, the Whitelaws and the Priors, to the House of Lords.</P>
  <P>That squirearchy, of whom my father was one, would have been able to adapt to "the sustainable revolution" particularly if they were, as they could have been, the ones who were sustained. The present party can probably not so adapt and its future is beyond the scope of this address and possibly of coherent prediction.</P>
  <P>The Labour party also suffers from schizophrenia. It was from the beginning rooted in an alliance between Trade Unionists who had not much time for ideology and ideologists who despised Trades Unionists, for much the same mix of social and ideological reasons that the Social Democrats despise the Liberals. Once again the present schizophrenia has not much to do with Greenery, being between pragmatists on the one hand and an unholy alliance of differing nostalgias on the other. Once again the old set up could have produced a viable Green movement, based on the dreams of William Morris and the practicality of Jesse Collings. Once again the wrong side lost, or to put it in suitably dialectical terms, both thesis and antithesis vanished and the synthesis has turned out to be incompatible with the realities of today.</P>
  <P>Confronted with a situation like this, the student of politics obviously looks for a similar schizophrenia in the Liberal Democrat Party. We can, I think, shrug off the most obvious recent place of fissure, the Liberal/Social Democrat alliance, where David Owen has expelled himself and the rest of the Social Democrats have, in my judgement, been slowly  ingested by the Liberals, like a boa-constrictor's lunch. No, once again we have to go back to an earlier situation to see the fault lines, back, even before Asquith/Lloyd George to a basic split between Whigs and Radicals where Whigs firmly represented the new manufacturing interests and Free Trade, which meant cheap food for the urban voter. And Radicals did not represent any distinct ideology but were, to their credit, seriously interested in democracy, which Whigs, when they thought of it at all, were against (which was why Disraeli was able to dish them).</P>
  <P>But the rebirth of the Liberal Party under Jo Grimond gave birth to a new eclectic Party which was ripe for Greenery. There were plenty, of whom I was not one, who saw that there was danger in this and who, like Michael Meadowcroft and Gordon Lishman, pleaded for a basic "Liberal Philosophy", but they, for reasons which I will not go into now, lost out and so the party has come happily blundering along into the situation which exists today where it really does not understand the seriousness of some of the problems which confront it.</P>
  <P>"What is the problem?", we ask. "We are all in favour of the countryside, and animals; The Green Pressure Groups give us good marks (with only slight reservations) and Sutton & Richmond and "that authority in the South-East with a new rather green name" win all  the awards for Green administration. Is not everything in the garden (which we will quickly create in some urban setting and win a commendation for) lovely?"</P>
  <P>And my answer to you is sadly: "No". And it will not be lovely until we have faced up to at least three important questions. The first is: "Are we Environmentalists or Ecologists?". The second follows directly on and involves facing up to the fact, so unpalatable to Liberals, that if we are ecologists, we have to be much more Protectionists than we are Free Traders, and the third means a lot of hard graft in working out a philosophy as to what power should reside at what level. The last will become very important in thinking at the international level but also rears its ugly head in matters like the Newbury and Salisbury bypasses.</P>
  <P>How does it happen that a group of Liberal Democrat councillors and a Liberal Democrat MP can end up being reviled by all the Greens with whom we are allied? Matthew Taylor, I think put his finger on how it happened. A group of people who know all about NIMBY, did not recognise the related disease OIMBY (Only In My Back Yard: i.e. we are against building roads and will oppose other peoples bypasses to the death if they are environmentally damaging, but this is a special case and it is a special case because the people concerned say that it is a special case.) In other words Greenery meets Community Politics: which is the most important? At what level do we seek to give power in what kind of cases. And that is one area which we in GLD should explore.</P>
  <P>And it is an example which impinges on the first question which I posed. Are we Ecological or Environmental? Have we  faced up to the fact that if we are to produce sustainable energy, we may have to have windfarms on the skyline of the Chilterns? Have we faced up to the fact that if we are to create an ecologically sustainable life for our overpopulated country  we will probably have to repopulate the countryside and in the process destroy most of what the Council for the Preservation of Rural England stands for. As far as the CPRE are concerned the Enclosures and the Clearings were doubtless regrettable, but they feel that we must start from where we are, must we not? After all, no one is trying to repopulate Germany with Jews!</P>
  <P>Have we faced up to the fact that our ecological footprint (the area of land which is needed to support us in the style to which we are accustomed) is much larger than the British Isles and that therefore we are, in the words R H Tawney applied to the rich, "a small class which wears several men's clothes, eats several men's dinners, occupies several families' houses and lives several men's lives"? Have we faced up to the fact that not only is Free Trade probably disastrous for the poorer classes in all except the richest countries, as Herman Daly, Oxfam, Christian Aid and probably all ecologists except Duncan Brack will agree, but also that any Trade at all is probably not a very good thing. "It is not true" as Chesterton pointed out, "that the most obvious thing for a man who has plucked an apple from an apple tree is to put it on a train and send it to the opposite side of England. The most obvious thing is to put it in his mouth." The most obvious place for supermarkets in the Vale of Evesham to get asparagus is from the Vale of Evesham but classical economics ensures that they only stock asparagus from Spain, with all the traffic and pollution that that involves.</P>
  <P>Above all have we faced up to the fact that the practical implications of ecological facts are that we have to become a party which will tell people not only that they are going to get poorer but that also that it is right that they should and morally wrong to do anything else (although we may correctly but confusingly add that everyone must become wealthy).</P>
  <P>To say that this is impossible for a party is not just to give up any hope of achieving a world which will be anything but a monstrous slum by the time our grandchildren are grown up, it is also to tell a lie because those of us who are old enough have lived through a time when those who governed us told us just that and were applauded for it. The causes of the defeat of the Tory party in 1945 were not to be found in wartime austerity, they were to be found in the classical economics of the thirties.</P>
  <P>But if we are to learn anything from that immensely important precedent, we must look at some of the things which made it work.</P>
  <P>Firstly, it could not have worked if the gap between rich and poor had not diminished and that means cropping the riches of the rich and diminishing the poorness of the poor in  order to achieve wealth for all.</P>
  <P>Secondly it could not have worked without a serious restriction of civil liberties. This does not mean that we have all got to become eco-fascists, appoint Jimmy Goldsmith as Dictator and bring in mass abortions like the Chinese. (We should note that the Socialist state of Kerala in India reduced its birthrate from a figure higher than China's to a figure lower than China's over the same period of time by purely democratic means.) But it will involve a move away from Libertarian Liberalism towards Community Liberalism, another subject which I commend to Liberal intellectuals for study. In rural terms for instance it means that we can campaign hard for granting access while rejecting "right to roam". The second will become more and more unthinkable as we use more and more of the countryside for intensive small scale farming as the demand for food increases (reference Worldwatch document Who will feed China? or even the "Foreign Affairs" reply, "Who will feed Africa?).</P>
  <P>Thirdly it involved people realising that the alternative to taking these steps was unacceptable and therefore making sure that all political parties co-operated in the task.</P>
  <P>And fourthly it involved people thinking that there was light at the end of the tunnel. But this time we are not going to offer a return to "normality"; we are going to have to offer a complete paradigm change from the quantitative heaven of the capitalist system to the qualitatively pleasurable human life offered by all the great religions and philosophers.</P>
  <P>It will not be easy; nothing is more daunting than a paradigm change seen in advance; but I suspect that it is not desperately painful in the process because if it is a true paradigm change, it is inevitable and therefore self-reinforcing. It is also a matter not so much of organisation and Shuttleworth, though I would be the last to pan that approach as of education and evangelism. and that surely is the game that the Liberal Democrat Greens are involved in.</P>
  <P>In any case I do not regard the prospect as any worse than I faced as a young Liberal on the morning after the 1950 election. "Who'll come a losing deposits with me?"  And, look we have come through!</P>

   <H2>Sleazy Does It</H2>
  </CENTER>
  <P>The eruptions of Tory sleaze during October provide not only copious reasons for a change of government, but for a change to the system of government.</P>
  <P>Supporters of constitutional reform have always been thwarted by public indifference. The public disgust with the revelations of the Hamilton/ Greer affair offers about the best climate possible to raise these issues, because the allegations go right to the heart of what is wrong the UK's governance.</P>
  <P>As Lord Russell set out in <A HREF="../239/index.htm"><IMG BORDER=0 SRC="../name.gif" ALT="Liberator"> 239</A>, the UK's government is now more centralised, and the theoretical separation of powers less effective, even than in the eighteenth century.</P>
  <P>Long-term one-party government, and a lack of effective checks on the limits of Cabinet power, create a climate in which corruption not only can flourish, but is almost certain to.</P>
  <P>One feature of British smugness has been the fond belief that the British system of government is the best yet devised, and that only benighted continentals suffer from legislators taking brown envelopes stuffed with banknotes, businesses buying favours and government obstruction of investigations in allegations of wrongdoing.</P>
  <P>Britain, it would appear, now has the lot. And the Tories, far from being shamed, are engaged in a damage limitation exercise.</P>
  <P>It is worth noting that sleaze allegations have come to light not because of parliamentary activity or any mechanism within the system, but through journalistic investigation. This ought to give pause to those who want to restrict the media in the name of privacy.</P>
  <P>John Major aspires to an image as an honest man of the people. Personally honest he no doubt is, but he leads the most corrupt government since the 1832 Reform Act.</P>
  <P>While it is still true that very few British civil servants or local government officials can be directly bribed, the corruption of the Major years takes a more insidious form.</P>
  <P>Powers have been removed from democratically-elected bodies and transferred to quangos stuffed with Tory supporters. The claim that secret donations to Tory funds are merely coincidental to this is now believed by no-one. Similarly disbelieved are Tory claims that Government favour, and the use or not of regulatory powers, is unrelated to party patronage.</P>
  <P>There have been perfectly respectable arguments advanced in the past against a Bill of Rights and a written constitution, based on the contention that these allow people to do only what is permitted, rather than forbidding them to do only what is prohibited. But the unwritten constitution also allows a Government with a majority to do anything it pleases; reverses in the courts are overturned, censure in investigations ignored.</P>
  <P>The unwritten constitution worked only as long as all political parties, the executive and the judiciary accepted their place within the system and played by its rules. It proved a broken reed as soon as a governing party was prepared to centralise powers for itself, put its supporters in charge of most public institutions and sell the remainder to fat cats, and put the favours and privileges flowing from those powers up for sale.</P>
  <P>Similarly long-term unchallenged rule by any  party would probably come to the same thing. The voting system, non-existent constitutional restraints and non-functioning checks and balances that made the current scandals possible all need fundamental change.</P>
  <P>The Tories' response will be to try to tar all politicians with the brush of corruption. The only way to avoid public disgust with the Tories from engulfing every serious party is for other parties to make it clear that they will tackle the problem at its root.</P>
  <P>One side effect of the affair has been to make the Tory Euro-sceptics look ridiculous.</P>
  <P>Unlike Liberal Democrat or Liberal critics of the Maastricht process, the Tory argument has been that the British parliament is perfect, and must be defended from foreigners. How many people are likely to be moved to defend a system and institutions so obviously decayed and inadequate?</P>
  <P>Some government supporters appear as willing to be bought as their Italian counterparts, and the Tories' stubborn attachment to the fiction of self-regulation makes the  investigatory processes here actually less effective than are Italy's magistrates.</P>
  <P>The whole affair poses grave risks for the democratic process, because public revulsion is liable to spread from those deserving of it to the whole of politics. But it does offer an   unusual chance to find an audience for constitutional reform.</P>

  <P>Once again Lib-Labbery was the issue which dared not speak its name at the Liberal Democrat conference. The formal agenda was devoted to many doubtless important matters, but not the question of whether the party ends up making a deal with Labour.</P>
  <P>Not that it was ignored. The issue was discussed at fringe meetings, in bars and on the seafront. Everywhere, in fact, where ordinary party members' views would attract little attention.</P>
  <P>The party leadership has at least dropped the fiction that speculation about these links is a perfidious invention of the media to distract attention from party policy.</P>
  <P>That stance became untenable because the issue is well-known to be causing ill-feeling in the parliamentary party, rows in federal committees, and a general atmosphere of mistrust.</P>
  <P>The issues in dispute over post-election deals with Labour are well-known and have been well-aired.</P>
  <P>What is causing problems now is the deepening suspicion that this deal already exists in outline and that, if the parliamentary arithmetic works, it will be sprung on the party immediately after the next election.</P>
  <P>Those privy to LibDem/Lab discussions are thought to amount only to Paddy Ashdown himself (and therefore also almost certainly his ever-present aide Alan Leaman), Lord Holme, and, maybe, Menzies Campbell, the latter one of very few MPs to view taking posts in a Labour-led government with enthusiasm.</P>
  <P>With no clear statement from Ashdown himself on what is going on, suspicion has grown. There is discreet head-counting in progress on both sides among the MPs likely to be returned and PPCs most likely to join them. That head counting will probably turn to arm-twisting and carrot-dangling.</P>
  <P>One leading party officer said that Ashdown's attitude was one of: "I am engaged in sensitive and delicate high politics, stop interfering and it will all turn out alright."</P>
  <P>There have been few denials of media speculation about the increasing closeness between the parties. And Lord Jenkins has been remained as leader in the Lords, despite allowing himself to be repeatedly described in public as one of Tony Blair's advisers.</P>
  <P>But what of Alex Carlile and his curious musings about a long-term merger of the LibDems and Labour into one anti-Tory party?</P>
  <P>These were aired on television just as the conference began, and a few days after Carlile had written a highly sceptical article about 'new' Labour in the Guardian. Whichever way round his recording of the interview and writing of the article happened, Carlile must have thought that they would be widely seen as contradictory.</P>
  <P>He must also have known that his musings about Labour links in general and merger in particular would make him highly unpopular with a large part of the conference, while handing the media on a plate a story about internal controversy.</P>
  <P>Was he just thinking out loud rather unwisely? It is possible, but unlikely given that Carlile is an experienced politician not given to hasty statements. There was speculation at conference that Ashdown encouraged him to air these views to test reaction. This can never be proved. But if Ashdown wanted to fly such a kite, he could hardly do so himself.</P>
  <P>Carlile's remarks annoyed a number of activists who have seats to fight where being seen as close to Labour is a serious vote-loser.</P>
  <P>This latter factor has thrown up some surprising Labour-sceptics.</P>
  <P>One might expect ex-SDP members to be enthusiasts for links with Labour. But Robert Maclennan is well-known not to be. And Charles Kennedy's new line 'the allies of change, not the allies of Labour' went down well at Brighton.</P>
  <P>The case of Shirley Williams was more startling. Her end-of-conference speech was overall pro-Labour, stressing that that party was vital to any future anti-Tory government.</P>
  <P>But when she got to the bit about not sacrificing LibDem ideals for a few ministerial posts, she was suddenly cheered long and loud.</P>
  <P>Williams looked astonished. Ashdown looked horrified at the conference's clear expression of hostility to Labour. If not allowed a debate, they would, it seemed, vote  with their applause. But members of the Ashdown circle were suddenly not applauding and looked glum. If this was kite flying too, the response was clear.</P>
  <P>The atmosphere of the conference had been made yet more febrile by Ashdown's New Statesman interview in the preceding week. In this he appeared to imply that PR was no longer a precondition for working with other parties, and that he wished to work with Labour even if it has an outright majority.</P>
  <P>So what would happen if an attempt is made to hussle the LibDems into bed with Labour a few days after the next election?</P>
  <P>Blair could not delay announcing his cabinet more than three days or so. Thus an immediate decision would be needed on any LibDem membership of it. The 'Fred' (fast response, early decision) party consultation mechanism should be in place.</P>
  <P>But the only body which will really count will be the new parliamentary party.</P>
  <P>This is where the head-counting, arm-twisting and carrot-dangling will get serious.  Will new MPs who have just fought against Labour be willing to support them, let alone coalesce? Will the returned MPs be in any mood to do likewise? Will those likely to prove awkward be brought off with junior ministerial posts?</P>
  <P>Only the MPs can stop any deal which appears inadequate, inequitable, and/or liable to jeopardise the Liberal Democrats' ability to function as a successful independent party.</P>
  <P>That raises another intriguing scenario. If the MPs, presented with a deal, said "no", could Ashdown remain as leader?</P>
  <P>The party conference will count for nothing. There is bound to be a special conference because it would not be difficult to get the signatures to call it, though Ashdown would probably call it himself to control the agenda and gain an endorsement.</P>
  <P>But it could not in practice meet for some weeks, and could it vote down any deal? Just imagine the speech that, purely by way of example, Campbell might make:</P>
  <P>"I am the first Liberal minister since Lloyd George's time. Through me, you, conference, are wielding real power. I am implementing vital parts of the manifesto we have all just fought on. Are you really telling me that I and my colleagues must return to the impotence of the opposition benches from which we have only just escaped?"</P>
  <P>The leadership line would probably carry by a huge margin. It is likely to encounter less difficulty, either immediately post-election or later, if Labour lacks an overall majority. It is working with a majority Labour government which would sooner or later threaten the LibDems' cohesion.</P>
  <P>The root of the problem is that enough has been said about LibDem/Lab links for everyone to suspect they are happening, but not enough to explain the reasoning, win hearts and minds, or allay fears.</P>
  <P>This mirrors of what has happened to Labour.</P>
  <P>The old Labour Party has been bullied into Blairism because of its desperation to win. But Blairism is indisputably a top-down project in the Labour Party. Working with Labour in government is similarly a top-down project in the LibDems.</P>
  <P>The whole thing driven by elites talking to each other, confident that dislike of the Tories will be enough to allow them their way.</P>
  <P>This approach is dangerous if a deal is done and the resulting government hits trouble.</P>
  <P>Guardian writer Martin Kettle, an open Blair supporter, said in his column it was: "worrying from a Blairite point of view that he [Blair] is so disdained in LibDem circles." He had earlier noted that it had proved almost impossible to find anyone at Brighton with a good word for the Labour leader, even among those favorably disposed to Labour generally. Blair was seen, "as an unacceptably rightwing trimmer." Well, quite.</P>
  <P>And it seems things are no better in Labour. Kettle said he "very rarely" meets people who are inspired by Blairism, and noted that the spontaneous reaction to mention of Blair's name was more often disappointment than enthusiasm.</P>
  <P>Blair may be popular now, but then anyone prepared to push the populist buttons while avoiding specific commitments could hardly fail to be popular against a corrupt and crumbling Tory government.</P>
  <P>When even a commentator as sympathetic as Kettle can note: "Blairism appears like an  army with plenty of officers and rather few soldiers", it is time for the Liberal Democrats   to think hard about how close they want their officers to drag them to this phantom army.</P>

   <H2>Kemp: The Road To Crecy</H2>
   <H3>by Daniel Hall<BR>Orion 1996.</H3>
  </CENTER>
  <P>No, not the adventures of Richard Kemp, Liberal Democrat standard bearer in the key target seat of Liverpool Wavertree (although we are told that 'Kemp' is from a Middle English word meaning champion, which must bode well for Richard): this is the story of Martin Kemp, our hero the creation of bright young author Daniel Hall.</P>
  <P>Historical fiction with the swashbuckling style of Ivanhoe<D> or Lorna Dorne<D>, or Kidnapped<D>, The Road to Crecy<D> combines the violently realistic battle scenes of Braveheart, with strict historical accuracy that movies have glaringly lacked. Kemp is a novel of the Hundred Years' War, and tells the story of Edward III's march across northern France, with brutal relish. From the dramatic stag hunt of the opening scene, this novel grabs one's attention and holds it throughout. The hero Martin Kemp, a cocky and fairly unsympathetic villien in a village near Leicester, is developed swiftly into more heroic (if initially naive) mould, following tales of King Arthur in his bid to be recognised as equal to any man, and to win the hand of beautiful daughter, Beatrice, of nasty knight Sir John Beaumont. Framed by Beaumont for rape and murder, abandoned in an antiquated and unfair legal system, Kemp is reprieved to join the campaign in France against Philip of Valois. With his longbow our hero departs for his shock awakening that war is far from the childhood tales of chivalry.</P>
  <P>"I wanted to explode the myths of medieval romance and chivalry" Hall has explained. "This is the Hundred Years' War as it really was - dirty, brutal and savage - seen through the eyes of a common archer." A key to the success of this book is its historical accuracy,  Hall putting his background as a history graduate to good use, and even taking archery lessons to get his detail right. We will all recognise influences, borrowed scenes, and stereotypes: the band of companions that Kemp joins become firm friends; the cheery prisoner joking with Martin on their way to the gallows and the unexpected reprieve; the affable Welsh archers who save Martin's life; and firm but fair Sir Thomas Holland and his Sergeant, Preston. And at times Kemp - refreshingly - verges on being the anti-hero that we all love - even burning enemies alive, and wielding a dagger to excess. At 16.99 this is excellent value for a well produced hardback novel, and a must for the Autumn.</P>
  <P>This is an excellent first book for author Daniel Hall, and I look forward to the next in the series. (I am sure we will hear more of Martin Kemp). Hall is well known politically (oft spotted in the bar at Brighton), having been Deputy President of Leicester University Students' Union (with fellow sabbatical one top Lib Dem campaigner Neil Fawcett), and is now political assistant to the Liberal Democrats running new authority South Gloucestershire, under former ALC Secretary, Chris Willmore. Candidates' Mailings suggest that candidates should find time to relax during the campaign. That is good advice for any activist - this is the book to buy to do it.</P>

   <H2>Anti-Gun Campaign Holds Mps At Gunpoint</H2>
  </CENTER>
  <P><B><I>Public demand for a ban on hand guns has been headline news since the appalling events in Dunblane last March. Gina Buckley welcomes the prospect of a total ban, but wonders whether this is really the way to  change the law?</I></B></P>
  <HR WIDTH=50%>
  <P>Speaking in 'On the Record' on October 20th  Paddy Ashdown made the point that our parliamentarians needed to avoid being bounced into a decision on the handgun ban for the wrong reasons. He and other MPs have been criticised over the summer for declaring their intention to keep an open mind about the ban until Lord Cullen's report was published.</P>
  <P>But, is a ban, introduced under these circumstances demonstrating representative government at work?  The point that seems largely to have been lost in all the media coverage of this issue is that our MPs are elected to make decisions which they believe are in the best interests of their constituents and the country, not merely to reflect public opinion on contentious issues. Although personally anti-gun, it is my view that any decision for an outright ban, would be better if  taken for the right reasons, and not just seem to be an attempt to maintain our share of  the popular vote/curry favour with the tabloids.</P>
  <P>Liberalism recognises that an individual's liberty may have to be curtailed for the benefit of society in general. But I admit to having difficulty reconciling my wish to see handguns banned with the rights of gun club members to pursue what has until now been a legitimate sporting interest, especially when the legislation to bring this about is rushed through.</P>
  <P>Having said that, there seems to be no way that it makes sense for the LibDems to prop up the Tories on this issue - in fact given the overwhelming expression of public opinion over the last few months, and that the Government have already moved beyond Lord Cullen's recommendations - it's hard to see how it could be anything other than a disaster for our Parliamentary Party to back the Tories' position and hold out against the total ban demanded by Labour.</P>
  <P>Bizarre as it feels to find oneself agreeing with David Mellor, I believe he was right to say that the tragedy in Dunblane was a 'defining moment' for the citizens of Britain. 'Ordinary' people have not had a tradition of carrying guns and we have been justifiably proud that our Police Force do not all carry handguns as a matter of course. A total ban is, therefore, a logical step on from this position.</P>
  <P>But, assuming that the vote goes in favour of a total ban, it raises the disturbing point about whether Parliament acceding to this kind of public reaction is akin to giving in to the bring back hanging lobby. What next? Will the tabloids whip up a mass campaign for the castration of sex offenders or chopping off the hands of thieves?</P>
  <P>The Snowdrop campaign showed how effective the mass of public opinion can be in bringing about radical change. So should we be using this as a springboard to demand sweeping changes in other areas that affect our lives?  Our use of motor vehicles perhaps? After all, although they are not purpose built instruments of destruction, speeding vehicles and their exhaust gases harm far more children each day than were murdered in Dunblane?</P>
  <P>Don't get me wrong. I have no wish to be cynical or callous about the loss felt by the bereaved parents and the whole community of Dunblane. Rather I am asking, is this a sign that the public at large are prepared to declare, on a number of issues, that 'enough is enough' and that the benefit to the many is worth the sacrifice of the few? Is this the strongest indication yet that the way forward is to be determined outside the old party political structures and by 'single issue' campaigners?</P>
  <P>If that is the case then we must ensure that liberal principles are at the root of such campaigns. We should also make sure that our elected representatives are allowed to  legislate on our behalf and not be pushed into a haphazard new system of 'government by public opinion, as interpreted by the mass media'.</P>

   <H2>A Dog's Tale</H2>
  </CENTER>
  <P><B><I>Bill Le Breton is seeking Liberal Democrats who share his concern about deals with Labour to sign a declaration of the party's independence. He was looking for the right words, when a dog came to the rescue.</I></B></P>
  <HR WIDTH=50%>
  <I>
   <P>I left Brighton feeling that representatives had been disenfranchised.</P>
   <P>For some time now I have considered that we as a Party needed to sign up to a declaration. The form here is but perhaps a hesitant start in what should be a debate amongst the assembled Party.</P>
   <P>I want also to thrust a lightning pole into the ground which might attract and maximise the energy that exists; to rally a faction into action - a large faction. I do worry that three or four late middle aged male suits are looking to the Party at the next election, to propel them into office. I believe that this is anathema to the rest of us, totally the wrong tactic for the Party and an elitist rather than a democratic goal.</P>
   <P>A show of the utmost strength is required to prevent them getting their way.</P>
   <P>My mind was, however, finally made up when, on returning from Brighton I found my ancient and beloved terrier missing. In his old basket, under the piles of blankets and old FOCUS leaflets that once kept him warm, I found the attached much stained manuscript:</P>
  </I>
  <P>He woke to the sound of the alarm, opened an eye and, glimpsing over the top of his basket, saw his master hit the switch on the radio/teasmade/personal computer/alarm clock. He cocked a single canine ear.</P>
  <P>"The Liberal Democrats have today backed a Labour campaign to ban electric tooth brushes," intoned the announcer. "A spokesperson for the Party said that this did not necessarily mean that it was doing so for the same reasons as Labour."</P>
  <P>A thin voice from 'down the line' patched in, "The Party takes a strong moral stance on this issue. It's all about helping individuals to help themselves. Electric tooth brushes, even with a circular action, can be a danger to the public good."</P>
  <P>Struth, he badly needed a drink. So, stretching a long stretch he stepped out of his basket. With a flick of his nose he pushed wide the bedroom door and padded down the stairs, a large tumour dangling uncomfortably between his elderly hind legs.</P>
  <P>When this abomination had been just a tiny lump his master had meant to take him to the vet. But a by-election to win or a Focus to deliver or an ALC conference to attend had one after the other delayed and delayed the visit. The tumour had continued to grow beneath his skin.</P>
  <P>In the kitchen his claws skated over the tiled floor to a water bowl marked "SALLY". As a white haired Welsh Terrier puppy, his owner, George Oliver Forth, had humorously dubbed him Algy. "Because of his likeness to a certain Liberal Prime Minister," George would guffaw to those gathered in his front room for branch meetings.</P>
  <P>When George married seven years ago, his wife insisted Algy's name be changed to Sally. It was very nearly a lot worse.</P>
  <P>Still uneasy about the change he dipped his nose distastefully into the vile bowl and slurped loudly.</P>
  <P>Time to check the Pee-mail he concluded and looked into the hall where a bundle of newspapers were piled beneath a table. "Liberal Democrats GO Forth," the banner headline yelled. "Local candidate chosen AGAIN." In outrageous mustard ink the strap line read, "Liberal Democrats for Safe and Sound Government in a Changing Global Village Makes Common Sense FIRST."</P>
  <P>"Safe and Sound" - that was the Party's new 'fits anything' slogan.</P>
  <P>He could hear his master at the top of the stairs explaining on the telephone the latest development to an editor. "No, this doesn't mean we're in coalition with Labour. We're fundamentally different. We're tougher on Tax for one thing and we want to reduce welfare spending."</P>
  <P>"Not knowingly left of Labour" - that was the Party's new 'safeguards everything' strategy.</P>
  <P>Groaning, he slid through a large hole in the rotting paint-peeled front door and sniffed the morning air. The garden was a disaster since 'she' had arrived. A lifetime's collection of printers, plate makers and folding machines had been thrown out of the house to rust in the borders. "We don't need these," she had declared after the honeymoon. "We can use the media to talk directly at the people. That's the modern way."</P>
  <P>He leapt the garden wall clipping his tumour painfully as he did so. When eventually George had taken him to the vet, they had been told that it was now too late, there was nothing that could be done. He was a victim of George's continual mindless activism, of George's readiness to compromise for short term benefit, of George's trust that it would all work out for the best.</P>
  <P>Across the pavement was his tree. He sniffed the Pee-mail. His tumour, still vibrating from the impact, made him blink. Cocking his leg he greeted his world. "Yo! It is a dog's life!"</P>
  <P>There had been a long gossipy message from the dark curly haired Scottie, the remnants of something wise from the red setter who lived across the valley, Dick from the city centre had left his fleeting mark and Cheggers had obviously slashed by - he was seldom seen these days since the operation had left him a consultant.</P>
  <P>And there was something decidedly strong and long from the Irish setter with the impeccable street fighting pedigree. His had drenched most of the other messages off the bark. "You lot always need someone to blame. You didn't like 'When you need courage drink a pint of Liberal Democracy' now the lot of you are grumbling about the Safe and Sound theme. I'll have you know that polling of lampposts and railings in Islington shows it's going down rather well."</P>
  <P>Back in the house George was still on the dog and bone. "Off the record," he went on, "We've painted ourselves into a bit of a corner. There's only a Labour spending list between us. 99% of the policy is identical. How could we vote against their Queen's Speech?"</P>
  <P>"Well, who walked into the corner in the first place?" Sally wondered as he slipped into the front room where all was as usual. The curtains were drawn, the computer purred like a happy cat and the light from the VDU coloured everything a drab blue. He walked between stacks of old Guardians, piles of Radical Bulletins and tottering mounds of Servile State pamphlets.</P>
  <P>He mounted a chair and viewed the screen. A Liberal Theory of Relativity by G.O. Forth. "I believe ..." So it began and faltered in a single unfinished line, the cursor pulsing. No progress, Sally noted, in the master work.</P>
  <P>Forth now joined him, the fine old FOCUS delivering team together again. His master switched on the T.V. The lunchtime news carried a joint press conference announcing a major agreement between Labour and Liberal Democrats on the justice system. The fax whined into action with details of the agreement, direct from Cowley Street, entitled Crime and Punishment - Safe and Sound Behind Bars.</P>
  <P>"Sally," said George in a great sigh, "We are being destroyed by absorption. And there seems nothing we can do about it."</P>
  <P>At this, the great ancestral Welsh Terrier inside him barked and howled and howled and barked.</P>
  <P>Dashing into the kitchen he drank the bowl dry. He spun it across the slippery floor to rest in front of the fridge and himself jumped on the draining board to drink from the washing up basin. To do what he had made up his mind to do he would need every drop of fluid he could find.</P>
  <P>Leaping back onto the floor by the fridge he bent his head beneath him, took the tumour of caution and weakness between his serrated teeth and, closing his eyes, bit it off.</P>
  <P>In agony he dropped the rotten tissue into that bowl marked SALLY and rushed through the house to the door, to the garden, to the street, leaving a trail of blood and gore in his wake.</P>
  <P>At his tree he sprayed with all his being, "I Sally Forth declare for Liberalism not Contrivance" and ran on to the next. Again he pissed, "I Sally Forth declare for  Principles not Expediency." And down the tree lined avenue he went blasting out his message onto the world wide web with his fierce cocktail of urine, puce and blood, "I Sally Forth declare for Independence not Coalition, for Liberty not Authority, for Co-operation not Surrender."</P>
  <P>Against lampposts and fences, parking meters and telephone boxes, traffic lights and litter bins: "I Sally Forth declare for Conviction not Connivance." Against out of town supermarket doors, school gates, post offices, bookmakers, amusement arcades, charity shops, and government offices he slashed out against conformity, ignorance and dependency, against poverty, bureaucracy and authority.</P>
  <P>Against a statue of Churchill and one of Cromwell, against the wall in College Green and finally, exhausted, anaemic and dehydrated, and, in growing darkness, Sally summoned her final dribbled urination against the small black boot scraper outside No 4 Cowley Street. And there on the doorstep in a pool of his own rhetoric this frail weakened white wire haired terrier keeled over and died.</P>

  <P>Dear <IMG SRC="../name.gif" ALT="Liberator">,</P>
  <P>I feel I must respond to the ecological doom-mongering being peddled by Tim Beaumont (<A HREF="../239/index.htm"><IMG BORDER=0 SRC="../name.gif" ALT="Liberator"> 239</A>).</P>
  <P>To begin with, the "Limits to Growth" to which he refers were discussed by John Stuart Mill, so they are hardly a new idea. They are also wrong. Mill was correct in his day, but our world is nothing like that understood by the classical economists. We are fast approaching a world where the most important commodity is know-how. And who would put limits on the growth of our knowledge?</P>
  <P>I make my living designing and writing computer programs. Once I have made a suite of programs, I can reproduce them at almost no cost - they can be reduced to nothing more than a tiny set of magnetised particles.</P>
  <P>Our knowledge is advancing at a tremendous rate. For example, we currently make "silicon chips" by etching with acid. This is akin to building the Forth Bridge out of a single carved lump of metal. And so scientists are now investigating building devices from the ground up. Out of individual atoms. This is a field known as "nano-technology" which holds enormous potential.</P>
  <P>In fact, if you plot the trends of our increase in knowledge on a graph, the figures start to go infinite within the next 50 years. We are about to fall into a "technological black hole", where in theory, anything is possible. Providing of course, that eco-fascists are not allowed to stifle human development.</P>
  <P>And here we come to the talk of restriction of civil liberties. I am a Libertarian Liberal. I didn't realise there was any other kind. Liberty, Libertarian and Liberal all come from the same root. All the great advances in human knowledge were instigated by great individuals building on the successes of other great individuals, often at the expense of persecution by their "community". Remember Galileo, put on trial for heresy at a time when heretics were burnt at the stake. His crime? Saying that the Earth was not the centre of the Universe, but rather revolved around the Sun.</P>
  <P>In short, Tim Beaumont's rant against capitalism, free trade (any trade in fact), and calls for restrictions on civil liberties would not have looked amiss in Pol Pot's Cambodia with its "Year Zero Agrarian Peasant's Utopia". I don't know which party Tim Beaumont thinks he is in, but it doesn't bear any resemblance to the party which I thought I had joined all those years ago.</P>
  <P><I>David Wildgoose, Rotherham</I></P>

   <H2>Some Warnings Sound</H2>
  </CENTER>
  <P>Liz Lynne and Bill Rogers normally have nothing in common; the one the MP most publicly opposed to working with Labour, the other the most uncritical supporter of Labour links. But in different ways and for different reasons, they both fanned doubts about Labour during the dramas of late November, which saw the latent resentment and mistrust in the Lib Dems about dealings with Labour finally boil over.</P>
  <P>Ashdown was provoked by Lynne's anti-Labour letter, and some more restrained comments by Chris Davies, into an explanation of his stance in Liberal Democrat News. He would have saved himself a lot of trouble had he deigned to publish this months ago.</P>
  <P>The letter from Lynne and her supporters, as quoted in the press, stated: "We are totally opposed to any pact or coalition with Labour before of after the next general election and feel this is in actual fact what you are working towards. We don't believe that you will be able to carry the party with you."</P>
  <P>Perhaps not. If those who want to work with Labour had the sense to stop mouthing off in public about how wonderful they think Tony Blair is, and stopped the stream of joint initiatives (which apart from the constitutional talks are mostly fatuous), they would probably get most of what they want anyway.</P>
  <P>A loose arrangement with a minority Labour government is almost certainly saleable to Lib Dems accustomed to these deals in local government. What is causing the trouble is the wide suspicion that talks between the two parties have already gone further than has been admitted, and that an inadequate 'take or leave' deal will be sprung on the Lib Dems.</P>
  <P>And what of Lord Rogers? Jack Straw's populism has finally sickened even him. The Police Bill gives the police powers to enter and bug private homes more or less at will, but Straw, whose politics seem to be guided by nothing but Sun editorials, has supported this. Even Rogers was moved to condemn him in The Observer.</P>
  <P>Until now the whole issue of working with Labour has been stuck in the thinking of the Alliance years; that the Lib Dems would help Blair neutralise his left wing. It becomes steadily clearer that a Blair government would not be a 'great reforming administration' as a few deluded Lib Dems have claimed.</P>
  <P>It would be a mirror image of the Tory governments of 1951 to 1974. They took Attlee's mixed economy welfare state as they found it, and did little to change anything important. They managed the system slightly differently. That is all Blair aspires to do to the Thatcherism he may inherit.</P>
  <P>The Lib Dems would do better to combine with the Labour left against 'new' Labour's enemies of liberty.</P>
  <P>For Straw's authoritarian populism is only partly a personal abberation. It is also part of what 'new' Labour is all about: a belief in coercive solutions to any behaviour of  which it disapproves, whether criminal (toughness on young offenders) or not (refusal by the young unemployed to follow the future Labour has chosen for them).</P>
  <P>Ashdown wrote in Liberal Democrat News that his party had voted at Glasgow to "work with others on our priorities and policies if they agree with us and if it is in the interests of those we represent".</P>
  <P>Lib Dem members should consider whether a Labour Party content with a home affairs spokesman who even Bill Rogers thinks is illiberal, counts as "others" who "agree with us".</P>
  <P>They should also ponder whether a Labour Party which reneged on the Scottish devolution deal is likely to do the same over constitutional reform.</P>
  <HR>
  <H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Who Chooses?</H2>
  <P><IMG SRC="../name.gif" ALT="Liberator">'s recent articles and letters about Liberal Democrat candidate approval (see page 18 onwards for more), suggest some exceedingly raw nerves have been touched among both interviewers and applicants.</P>
  <P>Any candidate approval system will throw up real or imagined grievances. And no-one wants to revert to the days when unwary drinkers in the National Liberal Club were liable to be hastily empanelled as interviewers.</P>
  <P>The Lib Dems clearly must have some process to filter out the inevitable applicants who are raving mad, have embarrassing criminal convictions, hold plainly illiberal views, or who are simply not up to the task whatever their other merits. Those who dislike the existing set-up must explain what they want instead.</P>
  <P>But there are three genuine concerns being voiced. First, does the current system test political skills and experience, or does it rely on the application by well-meaning amateurs of half-baked psychology, tests of body language and artificial situations.</P>
  <P>Second, does it favour those who often deal with formal interviews and role-play in their professional lives, and so know what is expected of them?</P>
  <P>Third, approval is supposed to be indefinite. What happens if a candidate is a complete disaster in real life?</P>
  <P>Perhaps some of this will be taken on board after the election.</P>

  <P>As <IMG SRC="../name.gif" ALT="Liberator"> went to press an intriguing behind-closed-doors meeting was in prospect for Liberal Democrat MPs, at which they would be given polling information from the party's most important target seats.</P>
  <P>The object of this presentation, held despite the misgivings of leader Paddy Ashdown, was to provide some factual basis for the argument about what effect the Lib Dems' public closeness to Labour is having on the campaign in target seats.</P>
  <P>Since both Lord Holme and Chris Rennard were to be involved, the MPs could at least expect to hear both sides of the argument about interpretation.</P>
  <P>For it is this factor which is giving many MPs and party officers the vapours about the cosying-up to Labour.</P>
  <P>Few object to any and every sort of post-election deal with Labour. But quite a lot believe that the more the Lib Dems talk about links with Labour now, the fewer seats they will win, and the less likely they will thus be to find themselves in any position to treat with Labour, let alone deliver a full constitutional reform package.</P>
  <P>They cite the Lib Dems' recent appalling run of local by-election results as evidence of the party being punished for being seen as too close to Labour.</P>
  <P>In this context, Liz Lynne stands at one extreme, being opposed to dealing with Labour at all. Her letter to Ashdown, which touched off November's furore, is understood not to have support from other MPs, though it attracted support from prominent party members in the north, which Ashdown would be foolish indeed to dismiss.</P>
  <P>Chris Davies' warning about 'Lib Dem bums in Labour Daimlers' gave voice to concerns that some Lib Dems are worrying more about the trappings of power than about how to get it or what to do with it.</P>
  <P>Meanwhile, an indeterminate number of petitions are circulating demanding special conferences with the object of forbidding further negotiations or joint working with Labour, or of voting down any post-election deal.</P>
  <P>A special conference before the election would be an act of suicidal madness on the part of those opposed to links with Labour. That close to an election, the party leadership would trounce them (complete with the sort of orchestrated vilification which was directed at anti-merger campaigners nine years ago) leaving their cause in a worse position than it is now.</P>
  <P>A post-election conference would be voting on something which had already happened, since it would hardly be physically possible to hold one before a new Government was announced, or before the two parties had announced the shape of their cooperation. Again, the leadership would deploy the argument that they would look ridiculous were they to leave something they had just joined.</P>
  <P>Whatever should happen, in practice it is likely to be the parliamentary party which decides, possibly legitimised  after the event. Calling the meeting on target seat data is a welcome sign that many of the MPs realise this keenly.</P>

   <H2>New Britain: My Vision of a Young Country</H2>
   <H3>by Tony Blair<BR>Fourth Estate, 8.99.</H3>
  </CENTER>
  <P>At the beginning of the 1990s it was fashionable for media pundits to say that in the new decade the British were becoming more compassionate and caring than  in the avaricious '80s. No more was heard of such comments after the Tory win in the 1992 general election. But perhaps the lesson of the 1992 election which at the time most people seemed to think Labour would win, was that people want to be more compassionate so long as it costs them nothing in time or money.</P>
  <P>If so then Tony Blair's new Labour is the perfect answer. Now you can look after number one, make millions, hate the poor and still avoid the taint of being an evil capitalist bastard by voting Labour once every five years. It costs nothing in higher taxes and yet shows concern and compassion for others.</P>
  <P>That is certainly the impression this reviewer is left with after reading New Britain, a collection of speeches by Tony Blair. It is full of woolly, generalised statements of concern for the poor, of support for social justice and of desire to help the underprivileged. What it lacks is any clear indication of what new Labour would actually do in government. The emphasis varies from social concern to economic hard-headedness depending on whether Mr. Blair is addressing the Labour Party conference or the Singapore Business Community, but the latter is always expressed in clearer, more specific terms than the former.</P>
  <P>Many Liberator readers will no doubt regret the lack of clear reforming policies from the leader of the Labour Party. I would advise them instead to be grateful. For the one original and clear idea expressed in this book is the "vision of a young country". By this Blair appears to mean not that Britain should be run by seven year olds but that it should be a country whose citizens believe that it will  be great again. Or as Blair puts it: "I want us to be a young country again. With a common purpose. With ideals we cherish and live up to...Ambitious. Idealistic. United." It sounds very similar to imperial rhetoric of a century ago.</P>
  <P>People who have such grand ideas about national destiny and who want to lead the nation toward that destiny are usually highly dangerous and should not be left in charge of anything larger than a corner shop. If there is a Labour government perhaps it will be for the best if it does as little as possible and if the need for fiscal rectitude prevents Tony Blair from implementing his vision of a young country.</P>

   <H2>The Crime Bill</H2>
  </CENTER>
  <P><B><I>The Tories' bill will waste money and cause more crime as Michael Howard plays to the 'get tough' lobby. Liberal Democrat peer Conrad Russell argues that a bill which is too savage and reactionary for traditional Tories (but not for Jack Straw) will worsen every aspect of crime and justice.</I></B></P>
  <HR WIDTH=50%>
  <P><B>There is only one person in the country I am not certain I would prefer to Michael Howard as Home Secretary, and that person is Jack Straw.</B></P>
  <P>When the Crime (Sentences) Bill had it second reading in the Commons, Jack Straw refused to vote against it. Alex Carlile was left to call a division on his own. It is one of the occasions when Liberal Democrats have had the courage to stand up against both the big parties together, and were praised for doing it in the Commons debate by so improbable a duet as Douglas Hurd and Kenneth Baker.
  <P>The bill is too savage and reactionary for them, but not for Jack Straw.
  <P>This is one of the occasions on which New Labour have cast grave doubt on whether they are an alternative to Toryism. Michael Howard's numerous Conservative critics must rely on us to start any genuine debate on this bill.
  <P>Michael Howard's bill is in essence about longer prison sentences. Anyone who wishes to oppose this should begin by showing what they will do instead.
  <P>There is nothing in Liberalism which suggests that we should not do everything we can to reduce crime.
  <P>Crime, if it deserves the name, infringes Mill's principle that we should allow those things which do no harm to others. Mugging in the street, breaking and entering, assault, vandalism and even leaving litter all do harm to others (as a former pupil who did a vacation job as a street sweeper told me very firmly). We should not be ashamed of trying to stop such things.
  <P>Measures to control crime must pass three tests. First, they must have a reasonable chance of catching the guilty and not the innocent. Second, they must be compatible with common humanity, which must include a chance of rehabilitation of the offender. Third, and perhaps most important, there must be a reasonable chance that they will be effective.
  <P>During an election we need two policies on crime, one to reduce crime, and another to satisfy the voters. The Tories, for 17 years, have been doing the second at the expense of the first, with the result that attempts to satisfy the voters are still ratcheting up the spiral of severity. We must now think of actually reducing crime.
  <P>We cannot do that by increasing sentences, for the simple reason that criminals are not deterred by sentences unless they expect to have to serve them. At present, according to Lord Chief Justice Taylor, a professional burglar has at most three chances in 20 of being caught. As gambling odds, those knock the National Lottery into a cocked hat. Most professional criminals are by temperament gamblers, and so long as their chances of winning are so much better than   they can ever be on the horses, the dogs or the pools, they will not be deterred by what happens to the odd incompetent who gets caught.
  <P>Thanks to the 'efficiency' of the Crown Prosecution Services (efficiency in the Treasury's sense, not mine) their chances of being convicted are far less than their chances of being caught. The chance of being convicted if you commit a crime tomorrow is in the region of three per cent.
  <P>Incredibly, the Government is proposing to cut the funding of the CPS, and Labour's rebuttal unit boasts that it has no plans to reverse that cut. The total cost of the CPS is 300,000. Michael Howard would do more to reduce crime by spending another 100,000 on the CPS, than by the several billions he intends to spend on prisons.
  <P>To deter crime, we should improve prevention, by locking and lighting and anti-theft devices in cars, by having men on station platforms and public transport to keep the innocent on the streets at night. We should then improve detection. This is not only a matter of more bobbies on the beat. We must reverse the run-down of police forensic science laboratories, and allow the police to afford to service their cars. We need to raise the number of women and ethnic minorities in the police to the critical mass which would protect them from harassment. There is no point in raising sentences until we can convince people that they are likely to serve them if they offend.
  <P>All of this is much too rational to interest Michael Howard. He prefers his proposals for what he calls 'honesty in sentencing', which means that people should serve all, or almost all, the sentence imposed on them by the court.
  <P>One can see the attraction of such a proposal to John Major, who intends that we should serve every last day of the five-year sentence we imposed on ourselves in 1992. Michael Howard still intends to allow a small reduction for good behaviour in prison, though whether enough to allow governors to retain control of their gaols we will have to wait to discover. What will not survive is the individual risk assessment involved in the present system of parole.
  <P>Good behaviour in prison is not necessarily an indicator of good behaviour on release. Paedophiles, for example, are almost free from temptation to offend in prison, and under the new scheme many of them will be released earlier than they are now.
  <P>More generally, if people are to serve almost all of their sentences, either there must be clear statutory direction that sentences pronounced by the courts must become shorter, or there will be a massive increase in the prison population. If we have the first, it will be the occasion for new anti-judge propaganda. If we have the second, the Penal Affairs Commission has estimated that it could increase the prison population by between 18,000 and 20,000. The cost of that remains to be counted.
  <P>In legal terms, the most objectionable of Michael Howard's proposals is the proposal for mandatory minimum sentences. It is the same system we now have in the mandatory life   sentence for murder. This is wrong because it abandons the fundamental principle that the punishment should fit the crime. As Lord Hailsham explained last time the House of Lords debated the mandatory life sentence for murder, one murder is not like another.
  <P>Some deserve the Government's description of 'literally the most heinous crime', but Lord Hailsham asked the House to compare the mercy killing of a terminal cancer patient with arson in a crowded tenement in which, by the grace of God, no-one was killed, and decide which was the more heinous crime. When he finally had to give way to the Commons, Lord Hailsham advised us to accept defeat with the memorable words, "let them have their silly way".
  <P>What is true of murder is even more true of rape. One rape is not like another. Some rapes, inflicted at knife point in the street and accompanied by unimaginable cruelties, are justly punished with a life sentence for the first offence. Yet it is equally rape if a woman embraces a man, murmurs endearments to him, takes off her clothes, entices him into bed, and at the very last moment changes her mind. The man who denies it to her commits a crime and should be punished. But does anyone think his crime is of the same severity as that committed by the sadist with the knife? Do they really deserve the same sentence? And if they are not to serve the same sentence, should not that decision by taken by the judge who has heard the evidence and seen the witnesses? Justice is individual: it cannot be done by formula.
  <P>Equally, one burglary is not like another. This route leads to the absurdity of the man in California who stole a pizza and was given a life sentence under the 'three strikes and you're out' rule. No-one should have to commit crime in order to eat, and we would do much more to reduce crime by ensuring that everyone has enough to eat than we will ever do by imposing such injustices in the name of justice.
  <P>It has been suggested that if there are many such injustices, juries will be less ready to convict, and witnesses less ready to come forward. This has happened before. We have had mandatory minimum sentences before. Until the penal reforms of the 1820s, which are part of the prehistory of the Liberal Party, there was a mandatory minimum sentence of death for theft of goods worth more than a shilling. However, the valuation of stolen goods, being a matter of fact, was a matter for the jury. Over and over again, people were accused of stealing goods worth 5 or 10, but convicted of stealing goods worth 11 1/2d, and therefore spared a hanging. Juries might lose patience with recidivists, and the finding that goods were worth 11 3/4d constituted a sort of 'last warning'.
  <P>Professional criminals or strangers to the county tended not to get the sort of mercy locals could usually count on for a first, and often second or third, offence. Severity in legislation was tempered by a populist sense of what was fair. If Michael Howard gets his way, he will find the Sun newspaper, as fickle as its heavenly namesake, crusading against his stupid inhumanity. Poetic justice takes odd   forms.
  <P>All this will not reduce crime. It is not even true that people do not commit crimes inside prison. Prison overcrowding, by reducing supervision, is increasing prison crime to a terrifying level. Crime is the only thing prisoners have in common. They tend to talk about it, and come out knowing far more of how to commit it than they did when they went in. Since cuts in housing benefit, among other things, are making it harder to rehabilitate ex-offenders, ex-prisoners will remain criminals.
  <P>What will all this cost? The White Paper, with blind optimism, estimates an additional 375 million to 435 million for the recurrent costs of extra prisoners. This is wrong, for a start, because it assumes a deterrent drop in the prison population of 20 per cent because of severer sentences. Until the chances of detection and conviction are larger, the true figure will almost certainly be nil. It might be optimistic to double the cost to correct for this. In addition, the figure leaves out the capital cost of building 12 new prisons (which might again have to be doubled if the 20 per cent deterrent effect is a mirage).
  <P>We are given no figure for the cost of this, since it will be done under the private finance initiative, and will be subject to commercial confidentiality. This does not mean there will be no cost.
  <P>If we allow for the effect of the probable massive breakdown in prison security because of understaffing and overcrowding, we could be looking at as much as 3p on the Income Tax. All this, for no reduction in crime, is a waste of public money of Poll Tax proportions.
  <P>We should campaign against it under the slogan 'Tory Tax Bombshell'. I don't see why the devil should have all the best tunes.

   <H2>Bosnia Ballots On The Brink</H2>
  </CENTER>
  <P><B><I>Michael Meadowcroft, co-ordinator of the International Observer mission for out-of-country refugee votes, reports on how war-torn Bosnia grappled with running its first election.</I></B></P>
  <HR WIDTH=50%>
  <P>Waiting in the makeshift military air terminal at Zagreb alongside soldiers of many hues for the IFOR flight to Sarajevo, I watched the giant Hercules army transport 'plane flop down on to the airstrip. As it taxied to a halt its provenance became clear from its markings:</P>
  <P>"Royal Norwegian Air Force". "Great," I overheard an American soldier remark, "the Norwegian flight attendants are much more attractive". There are, of course, no flight attendants as such at all on any flight in or out of Sarajevo but the system of bookings and scheduled flights works reasonably well, administered by the Americans in Zagreb and the French in Sarajevo. From the 'plane one can clearly see the rows of burnt out houses and, on landing, the pitiful state of the Sarajevo airport. The camaraderie of war zones is also warmly apparent. My transport hadn't appeared and a 4x4 stopped at the checkpoint. The Bosnian driver leaned out and smiled, "Your driver hasn't arrived and my passenger wasn't on the 'plane. So, why don't I give you a lift into town?" With hotels still not back in operation the OSCE has a number of "transit houses" in Sarajevo prepared for visiting staff. These are local people's residences in which they enthusiastically let off rooms. Some are notorious! I ask my colleague, "Where am I staying tonight?" "The Dog!" he replies. I immediately know the house, high up on a hill on the east of the city, overlooking the river, where the warm and welcoming couple have a huge hound. Fortunately for once it bears out that well known adage that the bigger the dog the softer it is!</P>
  <P>Later, relaxing with colleagues over a beer in the early evening sunshine on the terrace of a cafe in the old town quarter of Sarajevo, one could be forgiven for imagining that one was in northern France or even - almost - Covent Garden. That is, until one glances across the river to the cemetery on the hill beyond where the hordes of fresh graves are marked with what to western eyes are curiously shaped headstones or simple boards. To a Liberal the reopening of Sarajevo's old town, where perhaps three-quarters of the shops and restaurants are now back in business, is testimony to the remarkable resilience of the human spirit. Owners are daily driving trucks across delicate borders to bring back supplies, and the determination to demonstrate that the horrors of the past will not be allowed to destroy the future is palpable.</P>
  <P>Of course, based in Sarajevo one is partially cocooned from the grim realities of the postwar situation which exists in most Bosnian towns. The stark electoral registration figures give you the picture. 40% of the Bosnian electorate are refugees, half of them outside the country. In other words, only 60% of Bosnians reckoned that they would be able to vote at the place where their names were recorded on the  1991 Census - the qualifying date for taking part in the elections. The logistics of the electoral process were overwhelming and they survived only because those involved  on the spot improvised brilliantly and because the results gave the main parties the seats they anticipated so that they were all prepared to turn a blind eye to the technical infringements of the electoral law. They would, in any case, have been largely self-cancelling, all three sides having indulged in manipulation to a greater or lesser extent. It was inevitable that the nationalists would dominate these first post-war elections but there were liberals who bravely put their heads over the parapets and who made the difficult and unrewarded case against ethnicity and separation. These colleagues deserve our support.</P>
  <P>The Bosnia and Herzegovina elections were miles from being "free and fair" - the lack of freedom of movement and of free media were, for instance, vividly obvious - but they were the best that were possible in the circumstances. At best they have got the nationalistic leaders of the three entities meeting and talking, and at worst they stopped the war and bought a little time. The whole electoral process was in the hands of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe. The OSCE is the most tangible outcome of the Helsinki talks of the 1970s and is one of the very few bodies that includes Western, Central and Eastern Europe on an equal basis. As such it was generally acceptable to all sides as the executive organisation for the elections agreed under the Dayton Agreements. However, this acceptability should not mask the risks to the future of the OSCE that was inherent in taking on the responsibility.</P>
  <P>Certainly it was a brave act, helped by human rights organisations, such as the Helsinki Committees who, although they believed that enough safeguards were not yet in place to hold reasonable elections, nevertheless gave practical assistance with observing once the decision to go ahead was taken.</P>
  <P>OSCE largely formed the Provisional Election Commission and its Appeals Committee, managed the actual electoral administration, approved the "Supervisors", who formed a unique tier of personnel from outside Bosnia, authorised to intervene if they believed the process was been carried out illegitimately, and co-ordinated the International Observer Mission which monitored the whole process! The main OSCE office is based in Vienna and its Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) is in Warsaw and it was important for the independence of the Observer Mission that the offices were separate, geographically as well as organisationally.</P>
  <P>The out-of-country refugee registration and voting was organised by an ad hoc Refugee Election Steering Group based in Vienna, largely staffed by personnel from the splendid International Organisation for Migration. This involved the  logistical nightmare of organising the process separately in twenty-four countries. Three-quarters of the 640,000 voters thus registered were in Croatia, Germany and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (ie Serbia and Montenegro) and only Croatia and FRY had in-person voting - all the others voted by post. Given that all the votes had to be counted within  Bosnia, essentially in Sarajevo, the problems of transportation and security were immense.</P>
  <P>Those who are still sceptical about the value of international election observation should realise that the postponement of the Bosnian municipal elections came about through the thoroughness and professionalism of those observing the registration process in Serbia. Unusually, because of the sharp focus on ethnicity in key towns and cities, the local elections are by and large seen by voters in the three entities as being more important than the national and provincial elections. Given this, it would have been disastrous to have gone ahead in the light of the manipulation spotted by the international observers.</P>
  <P>The problem was very simple: under the Dayton Agreements eligible voters could register to vote in any of three places - where they now lived, where they were living at the time of the 1991 Census, and where they intended to live. It was this third provision, inserted for quite proper reasons in order to encourage Bosnian refugees to return and to establish a new home as soon as possible, which caused the problem. The Serbian authorities realised that this provision could be used to entrench a Serb ethnic majority in key towns such as Srebrenica and Brcko and they set about putting illegitimate pressure on refugees in Serbia to register in these two or similar towns. Observers realised what was happening, reported it promptly and their evidence was tested further and then used as the basis for postponement of the municipal elections to next Spring, by which time new rules for registration can be formulated.</P>
  <P>The Bosnian situation is still delicate and the country will need immense political, financial and personnel assistance if it is to retain sufficient stability and security to avoid its atomisation into still smaller micro states. Inevitably, perhaps, it has already slipped out of the headlines. If this is a sign that quiet progress is being made then it may be a good thing, but if it betokens a world weariness with the problems of the Balkans then it could be a sad sign that once more the selfish West wants to wash its hands of its responsibility for the fate of its fellow human beings. Liberals need to keep up the pressure to maintain international involvement until the democratic process is sufficiently entrenched and accepted for the people of Bosnia to be able to look to a peaceful future.</P>

  </CENTER>
  <P>Dear <IMG SRC="../name.gif" ALT="Liberator">,</P>
  <P>Rarely have I read such a depressing letter as that contributed by David Wildgoose in response to Tim Beaumont. His use of the label eco-fascist, and his comparison of Tim Beaumont with Pol Pot, is deeply offensive and unneccessary. To throw these labels around against people who simply take a different view to yourself is to demean the suffering inflicted upon millions of people who experienced at first hand what fascism was really about. I expect that degree of insensitivity from Theresa Gorman (who talks of eco-terrorists). From a Liberal Democrat, the use of the term in this context is nothing short of disgusting.</P>
  <P>Name-calling aside, the core of Wildgoose's argument seems to be that there is no ecological crisis, and no need for gloom, because the advance of information technology will solve all of our problems. This is fatuous. There are few within the Party that will match the Green Lib Dems (and the Green Lib Dems' journal Challenge) for enthusiasm for the new technology, but however good Wildgoose gets at his programming career, his computer software will never feed anybody, nor replace the countless other aspects of the traditional economy which are currently leading to ever greater consumption of energy and raw materials and the production of wastes. Although IT has potential to remove some unneccessary car journeys, there is no expectation it will halt the relentless increase in vehicle ownership and use. The increase in greenhouse gas emissions will continue apace without political action to curb them. And so on.</P>
  <P>It is certainly true that technological advances will have some effect of mitigating environmental impact. Nobody however seriously expects them to remove the fundamental nature of the challenge ahead of us. If Wildgoose wishes to maintain otherwise, evidence rather than insults would be useful. His statements as they stand are merely complacent and fly in the face of current scientific opinion.</P>
  <P>I remember that, some years ago, Cyril Smith made the comment that he had the liberty to damn well drive his car where he wanted, when he wanted, and however much he wanted. As indeed, does David Wildgoose. But if this is to become the definition of liberty in this debate it is a strange throwback to a less sophisticated past, and it is a definition that excludes the freedom to breathe clean air, to live in streets that are safe for children and that have any vestige of community, and that also excludes the right of access for the majority of citizens who do not own their own car. Similar arguments can be applied to the way so-called "free" trade currently works to the disadvantage of a significant proportion of the world's citizens. Liberty in my world is not worth the name if it doesn't apply to everyone.</P>
  <P>So does that justify action to severely curtail individual human rights? I doubt it - and since  neither Tim Beaumont nor the Green Liberal Democrats advocate this I'm not sure why we should waste time debating it. I suppose one might   describe such an exercise as a Wildgoose chase (I bet that's the first time anyone's ever made that joke ...)</P>
  <P><I>Mallen Baker Vice Chair Green Liberal Democrats</I></P>
  <HR>
  <H2 ALIGN=CENTER>Strained Green 2</H2>
  <P>Dear <IMG SRC="../name.gif" ALT="Liberator">,</P>
  <P>David Wildgoose's logic, and his understanding of the Green position, are at fault (letters, <A HREF="../239/index.htm"><IMG BORDER=0 SRC="../name.gif" ALT="Liberator"> 240</A>). The Green case against growth is not against any or all growth, nor is it doom-mongering. Greens certainly have no objection in principle to the growth of knowledge, we would however very much like to see a concomitant increase in wisdom.</P>
  <P>The Green case against growth is quite specifically a warning of what will happen, indeed what is already happening, if policies directed towards undifferentiated 'economic growth' are not seriously and quickly reappraised.</P>
  <P>JS Mill was not the first to accept the notion of 'limits to growth'; the basic principle is as much an ethical as a practical one, and all the great religions incorporate the idea that we should live within our means. The Green movement is following them; in some ways it can be likened to a religion itself.</P>
  <P>Far from being 'wrong', as Mr Wildgoose claims, the limits to growth are very real and present facts of life. They loom much more immediately than in JS Mill's day. Some 150 years ago there was still room in the world for population and industrial activity to expand; Mill recognised the threat posed by unthinking acceptance of the industrial imperative, a threat more apparent then on the ethical front than on the ecological.</P>
  <P>Mr Wildgoose may not know that the explosion in human numbers and the continued expansion of economic activity since then have now brought us to the point where no less than 40 per cent of the world's net primary production (which is, more or less, the total net conversion of solar energy) is now appropriated by our own species, and that proportion is still rising. If it were to go on increasing (as continued economic growth implies) we would be using over 100 per cent of NPP within a few decades, which is of course impossible.</P>
  <P>It is not the Greens who are doom-mongering, it is those who do not see any cause for concern in this headlong rush to disaster. Does Mr Wildgoose seriously believe that our species can go on increasing our share of NPP for ever? If not, when does he suggest we should stop? Are there any lengths to which he would not go? He is assuming (possibly without realising it) an infinite world.</P>
  <P>Mr Wildgoose is quite right to suggest that the economic activities of the future will change and  develop. This is because the natural framework within which all our  activities take place, the biosphere, is finite, and is already showing signs of stress under the pressure of economic growth. Thoughtful people know the limits to growth are very close indeed, in many respects we have already exceeded them.</P>
  <P>There are many people like Mr Wildgoose who find it hard to change their ideas. I suggested above that the Green movement has much in common with a religious movement. I was 'converted' in the early 1970s after reading Schumacher's Small is Beautiful and the Blueprint For Survival, which appeared in The Ecologist.</P>
  <P>I suddenly realised that many of the political and economic objectives of modern society, uninterrupted economic growth being the core belief, were impossible of achievement, dangerous, immoral and unnecessary. So I joined the Liberal Party, thinking I would find like-mined people in it. There were, but not as many as I expected, so I founded the Liberal Ecology Group (now the Green Lib Dems).</P>
  <P>It is sad that Mr Wildgoose regards those who warn against the dangers of our present-day Gadarene rush as 'eco-fascists'. He can rest assured that the last thing Greens wish to do is stifle human development. We are desperately anxious that mankind should mature enough to reject the current obsession with economic growth, and learn to live in peace with each other and the rest of natural creation.</P>

      <H2>The Flood System</H2>
      <H3>by Geoff Tansey  & Tony Worsley.<BR>Earthscan 1995 15.95</H3>
    </CENTER>
    <P>Money may make the world go around, but it is food (and water) that keeps us alive.  Of course, as agriculture has become increasingly commercialised, the two things have become inseparably mixed.  But "The Food System" goes way beyond being just another expose of the ain't-it'awful world of agribusiness and how huge companies make fortunes out of our need to eat, while screwing the Third World in the process.</P>
    <P>In fact, Tansey and Worsley have produced a kind of mini-encyclopedia on anything and everything to do with the food system, even though the sections are not set out alphabetically.  There are lively chapters on major themes, amply supplemented with little boxes on separate items, pie-charts, tables of often esoteric but utterly riveting information, including what ancient peoples included in their diets.</P>
    <P>Far from being academic in style (despite its serious intention), the book fizzes and entertains like a really well-written Focus leaflet, showing just how good a product one can produce with wit and imagination, hard facts and a good computer.</P>

      <H2>The Electoral System in Britain</H2>
      <H3>by Robert Blackburn<BR>MacMillan 1995</H3>
    </CENTER>
    <P>Blackburn opens by reminding us that "Few subjects in politics are as important as the way in which the people of a country choose those who will govern them". Most commentators from Herodotus onwards concur with this.</P>
    <P>At its most simple level Blackburn presents us with a comprehensive, factual and in the main, accurate textbook. His subject is brought as close to the present as the constraints of publishing allow. Thus at one point he cites Sanders and another vs. Chichester and another (11.11.1994) - of Literal Democrat notoriety, whereas on the subject of corrupt and illegal practices in elections he closes on Regina vs. Rowe, ex-parte Mainwaring and another (21.1.1991) which decision was overturned on appeal (and I believe has had one further citation in the development of caselaw on such matters since). Keep those donations coming in... Tower Hamlets Liberal Democrats Action Trust , 8 Chisenhale Road, London E3 5QZ.</P>
    <P>Ignore the dryness of this review, we are not dealing with a legalistic text here and the cases mentioned above only serve to underline the currency of the book. A fair body of the work is essentially received information, but this is spiced with a wealth of anecdote making it to my confessed surprise, readable. I will however confess that my lifelong indifference was maintained to the 67 pages on electoral reform and proportional representation.</P>
    <P>As an agent I find this book useful, as a politician to not be able to dip into it and be hooked is to have missed something. Students - essential. The index is weak, but the subject organisation of the work should overcome this.</P>

      <H2>The Ultimate Avengers</H2>
      <H3>by Dave Rogers<BR>Boxtree / Lumiere / Channel 4 Books 1995 16.99</H3>
    </CENTER>
    <P><I>Steed gives a reference<BR>Emma gets booked</I></P>
    <P>There are a huge number of telefantasy books available these days, of variable quality - ranging from the cheap and superbly researched Virgin Doctor Who and others range, to the dreadful (and less cheap) Pioneer Star Trek  collection.  Boxtree tend to be somewhere in between; their Blake's 7  book is hideous, Doctor Who only slightly better, but The Ultimate Avengers looks, and is, excellent.</P>
    <P>This is a good job, as it is the only Avengers reference book in print.  And the couple of out-of-print ones are by . . . Dave Rogers.  Funnily enough, he's reported to threaten competition into never getting off the ground, but there we go.  This is a thicker but smaller format (and more expensive) version of his previous main work, and is a complete guide from the junked first series onwards to what became the epitome of British high camp and style, and introduced the notion of heroines using their brains - and judo - instead of simpering.</P>
    <P>His summaries of each story are short and stylish, with only occasional mistakes (a figure of 480,000, rather than 180,000, appears in his account of Death of a Batman, while the synopsis for the Cathy Gale story Esprit de Corps, for example, is hopelessly confused and inaccurate -all the more peculiar, as his longer piece in The Complete Avengers had no difficulty). Irritatingly, he puts all the episodes in the order in which they were filmed, rather than actually broadcast - then giving broadcast dates after   each episode, but often getting them wrong!  The swish layout is also rather spoilt by an enormous number of typos, which surely any proof-reading should have spotted. Even a computer's spell-checker could manage some of them!</P>
    <P>The real worth of the book is the huge amount of background  information he's uncovered, both from documentation and exhaustive (and contradictory!) interviews with many  concerned.  The 'behind the scenes' sections are greatly expanded, with additional 'notes in the margin' appearing next to many stories.  Former scriptwriter, story editor, producer and general godfather Brian Clemens provides the greatest volume, although costume designers waspishly revealing who really  did the clothes, after all this time, are worth a read.</P>
    <P>Some of the anecdotes are rather good - I particularly liked the time Steed's clothes were stolen from a car and the stuntmen's dodgy underworld contacts had them returned.  This happened again, but: "Sorry, guys.  It must have been an amateur."</P>
    <P>Both Honor Blackman and Diana Rigg were the second  choices for their roles. There's even a picture of the first  Emma Peel, sacked for having no sense of humour!  For the Diana Rigg episodes to be shot in colour, they needed American money - and so had the most bizarre American restrictions  (guns must not be pointed at people's heads, cigarettes must not be ground under foot, the word 'idiot' may not be used . . . !).</P>
    <P>Poor Linda Thorson, in an attempt to make Tara King unlike Mrs. Peel, was made to have her hair hideously peroxided -and so made her first ten stories with a wig to simulate her natural colour while it grew back.</P>
    <P>Several pictures appear of pretty horrid 'looks' tried out on Joanna Lumley before Purdey was established properly to shoot her to stardom.  Steed and all his main Avengers sidekicks from Ian Hendry's Dr. Keel on had ranged from stunning to very good - until they finally hit one who was just average.  So, what was Mike Gambit for?  And what is Gareth Hunt doing these days, exactly?  Oh, yes. Three kinds of beans.</P>
    <P>Avengers spin-offs you might not have heard of - but Mr. Rogers has - include the stage play, the South African radio series and script extracts for two films that never got off the ground from about 1980 (and what purports to be a story outline for, but is actually just the opening scenes to, a 60s Steed / Mrs. Gale movie called off when Honor Blackman left to do Goldfinger). A brief guide to locations and cars used, as well as merchandising from singles to board games are covered to close, along with an advert for the videos - though, irritatingly, not informing us which ones are available, or on which tapes.</P>
    <P>All in all, it is fortunate that the only book on the market is good enough to highly recommend, but with two strong caveats: the number of silly mistakes makes it hard to escape the conclusion that it was rush-released to tie in with Channel 4's current rescreening of the Fourth Season   (distinguished by special cards at each ad break, which, oddly, aren't mentioned here . . . possibly because his publishers, Channel 4, aren't bothering to use them!); and when (please!), some day, this is not  the only book on the market, the price should be driven down about a tenner.</P>
    <P>Do you think Honor could be persuaded to start doing PPBs for us again? I only ask.</P>

      <H2>Interesting Times</H2>
      <H3>by Terry Pratchett<BR>Corgi 1995 4.99</H3>
    </CENTER>
    <P>Not exactly, I regret... see my last review of the Pratchett oeuvre (<IMG SRC="../name.gif" ALT="Liberator"> 230). Yet is this unfair, here we have the academia of the Unseen University, Rincewind, Cohen the Barbarian; Twoflower makes a return, but the development of these characters lacks something I feel.</P>
    <P>Let us call the Agatean Empire (of the Counterweight Continent) China, then the main thread of the story is what is commonly known about Chinese history. The juxtaposition of "Red Army" with terra-cotta soldiers is brilliant, and around it fragments of Pratchett's political philosophy fall into place. Basically scepticism of those who would seek to speak for "the people" (who invariably didn't request such generosity). Rincewind waxes lyrically on the subject...</P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>
      <P>'All those people out in the fields...if you have a revolution it'll be better for them....?' 'Of course', said Butterfly, 'They will no longer be subject to the cruel whims of the Forbidden City.'</P>
      <P>'Oh that's good', said Rincewind. 'So they'll sort of be in charge of themselves, will they?'</P>
      <P>'Indeed' said Lotus Blossom.</P>
      <P>'By means of the People's Committee.'"</P>
    </BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>Pratchett's solutions tend to be autocratic, if variously benign and common-sensical.</P>
    <P>So, as story it bounces along; not the best Discworld novel, but worth it for it's moments. It's a shame that the McSweeney's aren't developed at all... a very old family, I didn't know Pratchett knew them... but then I suppose everybody does... "A very old established family".</P>

      <H2>The Daydreamer</H2>
      <H3>by Ian McEwan with illustrations by Anthony Browne<BR>Red Fox 1994 3.50</H3>
    </CENTER>
    <P>I didn't catch the name of my reviewer... "I've got that book" she said, "Daddy's reading it to me".  She liked the burglar most, her sister liked the baby. I liked William Cat.</P>
    <P>I've never really got on with Ian McEwan as an author; that level of sub-surreality doesn't quite gel for me. Neither I nor the bookshop where I acquired it identified it as a children's book at first, however for reading yourself pitched at around the ten year old I'd say. Useful for answering those difficult questions... the cat dies, the new baby arrives... wanking.</P>

  <A NAME="01"></A><HR><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><IMG ALIGN=TEXTTOP SRC="../rb2.gif"> Dead Parrot Shot on Launchpad</H2>
  <P>Combining Paddy Ashdown with a word processor and some books and the result is usually trouble.</P>
  <P>His grandly-titled 'Liberal Democrat News Lecture' in January featured a lot of speculation about Lib-Labbery and, only in rather toned-down form, Ashdown's views on the lack of future of the welfare state.</P>
  <P>The section on Lib-Labbery was the most widely reported, but it would not have been had an earlier draft of the speech survived.</P>
  <P>This is understood to have called for an eventual 85 billion cut in public spending by effectively forcing everyone to take out private insurance for those services now provided through the welfare state.</P>
  <P>This was shown to the mild-mannered chief whip Archie Kirkwood, who reportedly hit the roof, and then to the less mild-mannered Liz Lynne, who hit it a good deal more loudly. Lynne, who is not the most influential MP with Ashdown because of differences over the issue of deals with Labour, then enlisted formidable reinforcement in the shape of Earl Russell. This trio managed to convince Ashdown that his original musings were suicidal. A certain amount of backtracking then followed.</P>
  <P>Disaffection with the Tories has at least proved the public's continuing attachment to both the National Health Service and state pensions.</P>
  <P>Russell is fast emerging as the only person of any consequence in the upper reaches of the Liberal Democrats able to relate day-to-day politics to Liberal first principles.</P>
  <P>Ashdown has done this before with a document circulated after the 1992 general election, whose adherence to laissez-faire economics was so over the top that it was not allowed to appear in its original form (<IMG SRC="../name.gif" ALT="Liberator"> 207). This eventually limped through the Harrogate conference that year, badly mauled in a vote, to become the New Agenda paper and be promptly forgotten with all the other tonnage of policy documents.</P>
  <P>The Lib-Labbery part of his speech gave a welcome refutation of the idea that anyone might engage in a pre-election pact. But the crucial post-election difference, as we have argued before, lies in whether to support a Labour government issue-by-issue, to maximise Liberal Democrat influence. The alternative involves writing Labour an effective blank cheque to support it for five years (let alone 10) in return for a few dubious privileges, effectively signing away that influence. That would be responsibility without power. And if power without responsibility if the prerogative of the harlot, the reverse is the prerogative of the failure.</P>

  <A NAME="02"></A><HR><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><IMG ALIGN=TEXTTOP SRC="../rb2.gif"> Briefs in a Twist</H2>
  <P>Some pretty odd party documents have come <IMG SRC="../name.gif" ALT="Liberator">'s way over the years. In this grand tradition, we have the creative brief distributed by the Liberal Democrat general election campaign team to, presumably, advertising agencies.</P>
  <P>We showed this only to Liberal Democrat members with professional expertise in the field. Their opinion could be summed up in the phrase 'round objects'. Their general view was that it was asking agencies to come up with a strategy, rather than asking them to apply their skills to implementing one set by the party.</P>
  <P>The document's origin and precise status are unclear, but it appears authentic. So in the interests of openness, here is a selection of what the activist in the street might be able to look forward to by way of national support in the next campaign.</P>
  <P>It starts from the premise that the 'Liberal Democrat Guarantee' will be a foundation for the campaign. Apparently this is because, "the purpose of the guarantee is to demonstrate the unique "added value" offered by a vote for the Liberal Democrats."</P>
  <P>Well, that is one way of putting it.</P>
  <P>The three well-known themes are investing in people, cleaning up the mess in politics and building for the long term. Snappy slogans? Oh dear no, these soundbites must be "put into layman's terms".</P>
  <P>It continues by stating that voter should see the Liberal Democrats as, "specific, clear, honest, far-sighted, fresh, mature, not insiders". Kind to orphans and fond of furry animals too, perhaps.</P>
  <P>We made up the last two, but you get the drift. And just in case that isn't clear, people must see the Liberal Democrats as "people orientated and real". Phew!</P>
  <P>It seems that Paddy Ashdown's programme for the coming year will afford the chance to "test various options on the road". We wonder if anyone has warned him.</P>
  <P>A variety of stage sets will be built, including something called a "speak to the people set-ette", which may be marketing speak for a soapbox.</P>
  <P>There will be no campaign song, but there has been an offer from the former Animal Alan Price to write the music required. This should be a considerable improvement on the music commissioned by party apparatchik Alan Watson, which unmemorably graced the Liberal Democrats' first conference. What about Price's film score hit 'O Lucky Man'? Or a version of the Animals' hit titled "We've Gotta Get Out of Third Place"?</P>

  <A NAME="03"></A><HR><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><IMG ALIGN=TEXTTOP SRC="../rb2.gif"> Leaks R Us</H2>
  <P>A profusion of leaks seems to have struck the Liberal Democrats of late in publications with an even higher circulation than that of <IMG SRC="../name.gif" ALT="Liberator">. First Tom McNally gained press coverage for an article he had written which heavily trailed Ashdown's speech. This signalled most of what would be said about working with Labour and urged support for it. This appeared initially to be an 'official leak', but McNally is reported to have looked sheepish at the federal executive, where displeasure was expressed about this.</P>
  <P>The next day came the leak of a party researcher's scenarios for countering attacks from other parties during a general elelction. This was later said to be an attempt to play devil's advocate, and indeed it is hard to see why such a thing should have been produiced unless this is true.</P>
  <P>But such a document would presumably only have been circulated to senior Liberal Democrat MPs and strategists, a category not previously thought to include the editor of the Daily Telegraph. Since that paper is where the document ended up, the original circulation list would doubtless make fascinating reading.</P>
  <P>Next came an item in Private Eye which claimed that Lord Holme and Menzies Campbell were engaged in secret plots to make the latter party leader. There was a 'draft Campbell' whispering campaign last year, and it may have restarted. Those who know Lord Holme's record will of course find it unbelievable that he would be engaged in any such plot, if indeed it is taking place.</P>
  <P>Anyway, Holme is being kept slightly more busy because he has now agreed to make regular reports to the federal executive on the general election campaign, following the row over this in December.</P>

  <A NAME="04"></A><HR><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><IMG ALIGN=TEXTTOP SRC="../rb2.gif"> Educating Donnie</H2>
  <P>The Liberal Democrats' obsession with tackling tough decisions which they do not need to tackle has found its latest expression in proposals for student support. These would allow for individual learning accounts, of which students would then have to repay part.</P>
  <P>The federal policy committee desired to know from spokesman Don Foster what the grant element in this would be. Would this cover tuition costs? Would students still have some grant for maintennace? Foster was unable to answer, and eventually called in David Laws, who had done the costings, on the grounds that Laws understood these while no-one else did. The current proposals would effectively require students to borrow some 2,500 compared with the 1,000-odd under the Government's current system. What is more, repayment would be at a higher rate than at present. This sounds a real vote winner among students and their parents, especially as any canvasser called upon to defend it can always come up with the convincing response that it must be right because the person who wrote it understands it. As Paddy Ashdown ruefully admitted, "I don't think we will get this through conference."</P>

  <A NAME="05"></A><HR><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><IMG ALIGN=TEXTTOP SRC="../rb2.gif"> Knowing Something We Don't</H2>
  <P>Welcome Emma Nicholson, particularly as the rather limited history of Tory defectors, compared to the rather more extensive one of Labour defectors, suggests that those leaving the Tories are moving to the left, while those from Labour are on an ever-rightward trajectory.</P>
  <P>At least David Steel has not this time told the would-be recruit to go away and form her own party, as happened when Roy Jenkins applied to the Liberals in 1980, precipitating the wasted decade of the Alliance.</P>
  <P>As one reader of <IMG SRC="../name.gif" ALT="Liberator"> wrote on his subscription renewal, "this must be the first example of Lord Holme persuading someone to join the party rather than leave it".</P>
  <P>The strangest part of the saga is that the Liberal Democrats were among the last to know what was afoot. For weeks prior to Christmas, Westminster had been alive with speculation that one or more west country Tories were poised to defect.</P>
  <P>So intense was this that national newspapers were making daily check calls, and the Labour Party was discreetly trying to find out when the Liberal Democrats would unveil their catch, so as not to plan any activity of their own which might be overshadowed by this coup.</P>
  <P>But the Liberal Democrats knew nothing until Nick Harvey jokingly asked Nicholson what the rumours were about, and she gave her now well-known positive response.</P>
  <P>Holme was enlisted to open delicate negotiations with Nicholson via mutual friends of her husband in the book industry.</P>
  <P>The flurry of rumours in December suggests there may be a real possibility of further defections. Nicholson is reliably reported to have happily accepted Liberal Democrat policies without any significant reservation. She was anyway respected for her independent views as a Tory, in particular for her campaigns in favour of the marsh arabs of Iraq. People like her are welcome.</P>
  <P>But the last thing the Liberal Democrats need is a defection of lots of Tories who want a small beach on which they can be large pebbles until their mates succeed in retaking control of their old party, when they can defect back.</P>
  <P>The recent antics of those social democrats who have redefected to Labour shows the danger of throwing open the doors to all and sundry just because they are famous.</P>
  <P>The only dissent over Nicholson comes from Liberal Democrat gay activists. She was the Tory signatory to the declaration of the UN Year of Tolerance. This included equality of sexual orientation, to which she felt, at least then, unable to put her name.</P>

  <A NAME="06"></A><HR><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><IMG ALIGN=TEXTTOP SRC="../rb2.gif"> Foul!</H2>
  <P>Twickenham is one of the Liberal Democrats' main target seats. Matters cannot surely have been helped by the abrupt resignation of its agent Mark Jeffries, after a very brief spell in office. This has now been followed by persistent reports of an assault in a local party meeting. Surely this cannot have been what all the general election talk about 'gearing up for battle' was really about.</P>

  <A NAME="07"></A><HR><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><IMG ALIGN=TEXTTOP SRC="../rb2.gif"> Lost Orders Please</H2>
  <P>We hear that Liberal Democrat members of the Association of District Councils were rather taken aback at a recent meeting to be told by their deputy leader, Congleton's Linda Short, that they could not inspect their group's draft standing orders. The astounded councillors were told that this was because this prize artefact was in the possession of the Cheshire rozzers. They are apparently investigating allegations concerning Congleton, and had swept up this innocent document with others.</P>

  <A NAME="08"></A><HR><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><IMG ALIGN=TEXTTOP SRC="../rb2.gif"> English Translation</H2>
  <P>In days gone by, western observers would try to deduce what was really going in the Soviet Union from a study of the nuances of Pravda reports of official events. Work is available for unemployed Sovietologists in the decoding of Liberal Democrat News reports of the federal executive.</P>
  <P>Readers of <A HREF="../233/index.htm"><IMG BORDER=0 SRC="../name.gif" ALT="Liberator"> 233</A> will be well aware that there was a substantial row in December between most federal executive members and Lord Holme over the accountability of the general election campaign team. Neither this nor the substance of it was secret, since leading party figures could speak of little else in the following weeks.</P>
  <P>Yet LDN described this as "the need for effective cooperation between the election team and the federal executive was emphasised". What was more, "a number of matters were discussed". Thus in LibDemspeak, 'emphasising effective cooperation' seems to bear the same meaning as "frank and comradely discussions" did in the Soviet bloc, a phrase used usually prior to someone falling from favour and being shot. Discussing 'a number of matters' means 'enormous row', when translated into English.</P>
  <P>But even <IMG SRC="../name.gif" ALT="Liberator">'s finest linguistic scholars have to admit defeat in trying to discover from LDN the exact status of the newly-ennobled Dick Taverne.</P>
  <P>It described as 'heading the list' of gongs, the OBE award for Mike German. This was followed by MBEs. Only then did we come to the life peerage, which would normally be regarded as more 'head of the list' than an OBE.</P>
  <P>One went to Dick Taverne, the premature social democrat of the 1970s, who was nominated by prime minister John Major, but is expected to join the Liberal Democrat bench in the Lords, a status which still does not put him head of the list, so is he or not? At least Paddy Ashdown did not waste a Liberal Democrat nomination on him, which would have fuelled the quite justified discontent over the number of peerages for those who spent the 1970s campaigning for Labour, compared to those for longstanding Liberals.</P>

  <A NAME="09"></A><HR><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><IMG ALIGN=TEXTTOP SRC="../rb2.gif"> Off The Air</H2>
  <P>The Government's broadcasting bill, now before parliament, has afforded the Liberal Democrat policy committee a convenient excuse to jettison the embarrassing media policy proposals which were being promoted by Robert Maclennan, Chris Huhne, and er, that's about it.</P>
  <P>These (<IMG SRC="../name.gif" ALT="Liberator"> 226 and 230) were worse than the Government's plans, where control of diversity of ownership was concerned, and wanted one regulator to supervise the entire print and broadcast media, an act of centralisation of power which would have made Kim-Il Sung blush.</P>
  <P>The policy committee, despite a body of evidence to the contrary, knows a dodo when it sees it. It seized upon the new bill, arguing that the Liberal Democrats could hardly develop a media policy when the legal position was in a state of flux.</P>
  <P>Huhne, though, has for no very obvious reason been awarded a seat on the committee charged with drafting the general election manifesto.</P>
  <P>It is of course quite unthinkable that anything in a policy paper which never got put to conference should surface in the manifesto, isn't it?</P>

  <A NAME="10"></A><HR><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><IMG ALIGN=TEXTTOP SRC="../rb2.gif"> Seats On Top</H2>
  <P>There were red faces in the London Liberal Democrats when an internal newsletter was leaked to the Independent, which stated quite truthfully that the party was short of candidates in London, and appealed for anyone "remotely interested" to apply. Simon Hughes was obliged to issue a reply, which stressed that there would be a Liberal Democrat candidate in every seat in the capital, and spoke of 'healthy competition' for approvals.</P>
  <P>There are some seats of course in every region where it does not much matter whether a candidate is in place four years or four hours before the deadline.</P>
  <P>Something has to be done about the well-intentioned but slow candidate approval system. It is surely time for some sort of fast track approval process entitling those who pass to fight only a specific seat, or a category of less promising ones, rather than indefinite approval everywhere.</P>

  <A NAME="11"></A><HR><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><IMG ALIGN=TEXTTOP SRC="../rb2.gif"> Fashion Plate</H2>
  <P>Every man has his price, so what is Sir David Steel's? For years Steel was well-known for always wearing a striped shirt with a white collar (not the same one all the time of course). Yet in semi-retirement he has taken up modelling something without a white collar called a 'pinpoint stripe'. This is made by Charles Tyrwhitt, purveyor of gents shirting. What can have caused this change of long-standing loyalties? Is in anything to do with image consultant Mary Spillane (<IMG SRC="../name.gif" ALT="Liberator"> 232) who has been telling credulous Liberal Democrats how to dress. The next page of Mr Tyrwhitt's catalogue carries an advertisement for 'Presenting Yourself, a personal image guide for men', by Ms Spillane.</P>

  <A NAME="12"></A><HR><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><IMG ALIGN=TEXTTOP SRC="../rb2.gif"> Stoned</H2>
  <P>Poor Bob Maclennan. It cannot be everyday that the Liberal Democrats' president is found in the street throwing stones at a window. But that is what happened when he arrived for the November conference committee meeting late and could not get in. Members eventually heard him and took pity. But at least he was there, which is more than can be said for Charles Anglin. It did not escape members attention that it is now two years since both federal policy committee representatives attended the conference committee at the same time.</P>

  <A NAME="13"></A><HR><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><IMG ALIGN=TEXTTOP SRC="../rb2.gif"> Simon Says, and says, and says</H2>
  <P>Move are afoot to draft Diana Maddock as Liberal Democrat Youth and Students president after a successful speech at their London conference. Simon Hughes damaged his chances of re-election in two ways. He did little to dispel the impression that he was aligned to the defeated Philip Jones/ Charles Anglin slate, and made an unscheduled closing speech which went on for an hour and crowded out debates. Hughes is usually reliable for a rousing call to arms, but on this occasion one delegate was seen sound asleep.</P>

  <A NAME="14"></A><HR><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><IMG ALIGN=TEXTTOP SRC="../rb2.gif"> Liberal Assembly Derailed</H2>
  <P>The Tories have frustrated the Liberal Party in the attempt to carry their Assembly to their Cornish heartland. The problem is one of getting a train out of Cornwall on a Sunday. Even trains from Plymouth don't easily tie in with getting delegates back to the far flung corners of the kingdom. As a compromise, the Assembly, which takes place between 27th and 29th September, will be back at Weston-Super-Mare. Dave Profitt, of the Party's national office in Southport,said it had brought home the full extent of what the government has done to the railways and their general neglect of the South West in a wholly unpredicted way. Would the Assembly be frustrated further by a general election? The Liberal Party says its manifesto is ready to run, but candidates have only been selected in two seats so far.</P>

  <A NAME="15"></A><HR><H2 ALIGN=CENTER><IMG ALIGN=TEXTTOP SRC="../rb2.gif"> Monstrous Erection</H2>
  <P>The desperate attempts of New Labour to appear almost normal could have suffered yet another set back... and its got nothing to do with where toffs send their kids to school. The following letter recently appeared in the East London Advertiser...</P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
   <P>"Pick your new priestess right now</P>
   <P>For many years the Temple of Isis has been fighting against the psycho-geographical male-female imbalance caused by the erection of the monstrous phallic obelisk of Canary Wharf on the ley line linking the evil obelisks of Pharaoh Tethmosis III (ie Cleopatra's Needle) and St Stephen's Tower (ie Big Ben).</P>
   <P>This was designed by arch occultists Pugin and Barry as a symbol of the patriarchal; power of Parliament (it is no coincidence that suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst was imprisoned in St Stephen's Tower in 1902).</P>
   <P>But thanks to invocations and psychic manipulation by the Temple of Isis and our trained, psychically gifted agents operating deep within the Labour Party the malign throb of patriarchy is ceasing to beat so strongly.</P>
   <P>A fruit of our spiritual labour has been the decision for an all-women shortlist for MP for Tower Hamlets.</P>
   <P>All contenders have been elevated as honorary Hand-maidens of the Temple of Isis and should be addressed as such. The chosen candidate will become an Archpriestess.</P>
   <P>Unfortunately we will have to ask those not selected to willingly offer themselves up for sacrifice, but that's politics for you.</P>
   <P>Karen Elliot, Total Maximum High Priestess."</P>

  <P>There are seven such contenders, however the Old Patriarchy of the Labour Party stirs itself. Smart money is on Kumar Murshid for the Bethnal Green & Bow division, unless Councillor Assad, chairman of education, splits the vote.</P>

      <H2>British Elections & Parties Yearbook 1994</H2>
      <H3>edited by David Broughton & others.<BR>Frank Cass 1995</H3>
    </CENTER>
    <P>Here's one for you train-spotters. An academic view of events in the body politic over the period 1992-93 in the main, but going beyond the scope of previous editions in that papers are not purely those presented at the conference of the Elections, Public Opinion & Parties group of the Political Studies Association.</P>
    <P>Now read on.</P>
    <P>So what can you remember from those dark days? Labour was seeking to divest itself of Trades Union influence and tentatively mooted the prospect of all women selection in a rather limited number of Parliamentary seats.</P>
    <P>The 1992 General Election was still in recent memory and analysis was pouring out. Patrick Syed and Paul Whiteley tell us that local campaigning had a considerable impact on the Tory vote in 1992- some lessons there.</P>
    <P>Iain McLain and Jeremy Smith found that the impact of the Poll Tax on electoral registration made grim reading. They reckon that the Tories would have won ten fewer seats had 40% of those not registering voted Labour or Lib Dem (Brecon, Edinburgh West, Portsmouth South) in those divisions. Given Labour's active encouragement of the Poll Tax refuseniks this is especially depressing reading now. Amusing on the Peasant's Revolt, but skip the mathematics.</P>
    <P>The real meat for most <IMG SRC="../name.gif" ALT="Liberator"> readers however will be Lynne Bennie, John Curtice and Wolfgang Rudig on the political identity of Liberals, Social Democrats and Liberal Democrats. Some of you will remember the survey that arrived around the time of the Torquay conference- well these are the results.</P>
    <P>The survey found that as far as most Lib Dems are concerned "the fault lines of the old Alliance have been removed" and it the merger has by and large been successful. Ideological differences between former members of the Liberal Party and the SDP prove something of a paradox. The former Social Democrats are found to be more conventionally liberal on moral issues than former members of the Liberal Party. Is this a case of local power corrupts? On economic issues Social Democrats are found more to the right, completing a trend which began under Owen and which has disturbing repercussions in the Liberal Democrats, in the recent work of the Media Panel for example. Thank goodness Conrad Russell is there to fight the corner.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, the authors conclude, the impact of the SDP was slight. This may seem perfectly obvious now, so was it worth all the pain? There are no short cuts in politics.</P>

      <H2>The Lost World</H2>
      <H3>Michael Crichton<BR>Century, 1995, 15.99</H3>
    </CENTER>
    <P>Correctly sold as the successor to Jurassic Park, this continues the story of the disastrous genetically engineered theme park. The story of the failed contract has been suppressed with gagging contracts but there are stories of strange reptiles being sighted in Costa Rica, and a paleontologist follows clues that lead to an island off the central American coast, where he becomes marooned.</P>
    <P>A relief expedition sets out including Ian Malcolm and the mad mathematician who has survived a previous ordeal in Jurassic Park. Two children conveniently manage to stow away, providing scope for the book to be filmed as family entertainment.</P>
    <P>A commercial rival also seeks the secrets of the theme park,  and to steal some of the dinosaur eggs, with fatal consequences. Both groups end up on the island which has been the breeding laboratory for the theme park.</P>
    <P>It is as if the lost world has been created on the island of Dr Moreau. The narrative covers various theories of evolution and the mass extinction of the dinosaurs, and the island at first sight looks like offering some clues. The explorers soon find out though that he population is too large and that there must have been a unnaturally low life expectancy. The dinosaurs have been reared initially on sheep offal resulting in a form of mad cow disease.</P>
    <P>The book ends with no conclusion about the extinction and one character even queries scientific theory to an extent which would appeal to religious fundamentalists. The explorers manage to escape having decided that a future expedition will be necessary. The story is fairly gripping but it has nothing new to add to Jurassic Park, and the reader is left with the conclusion that the main reason for any future expedition is to provide Michael Crichton with a lucrative source of income.</P>

      <H2>Ragged Schools, Ragged Children</H2>
      <H3>by Claire Seymour<BR>Ragged School Museum Trust 46-48 Copperfield Road, Stepney, London E3 4RR, 1995, 4.00</H3>
    </CENTER>
    <P>George Cruikshank's illustration on the cover says it all really. A dilapidated room, over-crowded with ramshackle children; some trying to learn, others trying but giving up, still more fighting, whilst a couple of toffs strain to keep on top of all this and impart some wisdom.</P>
    <P>The Ragged Schools were the sink schools of their day, from Robert Raikes' Sunday Schools of 1783 through to the end of the next century. The Forster Education Act and its successors were their undoing as they inevitably lacked the resources to keep pace with demands for higher standards, but survived awhile for the very destitute and no doubt the very disorderly.</P>
    <P>Seymour is mercifully unsanctimonious about Barnardo and his ilke. I regret that worthy though he may be, this part of the National Myth was delivered at least once a year throughout most of my school days. The effect of  getting the children some education, shelter and welfare is laudable, but one wonders about the intent - social control through religion.</P>
    <P>A good little book, and a good little museum. Since it is run largely by volunteers opening hours are few (tel. 0181-980-6405), but for any teachers struggling to meet the National Curriculum they run excellent Victorian classes.</P>

      <H2>High Life in Verdopolis</H2>
      <H3>by Charlotte Bronte<BR>The British Library 1995</H3>
    </CENTER>
    <P>Written at the age of seventeen, this piece of ephemera, generously released by the British Library after 161 years, would be of little interest were it not for the author's subsequent reputation. As it is, part of the Glass Town saga of the precocious Bronte childhood, it is a fascinating precursor of things to come.</P>
    <P>Beyond this, it is a mirror of the impact of Romanticism and current events on the young mind. Despite the sway of Byron and his implicit radicalism, Bronte's hero worship ultimately draws her to the more dominant conservative elements of both. Within the book the tensions between the balance of compassion between Liberalism and Conservatism rage.</P>
    <P>It remains a work for the enthusiast, the literary detective or the lover of fine books. Illustrated with works by the author. Both attractive and charming.</P>

      <H2>The Avengers: Cathy Gale volume 2</H2>
      <H3>Lumiere Pictures Ltd, 1995, 10.99</H3>
    </CENTER>
    <P><CITE>"You have a surprising faith in gentlemen's agreements, Mr. Teddy Bear - but perhaps you have noticed, I'm not a gentleman."</CITE></P>
    <P>'Mr. Teddy Bear' was the first episode broadcast (although they're being released in production, not transmission order) featuring Honor Blackman as Mrs. Gale. Even today, she's an unusually strong woman character, so the impact she had 10 years before I was born was huge. An anthropologist with a flat designed in the style of her old home in Africa, she's resourceful, handy with a gun or a motorbike, but with a hard moral edge. This brings her into conflict with Patrick Macnee's Steed, at that time a shady ruthless character under the mannered veneer of brolly and bowler: coldly threatening a petty crook; laced with black humour; suggesting a kneecapping; and professionally appreciative of the assassin Mr. Teddy Bear (much to Cathy's disapproval).</P>
    <P>Mr. Teddy Bear is expensive, but effective - whether you  want a macabre practical joke or a public execution, his speciality is death by gadget. The opening killing is particularly ingenious, as is the moving teddy bear through which the killer communicates (in many way a template for later larger-than-life Avengers masterminds). He even has a believable background, though he's a little disappointing in the flesh. Clearly not as stylised as the programme later became, with ordinary sets and primitive cameras, the story is at times slow-paced, but overall it's an effective thriller with a twist. Both Steed and Cathy stand out as superb.</P>
    <P><CITE>"All right. Forty - five shillings a share."<BR>"The brigadier offered me forty-five and six. And a much better seduction too."</CITE></P>
    <P>'Bullseye', the second episode on this tape, is a tale of Stock Exchange skullduggery and gun-running to tribal wars.  It showcases Mrs. Gale (who gets an unarmed combat scene here) at her best, taking the controlling shares in an armaments firm under threat of take-over by business tycoon with a nasty reputation, where the other major shareholders are dying mysterious deaths...</P>
    <P> Steed is kept to a minimal role, supplying Cathy with money, information and innuendo-laden banter with bounces off her iron rectitude. The director keeps a tight script taut with suspense, with scenes such as that where Cathy is framed for murder particularly effective. It lacks the occasional flamboyance of the earlier story, but is sinister enough to make a more satisfying whole. In all, the tape is a fascinating flashback to the thriller style that launched The Avengers, with plotting and performances which more than make up for some creakiness.</P>

      <H2>Seven</H2>
      <H3>(Director David Fincher Cert 18)</H3>
    </CENTER>
    <P>This is a film with some style, right from the uniquely designed credits. Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are reluctantly teamed up as a pair of detectives trying to trace a serial killer with a bizarre philosophical bent. The detectives' task is to make the connection behind a series of killings where the victims are apparently guilty of one of the seven deadly sins. The sub plot revolves around Freeman's bleak view of New York city life and his longed for imminent retirement to a log cabin; the fear of the city expressed by Pitt's wife (played by Gwyneth Paltrow); and the simplistic pursuit of justice from Pitt, the typically 90's angry young man.</P>
    <P>The visual device of darkness in so many of the scenes is effective, requiring more than the usual suspension of belief. But this is a modern film with style, sensitivity, and a brooding sense of violence, which is only gruesome in its after effects rather than from its on screen portrayal. Building to a logical but blinding climax this is the best American thriller on screen for some time. Watch out for the OSCAR nominations.</P>

      <H2>Heavy</H2>
      <H3>(Director James Mangold Cert 15)</H3>
    </CENTER>
    <P>This is a small, slow-moving film of closely observed emotions set in a run down small town American diner. A  lonely hopelessness pervades the life of all the characters but especially the central protagonist Victor (played brilliantly by Pruitt Taylor Vince); a fat, shy 30-something, who is the diner's chef living in the shadow of his dominating mother. An anti-hero of few words he communicates mostly from almost imperceptible nods of the head, but it his coping with his late awakening to women and the loss of his mother which is the film's central character study.</P>
    <P>An effective sound track, with original music from Thurston Moore, adds to the gloom and a sense of foreboding. However the film has a gently portrayed upbeat ending which in its way completes the coming of age of Victor. Co-starring Shelley Winters, Deborah Harry and newcomer Liv Tyler, the supporting cast provide sympathetic and natural performances.</P>
    <P>Heavy will not attract those moviegoers who want to see some action for their cinema entry fee. But for those who have the time to use the contemplative mood of the piece to reflect on the simple messages of the film, its worth an afternoon's visit.</P>

      <H2>Land and Freedom</H2>
      <H3>(Director Ken Loach Cert 15)</H3>
    </CENTER>
    <P>I have never truly understood what the Spanish Civil War was about and the underlying reasons why Franco won, and anyone else admitting to the same level of ignorance could do worse than take a look at this. Ken Loach managed to attract an impressive array of backers from various European sources to make the film, which just goes to show that one can make historical dramas, with extras and battle scenes, without relying on the resources of Hollywood.</P>
    <P>Whilst it is an ambitiously bigger canvas than is usual for this director, there are still the tell tale signs that this is unquestionably a Ken Loach film, and that Ken Loach is uncompromisingly a socialist. The story is told in flashback from modern times as a grand daughter discovers her grandfather's mementos of the Civil War period after his death.</P>
    <P>The film effectively conveys the monotony of the war from the view of the trenches although does not question the need for it. A typically Loach scene is the staged debate between the conquering heroes of a people's militia, and the local villagers after their liberation from Franco's forces. Focusing on the difference between a possible collectivisation of the village lands and the division of the landowner's estate between the villagers, it demonstrates in minutiae the fatal flaw in the approach of the anti-Franco forces. With different agendas and definitions of socialism the coalition is bound to collapse. And so it proves as the tale unwinds. This is not a film for the faint-hearted, as there are some truly violent and emotional moments, and the optimism portrayed in the final scenes is painfully naive. Nevertheless this is well made, and recommended viewing.</P>

      <H2>Leaving Las Vegas</H2>
      <H3>(Director Mike Figgis Cert 18)</H3>
    </CENTER>
    <P>This is a vehicle for the remarkable central performance of Nicolas Cage, who plays a self-confessed alcoholic who is about to deliberately slide down the slippery slope to oblivion. Selling all his assets and clearing his credit card bill he turns up in Las Vegas from Los Angeles determined to drink himself to death. Seeking companionship rather than sex he befriends a prostitute played by Elizabeth Shue who, in her own life, is in an habitually enslaved relationship with a pimp who has a vicious line in punishment involving scarring her legs with a knife when her takings are too low.</P>
    <P>But this subtext is not so much complementary but more a distraction to the main focus, which is an outstanding character study into the behaviour of an alcoholic with a death wish. Cage displays the tell tale behaviour of a  chronic alcoholic - the horror of early morning sobriety when the shakes in his hand prevent him from signing a cheque at the bank; the mild inebriation which allows him to engage in wry humour, the tell tale signs of drunkenness when he becomes accident prone leading to rage and violence, and finally the near comatose fits of a body suffering from acute alcohol poisoning.</P>
    <P>This is a modern tragedy with a believable anti-hero for which the audience can feel real sympathy. Not a fun film by any means, although there are some exceptionally funny episodes between the periods of dark despair, but essentially a great study of nihilistic values set against the back drop of the ultimate materialistic culture which is Las Vegas.</P>

      <H2>Winston Churchill as I knew Him</H2>
      <H3>by Violet Bonham Carter<BR>Wiedenfeld & Nicholson 1995 14.99</H3>
    </CENTER>
    <P>Lady Violet's recollections cover the period from 1906 to 1916, when Churchill stepped down as First Lord of the Admiralty following the disastrous Gallipoli campaign. The book deals mostly with events that are commonly recorded elsewhere, but with the insight of Lady Violet's personal and family (she was the daughter of Herbert Asquith) experiences. Churchill at the time of their first meeting was 32 and she 19. Shortly before he had joined the Liberal government, having been increasingly uncertain about the Conservative Party since early 1904, principally because of Joseph Chamberlain's protectionism. This issue was quite clearly splitting the Conservatives but, rather like his successor John Major, Balfour refused to go. Churchill was first adopted by the Liberals in North West Manchester as a Free Trade candidate, wherefore he increasingly drifted towards the Liberal ranks. By-elections reduced the Tory majority from 134 to 68.</P>
    <P>The 1906 general election which followed saw the demonstrations of the suffragettes. Although Churchill supported women's suffrage, he riposted in the face of a demonstration at one of his campaign meetings that he was not going to be hen-pecked over the issue, becoming something of a byword in the election. Defending one of the neighbouring constituencies to that which Churchill fought, Arthur Balfour was himself defeated. As we know, 377 Liberals were elected, whilst their supporters numbered 513 within the House of Commons to only 157 Tories. Can we look forward to something of a repeat over the next 18 months? Not Liberals alas.</P>
    <P>With a view to the next general election, it is interesting that in those days a by-election was fought when a Member of Parliament was elevated to the Cabinet. Defending as he was a traditional Tory seat, Churchill perhaps not surprisingly lost the ensuing by-election in 1907, being duly elected for a safe seat in Dundee shortly afterwards. However it also demonstrates a party's ability to recover from a seemingly disastrous electoral setback, and is a matter which might guide Liberal Democrat strategy during the next parliament.</P>
    <P>It was at Dundee that Churchill gave the classic definition of the difference between Liberalism and Socialism.</P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>Socialism seeks to pull down wealth: Liberalism seeks to raise up poverty. Socialism would destroy private interests; Liberalism would preserve private interest in the only way which they can be safely and justly preserved namely, by reconciling them with public right. Socialism will kill enterprise; Liberalism would rescue enterprise from trammels of privilege and preference. Socialism assails the pre- eminence of the individual; Liberalism seeks, and shall seek more in the future, to build up a minimum standard for the mass. Socialism exalts the rule; Liberalism exalts the man...</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>Of her father's first Cabinet, Lady Violet points out that it was quite an achievement to hold together such men as Lloyd George, Edward Grey, Churchill, Haldane, Morley, Samuel, and John Burns together, without a single resignation until the First World War; the more so when one considers the agenda of that government. Churchill and Lloyd George rapidly formed a partnership. She says of them</P>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>Winston was an intellectual who arrived at his conclusions through his mind though his heart often reinforced it; intellectually Lloyd George had few convictions; his thought was not rooted in any consistent or abiding principals, his mind had no anchor. He lived by instinct and it served him well; he was an improviser of genius and an emotional opportunist.</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>Much of the book is anecdotal around events of Parliament, particularly the problems with the House of Lords veto which are gone into in some detail. Vitriol from the Tory benches was particularly directed at Churchill as a turncoat. However, perhaps because we are dealing with one ruling class in both the main parties it is perhaps the case that consensus was more easily achieved than in today's politics. The role of the dinner party or country weekend when politicians of all sides might meet socially shines through clearly in Lady Violet's account and is one of the obvious areas where she adds depth to the more general history.</P>
    <P>The causes of Churchill's departure to the trenches in 1916 are well known and sad to relate again. Herein lies the demise of Liberalism in British politics amongst other matters. Churchill was certainly headstrong; Cable Street demonstrated that much earlier. Politicians were more honourable persons in those days than would appear to be the case today.</P>
    <P>Lady Violet's book came out shortly after Sir Winston Churchill's death. It is not the definitive document on the man or the period, but adds insight and depth to our knowledge of both, making it a must for any Liberal interested in those times.</P>

      <H2>The Wrong Men</H2>
      <H3>by Jill Morrell<BR>Obtainable from Bridgewater Four Support Group, 723 Pershore Road, Selly Park, Birmingham 29. 2.95 + 1 p&p</H3>
    </CENTER>
    <P>This booklet will be particularly useful to those unfamiliar with the facts surrounding the murder of paper boy Carl Bridgewater at Yew Tree Farm, Staffs., in 1978; those who haven't read Paul Foot's Murder at the Farm (Penguin 1993) or missed the three television documentaries between 1978 and 1993.</P>
    <P>There is a brief history of the case, the narrative of the campaign from conviction in 1979 to 1995 and an appendix refuting the prosecution case. Space denies the author the chance to effectively rubbish the logistics of the prosecution case. It was impossible for the defendants to have reached the scene of the crime before 3.30 pm, whereas witnesses state that vehicles were seen at the farm from 12.25 pm until 4.55 pm.</P>
    <P>Apart from the logistics, the case has striking similarities to other major miscarriages of justice in the last twenty-five years. Two of the defendants who subsequently changed their stories implicated the other two. One died in custody. The involvement of our friends the West Midlands Police. The acceptance by the court of hearsay evidence of conversations in prison between the defendants and a prison officer and other prisoners. The presence of another suspect near the scene at the time of the murder, and the very great pressure upon the police to make an arrest, particularly as Devon & Cornwall Police had failed to find the body of paper girl Genette Tate who had been abducted a month prior to Carl's murder.</P>
    <P>Liberals of all persuasions should galvanise their local party; so far Labour has made all the running. After brooding for two and a half years Michael Howard says he is "not minded" to refer the case back to the Court of Appeal, despite a wealth of new evidence.</P>

      <H2>The New Arden Shakespeare</H2>
      <H3>King Henry V Editor TW Craik:  Titus Andronicus  Editor Jonathan Bate: Antony and Cleopatra. Editor John Wilders<BR>Routledge, hardback and paperback.</H3>
    </CENTER>
    <P>Arden 2 once seemed the definitive word on Shakespeare, but in recent years new critical movements have made it seem out of date. Increasingly, the demand has been for a text that puts Shakespeare back in the theatre and Arden 3 attempts to do that, with emphasis firmly on the play in production and reference not only to the play's original staging but also to recent productions on stage and film. The volumes retain the clarity of the earlier Arden editions but with many new features, notably illustrations, maps, genealogical tables, suggestions for doubling and an extremely useful index. With the modern return to the bare stage used by the Elizabethans, the act and scene divisions which have no authorial justification have been printed very unobtrusively. This is obviously preferable as an acting version, but can make it less convenient as a study text.</P>
    <P>During the twentieth century, Henry V has often been dismissed merely as an imperialist celebration of national glory in which Shakespeare wisely showed his support for the Tudors. Lawrence Olivier's film version, whilst being an unforgettable film, was used for wartime propaganda in a this way. In his very readable introduction, Craik outlines the various perspectives which critics old and new have attempted to put on the play and brings it up to date with reference both to new historicism and cultural materialism.</P>
    <P>Craik does not attempt to join the debate, leaving it to the student to assess the play for him or herself. There is a full discussion of the early printing history and a particularly fascinating appendix gives a facsimile of the complete First Quarto of 1600, a version of the play which interestingly did not contain either the choruses or the Harfleur speech, Once more unto the breach,' probably the best known parts of the play for a modern audience. Could it be that this nationalistic play was originally staged without these most telling elements? The inclusion of maps of Henry's campaign and his family tree are particularly helpful today when the historical background may not be as familiar as it was to earlier generations.</P>
    <P>If Henry V merits new appraisal, does Titus Andronicus have anything to offer a twentieth century audience? Roman politics and the niceties of revenge tragedy seem far removed from the concerns of our society. Yet Titus Andronicus was not only extremely successful in Elizabethan times but also in modern productions, most notably that of Deborah Warner with Sonia Ritter as the rape victim, Lavinia. Of the three plays represented here, Titus Andronicus would seem to be the most inaccessible, but Jonathan Bate is an ardent and able champion of the play. Whereas earlier editors seemed almost apologetic, often unwilling to attribute the work to Shakespeare or detecting Strong indications of another hand,' Jonathan Bate, whilst acknowledging some problems, is a powerful advocate and his enthusiasm is infectious. He argues that its aesthetics and politics are sophisticated and complicated, deserving a wider audience, moreover that in its willingness to confront violence our culture has affinities with the sixteenth century.</P>
    <P>Titus Andronicus tells the story of a victorious Roman General who loses 21 of his 25 sons in the wars, kills his youngest in an unjust quarrel and then discovers his daughter shockingly raped and mutilated - all a trifle careless as Lady Bracknell might have said. The framework of the play is the revenge which Tamora seeks for the loss of her son sacrificed by Titus and the counter revenge which Titus pursues after the rape of his daughter by Tamora's other sons. Finally, Titus kills his daughter and cooks and serves up her rapists in a pie at a dinner to which he invites their mother, Tamora. Hardly, one might suppose, the ingredients of a successful drama, but Shakespeare was writing in a genre that was highly popular at the time, that of the revenge tragedy, which often contained elements of black humour and in which the obligations of personal versus public revenge could legitimately be explored. Public executions and bloody sports were then a popular form of entertainment. Today, we claim to be more civilised than the Elizabethans, but civil wars not only in the third world but also in Europe bear witness to the same barbarism, cruelty, and desire for revenge; meanwhile films with themes of torture, rape and cannibalism are box office sell-outs.</P>
    <P>If we still feel that rape and mutilation are not appropriate subjects for a play, Bate suggests that one reason why Warner's version was successful was because, as a twentieth century woman director, rape mattered more to her than it could ever have done to Shakespeare and this enabled her to show Lavinia as a real suffering person. This may be so, but the world of Titus Andronicus is wholly male orientated. Though Deborah Warner moved towards a realistic representation of Lavinia's feelings, Lavinia can only be shown from the outside, from the masculine viewpoint. After the savage attack, tongueless and with no hands, she has no way either of communicating her feelings or of identifying her attackers; though an educated woman, she does not even think of scratching words on the ground - that has to be suggested to her by a man. She is predominantly an object of pity, a visual symbol of her violation, but hardly a full human being. As for Titus, it is difficult to be fully sympathetic to a man who has taken his sons to the war and lost twenty-one of them, killed another in an unjust quarrel and then murdered his daughter because he is too sensitive to stand the sight of her.</P>
    <P>Antony and Cleopatra has seldom been out of favour and therefore needs no apologist: perhaps for that reason it seems more predictable than the other two volumes. The introduction is just as readable and takes modern criticism into account, but perhaps the approach has been made more with the new reader or good A-level student in mind rather than the advanced student. Little has changed in attitudes towards Cleopatra. If she is not condemned for ensnaring Antony, she is still condemned because she equivocates after his death. Wilders allows that Antony commits suicide in the knowledge that he has lost both the empire and Cleopatra. She, however, is condemned for pausing to wonder whether she has any future under Caesar and for opting for an easy way to die. Since she has just seen the consequences of Antony's bodged attempt it would seem sensible rather than cowardly to do so.</P>
    <P>As with the other volumes, the emphasis is on living theatre and contains an outline of its acting history. Antony and Cleopatra was subject to some of the most extreme experiments in opulent spectacle so beloved of the Victorians; one performance in 1890 lasted over four hours! Wilders shows how the play gains in clarity from simplicity of scenery and rapidity of performance. The muted act and scene divisions mentioned earlier allow the many changes of scene to flow much more smoothly even in the study, showing how the play works successfully without distractions of frequent scene changes. However for ease of reference it might be helpful if the scene numbers could be indicated a little more clearly. The notes are always full and there is some extremely helpful background information with reference to the historical sources. Wilders also discusses some of the omissions made by Shakespeare for dramatic impact. The map of the Roman empire is particularly useful. In order to make room for these, the full extracts from Plutarch which were given in Arden 2 have been replaced with shorter quotations in the footnotes.</P>
    <P>These new Ardens are attractively produced to the same high standards as previous editions. Whilst the introductions of earlier editions were probably often ignored, these make fascinating reading. The inclusion of so much new material and up to date criticism means that they are considerably longer than their forerunners. They will continue to form part of every student's library. Their size makes it unlikely to be generally used in rehearsal but they should be an indispensable part of every informed actor's bookshelf.</P>

    <P>but will perhaps not sympathise with Birtill's socialist antics including flying the red flag from his Hampstead council flat in sympathy with the coup against Gorbachov! This collection, published by Torriano Poets, includes a cross-section of Paul's bitingly black humour (he once had a screenplay rejected by the BBC on the grounds that it needed to contain at least some redemption) and his angst-ridden Liverpool Catholic work.</P>

      <H2>Doctor Who - The Evil of the Daleks</H2>
      <H3>BBC Audio Collection, 7.99</H3>
    </CENTER>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"Somewhere in the Dalek race, there are three Daleks with the Human Factor. Gradually they will come to question. They will persuade other Daleks to question. You will have a rebellion on your planet!"</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>My political views came from some odd directions. While Weekending first got me interested in party politics, Doctor Who  was instrumental in converting me to liberalism. I read and re-read the novelisations of stories like Doctor Who and the Silurians  and The Green Death  (which even has Jeremy Thorpe as Prime Minister), with messages about tolerance, equality and ecology, and if the Doctor isn't the epitome of a do-your-own-thing, anarchic liberal, I don't know who is (if you'll excuse the pun).</P>
    <P>The Evil of the Daleks  was a seven-episode story. Thanks to BBC short-termism, only one episode remains on video, and this slightly fuzzy audio version only survives thanks to a fan's tape recorder (with typical grace, the BBC refused to credit him, claiming he shouldn't have taped them in the first place). This is a great shame, as only one video- released story beats it: The Deadly Assassin , which starred Tom Baker, whose moody tones narrate this feast for fans of the late, great Patrick Troughton. Script, performances, period detail and the Daleks for once being sinister, evil manipulators rather than seeming just stupid robots' all mark this out as something very special indeed. The plot revolves around the Doctor being lured to Victorian times by the Daleks to discover for them what makes humans so successful. While the Doctor manages to infect three Daleks with the Human Factor' to provoke a civil war, the Daleks' plan is also not what it seems. Patrick Troughton is utterly compelling as the Doctor, and the central message that questioning, self-reliant individuals must be championed over rigid authority makes this perhaps the most powerfully liberal Doctor Who  story ever made. Even stripped down to sound alone, it's also one of the two best.</P>

Neither the sex nor the drugs are particularly memorable, but then these are low life scum . . . . . .wear Converse All Stars, etc - fashion is important throughout and they're inclined to be a bit arty, if of a performance kind that extends to parties and topless gogo - yeah, this is art, art for parties sake.

      <H3>(Subtitled, Dir Valeri Todorovski Cert 18)</H3>
    </CENTER>
    <P>Although widely heralded by the mainstream press critics as a classic Russian film noir, I have to confess in being a little disappointed with the final product. Ingeborga Dapkunaite plays the put-upon heroine who is abandoned by an unloving husband more inclined to business than to reinforce his marriage. The poor creature is left to the wiles of her mother-in-law, a novelist, to whom she acts as a typist.</P>
    <P>As the scene moves to the country dacha a local carpenter, a brutish Lawrencian-style artisan takes Katia as a lover. The story's twist revolves around the aftermath of the mother-in- law's timely death. However the revenge motive is not convincingly portrayed in a central performance that is so wooden and expressionless that what could have been is largely a missed opportunity.</P>
    <P>There are better films to see than this.</P>

      <H2>Richard III</H2>
      <H3>(Director Richard Loncraine)</H3>
    </CENTER>
    <BLOCKQUOTE>"I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,<BR>Cheated of feature by dissembling nature ...<BR>Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,<BR>Have no delight to pass away the time."</BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>Watching Ian McKellan's incredible performance as the twisted Richard III, spinning from power, to charm, to a single moment of naked savagery, I remembered how this quotation introduced the Daleks' creator, Davros, in the best Doctor Who  novelisation. Perhaps the American resurrectors of the good Doctor could use some of their vast budget to hire McKellan, as Richard has never been more clearly Davros's glorious ancestor (even to the point of both being swathed in Nazi imagery).</P>
    <P>McKellan's Richard is one of the screen's finest villains, in one of the screen's finest adaptations of Shakespeare. I'm usually wary of modernised' Shakespeare, but this study in political evil could almost have been written for the 1930s. While the Queen being smeared with witchcraft jars in this context, it is noticeable because everything else fits. Turning the soliloquy I quote to a triumphant public speech that segues into a poisonous afterthought over the urinals, for example, uses the potential of a film in a way that too few interpreters have the imagination for.</P>
    <P>McKellan clearly enjoys himself tremendously, using unmistakable symbols of his wickedness while never lurching into pantomime villainy. The scene where he helps feed' a boar is cruelly funny, just as you know that Richard is the most despicable villain because no-one else could send the nationally beloved Nigel Hawthorne to an ignominious end.</P>
    <P>The fun is increased by McKellan's nods to other films - surely no other Shakespeare adaptation can have modelled its opening scene on Star Wars , or fashioned an ending of gloriously bad taste from White Heat  and An American Werewolf in London .</P>
    <P>The film paints a frighteningly compelling vision of an alternative 1930s, where it is Britain that insidiously slides from decadence to fascism, until suddenly you know that Nuremberg is just around the corner. Startling use is made of buildings that are hardly transformed - most notably Battersea Power Station as the Tower. The abdicated King Edward is clearly retained here with sly twists around his American wife and his infamous wimpy fascism swiftly replaced by Richard's real thing'. Edward Hardwicke's Stanley starts off militaristic and right-wing, in blue RAF uniform; one of the most chilling aspects of the film is the way the militarism gradually increases, until suddenly the civilians don black and Stanley is left looking like an old- fashioned pinko simply by standing still, rather like Roy Hattersley in today's Labour Party.</P>
    <P>Oddly, the flavour it leaves reminds me most not of films or of Shakespeare at all, but of the superb 1987 ITV series Knights of God, which only I and about three other people seem to have watched. That also had Britain ruled by fascists and a modern civil war, with the armoured vehicles driving in at the close to restore the real' monarchy . . . which just goes to show that I always love a good story, whatever its ideology. Mind you, the best character in that was the villain, just as in McKellan's film I was rooting for Richard all the way - it's criminal that the film has only garnered two minor OSCAR nominations. Go and see it. And boo the hero.</P>

      <H2>Heat</H2>
      <H3>(Dir Michael Mann Cert 15)</H3>
    </CENTER>
    <P>This is a crime thriller which reaches a standard rarely achieved by others. The two protagonists, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro play their parts in a chilling but largely predictable cat and mouse story. The detective (Pacino) has the typical policeman's failing third marriage and a disturbed step-daughter for additional emotional trauma. The big time crook (De Niro) is the cold and calculating emotional island who believes that anyone in his profession has to be prepared, if necessary, to walk out on any relationship within thirty seconds to guarantee survival.</P>
    <P>As is usual in this kind of movie the viewer gets a number of human interest subplots relating to the supporting cast which reflect the themes of the main storyline. And true to the genre we have the predictable final shoot out between the two principals at the end. So what makes it so good?</P>
    <P>It is because the central performances of Pacino and De Niro are superb. And they are at their best in a wryly comic scene when they confront each other over a coffee to discuss the possible outcome of the tale. (There is also an impeccable performance from Jon Voight playing the aging criminal Mr Fixit behind the scenes.)</P>
    <P>Despite the surprisingly mild 15 certificate the onscreen violence is realistic and therefore horrific as a consequence. To get the full effect a front row seat in a cinema with a Dolby stereo sound system will do the trick!</P>
    <P>But be warned, this is not a film for the faint hearted or one with sensitive hearing. But if you do like American crime thrillers then this is the best for some time.</P>

      <H3>(Dir Danny Boyle Cert 18)</H3>
    </CENTER>
    <P>Following all the hype and the frequent showing of one of the best trailers for some time, this film finally arrived on our screens on 23 February. Was it finally all it was cracked up to be? The simple answer is yes, and then some.</P>
    <P>The film is set in Edinburgh's 1980's drug culture where conventional consumerist values are rejected in favour of the instant hits from heroin shots. The cast of misfits brilliantly led from the front by Ewan McGregor as Renton, subsist in disgusting squats, so graphically portrayed that they create a bizarre twilight world for the viewer that matches the reality experienced by the drug addicts. There are no values, no morality on display here. But remarkably an overarching sense of fun pervades the piece despite its desperate characters and often gruesome action. Black comedy has never been so black.</P>
    <P>Danny Boyle's direction is stylish with a keen sense of the surreal which is at its best when Renton goes in search of drug infused suppositories in the most disgusting toilet in Scotland. To describe what happens on screen next would only spoil the fun.</P>
    <P>When our hero tries an alternative value-free world in London, he becomes an estate agent, which seems rather appropriate under the circumstances. After several relapses back into the drug world we are offered an upbeat ending, which when it is described in all its materialist detail, does not seem that much more enticing than the living hell we have just witnessed for 90 minutes. This is impressive British cinema. See it.</P>

      <H2>The Almanac of British Politics</H2>
      <H3>by Robert Waller and Byron Criddle<BR>Routledge 1996 25</H3>
    </CENTER>
    <P>As Simon Titley described the Elections Yearbook as "one for the trainspotters" <A HREF="../234/index.htm">(Liberator 234)</A>, then this must be an political anorak's dream. Every constituency laid out in glorious detail: demography, geography, history, previous members and candidates, boundary changes, party local election strongholds, quirks of constituency character and the odd prediction or two. Those with a professional interest in these things - like myself - will devour every paragraph. Casual activists will turn first to their own constituency, and then work through Lib Dem seats and targets. They are likely to be disappointed. Waller is Conservative with a big and a small 'c'. I have often rubbished the comments of previous editions, only to find them entirely justified on election night. If recent history has taught us anything, it is that caution is all in psephology.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, the picture may be better than Waller suggests. He forecasts the Lib Dems holding all present seats, save for question marks over Gordon, Inverness, and, curiously, Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale. He is optimistic about David Rendel's chances in Newbury, and Chris Davies's in Oldham East and Saddleworth, and looks to interesting battles in Christchurch and Eastleigh. There are predictions too of gains in St Ives, West Devon, Torbay, Somerton and Frome, Isle of Wight, Portsmouth South, Oxford West, Colchester, Hazel Grove and Southport, with discreet winks towards surprises in Salisbury and Mid Dorset. But elsewhere Waller is pretty scathing of Lib Dem chances.</P>
    <P>The problem is that publication of this book was delayed by legal fine-combing of the MPs' biographies (more anon), and it shows. Emma Nicholson is still "a moderate One Nation Tory aristocrat in a Lib Dem-threatened seat", whilst Alan Howarth is "assured of a life tenure of one of England's safest Tory seats" in the first paragraph, but has "dramatically joined Labour" in the second. More seriously, no account is taken of the May 1995 local elections, smearing egg-on-face over comments like "the Liberal Democrats have never achieved  dominance in local government" in Weston-super-Mare. Waller's predictions look less secure given this demonstration of the radically shifting political environment.</P>
    <P>By far the most entertaining part of the book is the thumb-nail sketches of MPs and leading challengers (Criddle's contribution). Reverence and deference do not get a look in. Anyone involved in higher education will surely allow a smirk at John Patten being remembered "for converting the polytechnics into universities, and vice-versa".</P>
    <P>On the whole, Lib Dems emerge relatively unscathed, apart from (or because of) a liberal scattering of words like "dull" and "uncharismatic". Bob Maclennan, we are reminded, is "the only contemporary MP to have been elected for three different parties in the same constituency....achieved       without igniting the heather or offering a single soundbite"; whilst if an exception must prove the rule, how about Liz Lynne, "an eye-catching figure in primary colours". Hours of fun.</P>

      <H2>Why I Am A Liberal Democrat</H2>
      <H3>edited by Duncan Brack<BR>Liberal Democrat Publications 1996 6.95</H3>
    </CENTER>
	 <P>Inspired by a similar volume 'Why I Am A Liberal' published in 1885, Duncan Brack wrote to a large number of leading Liberal Democrats and party sympathisers, asking them to write a few paragraphs explaining why they are Liberal Democrats. The result is over 100 short essays, and almost every one is a 'measure of the man' (or woman).</P>
	 <P>The best are those which combine the personal and the political, the emotional and the rational. I would include Earl Russell and Bernard Greaves, who both write with passion.</P>
	 <P>Some are ideologically spot-on but emotionally detached and reveal little of the author's personal motivation (Gordon Lishman, Alan Sherwell). Some are surprisingly good (Richard   Holme, Philip Goldenberg). Some  are long-winded manifestos (David Howarth), sometimes arranged in bullet-point form (Mike Bell), or as a numbered list with no shape or priorities (Paddy Ashdown). Some are shallow celebrity endorsements of the party which fail to go much beyond proportional representation and generally being nice (Barry Norman, Nicholas Parsons).</P>
	 <P>A certain generation regularly cites the Suez crisis and Jo Grimond as its formative influences (Michael Steed, Geoff Tordoff, Paul Tyler). One person (Tony Greaves) manages to combine the long-term vision with the short-term frustrations most of us experience. In doing so, Tony probably speaks best for most Liberator readers.</P>
	 <P>Above all, it's good to see Liberal Democrat Publications producing an ideological book instead of another cuddly toy or baseball cap. Does this signify a turning point in the party's attitude towards its own fundamental values? Is ideology finally coming out of the closet? Let's hope so.</P>

      <H2>Nixon</H2>
      <H3>(Dir Olive Stone, Cert 15)</H3>
    </CENTER>
    <P>Richard Nixon's dramatic downfall is just far enough away to be treated as history rather than as polemic on contemporary events.</P>
    <P>Even at the time, it was recognised that, while disgraced by Watergate and by campaign practices dubious even by American standards, Nixon had his achievement in the rapprochement with China.</P>
    <P>That shows the contradiction in Nixon. He might have been a crook at the head of a democracy. But unlike, say, the former leaders of Italy, he does not seem to have greatly enriched himself. Stone suggests that Nixon trusted no-one, not even Kissinger, but saw the ends he was striving for as great deeds. Thus he was not very particular about the means he used to win and keep the presidency.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the political life and formative years of such a  figure must be turned over thoroughly in a biographical film.</P>
    <P>But its single outstanding characteristic is its length, at 192 minutes. Quite honestly, it does not justify this. If Nixon lost 30 minutes or so it would rank as a remarkable achievement, because for most of the time it does hold attention. Crucial to this is Anthony Hopkins's impressive performance as Nixon, on screen almost the entire time.</P>
    <P>Towards the end, with Watergate bringing his world crashing down, I started wishing that Nixon would sign his resignation letter and clear off without yet another self-justificatory soliloquy.</P>
    <P>What Stone does do well is relate Nixon's early life to what he became. His father was a struggling lemon farmer, his mother a religious maniac who in the 1920s addressed her family in the language of the King James Bible, and instilled the fear of God. Nixon saw two brothers die young and clearly felt the weight of his mother's expectations for the family fall on him. Though the use of flashback becomes tiresome, and of sledgehammer-like subtlety, after a while,  we get the point that Nixon's upbringing left him with fatal flaws.</P>
    <P>Nixon's role as Senator McCarthy's hatchetman during the anti-Communist witch hunts of the post-war years, and as Eisenhower's vice-president, are only sketched in before we get to the crucial event which paved the way for Nixon's come-back in the 1960s: the Kennedy assassination.</P>
    <P>Having advanced one conspiracy theory in JFK, Stone cannot resist another. This one is that vice-president Nixon was involved in covert action against Cuba without Eisenhower's knowledge. After Kennedy became president, these continued with a momentum of their own, and a Cuban exile plot to shoot Castro turned into a plot to shoot Kennedy.</P>
    <P>How is never made clear, because the implication is that  Nixon knows this happened, but not exactly how. Even at the start of Watergate, he is uneasily sure that if investigators dig deep enough they will find something to link him to Lee Harvey Oswald.</P>
    <P>Nixon's animosity towards the Kennedys is not just that towards opponents. They represent the wealthy, liberal east coast elite whom Nixon despises. Nixon was the first Republican of modern times to detach a large chunk of the white working class from the Democrats, and the latter have not yet managed to undo this. There are limited parallels with Thatcherism.</P>
    <P>It would be easy to create a victim by depicting Nixon as either a monster or a great man traduced. Stone's film succeeds by showing both sides, and it holds more dramatic tension than one might expect for its first two hours. But by the time of Watergate, its length and repetitiousness cries out for the editing it so clearly lacks.</P>

      <H2>Underground</H2>
      <H3>(Subtitled, Dir Emir Kusturica Cert 15)</H3>
    </CENTER>
    <P>To put this into any particular genre would be  difficult -black comedy, political history even buddy movie would all be reasonable epithets. It is a story in three parts which revolves around two friends and black marketeers, Marko and Blacky . They appear at the outset as two swashbuckling Serbian heroes set against the invading Hitler regime. More than once the image of a remake of the Three Musketeers crossed my mind as the contrived set piece fights were played out.</P>
    <P>As Hitler's forces make their progress Blacky literally goes underground with friends and family into the cellars of one of Marko's relatives. There they remain for twenty years manufacturing weapons for the eventual overthrow of Hitler's army, while Marko above ground makes progress in Tito's Government and get's the girl that earlier both had craved. Blacky's eventual break out is a farcical tragicomedy as he comes across a film crew making a film of his own revolutionary past.</P>
    <P>The third section is set in modern times with Blacky leading a Serbian army troupe in war torn Yugoslavia, while Marko is an aging wheelchair bound arms dealer. The ever present theme of betrayal in a corrupt, value-free world is often lost as the comedy is played out. The twin heroes manage to survive bombings with the resilience normally only associated with cartoon characters and this makes them somewhat less sympathetic when the tragedy finally unfolds. </P>
    <P>The fantastical portrayal of the action is embellished throughout by the recurring image of a marching band bellowing out its repetitive refrains in a style best described as Balkan folk music meets Dixieland jazz. The sharp photography and the rich sounds become almost overwhelming for the viewer at times, especially as this film runs for nearly three hours. The final frames are well played however and I suspect that if one had the stamina for a repeat viewing much of the animal imagery would build in significance.</P>
    <P>This is the sort of film that just misses out on potential cult status but is worthy alternative viewing to the current Hollywood output. It gained a prize at Cannes, of course, but you cannot always rely on such awards to establish a film's worth. See it for yourself.</P>

      <H2>Mighty Aphrodite</H2>
      <H3>(Dir Woody Allen, Cert 15)</H3>
    </CENTER>
    <P>This was the Allen film that was well panned by the London critics largely because, they said, at 60 Woody Allen cannot get away with playing the romantic hero who gets the girl. Especially as the girl in this piece is in her early twenties and about six inches taller than him. Well stranger things than this happen in real life and especially to Woody himself since his affair with Mia Farrow's adopted daughter became headline news a couple of years back.</P>
    <P>It has long been the case, although not accepted by the director himself, that Woody uses the medium of film as a kind cinematic therapy to work through his own neuroses. It  was certainly the case for example with Husbands and Wives, as the Farrow break up emerged, but if there is anything here of Woody's own life it is either a confession that at his age he enjoys the fantasy of having an affair with a six foot tall blonde, or that the quest to find the real parents of adopted children may lead to some interesting surprises.</P>
    <P>Whatever the theories for his motivation for the film, Woody has certainly not excelled himself here. The story revolves around Allen's character Lenny's search for the real mother of his adopted son who seems to be unbelievably bright. It turns out that the mother is the prostitute and porn star Judy Cum.</P>
    <P>There are some lovely one liners, but perhaps not enough of them. There is a lovely cameo role from Michael Rappaport as a truly dumb boxer. And Mira Sorvino's portrayal of the happy hooker is certainly the highlight, although I question whether her performance is really worthy of the Oscar she won for best supporting actress. The Greek chorus idea is a well constructed comic distraction which completes the film with a Broadway style rendition of the Morecambe & Wise song "Give me Sunshine".</P>
    <P>But the real weakness of the film is the poor casting of Helena Bonham Carter as Woody's wife. There is simply no explanation or character building to convince the audience why these two are married. And it is this weak base from the outset which makes the contrast with the developing relationship between Allen and Sorvino even more unbelievable.</P>
    <P>So this is not Allen at his best. But it is suitable for a pleasant afternoon where all one wants is a slightly silly feel-good movie. And real fans of Woody Allen will forgive him his bizarre fantasies for portraying a middle aged sports writer who makes it with a woman at least thirty years his younger. After all this is film as therapy...isn't it?</P>

      <H2>Swimming with Sharks</H2>
      <H3>(Dir George Huang, Cert 15)</H3>
    </CENTER>
    <P>This is a gem of a film, which probably won't get the exposure it deserves. It is a spiteful portrayal of all that is bad about the Hollywood movie business. Kevin Spacey plays the part of the Senior Vice President of production at a major film studio who hires a new personal assistant played by the fresh faced and apparently principled Frank  Whaley. Spacey is still on his way to the top job and is unscrupulous in his approach.</P>
    <P>The female film producer who befriends young Whaley (Michelle Forbes) is also hawking a film project for studio support and so a question mark arises about her, and everyone else's motives. And that is most of the plot. But what we get for 90 minutes is a brilliant study in a tragicomic relationship between a tyrannical boss and long-suffering servant, and finally what happens when the worm turns.</P>
    <P>The film is related by a series of flashbacks and there is a superb twist to the finish. Kevin Spacey's masterful performance means he reaches our sympathies even after demonstrating the most complete portrayal of a manic bully seen on the screen for some time. This is definitely worth tracking down even if, ultimately, it can only be found at the video shop.</P>

<P>Sound the call for freedom boys, and sound it far and wide,<BR>March along to victory for God is on our side,<BR>While the voice of Nature thunders o'er the rising tide,<BR>&quot;God gave the land to the people!&quot;</P>
<P><I>Chorus:</I><BR>The land, the land, 'twas God who made the land,<BR>The land, the land, the ground on which we stand,<BR>Why should we be beggars with the ballot in our hand?<BR>God made the land for the people.</P>
<P>Hark the sound is spreading from the East and from the West,<BR>Why should we work hard and let the landlords take the best?<BR>Make them pay their taxes on the land just like the rest,<BR>The land was meant for the people</P>
<P><I>Chorus</I></P>
<P>Clear the way for liberty, the land must all be free,<BR>Liberals will not falter from the fight, tho' stern it be,<BR>'Til the flag we love so well will fly from sea to sea<BR>O'er the land that is free for the people</P>
<P><I>Chorus</I></P>
<P>The army now is marching on, the battle to begin.<BR>The standard now is raised on high to face the battle din,<BR>We'll never cease from fighting 'til victory we win,<BR>And the land is free for the people</P>

<P>From the workshop and the forge<BR>From the coal mine and the mill,<BR>Where the workers pay their toll of honest toil<BR>Where the women's bread is earned;<BR>From the land we love to till<BR>Comes the cry for labour's freedom of the soil</P>
<P><I>Chorus:</I><BR>Tramp, tramp, tramp upon protection,<BR>No more corn laws in the land,<BR>For the cheapness of our bread<BR>And the freedom of our food,<BR>We will make an undefeated British stand.</P>
<P>When the children cry at home<BR>For the food they need to eat,<BR>Shall we tell them we'll take the tax off tea?<BR>When the butter's all unknown<BR>And the larder's bare of meat,<BR>Shall we starve them for a farmer over sea?</P>
<P><I>Chorus</I></P>
<P>We will bless the name of Peel,<BR>For the famine that he saved,<BR>When the landlords tried to trample on the poor.<BR>When the hungry man was cursed<BR>For the drust he humbly craved.<BR>And he staggered to the open workhouse door.</P>

<H2>The Young Liberal's Lament</H2>
<P><I>(Tune: The Sailor's Lament)</I></P>
<P>I joined the Young Liberals when I was at High School,<BR>To help build a better world was my first aim.<BR>And if we should win then perhaps in the process,<BR>Into the history books would go my name.<BR></P>
<P><I>Chorus:</I><BR>So I asked the old barman to pour me another,<BR>My throat was fair bleeding for want of a wet,<BR>And the good resolutions I made to my mother,<BR>Are the good resolutions I drink to forget.</P>
<P>My branch it was small but still very active,<BR>Held sit-downs and love-ins and marches through town,<BR>But most of the people they laughed and dismissed us,<BR>And so our membership slowly went down.<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>
<P>After six months they made me their Chairman,<BR>Presiding at meetings of three or p'raps four,<BR>Yet all that this did was to fire my ambition,<BR>With one taste of power I lusted for more.<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>
<P>With only six branches and half of them derelict,<BR>The Federation meeting was easy to fix.<BR>So I took up my place on the National Executive,<BR>The rising young grass-root fresh up from the sticks.<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>
<P>So every two months I would go up to London,<BR>Move motions of censure and plot all the day.<BR>The spend all the night with the wine and the women,<BR>My youthful innocence soon thrown away.<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>
<P>And so to the National Conference at Brightpool,<BR>Where I stood for office the very first time.<BR>By plotting and bribing, seducing, conniving<BR>A Vice-Chairman's post was so easily mine.<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>
<P>Just one year later I thought I'd be Chairman,<BR>Most Federations were swinging my way.<BR>But I had forgotten the power of SEEYLF,<BR>And lost by ten votes at the end of the day.<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>
<P>Well, I've been on the booze-up for most of the evening,<BR>In twenty-five pubs or it may have been more.<BR>My head it is reeling, my feet's on the ceiling,<BR>Won't somebody show me the way to the door.<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>
<P>And so through the streets of the city I wandered,<BR>Saw two SEEYLF flash girls just passing the time.<BR>"There goes the Young Liberal who lost the election,<BR>There goes the Young Liberal cut down in his prime."<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>
<P>My friends are all grieving, I've said that I'm leaving,<BR>They'll form a procession to march me through town.<BR>And six YL virgins shall wave at the station,<BR>If six YL virgins can ever be found.<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>

<P>Within six months they'd put him up for Parliament,<BR>Gave him a seat with second place.<BR>But he went and lost it and with it his deposit,<BR>Who'll come a-losing deposits with me?<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>
<P>This same floating voter has never cast another vote,<BR>Nor does he tell the reason why,<BR>But his voice can be heard as you wander past the polling booth<BR>"Who'll come a-losing deposits with me?"<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>

<P>Well it all makes work for the activist to do.</P>
<P>A sunny Tuesday morning found the agent at the door,<BR>He said, "We're running neck and neck, we need just ten votes more,<BR>Can I rely on your support, with your help we can win."<BR>So they listened very nicely, then they punched him on the chin.</P>
<P>Well it all makes work for the activist to do.</P>
<P>T'was on the Wednesday morning that the candidate appeared,<BR>Was it too late to mitigate the massacre he feared?<BR>He said, "Can I do anything to influence your vote?"<BR>So they listened very nicely, then they grabbed him by the throat.</P>
<P>Well it all makes work for the activist to do</P>
<P>T'was on the Thursday morning when there stood David Steel.<BR>They were awestruck and they curtsied; he said, "There's no need to kneel.<BR>I realise my presence here each one of you enthrals."<BR>So the listened very nicely, then they cut off both his ****s.</P>
<P>Well it all makes work for the activist to do.</P>
<P>At 3am on Friday morn, up stepped the proud Lord Mayor.<BR>He said, "It is my privilege the voting to declare,<BR>The socialist have won the seat, the Liberal was a fake."<BR>So they took the wretched candidate and burned him at the stake.</P>
<P>Well it all makes work for the activist to do.</P>

<H2>The Soggy Song</H2>
<P><I>(Words and music: Adrian Slade)</I></P>
<P>David, Oh David,<BR>What have you done?<BR>Playing at Liberals<BR>Was once such fun.<BR>I've been fighting for PR<BR>Since I was a boy.<BR>But I don't want to share it<BR>With Shirley and Roy.</P>
<P><I>Chorus:</I><BR>Social Democracy!<BR>What the hell is it meant to be?<BR>I don't want to live with the soggy dems.<BR>I just want to live on my own.</P>
<P>I love resolutions<BR>And meetings and things.<BR>I've always got jumble<BR>If somebody rings.<BR>I love being a candidate<BR>Just when I choose<BR>But it won't be much fun<BR>If we're not going to lose.<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>
<P>That Owen! He's arrogant,<BR>Thinks he is it.<BR>That Shirley! She wanted<BR>To push out Bill Pitt.<BR>That Rodgers can take<BR>His hands off us because<BR>It was us who told Jenkins<BR>Where Warrington was.<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>
<P>They could have been Liberals;<BR>They could have stayed put;<BR>They could have backed Healey;<BR>They could fought Foot;<BR>They could have had<BR>One new idea in their head,<BR>But decided to pinch all<BR>The Liberals' instead.<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>
<P>North Devon, Torrington,<BR>Ross and Caithness,<BR>Cheadle, North Cornwall,<BR>And Bessel's success;<BR>Orpington, Ripon and Sutton -<BR>You choose 'em<BR>Libs know how to win them<BR>And know how to lose 'em!<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>
<P>We've won seats on councils,<BR>We've taken the brunt.<BR>We don't mind them behind us,<BR>But not out in front<BR>We don't need a partner,<BR>We don't want a rival.<BR>We just want to have<BR>A new Liberal revival.<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>
<P>Stuff 'em being famous,<BR>Stuff 'em being new<BR>Stuff 'e, being radical<BR>Like me and you.<BR>Stuff their campaigning,<BR>It's nowt but a farce,<BR>They should stuff a few Focuses<BR>Right up their ...<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>

<HR><A NAME="s2"></A>
<H2>Bermondsey</H2>
<P><I>(Words: Simon Banks, Tune: Marching Thro' Georgia)</I></P>
<P>Bring the good old Focus-freaks, we'll do another street;<BR>Focus till we're goggle-eyed and steam comes from our feet;<BR>Get the problems sorted out while Labour only bleat,<BR>When we are marching through Bermondsey.</P>
<P><I>Chorus:</I><BR>Hurrah! Hurrah! We'll get you off the rocks!<BR>Hurrah! Hurrah! We're working off our ... socks!<BR>So we sang this chorus from Elephant to the Docks<BR>When we were marching through Bermondsey.</P>
<P>Tatchell hit the headlines, boys, but Simon hit the trail;<BR>Labour put their Foot in it, and Focus could not fail;<BR>Liberals came from far and wide, for Simon and good ale,<BR>When we were marching through Bermondsey.<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>
<P>There were lads from Leyton, boys, and lasses up from Kent;<BR>Hertfordshire and Dorset came, and Croydon too, and Brent;<BR>SDP were also there, and sure it was well meant,<BR>When we were marching through Bermondsey.<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>
<P>When we made the joyful sound, it lifted up the lifts;<BR>Filled the empty flats again, and healed the pavement rifts;<BR>There were Liberal votes in hoards, but none of them were gifts<BR>When we were marching through Bermondsey.<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>
<P>Tatchell went, and Tilley came and said that he was straight;<BR>English, not Australian; no cobber, but a mate;<BR>But the folk read Focus and thought Simon Hughes was great<BR>When we were marching through Bermondsey.<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>

<H2>Staircase</H2>
<P><I>(Words: Mark Taverner, Tune: Climb Every Mountain)</I></P>
<P>Climb every staircase,<BR>Don't spare your feet,<BR>Scour every tower block<BR>Till you win your seat.</P>
<P>Climb every staircase,<BR>Try every door,<BR>Canvass every voter,<BR>Till you find one more.</P>
<P>One vote that may mean<BR>That you candidate's in,<BR>That may turn a defeat<BR>To a glorious win.</P>
<P>Climb every staircase<BR>Try every door<BR>Canvass every voter,<BR>Till you find one more.</P>

<HR><A NAME="s4"></A>
<H2>Shirl in the World</H2>
<P><I>(Tune: If you were the Only Girl in the World)</I></P>
<P>If you were the only Shirl in the world<BR>And I were the only Woy,<BR>Nothing else would matter in the world today,<BR>We could go on loving in the same old way.<BR>If David and Bill fall i with my plans<BR>And the members don't get a say,<BR>I will find such wonderful things to do;<BR>I'll even find a second-rate job for you.<BR>If you were the only Shirl in the world<BR>And I were the only Woy.</P>
<P>If you were the only Shirl in the world<BR>And I were the only Woy,<BR>Think of all the Democwats we would bweed,<BR>We'd get all the votes that we would ever need.<BR>A blancmange of centrists, Liberals too,<BR>Some working-class lads for show.<BR>You'd be President, I'd be in control;<BR>You'd be my lieutenant, a very agweeable wole.<BR>If you were the only Shirl in the world<BR>And I were the only Woy.</P>
<P>If you were the only Shirl in the world<BR>And I were the only Woy,<BR>We could be so happy and so civilised<BR>Once we'd shed those pwoletawian Labour ties.<BR>We'd stock up with clawet, a good line in hock;<BR>We'd leave all the plebs the beer.<BR>I would be so wonderfully good to you.<BR>You would be so wonderfully good for me.<BR>For you are the only Shirl in the world<BR>And I am the only Woy</P>

<H2>Hymn 666</H2>
<P><I>(Words: Mark Taverner, Tune: Eternal Father)</I></P>
<P>Eternal David, for the fight<BR>With others thou bidd'st us unite.<BR>With prophets odd, with doctrine strange<BR>For these we must our seats exchange.<BR>O hear us when we cry to thee;<BR>Why must we love the SDP?</P>
<P>Thou tied us to the Gang of Four.<BR>We shall pure Liberals be no more.<BR>What help or gain dost thou believe<BR>From this surrender, we receive?<BR>O Hear us when we cry to thee:<BR>Why must we love the SDP?</P>
<P>Accept our prayer in spirit meant,<BR>We do not question thine intent.<BR>We share with thee the will to win,<BR>The Tories out and Liberals in.<BR>Eternal David, just for thee,<BR>We'll try to love the SDP.</P>

<P><I>(La Marseillaise)</I></P>
<P>A bon amis de l' Essdipie,<BR>Vos coeurs et Roi sont fiances:<BR>Contre nos magnifiques parties,<BR>C'est La Femme de Fer, ou Pied,<BR>C'est La Femme de Fer, ou Pied!<BR>Rencontrez-nous pour les campagnes<BR>Bouger ces fossiles vers le bas<BR>C'est rien a les vaincre, n'est-ce pas?<BR>Donc buvons nos verres de champagne<BR>A guerre, Penhaligons! Gagnez les Warringtons!<BR>Gar&ccedil;on! Gar&ccedil;on!<BR>Deux vins encore, m'sieur, pour nos chansons!</P>

<H2>Over the Sea to Skye</H2>
<P><I>(Words: Stuart Callison)</I></P>
<P>Speed bonnie boat,<BR>Like a hack on the make;<BR>Back to his seat on Skye.<BR>Carry the lad that was born to be King,<BR>Back to the seat on Skye<BR>Where is the man?<BR>Down in the bar,<BR>Loudly the Whips pro-clai-aim<BR>Out on the town,<BR>Out of his head,<BR>Charlie is pissed again.</P>

<HR><A NAME="s8"></A>
<H2>The Policies They are A-changin'</H2>
<P><I>(Words: Simon Titley, Tune: The Times They Are A-changin'</I></P>
<P>Come gather round Liberals wherever you roam<BR>And admit that your Leader to fudgin' is prone.<BR>And accept that now all his principles are flown<BR>'Cos it's real power for which he is aimin'.<BR>So you'd better sell out and become a Steel-clone.<BR>Oh the policies they are a-changin'</P>
<P>Come radicals, Grassroots and end your defiance.<BR>We'll drop our old line and we'll form an Alliance<BR>With the Gang of Four mould-breaking soggy Dem giants<BR>Who expect us to do all their slavin'.<BR>And if that doesn't work then they'll blind us with science.<BR>Oh the policies they are a-changin'</P>
<P>Come policy experts who speak with forked tongue;<BR>You're needed to form a new Joint Commission.<BR>With a judge, and MP, Richard Holme and a don<BR>And a peer that is rapidly agein':<BR>The report you'll churn out will be just a big con.<BR>Oh the policies they are a-changin'</P>
<P>Come bores and fanatics, who to Europe do cling;<BR>And admit all you want are the free foreign flings.<BR>So we'll join E.L.D even though it's right-wing<BR>With a programme that's positively shamin'.<BR>No wonder our Party gets an adverse swing<BR>Oh the policies they are a-changin'.</P>
<P>Don't ask me the line on free trade or on cruise;<BR>On council house sales, acid rain or the Druze.<BR>Don't ask about rate-capping or sniffing glues<BR>'Cos the radical line's beyond savin'.<BR>The tough and the tender? I'll just drown in booze.<BR>Oh the policies they are a-changin'.</P>

<HR><A NAME="s9"></A>
<H2>Ode to Chegwyn</H2>
<P><I>Tune: St. Peter</I></P>
<P>How sweet the name of Chegwyn sounds<BR>In a candidate's ear.<BR>It calms all panics, clears all frowns,<BR>And drives away all fear.</P>
<P>It flummoxes the MORI poll<BR>And upsets all the rest.<BR>Vince Hanna says we're near the goal<BR>And Labour does the rest.</P>
<P>O Name that angers labour more<BR>Than Tories ever could.<BR>Socialists over leaflets pour<BR>And wish theirs were as good.</P>
<P>Weak is the feeling in my legs<BR>From pushing things through doors;<BR>But when I get back to HQ - <BR>He'll send me out once more.</P>
<P>Till then I would sing of campaigns<BR>In towns both near and far,<BR>And others who would do the same<BR>Can join me in the bar.</P>

<HR><A NAME="s10"></A>
<H2>Greenhill</H2>
<P><I>(Words: Ralph Bancroft and Caroline Morgan, Tune: Tip-toe Through the Tulips)</I></P>
<P>Tip-toe through the Tories<BR>With a Focus and a window bill.<BR>Come tip-toe through the Tories with me.<BR>Tip-toe through the Tories<BR>With a poster and a canvass card.<BR>Come tip-toe through the Tories with me.</P>
<P>Knee-deep in Tories we'll stride<BR>We'll smash their vote open wide.<BR>And if I kick one in the goolies<BR>And they arrest me<BR>Will you bail me out?<BR>Come tip-toe through the Tories with me.</P>

<HR><A NAME="s11"></A>
<H2>The Liberal Leader</H2>
<P><I>(Words: Mark Taverner, Tune: The Ugly Duckling)</I></P>
<P>There once was a Liberal leader<BR>With feathers all fluffy and brown;<BR>And the other Libs said to his nibs:<BR>Quack, quack! Get out of town.<BR>Quack, quack! Get out. Quack, quack! Get out.<BR>Quack, quack! Get out of town.</P>
<P>All through Assembly time he hid himself away,<BR>Ashamed to show his face, afraid of what others might say.<BR>All through Assembly left moping with his greed<BR>When a bunch of sogs espied him there and very soon agreed:<BR>You're a very fine sog indeed!</P>
<P><I>Spoken</I><BR>And he said, "Me? A sog?"<BR>"Take a look at yourself in the lake"<BR>And he saw and he said, "I am a sog! Wheee..."</P>
<P>"I'm not such a Liberal leader<BR>With principles solid and sound."<BR>And the other sogs went the whole hog<BR>And said, "the best in town.<BR>Quack, quack! the best. Quack, quack! the best,<BR>Quack, quack! The best in town."</P>
<P>Not a Greaves, not a Greaves, not a Smithson, nor a Greaves:<BR>But a Bill and a Shirley and an Owen if you please;<BR>And a Roy so noble and high.<BR>"Say who's a Liberal leader? Not I!"</P>

<HR><A NAME="s12"></A>
<H2>The Pallid Pink Flag</H2>
<P><I>(Tune: Tannenbaum)</I></P>
<P>The party's flag is pallid pink<BR>And old Madeira is our drink,<BR>Though Labour sneers and Tories plot,<BR>We will remain a moderate lot.<BR>Then raise our banner shoulder-height,<BR>For to do more is impolite,<BR>We are so middle-of-the-road,<BR>Our guiding light's the Highway Code.</P>

<A NAME="s13"></A>
<H2>Our Party's One Foundation</H2>
<P><I>(Tune: Our Church's one foundation)</I></P>
<P>Our party's one foundation<BR>Is Dai, Shirl, Bill and Roy.<BR>We'll back up Conservation<BR>Or any other ploy.<BR>We have no manifesto,<BR>No policies have we,<BR>But vote us in - Hey Presto!<BR>You'll see what you will see.</P>

<P>'Cos I was afraid to merge in Blackpool back that Jan.,<BR>Paddy took me to one side and told me: &quot;Be a man.&quot;<BR>He said, &quot;You may not like the name or ref'rence to NATO,<BR>The constitution you can change when t'Conference next you go.&quot;</P>
<P><I>Chorus</I></P>
<P>I travelled back to Blackpool then, that September week.<BR>Constitution to amend, that's all I did seek.<BR>But all debate must be suppressed, in case it rocks the boat -<BR>So scrub it from the agenda, don't put it to the vote.</P>
<P><I>Chorus</I></P>
<P>So if your party's been hijacked by bunker app'ratchics,<BR>Committees that you cannot trust and other dirty tricks,<BR>You'd better start planning how you're going to win it back.<BR>We'll start by closing Cowley Street and giving Dee the sack!</P>

<P>In Glasgow's fair city,<BR>Where the boys are so pretty,<BR>I first set my eyes on sweet Charles Kennedy;<BR>As he hawked his ambition<BR>From meeting to meeting:<BR>"I'm a bonnie wee laddie<BR>From the new SDP,<BR>I'm a bonnie wee laddie.<BR>I'm a bonnie wee laddie.<BR>I'm a bonnie wee laddie<BR>From the new SDP."</P>

<P>A Leader was leading his party one night,<BR>A ragbag collection: a pitiful sight.<BR>Its principles bare; its policies thin,<BR>'T'was nought but a skeleton covered with skin.<BR>So Ashdown turned round<BR>And cried "Woe and alack!"<BR>He was only a moment,<BR>But when he turned back,<BR>His party had gone and in anguish, he cried,<BR>"Oh, where has my party gone?" The voters replied:</P>
<P>"Oh your party has gone down the plughole.<BR>Your party is gone, every bit.<BR>It has been rather low for a year or so,<BR>And now it's face-first in the s***.<BR>Your Party is totally knackered,<BR>Your leadership's right down the drain.<BR>Still no need to feel blue,<BR>There's just one thing to do:<BR>Bring back the Liberals again."</P>

<P>And no-one wants to buy them,<BR>And no-one wants to read them;<BR>So they're all put in the basement,<BR>And they all end up just the same.</P>
<P>And the dustmen come to Cowley Street,<BR>And collect the green papers,<BR>And they all get put in dustcarts,<BR>Little dustcarts just the same.</P>
<P>They're on housing and on transport,<BR>And there's one on prostitution,<BR>And they're all a bit wishy-washy,<BR>And they all look just the same.</P>

<H2>Letterboxes</H2>
<P><I>(Words: Chris Young, Tune: Little Boxes)</I></P>
<P>Letterboxes on the doorfronts,<BR>Letterboxes going snippy-snappy;<BR>Letterboxes on the doorfronts -<BR>Letterboxes hurt and maim.<BR>There's a high one and a low one,<BR>And a small one and a narrow one;<BR>And they all stick or go snipy-snappy,<BR>And they all hurt just the same.</P>
<P>And the Focus for the houses<BR>Was written by the candidate;<BR>But he won't touch letterboxes:<BR>Letterboxes hurts and maim.<BR>So I take them and I fold then,<BR>And I try to deliver them;<BR>But they all scrape or go snippy-snappy,<BR>And they all hurt just the same.</P>
<P>Now the front flap on the letterbox<BR>Is stiff or goes flippy-flappy<BR>And it bruises all my fingers<BR>And it traps them in the frame -<BR>Which is filled with rows of bristles<BR>Which crumple the leaflet up.<BR>And they all jam or go scritchy-scratchy,<BR>And they all hurt just the same.</P>
<P>As I bleed upon the leaflet,<BR>It stops at the inner flap,<BR>And I have to wedge it open<BR>With my fingers in the frame.<BR>Then a dog jumps at the doorfront<BR>And tries to bite my fingers off.<BR>And they all growl or go yippy-yappy,<BR>And they all hurt just the same.</P>
<P>So the leaflet turns to dogfood<BR>Or gets snagged in silly curtaining,<BR>And get tangled, further mangled:<BR>It is all part of the game.<BR>When the owner gets the leaflet,<BR>It must be half-illegible;<BR>And they'll never vote Libby-Labby.<BR>But it all hurts just the same.</P>
<P>Letterboxes on the doorfronts<BR>Should be subject to regulations;<BR>Never sideways, all at waist height,<BR>Letterboxes just the same.<BR>And the dogs should be sedated,<BR>And the hinges lubricated fully.<BR>They'd be simple and not knicky-knacky,<BR>And they'd all work just the same.</P>

<P>Alright said Beith, home affairs is better;<BR>Family values is what I will suggest.<BR>But video nasties<BR>Featuring pederasty<BR>Landed on top of his desk,<BR>So Paddy and me had another cup of tea<BR>And then we went home.</P>

<H2>The Week we went to Brighton</H2>
<P><I>(Words: Adrian Slade, Tune: Bangor)</I></P>
<P>Didn't we have a lovely time<BR>The week we went to Brighton -<BR>Voting for policy options that<BR>Upset the Parliamentary Party.<BR>Wasn't it fun seeing Alex Carlisle<BR>Standing at the rostrum,<BR>Venting his rage<BR>On the minimum wage<BR>To no avail.</P>
<P>Didn't we have a lovely time<BR>Debating equidistance,<BR>All being surprised at the Guardian do<BR>When Ming and Russel favoured Labour.<BR>Set in a whirl by Bill Roy and Shirl,<BR>Who think the mould is broken,<BR>We stood on our head<BR>Not to jump into bed<BR>With Tony Blair.</P>
<P>Didn't we have a lovely time<BR>Electing Bob Maclennan,<BR>Saying good-bye to Charlie Boy,<BR>And not electing Martin Thomas;<BR>Or giving much to poor young Don,<BR>Who'd collected all those names up -<BR>Maybe because<BR>He was lively and new<BR>And we can't risk that.</P>
<P>Didn't we have a lovely time<BR>Discussing all out tax plans;<BR>Changing our mind on 60 per cent<BR>And probably changing them back again.<BR>Because they let loose poor Malcolm Bruce<BR>To give us a presentation.<BR>Creating a budget in quarter'f'an'hour<BR>Is a brave thing to do.</P>
<P>Didn't we have a lovely time<BR>Upsetting Paddy Ashdown:<BR>Making him hot at the thought of pot<BR>Available at sweetie counters.<BR>"No, not at all," he was able to call,<BR>"We'll have a Royal Commission."<BR>So wasn't he lucky<BR>We didn't go on<BR>To abolish the Queen!</P>

<H2>Plonkers on the Right</H2>
<P><I>(Words: Mark Taverner, Tune Strangers in the Night)</I></P>
<P>Plonkers on the Right<BR>All Dicks and Boyson,<BR>Festering in the night<BR>A foetid poison,<BR>Free to run its course<BR>The 1980s through.</P>
<P>Nothing was too strong,<BR>Or would deter them.<BR>Nothing we did wrong<BR>Seemed to bestir them.<BR>Dreams we've had so long<BR>Felt like might come true.</P>
<P>Plonkers on the Right,<BR>Mad Tory people,<BR>We were plonkers on the Right<BR>Up to that moment on that<BR>Night in '92.<BR>Bound to lose, we knew,<BR>But when it came to judgement day<BR>They voted for us anyway;</P>
<P>And . . .</P>
<P>Now it seems that night<BR>Will be our ruin,<BR>The voters knew all right,<BR>What they were doin'.<BR>A lasting end's in sight<BR>For plonkers on the right.</P>

<H2>Pacts, Pacts, Glorious Pacts</H2>
<P><I>(Words: Janice Turner, Tune: Mud, Mud, Glorious Mud)</I></P>
<P>A bold Liberal Democrat was drinking one day,<BR>With his thoughts on elections afar.<BR>Then a bottle of Bollinger he sent with great speed<BR>To the socialist clique at the bar.<BR>He said, "You've been buggered since '79,<BR>And my party's still stuck at square one.<BR>You can't lose again for that's five in a row<BR>And I will be out on my bum."</P>
<P>Pact, pact, give him a pact,<BR>He says it's the way to get Major the sack.<BR>"I'm not being sinister, now don't be a ninny, sir,<BR>You can make me Prime Minister<BR>With a glorious pact."</P>
<P>Now Labour was rudderless 'cos Kinnock had gone,<BR>Smith and Beckett didn't know what to do.<BR>They said, "Darling Paddy, we can't say yes out loud"<BR>So they whispered "Perhaps" in the loo.<BR>The Labour dilemma was easy to see,<BR>It was heresy to say they might lose.<BR>But maybe with Paddy they could go further right<BR>And drink better quality booze.</P>
<P>Pact, pact, give 'em a pact,<BR>It's the last chance they've got to give Major the sack<BR>We'll do it quite deftly, so don't be too hefty,<BR>We'll make Paddy a leftie,<BR>With a glorious pact.</P>
<P>Paddy turned to the Liberals, saying: "It sure is the thing,<BR>An alliance is just what we need.<BR>I'm fed up of yomping to third place again,<BR>If you can't beat 'em join and succeed."<BR>Big Cyril went purple, the earth shook with rage,<BR>The right of the party went blue.<BR>Destruction of Labour was their lifelong aim,<BR>But Paddy went pink and said, "Poo".</P>
<P>Pact, pact, give him a pact<BR>It's a last ditch attempt to get Major the sack.<BR>So follow him follow, your pride you must swallow,<BR>And there let us wallow<BR>With a glorious pact.</P>

<H2>The Red Flag</H2>
<P><I>(Words: Jim Connell, Tune: Tannenbaum)</I></P>
<P>The people's flag is deepest red,<BR>It shrouded oft our martyred dead.<BR>And ere their limbs lie stiff and cold,<BR>Their hearts' blood dyed to every fold.</P>
<P><I>Chorus:</I><BR>Then raise the scarlet standard high;<BR>Beneath its folds we'll live and die.<BR>Though cowards flinch and traitors sneer,<BR>We'll keep the red flag flying here.</P>
<P>Look round, the Frenchman loves its blaze;<BR>The sturdy German chants its praise;<BR>In Moscow's vaults its hymns are sung;<BR>Chicago swells the surging throng.<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>
<P>It waved above our infant might<BR>When all ahead seemed dark as night;<BR>It witnessed many a deed and vow,<BR>We must not change its colour now.<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>
<P>It well recalls the triumphs past;<BR>It gives the hope of peace at last:<BR>The banner bright, the symbol plain,<BR>Of human right and human gain.<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>
<P>It suits today the meek and base,<BR>Whose minds are fixed in self and place.<BR>To cringe beneath the rich man's frown,<BR>And haul that sacred emblem down.<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>
<P>With heads uncovered swear we all<BR>To bare onward till we fall.<BR>Come dungeons dark of gallows grim,<BR>This song shall be our parting hymn<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>

<H2>We Shall Overcome</H2>
<P>We shall overcome.<BR>We shall overcome<BR>We shall overcome some day;<BR>Oh, deep in my heart,<BR>I do believe,<BR>We shall overcome some day.</P>
<P>We shall live in peace . . .</P>
<P>Black and white together . . .</P>
<P>We shall not be moved . . .</P>
<P>We shall ban the bomb . . .</P>
<P>We shall walk hand in hand . . .</P>

<H2>The Pink Flag</H2>
<P><I>(Tune: Tannenbaum)</I></P>
<P>The people's flag is slightly pink,<BR>It's not as red as most folks think.<BR>We must not let the people know<BR>What socialists thought long ago.</P>
<P><I>Chorus:</I><BR>Don't let the scarlet banner float.<BR>We want the middle classes vote.<BR>Let our old-fashioned comrades sneer,<BR>We'll stay in power for many a year.</P>
<P>Some years ago the flag was red;<BR>No-one knew then what was ahead.<BR>It witnessed many a deed and vow -<BR>We cannot use that colour now.<BR><I>Chorus</I></P>
<P>It well recalled the triumphs past,<BR>It gave the hope of peace at last<BR>But once in government it's plain<BR>The red flag none shall see again.<BR><I>Chorus</I></P>
<P>With heads uncovered once we swore<BR>Always to bear it on before.<BR>With power now our first concern<BR>We have to let the red flag burn.<BR><I>Chorus</I></P>

<H2>Oh My Stalin</H2>
<P><I>(Tune: Clementine)</I></P>
<P>In the Kremlin, in the Kremlin,<BR>In the Spring of '39,<BR>Sat a Russian and a Prussian,<BR>Working on the Party line.</P>
<P><I>Chorus:</I><BR>Oh my Stalin, Oh my Stalin,<BR>Oh my Stalin Party line.<BR>First he changed it, then rearranged it<BR>Oh my Stalin Party line.</P>
<P>Leon Trotsky was a Nazi,<BR>And I knew it for a fact.<BR>First I read it, then I said it,<BR>'Till the Hitler-Soviet Pact.<BR><I>Chorus</I></P>
<P>In Siberia, in Siberia,<BR>Excavating a salt mine,<BR>Dwelt an old Bolshevik,<BR>Who forgot the Party line.<BR><I>Chorus</I></P>
<P><I>Change tune to Auld Lang Syne</I></P>
<P>Should auld Bolshies be forgot<BR>And never brought to mind,<BR>Should auld Bolshies be forgot<BR>For the sake of the Party line.<BR>The Party line, the Party line,<BR>The line, comrades, the line.<BR>Joe Stalin shot the bloody lot<BR>For the sake of the Party line.</P>

<H2>Battle Hymn of the New Labour Party</H2>
<P><I>(Tune: Tannebaum)</I></P>
<P><I>Standard Version</I></P>
<P>The cloth cap and the working class<BR>As images are dated.<BR>Now that Labour's gone avant-garde<BR>Is highly educated<BR>By tax adjustments, they have planned<BR>To institute the promised land.<BR>And just show that they're still sincere,<BR>We sing the Red Flag once a year.</P>
<P>Firm principles and policies<BR>Are open to objections,<BR>And a streamlined party image is<BR>The way to win elections.<BR>So raise the neat umbrellas high,<BR>The mobile phone and college tie.<BR>We stand united, raise a cheer<BR>And sing the Red Flag once a year.</P>
<P>It's one step forward, one step back,<BR>Our dance is devilish daring<BR>A leftward shuffle, a rightward tack,<BR>The pause to take a bearing.<BR>We'll change the country bit by bit<BR>So nobody will notice it.<BR>Then ever after never fear<BR>We'll sing the Red Flag once a year.</P>
<P>We will not cease from mental fight<BR>Till every wrong is righted,<BR>And all men are equal, quite,<BR>And all our leaders knighted.<BR>For we are sure if we persist<BR>To make the New Year's honours list<BR>Then every loyal Labour peer<BR>Will sing the Red Flag once a year.</P>
<P>So vote for us and not for then,<BR>We're just as true to NATO.<BR>We'll be calm and British when<BR>We steer the ship of state - o.<BR>We'll stand as firm as them<BR>To show we're patriotic gentlemen,<BR>Though man to man shall brothers be -<BR>Deterrence is our policy.</P>
<P>So raise the mushroom clouds on high,<BR>Within their shade we'll live and die.<BR>Though cowards flinch and traitors sneer,<BR>We'll sing the Red Flag once a year.</P>
<P><EM>1995 Version</EM></P>
<P></P>
<P>The cloth cap and the working class<BR>As images are dated.<BR>In Mandleson and Blair's regime<BR>All lefties are frustrated.<BR>By snappy soundbites, they have planned<BR>To institute the promised land.<BR>And just show that they're still sincere,<BR>They sing the Red Flag once a year.</P>
<P>Firm principles and policies<BR>Are open to objections,<BR>And a streamlined party image is<BR>The way to win elections.<BR>So raise the avocados high,<BR>The mobile phone and Fettes tie.<BR>They stand united, raise a cheer<BR>And sing the Red Flag once a year.</P>
<P>It's one step forward, two steps back,<BR>Their dance is not so daring<BR>A rightwards shuffle, the poor attacked,<BR>A pause to take a bearing.<BR>They'll change the country bit by bit<BR>So nobody will notice it.<BR>Then ever after never fear<BR>They'll sing the Red Flag once a year.</P>
<P>No matter how far Tories go<BR>New Labour's there before they know.<BR>Jack Straw may be a piece of s**te<BR>But he's right-wing, so he's all right;<BR>And when he makes a hash of it,<BR>Claire Short provides some real 'good shit'.<BR>Illiberal they may appear -<BR>The Red Flag floats high once a year.</P>
<P>They will not cease from mental fight<BR>Till every wrong is righted,<BR>And all men are equal, quite,<BR>And all their leaders knighted.<BR>For they are sure, if they persist<BR>To make the New Year's honours list<BR>Then every loyal Labour peer<BR>Will sing the Red Flag once a year.</P>
<P>The colour red has had to go<BR>In place of pale pistachio -<BR>They dance to every tabloid's tune<BR>And red flags just fly over tombs.</P>

<H2>Harry was a Bolshie</H2>
<P>Harry was a Bolshie,<BR>One of Stalin's lads,<BR>Till he was foully murdered<BR>By reactionary cads.</P>
<P>Said Harry, "Very well,<BR>I'm not afraid to die.<BR>I'll carry on the Party's work<BR>In the land beyond the sky."</P>
<P>So he came up to Heaven<BR>Saw St. Peter with the keys -<BR>"Oh can I speak to Comrade God,<BR>I'm Harry Pollitt, please?"</P>
<P>Said St. Peter to our Harry,<BR>"Are you humble and contrite?"<BR>"I'm a friend of Lady Docker."<BR>"Oh well, that will be alright."</P>
<P>So they took him into Heaven,<BR>Put a harp into his hand;<BR>But he played the Internationale<BR>In Hallelujah Band.</P>
<P>The conditions up in Heaven<BR>Our Harry didn't like.<BR>So he organised the angels<BR>And he brought them out on strike.</P>
<P>God walking in his garden<BR>One evening rather like -<BR>Who should he see but Harry<BR>Chalking slogans on the gate?</P>
<P>So they brought him up for trial<BR>Before the Holy Ghost,<BR>For spreading disaffection<BR>Among the Heavenly host.</P>
<P>The verdict it was 'guilty'.<BR>Said Harry, "Very well."<BR>He tucked his nightie round his knees<BR>And he floated down to Hell.</P>
<P>Well 7 long years have passed,<BR>And Harry's doing well;<BR>He's been made People's Commissar<BR>Of the Soviet Socialist Hell.</P>
<P>Now 7 more years have passed;<BR>John Gollan's there as well,<BR>And all the devils<BR>Have joined the YCL.</P>

<H2>The Internationale</H2>
<P>Arise! Ye starvelings from your slumbers;<BR>Arise! Ye prisoners of want.<BR>For Reason in revolt new thunders,<BR>And at last ends the age of cant.<BR>Now away with all your superstitions,<BR>Servile masses arise! Arise!<BR>We'll change forthwith the old conditions,<BR>And spurn the dust to win the prize.</P>
<P><I>Chorus:</I><BR>Then comrades come rally,<BR>And the last fight let us face.<BR>The Internationale<BR>Unites the human race<BR>Then comrades come rally,<BR>And the last fight let us face.<BR>The Internationale<BR>Unites the human race</P>
<P>We peasants, artisans and others;<BR>Enrolled among the sons of toil.<BR>Let's claim the earth henceforth for brothers;<BR>Drive the indolent from the soil.<BR>On our flesh too long has fed the raven;<BR>We've too long been the vulture's prey.<BR>But now, farewell the spirit craven,<BR>The dawn brings in a brighter day.<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>
<P>No saviour from high delivers;<BR>No trust have we in prince or peer.<BR>Our own right hand the chains must shiver,<BR>Chains of hatred, of greed and fear.<BR>'Ere the thieves will out with their booty<BR>And to all give a happier lot.<BR>Each at his forge must do his duty<BR>And strike the iron while it's hot.<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>

<H2>Solidarity Forever</H2>
<P><I>(Tune: John Brown's Body)</I></P>
<P>When the Union's inspiration through the workers' blood shall run,<BR>There can be no power greater anywhere beneath the Sun.<BR>Yet what force on earth is weaker that the feeble strength of one?<BR>But the Union makes us strong.</P>
<P><I>Chorus:</I><BR>Solidarity forever,<BR>Solidarity forever,<BR>Solidarity forever,<BR>For the Union makes us strong.</P>
<P>Is there aught we hold in common with the greedy parasite,<BR>Who would lash us into serfdom and would crush us with his might?<BR>Is there anything left to us but to organise and fight<BR>For the Union makes us strong.<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>
<P>It is we who ploughed the prairies, built the cities where they trade;<BR>Dug the mines and built the workshops; endless miles of railroad laid.<BR>Now we stand outcast and starving, 'midst the wonders we have made;<BR>But the Union makes us strong.<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>
<P>All the world that's owned by idle drones is ours and ours alone.<BR>We have laid the wide foundations; built it skyward stone by stone.<BR>It is ours, not to slave in, but to master and to own,<BR>While the Union makes us strong<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>
<P>They have taken untold millions that they never toiled to earn,<BR>But without our brain and muscle not a single wheel can turn.<BR>We can break their haughty power, gain our freedom when we learn<BR>That the Union makes us strong<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>
<P>In our hands is placed a power greater than their hoarded gold;<BR>Greater than the might of armies, magnified a thousand-fold.<BR>We can break their haughty power, gain our freedom when we learn<BR>That the Union makes us strong.<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>

<P><I>Chorus:</I><BR>Men and women, stand together,<BR>Do not heed the men of war.<BR>Make your minds up now or never,<BR>Ban the bomb for ever more.</P>
<P>Tell the leaders of all nations,<BR>Make the whole wide world take heed,<BR>Poison from the radiations<BR>Strikes at every race and creed.<BR>Must you put mankind in danger,<BR>Murder folk in distant lands?<BR>Would you bring death to a stranger,<BR>Have their blood upon your hands?<BR><EM>Chorus:</EM></P>
<P>Shall we lay the world in ruin?<BR>Only you can make the choice;<BR>Stop and think of what you're doing,<BR>Join the march and raise your voice.<BR>Time is short, we must be speedy,<BR>We can see the hungry filled,<BR>House the homeless, help the needy.<BR>Shall we blast or shall we build?<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>

<H2>Chevaline</H2>
<P><I>(Tune: Clementine)</I></P>
<P>Once a cabal deep in Whitehall<BR>Hid from Parliament and Queen;<BR>And decided to provide it -<BR>Deadly secret Chevaline.</P>
<P><I>Chorus:</I><BR>First the Tories, later Labour<BR>Bought and sold us all serene.<BR>But we won't trust any more such,<BR>And we won't have Chevaline.</P>
<P>For deployment and employment<BR>Of its genocidal team,<BR>Aldermaston set its heart on<BR>Salaries from Chevaline<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>
<P>NATO stooges in high places<BR>Picked the bones of Britain clean,<BR>Stole a thousand times a million,<BR>Spent it all on Chevaline.<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>
<P>Ruined towns and rotting cities<BR>Crumble into smithereens,<BR>But the cities are all British,<BR>And the weapon -Chevaline!<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>
<P>Who can quarrel with the moral<BR>Of a story so obscene:<BR>If we mean to live in freedom,<BR>We must cancel Chevaline!<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>

<HR><A NAME="s3"></A>
<H2>O Little Town of Newbury</H2>
<P><I>(Tune: O Little Town of Bethlehem)</I></P>
<P>O Little town of Newbury, how still your ruins lie.<BR>Above your deep and dreanless sleep the satellites go by,<BR>But from your hilltops long have flown the megadeaths of hate;<BR>The lies and fears of all the years, which brought you to this fate.</P>
<P>How silently, how silently, your radiant ashes glow.<BR>The fires of hell, the filthy smell, were long ago.<BR>But in your rubble still we read your message of despair,<BR>"If we must die, let others die in millions Over There!"</P>
<P>The tragedy is that you never really had to burn.<BR>Both far too late and far too great you paid the price to learn;<BR>If we want life, let other live and let the world be shared;<BR>Let rulers go, and nations no more threaten or be feared.</P>
<P>For little towns like Newbury might sleep today unharmed<BR>If they had seen that missiles mean the world must be disarmed.<BR>And poverty and ignorance and private wealth must cease,<BR>If there's to be a world that's free, a planet that's at peace.</P>

<HR><A NAME="s4"></A>
<H2>Star-Spangled Missile</H2>
<P><I>(Words: David Senior, Tune: Star-Spangled Banner)</I></P>
<P>Oh say can you see, by the night's eerie glow,<BR>Where once proudly we camped on the roadside's green verges.<BR>While broad streets and bright homes in the valley below<BR>Are burnt on the altar of NATO's mad urges.<BR>	And the rocket's red glare, mushroom clouds in the air,<BR>	Gave proof to the world that the base had been there.<BR>Oh say must that star-spangled missile yet cruise,<BR>O'er this land of the free, who that fate would refuse.</P>

<HR><A NAME="s5"></A>
<H2>Trident, Trident</H2>
<P><I>(Tune: Daisy, Daisy)</I></P>
<P>Trident, Trident - what an insane idea!<BR>Thousands homeless, all for the want of fear.<BR>We can't afford medication, or proper education,<BR>But we must pay a million a day,<BR>So that Britain can disappear!</P>
<P>Trident, Trident - give us a break, please do.<BR>We'd go bankrupt, all for the price of you;<BR>We'd lose even more employment, and most of life's enjoyment.<BR>So sling your hook to the history books,<BR>And no-one will cry boo-hoo!</P>
<P>Trident, Trident - Maggie has gone too far;<BR>The nuclear tyrant will surely lead us to war.<BR>Before she starts attacking, we'll have to send her packing,<BR>And pull the chair on all who gain<BR>From the criminal arms bazaar!</P>

<H2>Tavern in The Town</H2>
<P>There is a tavern in the town,<BR>And there my true love sits him down, sits him down,<BR>And drinks his wine mid laughter free,<BR>And never, never thinks of me.</P>
<P><EM>Chorus:</EM><BR>Fare thee well, for I must leave thee,<BR>Do not let this parting grieve thee,<BR>And remember that the best of friends must part, must part.<BR>Adieu adieu, kind friends, adieu, adieu, adieu.<BR>I can no longer stay with you, stay with you.<BR>I'll hang my harp on a weeping willow tree,<BR>And may the world go well with thee.</P>
<P>He left me for a damsel dark, damsel dark,<BR>Each Friday night they used to spark, used to spark,<BR>And now my true love once true to me,<BR>Takes that dark damsel on his knee.<BR><EM>Chorus:</EM></P>
<P>Oh! Dig my grave both wide and deep, wide and deep,<BR>Put tombstones at my head and feet, head and feet,<BR>And on my breast carve a little turtle dove,<BR>To signify I died of love.<BR><EM>Chorus:</EM></P>

<H2>The Wild Rover</H2>
<P>I've been a wild rover for many a year,<BR>And I've spent all my money on whiskey and beer.<BR>But now I'm returning with gold in great store,<BR>And  never will play the wild rover no more.</P>
<P><I>Chorus:</I><BR>And it's no, nay never,<BR>No, nay never no more<BR>Will I play the wild rover,<BR>No never no more.</P>
<P>I went into an alehouse I used to frequent,<BR>And told the landlady my money was spent.<BR>I asked her for credit, she answered me, "Nay,<BR>For custom like yours I can get any day."<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>
<P>I took from my pocket some sovereigns bright,<BR>And landlady's eyes opened wide with delight.<BR>She said, "I have whiskies and wines of the best,<BR>And the words that I spoke you were only in jest."<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>

<P>O land of my fathers, O land of my love,<BR>Dear mother of minstrels who kindle and move,<BR>And hero on hero, who at honour's proud call,<BR>For freedom their lifeblood let fall.</P>
<P><I>Chorus:</I><BR>Wales! Wales! O but my heart is with you!<BR>And long as the sea your bulwark shall be,<BR>To Cymru my heart shall be true.</P>
<P>O land of the mountains, the bard's paradise,<BR>Whose precipice, valleys lone as the skies,<BR>Green murmuring forest, far echoing flood<BR>Fire the fancy and quicken the blood.<BR><I>Chorus:</I></P>

Something which can be corroborated by history, and whichwill be demonstrated in <I>The Freedom Server</I></p><p>The reason behind this was eloquently and succinctly illustrated by thegreat Thomas Paine, when he said: </p><center><b>"A long habit of not thinking a thing wrong,<br>	gives it a superficial appearance of being right..."</b></center><p>It is precisely because we have <I>not</I> accepted that political societiesare wrong (that is, societies based on coercion), that we believe they areright and will eventually work. Yet millennia of history shows this to notbe true, yet something our minds do not accept. We believe that tinkeringwith the mechanism will eventually fix it, and that enforcing the will ofone group of people on another produces a viable societal mechanism.</p><p>Our social structure is like a giant Rube Goldberg machine that continuesto fall apart and be patched. One for which the drawings were long ago lost,along with the configuration history. Yet the problem is that the basicpremises upon which the machine was designed are faulty (although in realityit just happened, and was not consciously designed), and it can <B>never</B>work using these basic premises.</p><p>Further, it is very important to understand that it is <B>only</B> increasedknowledge--new and useful kowledge--that truly solves problems. The problemsof society can <B>NOT </B>be fixed through violent means. Besides beingimmoral, violence and property destruction is irrational and only bringsincreased state repression and less chance that the problems can be fixed.The problems can not be fixed by marching and protesting for or againstthings. They can not be solved by inteference in the property of others.They can only be fixed by providing an alternative that is personally profitableto each individual.</p><p>What is necessary is to create a mechanism that works? One which is &quot;profitable&quot;for each individual, bringing an increased quality of life and continuouslyincreasing opportunity for each individual. The summation of individualsbeing a society. When this happens, and such a mechanism competes with thepolitical state in the marketplace, individuals will freely select the mechanismwhich is best for them. This allows a transition without disorder and propertydestruction.</p><p><I>The Freedom Server</I> will illustrate what is wrong and how to fix it,although the emphasis will be on fixing the problems. With a little bitof knowledge about what is wrong you will eventually learn to recognizethe examples yourself, which are myriad. It is more important to know <I>why</I>it is wrong, and how to fix it than to have endless renditions of the problems.You can read those everyday in what is euphemistically called "news."</p><p>Occasionally there will be intentional humor, yet this is not a subjectto be taken lightly. The evolution of man has been very long and very painful,more like a tragic comedy in many ways. And, when we could and should beon the verge of making the transition to a rational and durable society,we are faltering with quite probably disastrous, terminal results. We aresliding almost inexorably into an abyss filled with failed civilizations.And, as an astute observor will note, thare are no miraculous resurrectionsfor failed civilizations. And this time it is the sum-total of mankind thatwill disappear, and not one civilization out of many.</p><p>Our clue for this should be that history is mostly a rendition of &quot;TheRise and Fall of -----,&quot; and fill in the blank with the name of a failedcivilization. Together with the fact that the life span of each such failedcivilization has become shorter than the last. And, lastly, as we have seenin recent years, civilizations and societies around the world are inter-lockedin this dance of death. An economic problem in one country, even small ones,reverberates around the world. A war or other terrorist act sucks in a multitudeof nations. And the victims are almost never the perpetrators, who sit inguarded palaces and travel in bullet-proof limousines.</p><p>It is pathetic and tragic seeing ignorant people in a position of powerover the lives and destiny of all others. We have not learned who our trueleaders are: <I>individuals who create new and useful knowledge with thepotential of increasing the quality of life for all mankind.</I> Yet wevenerate and actually seem to respect not these people, but those whoselives have been devoted to the destruction of property-both tangible andintangible. Examples of this will appear in other sections of <I>The FreedomServer.</I></p><p>As one example to consider now before you go on, you might consider thatof Napoleon and Amp&egrave;re, who were contemporaries. Napoleon, besidesthe vast property destruction which occurred during his short reign, impoverishedEurope and France for a century. He rates about thirty pages in encyclopedias.Amp&egrave;re, the father of electromagnetism, the foundation of our modernworld, rates less than a page. Which is the truly important figure in history?And why? Which figure <I>should</I> children wish to emulate? Which figure<I>do</I> children wish to emulate? Why? What lessons can we learn fromthis?</p><HR><center><p><LI><B>Notice:</B></p></center><p>I did not intend to start this publishing venture until more material anda secure server were available, but certain personal events have made medecide to do it now, even though additional essays and other items willnot be added for a few weeks.</p><p>Where it indicates in the Table of Comments that certain things are notyet available, most of them have been written, but I am not yet sure howI wish to distribute them and on what basis.

I emphasize the fact that it is their bodies--and unfortunately theirbrains--which are dead, but not their ideas.</p><p>To illustrate a very important point, I would like to repeat here two ofthe quotations from those that appear elsewhere in these pages: </p><UL>  <LI>Horatius (Quintus Horatius Flaccus) {65 BC - 8 BC}    	&quot;<B>Exegi monumentum aere perennius.</B>&quot;  	  <LI>[<B>I have executed a memorial longer lasting than bronze.</B>     	<p>  	{The significance, endurance and power of <I>right</I> ideas, as opposed  	to the short-term influence of actions}]	</p></UL><p>In the film <I>The Land of the Pharaohs,</I> Pharaoh spent his life buildinga great pyramid to house his mortal remains and to preserve his life andits accomplishments in history. The pyramids are truly impressive, but wetend to think of them as an object, more than the person who created them.And they are slowly--and sadly--crumbling to dust.</p><p>About two thousand years ago, around 250 BC, one of the most&quot;important&quot; and well-known people in the world was the Romangeneral Marcellus. A contemporary of his, Archimedes, was virtuallyunknown. Tragically, and in defiance of the orders of Marcellus, one ofhis soldiers murdered Archimedes. </p><p>Now, more than two thousands years later, their roles--in the sense oftheir prominence in history--are reversed. The reputation of Archimedesand the recognition of his importance continue to grow, while that ofMarcellus goes down in history. The correct direction for all those whodestroy property and lessen the quality of life. In contrast to thosewho create property--especially in the sense of rational and moralknowledge that is useful in the creation of additional such knowledge.Knowledge that increases man's understanding of his world and has the<I>potential</I> to add to the quality of life. A potential greatlyattenuated by a social structure based on coercion that does notunderstand the difference between right and not-right.  The reputationof such people go <B>up</B> in history, not down. </p><p>The main goal of <I>The Freedom Server&copy;</I> is the correction of thisproblem. The knowledge and information presented here, and in the bookslisted herein, take a step in that direction. In connection with the abovethought on immortality and importance in history, and the knowledge to beobtained from the books listed here, it is worth considering the followingquotation:</p><UL>    	<p>  	<LI>Wren, Christopher {1632 - 1723} &quot;<B>...Lector, Si		monumentum requiris, circumspice...</B>&quot;	</p>		<p>	<LI>[<B>...Reader, if you seek his monument, look around...</B>].	</p>		<p>	<LI>Dictionary of Quotations, J.J. & M.J. Cohen, Penguin Books,		1985 Edition, p. 427	</p>		<p>	<LI>Inscription in St. Paul's Cathedral, London (Written by	Wren's son. It should therefore be properly ascribed to his son, but	I do not know the son's name at the moment, however the gratitude for	this beautiful and elegant tribute goes to the son of Christoper	Wren. He understood importance in history more than most people. It	was not the buildings themselves, but the knowledge of how to	design and build them.)	</p></UL><p>The books listed here, and many others not yet listed, have greatly influencedmy thinking, and it is with pleasure and gratitude to the authors, publishers,and booksellers that I list these books here.</p><HR>	<p>	<LI><B>Caveat Lector!</B>	</p>	<p>	As I may have said elsewhere, not everything in every book is	right, however almost any book has something of value in it.	Even something which is wrong may be an aid to learning <I>what</I>	is wrong, illustrating the problem, and providing clues to solution	of the problem. In reading any book a person should remember	what Leonard Reed said:	</p>	<UL>  	<LI>Reed, Leonard [suspected source - 1898 - 1983]  	</p>	<p>	<LI>&quot;Indeed, any serious student will want to read any book	with care and discrimination, gleaning from it such truth as he	can find, and rejecting that which to him seems false or	misleading.&quot;	</p></UL><HR><p>As I mentioned, this is not a book store in the sense of being able to orderthe books, although this could be true in the future. However, since I wantpeople to know where they may find the books, where known I have listedthe ISBN, the last known price, and at least one source for the book. Thekey to the source may be found by clicking on the abbreviation, which willtake you to the source code listing at the end of this document.</p><p>Lastly, it must be remembered that <B>all knowledge is related</B>, andthat no one book or essay will provide complete answers to a problem. Itis therefore necessary to read many things and, as Leonard Reed said, &quot;extractfrom them what truth you find&quot; add it to others, think and create hypotheses,and look for corroboration in the world around you. Only then can you createwhat is called a <I>theory.</I> </p><p>Books are listed alphabetically <B>by author</B>.</p><HR NOSHADE><CENTER><H4>| <A HREF="#A">A</A>| <A HREF="#B">B</A>| <A HREF="#C">C</A>| <A HREF="#D">D</A>| <A HREF="#E">E</A>| <A HREF="#F">F</A>| <A HREF="#G">G</A>| <A HREF="#H">H</A>| <A HREF="#I">I</A>| <A HREF="#J">J</A>|   <A HREF="#K">K</A>|<A HREF="#L">L</A> |</h4><h4>| <A HREF="#M">M</A>| <A HREF="#N">N</A>| <A HREF="#O">O</A>| <A HREF="#P">P</A>|<A HREF="#Q">Q</A>|<A HREF="#R">R</A>|<A HREF="#S">S</A>|<A HREF="#T">T</A>|<A HREF="#U">U</A>|<A HREF="#V">V</A>|<A HREF="#W">W</A>|<A HREF="#X">X</A>|<A HREF="#Y">Y</A>|<A HREF="#Z">Z</A> |</H4></CENTER><HR NOSHADE><CENTER><A NAME="A"></A><h2>A</h2><HR NOSHADE>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>] <HR NOSHADE><A NAME="B"></A><H2>B</H2></CENTER><HR NOSHADE><DL>	<DT><B>The Law</B> 	<DT>by Bastiat, Frederic 	<DT>ISBN 	<DT>Price - $2.95 (P) - 76 pages 	<DT><A HREF="#F">Foundation for Economic Education</A> 	<DT>Order Code: 21F </dl>    <dl>	<DT><B>Value & Price</B> 	<DT>by B&ouml;hm-Bawerk, Eugen von 	<DT>ISBN 0-910884-01-3 	<DT>Price - US$9.95 	<DT><A HREF="#L">Libertarian Press</A> </dl>	<dl>	<DT><B>The Discoverers</B> 	<DT>by Boorstin, Daniel J. 	<DT>ISBN 0-394-72625-1 	<DT>Price - $16.00 - 1985 - pb 	<DT><A HREF="#V">Vintage Books</A> </DL><p>One of the best history books ever written, it identifies many of thosein history who created property rather than destroyed it.

O. Box 302   <DT>Cheshire, CT 06410   <DT>Tel: (1-800) 272-8778 </DL>This book, a biography of Publius Cornelius Scipio--<CITE>Scipio Africanus</CITE>--wasoriginally published in the UK in about 1930 and went out of print shortlythereafter. It was not printed again until 1971, by Biblo & Tannen in NewYork. I think it is again out of print. <BR><BR>Publius Cornelius Scipio was a man far beyond his time. In an age of relativelygreater barbarism he was a decent man of great foresight, intellect, andhigh character. The major proof of this--although there are many others--ishis statement when offered the rulership of the Roman Empire, saying that&quot;no man should rule other men, and certainly not for a life time.&quot;Eventually he did accept the consulship for one year, but only as a tokenof his gratitude to the those who supported him in defense of his country--againstthe aggressor Hannibal--in the Second Punic War. <BR><BR>His relatively less significant achievement is that of being the greatestgeneral of all time, by his defeat of the man most people incorrectly believeto be the greatest general, Hannibal Barca. Scipio, in defense of his homeland,defeated Hannibal's forces in every battle they fought, although almostalways outnumbered by at least two to one, and up to five to one. And, intheir only personal encounter, he defeated Hannibal at the Battle of Zamaon 202 BC, August 19th, while outnumbered three to one, ending the war.Hannibal lost most of his army of 65,000 men, while Scipio lost a fractionof his 20,000 mean. <BR><BR>Conventional historians should at least recognize him as the founder and&quot;father&quot; of the Roman Empire for, after the defeat of Hannibal,Rome was the unchallenged master of the &quot;Occidental&quot; world. And,in fact, it can be said that Scipio, by his defeat of Hannibal, ensuredthat Europeans would have an Occidental heritage rather than the Orientalone they would have had had Hannibal won the Second Punic War. <BR><BR>It is almost certain that Gen. Douglas MacArthur had studied Scipio, bothin his display of military strategy and tactics, and in MacArthur's treatmentof Japan. Scipio appointed his defeated enemy, Hannibal, as Military Governorof Carthage, with the result that within a few years Carthage was more prosperousthan it had ever been. <BR><BR>Scipio's life offers many clues to those who wish to understand the problemsof the current society of man, and to the solution to these problems. <BR><P><CENTER><HR NOSHADE>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>] <HR NOSHADE></CENTER><H2><CENTER><A NAME="M"></A>M</CENTER></H2><HR NOSHADE><DL>  <DT><B>The Anti-Capitalist Mentality</B>   <DT>by Mises, Ludwig von   <DT>ISBN   <DT>Price - US$8.95 - Paper   <DT><A HREF="#F">Foundation for Economic Education</A>   <DT>Order No. 215 </DL><P><CENTER><HR NOSHADE>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>] <HR NOSHADE></CENTER><H2><CENTER><A NAME="N"></A>N</CENTER></H2><P><CENTER><HR NOSHADE>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>] <HR NOSHADE></CENTER><H2><CENTER><A NAME="O"></A>O</CENTER></H2><P><CENTER><HR NOSHADE>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>] <HR NOSHADE></CENTER><H2><CENTER><A NAME="P"></A>P</CENTER></H2><HR NOSHADE><DL>  <DT><B>The Age of Reason</B>   <DT>by Paine, Thomas   <DT>ISBN 0-806505-4   <DT>Price US$8.95 - Paper - 192 p.   <DT><A HREF="#CIT">Citadel</A> </DL>Certainly the best book ever published on the subject of religion.

Since thebook proposes a &quot;solution&quot; to the problems of society within thepolitical mechanism, the title represents are contradiction in terms. Freedomcan not exist in a politically-based society, and such a system is certainlynot &quot;revolutionary.&quot; There is nothing knew about the failed conceptof societal structures based on coercion. <BR><BR>The author suggests using unfettered capitalism as the solution to poverty,education, the health-care crisis and assorted other problems. That wouldbe a good idea, but when he suggests a &quot;flat&quot; income he is notsuggested true capitalism, showing that he does not understand what capitalismis--and isn't. There is nothing capitalist about a system that proposesto confiscate 17% of the income of its victims. Anything more than 0% isnot capitalism, but warmed-over socialism, communism, democracy, republicanismetc., as they all mean the same thing in principle: A society based on coercion,with the only thing left to decide being the style and extent of coercion.<BR><BR>A 17% tax means that people are &quot;only&quot; 17% slaves. But, does anyonebelieve that the politicians could give up local state and city taxes? Soit would be more. Perhaps 25% slavery. And then there is the problem oftaxes on alcohol and cigarettes. Besides raising revenue, they are alsoto control the usage of these items in order to &quot;protect&quot; thepeople from themselves. How would they do that without taxes? Well, of coursethey could require the usage of ration coupons for them... <BR><BR>At the same time the author and his subject are proposing a &quot;capitalist&quot;solution, the &quot;House Majority Leader&quot; is apparently proposingto usher in the true &quot;Big Brother&quot; system, with the American politicalmechanism trying yet again to introduce a national identity card so theycan have ever increasing control over their hapless victims. Why not justtatoo the SS number (a very appropriate designation) of each individualonto their arm, as the SS and GESTAPO (Geheim Staats Polizei) did underHitler? Apparently the author and subject feel that such a system had meritafter all. <BR></UL><H3><A NAME="PAINE"></A>Tom Paine: A Political Life</H3><DL>  <DD>by John Keane   <DD>Bloomsbury - 644 pp - &#163;25.00   <DD>ISBN 0-7475-2007-0 </DL><UL>There have been many books written about the Life of Thomas Paine, butvery few good books. Many books have been scurilous, outright attacks onPaine, often sanctioned and paid for by people who resented his attemptsto create better societal structures with freedom for the individual. Peoplesuch as King George III, who rightly feared Paine's concepts. <BR><BR>Until Keane's book, the only good and reliable book available was <I>TheLife of Thomas Paine</I>, by Moncure D. Conway. Keane's meticulous and scholarlyresearch has uncovered much information not available to Conway or, indeed,to any earlier biographers. <BR><BR>Keane, while I think he tries to be impartial, clearly recognizes the importanceof Paine and his relevance to the societal problems of our time. He is friendlytoward Paine, yet his work is clearly scholarly, presenting facts as theyare. He has uncovered and catalogued much new material related to Paine'slife. <BR><BR>Although I can't find a reference to it at the moment, I believe I readthat he is working on a Paine bibliography which, if so, is good news forthose respecting and having gratitude for the work of Paine. <BR><BR>I am grateful to Keane for his excellent biography, which I think will bethe new standard for a Paine biography. I recommend it highly. <BR><BR></UL><HR NOSHADE><H3><CENTER><A NAME="MCGE"></A>Reviews by Prof. Robert W.

Then, onceelected and having descended* to political office, the main objective isto be re-elected. To ensure achieving this objective, they will do virtuallyanything, as illustrated in this section.</p><UL><p>* Descending to political office <B>is</B> the correct direction, sincevirtually all political activites are immoral.(See the <A HREF="Glossary.html">Glossary of Terms</A> fordefinitions).</p><p>A politician can only be said to have &quot;ascended&quot; to a positionwhen they are no longer in a position to control the property and livesof others without the consent of the victim(s).</p></UL><p>Trading people, places, and things for votes. Their main objective is toremain in power--in control of other people's lives and money. The exhilarationof people kowtowing to you, and the knowledge that others are looking enviouslyat this process. The endless &quot;photo opportunities&quot; to enhanceone's position of power. The arriving, waiting, and departing limousines.The helicopters to make sure one is not caught in the traffic lesser mortalsare subject to, and which the politicians are unable to solve. (A dilutedand imparied form of socialist-capitalism is able to build more cars thanpoliticians can provide roads for.)</p><p>It is not so much the &quot;sleaze&quot; of politics that is significant,but rather the emptiness of the concept of one person or group of personscontrolling the lives and destiny of others through the mechanism of coercion.Even in the so-called &quot;democratic&quot; societies in which people supposedlygive their consent to this coercive process. Mainly, I believe, because&quot;it has always been this way,&quot; and because there seems not otherway for volitional societies to operate, which is of course not true.</p><p>Such coercive systems violate a basic law of nature regarding the behaviorof volitional beings which states that all concepts of happiness pursuedby <B>moral</B> means are equally valid. A corollary might be that any attemptby one individual to interfere in this process and the life of another personis of course immoral, and it should be obvious that it is counter-productiveand leads to disorder in a society.</p><p>Do you want someone else's idea of happiness substituted for yours? Do youwant their idea of happiness imposed on you? Is it realistic that groupsof people should have the same idea or concept imposed upon them? Forgettingfor the moment that such a thing is in any case immoral.</p><p>The word "sleaze" is often used to indicate corruption. But itshould be remembered that corruption can not exist unless one party to arelationship has an accepted and "authorized" ("legal," in politicalsocieties) ability to control the lives and properties of others withouttheir permission. Without this access to the monopoly on police powers whicha political state encompasses the concept of corruption loses all itsmeaning.</p><BR><HR NOSHADE><CENTER><H3>Sleaze</H3></CENTER><HR NOSHADE><table border>	<TR> 		<TH>Information Source</TH>		<TH>Political Action or Event</TH>		<TH>Translation/Reality/Comment</TH>	</TR>		<TR>		<TD><B>Sunday Times (London)</B><BR>			1996, March 3<BR>			"Clinton declares emergency over anti-Cuba protest"<BR>			p. 1-18 </TD>						<TD>			<p>			The "Commander in Chief" and Chief Draft			Dodger has declared a "National Emergency" over Cuba's			shooting down of two US private aircraft.			</p>						<p>			He is also proposing a new law regarding property			expropriated by Castro after his rebellion against the			previous Ruler, Battista.

Any article willremoved at the request of the author or the Foundation.</P><P>The Foundation indicates the articles may be reprinted withoutpermission providing that appropriate credit is given, and that twocopies of such reprinted article(s) be provided to the Foundation.</P><P>I read all articles before deciding to publish them here, but I donot necessarily agree with everything in an article.  It is my policyto not criticize or say anything negative about any articles.  I may makea positive comment about something, or merely describe an article sothat a prospective reader will have some idea of its content.</P><P>I do not intend at this time to comment on any author by name in thissection of<CITE> The Freedom Server&copy;</CITE>, although I may ofcourse comment on an author and things they have said when Iincorporate their thinking in one of my own essays.  I preferto comment on concepts, irregardless of the author, unless of course itis something for which they should receive credit.  Either positive ornegative.  In this forum, I think it should be up to each individualreader to evaluate any article for correctness, and to assign a"credit rating" to the author based on the amount of "rightness" in thethinking and writings of the author.</P><P>I think that the articles are all superior to that which is normallywritten on the subject, although failure to include an article does notmean that I think it is inferior.  Mostly it means I have not had timeto read an article.</P><P>As a general statement, I think the articles tend more toward fixingwhat is an unfixable concept, and that they are only offering a"non-solution" within the current concept of operating a socialstructure based on coercion.  Just making it "nicer" and more "equitable"coercion.  With no solution that creates a rational and durable societalstructure.</P><P>That is my opionion.  But you, the reader, must make your own decision.</P><HR><p>I am beginning to supply documents in HTML format in addition tothe text and Adobe <b>Acrobat</b> formats.  These documents haveHyperText linked footnotes and links to related documents whereappropriate.</p><p>Not only will clicking on the footnote number in the document take youto that footnote, but there is a <b>Return</b> in the footnote, so thatclocking on <b>Return</b> will take you back to the paragraph fromwhich you started.</p><hr noshade><CENTER><H4>The Foundation for Economic Education.</H4></CENTER><P>	"Ever since 1946, the Foundation for Economic Education (FEE)	has been promoting an understanding and acceptance of the free	market, private property, limited government way of life and the	moral and intellectual principles which form the basis of the free	society.

It is my policyto not criticize or say anything negative about any articles.  I may makea positive comment about something, or merely describe an article sothat a prospective reader will have some idea of its content.</P><P>I do not intend at this time to comment on any author by name in thissection of<CITE>The Freedom Server<sup>&copy;</sup></CITE>, although Imay of course comment on an author and things they have said when Iincorporate their thinking in one of my own essays.  I preferto comment on concepts, irregardless of the author, unless of course itis something for which they should receive credit.  Either positive ornegative.  In this forum, I think it should be up to each individualreader to evaluate any article for correctness, and to assign a"credit rating" to the author based on the amount of "rightness" in thethinking and writings of the author.</P><P>I think that the articles are all superior to that which is normallywritten on the subject, although failure to include an article does notmean that I think it is inferior.  Mostly it means I have not had timeto read an article.</P><P>As a general statement, I think the articles tend more toward fixingwhat is an unfixable concept, and that they are only offering a"non-solution" within the current concept of operating a socialstructure based on coercion.  Just making it "nicer" and more "equitable"coercion.  With no solution that creates a rational and durable societalstructure.</P><P>That is my opionion.

Therationalizations I give for this libertarian sentiment are old ones such asaccentuating the dignity of the individual and letting the individual learnfrom example and from his own experience.

Assuch, they begin as totally arbitrary, although based on the best knowledgeavailable at the time.</p><p>As more knowledge is acquired on a subject, and an attempt is made to corroboratethe definition in the surrounding world, a definition may change.</p><p>When a definition can be corroborated in nature (the surrounding world)and appears to cover all cases, have no exceptions, and can be used to acquireadditional new, moral and useful knowledge it trends toward becoming anabsolute. That is, not subject to arbitrary standards of determination.</p><p>I admit to an attempt to add humor to some of these, but without dilutingthe correctness of the definition. And, this is done also to reinforce thefact that current usage of most of the major, operative word definitionsrelated to our social structures is almost always ridiculous, irrelevant,and immoral. And usually irrational.</p><p>If you do not believe that proper and precise definitions--semanticprecision--is important, consider the case of petrol and sugar.  If Iarbitrarily define what most people accept as "sugar" is "petrol," and thenas you if I may put some of this "petrol" (actually "sugar") in the petroltank of our car, will you agree?  If not, and you believe that semanticprecision is not important (just playing with words), why will you notagree to putting what is in fact sugar into your petrol tank?</p><hr><CENTER> <H3>Types of Definitions</H3></CENTER><p>I have provided definitions based on up to three concepts for anything defined,depending on the past and current usage "Average" or "Political"usage, and what should be the future or "Normal" usage.</p><LI><B>Average Usage</B> <UL>	<p>	<cite>	That which is current and may be amoral, moral, or immoral.	</cite>	</p>	<p>	However, so heavily ingrained in our minds is the concept that interference	in the property of another is "okay" if the "majority"	agrees, that generally--more times than not--the intention involves an act	of property interference.	</p></UL><LI><B>Normal Usage</B> <ul>	<p>	<CITE>That which is current, and moral or amoral. </CITE>	</p></ul><li><b>Political Usage</b></UL>	<p>	<cite>	That which is immoral, and probably also irrational.	</cite>	</p></ul><hr noshade><CENTER><H3>Important</H3></CENTER><p>You must think about what you read--look and think about the world aroundyou--and determine in your own mind if the definition accurately and consistentlyrefelects what <B>really</B> happens and represents a true indication ofthe principles behind events.</p><hr noshade><CENTER><H3>Nota Bene</CENTER></H3><p>In the event that various political states and politicians, and any of theirsupporters, disagree with some of the definitions herein that involve themor their activities, I suggest a test.</p><p>If one or more of the subjects of a political state breaks a political lawwhich does not involve an act of property intereference within the rationaland moral defintion of property as defined herein, and such subject or individualrefuses to be accept the punishment prescribed by such political law(s),that no harm will come to such person if they refuse to accept such punishment.</p><p>If the political state insists on punishing someone for doing somethingwhich is moral but is "illegal," then that political state isconfirming and corroborating the definitions herein.</p><HR NOSHADE><CENTER><H4>| <A HREF="#A">A</A> | <A HREF="#B">B</A> | <A HREF="#C">C</A> | <A HREF="#D">D</A> | <A HREF="#E">E</A> | <A HREF="#F">F</A> | <A HREF="#G">G</A> |  <A HREF="#H">H</A> | <A HREF="#I">I</A> | <A HREF="#J">J</A> | <A HREF="#K">K</A> | <A HREF="#L">L</A> | </h4>  <h4>| <A HREF="#M">M</A> | <A HREF="#N">N</A> | <A HREF="#O">O</A> | <A HREF="#P">P</A> | <A HREF="#Q">Q</A> |<A HREF="#R">R</A> |<A HREF="#S">S</A> |<A HREF="#T">T</A> | <A HREF="#U">U</A> | <A HREF="#V">V</A> | <A HREF="#W">W</A> | <A HREF="#X">X</A> | <A HREF="#Y">Y</A> |<A HREF="#Z">Z</A> |</H4></CENTER><HR NOSHDAE><CENTER><h2><A NAME="A"></A>A</H2></CENTER><H3>activist</H3><UL><H4>Average</H4><p><cite>An individual who plans or executes an act ofproperty intereference. </cite></p><p> One who advocates that the political state use its monopoly onpolice to promote the wishes and desires of the advocate and suppressthe ideas and wishes which contradict those of the advocate.

Politics is	the <cite>source</cite> of problems, not part of the solution.	</p>		<p>	What politicians and other non-thinkers usually mean by this, is	that a particular problem should be solved through "peaceful"	means, rather than resorting to <cite>naked</cite> force.  I emphasis	the word "naked" because all so-called political "solutions"	involve the use of force, as that is the main,	operative-characteristic of politics.  The imposition of the will	of a guilty politician through the mechanism of the monopoly on	police powers.	</p>		<p>	And, a solution using naked force--such as the military--is of	course a "political solution," since--by definition--the military	is a branch of politics, and a part of the politician	mechanism and process.	</p></ul><hr><H3>politician</H3><UL><p>Politicians come in three types:</p><H4>civil politicians</H4> <p>The dominant coercive individual in so-called democratic societies,in which they control the lives of all others through a system of fraudand mind-control, and covert force. In the area of fraud--as opposed toforce--they compete with and utilize their religious brethren forcontrol of the masses through the mechanism of mind-control and fraud.</p><p>In earlier political societies, in which the tribes (politicalentities, now called nations, countries, provinces, counties, cities,etc.) were smaller, this position was occupied by a person with thegeneric title of "Chief." As the concept of coercion wasrefined, the Chief allied himself with the Witch Doctor.</p><p> The official cooperation between civil and religious politiciansfor their mutual benefit, and to the detriment of the specie, occurredat the Council of Nicae in +325. This was the same council at which--bymajority vote--mortal human beings decided on the "trinity"concept of the "father, son, and holy ghost." Defeating the"god is only god" faction of Arius, who was then declared aheretic and "excommunicated" from the ranks of officiallyrecognized religious politicians.</p><p>There are two basic types of politicians:</p><ul>	<h4>Those Out of Power</h4>		<p>	Their main activity is to criticize everything done by those in	power, saying how they will provide more and better "services"	to their victims if and when they come to power.	</p>		<h4>Those in Power</h4>		<p>	Their main acitivity is to dispense largesse and obfuscation as	necessary to assure that they stay in power. Thus they must	defend themsleves against the outrageous proposals to provide	even more things "free" to their victims than the opposition	proposes to provide.	</p>		<h4>Result</h4>		<p>	It assures the continuing decline of each societal group, although	people sometimes have the <cite>illusion</cite> of an increasing	quality of life brought on by advances in technology.  As the	politicans continue to try to make it unproductive to produce	things.	</p></ul><H4>military politicians</H4>In so-called democratic societies they are nominally subject to controlof their civil associates. In non-democratic societies they often have thedominant role in controlling their subjects, using first force and thenfraud (the reverse of the usual "democratic" r&eacute;gime) asnecessary to achieve their objectives. Although it should be noted thatdemocratic, socialistic, communistic, and dictatorship form of politicalstates are no different in principle, only in the style used for achievingthe objectives of the r&eacute;gime. <BR><BR>In earlier political societies, in which the tribes (political entities)were smaller, this position was occupied by a person with the generic titleof Chief. As the concept of coercion was refined, the Chief allied himselfwith the Witch Doctor. <BR><BR><H4>religious politicians</H4>Playing on the need of volitional beings for security in the sense ofunderstanding their environment and fellow beings, they offer pseudo-answers. Generallylacking the military force available to the other two types of politicians,they depend almost exclusively on fraud coupled with mysticism. <BR><BR>In earlier political societies, in which the tribes (political entities)were smaller, this person generally had the generic title of Witch Doctor.<BR><BR>As political entities have evolved, the function of Witch Doctor and Chiefhave been combined, with the political ruler employing both concepts (forceand fraud) to achieve desired ends. <BR><BR><B>General Comment</B> <BR><p>It should be noted that each of the three groups use the other two to gain greater control over their subjects.

That is, not subject to arbitrary standards ofdetermination.</p><p>I admit to an attempt to add humor to some of these, but withoutdiluting the correstness of the definition.  And, this is done also toreinforce the fact that current usage of most of the major, operativeword definitions related to our social structures is almost alwaysridiculous, irrelevant, and immoral.  And usually irrational. </p><center><h3>This Section</h3></center><p>This section contains words from the social sphere which have beengiven precise, unvarying definitions.  They should be considered absolutewithin the definition of that word.  Unless otherwise indicated, thesedefinitions should be considered as the "normal" definition for theword, as explained in the essay on that subject.</p><p>Words which are explained in the Glossary of Terms will often berepeated here.  In the Glossary there is usually an explanation associatedwith the word, while here there is generally no explanation.  If yousee a word here and would like to read a discussion of thedefinition, please refer to the <a href="Glossary.html">Glossaryof Terms.</a></p><hr><center><h3>Important</h3></center><p>You must think about what you read, look and think about the worldaround you, and determine in your own mind if the definitionaccurately and consistently refelects what <b>really</b> happensand represents a true indication of the principles behind events.</p><hr><center><h3>Nota Bene</h3></center><p>	In the event that various political states and politicians, and	any of their supporters, disagree with some of the	definitions herein that involve them or their activities, I	suggest a test.</p><p>	If one or more of the subjects of a political state breaks a political	law which does not involve an act of property intereference within	the rational and moral defintion of property as defined herein, and	such subject or individual refuses to be accept the punishment	prescribed by such political law(s), that no harm will come to such	person if they refuse to accept such punishment.</p><p>		If the political state insists on punishing someone for doing	something which is moral but is "illegal," then that political	state is confirming and corroborating the definitions herein.</p><p>	If the shoe fits, wear it with shame.  If it pinches, think,	modify your actions accordingly, and go up in history--join	the mainstream of civilization.</p><hr noshade><center><h3><a name="IND">Index</a></h3><h4>|<a href="#A">A</a> |<a href="#B">B</a> |<a href="#C">C</a> |<a href="#D">D</a> |<a href="#E">E</a> |<a href="#F">F</a> |<a href="#G">G</a> |<a href="#H">H</a> |<a href="#I">I</a> |<a href="#J">J</a> |<a href="#K">K</a> |<a href="#L">L</a> |<br></h4><h4>|<a href="#M">M</a> |<a href="#N">N</a> |<a href="#O">O</a> |<a href="#P">P</a> |<a href="#Q">Q</a> |<a href="#R">R</a> |<a href="#S">S</a> |<a href="#T">T</a> |<a href="#U">U</a> |<a href="#V">V</a> |<a href="#W">W</a> |<a href="#X">X</a> |<a href="#Y">Y</a> |<a href="#Z">Z</a> |<br></h4></center><hr><center>[<a href="#TOP">Top of Page</a>]</center><hr noshade><center><h2><a name="A">A</h2></center><hr noshade></center><h3>activist</h3><ul>	<h4>Normal</h4>		<cite>	An individual who plans or executes an act of property	intereference.	</cite></ul><hr><h3>[an] authority</h3><ul>	<h4>Normal</h4>		<p>	<cite>	An individual who has useful knowledge concerning a subject on	which they make a statement.	</cite>	</p>		<h4>average</h4>		<p>	<cite>	An individual who, in all probablility, has little useful knowledge	on a subject on which they make a statement.	</cite>	</p>		<h4>political</h4>		<p>	<cite>	An individual with coercive powers.	</cite>	</p></ul><hr noshade><center>| <a href="#TOP">Top of Page</a> |<a href="#IND">Index</a> |</center><hr><center><h2><a name="B">B</h2></center><hr noshade></center><h3>bias</h3><ul><cite>A preference for something, arrived at after the act ofdiscrimination (qv).</cite></ul><hr noshade><center>| <a href="#TOP">Top of Page</a> |<a href="#IND">Index</a> |</center><hr><center><h2><a name="C">C</h2></center><hr noshade><h3>Carlsoncopy</h3><ul>	<p>	<cite>	A photocopy.	</cite>	</p></ul><hr><h3><a name="CIT">citizen</h3><ul>		<p>	<cite>	An individual whose life and property is controlled by a	political state.	</cite>	</p>		<p>	See <a href="#SLAV">slave</a>, [syn] in this section.	</p></ul><hr><h3><a name="COLON">colonialism</a></h3><ul>	<p>	<cite>	The situation in which one political state rules another.	</cite>	</p>		<p>	See <a href="Glossary.html#COLON">colonialism</a> in	Word &amp; Concept Discussion.	</p></ul><hr><h3><a name="COM">communism</h3><ul>		<p>	<cite>	A societal structure based on coercion, in which the political	state professes to own the means of production and all	property.	</cite>	</p>		<p>	See synonyms <a href="#SOC"> socialism</a> and	<a href="#DEMO">democracy</a> in this section.	</p>		<p>	See discussion under <a href="Glossary.html#COM">communism </a>	in the Word &amp; Concept Discussion.	</p></ul><hr>	<h3>competence</h3><ul><cite>The relationship of moral things attempted related to the success atachieving the desired objectives.</cite></ul><hr><h3><a name="CON">confidence</h3><ul>			<p>	<cite>	Belief in something based on rational reasons.	</cite>	</p>		<p>	See also <a href="#FAI">faith</a> [ant.] in this section.	</p></ul><hr><h3>conservative</h3><ul>	<h4>Normal</h4>		<cite>		One who conserves something.		</cite>		<h4>Political</h4>			<cite>		One who conserves the concept that there should be political		entities wherein the activities of all members of the entity		are controlled through a monopoly on police powers.		</cite>				<p>		In politics, among the things "conserved" are:		</p>				<li> The "right" to make war and conquer places;		<li> The "right" to engage in what would be called "conspiracy"			if done by a subject of the r&eacute;gime;		<li> The "right" to seize property of the subjects of the			r&eacute;gime under concepts of "eminent domain";		<li> The "right" to "manage" (mismanage?) the economy;		<li> The "right" to maintain what is essentially a "monarchial"			system, in which "The ruler has been voted out, there is			a new one, long live the system" prevails;		<li> The "right" to operate at large and increasing financial			deficits;		<li> The "right" to do the same or different things that a			"Republican, Democrat, Liberal, Tory, Socialist," etc.			would do, while maintaining that it is a "different,			wonderful, new" idea, and will finally eliminate all			inequities and bring universal prosperity, etc., etc.				<p>		For all of these, the "right" exists.

Since this seems to be awaste of time, how about another approach? <BR><BR>How about looking at the value received from what is commonly called &quot;politics,&quot;and the value received from what is commonly called &quot;science&quot;?And also from &quot;business,&quot; even if you might initially feel thereis no value to be received from business. And, if you feel that way, youmight consider whether the microwave oven, frozen food, a Sony Walkman,or the jet aicraft which takes you to your &quot;dream holiday&quot; isof any value to you. Those come both from &quot;business&quot; and &quot;science.&quot;<BR><BR>To do this we must define what we mean by &quot;value&quot; in society.How about keeping it simple and just saying that it is: <BLOCKQUOTE><CITE>Anything which has the potential for adding to the qualityof life of the individual. </CITE></BLOCKQUOTE>Thus, if something <B>will</B> or <I>may</I> add to the quality of life,and almost certainly will not detract from it, then it is of &quot;value&quot;to society. And, conversley, something which does not add to the qualityof life, and may very well make life worse, has no &quot;value&quot; forsociety. We must also bear in mind that value for a particular society isthe sum-total of the value for each individual in that society. <BR><BR>Please examine the following and see whether you feel people and activitiesin the &quot;Mainstream of Civilization&quot; offer the potential for addingvalue to your life, or if it is the concept of politics that will add valueto your life. <BR><BR><HR NOSHADE><H3><CENTER>1996, Month</CENTER></H3><P><CENTER><TABLE border> <TR> <TH>MAINSTREAM OF CIVILIZATION</TH> <TH>POLITICS</TH></TR> <TR> <TH>Hope for patients with spinal injuries.</TH> <TH>Crackdownon late payers.</TH> </TR> <TR> <TD> <BR><BR>Two American medical doctors, brothers Charles and Jay Vacanti, have succeededin growing nerve tissue. And, more importantly, they have been able to sendelectrical signals through the artificial nerves. <BR><BR>They have been aided for the work of Prof. Robert Langer of MIT, who inventeda plastic polymer structure which is able to mimic parts of the human body.<BR><BR>In their latest experiments, the Vacanti brothers filled the polymer frameworkwith donated human nerve cells and then fed it blood products and oxygen.The result was fresh nerve tissue, while the polymer--which is biodegradable--dissolved, leaving the &quot;rope&quot; of nerve tissue. Then, in a crucialexperiment, the brothers were able to send an electrical signal throughthe nerves. <BR><BR>&quot;We are just beginning to explore a new world,&quot; said Prof. Langer.<BR><BR></TD> <TD> <BR><BR>It is becoming a common occurrence for many companies--and especially largecompanies--to be late in paying their accounts payable. When the accountpayable is a small company with limited financial resources, this can bea disaster. It is estimated that perhaps 5,000 such small companies collapsedin the UK in 1995 because of such late payments. <BR><BR>Now the saviour of small business--the political state--will step in andrequire on-time payment. And, if such on-time payment is not made, theywill require publishing of the names of the culprits. <BR><BR>I agree that this is a problem, but the use of the police powers of thepolitical state has never solved any problem. They only create problems.Does anyone believe the conferences against terrorism, famine, poverty,etc., ever solves these problems? <BR><BR>The political state, and the concept that some person or group of personsmust control the property and lives of all others is the cause of man'sproblems. The sooner that this is learned, the sooner we can being to implementthe true solution to the problems of mankind. <BR><BR></TD> </TR> <TR> <TD><I>Daily Mail </I>(London)<BR>1996, March 11<BR>&quot;Hope for spine patients as doctors grow nerves in lab&quot;<BR>Page 1</TD> <TD><I>Daily Mail </I>(London)<BR>1996, March 11<BR>&quot;Crackdown on late payers&quot;<BR>Page 1</TD> </TR> <TR> <TH>David Packard Dies</TH> <TH>Bob Dole is Reborn</TH></TR> <TR> <TD> <BR><BR>David Packard, co-founder of Hewlett-Packard, Inc., died at Palo Alto, Californiaon 1996, March 26. <BR><BR>He and William Hewlett founded Hewlett-Packard in 1939 with a borrowed $538.Granted, with political-state debasement of the currency this may be equivalentto ten or one hundred times the amount today, but assuming it were one hundred,that would still be only $50,380. <BR><BR>The company now employees more than 100,000 people directly, and many timesthat number indirectly. It has created numerous entrepreneurs and millionaires,a myriad of inventions and products, and enhanced the quality of life formillions of people. <BR><BR>This is the legacy of David Packard and of a terribly crippled, state-hobbledand virtually ineffectual form of capitalism. Contrast this with the legacyof Mr. Dole and the political system, whose products are crime, pollution,inflation, wars, unemployment, famine, poverty, homelessness, continuallydeclining educational standards and medical care, and all of the other standardproducts and problems of political societies. <BR><BR></TD> <TD> Mr. Dole announces &quot;I'm the Nominee.&quot; That means thehe is vying with Mr. Clinton to descend to the position of Ruler of thetribal group known as the &quot;United States of America.&quot; <BR><BR>He has already spent considerably more than $538 in this quest. Before theelection he will have spent millions of dollars to put himself into theposition of controlling the lives, property, and destiny of millions ofpeople. And in perpetuating the political legacy of crime, pollution, inflation,wars, unemployment, famine, poverty, homelessness, continually decliningeducational standards and medical care, and all the other ills of socialstructures based on coercion. <BR><BR><B>Compare the worth to humanity of a David Packard and a Robert Dole</B>.<BR><BR>Interestingly, these stories appeared on the same page, in the same issueof the <I>International Herald Tribune</I>. <BR><BR></TD> </TR> <TR> <TD><I>International Herald Tribune</I><BR>1996, March 28<BR>&quot;David Packard Dies, Silicon Valley Giant and a Philanthropist.&quot;<BR>page 3</TD> <TD><I> International Herald Tribune</I><BR>1996, March 28<BR>&quot;I'm the Nominee, Dole Annouces&quot;<BR>Page 3</TD> </TR> <TR> <TH>MainstreamHeadline</TH> <TH>PoliticalHeadline</TH></TR> <TR> <TD>MainstreamStory</TD> <TD>PoliticalStory</TD> </TR> <TR> <TD><I>MainstreamPub</I><BR>date<BR>&quot;title&quot;<BR>Page</TD> <TD><I>PolPub</I><BR>Date<BR>&quot;title&quot;<BR>Page</TD> </TR> </TABLE> </CENTER><P><HR NOSHADE><BR><P><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>] </CENTER><P><HR NOSHADE><BR><P><CENTER><TABLE border> <TR> <TH>MAINSTREAM OF CIVILIZATION</TH> <TH>POLITICS</TH></TR> <TR> <TH>MainstreamHeading</TH> <TH>PoliticalHeading</TH> </TR> <TR><TD> MainstreamStory </TD> <TD> PoliticalStory </TD> </TR> <TR> <TD><I>MainstreamPub</I><BR>Date<BR>&quot;Title&quot;<BR>Page</TD> <TD><I>PoliticalPublication</I><BR>date<BR>&quot;Title&quot;<BR>Page</TD> </TR> <TR> <TH>MainstreamHeading</TH> <TH>PoliticalHeading</TH></TR> <TR> <TD> MainstreamStory </TD> <TD> PoliticalStory </TD> </TR> <TR><TD><I>MainstreamPub</I><BR>date<BR>title<BR></TD> <TD><I>PoliticalPub</I><BR>date<BR>&quot;title&quot;<BR>Page</TD> </TR> <TR> <TH>MainstreamHeadline</TH> <TH>PoliticalHeadline</TH></TR> <TR> <TD>MainstreamStory</TD> <TD>PoliticalStory</TD> </TR> <TR> <TD><I>MainstreamPub</I><BR>date<BR>&quot;title&quot;<BR>Page</TD> <TD><I>PolPub</I><BR>Date<BR>&quot;title&quot;<BR>Page</TD> </TR> </TABLE> </CENTER><P><HR NOSHADE><BR><P><CENTER>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>] <HR NOSHADE>&copy; 1995 - TheUniversal Salvage Corporation <BR><BR><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I> </CENTER><P><HR NOSHADE><B>Contact Information:</B><BR>E-Mail: administrator@Freedom-Server.co.uk<HR>The URL of this page is: <P><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Adobe.html&gt; <BR><HR NOSHADE></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

Perhapssometimes verbatim and in the same context and other times stated differently--butusing the same principles--in a different context. <BR><BR>There are very simple reasons for this, and it is something you should beaware of and think of, else you may think I am unintentionally repeatingmyself, and/or there is no sense to the repetition. <BR><BR>Also, I would like that state the basis on which the essays are based. <BR><OL>  <LI>Nature is comprehensible, and all knowledge is related;   <LI><BR>  <LI>Since all knowledge is related, I must leave many things &quot;hangingin the air&quot; and incomplete, else I need to repeat all useful knowledgecurrently existing, in addition to my additions to that.   <LI><BR>  <LI>Further, leaving something &quot;dangling&quot; from time to timeis a part of the teaching and learning process, requiring or giving peoplethe chance to think on their own about how the thought or discussion mightcontinue.   <LI><BR>  <LI>The discussion is about moral solutions only;   <LI><BR>  <LI>The political state is a mechanism based on property interference,or coercion;   <LI><BR>  <LI>Semantic precision is necessary for the creation of useful, moralknowledge   <LI><BR>  <LI>Our universe is a closed, thermodynamic model;   <LI><BR>  <LI>There is a difference between the unknown, the knowable, and the unknowable;  <LI><BR>  <LI>Actions which violate the laws of nature are intrinsically and, bydefinition, impossible.   <LI><BR>  <LI>Things which do not violate that laws of nature are possible, butmay be improbable, or can not be done at this time because of lack of knowledge;  <LI><BR>  <LI>Individuals whose occupation involves property interference or thedestruction of property are insignificant in long-term history;   <LI><BR>  <LI>There are epistemological tools which can be used to determine whetherany idea, proposed action, or action is right on an absolute basis, whetherit involves volitional or non-volitional concepts;   <LI><BR>  <LI>The <CITE>miasma</CITE> of false information under which we all live--ofthings we believe to be true merely because it has never been shown theyare false--so clouds our thinking that it is highly improbable most peopleeven realize there is a catastrophic, near-terminal problem with our societalstructures, and therefore that a solution is needed;   <LI><BR>  <UL>    <LI>And, if the solution is presented, lack of ability to comprehendit;     <LI><BR>  </UL>  <LI>Finally, because man--for the first time in history--has the technologicalability to destroy his own specie, time for implementing a solution is nowcritical and urgent.   <LI><BR>  <LI>While you may take exception to some or all of the above, these conceptswill be used and discussed in the essays of <CITE>The Freedom Server</CITE>which are written under copyright of the Universal Salvage Corporation.  <LI><BR>  <LI>If I were to discuss all of the above fully, such a discussion wouldthen consist of all of the existing essays, plus others yet to be written.I will however discuss some or all of them briefly here. Both as a foundationfor the essays, and as an &quot;appetizer&quot; for the essays. To giveyou something on which to base the discussions, plus something to thinkabout before, during, and after reading the essays.   <LI></OL>Before we start discussing things in some detail, two more thoughts: <BR><OL>  <LI>Always my intention is to discuss principles, and therefore quibblingover insignificant things is not in order and will hinder learning.   <LI><BR>  <LI>For example, in a following paragraph I talk about the time frameof man's existence as a specie, tossing out two million years as a figure.Whether it is one million or five million is not germane to the discussionof the principles involved.   <LI><BR>  <LI>The other is that it is much easier to refer to the specie as &quot;man,&quot;a term which was useful for many years until it fell into disrepute as abeing &quot;sexist.&quot;   <LI><BR>  <LI>Rather than spend time trying to work around it with cute phrases,I will continue to use the word <CITE>man</CITE> to indicate the dominantvolitional specie on this planet, which includes all ages and sexes of thespecie.   <LI></OL>Now, let us begin. <BR><BR><LI><B>Nature is comprehensible, and all knowledge is related.</B> <UL>When you think about it, that is the way it <CITE>must</CITE> be inany one universe. And, I believe that for an observer who could observetwo or more different universes, they would see that all knowledge is alsorelated between the observable universes. Why must this be true? <BR><BR>If not, we would have the ultimate chaos. A universe that did not work,was incomprehensible, and could not be &quot;made&quot; workable. Therewould be no life. A volitional creature faced with such a situation wouldself-destruct. <BR><BR>With all knowledge being related, it only remains for the volitional specieto begin the process of understanding how nature works-- defining the &quot;lawsof nature.&quot; A process which took the volitional specie on this planetabout two million years before they had discovered the first few basic laws.<BR><BR>For two million years there was no significant increase in our understandingof the laws of nature. Think of the hundreds of thousands of years it tookto domesticate animals and crops, and to acquire the beginnings of a technologyin metals. And then the hundreds of years to go from one metal to another.Think of the fact that as recent as several hundred years ago, there willstill major areas of the world where the wheel had not been discovered.<BR><BR>The names of most, if not all, of the individuals who created these innovationsmore than 3,000 years ago are probably lost forever. Yet without their achievementthere would have been no succeeding innovations. They are truly the &quot;unsungheroes&quot; of civilization. <BR><BR>Current political rulers and associated bureaucrats are parasites with nocreative ability or even interest in it, living off of and plundering thismagnificent legacy of civilization. <BR><BR>Then, in less than five hundred years, the increase in our articulationof the laws of nature was dramatic. Also interesting--and significant--was the delay of several hundred years in creating technological applicationsfrom these laws. In 1666 the basic concepts necessary to create the moderntechnological world were elucidated, yet it was another 200 years beforethe technological applications really began to appear. <BR><BR>Thus, it was only the past 150 years or so that there was any <CITE>significant</CITE>change in the way the specie lived. <BR><BR>For the first few million years: <BR><BR>  <LI>Effective social and creative life ended between sunset and sunrise;  <LI>The &quot;town crier&quot; was high technology in news distribution;  <LI>About seven miles (12 kms) was the maximum distance a very adventurousperson (and rich, since it would require a horse) would travel in a dayfrom their own village.   <LI>Most natural calamities were ascribed to angry gods;   <LI>Diseases were the work of witches and devils, and innocent adultsand children were murdered to end these episodes. <BR><BR>  <LI>Then, &quot;suddenly,&quot; the specie began to understand natureand some of its very basic laws--the only laws of any value. Then, <BR><BR>  <LI>No longer did social and creative life end at sunset;   <LI>Communication extended beyond the horizon, and was virtually instantaneous;  <LI>There was understanding of the true cause of why rivers rose and fell,crops grew and did not grow, there were electrical storms, etc. <BR><BR>  <LI>Man began to understand that nature was in fact comprehensible. And,the technology--in the form of moveable-type printing and books-- becameavailable for the recording, storing, and dissemination of what was learned.No many people could work on the same problems, and it was also seen thatknowledge created in one area could lead to the solution of problems inother areas. <BR><BR>  <LI>To realize the beauty and grandeur of this, and to appreciate ourunique position in time in the history of this planet and its volitionallife, you need only do and think of one thing.   <LI><BR>  <LI>Think of a graph, where the &quot;x&quot; axis is time, with a scalefrom zero to, say, two million years. The &quot;y&quot; axis is the numberof laws of nature understood at any one time. <BR><BR>  <LI>The curve is essentially flat for all but about 150-200 years of thattime. Then, suddenly, there is a &quot;knee&quot; in the curve, and it beginsan exponential rise. Occasioned by an event 330 years ago, which will bediscussed in another essay or essays. </UL><LI><B>The discussion is about moral solutions only.</B> <BR><UL>There can never be an excuse for the interference in the property ofanother. Property destruction and creation are mutually exclusive concepts.That should be obvious. It should also be obvious that you an not destroywhat has not been created. <BR><BR>It took man millions of years to build the beautiful cities with their artand books which existed in 1935. It took Hitler ten years to cause the destructionof much of that which it took the millions of years to create, along withthe lives of fifty million people. A &quot;few seconds ago&quot; on theevolutionary clock, those fifty million exceeded the population of the entireplanet. A few more second before that and it exceeded all those volitionalbeings who had ever lived on this planet. <BR><BR>Does it seem like a suitable destiny for the specie to be continually buildingand destroying? Is it something you want as the legacy of your life, andworld into which you want your biological successors to be born and be requiredto endure? <BR><BR>Surely that must be true, else why would we not only continue that pathin our current lives, but we fantasize it as the way of life for the future.We create a vision of a future world through what we euphemistically call&quot;science fiction&quot; in which we propagate the worst features ofour civilization into the future. <BR><BR>A world and universe in which there are &quot;galactic federations,&quot;something like a super &quot;united nations.&quot; Wherein there are roving&quot;battlestars&quot; taking on &quot;alien&quot; invaders. This is aprojection of wars with the neighboring tribe, a concept that has gone onfor millennia. And &quot;super crime syndicates&quot; which then of courserequire a &quot;super lawman&quot; to battle. This subject of &quot;falseheroes&quot; in history will be discussed in other essays. <BR><BR>If this is to be the destiny of man, what is the purpose of living? Withone group of people destined to create property, and the other to destroyit? Why bother? Why not just destroy everything now? Why bother creatingchildren if this is to be their destiny? Do we need both creators and destroyers?Is that is what is called &quot;the balance of nature&quot;? <BR><BR>The other animals of the planet only kill for food to survive, and onlyvery rarely is that their own specie. And those are generally only the predatorclass of animals. If they had the intellect to preserve food and distributeit through supermarkets, they might find that easier and less stressful.And then they would have more time to contemplate and enjoy nature. Takevacations, and things like that. <BR><BR>And yes, they do fight among themselves to see who will be the dominantanimal in their group, just as man does. But they are significantly lessintelligent, so we can &quot;forgive&quot; them. Or, more correctly, understandand empathize with their situation. <BR></UL><LI><B>Semantic precision is necessary to the creation of useful knowledge.</B><BR><UL>Unless people have mutually agreed and understood definitions therecan be no effective communication, with the attendant possibility of creatingnew and useful knowledge. <BR><BR>Think of four people, one each from the USA, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Australia.They wish to buy and sell property among themselves. The currency of eachtribal area is what is called a &quot;dollar.&quot; Yet the value on anabsolute basis is different for each. If they do not specify which typeof dollar they are talking about, they will not be able to conduct businesseffectively. <BR><BR>If some people interpreted horsepower to mean torque, or octane rating tomean tire pressure, you could not build a workable car. If people thoughtthat wave length was the same as impedance, there would be no television,computers, or anything involving what we call &quot;electronic&quot; or&quot;electrical&quot; equipment. <BR><BR>Why then can we expect things to work in the social sphere when there area myriad of ideas of what constitutes property, justice, crime, legality,inflation, price increase, liberal, freedom, democrat, democracy, socialist,conservative, human rights, and all the other operative concepts associatedwith social structures? <BR><BR>By definition, man--the animal who is the dominant volitional specie onthis planet--is a part of nature. Resident in the same universe as automobiles,penicillin, oxygen, cosmic rays, x-rays, water, etc. The laws of natureapply to man and his social structures as they do to all other parts ofour universe. If not, we are living a purposeless illusion. If that is true,I really do want to get off the celestial bus before it self-destructs.If that is not true, then I want to stop the bus and fix it before thereis a major accident. <BR></UL><LI><B>Our universe is a closed, thermodynamic model.</B> <BR><UL>Acceptance of this reality will allow us to solve the problem of thermodynamicpollution and determine the purpose of life. <BR><BR>Too much to discuss further here. <BR><BR></UL><P><CENTER><HR NOSHADE>|[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>]|<HR NOSHADE> </CENTER><P><LI><B>Individuals whose occupation involves property interference orthe destruction of property are insignificant in long-term history.</B><BR><UL>Why do we have twenty or thirty pages in an encyclopedia extolling thelife and +virtues&quot; of Napoleon, and less than a page for Newton? <BR><BR>We revel in the &quot;glory&quot; of the man who destroyed vast amountsof property and impoverished France for a century. Yet there is--what isin essence--only a passing mention for the man who created the IndustrialRevolution, and thus our modern technological world. Think of the amountof property that was destroyed, vs. the amount created. Which person isthe better role model in history? <BR><BR>Suppose you had spent a lifetime building up a successful business, hada wonderful marriage, and several very fine children. Now someone comesalong and destroys your business, your home, and all your property. <BR><BR>I am sure you would grab pencil and paper (your computers were no doubtlost) and write a flowing tribute to the person who did this. Dwell on thewonder, grandeur, and glory of this person's life. And tell your children,&quot;This is the person I wish you to emulate in life.&quot; This is whatyou would do, yes? So that your children would seek to accomplish what this&quot;wonderful&quot; person has accomplished. And, with luck, one of themcould be as &quot;successful&quot; as this person, perhaps even be a Hitler.<BR><BR>This in preference to something like solving the problem of cancer, Alzheimer'sdisease, being able to reconnect severed nerves, design a &quot;pollution-free&quot;automobile, find the solution to the problem of crime. <BR><BR>After all, what is the value of such mundane things compared to the abilityof being able to watch the wars of the future from your living room as ifyou were there on the battlefield, and to be able to send and receive faxesto your son or daughter on that battlefield, giving them hints on how tobetter annihilate the &quot;enemy.&quot; While at the same time perhapsbeing able to help by disrupting the faxes from an &quot;enemy&quot; fatherto his son on the battlefield. <BR><BR>That is the future we wish to create, yes? That is the true destiny forour specie, yes? I have seen something similar to that--being able to communicatewith your children on the battlefield--proposed as a model for the futureby a prominent North American politician. One who is in an ideal positionto assist in creating that future. <BR></UL><LI><B>There are epistemological tools which can be used to determine whetherany idea, proposed action, or action is right on an absolute basis, whetherit involves volitional or non-volitional concepts.</B> <BR><UL>There would be no point in discussing the problems of society if therewere no tools for repairing the problem. <BR><BR>It is knowledge--useful knowledge--which fixes problems. Even when the problemis a leaky faucet. Without the knowledge of how a faucet works, it wouldtake a very long time to fix it. If you have a new battery, a spare tire,a can of petrol, an air pump, a washer, an extra postal envelope, a hammer,a pipe wrench, an adjustable wrench, a pair of pliers, a screwdriver, anda drill, if you don't know which one to use, how to use it and when, youwon't fix the problem. Each item is the solution or part of the solutionfor a problem, but not knowing how to use the tools makes problem solutiona haphazard event. <BR><BR>The tools mentioned above were tangible tools. The tools for repairing aknowledge problem are intangible tools, those evolving from epistemology,or the study of the nature of knowledge. <BR><BR>For this we can examine what tools have been used successfully for the creationof useful knowledge in other subjects. We might ask ourselves if there areareas in which there has been relatively large and successful increasesin useful knowledge, and how this was done. And whether or not the lessonslearned there would be useful to us in creating a rational and durable civilization.<BR></UL>The answer to this is the purpose and function of <CITE>The Freedom Server.</CITE><BR><P><CENTER><HR NOSHADE>[<A HREF="#TOP">Top of Page</A>] <HR NOSHADE><BR>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation <BR><BR><I>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</I> </CENTER><P><HR><BR><B>Contact Information:<BR></B>E-Mail: administrator@Freedom-Server.co.uk<BR><HR>The URL of this page is: <BR><P><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Preface.html&gt; <HR NOSHADE></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

This can confirmed and measuredby:</p><UL>  <LI>crime   <LI>social disorder   <LI>wars   <LI>unemployment   <LI>state deficits   <LI>inflation, recessions, depressions   <LI>decline in the quality of medical care while the cost increases </UL><p>Most of what we believe to be correct and right about our social structure,and all knowledge except that related to what is normally called <I>science,</I>is wrong. Something which can be corroborated by history, and whichwill be demonstrated in <I>The Freedom Server</I></p><p>The reason behind this was eloquently and succinctly illustrated by thegreat Thomas Paine, when he said: </p><center><b>"A long habit of not thinking a thing wrong,<br>	gives it a superficial appearance of being right..."</b></center><p>It is precisely because we have <I>not</I> accepted that political societiesare wrong (that is, societies based on coercion), that we believe they areright and will eventually work. Yet millennia of history shows this to notbe true, yet something our minds do not accept. We believe that tinkeringwith the mechanism will eventually fix it, and that enforcing the will ofone group of people on another produces a viable societal mechanism.</p><p>Our social structure is like a giant Rube Goldberg machine that continuesto fall apart and be patched. One for which the drawings were long ago lost,along with the configuration history. Yet the problem is that the basicpremises upon which the machine was designed are faulty (although in realityit just happened, and was not consciously designed), and it can <B>never</B>work using these basic premises.</p><p>Further, it is very important to understand that it is <B>only</B> increasedknowledge--new and useful kowledge--that truly solves problems. The problemsof society can <B>NOT </B>be fixed through violent means. Besides beingimmoral, violence and property destruction is irrational and only bringsincreased state repression and less chance that the problems can be fixed.The problems can not be fixed by marching and protesting for or againstthings. They can not be solved by inteference in the property of others.They can only be fixed by providing an alternative that is personally profitableto each individual.</p><p>What is necessary is to create a mechanism that works? One which is &quot;profitable&quot;for each individual, bringing an increased quality of life and continuouslyincreasing opportunity for each individual. The summation of individualsbeing a society. When this happens, and such a mechanism competes with thepolitical state in the marketplace, individuals will freely select the mechanismwhich is best for them. This allows a transition without disorder and propertydestruction.</p><p><I>The Freedom Server</I> will illustrate what is wrong and how to fix it,although the emphasis will be on fixing the problems. With a little bitof knowledge about what is wrong you will eventually learn to recognizethe examples yourself, which are myriad. It is more important to know <I>why</I>it is wrong, and how to fix it than to have endless renditions of the problems.You can read those everyday in what is euphemistically called "news."</p><p>Occasionally there will be intentional humor, yet this is not a subjectto be taken lightly. The evolution of man has been very long and very painful,more like a tragic comedy in many ways. And, when we could and should beon the verge of making the transition to a rational and durable society,we are faltering with quite probably disastrous, terminal results. We aresliding almost inexorably into an abyss filled with failed civilizations.And, as an astute observor will note, thare are no miraculous resurrectionsfor failed civilizations. And this time it is the sum-total of mankind thatwill disappear, and not one civilization out of many.</p><p>Our clue for this should be that history is mostly a rendition of &quot;TheRise and Fall of -----,&quot; and fill in the blank with the name of a failedcivilization. Together with the fact that the life span of each such failedcivilization has become shorter than the last. And, lastly, as we have seenin recent years, civilizations and societies around the world are inter-lockedin this dance of death. An economic problem in one country, even small ones,reverberates around the world. A war or other terrorist act sucks in a multitudeof nations. And the victims are almost never the perpetrators, who sit inguarded palaces and travel in bullet-proof limousines.</p><p>It is pathetic and tragic seeing ignorant people in a position of powerover the lives and destiny of all others. We have not learned who our trueleaders are: <I>individuals who create new and useful knowledge with thepotential of increasing the quality of life for all mankind.</I> Yet wevenerate and actually seem to respect not these people, but those whoselives have been devoted to the destruction of property-both tangible andintangible. Examples of this will appear in other sections of <I>The FreedomServer.</I></p><p>As one example to consider now before you go on, you might consider thatof Napoleon and Amp&egrave;re, who were contemporaries. Napoleon, besidesthe vast property destruction which occurred during his short reign, impoverishedEurope and France for a century. He rates about thirty pages in encyclopedias.Amp&egrave;re, the father of electromagnetism, the foundation of our modernworld, rates less than a page. Which is the truly important figure in history?And why? Which figure <I>should</I> children wish to emulate? Which figure<I>do</I> children wish to emulate? Why? What lessons can we learn fromthis?</p><HR><center><p><LI><B>Notice:</B></p></center><p>I did not intend to start this publishing venture until more material anda secure server were available, but certain personal events have made medecide to do it now, even though additional essays and other items willnot be added for a few weeks.</p><p>Where it indicates in the Table of Comments that certain things are notyet available, most of them have been written, but I am not yet sure howI wish to distribute them and on what basis.

With this thought in mind,  when reading anything byanyone, it is important to remember the words of Leonard Reed: </p><ul><p> <cite> Indeed, any serious student will want to read any book</cite>[any writings] <cite> with care and discrimination, gleaningfrom it such truth as he can find, and rejecting that which to himseems false or misleading. </cite> </p></ul><p> Look at the world around you and see if you can verify in yourown mind what you have read. </p><h4>Note:</h4><p> If you wonder about the fact that almost none of my essays havefootnotes with referrals to sources for various thoughts, it isbecause the writing comes from my mind based on observations ofhistory and current events.  Except where I <b>do</b> provideexplicit credit, the ideas are essentially original or independentwith me based on my observations and thought concerning what I reador observe in the world around me. </p><p>At the same time, as indicated in the "Credits" section of theserver, I must give credit to my intellectual antecedents.  Those who havecreated intellectual or intangible property--the ideologicalflowstream of our specie--and thus constitute the mainstream ofhistory. And, for that term and concept I must give explicit credit to mygreat and wonderful Teacher.</p><p> With gratitude to my Teacher, and an obligation to him andmyself, one very major, on-going project is the creation of adatabase of those I suspect of having influenced my thinking, and tocreate and implement a system of credits and royalty accrual forthem. </p><p> By the very way in which knowledge is created, each individual isindebted to their intellectual antecedents.  Even if the personcreating new knowledge lives in a virtual vacuum and has only thework of two or three people on which to draw ideas from our specie'swarehouse of knowledge, those two or three people almost certainlyhad access to the entire warehouse. </p><p> Thus, we all owe gratitude to the entire intellectual mainstreamof history.  However, with the caveat that--by definition--this onlyincludes the creators of property, and not those who interfere in ordestroy property. </p><hr><p>If you would to comment on any existing or proposed articles pleasecontact the <a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co.uk">administrator</a> at The Freedom Server<sup>&copy;</sup>.</p><hr noshade><center><h3>Essays Available for Purchase</h3></center><p>Individual essays may be purchased, although it will becost-effective and convenient to have a subscription when available.</p><p>Those essays written and available for purchase have two differentprice ranges:</p><ol>	<p>	<li><a href="#ZPE">Zero Price Essays</a>	</p>	<p>	These are essays for which the price is zero, as opposed to	being "free."  This is an important distinction in a world in	which many things are advertised as being "free."  There are actually	very few things that are truly free--things for which there can	be or is no price.  In fact, the only one I know of is "access	to nature."  That must be free, although political states even	try--and sometimes do--control that also.	</p>	<p>	Actually, while access to nature (what this means will be explained	in an essay--it doesn't mean what most people assume it to	mean) should be free, any volitional specie has a very basic	price they must pay if they wish to survive in the long term. 	Meaning, a time scale concomitant with that of the existence of	their local universe. That price is that they must strive to explore	and understand their universe on a moral basis, and with a	rationality consistent with their understanding of their universe at	any one time.	</p>	<p>	This is a concept I have redefined  as the "Holy Grail" for any	volitional specie, resurrecting that term from the mystics and	restoring it to place of honor and significance.	</p>	<p>	<li><a href="#NZPE">Non-Zero Price Essays</a>	</p>	<p>	As this implies, there will be a price greater than zero.	</p></ol><hr>	<p>	<li><a href="#FCE">Forthcoming Essays</a>	</p>	<ul>	<p>	In addition to essays already written, I have a large backlog of	subjects on which I will write essays.

Why		there was lightning &amp; thunder, why there were seasons and		they changed, why there was food and then no food, etc.  And		the associated fact that life was extraordinarily difficult, and		the wish that it were better and "easier," and the creation of		an imaginary world in which this would be so.		</p>				<p>		Life on earth was truly "hell" in a relative sense for millions		of years, and only became partially better--and certainly more		bearable for many--through the discovery and understanding of		basic concepts of nature which lead to the introduction of what		is commonly called "technology."		</p>				<p>		However, life continues to be "hell" in a relative sense since		man still lives under the primitive tribal and societal concept		known as "politics."		</p>	</ul><hr>		<h4>On...Pollution</h4><ul> <p> When the subject of pollution is discussed, the firstthought is usually of smokestacks and automobiles belching smoke,polluted rivers and other graphic and obvious evidences of pollution.</p><p> The solution to the problems of traditional pollution is actuallyquite simple. The problem is that it releases so much energy--makingthe H-bomb seem like a firecracker in comparison--that the knowledgeof its implementation is much too dangerous in the hands of primitivesocieties based on coercion.  There are already enough ways for thevarious political r&eacute;gimes to kill their own subjects and thoseof other, competing r&eacute;gimes.</p><p> Yet there is another type of pollution that is <b>much</b> moredangerous, and which is preventing us from effectively solving themore graphic and obvious types of pollution mentioned above.  And ofcreating a rational and durable social structure.</p></ul><hr><h4>On...Societal Empowerment</h4><ul> <p> One of the hottest topics in the business world is that of"empowerment," and there are trends toward trying to implement anequivalent thing in society. </p><p> This essay will discuss this non-solution.</p></ul><hr><h4>On...A Rational System of Education</h4><ul> <p> Schools are a disaster almost everywhere, and the systemitself is a total disaster, based on improper concepts of education.Even the best schools use improper concepts. </p><p> This essay outlines the very simple principles of an educationalsystem which is also very simple to implement.  In principle, thebest teachers should have incomes that exceed the highest incomesexisting in the current business world.  Morally and rationally,every student--or parents of students--must pay for the educationtheir children receive, and for their education only.  The essaydescribes a system in which it is possible for any child to availthemselves of the best and highest paid teachers, and the mostexpensive education.</p></ul><hr><h4>On...There Must Be Rules</h4><ul> <p> When a solution to societal problems that does not involvepolitical laws is discussed, the first response is "...but there<b>must</b> be rules." </p><p> This is very true, but only one, very simple "law" or rule isrequired. This then brings up two more complaints.  One is that "Itis a good idea, but it won't work."  The second is "Yes, but how doyou 'enforce' the rule in such a system?" </p><p> The first follow-on subject is covered in a separate essay asindicated below.  The latter subject is covered in <cite>FalseAlternatives and Human Destiny.</cite> </p> </ul><hr><h4>On...That's a Good Idea, but It Won't Work.</h4><ul> <p> This statement is very common, but represents an internalcontradiction.  If something is a good idea, it <b>will</b> work,else it is not a good idea. </p><p> This subject dwells on the science of epistemology, the natureof knowledge.  Included is a brief discussion of the differencebetween hypotheses and theories, and how knowledge is created. </p></ul><hr><h4>On...Political vs. Moral Solutions to Problems</h4><ul> <p> Politics and morality--and rationality--are mutuallyexclusive concepts, which is why there has never been a politicalsolution to any problem, in the sense of a moral and rationalsolution. </p><p> When there is a "disturbance" with the threat of war or militaryaction, a common statement is "...we need to find a 'political'solution to this."  The implication is that this will be a "peaceful"solution.  Yet this is not possible under the non-principles on whichpolitics is based.  A "political solution" to a problem would be tobomb the "offending" people into oblivion, since the military ismerely a branch of politics and thus a part--a very essentialpart--of the political system. A military solution <b>is</b> a"political solution" to the problem. </p><p> This essay discusses the true nature of politics, and theinternal logic contradictions within it as intimated by the title.</p></ul><hr noshade><center>[<a href="#TOP">Top of Page</a>]</center><hr noshade><h4>On...Inflation is Not a Price Increase, and<br> A Price Increaseis Not Inflation.</h4><ul> <p> I know of only a few people on this planet who couldcorrectly be termed "economists," and those have been virtuallytotally ignored. Some of them have sold millions of copies of theirbooks, but it is obvious that--assuming they have been read--eitherno one understood what they read or, worse, that they did not believevolitional life was worth trying to save on this planet.  There seemsto be no other excuse for the nonsense that passes for what happensin the financial world. </p> </ul><hr><h4>On...The Problems of Societal Transition.</h4><ul> <p> A major problem in illustrating an advanced, rational, anddurable society as a substitute for the failed concept in use today,is "Yes, it might work, but how do we get there?" </p><p> This is a major, very real problem, as the distortions caused bymillennia of coercion-based societies makes it difficult to breachthe gap, and make the transition to a durable societal structure.  Adifficulty that is now increasing almost exponentially. </p><p> This essay discusses the problem and how to handle it in arational and <b>moral</b> manner that will increase the quality oflife, not only for those who participate in the solution, but for allbeings. </p> </ul><hr><h4>On...Marriage and Other Political Licenses.</h4><ul> <p> What makes the political state such an expert on marriagethat it should issue marriage licenses?  Why should <b>anyone</b>believe that they need a political license to be married?  Is it alicense that makes a marriage? </p><p> A political state requires and issues marriage licenses tofurther their control over their subjects and to provide anadditional revenue source.  Other license requirements, such as formedical doctors, lawyers, and a myriad of other functions arerequired for the same purposes, plus the ostensible "benefit" that--by requiring a license--the state will therefore guarantee thequality of services provided.  I am sure everyone agrees this hasbeen the result, and that there are no medical or legal quacks. </p><p> This essay discusses this situation and the rational and<b>moral</b> solution to the problem of guaranteeing the quality ofservices. </p></ul><hr><h4>On...Death and Taxes.</h4><ul><p> It is often said that the only things certain in life are "deathand taxes."  The only thing certain within that concept is that ifsocietal systems in which the mechanism of taxation is a dominantfeature continues, that death of the associated volitional specie is acertainty. </p> </ul><hr><h4>On...Why "Think Tanks" Have Never Solved Any SocietalProblems.</h4><ul> <p> The so-called "Think Tanks," and especially those related tothe solving of man's societal problems, are really just havens forfuzzy-logic thought processes, based in false premises. </p><p> A seemingly endless stream of papers on societal ills such asinflation, unemployment, war, deficits, terrorism and assorted otherthings have been spewing forth from the "Think Tanks." Meanwhile, theproblems of society get worse, not better. </p><p>There is a basic reason for this, the recognition of which willdrastically alter the institution.</p></ul><hr><h4>On...Hereditary Rule.</h4><ul> <p> "The King is Dead--Long Live the King."  This is the imageof hereditary rule.  Something the so-called "democratic societies"have long since dispensed with, yes?  The image is different than thereality. </p> </ul><hr><h4>On...Fighting for Causes.</h4><ul> <p> "Fighting for (a cause)" has the image of a noble, solitaryindividual struggling to "right a wrong."  Yet "fighting" is anartifact of war, and the techniques of war are often used, includingthe murder of those who do not agree with the "fighter."  Is this theway to solve the problems of society? </p> </ul><hr><h4>On...the Stoplight Mentality</h4><ul> <p> Increasingly in political states, that which is notexpressly permitted is assumed--and may actually be--prohibited. Thiscreates an increasingly timid and therefore incompetent group ofpeople with decreasing self-esteem.  This in turn increases theclamor for "more and better laws" to "protect the people." This leadsto a general decline of the quality life and the eventual death ofpolitical structures. </p> </ul><hr noshade><center>[<a href="#TOP">Top of Page</a>]</center><hr noshade><h4>On...Minority vs. Majority Rule</h4><ul><p>The typical image of minority rule is that of a small"elite" or perhaps "aristocratic" group of people ruling all others.Majority rule is thought of as, well, "the majority" of allpeople deciding what they want for themselves.  The most common formbeing that of "representative" government in the form of a republic.The truth of what happens in such a society is much different thanthe image.</p><p>So-called "self-governing" through a representative or republicform of political state presents an internal contradiction in termsand has a hidden trap.  It creates a "representative body" or a"middle-man" group.  These middle-men represent an organization thatacquires a life of its own, becoming a self-perpetuating group thatin fact acts as a ruling minority that is no different than traditionalminority rule by an elite or aristocratic group such as a hereditarymonarchy.</p><p> In fact, such a group is much more dangerous than that of atraditional hereditary monarchy for reasons explained in the essay.</p></ul><hr><h4>On...The Rights of Man</h4><ul> <p> As pointed out by Keane in his recent biography of Paine."Tom Paine: A Political Life" (Bloomsbury Publishing plc - 1995),"The Rights of Man" by Thomas Paine was--relatively speaking-- themost widely read book of all time, in any language. </p><p> It was almost "heretical" in nature, calling for a totally newand different societal structure based on representative"government," in which the people would determine how they would beruled.  It represented such a huge intellectual leap that neither Paine--norothers--could foresee that this was only an interim solution tosocietal problems, which would create its own problems. Paine shouldnot be faulted nor criticized for this. </p><p> This essay will discuss the reason the problem could not beforeseen, and provide pointers to the next and last step necessaryin the creation of a rational and durable societal structure. </p></ul><hr><h4>On...Definitions</h4><ul> <p> This essay discusses the epistemological basis for worddefinitions and the need for semantic precision as the basis foreffective communication and the development of new and usefulknowledge. </p><p> This essay will also explain why I try to avoid the use ofcertain words, emphasize others, and the attempt--not alwayssuccessful-- at semantic precision.</p></ul><hr><h4>On...Financing Medical Research</h4><ul> <p> Innovation in general is not financed properly, but medicalinnovation is a special victim of a primitive concept of innovationcompensation.  The medical field is also a victim of the concept thatthere should be zero or a very small profit from medical advances.</p><p> This essay will describe a medical innovation compensation systemthat has the potential for creating startling improvements in medicalcare.  The reason I had to use the word "potential" is that thepolitical state acts as a tremendous hindrance to medical advances.There is also a simple, moral solution to this problem. </p> </ul><hr><h4><a name="LAND">On...the Land of the Pharaohs</h4><ul> <p> Volitional beings with a very short life span, such as iscurrent on this planet, continuously strive for ways to mark theirexistence and the validity and significance of their life.  Thosewith no valid understanding of the concept of property and ofimportance attempt to validate and signify their life through theerection of stone or metal monuments.  There is an indirectrelationship between this and the durability of the associatedsocietal structures and civilization in general. </p><p> The reader can gain an insight into this concept by some thinkingon the statements of Horatius and Wren in the list of <ahref="Quotations.html#HORATIUS">Quotations.</a> </p><p> See also <a href="#POP">On...Popularity and Importance.</a></p></ul><hr><h4>On...Satisfaction of Individual Need in a Rational Society</h4><ul> <p> The wishes and desires of individual volitional beings are,for all practical purposes, unbounded and very great.  For a societyto be durable, these wishes and desires must be balanced against thetrue <b>need</b> for physiological survival to arrive at a clearunderstanding of the concept of "need." </p><p> Based on the carbon-oxygen life cycle on this planet, the individualvolitional being requires water and food for physiological survival.And, except in temperate and/or warm climates, shelter from theelements of weather.  Other life forms in other parts of theuniverse--and the associated volitional beings--could derive theirenergy from a chlorine cycle, radiant energy, or some other means andthus have different physiological needs. </p><p> Beyond that, the satisfaction of wishes and desires can only beachieved and restrained in a rational and moral manner based on theability of each individual to satisfy these wishes and desires<b>without interfering in the property of another</b>.  Failure toobserve this concept results in a societal structure with a built-inself-destruct mechanism.  A society that will pass through increasingchaos until its ultimate and inexorable demise.  On this planet thedust-bin of history is rapidly filling with such failed societies.</p><p>In the past this could be viewed as not being critical since--althoughrepresenting the ultimate personal tragedy for each effectindividual--the volitional specie on this planet did not yetpossess the technological ability to destroy its own specie.  Thisis no longer true.</p><p>At the risk of sounding repetitious, the purpose of these essaysis the creation of a rational, moral, and durable mechanism thatprevents this disaster.</p></ul><hr><h4>On...Judges, Flower-Show and Political</h4><ul> <p> There are rational and moral concepts of "judging," and thenthere are political concepts of the subject. </p><p> This essay will discuss the societal implications of the subject.</p></ul><hr><h4>On...Free Trade</h4><ul> <p> As a concept, free trade has almost universal appeal andacceptance. Yet when there are attempts to implement truly freetrade, almost everyone wants to protect some product or service. </p><p> As is always the case in politics, false advertising is rampant.A case in point is the so-called North American Free Trade Agreement,or NAFTA.  In reality, it should be called the North American<b>Restrictive</b> Trade Agreement (NA<b>R</b>TA), because trade isnot free, and is certainly restricted. </p><p> The natural interest and condition of volitional beings is tofreely exchange goods and services.  It is only politicalstates, for their own nefarious reasons--including the ability to"justify" their continued need and existence--which wish to regulatetrade.  If restricted trade is a good idea, why not protect the"interests" of Los Angeles against those of San Francisco? Or twoneighbors across the street?  It is only primitive concepts of life,property, prosperity, money, and other things which prevent freetrade.</p></ul><hr noshade><center>[<a href="#TOP">Top of Page</a>]</center><hr noshade><h4><a name="POP">On...Popularity and Importance<a/></h4><ul><p>We have an increasingly distorted view of importance on thisplanet, equating it with popularity.  With a correct understanding ofthe two concepts, people such as Tesla and Maxwell should be amongthe most popular people today.  The reason being is that it is Teslawhose ideas power and light the modern world.  And Maxwell whoseideas give us virtually instant, world-wide communications and thetechnological devices which bring us television and radio.</p><p>Conceptually, there is also nothing wrong with the popularity ofanyone who brings happiness to people and increases the quality oflife.  Thus, "entertainers" are also important in the properdefinition of the word.  The problem at the moment is the failure toassign an "importance quotient" to achievement and to understand andappreciate the value of those such as Tesla and Maxwell.  And, tothen provide continuing gratitude for the achievement of suchindividuals.</p><p>This essay will discuss these concepts and their significance forthe survival of our specie.</p><p>See also <a href="#LAND">On...the Land of the Pharaohs.</a></p></ul><hr><h4>On...A Moral "Regulatory" System</h4><ul>	<p>	Attempts to regulate various activities in a society through the	use of the coercive powers of a political state are clearly immoral	in any time frame, and certainly irrational in the long term if not the	short term.  They are also in fact irrational in the short term, but	this is more difficult to realize, as it conflicts with the image	and intent of regulation	</p>		<p>	There is a very simple way of "regulating" things in a society using	several currently-existing mechanisms.  This essay will explain	the principle of these mechanisms, and how they work in practice.	</p></ul><hr><h4>On...Advertising, Editorials and "News."</h4><ul>	<p>	Most people believe that advertising and editorials, and what is	commonly called "news," are three completely different things.	A close examination will reveal they are not.	</p></ul<hr><hr><h4>On...Laissez-Faire City &amp; Concepts of Utopia</h4><ul>	<p>	In primitive societies based on coercion, wherein the quality of	life on an absolute basis continues its inexorable decline until	the problems are recognized and fixed, or the societies and the	volitional specie creating it are destroyed, people yearn for a	solution to their problems in the form of a "utopia."	</p>		<p>	The concept always exists in such primitive societies, but was	given special voice by Thomas More [1478-1535] in 1516 in his	book of the same name.  All known concepts of Utopia would fail,	and for the same reason as all societies based on coercion--that	they fail to take into account the nature of volitional beings.	</p>		<p>	The "Laissez-Faire City" concept recently advertised is as bad or	worse than other previous non-solutions to the problems of primitive,	coercive societies.  The intentions may be good, but we all know	what the road to the place no one wants to go to is paved with.	</p>		<p>	The historical concept of Utopia will be discussed as related to	primitive political societies, and why they did not and cannot work.	A rational concept of "Utopia" will then be discussed.	</p></ul><hr><h4>On...CNN News &amp; the Future of Man</h4><ul>	<p>	Does what we see on CNN News represent the future of the	volitional special on this planet?  What if CNN had existed	several thousand years ago?  Wouldn't we be seeing essentially	the same things we are seeing now?  The Legions of Rome would	be fighting somewhere, either an offensive war in far-off places,	or--as in the case with the Second Punic War--a battle for survival	against attack upon Rome itself.	</p>		<p>	Today we see famines, wars, inflation, depressions.  It is safe to	say, had CNN existed 2,000 years ago, people then would have been	seeing the same thing.  It was going on then, as now, the only	difference being the immediacy of the news.	</p>		<p>	This offers us powerful lessons for our time.  Lessons that have	been available for thousands of year, but no one his understood	the lesson.  We therefore find ourselves reliving history.  Is there	a solution for this problem?</ul><hr><h4>On...Intellectual Baggage and Problem Solution.</h4>	<ul>	<p>	The reason that--after millennia of trying--we have not been	able to solve our societal problems is that we carry too	many misconceptions about history and what it tells us.  We	make great advances in the non-volitional sciences because	we do not accept the status quo and are willing to break out	of the bounds of accepted thinking and "conventional wisdom."	We are willing to review existing theories, make extrapolations	based on this, formulate hypotheses of "what might or could	be,"  And to then test them for correctness or "rightness"	against historical and current events.	</p>		<p>	We then create new and arbitrary definitions, based on the best	available knowledge, for the purpose of explaining our hypothesis and	communicating it to others.   And, if we are creating a new branch	of knowledge, we propose two or more postulates upon which to	base it.	</p>		<p>	The reason we have never made any progress in solving our societal	problems is that this was never done for what is commonly called	the "social sciences."  It "just happened," with the result that we have	a system based on false premises and increasing chaos and	misunderstandings caused by millennia of attempts to repair a	basically unworkable system.	</p></ul><hr noshade><p><b>Note:</b></p><p>Some of these essays have already been written, some of them manyyears ago, with others nearly finished.  They are not being releasedyet as there is the problem of how to protect the property from beingviolated.  An unfortunate but very real artifact of our currentsocietal mechanisms.</p><p>I have released--and will occasionally release others--withoutany protection so that readers have something on which to judgewhether or not to purchase additional essays.</p><p>Part of the reason for the concern is the <b>guarantee</b> I wishto provide. This is that the purchase price of any essay would bereturned upon request, with no reason necessary.  For this, I wouldlike to ensure that such a purchaser would not retain a copy of theessay.  This would be immoral, but certainly not easily preventedwith current technology. In a rational and durable society--thecreation of which is the purpose of <i>The FreedomServer</i><sup>&copy;</sup>--this thought would not even occur.</p><p>Since all knowledge is related, it may happen that one or moretitles and concepts of intended essays will be merged into one title.The explanation of many things is so simple that in principle it maytake few words to explain the problem and the solution, and theresulting essay would <b>appear</b> to be too short to provide valuecommensurate with the cost.  If the value is there, the cost isjustifiable, yet many people may not realize the value they arereceiving.</p><hr noshade><center>[<a href="#TOP">Top of Page</a>]</center><hr noshade><center>&copy; 1995 - The Universal Salvage Corporation<p><i>Specialists in Dying Civilizations</i></p></center><hr noshade><p><b>Contact Information:</b></p><p><a href="mailto:administrator@freedom-server.co">administrator</a></p><hr><p>The URL of this page is:</p><CENTER>&lt;http://www.freedom-server.co.uk/Essays.html&gt; </CENTER><HR NOSHADE></BODY></HTML>
