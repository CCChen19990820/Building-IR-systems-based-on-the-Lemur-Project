<h2><a name="RTFToC1">GRASS SHEARS </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Hand shears, grass trimmers, hand trimmers,
floating blade grass shears, vertical grip hand trimmers, garden
shears (incorrect and misleading)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Scissor-type blades that cut by passing over one
another like household scissors, but the handles are arranged so
they are squeezed in a vertical position, called<i> vertical
squeeze </i>or <i>pump action</i> style. Most handles are plastic
coated. The blades of some new designs can be swiveled so that
they cut in a vertical direction as well as horizontally, and are
Teflon coated. Some new models designed with gripping problems in
mind have a hand-sized trigger grip.</p>

<p>USE: Trimming grass or weeds around trees or structures.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Wear gloves to prevent blisters.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: A comfortable grip is the most important feature
to look for, and the better models have handles that are plastic
or rubber coated. The new designs that swivel or use large
triggers may be easier for an arthritic gardener. Floating top
blade is the sign of a better shear, but the choice is largely
one of personal &quot;feel.&quot;</p>

<p>____________________________________________________________ </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC2">LONG-HANDLED GRASS SHEARS </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Long-handled hand trimmers</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Quite similar to <b>grass shears (above)</b> but
with a long metal handle about a yard long. On some models, two
wheels at the rear of the blades allow these trimmers to be
rolled along the ground and operated from a standing position.</p>

<p>USE: Trimming grass and weeds from a standing position. </p>

<p>USE TIP: Keep blades sharp and wear gloves to prevent
blisters. Clean blades after use.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Check for comfort of grip, above all.
Plastic-covered grips are easier to use. These are particularly
helpful if you have trouble bending and stooping, or even
kneeling, and can even be used from a wheelchair.</p>

<p>____________________________________________________________ </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC3">ROTARY EDGER </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Rotary turf edger, lawn edger</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A pair of hard rubber or plastic wheels attached
to which is a metal wheel with sharp pointed cutting teeth. Made
with a long handle. When the wheels are rolled along the ground,
the movement forces the teeth to cut. This edger works by
cutting, unlike the semicircular, plain <b>edger</b> <b>(Chapter
5)</b>. Also available in a power version, either like a <b>string
trimmer (below) </b>or a small gas-powered lawn mower with a
vertical blade.</p>

<p>USE: Trimming grass and weeds along paths and plant beds and
the like.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Keep wheels cleaned and oiled. </p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Models on which the blade depth can be adjusted
for deep-rooted weeds are more expensive, but not always
necessary.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC4">POWER TRIMMING AND CUTTING TOOLS </a></h2>

<h2><a name="RTFToC5">BATTERY-OPERATED HAND TRIMMERS </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Cordless hand trimmer, electric grass shears,
electric shears</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Plastic-housed motor with two metal blades with
sharp triangular teeth extending horizontally from it, about the
size and shape of an eggbeater. The teeth on the top blade move
over the bottom blade, which is stationary. Uses rechargable
batteries and is cordless.</p>

<p>USE: Designed only for light trimming jobs, such as the grass
around trees, not for heavy weeds or woody plants. Useful for
someone who has difficulty gripping.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Do not try to force these trimmers to do heavier work
than they are designed to do. The blades should be replaced when
they become dull.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Cordless electric trimmers are relatively
inexpensive, at under $50. These trimmers could be helpful for
light trimming or as an aid to someone with difficulty gripping.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC6">BLADE-TYPE POWER TRIMMERS </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Combination edger and trimmer, power edger,
brush cutter</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A variety of blade types have appeared over the
years for this popular item, including a straight piece of metal
similar to a miniature <b>rotary mower (Chapter 8), </b>a double
blade with triangular teeth, similar to the <b>battery-operated
trimmer (above)</b>, or a circular, serrated blade like a
circular saw. The gas or electric motor may be mounted above the
blade or at the end of the handle. They have long metal handles
for operation from a standing position. These trimmers were among
the first power tools introduced.</p>

<p>USE: Heavy lawn trimming work along walls, such as brush or
thick and woody weeds.</p>

<p>USE TIP: The model with the spinning metal blade is capable of
flinging stones and other objects, so it is necessary to wear
protective clothing and goggles when using it. For the same
reason it is a good idea not to use these machines near other
people, especially small ones, or pets. Most of these should be
used with a lunging, chopping motion for larger branches.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Metal blades can cut woody material that the <b>string
trimmers (below)</b> can not. If you are cutting only green weeds
and grass, the string trimmers are better suited to the job and
safer to use.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC7">POWER HEDGE SHEARS </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Power shears, garden trimmers</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Two back-to-back sets of blades about 2 to 3'
long with many large, moving, pointed teeth, with a gas or
electric motor and handle. Resembles the beak of a swordfish.
Normally cuts from both sides.</p>

<p>USE: Trimming hedges with branches up to 1/4&quot; thick,
though some professional models will cut up to 1/2&quot; thick.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Trim the top of the hedge so it is narrower than the
bottom, allowing sunlight to reach the bottom branches. Exercise
caution when working with an electric trimmer not to cut the
power cord.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Electric trimmers are lighter and quieter to use
than gasoline powered ones but are limited by the length of the
cord. Look for double insulated, UL-approved makes. Look also for
adjustable handle, for better balance when cutting in different
positions. Blades may be made from stainless steel or forged
steel, but while stainless steel is slightly better than forged
steel, the advantage is so slight that the cost difference makes
forged steel a better buy. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC8">STRING TRIMMER </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Rotary trimmer, nylon string trimmer, grass
trimmer, weed trimmer, flexible line grass trimmer, line trimmer</p>

<p>POPULAR BRAND NAMES: Weed Eater, Weed Wacker, Weed Wizard </p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A long-handled tool, either straight or slightly
curved, with one, two, or three heavy nylon monofilament strings
on a spool that are spun at high speed by an electric (regular or
battery-operated) or 2-cycle gas engine. The strings act as a
blade. Cut sizes range from 8&quot; to 16.&quot; The heavier-duty
models are usually gas powered and have straight shafts. The cord
is reeled out as it becomes frayed or broken, either by a button
on the handle (&quot;push button feed&quot;) or by bumping the
head on the ground (&quot;bump feed&quot;). String trimmers are a
revolutionary form of power trimming created in l974 by George
Ballas. <b>[include story of invention?] </b>Some gas-powered
models can also take a metal saw-tooth blade for heavy brush
cutting. Trimmer line is available by itself in various
thicknesses from .040 to .130 inches and in lengths from 40 to
over 1,000 feet (that's just a 1 pound box of the thinnest line).
Curved shafts are found on most light-duty models.</p>

<p>A recent variation is a nylon trimmer that mows as well as
trims. This is a traditional-looking gasoline powered mower with
the motor mounted behind the nylon reel and between to large
wheels. This &quot;nylon mower&quot; may in time replace the
classic rotary mower. </p>

<p>USE: Cutting weeds and long grass but not woody material.
Particularly good for trimming near buildings, trees and other
solid structures in the garden. Some models double as edgers when
turned on their sides; others are designed specifically as
edgers. Cuts a path from 7 to 20 inches wide, depending on the
model. </p>

<p>USE TIP: While generally safer to use than metal blade
trimmers, nylon cord trimmers are not without hazard. The nylon
cord can sling stones and debris, so appropriate clothing, heavy
boots, and goggles should be worn, and no pets or other other
people should be in the area. Some manufacturers even offer shin
guards. Though string trimmers do less damage to trees than ones
with metal blades, they are still capable of knocking off tree
bark or damaging flowers and shrubs through carelessness. A
plastic or metal <b>tree guard</b> <b>(Chapter 9) </b>is
recommended on young trees. Don't try to work a multiple-line
trimmer with only one line.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: There is a large choice of makes and models on the
market today. The tool should feel comforable to use: Check the
handle length, controls, and overall feel, and above all, the
balance. Models with the engine mounted on the upper end of the
handle are slightly better balanced, and this position keeps the
engine clean; straight shafts are more easily handled and a bit
more powerful and durable. Models with more than one
&quot;whip&quot; have a larger cutting capacity. A built-in
clutch that prevents the cord from turning when the motor idles
is an important safety feature. Look for models with &quot;bump
feed,&quot; which means that the head of the tool is simply
bumped on the ground to release more cord while the motor remains
on. Other models require that you shut them off in order to hand
feed new cord. &quot;Automatic release&quot; models often release
more than you might need, wasting cord. Electric trimmers are
generally preferable to gasoline ones if your area is not so
large, as they are so much more quieter and vibrate less. A 20 to
25cc gas engine is usually sufficient for most lawns and gardens;
electric models have a narrow range of 1/8 to about 3/4
horsepower. This is fast becoming considered a basic homeowner
tool.</p>

<p>___________________________________________________________ </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC9">CHAIN SAW </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: </p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Gas or electric powered saw with a wide, 10 to
20&quot; long blade called a guide bar surrounded by a continuous
cutting chain that revolves around its edge. Gasoline-powered
saws tend to be heavier duty and are available in a wide range of
sizes and capabilities, from those for home use to <i>production </i>models
used in professional logging operations. Gas engines are rated by
displacement (measured in cubic inches, running from about 1.6 to
an enormous 8.3), with the higher numbers indicating more power.
Chain saws have four types of teeth: chipper (most common),
chisel (typical on professional models), semi-chisel (a good
combiniation), and automatic sharpening (for specially equipped
saws). Replacement guide bars are available, as are chains.</p>

<p><i>Electric</i>chain saws are powered by electric motors. They
are quiet, do not use volatile fuels, are easy to start, and emit
no exhaust fumes. </p>

<p><i>Gasoline</i>chain saws are powered by gasoline engines. The
range in size is from small and light weight to the large heavy
logger machines. Pull-cord or electronic push-button ignition.</p>

<p>USE: Heavy pruning, felling unwanted or overgrown trees, and
for cutting up firewood. The latter is the most common use of
chainsaws among homeowners. </p>

<p>USE TIP: This is one of the most dangerous tools you might
own, so be absolutely sure to use it correctly and carefully.
Double-check manufacturer's instructions. The contact point of
the blade and the tree or log should be right up near the
motor—otherwise the moving chain might pull you and the saw into
the tree, causing you serious injury. Be especially careful when
felling a tree: make sure the saw does not bind in the cut, and
get back when the cut goes through. Be sure to keep the chain
tension properly adjusted. Keep your blade sharp; <i>saw
sharpener kits</i> are available. </p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Be sure to consider your needs carefully before
buying a chain saw. A small bargain saw that can not stand up to
the work is no bargain in the end, especially the
bottom-of-the-line electric ones. A good electric chain saw that
can do the job well should cost as much as a comparable gasoline
one. A chain brake that stops the saw automatically should it
become bound (or if your hand hits it) is a feature definitely
worth paying for, but it is unfortunately not usually found on
the smaller models. Look for a toothed cutting guide where the
blade meets the motor on the larger chain saws and better small
ones. This is used to anchor and stablize the saw at the cut.
Look also for solid-state ignition, a tip guard, anti-vibration
devices, an automatic oiler, a nose sprocket (to reduce friction
at the tip), and a compression release button, which makes for
easier starting of gas models. The grip and oil button should be
comfortable to you; the location of the oil button is of
particular concern to left-handed people, as it is often designed
to be pressed with the operator's right thumb. Electric chain
saws are fine if you are no further from an electrical source
than 150 feet; the advantage of gasoline saws lies in their
portability and power, but they are noisy and fuel is volatile.
They are the way to go, however, if you have lots of firewood to
cut.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC1">MAINTENANCE TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT </a></h2>

<h2><a name="RTFToC2">ABOUT GENERAL MAINTENANCE TOOLS AND
EQUIPMENT </a></h2>

<p>This is one area of the garden center where there is plenty of
overlap, so here is a broadly inclusive category for lawn and
garden items. Although it could be argued that shovels (Chapter
5) can just as easily be used for maintenance as for planting,
this is how these items are usually arranged.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC3">WATERING EQUIPMENT </a></h2>

<h2><a name="RTFToC4">ABOUT WATERING EQUIPMENT: </a></h2>

<p>Every garden, large or small, needs to be watered. While this
is a simple and usually relatively passive task, figuring out
your needs can be daunting. Garden centers sell a confusing
variety of watering equipment and accessories (collectively known
as <i>watering goods</i>), but basically all you need is a good
hose, a watering can, a good nozzle, and if your space demands
it, a sprinkler. The many other watering accessories can be
purchased as you discover a special need for them. </p>

<p>Watering should be done on a regular and careful basis. Most
gardens (especially a vegetable garden) require at least 1 inch
of water a week. However, too little water is often worse than
none at all, because shallow watering causes plants to be
shallow-rooted, leaving you with plants which will not survive
periods of drought. <u>When</u> you water can be as important as <u>how
much</u> you water, since fungal infections are spread by spores
that develop in the presence of moisture and in the absence of
light—so it is best not to water at dusk or at night. Plants
that are particularly susceptible to fungal problems (such as
roses, lilacs, zinnias, and phlox) should be carefully watered at
soil level, with care not to wet the foliage. It is wise to
choose watering accessories that can help you garden with this
type of concern in mind.</p>

<p>Plumbing fittings, including garden hose accessories, are
described in terms of <i>male</i> and <i>female</i>, which refers
to the screw threads. Female threads are on the inside, while
male threads are on the outside. Female threaded parts seem
bigger because they actually house the threads, while male
threads seem smaller because all that is present is the threads.
Another way to remember which is which to remind yourself that
male threads <i>protrude</i>, and go into other fittings (like
nozzles), while female threads <i>receive</i> other fittings.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC5">WATERING CAN </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Sprinkling can</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Plastic or metal cans of a wide range of sizes
(from 2 pints to 2 gallons) with a spout on one end and a handle
on the other. The spout end is usually tipped with a round or
oval sprinkling head with many small holes, known as a <i>rose</i>,
which can point either up or down; it either screws or slides on.
<i>Long-reach watering cans</i> have spouts as long as 36&quot;.
A variation on this style is a large box-like container with a
short, flexible hose. Handles and roses are sometimes made of
brass.</p>

<p>USE: Light watering, such as when setting out transplants or
watering-in seeds. Also useful for applying liquid fertilizers.
An oval rose that points up provides a gentle sprinkle for
delicate seedlings and plants; it points down for other watering.
A round rose that faces forward is an all-purpose head for
watering established plants. A variation made for hanging plants,
called <i>hanging plant waterers</i>, is noted below. <i>Watering
boxes</i> with long tubing are for watering difficult to reach
plants. <i>Long-reach cans</i> are useful in greenhouses, wide
beds, or wherever plants are a bit hard to reach, or wherever you
want to avoid watering the foliage and just get to the roots with
fine spray.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Metal cans, particularly those made of galvanized
metal, should be dry when stored, as most eventually corrode if
stored with water in them. Watering cans should not be used for
applying any kind of pesticides--they should be used with water
and fertilizer only. Plastic cans in particular might absorb any
toxic chemical put in them. Or if you must apply pesticide this
way, designate one watering can just for that purpose. The
capacity of English cans is noted in Imperial gallons, which are
about 1 pint larger than ours. Drain metal cans completely after
use to reduce corrosion. Smaller ones are easier to use for hard
to reach plants, especially those that are high. Boxes are easily
stored due to their efficient shape.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Plastic watering cans are usually cheaper than
metal ones, and do the job well. Watering cans made from heavy
gauge galvanized steel (the best are treated with zinc chromate),
which last very well when cared for, have been around for more
than 50 years and are still the most popular. Check to see if the
seams are reinforced. Rose heads, especially brass ones, that
screw on can be replaced with different types, and are therefore
more desirable. Cans with long spouts tend to be better balanced;
a cross-piece helps when carrying a full load. Brass and copper
watering cans are very durable when they are kept clean and dry
during storage, but they are much more expensive. They are
popular for aesthetic reasons alone. Always look for a
well-balanced can that has a solid spout, the end of which should
be at a higher point than the water level in order to keep from
spilling. A collar around the top opening is further insurance
against spilling. Unless you have only one or two plants to
water, get something that holds at least a couple of quarts.
Remember that big cans may not fit under your faucet for filling,
so measure first, and that large cans are quite heavy when
filled. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC6">HANGING PLANT WATERER </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Quart or half-gallon plastic bottle with a
yard-long small J-shaped tube. Either of two types: one that you
squeeze, or one that has a sliding pump grip, like a trombone.</p>

<p>USE: Watering and fertilizing hanging plants up to 9' high.
Excellent for wheelchair gardeners. </p>

<p>USE TIPS: Practice over a sink to see how much water comes out
with a squeeze, or else you may find yourself taking an impromptu
shower.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Inexpensive, handy item.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC7">GARDEN HOSE </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Plastic, rubber, nylon, or vinyl flexible tubing
1/2&quot;, 5/8&quot;, or 3/4&quot; in diameter, usually available
in 25, 50 or 75' lengths. Most often green in color, but also
found in red or black. Most are made of several plys of materials
and many include an integrated reinforcing mesh. Hoses are rated
by the amount of pressure required to burst them, indicated in
pounds per square inch (psi). Ratings run from 50 to 600 psi,
with the higher rating indicating a better hose. Lengths of hose
can be joined together with threaded brass, steel, or plastic
couplings that screw into each other. Two-ply vinyl hoses are
sold which are light weight and consist of a vinyl core with an
additional outer vinyl layer. Those with plastic couplings may
feature a grip design that makes tightening and loosening the
connection easier by providing a flange to push with your thumb.
A <i>flat hose</i> is made of a vinyl or other plastic weave that
collapses when empty and can be reeled up in a more compact space
than a regular hose. A miniature version for use with house
plants, called a <i>house hose,</i> is designed to be hooked up
to the kitchen sink faucet (in place of the aerator) and has a
trigger at the foot-long wand end.</p>

<p>USE: Carrying water throughout the garden.</p>

<p>USE TIP: It is a good practice to roll up hoses when not in
use, because leaving them out exposes them to the deteriorating
rays of the sun. Be careful not to damage plants when dragging
the hose through the garden; stakes or <b>hose guides (below) </b>help
prevent this. And don't bang the couplings against stone, or
you'll have some leaks.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Price determines the quality when purchasing
garden hoses, and you should buy the best quality possible; 500
lb burst strength is a main criteria for the best. Hoses with
larger diameters deliver more water faster to the garden, making
5/8&quot; diameter hoses a good buy. As most leaks occur at the
couplings, look for good, crush-resistant couplings of heavy duty
cast brass. Only the best quality vinyl is both flexible,
kink-resistant, and durable. The best rubber or vinyl hoses are
reinforced with a synthetic mesh layer, or ply. The higher the
number of plys to the hose, the better the quality; 4 is tops,
though 3 is good if the mesh is thick. Note that nylon and vinyl
are more sensitive to the sun, and deteriorate after much
exposure. They generally have lower pressure capacity ratings
than rubber hoses; some are rated as low as 50psi, which
indicates a hose of very low quality. Two-ply vinyl hoses are
light weight and are some of the cheapest on the market, but they
kink easily and are not very pliable, making them a very annoying
thing to have to use. They are not worth the money saved. In all
hoses, look for ones supplied with a 4&quot; plastic <i>hose
collar</i> to keep it from kinking at the faucet, or buy one as
an accessory. At least one manufacturer offers a lifetime
guarantee, which is hard to beat. Rubber hoses are more expensive
and heavier, but they are more durable, resisting sun, cold
weather, and kinks, and are generaly considered the best--quite
worth the extra expense. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC8">___________________________________________________________HOSE
REPAIR ACCESSORIES </a></h2>

<p>TYPES:</p>

<p><i>Couplings</i></p>

<p><i>Tape</i></p>

<p><i>Patch kits</i></p>

<p><i>Washers</i></p>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS:</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A variety of items are available to replace or
repair most parts of garden hoses. </p>

<p><i>Couplings: </i>Sets of male or female threads which are
secured to a hose end with two screws, or an expanded collar (<i>clincher</i>
coupling) which is pinched down with pliers in order to attach
two lengths to one another after a damaged section is cut away
(male and female), to a nozzle (male), or to a faucet (female).
Another, top quality kind is made of brass and inserted into the
cut end of the hose. A metal ring with a clamp for tightening is
then screwed down upon it. A specialized version of a coupling,
called <i>menders, </i>have clamps on both ends and are used for
patching two pieces of hose together where a leaky section has
been cut out, and can be the clinch or the <i>clamp</i> type
(sometime called the <i>clam shell </i>type), or a new
quick-connect style.</p>

<p><i>Tape: </i>Plastic tape with strong adhesive for temporary
repairs of small leaks.</p>

<p><i>Patch kits: </i>Small package containing rubber patch
material and cement for patching pinholes.</p>

<p><i>Washers: </i>Small package of flat donut-shaped rubber
items which fit inside the hose fitting and help seal the
connection made when the parts are screwed together.</p>

<p>USE: Replacing or repairing damaged hose parts.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Replace washers often, as they tend to wear out. It
is a good idea to keep a few on a small wire attached to a
spigot. Clincher-type couplings need to be pinched down very
carefully. The clamp types are easier to use.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: A good quality hose can be repaired easily and for
less money than is required to replace it. None of the
replacement coupling parts is very expensive, and sturdy,
top-quality plastic may work as well as solid brass parts.
Experiment to find out which replacement parts are easiest for
you to use. Keep lots of washers on hand for quick repairs.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC9">QUICK-CONNECT HOSE SYSTEM </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Snap-together watering system, Gardena system,
snap adapters</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Plastic devices based on a small connector which
snaps onto garden hoses or accessories (like sprinklers) quite
easily. A built-in valve automatically shuts off water flow when
accessories are removed. Invented in Germany a number of years
ago by Gardena, a West German company, there are now quite a few
manufacturers with their own similar products. Systems include
adapters for attachment to conventional accessories, taps or
faucets, more hose, two other hoses (Y-coupler), 4-tap
distributor, and other accessories of the same manufacturer, such
as sprinklers and nozzles--the entire range of hose accessories.
It can also serve as the basis for an entire <b>drip irrigation
system (below). </b></p>

<p>USE: Quick connection of hose accessories without force or
having to turn off the water at the faucet.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: This is an inexpensive item and makes for a very
easy-to-use system. Look for shock-resistant plastic that won't
break if you step on it accidentally.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC10">SHUT-OFF VALVE </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Shutoff coupling, hose accessory</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Brass, zinc, or plastic accessory that screws
into female hose couplings and contains a small twist piece. One
particular make is a short, rubber nozzle that shuts off whenever
it is dropped onto the ground, called a <i>water miser.</i></p>

<p>USE: Allows you to stop the water flow without having to go
back to the spigot when you want to change nozzles or other
accessories. &quot;Y&quot; connectors allow you to run two
separate hoses from a single water source, controlling the water
flow in one of both of the attached hoses independently of one
another.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Shut-off valves save time and labor when they are
attached between hoses that are connected together. When
connected to the spigot, though, shut-off valves are no easier to
use than turning the faucet knob.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Brass is usually the best quality and most
durable. If you have extremely good water pressure, plastic may
not be sturdy enough.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC11">DOUBLE HOSE SHUTOFF </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Y-connector, 2-way hose shut-off, dual shutoff
coupling, siamese shutoff, Two - or 2-hose adapter, twin
shut-off, double hose shutoff, siamese coupling with shutoffs</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Brass, zinc, or plastic accessory that screws
onto a male-threaded faucet and into two female hose couplings;
contains two shut-off valves in each leg of the &quot;Y&quot;
each , similar to the above single coupling.</p>

<p>USE: Separate control of two hoses from one faucet.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Get the best, heavy-duty quality make you can
find. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC1">GOOSENECK COUPLING </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Gooseneck hose swivel connector, gooseneck
connector</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Brass coupling with female threads on one end and
male on the other, which is at a 45<sup>0</sup> angle and, in
most brands, swivels. Simply an extension of a spigot, but one
that puts the threads on an angle and allows it to move with the
hose.</p>

<p>USE: Allows for easier connection of a hose and may save on
hose wear at the spigot.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC2">HOSE SAVER </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Short length of hose wrapped in heavy steel
spring, with couplings on either end. Attaches to faucet and hose
end.</p>

<p>USE: Prevents kinking of hose at faucet by maintaining a
gentle bend.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Excellent accessory that is often part of newer
hoses, sometimes in an all-plastic version.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC3">HOSE GUIDES </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Metal or wooden rods, which may be plain or
encircled by a large roller or made of three small rollers,
designed to be inserted into the ground. Some models have a hook
or curved top that prevents the hose from riding up and over the
guide. Others are quite ornamental, with sculpted leaf tops and
the like.</p>

<p>USE: When placed in the ground near plant beds and plants,
prevents the hose from being pulled over the bed and damaging
plants as it is dragged through the garden.</p>

<p>USE TIP: </p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Though excellent hose guides are sold in garden
centers, they can also be easily made by the gardener. Strong
bamboo stakes or metal rods driven in the ground can suffice. </p>

<p>________________________________________________________ </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC4">HOSE REEL </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS:</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Large spool, or reel, that is either attached to
a wall or is part of a cart with two wheels. The <i>hose reel
cart</i> , or <i>trolley, </i>allows you to move the hose from
place to place in the yards. Capacity is about150' of 5/8&quot;
hose, more of smaller hoses. &quot;Estate&quot; models hold up to
400' and have four wheels, like a wagon; other, fancy models have
an accessory storage tray for nozzles and couplings. Reel carts
usually have a 4 to 6' leader hose that attaches to the water
supply. Made of galvanized or enameled steel, or heavy plastic,
or a combination of materials. There are few alternative designs,
though attractive ceramic pots with an interior cone (<i>hose
pots</i>) can be found; the hose is coiled within.</p>

<p>USE: Storage of hoses in a coiled position off the ground and
out of the sun (presuming they are installed under shelter),
avoiding sun damage as well as garden tripping hazards. In the
case of the cart type, convenient transport of a heavy hose to
distant gardens and out of sight storage.</p>

<p>USE TIP: When reeling in the hose, be sure that it does not
kink. Install it out of the sun's reach. Cart type may offer some
relief to gardeners who do not have the strength or ability to
carry a heavy coil around the garden. </p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Buy a reel that is large enough for the length of
hose you wish to store. Cart-type hose reels are complicated and
are available in a range of styles and qualities; buy the
sturdiest you can afford. Poorly constructed hose reel carts do
not last long and often bend in normal use. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC5">HOSE HANGER </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS:</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Basically a large hook or double hook with a
wide, paritally curved support designed to be attached to a wall,
though there is a wide variety of models available. Galvanized,
epoxy-coated, or painted metal as well as plastic. Capacity
ranges from 50' to 150.' </p>

<p>USE: Garden hose storage. The hose is coiled over the hook.
The curved support holds the hose in a coil form instead of
pinching it, as a simple hook would do.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Ideal for winter storage in a garage or shed.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Make sure you get a model sturdy enough to support
the weight of your hose.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC6">NOZZLES</a></h2>

<p>TYPES: </p>

<p><i>Twist-type</i></p>

<p><i>Pistol grip</i></p>

<p><i>Cleaning</i></p>

<p><i>Water Breaker</i><sup><i>TM</i></sup></p>

<p><i>Fogger</i></p>

<p><i>Seedling</i></p>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: </p>

<p><i>Twist-type: </i>Spray, straight</p>

<p><i>Pistol grip: </i>Spray gun, trigger</p>

<p><i>Cleaning: </i>Sweeping, sweeper, power</p>

<p><i>Fogger: </i>Fogg-It (brand name), misting head, fog nozzle</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Hand-sized plastic or metal devices that attach
to the male end of a hose (the smaller end, with external
threads). Various settings control the shape and force of the
spray or stop the water altogether; many ingenious devices are
available which can be roughly grouped into the following
categories.</p>

<p><i>Twist-type:</i> Sraight shaft made of metal or plastic.
Spray is controlled by twisting the shaft. Most common kind.</p>

<p><i>Pistol-grip nozzle:</i><b> </b>Water is turned on or off by
squeezing or releasing a trigger. In most models, the spray is
adjusted by screwing a knob at the top of the trigger which
controls how far the trigger can be compressed when it is
squeezed. Others have a twist- type spray head that is adjusted
by twisting the shaft of the head. A modified version, called a <i>trigger
nozzle</i>, looks like a gun and is very comfortable to use.</p>

<p><i>Cleaning: </i>Not adjustable. A small aperture causes water
to spurt out with extreme force. </p>

<p><i>Water Breaker</i><sup><i>TM: </i></sup>Large round,
aluminum or plastic nozzle with many small holes, like a kithen
sink aerator. Reduces a full volume of water to a soft, rainlike
spray without increasing pressure. Smaller ones are made for low
pressure sources. A trademark (The Dramm Company) that aptly
describes what it does to water: it breaks it up into a fine,
gentle spray.</p>

<p><i>Fogger: </i>Finely machined brass nozzle with three small
holes that create a fine mist. Four degrees of spray fineness
available.</p>

<p><i>Seedling: </i>Finely machined, cadmium-plated brass nozzle
with one small hole that produces an extra fine mist.</p>

<p>USE: Controlling the shape, volume, and force of the water
coming out of a hose.</p>

<p><i>Cleaning: </i>High-pressure tools intended to be used for
cleaning patios, driveways, or sidewalks, and are not at all
suitable for watering plants or gardens.</p>

<p><i>Twist-type:</i> Can be set at a particular spray pattern
and left on, such as when watering beds or transplants.</p>

<p><i>Pistol grip: </i>Excellent for quick spray jobs where spray
consistency is not important and where the quick on-and-off
action is needed. </p>

<p><i>Water Breakers</i><sup><i>TM : </i></sup>Normal watering of
plants, particularly in greenhouses. Popular with professional
growers.</p>

<p><i>Fogger: </i>Watering delicate flowers such as orchids, or
wilting plants.</p>

<p><i>Seedling: </i>Watering delicate seedlings.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Nozzles are helpful hose attachments for washing off
foliage or when light watering is required for seedlings and
transplants. Hand-watering a lawn with a hose and nozzle is
wrong, though; a sprinkler is the best way to achieve the 1&quot;
of water necessary to avoid shallow watering.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: The best nozzles are made of solid brass, which
can last a lifetime. Less expensive nozzles are made of plastic
or brass-plated zinc, which can rust where scratched, and are not
as sturdy, although some recent designs of top-quality, thick
platic are very good. Cleaning nozzles are usually an unnecessary
investment, as the other, adjustable nozzles can produce a spray
almost as hard. It is not unwise to have both the twist and the
pistol type of nozzles on hand. Look for pistol types that can be
set to hold a particular spray pattern.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC7">WATER WAND </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Spray wand, rain wand, garden soft spray, soft
spray wand, soft sprayer, hose extender, hose extension,
extension wand, showerhead nozzle, shower arm, water breaker,
trigger-release lance, lance</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Watering and fertilizing device made of a
lightweight metal pipe, from 1-1/2 to about 3 feet long, that
attaches to the end of a hose. On one end is a type of nozzle or
sprayhead (or &quot;rose&quot;), and on the other is a grip with
some type of water shut-off valve, often a pistol grip. Those
designed for fertilizing as well as watering contain a clear
plastic chamber on the grip end which delivers fertilizer diluted
with the water that flows through the wand. Fertilizer is usually
supplied by a solid <i>fertilizer tablet</i>, sold for a
particular type of plant. Many water wands, such as the Gardena
Watering System<sup>, </sup>have a variety of attachments that
control the type of spray. The shortest models--16&quot;--may be
called <i>Patio plant wands.</i></p>

<p>USE: Watering hard-to-reach bed plants at soil level; applying
foliar fertilizers.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Keep the holes in the sprayheads clean and unclogged.
Drain water from the wand when storing. Change rubber washers in
the connectors frequently to prevent leaks.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: This is one gardening device where plastic does
not signal poor quality; price is often a good guide.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC8">FAN HEAD SPRAYER </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Fan sprayer, fan spray, flaring rose</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Metal or plastic nozzle, wide and triangular in
shape. They have a very wide spray head with many small holes
with a narrow, threaded end which attaches to a hose. Some models
have spikes attached which allows them to be left in a particular
area for deeper soaking, like a stationary sprinkler. </p>

<p>USE: Delivering a large quantity of water in a gentle spray.
Ideal devices for watering in seeds and seedlings as well as
roses and other delicate flowers.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Be sure that the area is well-soaked when watering in
seedlings; shallow watering encourages transplants to be
shallow-rooted. </p>

<p>BUYING TIP: These are inexpensive devices, but slightly more
expensive ones with built-in valves that shut the water on and
off are easier to use. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC9">BUBBLER</a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Soaker, irrigator, bubble soaker</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Rounded, fist-sized nozzle which mixes air with
water that is dispersed with a gentle flow.</p>

<p>USE: Watering trees and large plants one spot at a time. The
bubbler is left on the ground wherever the water is needed.</p>

<p>___________________________________________________________ </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC10">SPRINKLERS</a></h2>

<p>TYPES:</p>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: </p>

<p><i>Impulse: </i>Pulsating, pulsator, pulse</p>

<p><i>Oscillating: </i>Oscillator</p>

<p><i>Revolving:</i> Whirling, whirling head, rotating </p>

<p><i>Stationary:</i> Fixed, static</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Metal or plastic devices that attach to the end
of a water hose and disperse a gentle spray of water over the
garden or lawn. There is a wide array of types and models, rated
by the square feet or dimensions of the area they can water, such
as 2,600 square feet, or a diameter of 30' to 80'. </p>

<p><i>Impulse: </i>A small nozzle shoots water straight out,
which is then deflected by a spring-loaded arm. The arm bounces
back and forth, breaking up the stream of water into droplets and
moving the sprinkler head slightly each time. The radius can be
adjusted to cover full or partial circles up to 100 feet in
diameter--well over 5,000 squre feet. Designed to be staked into
the ground, whether at ground level or on a stand as much as 6'
high. Mechanism made of brass, bronze, plastic, and stainless
steel; base of same or plastic, and is a stake, a ring, or a
platform base. <i>Rainbird</i> is the most common brand used by
professionals, who sometimes use this brand name as if it were a
generic term. </p>

<p><i>Oscillating:</i> Curved sprayhead tube, 8&quot; to 20&quot;
long, which oscillates slowly from side to side as it is driven
by water power. May have a built-in timer for automatic shut-off,
and a stationery setting. Typically waters from 2,600 to 3,600
square feet (such as 55' x 66').</p>

<p><i>Pop-Up:</i> Small impulse or stationary sprinkler head
inside a plastic or metal cone which is designed to be
permanently buried in the lawn surface. Water pressure pops the
head up over the surface a few inches. Part of a permanent
built-in lawn watering system.</p>

<p><i>Revolving: </i>Two or four arms, parallel to the ground,
that revolve and disperse water through nozzles at the tips of
the arms. Most have simple bases and must be moved from area to
area of the garden; some have spikes of various heights up to 4'.
Most models can water a circle (some can do a square) up to about
50' in diameter (and down to a few feet, if you keep the water
pressure low). <i>Traveling sprinklers</i>, revolving sprinkers
on a wheeled base, have water-powered motors that move the
sprinkler along as it waters, either following the hose pattern
laid out and coiling up the hose as they go (<i>wind-up type</i>)
or dragging the hose behind them (<i>tractor type</i>). These can
water areas as large as 20,000 square feet. </p>

<p><i>Stationary: </i>No moving parts; the simplest model. There
are some that resemble the rose heads found on the spouts of <b>watering
cans (above)</b>, called, if they protrude a bit, a <i>turret
sprinkler,</i><b> </b>or showerhead-like <i>ring sprinklers; </i>others
are simple devices that merely deflect the water coming out of a
hose and have a 6&quot; metal spike for staking in the ground,
and may be called a <i>spike sprinkler </i>(some spikes have
steps for pushing them into the ground with your foot). The
simplest models are either a 3-1/2 inch diameter cast iron piece
with a small hole in its top, or a spray head made of two circles
with eyelets for spiking the sprinkler in place, called a <i>twin
dome, double eyelet, </i>or <i>twin spot</i> sprinkler. These all
can water an area from a few feet to 30 feet in diameter and in
square or rectangular patterns, depending both on their design
and on the water pressure.</p>

<p>USE: Watering lawns. Much better than hand-held nozzles, but
not as efficient as soaker hoses or underground systems. With the
wide variety of sprinklers on the market, it is easy to find one
which sends out water in the same shape as the area to be
watered. Stationary sprinklers are for the smallest areas.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Sprinklers should be drained of water (or as much as
can be drained) and stored in areas that do not freeze. Holes
should be cleaned regularly to prevent clogging and assure an
even spray. Adjust the volume of water that your sprinkler puts
out to that which the soil can absorb easily. If it is delivered
in too high a volume, much is not absorbed and the excess just
runs off. On the other hand, too little water coming from the
sprinkler just means that it takes longer to water the garden.
Buy a rain gauge specifically designed for this or place a large
open can, like a coffee can, in the range of the sprinkler as a
measuring guide, and try to give your garden or lawn 1 inch of
water per week. Be careful not to water foliage of plants
susceptible to fungal problems. </p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: The better sprinklers are made of brass and
stainless steel, while the cheaper plastic sprinklers are not as
durable. Traveling sprinklers (revolving type) are good for
people who are unable to move the sprinkler around the lawn as
needed or are not going to be present to do their own watering.
However, they are among the more expensive models on the market.
Some traveling sprinklers even shut off when the job is done.
With oscillating sprinklers, look for those that have brass
nozzles that screw into the holes along the oscillating tube.
They can be easily cleaned, and replaced if they break; the end
plug should be removable for cleaning, too. And they should have
a filter to prevent clogging. Cheaper oscillating sprinklers
hesitate at the extreme of each side, putting excess water down
and causing puddles to form; make sure you get a model that is
engineered to avoid this. The impulse type is the one most often
used by professional gardeners. Look for models with many points
of adjustment, such as a baffle plate to limit height and part
circle operation. Know the measurements of the areas you wish to
water before buying--some can cover many thousands of square
feet. If need be, look for one with an adjustable pattern. Try to
find sprinklers which use as little water as possible, called <i>low
gallonage.</i></p>

<hr size="4">

<h2><a name="RTFToC1">HOSE GRABBER </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Simple loop of heavy gauge steel wire which is
stuck into the ground; loop is a double ring which springs apart
to hold a hose by tension.</p>

<p>USE: Holds nozzle end of a hose in a position for spraying one
spot you wish to soak, such as a newly planted shrub. Easily set
up and removed.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC2">WATER CONTROLLER </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Water timer, water computer, water meter</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Small plastic box containing a meter which
measures the volume of water flowing through, or the amount of
time faucet is open. Designed to be attached to a faucet with a
female coupling end and to a hose with a male coupling end.
Depending on the model, contains electronic or mechanical dials
and indicators of settings. </p>

<p>USE: Automatic watering. Settings control turning on and
shutting off of water at pre-determined times and/or volumes.
Particularly useful for people who travel often. Electronic
models can be set for multiple tasks over a long period of time;
mechanical models are more like glorified oven timers, and can
only be set at the time of each watering to shut off
automatically, usually within a range of 2 hours.</p>

<p>USE TIP: The accuracy of a water meter is easily affected, so
check the device by using buckets or a <b>rain gauge (below)</b>.
The type of sprinkler you use may also affect the accuracy of the
water meter settings. It is a good idea to get a <i>moisture
sensor</i> as well, to prevent watering on rainy days.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Better water meters have a bypass or overide
setting that allows you to set them for a continuous flow for
manual watering, or to stop it on rainy days. Top models should
have an <i>anithammer </i>device that prevents <i>hammering</i>
(the knocking or rattling of pipes that occurs when water is
suddenly shut off) which can damage your pipes.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC3">RAIN GAUGE </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Plastic or metal cylinder with measurement
markings along the side. Some types have a colored ball that
floats inside. Made to be attached to a fencepost or a stake away
from buildings. A smaller version with a stake is made for
measuring sprinkler output--it is easy to move from location to
location.</p>

<p>USE: Measuring the amount of rainfall or sprinkling water on a
garden, particularly over a period of time, like a week. Bright
floats allow you to read them from afar.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Make sure you position the gauge for the most
accurate reading. Remove during cold weather when water might
freeze and damage the gauge. Keep it clean of insects and debris.
Determine the goal of water per week that you need, such as one
inch, and add what the rain doesn't supply. </p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: The most accurate guages have tiny calibrations
and small capacities, at least at the bottom, and may be tapered
for this purpose.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC4">RAIN DRAIN </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Rain spout lawn protector, downspout drain,
downspout control</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Heavy-duty vinyl tube with many small holes that
is installed, coiled up, at the foot of downspouts (or drains, or
leaders), the vertical pipe which leads down from gutters.
Recoils automatically when rain has stopped. Similar item is a
permanent, stone, plastic, or plastic filled with water triangle <i>splashblock</i>
about 28&quot; long, but it doesn't unroll. </p>

<p>USE: Rainwater forces the device to unroll and is sprinkled
over the lawn instead of gushing out and eroding it.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC5">SOAKER HOSE </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Soil soaker, leaky pipe system, porous pipe,
weeping watering system, drip hose, oozer</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A hose that contains thousand of small holes or
is made of porous material so that water seeps out of it along
its length rather than just at the end, as with a conventional
garden hose. Sort of a hose that &quot;leaks&quot; over its
entire length. The first types of soaker hoses were made from
canvas, and can still be found in some garden centers. Others are
made from plastic with small holes along one side, while some of
the newer models are made from porous foam, vinyl, or rubber
(ofter recycled rubber). Designed to be buried as deep as
14&quot; or laid in a garden bed, and can be left there
indefinitely--freezing should not bother it. 25' to 500' lengths.
Accessories include <i>feeder sets </i>and <i>flow regulators. </i>Should
be rated in number of gallons per hour per foot. A similar
product is a two- or three-tubed flat garden hose with small
holes thoughout one side, sometimes called a <i>sprinkler hose </i>or
a <i>sprinkler soaker hose.</i></p>

<p>USE: Even, gentle watering of plants that insures that the
root area receives the most water. Watering with a soaker hose is
healthier for most plants as it avoids the problem of spreading
fungal diseases caused by wet foliage. It also makes better use
of water, as there is less runoff--it just seeps into the ground.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Adjust the water pressure to avoid bursting the hose.
If you are using a buried soaker hose, wrap the open end with a
plastic bag. This prevents dirt from clogging up the hose. If you
are using a flat soaker hose with holes on one side, face the
holes toward the ground to avoid wetting foliage.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: A good quality soaker hose may cost more, but
lasts longer. The newer rubber or vinyl hoses are more expensive,
but they are more durable in general and do not rot or decay when
buried, making them good buys. In either a soaker hose or a
sprinkler hose, look for one with removable end caps so that you
can flush them out occasionally.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC6">DRIP IRRIGATION SYSTEM </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Spaghetti-type irrigation system, landscape or
garden watering system, drip watering system, microtube system,
emitter system</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Network of small hoses--1/4&quot; to 1/2&quot; in
diameter--with numerous small <i>dripper heads</i> , or <i>emitters</i>,
tiny <i>spray heads</i>, and associated accessories designed to
be custom assembled for each individual garden layout. They are
usually made of black plastic, to prevent sun penetration and
algae formation. Each brand is sold with its own accesories of
dripper heads, <i>hose adapters, T-couplings </i>and <i>connectors</i>
(for tapping into the supply line), <i>elbow connectors, hole
punches, hole plugs, clamps </i>or<i> mounting clips, spikes </i>or
<i>support stakes, </i>and<i> distributors</i>, complete with
several built-in valves, and of course, <i>tubing</i>, or <i>line.</i>
You may also need (or kit may include) a <i>vacuum breaker,
filter, pressure regulator</i> with hose bibb connector, and <i>wall
clips</i>. Usually you can find these bundled into a one-package
starter kit. Smaller diameter (1/4&quot;) kits are for
containers, and larger (3/8&quot; and 1/2&quot;) for gardens.
Should come with appropriate connectors for a spigot or indoor
faucet, and an anti-siphon device. A sort of miniature version is
a <i>drip ring, </i>which fits around the trunks of potted trees
or plants; models are made for 6&quot; to 16&quot; diameter
containers.</p>

<p>USE: Slow, even, efficient watering system which delivers
water only to planted areas, and then only to the root zone, a
drop at a time (though some accessories include misters and small
sprinklers). Minimizes evaporation and delivers water at the
prescribed rate and amount for your plants. Also used for
application of fertilizers. Cuts wasted water dramatically. Used
on potted plants, hanging baskets, planters, trees, shrubs, and
vegetable gardens of all types.</p>

<p>USE TIP: The latest systems are easily assembled, and the
component parts should be readily available from a display at
your local garden center. In cases where a part of the system is
higher than the faucet, or when fertilizing, be sure to use an
anti-siphon <i>backflow preventer</i> or <i>vacuum breaker </i>(a
common plumbing device that screws into the hose line right at
the faucet) to prevent fertilizer from being drawn back into the
home water system should there be a drop in pressure. You may
also require a <i>pressure regulator</i> to lower the pressure to
an ideal level. Both of these should be sold along with the other
parts of the system; they are relatively small valves that screw
into the hose line near the faucet. If your water source is a
pond or other body of water where algae is present, use a <i>filter</i>
, which should also be a readily available component, to trap the
algae. Drip irrigation is particularly useful with vegetable
gardens, but less so with flower gardens.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Start with a small system and experiment, because
uou can always add to your system as you become more familiar
with it. Look for systems that promise to deliver uniform flow
and clog-free operation through the use of devices such as a
pressure- (or flow) regulation valve (PRV), or large, specially
designed dripper openings. They should be unaffected by
temperature. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC7">ROOT WATERER </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Root irrigator, tree feeder, tree feeding
needle, deep root waterer</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Steel tube, just under a yard long, with holes in
the end of the tube which is inserted into the soil, while the
other end is attached to a hose. Some root waterers come with
fertilizer chambers at the top for cartridges which allow you to
fertilize as you water trees and shrubs. The cartridges are
supplied by the waterer manufacturer. </p>

<p>USE: Delivering water and fertilizer directly to the root
areas of trees and shrubs where it is needed most. Ideal when
compacted soil is a problem.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Insert the probe at the edge of the circle around the
tree where the branches end, known as the &quot;drip line.&quot;
Move the waterer about 6 feet every hour or so until you've gone
around the entire tree, using moderate water pressure.
Particularly useful during drought periods.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Root waterers are excellent devices that deliver
the water where it is needed most, eliminating the problem of
shallow-watering trees and shrubs. Models with handles are easier
to insert into the soil. If you want to use the waterer for
applying fertilizer, look for one that has a chamber at the top
for this purpose.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC8">SOIL CORE SAMPLER </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Hollow aluminum rod about 1 inch or less in
diameter and about 3 feet long, with a T handle. 8 inches from
the open end is a short step sticking straight out.</p>

<p>USE: Taking 8 inch core of soil from your lawn to check the
moisture content (to see if you are watering properly) as well as
the texture. Other things you can check are turf quality, pests,
root depth, and thatch buildup, and of course you can use the
soil for testing.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Can also be used to plant tiny crocus bulbs.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC9">WATER SIGNAL </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPITION: Small paper-like marker, about an inch high,
with a point.</p>

<p>USE: Stuck in container soil to indicate if moisture is
present or if the soil is dry, i.e. needs watering. Changes color
accordingly from green to yellow.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC1">WATER WICK </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Small, porous clay cone with length of wick
material attached. Other versions incorporate a wick in a
resevoir type pot, or include cones as part of an irrigation
network, like a <b>drip irrigation system (above)</b>. On the
other extreme are plain wicks (soft woven line not much different
from a shoelace) which have one end hardened with a little
plastic (again, like a shoelace).</p>

<p>USE: Continous and unsupervised watering of houseplants. Wick
end is placed in a bowl of water and the cone in the soil of a
small plant container. Water is wicked into the soil as needed. </p>

<p>USE TIP: Start with moist soil. The amount of water that a
wick can deliver is sufficient for maintenance, but not for
soaking a whole a pot of soil.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC2">PAIL</a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Bucket, utility pail</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Hot-dipped galvanized metal or plastic cylinder,
open on one end, with a slightly curved wire hoop-like handle.
Plastic versions may have one ore even two specially channeled
lips, or spouts, for easy pouring. Some fancier models actually
have two lips. Extra-fancy models have plastic grips in the
middle of the wire handles for comfort, and a molded in grip in
the bottom to aid in pouring. Plastic models also come in a
variety of colors such as red, black, white, beige, brown, and
green. </p>

<p>USE: Carrying water of all kinds and styles, including frozen
water if need be, as well as fertilizers, pesticides, fruit,
vegetables, compost, sand, and gravel. Secondary uses include
carrying tools and even toys.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Bend your knees when lifting. Drain metal pails
completely when not in use. Carrying a full pail of water while
in a hurry is generally conducive to a condition known as
&quot;wetfoot.&quot; Even if you do manage to transport the water
without a spill, the abrupt stop when it is set down often sends
a small wave over the edge. Practice, and carrying smaller
quantities, rather than caution, is the best solution to this
ancient problem.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Plastic pails with reinforced shoulders can carry
a heavier load that those without. In metal pails, look for a
wire-reinforced top, hot-dipped galvanized finish, double-locked
welded seams, and riveted ears.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC3">FERTILIZING &amp; PEST CONTROL EQUIPMENT </a><br>
<a name="RTFToC4">ABOUT FERTILIZING AND PEST CONTROL EQUIPMENT </a></h2>

<p>Keep in mind that toxic chemicals in pesticides of all kinds
should not be mixed with fertilizers, or in some cases, with each
other. Equipment should be kept thoroughly cleaned and in many
cases, dedicated exclusively to the use of a particular pesticide
(mark the containers well). Nozzles, either <i>hollow cone</i>
(circular spray pattern) or <i>flat fan </i>(flat oval spray
pattern) should be removable for cleaning. Measuring cups used
for pesticides should be treated with the same respect (some are
made especially for this purpose.) Remember that dusts are
applied with dusters, while wettable powders are dissolved in
water to be applied as a liquid spray.</p>

<p>Most sprayed products, whether liquid or dust, should be
applied only when there is very little wind. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC5">SOIL TEST KITS </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS:</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A wide variety of kits are on the market, with an
equally wide range of prices and types. Some are electronic
probes (<i>pH meters</i>), some are paper products (usually
litmus tests), some are elaborate portable laboratories with test
tubes, filters, funnels, and testing chemicals for over 500
tests, and some are low-priced kits which test only for one
nutrient at a time. A professonal accessory is a <i>soil probe </i>or<i>
soil sampler</i>, a long tube with a large T-handle for taking
core samples of soil. </p>

<p>USE: Testing soil for pH (degree of acidity or alkalinity)
and, in the cases of the more advanced kits, nutrients. The end
result guides you in your choice of fertilizers and soil
conditioners in your effort to build the right soil for your
garden. Directions are supplied with each kit, but typically you
dig out a small sample of soil and mix it with water and various
chemicals supplied, then watch for it to turn a particluar color.
Litmus paper tests are made by simply putting the paper in
contact with the soil and waiting for it to turn a color that
indicates a particular pH level.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Follow directions carefully, and take soil samples
properly. Most tests require you to dry out your soil first,
which may take a few days.</p>

<p>&#02;BUYING TIPS: For the average gardener, it is easier and
more accurate to send a soil sample to your local Cooperative
Extension Service <b>(Appendix B), </b>though some of the tests,
like the meter or litmus paper roll, are very simple to use.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC6">FERTILIZER SIPHON </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Hose-on</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Small metal or plastic device with female threads
on both ends. Designed to be screwed onto a faucet and connected
to a garden hose, with a small hose that comes out its side that
is placed in a container of liquid fertilizer. The force of the
water running from the faucet through the garden hose draws the
fetilizer mixture into the flow though natural siphon action. </p>

<p>USE: A simple way to fertilize while watering. Especially
useful when applying concentrated fertilizers, as it eliminates
pre-mixing.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Should be clean of all products and dry for storage.
Sometimes siphon devices can be used for applying pesticides, but
those used for this purpose should never be used for fertilizing.
The water to fertilizer ratio usually is 16 parts of water to 1
part of fertilizer, or one tablespoon of fertilizer per gallon of
water that is being applied to the garden--but read the
directions on the device.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Siphons made of brass are usually better than
those of plastic.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC7">HOSE-END SPRAYER </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Hose sprayer, lawn and garden sprayer
(incorrect--too broad)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Glass or plastic container with spray nozzle
(usually made of plastic) built into a top designed to be
attached to the male end of a hose. Like a big atomizer, the
container holds the product to be sprayed. There is some type of
valve to control the outflow, and while most nozzles on these
sprayers are set to disperse the mixture only at a certain ratio,
some nozzles can be adjusted to change the ratio of the product
to water. The nozzle usually controls the type of spray as well.
Should contain an anti-siphon backflow-preventer device. The
container may only hold a pint or two, but the solution is made
from a concentrate that can be dilluted to make up to about 100
gallons of chemical spray. Many chemical products are now
available in plastic containers with caps that act as disposable
hose-end sprayers.</p>

<p>USE: Spraying concentrated fertilizers or pesticides.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Sprayers that have been used for pesticides should
not be used for fertilizers. Containers and nozzles should be
washed thoroughly and dried after each use. Follow the dilution
ratio carefully for the sprayer and chemical product you are
using.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Inexpensive and efficient product. Determining the
correct dilution rate is often the most difficult part of using
these sprayers, so purchase a sprayer with clear instructions and
measurement marks on the container that are easy to read.
Sprayers that have nozzles which can change the dilution ratio
cost more, but may be worth the price. Glass containers may be
breakable, but they do not absorb the chemicals that are put into
them. Inexpensive and very helpful. Products in disposable
hose-end sprayers are very convenient but, because they are
pre-diluted, are likely to cost more per use.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC8">BACKPACK PUMP SPRAYER </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Knapsack sprayer</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A metal or plastic rectangular tank worn on the
back just like a backpack. Capacity ranges from 3-1/2 to 5
gallons. Similar to the <b>compression sprayer (below)</b>, but
designed to be carried on your back instead of lifted by hand,
permitting a larger capacity. A hose and wand with a nozzle on
the end come out of the top, and a pressure levercomes out the
bottom on one side or the other. The user holds the wand with one
hand while pumping the pressure lever with the other hand. </p>

<p>USE: For heavy chemical application over large areas. Often
used by </p>

<p>professional foresters who need to spray large areas of forest
and do not wish to be constantly refilling a smaller sprayer.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Clean nozzles and tank well before storing. Because
backpack sprayers hold more solution than others, do not put in
more chemical than you really need for a given job. To do so is
obviously wasteful and may even be dangerous, as the disposal of
such a concentrated chemical is very difficut to do safely (the
liquid is concentrated because it was intended to be sprayed, or
dispersed lightly over a large area). If poured in one place, it
may enter the water supply. </p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Heavy duty—not often needed by home gardeners.
You might consider this item if you have large wooded areas that
require regular spraying, because it is more convenient than a
compression type which you have to put down and pick up every
time you change locations. Look for a large pumping handle, which
is easier to use. Don't get too large a size: a gallon of water
weighs about 8 lbs. Look for a model which can be easily
converted to be used by left-handed or right-handed people.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC9">bottle or can Sprayer </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Hand sprayer (Same as another item, below),
plunger duster, piston duster</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Hand-held sprayer consisting of a metal tube
about 10&quot; to 12&quot; in length, into which a plunger is
inserted, much like a bicycle pump. At the other end of the
sprayer is a bottle or can that holds the chemical to be sprayed.
Works with a pumping action, much like an atomizer. Some are <i>intermittant</i>
<i>sprayers </i>(spray only on the forward motion) and others are
<i>continuous</i> <i>sprayers </i>(spray steadily due to pressure
built up from pumping). </p>

<p>USE: Spraying liquids, be they pesticides, fertilizers,
detergents, water or any other household or garden liquids.</p>

<p>USE TIP: If the sprayer is used for toxic chemicals it should
not be used for other things, especially not fertilizer or any
foliar spray. Only oil-based sprays should be used in
intermittant sprayers. </p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Look for models with adjustable nozzles that are
easily cleaned and corrosion-resistant. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC10">COMPRESSION SPRAYER </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Pump sprayer, pump-type sprayer, compressed-air
sprayer, pressure sprayer, sprayer/mister, hydraulic hand sprayer</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Metal or plastic tank, usually about 2' tall and
about 8&quot; in diameter, equipped with some kind of pump.
Capacity ranges from 1 to 4 gallons of liquid, but 1-1/2 gallons
is typical. A short hose is attached to a wand with a spray head
with an adjustable nozzle and a squeeze handle. Chemicals are
mixed to the correct dilution rates before being poured into the
tank. The sprayer is then closed and the pressure in the tank is
pumped up by hand. Perhaps the most common type of sprayer. A
smaller version, a <i>pressurized hand sprayer</i>, is a sturdy
quart-sized plastic bottle, in which compression is provided by a
vertical hand pump knob on top, and a cordless electric model is
now available as well. </p>

<p>USE: Applying chemicals to the garden or lawn, or in the case
of the smaller ones, misting plants. Because of their light
weight and portability, compression sprayers are used in areas of
a garden beyond reach of a hose. </p>

<p>USE TIPS: Toxic substances should not be used in sprayers that
are also used for fertilizers. Fine mist spraying should be done
only on a windless day. Mix only the amount of chemical that you
need and use it up completely before washing out the sprayer.
Many plastic compression sprayers use a leather plunger cup (the
disk that builds up the pressure when the sprayer is pumped)
which needs to be kept oiled to insure a tight fit and good
pressure. If possible, take the sprayer apart to clean it. Don't
ever leave a compression sprayer in the sun or near a heat
source--it might explode, or in any case release its contents
with much more pressure than you intend. Always let the pressure
out when you are done using it.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Plastic tanks can absorb chemicals, and metal
tanks do not. Plus, metal wears better. If you only have a need
for a compression sprayer infrequently, or for very small
amounts, the cheaper plastic types will probably be satisfactory,
though there are a few excellent plastic makes on the market,
with permanently fused couplings and removable filters. Look for
a nozzle with a setting that produces an extremely fine
mist--you'll use less chemical. High pressures (up to 150 lbs)
are helpful in creating fine mists. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC11">DUSTER</a></h2>

<p>TYPES:</p>

<p><i>Pump</i></p>

<p><i>Hand-cranked </i></p>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS:</p>

<p><i>Pump: </i>Hand pump, plunger duster</p>

<p><i>Hand-cranked: </i>Hand crank duster</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Small plastic or metal housing with a container
for pesticide and a pump or crank handle.</p>

<p><i>Pump: </i>Looks like a bicycle air pump, with a rigid tube
instead of a hose. Capacity ranges from a few ounces to a few
pounds.</p>

<p><i>Hand-cranked blower: </i>Plastic or metal hopper with a
crank on one side and a long, wide barrel. Squirrel-cage type
fan. Capacity ranges from less than 1 lb to over 9 lbs. Tubes
have flat ends for dispersal of dust, and may be supplied in
various shapes and models. </p>

<p>USE: Dispersing dusts over foliage at close range (around 2')
in small gardens and greenhouses. Pumps are used for the most
accurate applicators.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Simple to operate, as most pesticide dusts can be
used without mixing, especially as opposed to a sprayer, where
they must be mixed with water for each use. However, dusters are
not as accurate or efficient as liquid sprayers. Make sure you
use them only when a wind is not blowing. Pump-type dusters can
spray the undersides of leaves</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Generally inexpensive. All parts should be
non-corrosive.</p>

<hr size="4">

<h2><a name="RTFToC1">HAND SPRAYER </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Utility sprayer, pressure mister,
sprayer/mister, plant mister, plant sprayer, trigger sprayer,
sprayer dispenser, all-purpose sprayer</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: From pint to quart-sized plastic or metal bottle
with trigger spray head, adjustable from a wide, fine mist to a
coarse spray to a steady stream of liquid. An unadjustable model
that makes mists only is called a <i>mister</i>. The pumping
action of the trigger sucks up the liquid from the bottom through
a small tube. Triggers and longer tubes are sold separately for
dispensing from your own gallon containers.</p>

<p>USE: Spraying water or anything mixed with it, such as
fertilizers or pesticides, in small quantities and at targeted
areas. Good for misting tropical plants. Not bad for wetting
clothes when ironing, either (just make sure that there are no
unwanted chemicals inside when you start on your fine garments). </p>

<p>USE TIPS: Don't mix fertilizers and pesticides; if you ever
use these for strong chemicals, note this on a label and try to
use the container for this only.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Prices vary widely--this should be an inexpensive
item. However, better ones can be taken apart for cleaning.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC2">HERBICIDE APPLICATOR </a></h2>

<p>POPULAR BRAND NAME: Killer Kane</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Yard-long plastic tube with small plunger on one
end. Herbicide tablet is inserted into tube which is then filled
with water; when plunger is pushed in by pushing the tube down
onto it, herbicide is released. The amount that is released with
each &quot;hit&quot; is adjustable. </p>

<p>USE: Accurate application of herbicide to dandlelions and
crabgrass in a lawn.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: One of the safer and more economical ways to apply
herbicide, as nothing is likely to go astray of the intended
target.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC3">TROMBONE SPRAYER </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Slide-type Sprayer, slide sprayer, slide pump
sprayer, lance, spray lance</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A type of pump consisting of two tubes, one
inserted in the other, which are pushed and pulled apart. (The
British term for the spraying tube is <i>lance</i>.) One end of
the sprayer is attached to a hose which is placed in the
container of chemical being sprayed. The pushing and pulling of
the cylinders builds up pressure that shoots a long stream out of
the sprayer. The pump works with both the push and pull stroke,
making for an even spray. Nozzle can be adjusted to emit anything
from a fine mist to a long jet.</p>

<p>USE: Spraying trees or tall shrubbery. These have the longest
reach of all the sprayers.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Keep nozzles cleaned and moving parts well oiled.
Empty and clean completely before storing.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: The best of the trombone sprayers is made of
brass, with the nozzles also of brass. Some models have a
grip-type handle attached to both of the sliding tubes which
makes it easier to pump.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC4">BARK SPUD </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Hand tool with a 2&quot; by 4&quot; flat metal
blade, sharpened on its three sides, and a short wooden handle;
overall length is about a foot. Usually solid-socket
construction.</p>

<p>USE: Removing bark from dead or old trees or fence posts to
eliminate insect attraction. Heavier models can be used like a
big knife, to hack off small branches and the like.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC5">COMPOSTING AND MULCHING EQUIPMENT </a></h2>

<h2><a name="RTFToC6">ABOUT COMPOSTING AND MULCHING EQUIPMENT: </a></h2>

<p>Almost any garden soil can be enriched by compost and
protected by mulch. Compost, an organic mixture resulting from
decomposed clippings, cut plants, leaves, and household garbage,
is usually made in a pile that must be constructed of layers and
handled in such a way that all the items in it decompose properly
and result in a dark and easily handled crumbly mixture. Mulch
can be any inorganic or organic substance that pleases the
gardener's eye and pocketbook and, when spread on the soil
surface, keeps weeds from forming and helps retain moisture by
blocking out the sun.<b> </b>Typical mulches include many of the
same items that are used in composting, save, one hopes, for
household garbage.</p>

<p>When weeds, grass clippings, leaves and other plant material
is allowed to rot and is then returned to the garden either as
mulch or compost, the energy contained in these organic materials
is returned to the garden and not wasted. The following products
are sold at many garden centers which help the gardener recycle
organic material which all too often is simply thrown away.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC7">COMPOST BIN </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Composter</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Wood, solid metal, wire, or plastic container
where organic material is kept during the process of
decomposition. Many ingenious designs have been developed around
the world for the purpose of making compost. Some plastic bins
resemble barrels or large garbage cans with vented sides. A drum
version, called a <i>compost tumbler</i>, is mounted on a metal
frame, allowing the drum to revolve and turn the compost, which
speeds up the decomposition action without your having to use a
fork or other tool. Composters usually are covered to keep out
rain, and have holes that insure air circulation and ventilation.
Sides afford an element of insulation, increasing the heat
within, and have some sort of opening for easy removal of
compost. </p>

<p>USE: Contains both compost and the heat compost generates
(from the bacteria breaking down the organic matter); certain
designs (the drum models) facilitate the composting process with
movement and insulation, and any design with a cover helps keep
the compost dry. Most can make compost in around 21 days.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Place on a level surface, and make sure it is located
in a convenient place for continous addition of raw material.
Core temperatures may be over 160<sup>o</sup>, so be careful.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Because of all the competition and innovation in
this field, be sure to shop extensively. Drum-type models should
revolve easily; some of the better models hold as much as 18
bushels. Popular commercial models go for around $100, but many
garden books have designs for bins you can build yourself.
Perhaps the easiest is just made of a circle of wire mesh, or
made by cutting holes in a 30-gallon garbage can. Still, the more
refined models do speed up the process and require less room and
effort than the cruder homemade versions. Look for something that
is easy to remove the compost from, and to stir up.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC8">COMPOST STARTER </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Compost maker</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Bacteria and other microscopic soil organisms in
a powder form, sold in containers (2lbs is typical) as well as
tablets. Some brands are for composting specific materials only,
such as for leaves or grass clippings.</p>

<p>USE: Added to the compost pile or bin to speed up the process
of decomposition and to assure a balanced blend of essential
minerals.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Use the appropriate amount for the size of your
compost bin and wet in well.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Compost starters are available under a variety of
trade names, so shop around. Prices vary a great deal, and
smaller packages may or may not be a bad deal, depending how much
compost can be created per pound of the product--some 2lb boxes
make 1/2 ton of compost, others make 2-1/2 tons; one brand's six
oz package is good for &quot;tons&quot; of compost, and so on.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC9">COMPOST AERATOR TOOL </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Compostool (brand name), compost tool, aerator</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A 30&quot; metal shaft with a &quot;T&quot;
handle bar about 12&quot; long, usually with vinyl grips. The tip
has small, hinged paddles which fold up flat when the tool is
inserted into a compost bin or pile. The paddles open up to turn
the compost as the tool is pulled and twisted out of the bin.</p>

<p>USE: To open, aerate, and turn a compost pile. The tool is
considerably easier to use than a fork.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Keep clean and dry with not in use. Use every few
days.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Check around, as the same tool may be sold at
different places at prices ranging from $13 to $20.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC10">GARDEN SIEVE </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Soil sieve, riddle (English term)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Steel mesh screens strung over a rectangular or
round frame, with legs in the case of larger models, or merely a
platic tub with an open grid for a bottom. The frame may be made
of plastic, metal or wood. Before they were commercially
manufactured, gardeners made their own sieves from galvanized
mesh (such as hardware cloth) nailed to a wooden box frame. One
type, called a Roto-Sieve, has a crank on its top, sort of like
an oversized flour sifter/turntable. </p>

<p>USE: Sifting out large particles from compost before using it
in flower beds or soil mixes.</p>

<p>USE TIP: If compost is too wet, it is sticky and does not sift
well. Compost should be moderately dry and crumbly for sifting.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Look for a sturdy, well-made sieve constructed
from material that will not rust. You may wish to have a couple
of sieves with different mesh sizes. On the other hand, it is not
difficult to make your own, and a flour sieve is good for small
quantities of very fine soils, such as for indoor seed starting.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC11">SHREDDER and CHIPPER </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Mulcher, grinder</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Gasoline or electric motor with cutting mechanism
contained inside a chute, into which you feed leaves or branches.</p>

<p>A <i>shredder </i>has a spinning interior drum with small
hammers (the<i> hammer mills </i>system) or nylon lines called <i>flails</i>
which break up organic material when it comes in contact with
them. Shredders work well on leaves, small twigs, and other light
plant material. They tend to be small, consisting of a plastic or
metal tube, about a foot and a half in diameter, on legs that
make them waist high, with a 1/4 or 1/2 HP electric motor. Some
popular models weigh about 15 lbs and can be placed directly over
a plastic bag, garbage can, or compost pile. They can reduce 8
large trash bags of leaves into one.</p>

<p><i>Chippers</i> are armed with a blade or many blades which
reduce heavier, woody material, including large branches, to a
load of chips. These tend to be large and some models can be
enormous, almost industrial machines.</p>

<p><i>Shredder/Chippers </i>are machines that both shred leaves
and other plant material as well as chip woody material. Machines
that are sold as shredder/chippers usually work with some type of
blade mechanism, but some machines have two separate chutes, one
for shredding and one for chipping, with bother hammers and
blade(s).</p>

<p>USE: Shredding and chipping garden debris, both to rid the
garden of large piles and to create raw material for compost
(smaller pieces) or mulch (larger pieces). Shredded compost
material decomposes much more rapidly than if left whole.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Shredders and chippers can be hazardous machines, and
safety precautions should be followed strictly, such as using
goggles and gloves and keeping hands away from the blades and
hammers. Wear tight-fitting clothes. Don't force a machine to
chip larger branches than it is intended to accommodate.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Most gardeners can get by with one of the smaller
electric shredder/chippers unless they have a large estate.
Shredder/chippers at bargain prices are probably not a good
buy—expect to pay $100 to over $200 for a well-built, versatile,
reliable machine. 12- to 16-gauge steel is a sign of quality, as
opposed to sheet metal. Look for safety features such as feeding
chutes that make it impossible to insert your hand near the
cutting devices (using small diameter chutes, or chutes longer
than your arm, and the like). Check out the size of the shredding
hopper, the height of the shredder section, and the maximum
diameter wood it can take. Narrow feeder chutes are safer but
slower to use. This is a major purchase, so ask for a
demonstration of the machine that you are considering.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC12">BED RUN WORMS </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Red wigglers, <i>Lumbricus rubellus</i></p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Red earthworms, usually around 6 to 8&quot; in
length, </p>

<p>USE: Help break down kitchen scraps and other compost material
rapidly.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Prepare a tub with plenty of kitchen scraps and
composting material before purchasing these worms. Check a book
on organic gardening for information on raising them.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Though available through mail order firms,
survival of the worms is higher if you can purchase from a garden
center. Fish bait shops are an alternative source. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC1">LAWN MOWERS </a><br>
<a name="RTFToC2">ABOUT LAWN MOWERS </a></h2>

<p>Perhaps the best-known lawn maintenance product, this is part
of American folk lore. Unfortunately, so is the repair of these
sometimes recalcitrant machines. Be sure to buy large power
equipment from a reputable dealer with a well-known service
department. Avoid buying from dealers who are only into power
equipment a little bit: they may not be able to service you
promptly or well.</p>

<p>Power mower gas engines are either 2-cycle or 4-cycle, and the
choice is largely one of personal preference--both require
maintenance. The 2-cycle uses a mixture of oil and gas, while the
4-cylcle just uses high-octane gas for fuel, making it a little
more dependable and powerful but also more complicated to
maintain.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC3">Reel Mower </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Push Mower; push-, hand-, hand-push-, or
power-reel mower; beater bar type mower; cylinder mower</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: 5 to 8 curved blades 14 to 18 inches long mounted
on a reel approximately the same size as the wheels found on
either of its ends. The blades rotate as the mower is moved,
cutting grass as they are drawn over a stationary blade
(&quot;bed knife&quot;) like a pair of giant scissors. This was
the conventional design for all home lawn mowers before rotary
power mowers were introduced after Word War II. The reel mowers
available today are lighter than ever and handles are made from
metal instead of wood. The power reel mower has the same basic
design, but is driven by a gasoline engine above the reel.</p>

<p>USE: Cutting grass that is not too long. Manual reel mowers
are ideal for cutting small lawns, such as in urban areas. And
they are quiet. Fewer blades required for bluegrass and creeping
fescues; more blades are suggested for Southern types such as
Bermuda grasses.</p>

<p>USE TIP: The reel mower works quite well if the blades are
kept sharp, producing a superior, more efficient cut to power
rotary mowers, which cut only with the tips of their blades. The
bed knife should be adjusted so that the entire length of the
cutting blade makes contact with it when the mower is pushed. To
check the bed knife, insert a piece of paper between the blade
and the bed knife. It is well adjusted if the paper is cut the
full length of the blades when the reel is turned. Reel mowers
are better suited to lawns that are mowed regularly, as they do
not cut tall grass well. </p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Look for a reel mower that is light weight but
still well made. Power reel mowers are preferred by many
gardeners and turf specialists because they cut grass cleaner
than <b>rotary mowers (below) </b>due to their scissor-like
cutting action. Make sure that the mowing height can be adjusted.
They are more easily stored than power mowers, and use no fuels
--other than refreshments for the person pushing. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC4">Rotary Mower </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS:</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Either an electric or gasoline motor mounted on a
metal casing below which rotates a propeller-like blade with a
diameter of 18 to 24&quot;. Mostly gasoline powered, rotary
mowers are the most common design of power mowers today. Electric
mowers may be either battery-driven or plugged into an outlet by
a long cord. Battery powered mowers run for about 45 minutes on a
charge. Gasoline mowers are driven by either a two-cycle or
four-cycle engine with an average strength of 3 to 4 horsepower.
The higher-priced gasoline rotary mowers are usually
self-propelled (that is, the motor not only turns the blade but
drives the wheels as well) while the less expensive ones must be
pushed. Smaller models have flip-over handles which saves you
having to turn the mower around at the end of each pass. Mowing
height on most models can be modified. Some models either can be
converted to, or are, <i>mower-mulchers</i> which cut the grass
clippings very finely so they settle down on the soil where they
act as a mulch that decomposes and returns nitrogen to the soil.
If you don't mulch your clippings you need to rake them up or bag
them. Two basic bagging designs are made: <i>rear bagging</i>, in
which the grass clippings are spewed into a bag that hangs from
the handles, or <i>side-discharge</i>, which spews them onto the
lawn or a side-mounted bag.</p>

<p><i>Riding mowers</i> or <i>lawn tractors</i> (self-propelled
mowers that you sit on and drive, as opposed to the standard ones
that you push, called <i>walk-behind</i> or <i>walking</i>
mowers) are often rotary types, usually feature the blade
housing, or <i>mower deck</i>, under the seat, but some, called <i>front-cut
mowers</i>, have the blade housing in front, making for a more
manouverable mower that can also cut underneath fences, bushes,
and trees. Width of cut usually ranges from 26 to 42&quot;. In
all cases, a <i>grass catcher</i>, usually a canvas and metal or
plastic container that trails along behind the mower, is a
recommended accessory for catching the clippings. There is as
much competition among manufacturers of riding mowers as there is
for automobiles, it seems--and as many detailed choices: width,
clutch, automatic transmission (hydrostatic drive), control
panel, steering (wheel or levers), engine access for maintenance,
4-wheel steering, warranties, and the number of optional
attachments, like snow blowers, that you can use.</p>

<p>The newest type of mower is quite different. The <i>nylon
string mower, </i>or <i>trimmer/mower,</i> is a large <b>string
trimmer</b> <b>(Chapter 7)</b> on wheels, and may be either gas-
or electric-powered<b>. </b>It does not have a metal blade but
rather a rapidly spinning nylon cord, and this design may prove
to be a safer lawn mower to use. Another new type is a <i>floating
mower</i>, which actually floats on a cushion of air and has no
wheels. After a long, hot day mowing a large lawn with a heavy,
conventional mower, many gardeners wish to float, too, for which
a large swimming pool is recommended. They might then be
considered yet another type of &quot;floating mower.&quot;</p>

<p>USE: Cutting lawns, especially larger lawns and those with
long grass (stemming from extended time between mowings). Riding
mowers are helpful when you have more than 3/4 of an acre to mow.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Keep the blades of rotary mowers sharp, or else the
grass is beaten and bruised instead of cut. The oil in
gasoline-powered mowers that have resevoirs is essential to their
operation, and should be checked regularly and changed completely
once during the mowing season. The rotating blade is extremely
dangerous and capable of slinging stones, so safety precautions
should be followed when using these mowers. Rear bagging type
mowers allow you to maneuver a bit more easily. Rotary power
mowers cut taller grass than <b>reel-type mowers (above). </b>Always
determine the best length for your grass, and keep in mind that
much damage comes from cutting it too short. Leave the
grass-catcher off most of the time: grass clippings are a good
source of nutrients.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: The electric or battery-powered rotary mowers are
best suited to small lawns that are mowed regularly. Gasoline
powered rotary mowers capable of cutting tall or tough grasses
are generally heavier duty than electric mowers. Self-propelled
mowers are helpful for large, hilly areas or for people who have
trouble pushing. Some gasoline powered mowers come with
push-button electronic ignition instead of pull-cord starters,
but you pay dearly for this convenience. When buying any model,
but especially the larger ones, be sure that you understand which
attachments are standard and which must be purchased as extras. <i>Leaf
shredders </i>are one of the most useful attachments for those
gardeners who have lots of trees. Look for blades that are
attached to the drive shaft with a <i>half-moon key, </i>or<i>
Woodruff key</i>--it will shear off if you hit a big object,
instead of severely damaging the entire drive shaft and engine.
Although two-cycle engines are better for hilly terrains, the
choice is largely one of size: of lawn and of mower, as well as
of the person doing the work.</p>

<p>Look for the following safety features: a rear deflector,
which is a hinged flap on the rear, and which stops flying rocks
and sticks from hitting you; a similar deflection guard at the
discharge opening that stays in place automatically; and a
well-placed exhaust system and muffler, away from the grass
catcher bag.</p>

<p>Wide selections of riding mowers may be found at specialized
outdoor equipment dealers; many garden centers do not sell riding
mowers because this requires another expertise and maintenance
capability, as well as a lot of space. Front-cutting riding
mowers are more expensive. With all riding mowers, check to see
what other attachments, such as snow blowers, are available, and
how easy it is to attach or remove them. The turning radius is an
important point of comparison (less is better). Above all, test
drive the mower to see how it feels. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC5">LAWN AND PATIO CLEANING EQUIPMENT </a></h2>

<h2><a name="RTFToC6">LAWN SWEEPER </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Push-type lawn sweeper, lawn sweep</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A long drum about 8&quot; in diameter and 20 to
30&quot; long, fitted around an axle, with rows of bristles and
two wheels on either end. A canvas hopper trails behind to catch
leaves or grass clippings that are thrown back by the bristles
when the sweeper is pushed over the lawn. The handle holds or is
part of the hopper and may be attached directly to the wheels.
Hoppers hold 6 to 9 bushels of debris. Some larger models are
designed to be towed behind a riding mower or lawn tractor. </p>

<p>USE: Cleaning up grass clippings and leaves. </p>

<p>USE TIP: Keep all metal parts cleaned and oiled. Sweepers work
best on level and dry lawns. </p>

<p>BUYING TIP: A good lawn sweeper is a definite labor advantage
over raking and much quieter than a blower.</p>

<p>Sweepers with handles attached directly to the wheels are
sturdier. The hopper floors of better sweepers are made of steel
or fiberglass to reduce wear and friction. Narrower models do a
better job on uneven terrain.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC7">BLOWER</a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Leaf blower, blower/vac</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Electric or gasoline-powered 5 to 10 horsepower
motor with a large tube or accordion hose attached, much like a
powerful canister vacuum cleaner with the hose attached to the
outflow vent. Some of the smaller blowers are designed to be
hand-held and are more often powered by electricity (some may
have shoulder straps). Cordless models are available too, and may
be called <i>electric brooms. </i>Larger (usually gas-powered)
blowers designed to fit on the back with straps are known as <i>backpack
blowers</i>. The largest are wheeled contraptions resembling lawn
mowers. A number of attachments that resemble large vacuum
cleaner heads fit onto the hose; some work as misters or
sprayers. A variation is the <i>power wand</i>, a multipurpose
tool with the moter at the ground end, and that has a blower
attachment. Certain models have attachments for cleaning gutters.
And some are convertible to vacuums, complete with a cart for the
leaf bag. </p>

<p>USE: Blowing away leaves, debris, water on patios and tennis
courts, and even light snow, as a substitute for a vigorous
sweeping or raking. Vaccuums can pick up light debris like leaves
and chop them for mulch.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Wear goggles and ear protectors when operating a
blower. The latter is especially important if you are operating a
powerful gasoline- driven blower, which is quite noisy. Never
point the nozzle of a blower toward people.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: If you want to blow debris and leaves from beds
but leave the mulch, look for one of the less powerful blowers,
probably an electric one. If you have heavy leaf work to do,
consider the more powerful gasoline- powered blowers. Look for a
16-gauge cord on electric blowers, and adjustable speed. Throttle
should fit your hand; some models are adapted for left-handed
users. Air speed is one rating measure of blowers, if you need to
compare. Those who garden in small spaces can find little
justification for the expense of this power tool in any case.
Test them to get the feel, first. Certain models have a the power
unit at the ground level, which may be harder to use because of
clogging with leaves. Electric models are much quieter and
vibrate less than gas-powered models. Shop around--there is much
competition here.</p>

<hr size="4">

<h2><a name="RTFToC1">PUSH BROOMS </a></h2>

<p>TYPES:</p>

<p><i>Heavy duty</i></p>

<p><i>Sidewalk and garage</i></p>

<p><i>Floor</i></p>

<p><i>Porch and Patio</i></p>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: </p>

<p><i>Heavy duty: </i>Street broom, street sweeper type, barn
broom, outdoor broom</p>

<p><i>Porch and Patio:</i> Lawn broom</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Push-type brooms with large bristled heads
mounted to long wooden or fiberglass handles. </p>

<p><i>Heavy duty:</i> 14-18 inch wide head, usually with two sets
of five rows of tough fibre bristles, sometimes over six inches
long. This is what you see used by professional street sweepers.
Bristles made of African Bass, palmyra stalks, or plastic, and
are suitable for wet or dry use. </p>

<p><i>Sidewalk and garage: </i>At 18 to 24 inches, wider than the
heavy duty model, with shorter, palmyra fibre bristles typically
4&quot; long. A steel version with plastic bristles is available
for caked up dirt or debris, in models up to 36&quot; wide. Made
for wet or dry use.</p>

<p><i>Floor: </i>More finished wooden head than the above types,
with Tampico fibre or plastic bristles usually arond 3&quot;
long. 18-24&quot; wide.</p>

<p><i>Porch and Patio: </i>Steel head with stiff 3&quot; plastic
bristles, around one foot wide.</p>

<p>USE: Sweeping patios, terraces, garages, walks, and driveways.
Also for sweeping clippings and leaves from thick, well-mowed
lawns. </p>

<p>USE TIP: Store brooms with the bristles up to prevent them
from getting bent. Move the handle to the opposite side if the
bristles are worn on one side.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: A good push broom is reinforced where the handle
is attached to the head, usually with a metal shank screwed to
the handle. Handles that are just stuck into a hole in the head
are likely to work loose. Braces can be purchased separately.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC2">BAGS AND ACCESSORIES </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Lawn and leaf bags, garbage bags</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Large black, brown, or green plastic bags,
varying in thickness from 1 to 4 mil (thousandths of an inch) and
with an average capcity of about 6 bushels or 30 gallons, the
size of a standard large garbage can. Available up to 55 gallons
capacity. Some brands are enormous, up to 45&quot; x 96&quot;,
sometimes called <i>banana bags</i>. Now available in
biodegradeable plastic. Accessories include a plastic <i>hoop</i>,
about 2' in diameter, which clamps onto the edge of the opening
of the bag to hold it open for loading, and a <i>stand</i> or
small two-wheel <i>cart</i>, or <i>caddie</i>, similar to a
baggage cart, which holds the hoop and bag. Enormous plastic bins
that look like giant garbage cans are used by professional
landscapers, but can be found in some garden centers, especially
those that have their own landscaping business. They are usually
green.</p>

<p>USE: Bagging leaves, grass, or garden clippings for disposal.
Hoops and carts make it more efficient, especially for people who
have trouble lifting large objects. Biodegradeable bags are
required in some communities where they are trying to cut down on
landfill debris--the bag disintegrates, allowing the natural
contents to degrade in the landfill like compost.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: If you are planning to use plastic bags for hedge
trimmings, be sure to cut the branches into very small pieces or
else they will pierce the bags and block you from filling them
with any appreciable quantity. When disposing of concrete or
plaster rubble, or gravel fill, just put a little in each bag so
you can handle them easlily.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Professional bins are not all that expensive--many
can be had for around $30. 1.5 mil bags are light and tear
easily; 3 or 4 mil is heavy duty. Look for bags with no seams. A
reusable alternative to bags is a 7 or 10 foot square piece of
reinforced plastic or burlap, with handles, which lays flat on
the ground while you sweep or rake leaves and garden refuse onto
it; the corners are easily gathered together for transportation.
These are often sold in packages as <i>totes</i>, or burlap <i>squares</i>.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC3">LAWN CARE TOOLS </a><br>
<a name="RTFToC4">AERATOR</a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Soil digger</p>

<p>TYPES:</p>

<p>Sod coring</p>

<p>Spiked, or Spiked Disk (or disc)</p>

<p>Lawn aerator sandals</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A long-handled metal tool with two or four
hardened steel spikes on the working end and a cross-bar grip.
The spike end is forced into the soil by stepping on the tool
much as with a shovel. </p>

<p><i>Sod coring aerator: </i>Spikes are hollow tubes that remove
plugs of earth when forced into the lawn. </p>

<p><i>Spiked (</i>or<i> spike) disk (</i>or<i> disc) aerator: </i>Consists
of a disc with numerous spikes protruding from it and is rolled
over a lawn by pulling or pushing, by hand or with a small
tractor. </p>

<p><i>Lawn aerator sandals: </i>Spiked platforms which are
strapped onto your shoes like roller skates and worn while you
walk around the lawn (such as while mowing). </p>

<p>USE: Opening up sections of lawns where the soil has become
compacted by traffic or nature, or for cultivating heavy soils
without disturbing the soil structure.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Hollow tube spikes should be kept open. Remove any
plug of soil that becomes trapped in them. Remember to remove
aerator sandals from your feet before entering your
house--they're not great for floors.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: If the entire lawn is in need of aeration, it is
time to consider tilling and reseeding or sodding. The spiked
disc aerators cost more than most gardeners can justify.</p>

<p>____________________________________________________________ </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC5">ROLLER</a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Lawn roller</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Large metal or plastic drum, usually from 14 to
24&quot; in diameter and from 2 to 3' wide, with handle attached
so it can be pushed or pulled. Today's rollers are hollow and
designed to be filled with water when they are used, making them
lighter to transport and store. Old-fashioned ones were filled
with cement, and were often homemade.</p>

<p>USE: Preparing a lawn for seeding or sodding or for rolling
out sod after it is planted to insure good root contact with the
soil.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Roll a seed bed both horizontally and vertically to
insure a smooth, level surface. Adjust the weight with water to
compact the soil properly--you should be able to leave slight
footprints after rolling.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Rent a roller instead of buying one, unless you
are likely to reseed a lawn or seed bed regularly.</p>

<p>____________________________________________________________ </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC6">SOD TAMPER </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Lawn tamper, tamper</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Heavy, flat, metal square about 8 or 10&quot; on
a side, with a 4 foot long perpendicular handle in the middle.
Models vary in weight from around 11 to 25 pounds. </p>

<p>USE: Leveling and tamping down sod after it is planted, seed
beds before seeding, or sand and gravel before pouring concrete
or laying brick. Does many of the same jobs as a <b>roller
(above).</b></p>

<p>USE TIP: Work in an overlapping pattern to insure smooth and
level surfaces.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Unless you are a professional sod layer, or doing
it for a lot of neighbors, this tool may be better to rent than
to buy.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC7">SPREADER </a></h2>

<p>TYPES:</p>

<p><i>Broadcast spreader</i></p>

<p><i>Drop spreader</i></p>

<p><i>Organic spreader</i></p>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Seed sower, seeder (Note: These names are used
when this is used to spread seed), lawn spreader</p>

<p><i>Broadcast spreader:</i> Rotary spreader, rotary broadcast
spreader</p>

<p><i>Drop spreader:</i> Wheel drop spreader</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Hand-operated device carried like a front pack,
or a cart-like device pushed over the lawn like a lawn mower,
both of which have hoppers made of steel, structural foam
plastic, regular plastic, or canvas. </p>

<p><i>Broadcast spreader</i><b>: </b>Hopper which holds material
to be broadcast, below which is a circular, ridged, revolving
disk. There are two basic types--hand-driven and wheeled.
Hand-driven broadcast spreaders, also known as <i>shoulder</i> or
<i>hand spreaders,</i> are suspended from the shoulder by straps
and the broadcast platform is turned by a hand crank on the side
as you walk along. Wheeled models, called <i>push</i> or <i>rotary
broadcast spreaders</i>, are similar, except that the hopper is
on a metal cart and the broadcast platform is turned by the
movement of the wheels as it is pushed. Hoppers on wheeled
spreaders can be tall cylinders holding as much as 5 gallons or
60 lbs. Popular brand name is Cyclone, which makes a range of
models. Spreads material as wide as 30 feet.</p>

<p><i>Drop spreader:</i><b> </b>Two-wheel cart like device that
drops the material through an opening in the bottom as the
spreader is pushed over the lawn. A control lever that opens (to
a particular size) and closes the drop mechanism is located on
the handle of the spreader. Spreads material only to the width of
the hopper, about 20.&quot; Capacity up to 75 lbs.</p>

<p><i>Organic spreader: </i>Perforated steel drum, about 2-1/2
cubic feet capacity, which holds manures or other organic
material. Holes are cut so there is either 48% or 63% open space.</p>

<p>USE: Spreading fertilizer, seed, lime, pesticide, and other
powdered or pelletized materials on a garden, field or lawn. </p>

<p>USE TIP: Broadcast spreaders tend to concentrate the material
near the spreader. Because of this, it is important to overlap
when broadcasting to get an even coverage. Drop spreaders
disperse material more regularly and evenly than the broadcast
spreaders, so it is important <u>not</u> to overlap. On the other
hand, drop spreaders cover less ground with each pass than
broadcast spreaders; they are more accurate but more work.
Spreaders should be cleaned and oiled after each use.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Broadcast spreaders are more efficient for large
areas because they scatter seed and other material over a wider
space. However, drop spreaders are more reliable in the amount
and the eveness of material dispersed, making them a marginly
better buy. Be sure to check that the spreader you purchase can
handle the types of material you are using. Plastic spreaders are
more rust-resistant. Many larger, professional models are
available for gardeners with extremely large areas. Look for
models with easily operated gates. Steel bargain models are
likely to corrode very quickly and should be avoided.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC1">STARTING AND GROWING PRODUCTS </a><br>
<a name="RTFToC2">SEED STARTING PRODUCTS </a><br>
<a name="RTFToC3">ABOUT SEED STARTING PRODUCTS: </a></h2>

<p>In late winter and early spring, about the same time that the
seed displays make their annual appearance, garden center shelves
contain bags of starter soils, seed flats, seed flat heaters,
light units, peat pots, soil blockers and myriad other products
to help you start your own plants from seed. Most gardeners find
growing plants from seed is fun, not to mention a therapeutic
activity in late winter. Perhaps because it is often done in the
house, or becuase it is more of a hobby than a utilitarian job,
there is enormous competition in this area, resulting in a
bewildering variety of types and models and packaged sets.
Chances are there is a specialized product for any problem you
might encounter in this delicate work.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC4">SEED STARTING MIX </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Soilless mix (Chapter 1)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Light weight soil substitute, usually light brown
with white specks. The white specks are either <b>vermiculite</b>
or <b>perlite (Chapter 1)</b>, and the brown is <b>peat (Chapter
1) </b>and other organic material. Contains no soil, and is
sterile, so it contains no bacteria (all the bacteria has been
killed off by heating so that none will attack the vunerable
seedlings). Retains moisture extremely well. </p>

<p>USE: Starting seeds. Constant moisture is essential to the
germination and growth of seeds. Sterile soil prevents the
problem of &quot;damping-off,&quot; a fungal disease that kills
seedlings.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Wet thoroughly before using. It is more difficult to
moisten after seed has been sown than before sowing. Tepid or
warm water is absorbed more quickly than cool or cold water.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Mixes that contain perlite are preferred to those
that contain vermiculite, because vermiculite, which is lighter
than perlite, tends to rise to the surface when water is applied.
Most sterile starter mixes on the market are fairly reliable, so
just look for those within your budget. Even cheaper is mixing
your own from milled peat and perlite, or any recipe found in a
good general gardening book.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC5">PEAT PELLET </a></h2>

<p>POPULAR BRAND NAMES: Jiffy<sup>-</sup>7<sup> </sup></p>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: One Step disk, growing cube</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Small brown disk, about 1-1/2 inches wide and
1/16 inches thick, made from compressed peat and wood fibers that
is sterile and pH balanced, Expands on contact with water to
become a combination small pot of peat and growing medium. Peat
pellets are encased in a light plastic netting that keeps the
peat intact. Jiffy 7's expand to 1-2/3 inches by 1-2/3 inches,
but a deeper Jiffy 7 (Extra Depth Pellets, No. 727) expands to
2-3/8 inches overall. Another version is a block of cubes stamped
out of a whole sheet of this material; some brands include
fertilizer and use a gel instead of a net to hold it all
together.</p>

<p>USE: Self-contained pots and planting medium all in one, for
starting slow- growing annuals and vegetables from seed. Once
seedlings have grown and have been thinned to only one plant per
&quot;pot,&quot; the pot itself is set directly in the garden,
avoiding transplant shock.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Tepid water causes disks to expand more quickly. To
allow the gel to work best, allow the disks to sit for a few
hours after expanding. Once seeds begin to germinate, the medium
should be kept evenly moist.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: A real convenience if you are just starting to
grow plants from seed, as there is no soil to mix nor pots to
fill. The plastic nets on Jiffy 7's do not decompose, and because
they remain in the soil some gardeners prefer the other types
which decompose over time.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC6">PEAT POT </a></h2>

<p>POPULAR BRAND NAMES: Jiffy-Pots, Fertil Pots</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Small pot made from compressed peat and wood
fiber, and sometimes fertilizer. Standard sizes include 2 inches
square, 2-1/4 inches round or square, and 3 inches round or
square. 100% biodegradable. <i>Dwarf pots</i> are a bit wider and
less tapered than normal; <i>Long Tom </i>pots are taller.</p>

<p>USE: Starting seeds, particularly with new sterile soiless
mixes. The pot is planted directly into the garden when the
seedling is ready, avoiding transplant shock as well as the work
of repotting. Especially suitable for bedding plants and
vegetables that may normally be hard to transplant, among others.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Remove any small part of the pot that sticks above
the soil level. when setting the plants into the
garden--otherwise it acts as a wick, drawing water away from the
plant and into the air. </p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Peat pots are about the same price as the peat
pellets (above) but you need to fill peat pots with a growing
medium, making them ultimately just a little more expensive.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC7">SEED FLAT </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Seed tray, nursery flat</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Shallow, rectangular, plastic or fiberglass tray
approximately 12 inches by 20 inches and about 2 to 3 inches
deep, with ribs and usually with drainage holes. When sold with a
clear plastic top, may be considered a <i>propagator</i>, which
is then usually packaged with other seed-starting products such
as the pots and other items listed here. </p>

<p>USE: A place to put peat pots or other small containers. Can
also be filled directly with soil and seeds, though this is not
recommended. Some are sectioned to hold small pots.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Avoid overwatering, especially if your flat has no
drainage holes. When peat pots of seedlings are placed in a seed
flat, apply no more water than the pots can absorb in less than
one half hour. Professional growers with little greenhouse space
to waste plant seeds directly into seed flats, but seedlings'
roots can then intertwine, and there is considerable transplant
shock when seedlings are cut apart and moved into larger
containers. </p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Look for seed flats that are sturdy and do not
bend if the weight of pots is unevenly dispersed in the flat.
Foam plastic has greater structural rigidity, making it easier to
carry a loaded flat. Plastic resists rot, mildew, fungi, and
other damage.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC8">SECTIONED FIBER SEED TRAY </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Jiffy Strip</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: 2-1/4 inches square, compressed fiber pots
attached at their tops to form a tray, or strip, of 12 units,
like a large ice cube tray. Commonly sold with plastic trays
which they fit into perfectly and which contain drainage holes
for excess water. Some are designed especially to fit onto
windowsills, called <i>windowsill sets.</i></p>

<p>USE: Growing seedlings, when filled with a growing medium.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Growing medium should be pre-moistened before sowing
seed. Sections can be cut apart and completely buried in the
garden (where they will disintegrate naturally) instead of
transplanting. Sow several seeds in each section to compensate
for poor germination; seedlings should then be thinned to one
seedling per section.</p>

<p>USE TIP: </p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Fiber planting trays are as inexpensive as
individual <b>peat pots (above)</b>, and more convenient to use.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC9">STARTING TRAY </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Compartmentalized tray, seedling flat, seedling
tray, growing tray, plug tray, planter flat, plug seedling tray,
cell pack, cell tray</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Light weight plastic or biodegradable paper tray
divided into separate cubes, like a muffin tin, for growing
individual seedlings. Cells are 2 to 3 inches deep and up to 3
inches square or round; round ones are also available as small as
one inch deep and in diameter. Trays vary in size from small six
packs (approximately 4 inches x 8 inches) to approximately 12
inches x 20 inches. Some have a flat tray underneath to catch
excess water.</p>

<p>Some more elaborate <i>self-watering</i> models, with drainage
holes and capillary matting (see <b>Capillary Waterer, below</b>),
are sold with outer trays, without drainage holes, that they fit
into like a sleeve. The seedlings are watered indirectly—water
put in the bottom tray soaks up into the starting tray. A high,
clear plastic cover is provided for extra climate control at the
germinating stage in the case of <i>propigating trays. </i>The
plainest version is a<i>seed pan</i> , which looks like a
caserole dish.</p>

<p>USE: Growing seedlings for transplanting.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Sow a couple of seeds in each compartment to
compensate for poor germination. If more than one seed
germinates, they should be thinned out, leaving only one seedling
in each section. Remove clear plastic covers as soon as the seeds
germinate. All the plants in each tray should have the same
watering requirements and planting times for ease of maintenance.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Sectioned trays are more expensive than single
flats, like those used by many professional growers. Sectioned
trays, however, are worth the extra money because they prevent
root competition among seedlings, as roots can develop only
within the confines of each section-- thus transplant shock is
reduced. These trays can be a good investment if you purchase
some that can be used over several years. The self-watering trays
are easy to use and worth the extra cost. Look for stiff, solid
fabrication that will not easily break. Using your old coffee
cups or yogurt containers is good for recycling, but not as easy.
And they are hard to carry out to the garden for tranplanting.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC10">CAPILLARY WATERER </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Variety of designs which include a large resevoir
of water which is delivered as needed to pots via a sponge-like
mat or wicks: capilllary action. Most have a tray for pots which
is covered with channels for the water; the mat sits on top of
the channels. The resevoir may look like a coffee urn.</p>

<p>USE: Long term, consistent watering of seedlings or
houseplants. Often used by people to travel a lot.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Make sure tray is on a level surface. Experiment to
get to know the rate and volume your plants require.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC11">SEED GROWING KIT </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Seed starter kit, seed starting kit </p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Prepackaged group of products containing all of
the necessary items for starting plants from seed. They often
contain pots, flats, planting medium, a thermometer, labels and
fertilizer. The number of seedlings you can produce with one of
these kits depends upon the size of the kit.</p>

<p>USE: Simple and sure germination setup.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Follow the general directions for growing plants from
seed. If your kit does not have directions, use a gardening book.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: It is usually cheaper to buy these prepackaged
kits than it is to purchase each item separately. If you prefer
peat or fiber pots to plastic, or peat disks, look for seed
growing kits that have just what you want. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC12">SEED SCOOP </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Seed planter, seed sower</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Small hand-held scoop that resembles an ice cream
scoop with divider across the middle that has a small open space
at the bottom for seeds to pass through. The space behind the
divider serves as a hopper for the seeds which pass underneath
the divider one at a time. Smaller versions look like big test
tubes, palm-sized powder compacts, giant hyperdermic needles, or
long and narrow shoehorns. This last item is an English import
called a <b>widger (Chapter 5)</b>--some people call it the <i>everything
tool </i>because it is not limited to seed planting, but is more
often used for digging.</p>

<p>USE: Planting small quantities of seeds accurately. </p>

<p>USE TIP: Can also be used for adding small amounts of
fertilizer.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: The least expensive version is the clear plastic
tube, though it could be argued that this is only one small step
up from using seed packets or pieces of cardboard folded into a
V-shape, which are, of course, still less expensive.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC13">SOIL BLOCKER </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Soil block, soil block maker</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Small metal device that compresses soil or
planting medium to form four tight 2 inches soil blocks. Another
version, a <i>soil cuber</i>, makes 20 3/4 inches cubes at once.
Four plastic blocks called <i>cube attachments </i>make 3/4 inch
holes in the large blocks for cubes to go into. A spring-held
lever forces the soil or medium out of the blocker neatly.</p>

<p>USE: Makes cubes that are both the planting medium and the
transplant container, an efficient way to grow plants from seed
without transplant shock. Once the seed has sprouted in small
cubes it can be dropped into the larger cube made by the soil
blocker. </p>

<p>USE TIP: The more moist the growing medium, the tighter the
cubes, and the more likely they will hold together while the seed
germinates and grows. Seed germinates better in the smaller cube
than in the soil blocks. Special blends of peat humus of
vermiculite make ideal blocks.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Not many different makes are available, but prices
do vary.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC14">LIGHT UNITS </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Growing lights, growing lamp units, plant
lights, propagation lights</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Basically a standard fluorescent light fixture
that has been adapted to the special needs of indoor plant
growing. Typically a two-lamp fixture, mounted in a reflective
metal hood. Some models come as part of a unit that includes one
or two shelves for plants, and a frame that holds the light at
the right distance above them. 24 inches or 48 inches 20 or 40
watt <i>wide spectrum</i> (or<i> full spectrum </i>or<i>
continuous spectrum </i>) fluorescent tubes, sometimes called <i>grow
lights</i>, are used, though one &quot;cool white&quot; and one
&quot;warm white&quot; is recommended by some experts. Some
brands claim to last 24,000 hours.</p>

<p>USE: Providing the light required for plants to make their own
food, or photosynthesize, indoors and away from sunny windows.
Light units are also ideal for starting plants indoors, as they
provide consistent light that can be controlled at this delicate
stage in a plant's life.</p>

<p>USE TIP: The amount of light produced from fluorescent lamps
diminishes towards their ends, and as the plants must be close to
the fixture, you must place the plants with this in mind. You
must also change the height of the fixture as the plants grow to
keep them at the same, ideal distance. Plants also need a period
of darkness, so plant light units should not be on all the time.
An <b>automatic timer (below)</b> is useful to control the amount
of light the plants receive. It is important that the period of
light the plants and seedlings receive be fairly consistent and
mock natural day length conditions. Units can be covered with
plastic to retain humidity, the lack of which is often a problem
during the winter heating season. Specialized grow lights work
best with flowering houseplants; vegetables are less fussy. Do
not use <i>white</i> or <i>daylight</i> tubes.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Light units are more efficient if there are two 4
foot fluorescent tubes. Units sold specifically for plants are
more expensive than the same unit sold for general lighting use,
such as for workshops, but you usually still need to get the
&quot;wide spectrum&quot; lamp at a garden center. Because they
are a bit costly it is a good idea to use them in tandem with a
regular &quot;cool white&quot; lamp. If you buy a regular
fixture, you need to make the frame and shelves yourself—not a
difficult task for some people, but for those with little time or
inclination to build or assemble, the ready-made unit is a big
advantage.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC15">LIGHT AND MOISTURE METERS </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Small, hand-held meters. Sometimes both functions
are combined in a single unit, but more commonly they are sold
separately. Moisture meters have a probe, either on the end of a
cable or part of the meter body. </p>

<p>USE: Estimating light and moisture content in soils and
growing areas; particularly useful under artificial conditions
such as with light units or greenhouses. May also help discover
problem conditions that affect especially sensitive plants. Some
moisture meters, usually sold as part of a system, are connected
to water computers that turn water on and off as needed. pH
meters often give only a range of reading.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: The primary use of light meters is checking the
difference in intensity of light from the center to the edge of
an area lit by fluorescent tubes. Moisture meters connected with
water computers prevent the water from going on when it is
raining. Always wipe off the tips of the probes after use.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Once you have learned the proper level of
moisture for your plants, you may find that your finger can
replace the probe. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC1">AUTOMATIC TIMER </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS:</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Clock mechanism that is plugged into an
electrical outlet. Many different types. The simplest are
mechanical--just a 24 hour clock dial and box with a plug-- and
the most sophisticated are electronic, capable of handling a
number of devices at once. </p>

<p>USE: Remote, automatic control of electrical devices, such as
growing lights. Turns the light unit on and off automatically in
the morning and shuts it off in the evening for growing things in
dark areas where daylight must be simulated or supplemented.</p>

<p>USE TIP: If you are using light units for growing seedlings,
set the timer to simulate the day length during the time of the
year that the seeds would germinate and grow outdoors. For
example, if you are growing seed indoors in February that would
normally be sown outside in April or May, set your timer for the
April and May day length and not the shorter February time.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Check around before purchasing a timer. Good
timers may not cost as much as bad ones, so be sure to ask for
advice before making your choice. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC2">HEATING MAT </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Heat mat, propagation heat mat</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Two rubber mats with electric heating wires
sandwiched between them. The heating wires are attached to a
thermostat which is in turn plugged into an electrical outlet.
Supplied with transformer for low-voltage current. Usually
rectangular, but available in long and narrow shapes for window
sills.</p>

<p>USE: Providing consistent, gentle bottom heat, essential to
good seed germination. </p>

<p>USE TIP: Thermostats may not be accurate. It is a good idea to
insert a thermometer into the seed flat itself to check the
temperature of the flat and adjust the thermostat accordingly.
This is very important.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Do not buy a heating mat that does not come with a
thermostat.</p>

<p>Many gardeners have grown plants from seed for years without a
heating mat with thermostat, but experienced gardeners swear by
them. If the conditions under which you are growing plants from
seed do not provide a uniform temperature, or temperatures vary
greatly, a heating mat is worth investing in.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC3">HEATING CABLE </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Heating wire, soil cable</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Electrical wire, covered with lead and hooked
into a thermostat, that is plugged directly into a grounded
electrical outlet. </p>

<p>USE: Placed under soil in seed flats (above) to control the
temperature when starting delicate seedlings.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Though the wire is covered with lead to protect it
and you, you should be careful when digging near a heating cable
with metal tools. It is important that the heating cable be
attached to an electrical plug with a third prong for grounding,
and that this be plugged into a properly grounded outlet. Be sure
to note, if a grounding adapter is used, that the short green
wire is indeed screwed into the wall outlet. Be sure to bury the
thermostat in the ground.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: The less expensive heating cables have thermostats
that are part of the cable, while the more expensive ones have
thermostats that are separate from the cable. The latter is the
safer design.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC4">SEEDER</a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Row seeder</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Single wheel with a long handle and a large hub;
the hub contains a hopper and a release device for seeds.</p>

<p>USE: Sowing row crops. As you walk along your garden, the
seeder releases seeds at a preset rate, and you don't have to
bend over or kneel.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Be sure to set the rate and walk at the pace
necessary for proper dispersion of each kind of seed.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Reduces the need for thinning, and of course is
much faster than hand planting.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC5">THERMOMETERS</a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Dial or small mercury-filled tube with
calibrations in Centigrade or Farenheit degrees suitable for
indoor or outdoor use. Some are mounted alongside a barometer or <i>hygrometer</i>
or <i>humidistat</i> or <i>humidity meter </i>(for measuring
humidity). A <i>soil </i>or <i>garden thermometer</i>, a
specialized version with a long spike like a meat thermometer, is
made for measuring the temperature of compost piles (one brand is
called a <i>hot bed soil thermometer</i>, and it is over a foot
long.) A <i>minimum -maxium (</i>or<i> min/max) thermometer</i>
has markers, some that are reset by magnets, and is useful for
planting decisions. A special accessory is a <i>temperature alarm</i>
which you can set for minimum or maximum temperatures.</p>

<p>USE: Measuring air temperature; the soil thermometer measures
the soil temperature. Both help you avoid planting your vegetable
garden too early in the season. Humidistats help you maintain a
necessarily high level of humidity in your home or greenhouse.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Make sure you get one that is easy to read in
relation to where you intend to place it--on a greenhouse wall,
outside a window, or whatever. A &quot;must&quot; for
greenhouses.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC6">PLANT MARKERS </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Flower markers, plant labels</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Plastic, metal, or wooden stake just under a foot
long with flat area, about 1 x 3, inches which can be written
upon. Metal markers have one or two long wire prongs which are
stuck in the ground, with an angled top that has an etched zinc
band for writing upon with a special black carbon pencil.
Others,often called <i>pot labels</i> , are thin, flat plastic or
wood pieces from 4 to 12 inches long and 5/8 inches wide, angled
to a point for insertion in the soil; sometimes the longer ones
are called <i>garden stakes.</i></p>

<p>USE: Labeling plants, either as a marker of a freshly seeded
row of vegetables or to identify prize flowers. Also handy as a
reminder of when something was fertilized or treated with a
pesticide. Small wooden <i>pot labels</i> are good for seedling
pots.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Top quality metal markers are made of zinc.
Plastic may look good, but it is breakable. Wooden ones tend to
rot out in a season, and are more suitable to temporary jobs,
such as indicating where seeds have been planted.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC7">PLANTING LINE </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Length of cord with two stakes and a winding
mechanism, usually a reel. Many different lengths offered in the
range of 50 or 100 feet. Stakes made of metal, wood, or plastic.
Cord may be natural hemp or plastic coated. Line is often sold on
a convenient reel, like kite-flying string.</p>

<p>USE: Laying out a garden: this allows planting row crops in a
stright line.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Try not to use on moist soil and you'll have a
cleaner line.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC8">SEED-SPACING TEMPLATE </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Large, lightweight plastic sheet with large holes
in a regular pattern, such as every six inches.</p>

<p>USE: Placed over the ground, provides an accurate guide for
planting seeds in an exact pattern when they are planted through
the holes.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: If you don't mark where the edge of your template
falls, you will break your pattern when you move the template.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: It is just as easy to mark off measurements on a
line, or to make a similar item from a large sheet of cardboard
or a notched piece of wood.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC9">PLANTING CONTAINERS </a></h2>

<h2><a name="RTFToC10">ABOUT PLANTING CONTAINERS: </a></h2>

<p>Most garden centers devote a large area to planters, pots and
containers, made of clay, wood, plastic (many of recycled
plastic), metal, cement, and ceramics. Which material is best for
pots and planters depends primarily on personal taste. The most
notable point of comparison is this, though: The more porous the
material a pot or planter is made of, the more quickly the soil
or planting medium dries out. That is, if two pots are the same
size, one made of clay and the other of plastic, the soil in the
clay pot needs to be watered more often than the soil in the
plastic or glazed pot, although now some terracotta planters have
a self-watering feature, like many plastic ones. This is
particularly important when gardening in dry and hot places, like
roof gardens. And clay pots are harder to clean than plastic
pots. Still, the old debate over whether clay pots are better
than plastic ones remains unsettled for many gardeners. </p>

<p>Beyond their inherent qualities is the question of weight.
Outdoor pots and pots for larger plants must be heavy enough to
resist wind. Hanging plant pots need to be light. You may want to
put a heavy planter on a <i>plant dolly</i>, (or <i>plant caddy</i>
, <i>planter base,</i> or <i>coaster</i> ), a small platform with
four sturdy casters, so that it can be moved. </p>

<p>Remember that all planting pots must have drain holes so
excess water does not rot the plant's roots. You may want to use
a saucer to catch any water that flows out. Pot dimensions are
given as the diameter of the top, and sometimes the height as
well, though some dimensions are not given if the design is
extreme, such as with the flat planter used for forcing bulbs or
starting seedlings, called a <i>bulb pan.</i></p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC11">PLANT TRAYS </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Shallow, clear or colored plastic tray with ribs
and no drainage holes. <i>Window</i> or <i>windowsill trays</i>
are designed to fit on windowsills, and are therefore long and
narrow. Typically 20 or 22 inches long by 3-1/2 to 10 inches
wide. Usually sold with small aluminum brackets to hold them in
place.</p>

<p>USE: Supporting flower pots or other containers in a moist
environment when filled with gravel, sand, perlite, or
vermiculite. The gravel or other material holds a supply of water
away from the roots to prevent rot and to maintain high humidity.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Even in a greenhouse these are helpful, especially a
window greenhouse. Collect sand or rocks from a favorite vacation
spot and you'll have even more to enjoy.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Clear plastic for some reason is often more
expensive. Search out the thicker, stronger trays.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC12">WINDOW BOXES </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS:</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Rectangular planters made of metal, plastic,
wood, fiberglass, cast cement, terra cotta, or ceramic material.
Standard window boxes fit on or hang from a window sill, and are
as long as 3 feet and as wide and deep as 8 to 10 inches. Plastic
and metal window boxes come in an assortment of colors, though
green is the most common. Though not all boxes do, they should
have two or more1 inch drainage holes in the bottom, and feet to
create a gap under the holes.<b> </b>Redwood and cedar are the
most common woods used.</p>

<p>USE: Growing decorative annual plants outside of windows and
along balcony or porch railings.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Many wooden or plastic window boxes are sold without
drainage holes, but they should be drilled in the bottom before
being used (put the box on something to create a gap under the
box if it has no feet). Soil in window boxes dries out quickly,
so frequent watering is essential for most plants. Be sure to
place them where it is convenient to reach them for watering. A
soil mix high in <b>humus (Chapter 1)</b> holds moisture longer.
Metal boxes on sunny sills tend to heat up to dangerous levels,
harming plant roots. Treat any wood other than cedar or redwood
with a preservative that does not contain pentachlorophenol
(&quot;penta&quot;), such as Cuprinol. Special brackets are
available for holding window boxes onto railings or fences as
well as windows (below).</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Buy the deepest window boxes you can find (a
minimum of 10 inches deep is preferred) and that your space can
hold. The deeper the box, the longer it takes for the soil to dry
out. Even though you can drill holes in window boxes that do not
have them, it is better to buy boxes that already have drainage
holes. Color is an important consideration—many shades of green
clash with the natural green of plant foliage. Window boxes in
earth tones, if they go with the color of your house or
apartment, are often good choices. The lighter weight it is, the
easier it is to mount it outside of your window--no small
consideration. The only woods that hold up well to weathering are
redwood and cedar.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC13">Basket Planter </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Half or quarter sphere frames constructed from
concentric circles of wire connected by perpendicular wires, or
of solid plastic. Quarter-sphere models may be called <i>wall
baskets. or English hayrack flower baskets. </i>Other items that
do the same job with much charm are unglazed pottery faces and
other decorative shapes with one flat side that goes against a
wall.</p>

<p>USE: Lined with peat moss or other fibrous material and filled
with soil for hanging plant baskets. Quarter-sphere models hang
from a wall, like a picture. Solid materials, like plastic and
pottery, do not need a moss lining.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Fill the lined basket with a growing medium that
holds moisture well (one with a lot of humus). Plants can also be
placed through the wires from the outside, inserted into the peat
moss on the sides of the basket to produce a fuller planter,
usually a very striking effect.<b> </b>If possible, water by
submersing the basket completely, which gives it a really
thorough soaking.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Wire frames provide a suitable base for hanging
baskets, but only if you can supply ample water. Look for sturdy
construction, and if it is painted metal, an even, solid paint
job. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC1">HOOKS, HANGERS, AND BRACKETS </a></h2>

<p>TYPES:</p>

<p><i>Brackets</i></p>

<p><i>Ceiling hooks</i></p>

<p><i>Macram&#142;</i></p>

<p><i>Planter box brackets</i></p>

<p><i>Pulleys</i></p>

<p><i>S-hooks </i></p>

<p><i>Shelving</i></p>

<p><i>Track</i></p>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: </p>

<p><i>Planter box brackets: </i>Hangovers, window box brackets,
flower box brackets</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Many ingenious designs are available, and most
fall into the following categories. However, there are too many
odd ones to list, such as those which stick on windows, or hold
hanging plants. Be sure to browse through several displays and
ask for suggestions from the garden center if you aren't
satisfied with what you see. </p>

<p><i>Brackets: </i>Decorative L-shaped or scroll hook of various
sizes that is mounted on a wall and may be hinged. Some models
have a small scroll at the outward end in which you insert an
S-hook, while others have a swiveling hook built in. Some of the
best looking are made from wrought iron, though brackets are
found in all kinds of metal or wood in a wide range of prices.
They are adjustable to fit. Place pulleys at the base and tip,
and with a cord and a cleat, you can raise and lower a hanging
basket to your level, such as a wheelchair, or to a high ceiling.</p>

<p><i>Ceiling hooks:</i> Simple hook with a flanged base, like a
big cup hook, usually made of cast aluminum in a decorative style
(<i>swag hook</i>). <i>Swivel hooks</i> can rotate so the plant
can get sun on all sides; supplied with either a screw (for solid
ceilings) or a toggle bolt (a winged device for hollow ceilings).
Generally used with lightweight, decorative chain. Often sold in
plastic bubble packs. A special design of ceiling hook is made
for use on suspended ceilings. It slips over the thin metal
runners that hold the ceiling panels.</p>

<p><i>Macram&#142;: </i>Multiple strands of decorative woven rope
or yarn, ranging from 2 to 6 feet in length; the strands come
together at one or several points to hold potted plants. A metal
&quot;eye&quot; at the top provides for hanging from a nail or
hook. </p>

<p><i>Planter box brackets: </i>Sturdy metal arms which hook over
a deck, stair, or fence railing, or a window sill, to support a
planter or window box. Most are adjustable with a sliding
assembly to accomodate the width of the railing as well as the
width of the planter. They have a part which is adjusted to push
against even narrow uprights in a metal railing in order to hold
the box out. Models for direct attachment to a wall are
available, too. Smaller versions for holding round pots are also
available, called <i>hang-a-rounds. </i></p>

<p><i>Pulleys: </i>Grooved wheel that can be attached to a
ceiling.</p>

<p><i>S-hooks: </i>Wrought iron, plastic, or steel strand,
usually about 1/4 inch thick, in the form of an &quot;S&quot;.
Ranges in size from about an inch to half a foot.</p>

<p><i>Shelving: </i>Light-weight metal shelving, usually 3 or 4
shelves to a unit, about 36 inches long and high.</p>

<p><i>Track: </i>Long metal channel, about1 inch deep, in which
special hooks or eyes can slide; S-hooks or chain is hooked into
each one. </p>

<p>USE: Hanging or supporting plants in containers near windows
or on exterior walls.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Hangers with swivel devices make it easier to rotate
plants so that different sides are toward the light. Hooks and
hangers with pulley devices make it easier to lower heavy pots
and planters for watering and care. Measure your rails and
planters before purchasing support brackets.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Hardware stores and gift shops also carry
ingenious plant hanging items. Shop around.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC2">CERAMIC PLANTERS </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Cast terracotta in a wide range of sizes and
designs. Some have a vitreous glaze, adding an even wider range
of colors. Some are designed to hang on the wall. Some are fired
in such a way as to be frost proof, meaning they can be left out
over the winter.</p>

<p>USE: Typically used as an accent piece on a terrace, patio, or
in the home. </p>

<p>USE TIP: May add just the right focus to a deck or terrace, so
one or two are better than a whole collection.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Good quality ceramic planters, especially those
with beautiful decorative detail and a nice glaze, are more
expensive than other types, so choose carefully. Those with good
drainage are more desirable than those without, as it cannot be
added, though a layer of gravel can be placed in the bottom if
need be.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC3">FIBERGLASS PLANTERS </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Tubs</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Light weight containers in all kinds of shapes
and sizes from small urns to large tree containers. Many are
painted to look like wood, stone, or ceramic material. Some are
designed to match furniture or architectural detail.</p>

<p>USE: Substitute for heavier containers, especially where
weight is a consideration, such as on a roof or balcony. Will not
weather, chip, or peel. The great variety of design possibilities
makes these fit into specific decors unlike any other kind of
container.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Holes can be drilled in fiberglass planters if they
do not have them.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: What fiberglass container you should buy depends
largely upon your taste, need and ability to pay. Those which
most closely resemble wood or stone are usually more expensive.
Try to buy one with drainage holes.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC4">HALF WHISKEY BARRELS </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS:</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Literally a real wooden barrel cut in half,
actually used to make whiskey (or wine), though some are made as
planters now. All are made of hardwood staves or strips held
together with metal bands, about 2 1/2 feet in diameter at the
top, and slightly narrow at the bottom; about 2 feet deep. The
inside of the barrel often has been charred (burnt) as part of
the whiskey aging process. Sizes vary, but a typical big one
holds about 3 cubic feet of soil.</p>

<p>USE: Large planters, with a little preparation. Can also be
used to create a miniature water garden if the residual whiskey
or wine is thoroughly washed out first to avoid intoxication of
fish.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Whiskey barrels used for aging whiskey and wine must
be cleaned well with warm water and a stiff brush before they can
be used as planters or for miniature water gardens, but it is not
necessary to remove the charred section from the inside of the
barrel. The charred sides actually &quot;sweeten&quot; the soil
or water in the barrel--they absorb many unwelcome chemicals that
tend to build up in soil). The staves in the barrel swell when
wet, allowing the barrel to hold water for water gardening (lily
pads and goldfish--why not?), though it may take several days for
this to happen. If you are planing to use a whiskey barrel as a
planter, drill several 1/2 inch holes in the bottom for drainage
first. Because the metal bands that hold the staves in place are
not treated to prevent rust, it may be a good idea to paint them.
You can coat the inside with asphalt roofing cement if need be.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Look for half whiskey barrels that have not been
allowed to dry out and that has been stacked upside down. When a
whiskey barrel is over-dry the staves are not tight and the metal
bands become loose. Compare prices at different places, as the
markup can vary greatly. You should have to pay no more than
twenty-five dollars for a half whiskey barrel--remember, they are
discards from whiskey manufacturers. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC5">JARDINIERE</a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Decorative ceramic or stoneware jar that comes in
a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and colors. </p>

<p>USE: Covers houseplant containers. Not often used for outdoor
plants.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Few jardinieres have drainage holes, so plants should
not be planted directly in them but rather in containers, such as
plain pots, that fit easily inside the jardiniere. A layer of
gravel should be placed in the bottom which can act as a
reservoir for excess water underneath the plain pot. The
container holding the plant should never sit in water unless the
plant is a bog marginal (bog marginals are referred to as
&quot;plants that love wet feet&quot;).</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: A purchase determined by budget or aesthetic
considerations only.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC6">PLASTIC PLANTERS </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Commonly made of polyurethane and available in
almost any size and shape. Color range is wide, but a popular
color resembles terra-cotta. Many models, called <i>self-watering
</i>or<i> resevoir planters </i>or<i> pots, </i>are available
with a built-in resevoir for water in the bottom. This may be
internal and air-tight, or else a saucer-like attachment, with a
capillary or wick system that draws up the water as needed. The
better models have aeration ducts which maintain the proper
humidity level in the soil, and sensors which shut the water on
and off. <i>Hanging pots</i> are deep containers with attached
saucers and three wires and a hook for hanging.</p>

<p>USE: Any type of planting. Those that look like terra-cotta
are ideal for designs that call for this appearance, but where
weight is an issue, such as on roofs and balconies. Self-watering
planters are good for people who find it hard to water regularly,
with some models capable of going a month between waterings.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Plastic is not porous and soils and mediums in these
containers do not dry out as quickly as soil in a more porous
clay pot, an important consideration in hot, dry places. But
watch out for overwatering, the primary cause of houseplant
failure, if you don't have a self-watering model.</p>

<p>Soil should always be separated from water resevoirs by stones
or else the roots will rot. Add charcoal to the soil to keep it
from getting too smelly.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Plastic pots are often less expensive than the
fiberglass ones noted above. The choice of plastic pots is pretty
much up to your needs and taste, though color is an important
consideration. A good, thick layer of gravel in the bottom may
give a similar but less efficient effect as a more expensive
built-in resevoir. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC7">RED CLAY FLOWER POT </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: The quintessential flower pot, available in the
standard tapered shape, with a ridge about 1/5 of the way down
from the top, since time immemorial. The ridge indicates the
level to which it should be filled with soil. Size ranges from
tiny 2 inch deep pots to more than 3 feet deep. Standard model
clay pots are unglazed and unpainted, though glazed and painted
clay pots are available.</p>

<p>USE: Containers for houseplants or terrace or roof garden
plants. Often houseplants in clay pots are summered outside in
the garden or on the patio.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Because they are porous, the soil in clay pots dries
out more quickly than soil in less porous pots. Clay pots are the
only ones that &quot;breathe.&quot; Experienced gardeners know
when to water plants that are growing in clay pots by being
observant of the color of the pot. As the soil dries out, the
pots become lighter in color. Salts found in fertilizers and some
water sources may build up on clay pots, appearing as a white
chalky residue on the surface of the pot. If the pot is to be
reused, this salt should be scraped off and the pot washed in a
solution of warm water and chlorine bleach to remove other
bacteria and fungi that may be on or in the clay. Pots that are
kept wet develop algae which appears as a green film. Algae is
usually not harmful and can easily be washed off if the pot is
reused for another plant.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Clay pots may not necessarily be any better than
ones made from plastic or other materials, but they do seem to be
the choice of serious gardeners primarily because they absorb
excess water and thus help resist damage from overwatering. They
are less expensive than ceramic or stoneware pots and are
generally considered more earthy and attractive. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC8">STRAWBERRY POT </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Strawbery jar </p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Urn or jar with an open top and holes in the
sides. Most commonly made from unglazed fired red clay, but also
made from glazed stoneware or other materials such as plastic or
fiberglass. Size ranges from only 8 inches in height to as tall
as 3 feet. Another version is a redwood <i>patio tower </i>with
slats instead of holes, in either a slight pyramid or bookcase
style.</p>

<p>USE: Traditionally used for growing strawberries, but also
used to grow a miniature herb garden or a collection of
succulents or other small house plants including African violets
and miniature English ivy.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Strawberry jars should be planted in layers. Soil
should first be place in the pots up to the first holes, plants
then put in the holes, and soil added until the next level of
holes is reached. A cardboard collar or tube made from paper
towel rollers taped together should be placed in the center of
the pot and filled with small gravel such as is sold in pet
stores for lining bird cages or acquariums, before the pot is
filled with soil. The tube is removed when the pot is completely
filled and planted, leaving a gravel core through which the pot
can be uniformly watered. You may want to use soilless mixes
because they are lighter, and put this planter on rollers so you
can rotate it to give all sides some sun.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: The material to choose is strictly a matter of
personal preference. Glazed stoneware pots are usually more
expensive. Hand thrown, unglazed, Italian clay strawberry pots
are common and often not expensive.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC9">WOODEN TUBS AND CONTAINERS </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Redwood planters, cedar planter</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Rectangular or octagonal containers, usually held
together by metal bands and sometimes lined with plastic or
galvanized tin. Available in a variety of sizes from flower pot
size to large tubs that can hold a tree or shrub. Made of
rot-resistant redwood, cedar, teak, or treated pine or other
softwoods.</p>

<p>USE: Attractive, natural-looking containers for plants and
shrubs. A carefully chosen collection of wooden containers on a
terrace can give continuity to the overall design.</p>

<p>USE TIP: If a wooden planter is not lined, a heavy plastic
garbage bag can be placed on the inside in order to slow down the
decay of the wood (be sure to put drainage holes in the plastic
liner). If the planter does not have drainage holes, drill some
before planting. Even a rot-resistant redwood planter can have
its useful life doubled by using a plastic liner. Unlined wooden
planters tend to dry out more quickly than lined or solid
containers.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Wooden containers have an insulating value which
keeps soil from drying out as fast as it does in other types of
containers. Look for lined planters with drainage holes. Avoid
those treated with toxic preservatives such as used on decks (CCA
is the most common) but if you must, get one that is treated for
contact with the ground. And never even bother with creosoted
wood--it is toxic to plants. The best planters are made of
disease and rot-resistant redwood or cedar. While teak is an
excellent material for the construction of wooden planters, much
of it is from the commercial harvest of naturally grown teak
which is destructive to tropical rain forests. Gardeners in
particular should be concerned about this and avoid purchasing
teak products that are produced from wild teak; look for teak
labeled as grown in managed forests. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC10">STAKES, SUPPORTS, AND FENCING </a></h2>

<p>There is no such thing as just plain &quot;fencing&quot;--all
types have their specific functions. Some are used to keep pest
animals at bay, and are noted in Chapter 4. Others are used for
defining areas or for shade, and are noted below.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC11">PLANT STAKES </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Long thin pieces of bamboo, hardwood, or steel
tubing covered with PVC, ranging in size from small pencil
diameters to 1 inch thick and from 2 to 8 feet long. Wooden and
bamboo stakes may be either painted or unpainted. Usually sold in
packages or bundles of 10 to 25, sometimes including an
assortment of mixed sizes. <i>Tree stakes</i> are either of two
kinds: 6 feet long and 2 to 3 inch thick pieces of rot-resistant
cedar, or else sturdy 1 foot stakes, much like tent stakes. Both
are used with <i>guy wires</i> (lengths of galvanized steel wire)
that are wrapped around the trunk with a rubber sleeve for
protection. Rough-textured<i> </i>natural<i> fernwood poles,</i>
made from the roots of large ferns, are also available. These are
a few inches in diameter and 18 to 36 inches long. Fernwood is
also available in a variety of cut forms such as slabs, totems,
and pots.</p>

<p>USE: Holding up plants and shrubs. Tree stakes keep newly
planted trees from blowing over in high winds before their roots
are established. Fernwood poles are used for houseplants.</p>

<p>USE TIP: When tying plants to a stake, secure the tie or twist
to the stake before tying it to the plant. This prevents the tie
from slipping down the stake. Especially with vegetable crops
like tomatoes, it is important that the tie be loose around the
plant's stem. If it is too tight, the plant will strangle as it
grows. Use natural fiber string or twine to tie the plants.
String or twine made from synthetic material will not decompose
if left in the garden, and is harder to work with.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Determine how you are going to use the stakes and
whether you will be using them for many years or not. If what you
need the stakes for is a temporary job, buy the cheaper bamboo
stakes. If you are planning to use the stakes for several years,
the more expensive PVC covered steel tubing is worth the extra
money. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC1">WALL ANCHOR </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Vine hanger, vine support, vine nail, wall
nail, garden wall tie</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Extra-sturdy 1-1/4 inch nail (a masonry nail)
with a soft lead arm, or clip, about an inch or two long. Another
version is a small fiber disk with a 2 inch long wire tongue,
supplied with a tube of weatherproof adhesive. The simplest
version is a long steel wedge with a hole in the wide end, called
a <i>vine eye. </i>Another type of holding pin for vines and
climbing plants is the <i>pole pin</i>, a sturdy, long U-shaped
pin which is designed to be pushed into soft wood.</p>

<p>USE: Holding up vines or other climbing plants on masonry or
wooden walls.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Bend holding arm before attaching to wall. Make sure
you follow adhesive directions, leaving a thick pad of it between
the wall and the anchor.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC2">ANCHOR </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Short stakes made of wood, metal or plastic,
designed to be driven into the ground with a mallet or hammer.</p>

<p>USE: Holding down plastic sheeting, whether for landscape
fabric used as <b>mulch (Chapter 2)</b> or <b>row covers (below),</b>
as well as <b>protective netting (Chapter 4).</b></p>

<p>USE TIPS: Drive in deeply for extra holding strength and
shield exposed end with rocks or potted plants to limit the
chance of someone tripping on the stake. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC3">PLANT SUPPORTS </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Cage, hoops, perrenial supports, flower
supports, flower support rings, border supports </p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Rust-resistant or plastic-coated wire hoops,
loops, or grids with vertical wire legs, or stakes, of various
designs: <i>Peony supports</i> are single or double wire hoops
attached to heavy vertical wires 24 or 35 inches long, making a
cylinder. Others have a large, round grid, or frame, over the top
which the stems go through as they grow--they are often called <i>grow-through
flower supports.</i> Another version has just a single stake with
a small loop at the top, called <i>Blossom </i>or<i> Bulb
supports, or Loop-stakes.</i>. And some, <i>link</i> - or<i>linking
stakes</i>, are just straight wire pieces available in three
lengths from about 1 to 3 feet, that are linked together as the
gardener wishes, custom-designed for each plant or garden. <i>Tuteurs</i>
(French for &quot;tutors&quot;) are 6 foot high supports for
vines amd climbing plants. All are usually dark green and
available in a small range of sizes.</p>

<p>USE: Holding up top-heavy plants that have a tendency to flop
over, whether due to their own weight or heavy winds and rain. <i>Blossom</i>
or <i>bulb supports</i> are obviously for single, top-heavy
flowers. The <i>round plant support</i>, or grid, is more
suitable to taller perrenials. </p>

<p>USE TIP: Place the supports over the plants just as they start
to grow. Push the vertical wire in the ground around the plant so
that it is centered in the hoop or hoops. Note that it is darn
hard to push a full grown plant with large blooms through a small
opening, so put supports out when the plant is beginning to grow,
not afterward.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Peony supports are not very expensive at under $2
for a single hoop and under $3 for a double hoop, although a
homemade version using chicken wire is a good alternative, and it
doesn't show that much. The chicken wire (about 1 foot square) is
placed over the plant just as it starts to grow and is raised
with the plant. Linking stakes are the most versatile. Look for
strong wire and smooth coatings. Though more expensive than tying
plants, this is a lot easier. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC4">TOMATO CAGE </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Tomato stake cage</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Rust-resistant metal or plastic frame, 48 or 54
inches high, shaped like a cone, with the larger end of the cone
on the top, or as a straight cylinder or rectangle. Four or five
concentric wire rings are held together by four vertical metal
wires. Some makes are pieces of large wire mesh which form 18
inch cylinders.</p>

<p>USE: Supports tomato and other fruiting plants, eliminating
the task of staking and tying.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Cages should be placed over the plants shortly after
they have been transplanted into the garden, before they become
to big to be easily caged.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Unless you grow hundreds of tomatoes, cages are
not an expensive purchase. They can be used for many years and
are much easier to use than stakes and ties.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC5">ALUMINUM SPIRAL TOMATO STAKE </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Thick wire spiral with straight pointed end, 5
1/2 feet tall and 1/2 inch in diameter, which can be stuck in the
ground near a tomato plant.</p>

<p>USE: Holding tomater plants upright without tying: they grow
through the tunnel that is created by the spiral. </p>

<p>USE TIP: Keep sucker growth (buds and stems that appear
between the main stem and a branch) pruned. Sucker growth not
only saps the strength of the plant, but can create a bushier
plant than this type of stake is designed to accommodate.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: These are more expensive than other types of
stakes. Try one out before deciding whether you want to use it
for all your tomato plants.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC6">PLANT TIES </a></h2>

<p>POPULAR BRAND NAME: Twist-ems</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Thin wire sandwiched inside a 1/4 inch wide
paper, usually green. sold in reels ranging from a few feet to
250 feet long as well as in packages of pre-cut pieces about 6 or
8 inches long. Alternatives include soft, natural <i>jute twine </i>(green
or natural beige color)<i>, vinyl ribbon, nylon loops, </i>and<i>
foam-coated, cushioned wire, </i>some of which stretch as the
plant grows. Most can be found in the color green.</p>

<p>USE: Temporary and gentle holding of plants against supports
and stakes.</p>

<p>USE TIPS:</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS:</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC7">TRELLIS NETS </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Plastic netting designed to be strung beteen
poles or posts. </p>

<p>USE: Temporary trellis for climbing vegetable crops such as
cucumbers, beans, and peas. Reduces the amount of space needed in
the garden. They also make harvesting from vines easier.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Place poles and posts that are used to support nets
close enough together to support the weight of the crops.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Gardeners in the past made their own net vegetable
trellises by stringing twine between upright poles. Plastic net
trellises simplify this task, and they can be used for many years
more than twine. Make sure the net you are buying can support the
weight of the crop that you wish to grow on it. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC8">RIGID PLANT TRELLISES </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Sold in a variety of shapes including the old
fashioned <i>fan trellis</i>, a wider-bottomed <i>flair trellis</i>,
a rectangular <i>ladder</i> design, and the diamond grid trellis,
also called <i>lattice</i>. Made of aluminum, plastic, fiberglass
or wood. An <i>arbor</i> (or <i>trellised arch</i>) is sort of a
three-dimensional trellis that spans a walk like a free-standing
doorway or arch, and a <i>tunnel</i> is a longer version, each
size made longer by adding a hoop for as much as 20 feet . <i>Bean
and pea towers </i>are merely 6 feet long stakes bunched together
at the top like a skinless teepee. An <i>A-frame</i> trellis is
two 5 x 8 foot metal frames with a large mesh nylon net, and a
similar rigid trellis is made of large panels that unfold like a
Japanese screen.</p>

<p>USE: Supporting climbing or vining plants that cannot adhere
to a wall. In some cases you may not want vines on the wall (thus
avoiding harm) or in other cases the trellis may create a natural
wall. Allows you to harvest vegetables without bending over.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Be sure that the trellis is well secured,
particularly when using woody or heavy vines. Excellent for those
who have trouble reaching ground level, such as wheelchair-bound
or elderly gardeners.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP:</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC9">border fencinG </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Trim fence, bed guard, folding fence, flower
border</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Small, decorative fence made of welded, platic
coated or enameled wire, or of wooden pickets. Vinyl coated in
green or white. Commonly sold in 8, 10, and 12 foot lengths
folded by sections, or in 20 foot and 25 foot rolls, 8 to 32
inches high, and in a variety of styles, such as round tops,
angular tops, or gothic tops. Picket patterns usually have model
names like &quot;Colonial&quot; or &quot;Cape Cod.&quot; Wooden
lattice panels also available. Also available 36 or 48 inches
high version, called a lawn guard.</p>

<p>Larger welded wire fences are available with large mesh and
fence posts in 36 and 48 inch high models, sold in 50 foot rolls.
<i>Hex netting</i>, or <i>poultry netting</i> or <i>chicken wire</i>,
is available in 50 and 150 foot rolls 24, 36, and 48 inches wide
of light gauge galvanized, woven wire. <i>Diamond mesh</i> is
available galvanized or vinyl coated, usually with a 2-1/2 inch
woven mesh made of14 gauge wire, in 50 foot rolls 36 or 48 inches
high--it looks like the much stronger <i>chain link fences. </i>Welded
mesh is has square openings in various sizes including 1/2 x 1
inch, 1 x1 inch, 2 x 1 inch, and 4 x 2 inches and is available in
36 and 48 inch heights sold in rolls 50 foot and 100 feet long. </p>

<p>USE: Marking off flower beds and protecting them from people,
pets, and lawn mowers.</p>

<p>USE TIP: If placed near a popular short cut, try to notice if
people are tripping on the fence rather than going around it. If
so, replace with a higher fence.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Avoid untreated pine fencing, as it will rot after
just one year in the soil. Welded fencing is stronger than woven
fencing, and wire fence material that is galvanized after welding
is better protected against the elements.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC10">edging</a></h2>

<p>POPULAR BRAND NAMES: Easy-Edge, Sure edge</p>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Plastic border, landscape border, grass stop,
grass edging, lawn edging, border edging, bed divider, lawn
border</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Several different types. Semi-rigid polyethylene
or aluminum sheet, 4 to 6 inches high, with a tubular edge on the
plastic version, driven into the ground vertically, with the
tubular edge of the plastic version left just at the surface (a
small &quot;L&quot; on the bottom edge keeps the plastic from
coming back up). Plastic available in black, white, green, or
redwood color, sold in rolls of 20 and 100 feet Also available in
6 inch and 12 inch high scalloped cedar slabs in 10 and 20 foot
sections or 3 inch diameter <i>pegs</i> or <i>logs</i> 4-1/2 to
10 inches high, joined by wire or rubber sheet in 3 foot
sections. Still other types are made of pressure-treated pine
(with a green/gray color) with decorative picket tops, or fake
plastic &quot;pegs&quot;. Better brands have a &quot;T&quot; or
flared bottom to keep it from coming out.</p>

<p>USE: Making borders of flower beds and lawns. A particularly
good way to keep creeping grass out of perennial beds and off of
walks.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Push metal or plastic in slowly so it does not
buckle. Edging should be in the soil deep enough to block roots
and for a lawn mower to pass over it.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Black plastic edging with the tubular top replaces
green metal (and other forms of plastic edging) and is
considerably more durable. Some brands are guaranteed for 20
years. Avoid promotionally priced lightweight metal edging, as it
is likely to bend when it is being installed.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC11">SHADE Fencing </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Snow fencing, shading fence</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Small, 3/8 inch thick wooden boards, called <i>lath</i>,
3 to 6 feet long by about 1inch wide bound together with several
rows of wire, twisted on both side of each lath. Often painted
red or maroon. Sold in rolls of 50 feet. A similar type of
protective fencing is woven from thin, chemically treated
freshwater reeds, called <i>reed fencing. </i>It comes in 6 foot
rolls 15 and 25 feet long.</p>

<p>USE: Breaks wind a bit to control drifting of snow and sand.
Also a simple wind break for small shrubs and trees--an
application particularly useful in areas where the winter winds
can be damaging. Can also be used to shade newly planted
seedlings or hardwood cuttings.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP:</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC12">PROTECTIVE MATERIALS AND SEASON EXTENDERS </a></h2>

<h2><a name="RTFToC13">Burlap</a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Wind shield, windbreak, plant protector</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Loosely woven, light brown cloth traditionally
made from natural jute fiber. Sold in square sheets from 20 x 20
inches to 120 x 120 inches or in rolls up to 125 yards long and
in widths of 36, 40, 48, or 60 inches, called <i>continuous
burlap</i>. May be treated (to prevent rot) or untreated.
Packages of squares may be called <i>totes</i>. Plastic version
is also available, though only in squares and short rolls. <i>Erosion
cloth</i> is a term sometimes used to refer to a wide (or
&quot;open&quot;) mesh, lightweight version. Available also in 8
to 12 foot squares with grommets in each corner and reinforced
edges for use as a leaf carrier.</p>

<p>USE: Rolled burlap is used to construct wind shields to
protect sensitive plants from cold, damaging, winter winds and
snow. Sheets are used to wrap root and soil balls when
transplanting or moving woody shrubs and trees. Smaller sheets,
about 8 by 8 feet , can be used for carrying large loads of raked
leaves or other garden debris. Erosion cloth is used for erosion
control in newly seeded lawns, especially on gentle slopes and
embankments. </p>

<p>USE TIP: When wrapping root balls, wet the soil around the
plant well to keep the soil in a compact ball. Be sure to use
natural twine to bind a natural burlapped root ball, so that it
decomposes after planting. Most burlaps products, especially the
lightweight version, disintegrate naturally after one
season--considered an advantage by most users. Do not use as a
duster: the dust will go all over, not as directed, and is likely
to pose a hazard to you.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Natural burlap is easier to use as it is more
pliable than plastic, which does not allow plant roots to breathe
and does not decompose in the ground. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC1">CLOCHE</a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Season extender, plant protector, teepee, plant
cover</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Plastic, glass, or fabric cone which is placed
over a single plant, several plants or an entire row of plants in
a garden. Similar in theory to a<b> cold frame (below)</b>, but
portable, like a miniature cold frame or greenhouse. Light passes
through the material so that the green leaves can still
photosynthesize. Many ingenious designs are available, from
galvanized wire mesh covered with plastic to paper on wire hoops,
as well as the familiar molded or formed plastic. A newer kind is
a set of interconnected clear plastic tubes which are filled with
about 3 gallons of water, forming a ribbed cone (brand name:
Wall-O-Water). The water retains heat from the day and releases
it at night, acting as a temperature moderator and insulator.</p>

<p>USE: Protects young and tender crops during the early (and
late) season when you might get caught by a late (or early)
frost, and from cold winds. It is also used to extend the season
into the cooler weather in the fall. Crops such as tomatoes,
peppers, and other transplants can get a head start when a cloche
is placed over them.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Be sure to remove the cloche when the day
temperatures are particularly warm (75<sup>o</sup> F +), as the
plants may heat up too much. Replace the cloche when the
temperatures begin to drop.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: If you plan on using cloaches for several years,
buy a higher- priced fabric or solid plastic one which will last,
and store carefully between seasons. It will be worth the
investment.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC2">ROSEBUSH PROTECTOR </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Winterizer, plant protector, season extender,
rose collar</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Two basic types: one solid and one open. The
solid one is a styrofoam plastic cone about 1-1/2 feet high that
resembles a large wastebasket with a flange. Stakes (supplied)
are driven through holes in the flange to hold the cone down. The
open one is fiberglass screening or corrugated plastic which
forms a cylinder a foot high and from 1 to 1-1/2 feet in
diameter. It is filled with a light, insulating mulch, such as
peat moss, peanut shells, or the like. </p>

<p>USE: Protecting rose bushes from winter weather extremes, or
extending the growing season for vegetables that are planted
early in the spring.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Prune carefully first. Clean and store properly to
get long life out of your protectors.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC3">COLD FRAME </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Essentially a miniature greenhouse consisting of
an open pit dug in the ground up to 2 feet deep by about 3 or 4
feet long and wide, with a wooden (rot-resistant redwood most
often), plastic (polycarbonate), or aluminum frame around the
sides and a hinged glass or clear plastic top. Some models come
with themostatically controled tops that automatically open when
the temperature reaches a certain point, or other automatic
venting systems, or it can a simple homemade job.</p>

<p>USE: Allows you to winter over tender plants as well as to
start and protect seedlings in the spring. Can double during the
summer as a small compost bin when it is not being used for
plants.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Cold frames should be opened when the day
temperatures begin to climb, otherwise you risk a premature
cooking of the plants within. Watch out that you don't drop the
top and break the glass; plastic glazing is advantageous in this
respect.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Cold frames are so easy to make that most people
(even those who are not handy) can put one together in an
afternoon using scrap lumber and old windows. However, the
polycarbonate ones sold commercially are excellent--they even
insulate a bit--and won't break if you drop the tops or
accidently step on them when chasing an errant shuttlecock or
baseball. Look for ones with wind-protected vents.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC4">ROW COVER </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Fabric row cover, floating row cover</p>

<p>POPULAR BRAND NAME: Reemay</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Essentially a sort of<b> coldframe (above)</b>
brought to the plants instead of the other way around.
Lightweight, transluscent, spun-bonded polyester material between
5 and 6 feet wide and 250 to 2550 feet long. Sunlight and water
penetrate easily (75% of sunlight). Some are slitted.</p>

<p>USE: Protects seedlings from animals, flying pests, and season
extremes (early spring and late fall) to a certain extent, while
still allowing light and water to enter. Also helps retain
moisture and heat in a seed bed.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Support with some kind of light framework or stakes.
Though the manufacturer claims that it is so light it can be
placed loosely over new plants or seedbed, letting the plants
push this material up as they grow, tender seedlings might not be
strong enough to do this and could get damaged. Remove the fabric
once the seedlings are established to avoid heating up the bed
too much.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC5">Shade Fabric </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Loosely woven black polypropylene fibers sold in
6 foot rolls in lengths up to 300 feet . It is graded according
to density, ranging from 30 to 92% (commonly 53%,63% and 73%),
which indicates the amount of shade it provides. Price varies
accordingly, with the densest costing roughly twice as much per
square foot as the most open. Rot-proof, mildew-proof, UV ray-
resistant, chemical-resistant. <i>Shading compound</i> is a
concentrated paint that is used on glass greenhouses to temper
the sunlight. A different kind of compound is used on plastic. <i>Greenhouse
film</i> is UV resistant plastic sheeting, 14 to 40 feet wide,
sold in 100 foot rolls, used for the same purpose; it is secured
with staples and <i>greenhouse tape, </i>an adhesive tape
specially formulated for this purpose.</p>

<p>USE: Primarily for shading tender new seedlings and
transplants but also for covering a planting bed where cuttings
are rooting.</p>

<p>USE TIP: It is easier to install above a planting bed if it is
attached to a wooden frame.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: As with many products sold by the roll, larger
ones are cheaper per foot to buy. Look for shade fabric which is
U.V. tested, as this indicates that it does not break down under
sunlight. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC6">STEEL MESH TREE PROTECTOR </a></h2>

<p>Popular Brand Names: Tree Tender </p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Stainless steel mesh, soft and flexible, which is
sold in small pieces 2-3/8 inches by 7-1/2 feet. Secured with
clips supplied by the manufacturer. Can be cut to fit. Another
version is made of sturdy foam rubber.</p>

<p>USE: One layer protects against rodent damage; multi-layered
wrap protects bark from string trimmer and mower damage. The open
weave permits natural ventilation but discourages insect larvae
development. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC7">Tree Wrap </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Tree paper</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Waterproof paper, plastic fiber, vinyl, foam
rubber, or burlap in widths from 3 to 6 inches, sold in rolls of
100 or l50 feet in the case of woven goods. Plastic items may be
spirals in 2 and 3 foot lengths. Paper type is dark brown kraft
paper sandwiching a layer of weatherproof asphalt and given a
&quot;crepe&quot; finish.</p>

<p>USE: Wound in a spiral around the bottom six feet or so of
small trees' trunks. Protects trees, especially young, newly
planted trees, from damage by insects, pets, deer, rabbits, and
weather (sun scald or early frost), as well as from loss of
moisture.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Paper and natural fiber burlap is easier to use than
synthetic material, which when used as a tight fabric wrap does
not expand as the tree grows, and if not removed, will constrict
the tree. Tie with jute twine, which will rot off over time and
not harm the tree as it grows. Solid plastic spirals should be
avoided as they neither breathe nor decompose. Trees with
lenticles (breathing pores) located on the trunk and branches can
suffer from plastic tree wrap.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC8">TREE TUBE </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Tree guard</p>

<p>POPULAR BRAND NAMES: Ross Tree Gard, Clark's Weed Whacker
Guards </p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Plastic tube slit along the side, sold in 36 inch
lengths.</p>

<p>USE: Snaps onto trunks of young trees to protect them from
insect and animal damage as well as from excessive sun, like tree
wrap, above, but plastic, because it is stiff, also protects
street trees from minor bike or dog abuse, and is particularly
good winter protection. A new specialty model only 6 inches high
has been developed for protecting against nylon string <b>trimmers
(Chapter 7)</b>.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Remember to remove tubing as the tree grows too big
for it, although one advantage to slit tube or spirals is that
they expand easily with the growth of the tree.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP:</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC9">TREE SUPPORT KIT </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Collection of 3 18 inch hardwood stakes, 3 12
inch rubber sleeves (probably sections of old hose), and 30 feet
of heavy galvanized wire. Others may include 6 foot cedar stakes
instead, usually in urban areas.</p>

<p>USE: Holding newly-planted tree upright without damaging it. </p>

<p>USE TIPS: Wrap wire around stakes securely so that it really
holds the tree if tension is placed on it. Use the hose to
protect the tree from damage. Flag stakes to prevent people from
tripping over them. Remove after one year.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC1">PERSONAL AND MISCELLANEOUS GEAR AND
EQUIPMENT </a><br>
<a name="RTFToC2">PROTECTIVE CLOTHING AND GEAR </a></h2>

<h2><a name="RTFToC3">ABOUT PROTECTIVE GEAR: </a></h2>

<p>As tame as it may appear to be, gardening is not without its
dangers. Power tools, tools with sharp edges or blades, and toxic
chemicals are some of the things that can be hazardous to the
gardener who does not consider safety when using them. Many of
the items listed below as personal gear are in fact safety items,
designed to protect the gardener from harm. On the other hand,
some are designed to make the gardener's job easier, or to help
infirm or elderly gardeners get around an uncomfortable job. Both
kinds of personal gear are important.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC4">ABOUT SAFETY ITEMS: </a></h2>

<p>Here is not the place to sacrifice quality for price. Be sure
the items you are buying meet your own rigid standards for fit
and function, and look for labels of government approval as well,
such as OSHA or ANSI (Occupational Safety and Health
Administration or American National Standards Institute). </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC5">PROTECTIVE GOGGLES </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Safety goggles, eye protectors</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Oversized plastic glasses with covered sides,
large enough to fit over regular glasses, with rubber or elastic
headbands that hold them in place. The side pieces also have vent
holes to prevent the goggles from fogging up, though some goggles
are now made of plastic that resists fogging.</p>

<p>USE: Protect eyes from dust or flying particles of wood, grit,
stone or any other object that could damage the eyes. They are to
be worn when using most power tools, such as chipper/shredders,
string or blade type weed cutters, as well as large cutting tools
such as axes and hatchets. </p>

<p>USE TIP: Goggles should be kept clean for better visibility.
Certain power tools kick up so much debris that the goggles can
become dangerously clogged, actually blinding you as they protect
and actually causing an accident.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Safety goggles are an essential gardening item if
you use axes or power tools. Try them on to insure a comfortable
fit. Wear them for a few minutes to see if they fog up, and don't
buy them if they do. Goggles should protect from dust and dirt as
well as impact. If you wear glasses, get a pair of goggles that
are large enough to fit over them. There is no question that
protection of your eyes is worth spending money on. Don't worry
about finding great bargains here.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC6">RESPIRATORS &amp; DUST MASKS </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: </p>

<p><i>Respirator:</i> Breathing mask, gas mask</p>

<p><i>Dust mask: </i>Pinch mask, painter's mask (incorrect and
misleading)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Respirators are heavy-duty rubberized plastic
devices that are strapped to the head and fit over the mouth and
nose. A round filter cartridge is on each side. Some models,
called &quot;full-face&quot; models, have a face shield that
covers the entire face. Government specifications for whatever it
can filter out are clearly indicated on the filter package. Dust
masks are only a few inches wide, fit loosely over the mouth and
nose and are held by a thin rubber band around the head. Made of
compressed paper fibers, and usually white, a thin metal strip
above the nose section of the masks is pinched tight for a more
secure fit around the nose. The term &quot;painter's mask&quot;
is incorrect and misleading. They generally do not protect
against spray paint. Also available are slightly heavier plastic
or rubber masks, roughly triangular in form, are available into
which you insert small replacement filters; they provide a
slightly snugger fit around the mouth and nose. Only a few makes
are government approved.</p>

<p>USE: Respirators are used to filter out fine dust, mists, and
toxic vapors, depending on the filter type. This kind of
professional, quality respirator is essential if you are using
very toxic chemicals; be certain to check the specifications of
filter cartridges. Clean and change filters after use. Dust masks
are used to block out larger dusts and powders, but they do not
filter out toxic vapors or mists. PAPER DUST MASKS ARE DISPOSABLE
AND MUST BE DISCARDED AFTER EACH USE.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: All masks must fit properly in order to do any good
at all. Every gardener should keep good quality paper dust masks
on hand to wear when mixing soils, working with milled peat, and
particularly for mixing soiless mixes. When these are worked,
small particles become airborne and can cause respiratory
problems if breathed in. Dust masks can be purchased in packages
containing a dozen or more, encouraging the use of clean masks
for each job. </p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Depending upon the type of gardening you do and
your exposure to toxic fumes, a respirator may not be necessary,
but they are easily available these days and not too expensive.
It seems a worthwhile investment in your health, even if used
rarely. Dust masks, however, are inexpensive essentials. You must
match the respirator to the job at hand. Filter cartridges are
marked by capacity for dusts, mists, vapors, or fumes. Look for
government approval, from either NIOSH or MSHA (National
Institute of Safety and Health, and Mine Safety and Health
Administration, respectively) or both. If your local garden
center cannot provide these items, check the Yellow Pages under
Safety Equipment or Indutrial Supplies.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC7">EAR PROTECTORS </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Ear muffs, hearing protectors</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Similar to large audio headphones: two
semi-spherical cups that are sound-insulated and foam-lined for
easy fit. They fit over the ears and are held in place by a
plastic or metal band that is worn over the top of the head. </p>

<p>USE: Prevent damage to the ears from the noise of power tools.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Gasoline powered tools such as lawn mowers,
gas-powered string trimmers, chipper/shredders, generators for
hedge trimmers, rotary tillers, and chain saws are particularly
noisy and can cause damage to the ears. Ear protectors should be
worn when using these tools and machines. Keep your eyes open for
possible warnings from other people, because you won't be able to
hear them. </p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Try on ear protectors to test for comfortable fit
and to test the level of noise they absorb.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC8">HARD HAT </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Safety hard cap</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Metal or reinforced plastic caps with a short bib
visor in the front and a web lining. Available with transparent
face shields (either plastic sheet or metal mesh) or ear
protectors, in which case may be called a <i>safety helmut.</i></p>

<p>USE: Protecting your head during overhead tree pruning or
major clearing projects.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Adjust headband for snug fit.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Though not a standard item for all gardeners, it
is a recommended item if you do a lot of heavy pruning. If you
find that your are wearing a hard hat with your goggles and ear
protectors, you may wish to look for hats that have these
features built in. Consider the temperature when buying a hat
with a face visor—a wire mesh face shield is cooler than a solid
plastic one. Many different makes are available. Look for one
that meets ANSI standards, the government test. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC9">COMFORT AND CONVENIENCE ITEMS </a><br>
<a name="RTFToC10">KNEE PROTECTORS </a></h2>

<p>TYPES:</p>

<p><i>Kneepads</i></p>

<p><i>Kneeling pads</i></p>

<p><i>Kneeling bench</i></p>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: <i>Kneeling bench: </i>Kneeler stool,
bench/kneeler, garden stool</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Several products are sold which protect the knees
from damage while gardening:</p>

<p><i>Kneepads: </i>Shallow rubber cups that fit directly over
the knee and are held in place by straps that go around the leg.
Sold in different weights and densities. &quot;Sponge vinyl&quot;
is a popular material description.</p>

<p><i>Kneeling pads: </i>Rectangular foam rubber pads about
9&quot; by 18.&quot; Most have a elliptical hole which serves as
a handle for carrying.</p>

<p><i>Kneeling bench: </i>A combination bench and kneeling pad
design, this has become quite popular in recent years. Consists
of a tubular metal frame about 20&quot; high which supports a
padded seat about 20&quot; wide. When the bench is positioned as
such, it is a comfortble, portable seat. When it is turn
&quot;upside down,&quot; with the seat near the ground, it
becomes a kneeling pad with high handles for assisting the
gardener get up and down. A bench of a similar design is
available with wheels, for scooting along as you garden.</p>

<p>USE: Reducing the pain of kneeling. The kneeling bench is
particularly helpful to elderly gardeners and all those who have
difficulty kneeling and bending.</p>

<p>USE TIP: It is probably a good idea to protect your knees even
if you have no knee problem. Whether using a pad or not, stand up
and stretch often while gardening.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Rubber knee pads are convenient because they are
attached to you and don't have to be carried around, but many
gardeners complain about the slight discomfort caused by the
strap that holds them on. The more expenisve models, with their
heavier, denser material, tend to be worth it. Cheaper ones that
don't work well make you pay with real discomfort. (One
alternative is a homemade solution: make large pockets for
sponges on the knees of your gardening pants. Ready-made pants
like this are available mail-order.) Foam kneeling pads are
light, inexpensive, and easy to use, but they have to be moved
each time you move. The kneeling bench is more expensive but its
combination design makes it versatile. It is particularly
attractive to elderly or arthritic gardeners, who find kneeling
and bending difficult. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC11">LAWN TWEEZERS </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Light weight aluminum tongs about a yard long
with a hinge near the end. Plastic hand grips.</p>

<p>USE: Picking up litter without bending over or leaving a
wheelchair.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC12">L HOLSTER </a></h2>

<p>TYPES:</p>

<p><i>Sheath</i></p>

<p><i>Scabbard</i></p>

<p><i>Utility belt </i></p>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: <i>Utility belt: </i>Tool belt</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Leather or canvas pouch that attaches to a belt,
or in the case of a utility belt, a wide leather belt with hooks
and compartments that goes over a regular belt. </p>

<p>USE: Keeping frequently used tools close at hand when not in
use, especially knives, hatchets, pruning shears, and tree saws.
Particularly useful for tools that are used throughout the
garden, such as pruning shears, or those used when you are on a
ladder.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Small items like pruning shears and pruning knives
are less likely to be lost if they are placed in a sheath worn on
the belt. Can be considered a safety item if you are working from
a ladder.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Though most gardeners have no need for a heavy
utility belt, any gardener with pruning shears and pruning knives
will find the purchase of a quality holster a good investment.
Look for well-sewn seams that are also riveted, and expect to pay
between five and ten dollars for a good one. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC13">TOOL HANGERS </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Tool hooks</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Small steel tubing and brackets of various
designs. Longer brackets may have small balls welded on to keep
tools apart. Some are designed to fit into the holes of Pegboard
while others are clip-like devices which slide over the top of a
board which is in turn anchored to a wall. Another type, best for
smaller tools, is a metal grid with specially made hooks. A
popular design is a loop of tubular steel with both ends pointing
out and up; it is attached to the wall at the center (a smaller
version is merely a piece of stamped metal with two hooks). And
for larger tools there are handle hangers that look like large
hooks placed sidways with hinges at the top--a long straight tool
handle is inserted in the hook by lifting it away from the wall
and held in place by friction. </p>

<p>USE: Holding tools on a wall.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Draw an outline for each tool, or put a label above
each hanger, so you can always fit the tools back where they came
from. Make sure any supporting boards are securely anchored--a
half dozen garden tools can be very heavy and quite dangerous
should they fall. Hang pronged tools with sharp tips facing the
wall.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: These are useful because they help avoid a
dangerous clutter of tools on the floor, and keep the tools away
from moistsure as well. However, in many cases, large nails
driven part way into a thick board such as a 2 x 4, that is in
turn anchored securely to a wall can do just as well. Look for
systems that do not require two hands to use.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC1">GARDENING GLOVES </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Work gloves, protective gloves, garden gloves</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Constructed from cloth, canvas, leather, rubber,
or some form of pliable plastic, lined or unlined. Gloves
designed for pruning thorny brush or roses or picking fruit have
long gauntlet-type cuffs to protect the arms and are coated with
plastic-like material which thorns cannot penetrate. They may be
called <i>fruit picker gloves</i>. Lightweight, disposable
plastic gloves are also available. So-called <i>ladies' gloves </i>are
available in gingham, floral, and polka dot patterns as well as
plain, and tend to run in smaller sizes.</p>

<p>USE: Protect hands from blisters, dryness, cuts, and other
damage that might occur during gardening, and provide a better
grip in cold weather. <i>Neoprene gloves </i>are required for
handling toxic materials, and lightweight, disposable ones for
merely irritating chemicals. <u>Real</u> gardeners do NOT wear
gloves to keep their hands clean!</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Wear the appropriate glove for the job you are
doing. If you are transplanting delicate seedlings, don't wear
heavy gloves that dampen your sense of touch. Unlined cloth
gloves are good for light work and leather gloves that provide a
good grip are for heavier or dangerous work. Check the directions
for cleaning, because only some leather gloves can be washed.
Most leather gloves that are soiled and damp become stiff and
difficult to use when they dry, and should be treated with saddle
soap or Murphy's Oil (just rinse out cotton gloves in a rain
barrel or sink). Some pigskin resists this stiffness. Gloves with
holes in them will no longer prevent blisters, and should be
replaced. Models with lots of little rubber dots are excellent
for gripping muddy tools, and may wear longer.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Gardeners should have several pairs of gloves.
Check the gloves for a comfortable fit that is neither too tight
or too loose. Design varies greatly from brand to brand, and some
makes offer a range of sizes, including those designed for women
and men. The better designs take the natural curve of your grip
into account. Look for material that resists cuts, snags, and
punctures; goatskin is used in top-of-the-line products.
Sheepskin, with its natural lanolin, is a real comfort if you can
find it, and such gloves tend to not impede your dexterity (other
skins, like goatskin, may offer the same thing, depending on the
make). Look also for reinforced palms and seams. Work gloves are
not an expensive investment, but generally the better gloves cost
a little more (around $10 for good leather work gloves) and are
worth it. When you find a pair that fits just right, you may want
to buy a several pairs right then for eventual replacement.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC2">GARDENING APRON and TOTE </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Gardener's apron</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Heavy canvas or cloth with pockets for small hand
tools, plant labels, seed packets, note pad, pencils, and the
like, designed to be worn like a kitchen apron, or in the case of
the tote, like a holster on a belt.</p>

<p>USE: Keeping small and often-used gardening tools and
accessories handy when not in use. Particularly useful during
spring planting days. </p>

<p>USE TIP: Aprons can be used for storage of these small
necessities whether being worn or not. Hang in an
&quot;open&quot; position; this has the advantage of keeping the
apron loaded and ready whenever you actually put it on. You may
want to dedicate a belt to the holster, so you can put it on over
your gardening outfit, rather than having to take your own belt
off each time you want to use the tote.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Heavy duty canvas aprons with many pockets and
double seams are the best. Shorter aprons allow free movement,
especially if you need to kneel, so the length should not go
beyond the knees.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC3">GARDEN CLOGS </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Colorful clogs that look like wooden Dutch shoes,
but are made of a rubberlike plastic. They have cushioned insoles
that can be removed so that the clog can be cleaned with a hose.</p>

<p>USE: Gardening shoes that hold up to moisture and repeated
cleanings.</p>

<p>USE TIP: The clog will outlast the insole, which is
replaceable.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC4">GARDEN BOOTS </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: High-top rubber boots with sturdy soles
reinforced in the instep for digging (pushing a shovel by
stepping on it) and an ankle patch. Easily removable, waterproof
boots.</p>

<p>USE: Allow unworrisome accumulation of mud on feet, and keep
feet dry.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Typically black; most of the best models are
English. Be sure to look for reinforcement where you push the
shovel with your instep, and shallow lugs (deep lugs hang onto
mud).</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC5">BOOT SCRAPER </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPITON: Many varieties, most of which fall into two
categories: mat and brush type, or &quot;H&quot; bar type. The
former is like a metal doormat, with several rows of metal teeth
instead of fiber or rubber, and the latter is a simple, flat,
6&quot; long piece of metal suspended between two uprights not
more than a foot long. The uprights are driven into the ground
near your door, putting the bar at just above ground level.
Sometimes the mat kind has brushes fixed on either side, and the
metal teeth are replaced by a wire brush. Brushes are
replaceable. Certain models have waist-high handles for comfort,
helping those of us who have trouble balancing on one leg,
whether from lack of strength or mere exuberance.</p>

<p>USE: Forcibly removing mud from the bottoms and sides of
boots.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC6">Garden Hats &amp; Sun Visors </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Wide-brimmed, light, hat made of cloth, plastic,
straw, leather, and even paper and cardboard, in a wide variety
of styles. A Panama hat is woven out of light straw.</p>

<p>USE: Personal, extremely portable sun shade. Wide brims keep
gnats away.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: A hat or visor is essential protection against the
harmful ultraviolet rays of the sun. Wear one as much as
possible. And never underestimate the role of fashion in your
choice of hats: a snappy-looking gardener is a better gardener,
they say. Also you might scare away some pest birds with some of
the more adventurous or unsuccessful designs.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Should be flexible, and a good quality hat should
&quot;breathe&quot; so to keep you cool during hot days. There
are no substitutes for genuine palm in terms of strength. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC7">TRUG</a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Sussex Trug, garden basket</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Shallow basket made of wide wooden strips, with
short wooden feet and a large handle. Typically about 1' to just
under 2' in length; size may be measured in liquid capacity (i.e.
2 pint, 1.5 gallon, and 3 gallon).</p>

<p>USE: Handy way to bring small garden tools or your vegetable
and flower harvest along with you as you work in the garden.</p>

<p>USE TIPS:</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Top-quality models are often English, made from
chestnut and willow. Other common, good materials are northern
ash weavings and oak handles.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC8">POISON OAK AND IVY CLEANSER </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Bottled salve.</p>

<p>USE: Applied within 2 to 8 hours after exposure to these
menaces, it removes the poison oil from your skin, actually
preventing the dreaded rash. Relieves itching, slows spreading,
and helps heal if applied to a rash directly. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC9">GARDEN SPEAKER </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Electronic hi-fi speaker in a decorative,
weatherproof housing, often cylindrical and intended to be
partially buried. </p>

<p>USE: Providing music in your garden from a remote source,
usually your interior radio, tape deck, or record player.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: It is unclear which kind of music plants prefer.
Watch your volume. Be careful not to disturb the neighbors. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC10">BIRD HOUSES, FEEDERS, AND FOOD </a><br>
<a name="RTFToC11">ABOUT BIRD EQUIPMENT: </a></h2>

<p>Almost all garden centers have a section devoted to birds,
stocking bird houses, bird feeders, bird seed and other items
designed to attract birds to the garden. Most gardeners get a
particular thrill when birds find the garden pleasing enough to
inhabit it. Furthermore, the presence of birds (and their
singing) in a garden reminds gardeners that they are
participating in a natural world that is larger than the
dimensions of the garden itself. Though some birds become pests,
and products are sold to rid the garden of them (see Chapter 4),
most birds are quite beneficial to gardens, consuming mosquitos
and other insect pests. In even the smallest garden (on apartment
balconies, too) there is room for a bird feeder or a small bird
house. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC12">BIRD BATHS </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Shallow basin which holds water, of almost
infinite variety in design and detail. Some are classic and
simple bowl-like designs, others whimsical animal motifs
(including one that recently appeared in the form of a cat,
ironically). Most bird baths are set on a pedestal to keep them
out of the reach of cats. Bird baths can be made of stone, glazed
clay, terra cotta, cement, plastic, cast aluminum, brass, and
still other materials. </p>

<p>USE: Attracting birds to your garden. Water is essential to
attract birds, and a bird bath provides this water while at the
same time being an attractive garden accessory.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Place bird baths in somewhat open areas so that
birds can see any approaching cats while they are bathing. This
is particularly important for basins that do not sit on pedestals
or stands. Keep filled with fresh water and wash bath out if
algae begins to grow. In areas of the country where winters are
harsh, basins should be emptied of water during the winter. If
not stored inside, they should be wrapped in plastic. Freezing
water will expand and crack even a stone bird bath.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Cheap plastic bird baths are not a good buy.
Besides looking cheap (this should be considered a permanent
decorative item) they are light, and the water-filled basin makes
them top-heavy. There are almost unlimited alternatives. Shop for
one that will complement your garden and be a focal point.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC13">BIRD HOUSES </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Made of wood, plastic, or metal, bird houses are
constructed in certain sizes, shapes and even colors to attract
the specific type of bird they were built to accommodate. For
example, the very social Purple Martins prefer to live and nest
in groups and are attracted to multi-compartment houses that will
house 6 to 24 nesting couples, usually perched on top of a tall
pole (which has to be taken down, or the house lowered, each
winter for cleaning). The wren, on the other hand, prefers to
nest in a solitary small house that is protected by lush plant
growth. The sizes of the hole(s) in bird houses determines what
birds will live in it, too. For example, house wrens, pygmy and
brown-headed titmice use a house with a 1&quot; hole; chickadees,
Carolina wrens, tufted and plain titmice, and small woodpeckers
need a small hole 1-1/4&quot; in diameter; bluebirds, and
swallows want a hole that is 1-1/2&quot; in diameter. As for
materials, a popular type is a sawdust/clay/concrete mixture that
looks and feels like wood or dried mud, the normal stuff birds
make nests of. Also popular are those with genuine thatched
roofs. Of all the woods, cedar lasts longest. Many have openings
for cleaning out the houses every now and then.</p>

<p>USE: Attracting birds by providing a place for them to nest in
your garden. Since many birds nest in the same place year after
year, once you have housed nesting birds they should be with you
for many years. Attracting nesting birds that are known to eat
bugs is a great natural way of controlling many garden pests. </p>

<p>USE TIP: Bird houses should be placed in areas where cats
cannot reach them. If this is not possible, then you must find
ways to cat-proof the house, such as wrapping a wooden pole in a
sheet of galvanized tin about 3 feet tall to prevent cats from
climbing up. How high a bird house is placed and what direction
it faces are all important considerations for getting the tenant
you want to occupy it. This information can be easily found in
your library, in most popular field guides and books and articles
on attracting wildlife. You might also try checking your local
Cooperative Extension bulletins.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Look for sturdy bird houses. Know specifically
what birds you want to nest in your house, and buy one that is
stated to have been made for that particular bird. Shop around,
as prices do vary considerably. Martin houses, being bigger, are
generally more expensive than others, and should be well
ventilated (and white). Check your reference books to find out
what size hole you need for the birds you want to attract, and
measure the holes before buying--often they are not marked. As
for &quot;manufactured&quot; wood vs natural, it seems to be a
matter of personal preference. The birds are not choosy. What's
important is that the house endures, and the clay/concrete
mixture seems to be the sturdiest; furthermore, squirrels and
predator birds are unable to enlarge the hole.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC1">BIRD FEEDERS </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A tremendous array of designs exist, from
whimsical and rustic to extremely high-tech, but all bird feeders
consist of some type of chamber to hold bird seed and some place
for birds to perch while feeding. Bird feeders can be round
cylinders, rectangular boxes or covered top shelters in which the
seed is placed in a feeding tray. They are made of plastic, wood,
glass, metal and combinations of these materials. Some are even
designed to be mounted on a window. Most have some device for
preventing squirrels from feeding, or to exclude heavier
&quot;nuisance&quot; birds, such as blackbirds or pigeons.</p>

<p>USE: Bird feeders are most often used to attract birds to the
garden during off-seasons such as winter, when other food is
scarce. Some feeders, however, are designed to attract a
particular type of bird during seasons when they migrate through
your area. Other feeders are used to attract particular types of
birds in the spring in the hope that they will nest in or near
your garden. Always keep your feeder full during the season.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Squirrels are the enemies of bird feeders, as they
enter and devour all the seed if at all possible. Place bird
feeders in locations that make it difficult for squirrels (and
cats, of course) to get to them, such as on metal poles and away
from branches and climbable parts of buildings. Or add an
accesory called a <i>squirrel baffle</i>, a large plastic disk
which fits on the support pole or hangs above a wire-held feeder.
A <i>seed catcher</i>, a large saucer that attaches to the pole
under the feeder, catches any stray seeds that might fall.
(Sunflower seeds act as herbicide and kill your grass.)</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Other than buying a sturdy, well-made feeder,
particular consideration should be paid to whether the feeder is
squirrel- or cat-proof.</p>

<p>Look for models hung from wires or poles with circular
squirrel guards. Bird feeders that have wide platform areas give
squirrels a place to perch while raiding a feeder, and should be
avoided. Window-mounted models may work better with one-way
mirrors so you don't scare the birds away. The feeder should be
able to adequately dispense the size of bird seed you wish to put
in it. For example, finches, wrens and many small birds feed on
thistle seed and small grains. If the dispensing part of a feeder
is too large, these smaller seeds will not be held well.
Sunflower seed cannot be dispensed if the openings are too small.
Buy feeders that will attract the specific birds you want. This
information should be included in the packaging but can also be
found in reference books.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC2">BIRD SEED </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Grains and seeds, usually mixed, including
sunflower, safflower, peanut hearts, millet, sunflower chips,
thistle, and cracked corn. Mixtures of different types of grain
and seed are blended to match the diets of certain types of
birds. Some garden centers sell the seed unmixed so that you can
buy and mix your own, depending on the type of birds you have or
want to attract. </p>

<p>USE: Placed in bird feeders primarily to supplement birds'
diets during times when other food is scarce, such as winter.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Select the type of seed to attract the birds you want
most. Avoid unshelled sunflower seeds if you have a squirrel
problem, as this is their favorite. Mixes that contain unshelled
sunflower seed are for larger birds. The shells of sunflower
seeds contain a natural herbicide and kill vegetation if they
collect on the ground under a feeder, so you would not want them
to accumulate on lawns or flower beds. </p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Bird seed is not expensive, so experiment to find
those mixes that attract the birds you want. With a little
research, you can easily learn what types of seed certain birds
prefer.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC3">SUET BALLS AND CONES </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS:</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Suet balls are made of animal fats or lard
compressed into a small ball and imbedded with bird seed. The
ball has a string or a wire attached so that it can be hung from
a tree. Suet cones are large pine cones that have been dipped in
animal fats and sprinkled with bird seed.</p>

<p>USE: Supplement to birds' winter diet, when food is scarce.
The suet itself is supposed to be helpful to the birds during
cold weather.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Note that suet balls and cones are primarily for
winter feeding— they become a dripping mess in warm weather. A
metal collar is necessary to act as a squirrel guard.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Suet balls are an inexpensive and easy way to feed
birds in winter. As inexpensive as they are, some people find
them a nice home project to make themselves.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC4">HUMMINGBIRD FEEDER </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: There are several types of hummingbird feeders on
the market but all have several things in common. Each has a
reservoir for holding a liquid sugar mixture (often sold as <i>hummingbird
nectar</i>). All or part of the feeders are red, as this color
attracts hummingbirds. Feeding tubes that resemble the trumpet
shape flower that hummingbirds naturally take nectar from are
attached to the sides. Feeders may have a single or several
feeding tubes or fountains (small holes that the hummingbird
sticks its beak into). </p>

<p>USE: Attracting this fascinating bird to the garden.</p>

<p>USE TIP: If the liquid reservoir on your feeder is clear, a
little red food coloring can be added to the nectar to help
attract hummingbirds. Learning something about the hummingbirds
in your area will help you attract them to your garden. For
example, hummingbirds migrate through the northeastern United
States in late summer, so this is the best time for putting out
feeders. Remember that hummingbirds feed from flowers, so the
feeder should not be placed higher than where the birds will
naturally look for it. </p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Hummingbird feeders are not expensive. Most will
attract hummingbirds if they are in the area at all, but ones
designed to be bee-proof are better. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC5">BONSAI AND FLOWER ARRANGING TOOLS &amp;
EQUIPMENT </a><br>
<a name="RTFToC6">ABOUT BONSAI </a></h2>

<p>The enduring Japanese art of growing miniature trees, Bonsai,
is very popular in all parts of this country. The trees leaves,
branches, and roots are clipped regularly, forcing the plant to
mature without getting large. Specialized tools have been
developed which make this work easier.</p>

<p>Bonsai plants need gentle care. If you are not a serious
bonsai hobbiest and receive a plant as a gift, take a course at a
nearby botanic garden or search out some good books on the
subject, of which there are many.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC7">BONSAI SNIPS </a></h2>

<p>TYPES:</p>

<p><i>Scissors</i></p>

<p><i>Shears</i></p>

<p><i>Branch Nippers</i></p>

<p><i>Wire Cutters</i></p>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS:</p>

<p><i>Scissors: </i>Beginner's shears, Bud shears (with small
finger loops)</p>

<p><i>Shears: </i>Trimming shears</p>

<p><i>Branch Nippers: </i>Concave cutter</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Specially adapted snips for more control and
precision in the detail work required by Bonsai gardening.</p>

<p><i>Scissors: </i>Black wrought iron or carbon steel scissors
with short blades (about 1&quot;-- <i>Koryu</i> style) and long
handles, either with small finger holes on the end or with large
butterfly loops for the entire hand. Overall length about
6&quot;. </p>

<p><i>Shears: </i>Like scissors, but with slightly longer blades
(about 2&quot;) and butterfly handles--called <i>ashinaga</i>, or
more correctly, <i>naga ashi</i> <i>bonsai hasami</i> --<i>hasami</i>
means shears in Japanese.</p>

<p><i>Branch Nippers: </i>Black wrought iron pincers, with
beveled, wide, curved jaws about 1&quot; long and 3/4&quot; wide.
Resemble wide pliers. Long handles; tool is about 8&quot; long
overall.</p>

<p><i>Wire Cutters: </i>Resembles above-mentioned scissors, but
1&quot; short blades are thicker. Handles have finger loops at
end.</p>

<p>USE: Maintaining bonsai plants with precision. <i>Scissors</i>
are for leaf trimming; <i>Shears</i> for cutting small branches
and leaves; <i>Branch Nippers</i> are for making concave cuts
when removing branches; <i>Wire Cutters</i> cut wire close to
branch. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC8">BONSAI TROWELS </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Miniature versions of<b> trowels (Chapter 5)</b>
and scoops, usually made of one piece of metal.</p>

<p>USE: Careful moving of soil in <b>Bonsai planters (below)</b>.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC9">BONSAI PLANTER </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Shallow oval and rectangular dish, usually of
glazed ceramic material but also of plastic, with drainage holes.
Commonly sold with matching saucer.</p>

<p>USE: Growing bonsai plants.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC10">FLORAL FOAM </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Oasis (actually a popular brand name), foam
brick, floral base, floral foam brick</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Green stiff styrofoam block, sold in cubes about
6&quot; on a side, that can be cut to size, treated with a floral
preservative. May come with adhesive on one side. Dry floral foam
is similar, but intended for use with dried and silk flowers (and
plastic flowers, too, if you must). A similar product that is
less common is <i>floral clay,</i> which works in much the same
way as foam.</p>

<p>USE: Holding the stems of cut flowers in the bottom of a
floral arrangement. Stems are merely stuck into the foam at any
angle. Foam is first floated on the water until it is saturated,
then held down with waterproof adhesive <b>floral tape</b> <b>(below)
</b>made for this purpose.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Helps retain water and extend flower life.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC11">FLOWER HOLDERS </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Flower pins, needlepoint flower holder, kenzan
(Japanese), floral holder</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Small, heavy, flat or domed disk or rectangle
with many 1&quot; spikes, usually green enameled or brass. Round
ones are as small as 1&quot; in diameter, with 4&quot; a common
size. May have a lead-weighted base surrounded by rubber. Some
models on adjustable pedestals are made for putting short-stemmed
flowers in with longer ones. An older version with notched copper
hooks that look like hairpins instead of spikes is called a <i>flower
frog </i>or a <i>hairpin frog.. </i></p>

<p>USE: Holding the stems of cut flowers in the bottom of vases
for floral arrangements. Domed models are for splays of flowers.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Permanent and re-usable, as opposed to <b>floral
foam (above). </b>Brass spikes are the most desirable, though
galvanized steel does fine.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC12">CUT FLOWER PRESERVATIVE </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Cut flower food</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: A type of fertilizer and conditioner for cut
flowers in granular form.</p>

<p>USE: When mixed with water in a vase, can preserve cut flowers
an extra week or so by cutting down on bacterial growth, which
also keeps the water clear. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC13">FLOWER ARRANGING ACCESSORIES </a></h2>

<p>TYPES:</p>

<p><i>Floral Tape</i></p>

<p><i>Floral Wire</i></p>

floral tape conceals the wires, especially on corsages; short,
thin floral picks hold stems in foam; floral adhesive, usually in
1&quot; wide tape form, holds the foam in the bottom of the vase.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC14">CEMETERY CONE </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Small plastic cone, about the size of a jumbo
ice-cream cone, filled with a small bouquet of plastic flowers.</p>

<p>USE: Attaches permanently to gravestones.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Usually carried only by those garden centers
located near a cemetery.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC1">GNOMES, FLAMINGOS, AND WHIRLIGIGS </a><br>
<a name="RTFToC2">ABOUT GARDEN ORNAMENTS </a></h2>

<p>Garden centers that a few years ago limited their selections
of garden art to designer urns, fancy teak chairs, benches or a
few pieces of sculpture are now selling plastic dwarfs and pink
flamingos. </p>

<p>The use of lawn and garden decorations is highly subject to
fashion or fad, although it has long been more popular in the
South. Ironically, many of the major manufacturers are in the
North, including Quebec, which is quite seriously North. The
ornaments themselves have been sold since the late 1700's. When
these objects seem to be enjoying an &quot;in&quot; period,
gardeners who would not have dared to put such things in public
display a few years earlier unabashedly amass large collections
of gnomes and other creatures. Others who find the fad funny put
pink flamingos in their gardens to make a statement about the
current fashion, confounding the critics who are then unable to
discern between those who are proud of such objects and those who
are spoofing them. </p>

<p>These garden variety &quot;objets d'art&quot; give gardeners
an opportunity to display their taste in public, leading one to
ask, &quot;At what point does kitsch become art?&quot; This is a
difficult question to answer, especially for a buying guide such
as this. Excess and flamboyance may actually help develop our
collective sense of taste. However, instead of the usual garden
experts, its more likely that archeologists, art critics, art
historians, social commentators, and psychologists could provide
answers--perhaps not definitive ones, but certainly more profound
ones. Even some of the religious objects may be chosen for the
same unspoken reason many of the animal or fantasy symbols are:
some sort of basic, intimate desire for protection and a wish for
continued fertility of the garden. It could be the sort of thing
that taps into our collective unconscious and identification with
archetypal symbols: we've moved on from totems, rocks, and
petroglyphs, but not far--this is simply the modern version. As
for the whimsical objects, they seem to be a way to keep the
child within us alive, tying in with the theme of endless
rejuvenation that is so appropriate to a garden. Anyway, it's
probably something like that, but maybe not.</p>

<p>A final note: Once caught up in a collecting frenzy, some
gardeners have difficulty curbing the impulse. In answer to the
often-asked question, &quot;how much is enough?&quot; it appears
that the answer is, according to one distinguished Southern
gardener, &quot;When it looks like you are selling the
stuff!&quot;</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC3">GNOMES </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Dwarfs, dwarves, elfs, elves, trolls,
leprechauns</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Elfish statues of &quot;little people&quot; in
odd clothes and with old faces that range in size from less than
a foot to around twenty inches high, though one model is 39&quot;
high; made of cast cement, bonded marble, plastic, or painted
plaster. They may be the natural color of the material from which
they are made or they can be painted to look more or less
life-like, depending on your taste. Some are wired with lights.
Gnomes come with a variety of props such as garden tools, pails,
lanterns, golf clubs, watering cans, a large snail, a book,
flutes, an accordion, and in poses such as a drunk or making an
internationally recognized obcene gesture. Props and poses can
either reflect the owners interests, personality, or some
imagined and longed-for identity. Folklore has long linked these
&quot;little people&quot; with the earth, trees, and water.
European in origin, one of the better quality lines, Heissner
Gnomes, has been manufactured in Germany since 1872. This may be
the &quot;old world&quot; that people so often link with
&quot;charm.&quot;</p>

<p>USE: Adding charm to your garden, and good luck.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Gnomes tend to do well when partially hidden behind
foliage or low branches, appearing to peek from behind plants.
Remember that dwarfs and gnomes are social creatures and a single
one does not look natural--place them in natural groupings of
three or more.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Though nothing lasts longer than concrete, the
colors may fade. Only the very expensive makes are painted very
accurately. Materials are largely a matter of personal taste.
Gnomes should be bought to scale: small gardens should have
smaller gnomes than large gardens. If you want a lot of dwarfs,
your best deal is to get a set of the Disney characters, such as <b>Snow
White and the Seven Drawfs (below).</b></p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC4">RELIGIOUS FIGURES </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Saints and shrines</p>

<p>TYPES:</p>

<p><i>Jesus</i></p>

<p><i>Mary</i></p>

<p><i>St. Joseph </i></p>

<p><i>St. Anthony </i></p>

<p><i>St. Fiacre</i></p>

<p><i>St. Francis </i></p>

<p><i>St. Jude </i></p>

<p><i>St. Patrick </i></p>

<p><i>St. Theresa (or St. Theresa of Avila)</i></p>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS:</p>

<p><i>Mary:</i> Madonna, Blessed Mother, The Blessed Virgin, The
Virgin Mary</p>

<p><i>St. Anthony: St. Anthony the Abbot</i></p>

<p><i>St. Theresa:</i> The Little Flower, Little Flower of Jesus,
St. Therese, St. Therese of the Child Jesus (St. Theresa of Avila
is a different Saint)</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Any one of a number of Catholic saints or
important Biblical religious figures<i> </i>in traditional
religious poses, made of painted (often with several layers of
acryllic lacquer) or plain cast cement, stone, marble, plastic,
or lead, and ranging in height from 18&quot; to 54,&quot; most
commonly including the ones listed here.</p>

<p>Most saints are left unpainted, but are also available in full
color; <i>Jesus</i> and <i>Mary</i> are more often available
painted in multiple colors, and in <i>Bleeding</i> - or <i>Sacred
Heart </i>versions; both are shown in the forms of various
apparitions, such as &quot;Lady of Lourdes,&quot; or Jesus as the
&quot;Infant of Prague.&quot; Jesus, Mary and Joseph may often be
sold as a set, usually with Jesus shown as a child, in a
year-round version different from the <i>nativity scene</i>,
another common item. <i>St. Francis</i> is usually shown with a
few birds. <i>Grottos </i>--small parabolic shell
backdrop/shelters--are sold separately, and may have a provision
for electric lighting, though some gardeners still prefer to
userareclawfoot bathtubs as backdrops. Grottos are usually
painted royal blue on the inside and fade to white on the
outside; the inside top may be plain, with a gold star, scalloped
with a radiant gold star, scalloped with a gold sun, or with a
radiant golden cross. <i>Praying children</i> and <i>cherubim</i>
are also available, with similarly small grottos or the means to
be attached to them. Some religious figures appear on the market
in response to a momentary fad, such as a three-foot figure of
the Pope during a tour here. One such model had nozzles in the
finger tips from which water flowed.</p>

<p>USE: Adding inspiration to a garden, to demonstate an affinity
to whatever the religious personage stands for, or to fulfill a
vow, ranging from promises to build a shrine for deliverance from
disease to personal accomplishment<b>.</b> Some religious
articles are seasonal and help to celebrate a particular holiday
(i.e. a fully lighted, plastic nativity set complete with three
wise men and a baby Jesus, for Christmas). An ancient tradition.</p>

<p><i>Jesus: </i>All aspects of faith.</p>

<p><i>Mary: </i>Most popular figure, perhaps because of relation
of woman to earth, as far as gardening is concerned, or simply as
one of the most popular figures to pray to. Also most likely to
appear.</p>

<p><i>St. Joseph:</i> Patron saint of workers and families. Also,
sometimes buried in the front lawn of a house that is proving
difficult to sell in order to find a buyer. </p>

<p><i>St. Anthony: </i>Patron saint of lost
articles--particularly helpful for those gardeners who
continually lose their tools.</p>

<p><i>St. Fiacre: </i>The patron saint of gardeners, most
appropriately. Usually depicted with a spade and a small plant.</p>

<p><i>St. Francis: </i>Universal symbol for the love of animals
and wildlife. Protestant Christians as well as Catholics put a a
St. Francis statue in a conspicious place in their garden to show
their affinity with nature. Often accompanied by tiny animals.</p>

<p><i>St. Jude: </i>Associated with lost and impossible causes,
usually those more serious than a failed garden.</p>

<p><i>St. Patrick: </i>If you have a snake problem, this one is
for you (especially if you are Irish).</p>

<p><i>St. Theresa: </i>&quot;Little Flower&quot; is often shown
with a small bouquet of flowers, or surrounded by roses (in
relation to her experience of a miraculous shower of roses).
Symbolic of a simple life. <i>St. Theresa of Avila </i>was a
Spanish mystic with a good sense of humor who is associated with
with common sense. (It is not always clearly indicated to the
consumer nor by the manufacturer which St. Theresa is being
sold.)</p>

<p>USE TIP: Do not mix the sacred and the profane. Disney
characters do not look natural beside a nativity creche. If you
bury a statue of St. Joseph, be sure to note where it is buried
so that you can retrieve it after the house is sold. </p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Judging from the number of new statues of saints
that are showing up on lawns, the vow arrangement must be
working. There are so many statues and shrines on the market
today that you should be able to pick and choose the one that is
suited for you at a price you can afford. <i>Mary</i> outsells
all the saints 10:1 at some garden centers (indeed, some stock
only Mary). Choice of saint is largely dictated by ethnic
background and geographic location. Because of the lack of
difference between the two St. Theresas, accepting the one you
bought as the one you want requires an act of faith. Some people
relate the price of the shrine to the difficulty of the task
involved in the vow it fulfills: deliverance from death would
seem to deserve, for example, more than a plastic <i>Mary</i>
(with or without an implanted light bulb).</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC5">FLAMINGOS</a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Invariably pink, large plastic or cement birds
that usually stand a yard tall and are sold in pairs. The body is
often cast or molded while the legs are extremely thin metal,
plastic or wood stakes made to be stuck into the ground. Some
models are made with only one leg to imitate a natural resting
position, while others have two, to imitate a natural feeding
position. <i>Herons</i> are a similar-looking but all white bird
available in some garden centers.</p>

<p>USE: Adds a touch of drama to a yard. The further away from
the natural range of the sub-tropical flamingoes you live, the
more drama they add to your garden. Tropical colors give a sense
of Miami Beach.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Flamingoes should be taken in during the winter, as
they appear particularly out-of-place in the snow. Furthermore,
flamingoes allowed to weather outside during the winter may lose
their pink color, leaving the bird looking drab, which then quite
defeats their purpose, as <i>drab</i> is not <i>dramatic</i>. <i>Herons</i>
should be placed near a body of water to appear more
natural-looking, as they do not add as much drama as flamingoes.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: It is a matter of personal taste as to whether the
one-leg or two-leg model is preferable, but some gardeners find
that the one-leg models make them nervous.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC6">BARNYARD ANIMALS </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Cast either in plastic or cement in the shapes of
familiar farm animals such as roosters, hens, chicks, ducks,
ducklings, lambs, and sheep. Also available as wooden cutouts,
painted, or covered with polyester immitation wool (in the case
of sheep), or a sort of furry material that expands when wet to
resemble the three-dimensional real thing. Sheep come in two
styles: with heads down at grass level (&quot;grazing&quot;
position) or up (&quot;looking&quot; position), and in small (1
foot), medium, and large (2 1/2 feet) sizes. Some large sheep may
also have a bell at their necks.</p>

<p>USE: To create a bucolic or &quot;cute&quot; effect. </p>

<p>USE TIP: Move your animals around the garden or lawn every day
to create the illusion that they are alive. Excellent gift item,
especially the fur-covered ones of the cuddly type. </p>

<p>BUYING TIP: If you are buying a family of chickens, be sure to
get the hen with the chicks, and not the rooster, even though he
may be more colorful, in order to biologically correct. Those
animals which are currled up and looking out at the viewer are
much more cuddly appearing that those which are in the standing
position. Sheep with their heads in the &quot;up&quot; position
generally cost $2 more, for no apparent reason. Large
polyester-on-plywood pigs and sheep can cost as much as $70.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC7">WILD AND DOMESTIC ANIMALS </a></h2>

<p>DESCRITION: A wide variety of animals, including skunks (with
or without a flower in paw), bunnies (with or without carrots),
frogs, raccoons, cats, dogs, kittens, little lambs (with Mary),
alligators, armadillos (also in bootscraper version) turtles,
pelicans, deer, lions, giant flapping butterflies, birds, bees,
ladybugs, donkeys, dogs, pheasants, and a few imagined creatures.
Frogs are available with lipstick and bowties, depending on the
sex, and playing various musical instruments. Butterflies and
some birds may come with a clothespin-type clip or other clamp
for attaching to branches or parts of your house. <i>Flocked</i>
models have life-like, weatherproof fur. All are available in a
range of materials, including plastic, aluminum, 1/2&quot; thick
wooden cutouts with spikes for placing in the ground, or
full-sized cast cement sculpture painted an unrealistic bronze
color. Rabbits, ducks, and chipmunks are commonly available in
sets as well. Certain manufacturers offer a number of wooden
cutout animals with signs attached, such as &quot;Skunk
Crossing&quot; or &quot;Snail Trail.&quot; Others make cast brass
signs with the animal and appropriate &quot;____ CROSSING&quot;
underneath, including quail (both single and family group),
flamingo, duck, bunny, frog, hummingbird, kitty, boy, and girl
figures. Many dog and cat models are recognizable by breed.</p>

<p>USE: Often collected by people who are into collecting one
type of animal -- for example, there are people who collect only
skunks or turtles or owls. But these animals could also be mixed
and matched.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Plastic and cement (painted and unpainted) in the
same garden looks particularly unatural. Stick with the same
material, such as all unpainted cement. Some people like to treat
their fur-covered animals with Scotchguard. </p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Animals with exceptionally expressive eyes tend to
cost more.</p>

<hr size="4">

<h2><a name="RTFToC0">JUST PLAIN BIZARRE ANIMALS AND FIGURES </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Large marine creatures (such as fish, clams, or
seahorses) in chomping action, little dogs with their back legs
raised (to be posed in an appropriate place, like near the wheel
of a car when it is parked in the driveway), other dogs (usually
basset hounds) with &quot;Welcome&quot; or &quot;Beware of
Dog&quot; painted on their ears, gutter snipes (urchins) in a
variety of poses<b>, </b>little sports players in action, seamen,
drunkards, and servants. A new appearance has been made by
dinosaurs, appropriately labeled &quot;Tyrannosaurus,&quot;
&quot;Stegosaurus,&quot; and the like.</p>

<p>USE: To have something unusual on your lawn that your neighbor
doesn't have yet, or to get otherwise taciturn visitors to ask
you questions about your garden. Considered by some gardeners as
necessary for providing a &quot;finishing touch&quot; to their
landscaping. There is no logical explanation for the popularity
of the little sports players as garden ornaments.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Manufacturers are coming up with new items all the
time, and though the first time you see one of these it will seem
extremely strange, as more and more people buy this new, strange
item it will become a familiar sight in our suburban landscape. </p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Expect a short life for your new and strange item
because its uniqueness is bound to wear thin or completely off
after a while. Frequent visits to garden centers will insure that
you will be one of the first people on your block to have the
newest and the weirdest. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC1">FAT FANNY </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Gardening girl</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Wooden cutout of a rear view of a woman in a
polka-dot dress bent over so that all you see is the polka-dot
clad rump and two short legs, although now there is a thinner,
bikini-clad version. Male version also available, sometimes
called <i>Fat Freddy. </i>Sizes range from 16&quot; to 24&quot;
high.</p>

<p>USE: To show the general public that you have a sense of
humor.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Most effective when seen from a distance at high
speed--excellent for those people who live near a major highway.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Look for well-painted wood that will stand up to
the weather.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC2">MUSHROOMS AND TOADSTOOLS </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Cast cement sculpture in a variety of sizes from
6 inches to as much as a yard high, available in single, double,
and triple versions. May be painted in a variety of bright or
even garish colors, including polka dots, or may be left
unpainted, such as is often the case with cast cement.
&quot;Toadstool&quot; refers to relatively flat-topped mushrooms.</p>

<p>USE: Making a complementary setting for gnomes, deer, and
other decorative lawn and garden creatures.</p>

<p>USE TIP: If the top and the stem of the toadstool are two
separate pieces, be sure that they fit together well and the fit
is also snug (tight). This could be a safety concern in the
matter of larger, heavier models, not only for the nearby gnomes
but also for children or other visitors to your garden who might
bump it.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: If your other statuary is unpainted, choose
toadstools that are also unpainted. Otherwise, the effect is an
inconsistancy similar to that of being lost between Kansas and
the Land of Oz. </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC3">WISHING WELL </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Plastic, plaster, cement, or wooden stucture that
resembles an old covered wellhouse above a well shaft. These
replicas are often complete with bucket, chain or rope, and
crank. </p>

<p>USE: To add a certain rustic charm to your garden, a charm
that is particularly lacking in the suburbs. </p>

<p>USE TIP: People can't resist the urge to toss money into a
wishing well, so locate yours nearly a heavily travelled
thoroughfare and collect what you can.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Go for the larger sizes. Small ones especially
tend to look more ridiculous than larger ones, almost like a
child's beach toy, and should be avoided.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC4">SUNDIAL</a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Round, flat, cast bronze or stone clockface,
almost always with Roman numerals. Designed to be mounted on a
pedestal or rock, or as a wall placque. A pointer, called a <i>gnomon</i>,
is attached in the center and angles up over the XII. (The
&quot;4&quot; on clockfaces is written &quot;IIII&quot; instead
of &quot;IV&quot;, for some reason). A few are manufactured with
arabic numerals for those who resist the traditional (this kind
of clock has been around for 22 centuries--that's a lot of
tradition). Usually inscribed with phrases such as &quot;Time
takes all but memories&quot; or &quot;Tempus fugit&quot; and/or
decorated with American eagles, frogs, turtles, small boys
fishing, or sailboats, any of which may double as gnommens.
Another version is the <i>sun clock</i>, which has a half-circle
band with arabic numerals cut out, held at an angle over a flat
piece (usually a star) and with a line down its middle. The
reverse shadow of the appropriate numeral falls on the line to
tell the time. Still another model is the <i>equatorial</i> <i>sundial</i>,
in which the numerals are on a curved, angled band with a line,
usually an arrow, at its axis; a full-sphere model is called an <i>armillary</i>
sundial.</p>

<p>USE: Tells time on sunny days by the fall of the shadow from
the gnomon. </p>

<p>USE TIPS: Follow installation directions carefully for
accurate readings. Mount on a large rock or pedestal, and <u>make
sure it is perfectly level</u>. Align the gnomon with the North
Star (not magnetic north). The word <i>gnomon</i> is especially
useful for those gardeners who play Scrabble.</p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Get good bronze (about 88% copper). </p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC5">SPECIAL PLANTERS </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Plastic or cast cement planters in the shape of
wheelbarrows, swans, geese, turtles, hippos, bears, frogs, lambs,
burros (with or without sombrero-clad napping figure) or other
creatures. Some burros, also known as mules, are accompanied by a
walking figure, commonly referred to as &quot;Pedro.&quot; These
are similar to the same objects sold as lawn ornaments, but they
contain an additional receptacle for holding plants.</p>

<p>USE: As a decorative or attention-getting planter for
terraces, roof gardens or for the lawn, especially in areas where
there is little soil.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Once you have determined where the planter is most
effective from a design point of view, select plants which can
grow well in the light of that particular place. For example, put
impatiens or caladiums in a shady or partially shady spot.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Unless they are being used for aquatic gardening,
be sure that there are drainage holes in the bottom. If it is
impossible to add holes, place plenty of gravel and charcoal in
the bottom before adding soil.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC6">WHIRLIGIGS</a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Wooden or plastic decorations with propellers
that are either linked to wires which move a figure or else
simply placed alongside in the shape or place of wings. Designs
of the former include women washing clothes, churning butter, or
watering plants; men chopping wood, pumping water, starting a
car, or being kicked in the derriere by a donkey; also excitable
scarecrows, and feeding chickens. Designs of the latter type
include ducks, geese, flamingos, airplanes, Dutch windmills,
American farm-type windmills, California raisins, Maine potatoes,
cartoon characters (with the blades as feet, not wings), and
political figures. Usually painted bright colors. Mounted on long
stakes that are stuck in the ground. </p>

<p>USE: Adds eye-catching action to a garden. A combination wind
vane and novelty item. Often sold as folk art in the Smokey
Mountains and parts of Appalachia. May also scare birds away and
keep you from napping in the garden, depending on the amount of
noise they make. Originally used to repel moles: the vibrations
set up by a moving whirligig scare them away.</p>

<p>USE TIP: When these are mounted on a pole be sure that they
are level and that the moving parts are well oiled. With the
models of a person working, the greatest pleasure is commonly
found in watching them work at top speed in the winds that occur
just before a summer thunderstorm.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: If you wish to have one of these moving weather
vanes as a &quot;folk art&quot; item, buy only those that are
hand crafted in wood. They will cost a little more than the less
authentic, mass-produced plastic or wooden ones. Some people find
the depiction of chores linked to the tradtional gender a sexist
problem.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC7">SPINNING DAISIES </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Brightly colored plastic flowers about 12&quot;
in diamter with thick wire &quot;stems&quot; for staking in the
ground. The petals spin on their own stems, like pinwheels, when
the wind blows through them. Some are available without
propellers but with reflectors for lining driveways.</p>

<p>USE: As a pure lawn decoration and also used to mark the
entrance to your driveway for gardeners who entertain many
out-of-town friends.</p>

<p>USE TIP: For the best motion, turn daisies to face the
direction that the wind blows from most frequently.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Considered a safe fallback to add color to your
garden if you do not have a green thumb.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC8">ORIENTAL OBJECTS </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Japanese lanterns, fat Buddhas, meditating
Buddhas, dragons, Japanese scholars, miniature pagodas, temple
guard dogs, Samurai warriers, Tiki gods, Tiki torches, and arched
footbridges. Made of cast cement or bonded marble, natural cement
color or artificially bronzed. Derived from traditional Japanese
garden decor.</p>

<p>USE: To add a touch of the exotic to your landscape.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Do not mix Samurai warriers with Buddhas.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Although &quot;Tiki&quot; generally implies a
South Pacific style, some of the designs resemble Easter Island
god-sculptures.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC9">GAZING GLOBES </a></h2>

<p>ALSO KNOWN AS: Reflective balls</p>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Mirror-like hand-blown glass ball, usually placed
upon a pedestal.</p>

<p>USE: To attract attention.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Do not place near active play area, as globes are
made of glass.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC10">GOOSE AND DUCK WIND SOCKS </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Large fabric socks printed to look like ducks or
geese, attached to stakes that are stuck into the lawn. When the
wind fills the fabric body of the birds they undulate and appear
to be moving like the real thing; they hang limply when there is
no wind. These work on the same principle as fabric carps that
are used in Japan to celebrate the birth of a boy child.</p>

<p>USE: Adds movement to ornamentation in order to draw attention
to your yard. Also tells you if the wind is blowing or not, and
from which direction.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Use in groups of half a dozen or more, just as geese
tend to land and feed in flocks.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP:</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC11">JOCKEY AND SERVANT HITCHING POSTS </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Cast iron, plaster, plastic, or cement statue of
a 3 to 4 foot tall jockey or servant in formal (red topcoat and
tophat) or riding attire. His right arm is raised and often
contains a ring for tethering your horse or mule, or a small
lamp. Until recently the jockey was black, but generally they are
now white, reflecting a positive, though very minor, step in
evolution of our society's race consciousness. Other hitching
post lawn ornaments include the head of a horse with a ring in
its nose, or a simple pole with a ring attached to the top.</p>

<p>USE: Originally to provide the mystique of the &quot;ole
South,&quot; now is nothing more than pure ornamentation, used
primarily at the end of a walk.</p>

<p>USE TIP: Existing black jockeys may easily be painted white.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Not considered trendy.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC12">CARTOON CHARACTERS </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Disney characters and other familiar cartoon
friends. Recent introductions to lawn and garden decor, they are
almost always made of colorful plastic. Snow White and the Seven
Dwarfs is sold as a unit of approximately 8 pieces.</p>

<p>USE: Personal experession in public. These objects reflect
your interest and personality more than most of the other
ornaments. </p>

<p>USE TIP: Bambi may not go with more serious garden or
landscape concepts. </p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Cartoon characters are among the most affordable
of the lawn objects on the market. If you are on a limited budget
but wish to collect, this would be a good place to start.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC13">TORCHES AND CANDLES </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Wicks surrounded by citronella-scented wax,
either in glass jars (<i>low boy candles</i>), small galvanized
buckets, or on 3' long wooden stakes. <i>Tonga torches</i> hold a
quart of petroleum fuel (can be citronella-scented) and come in
either bronze or black metallic finishes.</p>

<p>USE: Dramatic source of light which also repels mosquitoes.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: Large wax torches drip on the ground, so do not
place them near a patio which must remain pristine. Do not use
torches indoors.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC14">CLASSIC SCULPTURE AND FOUNTAINS </a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Figures and shapes of a variety so diverse as to
be impossible to list here, though derived essentially from
Western European stock classic art styles, ranging in periods
from the Greek to the colonial to the abstract. The most popular
include small, svelte figures of nymphs and cherubs as well as a
series of scallop shells plumbed internally for cascading water.
Pumps may or may not be included; some models are wired for
internal lighting.</p>

<p>USE: Adds a touch of class to a garden.</p>

<p>USE TIPS: The higher the waterfall, the louder the noise. Do
not place near popular nap locations. </p>

<p>BUYING TIPS: Some regional preferences may be reflected in the
stock your garden center carries, such as a fountain in the shape
of an oil well for the oil-producing areas of our country.</p>

<h2><a name="RTFToC15">NUDES</a></h2>

<p>DESCRIPTION: Statues in plastic, cement and stone without
clothing, fig leaves, or loin cloths. Many items also sold in
covered versions--even Michelangelo's <i>David</i> is available
with or without a fig leaf. Many consumers today are turning over
a new leaf on what is acceptable in garden statuary, and are
boldly displaying copies of classic nude scultures, wood nymphs,
Pans, and gods and goddesses. Only the <b>Virgin Mother </b>and<b>
Snow White (above)</b> seem to have escaped this revealing trend.
May be sold as <b>fountains (above).</b></p>

<p>USE: To demonstrate your taste and standards of expression on
a level wholly different from the other lawn ornaments noted
above.</p>

<p>USE TIP: If you are shy about venturing into the exciting
world of nude statues, you may wish to start out by positioning
one modestly behind a small bush.</p>

<p>BUYING TIP: Expect to pay more for nudes: art comes at a
price.</p>

        Powerful<br>
        Search Capabilities to Select the Perfect Plants for Your
        Garden</i></h4>
        <p align="left">PALO ALTO, Calif., May 1, 1995 -- Books
        That Work, a leading multimedia software publisher of
        home and garden titles, announced today the release of
        Garden Encyclopedia. Garden Encyclopedia features a
        highly intuitive interface and powerful search
        capabilities that make it easy for anyone to select the
        right plants for their garden. Garden Encyclopedia
        contains more than 1000 annuals, perennials, bulbs,
        vegetables, shrubs, and groundcovers. Color photographs
        and important attributes such as growing zone, bloom
        season, and sun requirements make Garden Encyclopedia a
        virtual at-home nursery. Garden Encyclopedia is available
        on CD-ROM for WindowsTM at retail computer software

        <p>Garden Encyclopedia's interface provides a logical
        method for browsing plants or rapidly executing searches
        based on flower color, bloom season and sun requirements.
        Because the common names for plants can refer to multiple
        plants, the program contains audio clips of the correct
        pronunciation of botanical plant names. This allows you
        to select the right plant when visiting the nursery. The
        program also lets you to create, save, and print
        customized plant lists. Pest and disease control
        information is included to help maximize growing success.
        </p>
        <p>Garden Encyclopedia also offers instruction on care,
        planting and propagation techniques using how-to video
        segments complete with narration. In addition to the
        video clips and text, there are more than two dozen lists
        of plants that share an interesting characteristic such
        as &quot;plants that attract hummingbirds&quot; or
        &quot;plants that thrive in heat&quot;. </p>
        <p>Garden Encyclopedia is a fast, practical reference
        tool that saves you time and money by providing expert
        information and tools to select plants that will thrive
        in your garden. </p>
        <p><b>System Requirements</b></p>

        PC or 100% compatible, 4MB RAM minimum; VGA monitor with

            <p>A New Way to Bring Home Furnishing Manufacturers'
            Product Information to Consumers via the World Wide
            Web </p>
            <p><b>PALO ALTO, Calif., October 7, 1996</b> - Books
            That Work, the leader in home and garden consumer
            software, introduces Digital Collections, a new
            technology for consumers to &quot;try before they
            buy&quot; and a powerful way for home furnishing
            manufacturers to advertise their products. Using
            Books That Work's latest 3D design software product,
            Visual Home you can create home designs with
            expandable collections of real eappliances,
            furniture, cabinets and fixtures. For the first time,
            home design software users can use the Internet to
            access Collections of new furniture, textures, and
            even sample floorplans. With Digital Collections,
            customers actually include real products into their
            virtual remodeling designs. As a result, the Digital
            Collections Program gives advertisers direct access
            to these highly self-selecting customers. Home
            furnishing manufacturers can put product information
            where it counts&#151;on the consumers own drawing
            board. Visual Home is available on CD-ROM for Windows
            at retail computer and software stores nationwide for
            around $60.00. </p>
            <p>&quot;The Digital Collections Program offers
            unique benefits to both consumers and advertisers.
            With a steady supply of new data easily available on
            the Internet, customers get powerful remodeling and
            redecorating software that is never out of
            date,&quot; said Dan Levin, President of Books That
            Work. &quot;Manufacturers get the chance to put
            product information in the hands of active remodelers
            just as they are designing their projects - an
            extremely focused and powerful advertising
            vehicle.&quot; </p>
            <p><b>Ease of Use</b><br>
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Distributed on a CD-ROM or over the Internet,
                Digital Collections are easy to install, and
                become fully integrated with the Visual Home user
                interface. A group of manufacturer's Collections
                are delivered pre-installed on the CD. More are
                available for quick, free download from the
                Visual Home Web site (<a
                href="http://visualhome.com">www.visualhome.com</a>).
                </p>
                <p>Digital Collections transcend conventional
                advertising because manufacturers can deliver
                their products in the same form that Books That
                Work delivers its generic examples. Users select
                all components from visual menus and can freely
                substitute generics with branded items. This
                means that consumers can try multiple brands and
                confirm that each item fits their space--and
                their budget. </p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>Manufacturers strive to reach potential
                customers before they head to retailers to make
                purchases. For the first time, manufacturers can
                put comprehensive product information, including
                available sizes, materials, colors, options and
                much more in the hands of a highly targeted group
                of customers. And customers get their first
                chance to design real products into their homes,
                kitchens or baths - in real, available, sizes and
                colors. The product specs also include a URL that
                links the customer directly to the advertiser's
                site on the World Wide Web. </p>

        <h3 align="center">Books That Work Releases 2.0 Version
        of 3D Landscape:<br>
        America's #1 Selling Landscape Design Software </h3>
        <h4 align="center"><em>Design Your Dream Landscape<br>
        and Experience It In Vivid 3D </em></h4>
        <p>PALO ALTO, Calif., March 5, 1996 -- Books That Work,
        the leading multimedia publisher of home and garden
        software, today released <i>3D Landscape 2.0</i>, the new
        version of America's #1 selling landscape design
        software. 3D Landscape 2.0 is packed with improved
        graphics, new 3D visualization capabilities, and hundreds
        of additional plants. </p>
        <p>The new 2.0 version includes: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Enhanced 3D graphics for near photo-realistic
                views of landscape designs </li>
            <li>The ability to &quot;walk&quot; through a design
                to see it from multiple perspectives </li>
            <li>Seasonal Change to see how plants will change
                their appearance throughout the year </li>
            <li>Twice the number of plants to make the right
                choice for your design </li>
            <li>3D models of popular landscape accents, including
                gazebos, fountains, and pets </li>
        </ul>
        <p>3D Landscape 2.0 is available on CD-ROM for Windows
        3.1 and Windows 95 at retail computer and software stores
        nationwide for around $60.00. </p>
        <p><b>Visualize Your Landscape Now and in the Future</b> </p>
        <p>At anytime while you are creating a design you can see
        it in 3D with the click of a button. 3D Landscape 2.0's
        new 3D graphics engine creates incredibly vivid
        full-color three-dimensional scenes to help you evaluate
        your design. Take a virtual walk through your design to
        get a different perspective, judge proportions, and
        ensure you're pleased with the final results. The new
        Seasonal Change feature shows you how your trees and
        plants will look during different times of the year. Our
        widely-praised Growth Over Time feature demonstrates how
        the yard will look as it matures over the years so that
        you can properly plan the spacing of trees and shrubs.
        The Shadow Casting feature shows how shadows fall on your
        landscape anytime of the day or year - an important
        consideration when trying to decide where to locate a
        flower bed or a patio. </p>
        <p><b>Find the Right Plants and Accents For Your Garden </b></p>
        <p>3D Landscape 2.0 comes with an extensive database of
        more than 800 plants including trees, shrubs, and
        flowers. That means you can select the correct plants for
        your climate and setting. The expandable plant database
        lets you include your own plants in your lists. 3D
        Landscape 2.0's design engine also comes with dozens of
        landscape accent items, including everything from bird
        baths to gazebos. </p>
        <p><b>Easy from Start to Finish</b> </p>
        <p>With 3D Landscape's new Quick Start feature, you get
        sample layouts to stimulate your imagination and get you
        started quickly. As you choose the trees and plants to
        enhance your property, 3D Landscape's Shopping List
        automatically calculates the cost of your design. Print
        your 2D and 3D designs at any time to give to a
        contractor or take it with you to the nursery. </p>
        <p><b>Professional Advice At Your Fingertips</b> </p>
        <p>3D Landscape 2.0's multimedia guide book provides
        detailed explanations of landscape design principles and
        building techniques. The guide uses animations,
        photography, and audio effects to provide you with
        important information to consider when selecting plants,
        working with contractors, or trying to do-it-yourself. </p>
        <p><b>System Requirements</b> </p>
        <p>3D Landscape 2.0 requires a 486 or higher IBM PC or
        compatible, WindowsÆ 3.1 or WindowsÆ 95, 8 MB RAM, 10
        MB hard disk space, VGA graphics (256 colors), and CD-ROM
        drive (double speed or higher recommended). </p>

	<font size="5"><b>L</b></font>ooming on the horizon are a number of "economic time bombs," which, if not defused now, threaten the prospects of a secure retirement for many Americans.  The imminent retirement of the "Baby Boom" generation soon after the turn of the century will strain our nation's fiscal capacity and could imperil the standard of living for future generations.  Quite simply, we as a nation and as individuals are ill-prepared to meet the financial challenges of the twenty-first century.  We are confronted with a rapidly aging population, an actuarially unsound Social Security system, unsustainable levels of spending for government programs for senior citizens, under-funded private pension plans, and unacceptably low levels of private savings.  We have promised too much and set aside too little.  As a result, the "three-legged stool" ó Social Security, personal savings, and public and private pension plans ó that has traditionally financed Americans' retirement is increasingly unstable and threatens to collapse.<p>

	The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) proposes to launch a major policy initiative that will address the retirement financing challenge facing the United States early in the next century.  A critical aspect of this initiative will be the establishment of a bipartisan National Commission on Retirement Policy comprised of leaders from the public and private sectors.  The mission of the eighteen-month project will be to highlight the urgency of this potential crisis and recommend comprehensive and politically viable solutions to address it.  Public education will be necessary to help galvanize a political consensus for implementation of the necessary policy reforms.  In the project's first phase, CSIS will bring together key members of Congress and business leaders in a series of public forums in Washington and around the country to highlight the magnitude of the problem and educate the American public about the tradeoffs involved in addressing these problems.  In the second phase, CSIS will convene a series of  roundtable discussions and hearings to examine in-depth potential policy responses to the retirement financing crisis.  The project will culminate in the publication of a major policy report that will provide a blueprint for action.<p>

<i>"We owe it to those who will retire after the turn of the century to be given sufficient advance notice to make what alterations in retirement planning may be required.  The longer we wait to make what are surely inevitable adjustments, the more difficult they will become."</i><br>

<b><a name="signif">Project Significance</a></b><p>

	For the past half century, a secure retirement has been part of the American dream.  Now, however, as the result of immutable demographic changes, unsustainable fiscal trends, and imprudent governmental policy and individual choices, this dream may elude many Americans -- or become an untenable tax burden on the next generation.  Simply put, America is growing older.  The aging of America has profound implications -- both economic and social -- for the nation as a whole and for the individual and household financing of retirement.<p>

 	America is growing older.  Today, one in eight Americans is age 65 and older.  However, as the Baby Boom generation begins to retire in 2010, the percentage of older Americans will increase significantly.  By 2040, one in four will be in that age group.  At the same time, life expectancy continues to rise.  These demographic changes will place tremendous fiscal pressure on federal entitlement programs for the elderly.  Furthermore, due to a declining birthrate, there will be a comparably smaller workforce to help bear those costs in the future.<p>

 	We have promised too much.  Entitlement programs consume an ever increasing share of our national resources.  Mandatory spending on entitlements (principally Social Security and Medicare) has more than doubled since 1963, and now accounts for almost half of federal outlays.  By the government's own figures,at the current rate of federal spending, entitlements are projected to exceed all government revenues by 2030.<p>

 	We are saving too little.  As a nation and as individuals, we are not saving enough to meet future consumption needs.  The rate of personal savings has declined significantly since the 1960s to historically low levels -- from 11.3% in 1965 to 2.7% in 1993 -- which is insufficient to meet the future retirement needs of most Americans.<p>

	These trends are unsustainable.  Without significant public policy and social responses to the impending challenges, the standard of living for retirees after the first quarter of the 21st century could decline.  Society simply cannot afford all the retirement promises we have made.  A failure to act boldly with structural reforms now will dramatically raise the costs and the sacrifices necessary ten to twenty years down the road.  It is imperative that the fiscally unstable three-legged stool be significantly revised and strengthened:<p>

<ul>
<li><i>The Social Safety Net.</i>  Presently, inflows to the Social Security system exceed benefits paid out.  However, the program's trust fund will begin paying out more in benefits than it collects in payroll taxes by 2013.  Most analysts agree that if no action is taken now, the fund will be entirely depleted by 2029.  Most young Americans don't believe that Social Security will be there for them.  Medicare is in even worse shape, anticipated to be insolvent by 2001.  In fact, over the long term, the combined unfunded liabilities of  Medicare and Social Security will be nearly $1.8 trillion by 2030 and over $20 trillion by 2070. <p>

<li><i>Private Pensions.</i>  Currently, less than half of all workers are covered by a pension plan.  During the 1980s, companies discontinued 40,000 pension plans, and more firms are likely to follow suit as the Baby Boom generation nears retirement.  According to the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, total under funding of corporate pension plans stands at $64 billion -- twice the level from 1995.  Furthermore, over the last decade employers have shifted away from defined benefit to defined contribution plans, which has shifted risk to individuals and forced them to take more responsibility for investment decisions. <p>

<li><i>Personal Savings.</i>  Shortfalls in meeting retirement expenses will have to be supplemented with personal savings.  Current levels of retirement saving, however, are not nearly large enough to compensate for the projected drops in benefits from Social Security and pension plans.  Personal savings has fallen, from almost 12 percent of GDP in 1965 to about five percent in 1995.  According to a recent study by Merrill Lynch, the oldest Baby Boomers are saving just one-third of what they will need to maintain their current standard of living during retirement.</ul><p>


<b><a name="object">Statement of Objectives</a></b><p>

	The goals and objectives of the project and the National Commission on Retirement Policy are as clear as the CSIS mission statement:  policy impact.  It is our intention to see the work of this project influence the development of policy choices necessary to protect the American retirement dream.  The product of the Commission's efforts will be a legislative blueprint for a national retirement policy that will enable the United States to meet the fiscal challenges of the 21st century.<p>

	Before this can happen, however, there must be a great deal of public education and informed policy debate.  After raising crucial public awareness, the ultimate objective of the project will be formulating the policy options and recommendations for Congress, the Administration and the public.  With the strong bipartisan leadership and wealth of expertise of the Commission, CSIS is confident the project will yield tangible results and policy impact.<p>

<b><a name="description">Project Description & Methodology</a></b><p>

	The project will provide leadership and expertise in studying the challenges to retirement financing.  This will be accomplished through the establishment and work of the National Commission on Retirement Policy.  The purpose of the Commission will be to:<p>
<ul>
<li>Facilitate discussion of critical issues among policymakers, experts and stakeholders;
<li>Educate the public about those issues;
<li>Deliberate policy options to address the challenges to a secure retirement; and,
<li>Promote a blueprint of recommendations on what must be done.</ul>

<b><a name="structure">Organizational Structure</a></b><p>

	In order to provide credibility and visibility to the project, and to position the project's deliverables to be the basis of subsequent policy action, it is critical that this initiative be led by respected and knowledgeable leaders from both the public and private sectors.  CSIS will directly engage, on a bipartisan basis, leading members of Congress who have developed expertise in retirement issues, and with whom CSIS has long-established ties. <p>

	A critical aspect of the project will be the establishment of a high-level National Commission on Retirement Policy that will oversee the project.  Its leadership will include  key Members of Congress as Commission co-chairs: Senators Judd Gregg (R-NH) and John Breaux (D-LA), and Representatives Jim Kolbe (R-AZ) and Charles Stenholm (D-TX).  These members are ideally suited to lead this initiative.  Senator Gregg chairs the Senate Aging Subcommittee and will pick up the baton from former Senator Alan Simpson on Social Security reform.  In addition to serving in the Democratic leadership, Senator Breaux serves on the Finance Committee, which oversees Social Security and tax law.  Representatives Kolbe and Stenholm co-chair the House Pension Reform Caucus which has provided great leadership on this issue.  Two widely respected industry leaders, Donald B. Marron and Dr. Charles A. Sanders will serve as private sector co-chairs.  Mr. Marron is the chairman and chief executive officer of PaineWebber, Inc., one of the leading financial services firms in the country.  Dr. Sanders is the recently retired chairman of Glaxo, Inc, one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies.  The Commission itself will be comprised of 15-20 business leaders and public policy experts from around the country.<p>

	<a href="http://www.csis.org/html/4belt.html">Bradley D. Belt</a>, domestic policy director at CSIS, will be the executive director of the project.  He is former counsel to the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs and  also served as legislative director and general counsel to Senator John McCain.  Mr. Belt has written and lectured extensively on a wide-range of economic policy issues. Mark Weinberger, former chief of staff of the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlements and Tax Reform and chief tax counsel to former Senator Jack Danforth, will act as senior advisor and counsel to the project.  He has also written and lectured extensively on tax and economic policy issues.  They will be assisted by Greg D. Kubiak of the CSIS Domestic Policy program who previously worked as legislative director for Senator David Boren.<p>

	In addition to the direction from the Commission's Congressional and private sector leadership, the project will also draw upon the CSIS family of specialists and experts to assist with the effort, including the Center's Advisory Committee on Tax Replacement and the International Research Council.<p>


<b><a name="outreach">Public Education & Outreach</a></b><p>

	Critical to the success of this initiative -- in terms of ultimate policy impact -- is the design and implementation of  an aggressive outreach and public education campaign that will seek to inform the American electorate about the scope and magnitude of the problem and the costs and benefits of various policy options.  In this regard, the project will follow a three-pronged strategy: raise public awareness, stimulate dialogue for solutions, and build grassroots support on policy recommendations.  <p>

	Following establishment of the Commission, there will be an initial plenary meeting, open to the public and press, that will serve as the kick-off event for the project.  At this two-day symposium, recognized policy experts will discuss the critical issues that have to be addressed in order to avoid a systemic fiscal crisis.  These presentations will provide a broad review of the issues to be examined as the Commission prepares for the forums and roundtables that will take place around the country during the project's life span.<p>

	Approximately three to four months after the project's start, CSIS will raise public awareness with a pamphlet to graphically highlight the tremendous fiscal pressures associated with the pending retirement of the Baby Boom generation early in the next century.  This policy report will describe, in an easily comprehensible manner, the key economic and demographic trends that threaten to destabilize America's retirement system.  The format of the report ó from traditional brochure to the world wide web ó will be such that the general public will be able to understand the critical issues and challenges involved.  The ultimate goal will be to reach as broad an audience as possible, since retirement financing is a policy challenge that impacts everyone and requires a consensus for action that crosses both political and generational lines.<p>

	In a series of policy forums to be held around the country, the Commission will stimulate a public discourse about the issues relating to the retirement financing crisis and begin to build grassroots support for appropriate policy changes.  In regional forums and town hall meetings the project will involve diverse interests in building awareness and seeking politically realistic solutions to the challenges.  These will take place in the home state's of the Commission's Congressional leadership and other appropriate venues as a way to maximize media coverage.  The project will also raise the visibility of these issues "outside the Beltway" by engaging governors, state legislatures, mayors, and city councils in workshops, briefings, and seminars around the country. <p>

	Publications and media coverage will be an integral part of this entire process.  Experts and briefing materials should be made available to and through: talk radio, talk T.V., national news magazines, local newspapers, and the Internet.<p>


<b><a name="impact">Policy Impact</a></b><p>

	After building public support and knowledge and laying the intellectual foundation for consensus policy recommendations, the Commission will continue its deliberative process, working toward a final report with the goal of policy impact.  This essential element of the project will educate policymakers and opinion leaders about the issues.  To do this will require bridge-building between key constituencies and facilitating, coordinating, and leading current and new initiatives between CSIS programs and other outside organizations, including other think tanks and various trade and professional associations.<p>

	The substantive work of the Commission will be forums and roundtable discussions covering the full-range of issues on retirement financing, including the future of the pay-as-you-go Social Security system, the impending insolvency of the Medicare program, under funding and termination of certain corporate pension plans, the shift from defined benefit to defined contribution plans, and the inadequate levels of private saving and biases against such saving in the federal tax code.  The Commission will deliberate the issues and seek remedies and reforms that can be translated into legislation that can attract bi-partisan support and eventually be enacted.<p>

	With this final report, CSIS will aggressively promote the Commission's recommendations, much the way it did with its well-received <a href="http://www.csis.org/html/pubsecon.html#soa">Strengthening of America (SOA) Commission report</a>.  The release of the SOA Commission's report during the 1992 Presidential campaign served as a catalyst for the subsequent national policy debates on achieving a balanced budget by the year 2002 and replacing the current tax system with a new consumption-based tax system - two of the principal recommendations of the SOA Commission. <p>


<b><a name="timetable">Timetable</a></b><p>

	CSIS intends to announce the project during the early part of the first session of the 105th Congress.  The exact timing will depend on the arrangements and schedules of Congressional co-chairs and the agreement to participate by other Commission members.<p>

	By late March, the first plenary session with full Commission membership will take place in Washington, DC.  Its function will be to outline the issues and set forth the plans and objectives of the project.  The session will be a public hearing at which a variety of stakeholders and constituencies can discuss the magnitude of the crisis and provide input as to the appropriate course of action.  Working groups or subcommittees will be established and charged at this meeting.<p>


	In conjunction with or immediately following the first plenary session, CSIS will publish a descriptive brochure outlining the challenges to the future of retirement security.  The brochure will "paint the picture" of the impending crisis with  facts, figures, and graphic illustrations. <p>

	From late Summer through Fall 1997, the Commission will undertake a nationwide series of public forums to describe the challenges to retirement security and invite public input for potential solutions.  The Commission will then sponsor a series of public forums in Washington to examine the issues and policies affecting retirement in the 21st century.  This would occur between fall 1997 and January 1998.  Testimony will be taken from various experts in the field, covering each of the distinct components of the retirement financing crisis. <p>

	In Spring 1998, deliberative sessions of the Commission will be held to find consensus on a blueprint of legislative and policy options addressing retirement security.  It is then expected that by June 1998, a comprehensive, final report of the National Commission on Retirement Policy will be issued, with a strategic effort to maximize exposure to media outlets, Capitol Hill and the public.  Thereafter, CSIS will continue to monitor, follow-up and provide necessary leadership on the resulting recommendations from the Commission.<p>


<b><a name="plans">Plans for Continued Support</a></b><p>

	As with other similar initiatives, CSIS is committed to supporting the Commission's work on an on-going and active basis.  The CSIS Strengthening of America Commission is one example of the type of follow-through intended.  That commission was formed in January 1991, and its <a href="http://www.csis.org/html/pubsecon.html#soa">first report</a> released in September 1992.  As specific tax policy and health care reform recommendations were paramount in that report, two major reports were published to follow-up the effort:  <i><a href="http://www.csis.org/html/pubsheal.html#principles">Principles for Health Care Reform:  The Second Report of the CSIS Strengthening of America Commission</a></i> (April 1994); and <i><a href="http://www.csis.org/html/pubsecon.html#income">Replacing the Income Tax: Principles of a New Tax System</a></i> (January 1996).   Furthermore, the only, fully-conceptualized, bipartisan proposal to fundamentally reform the income tax was sponsored by the Commission's co-chairs, Senators Nunn and Domenici.  "The Unlimited Savings Allowance Tax of 1995," was co-sponsored by Senators Kerrey, Bennett and Dodd.  CSIS intends to be equally aggressive in pursuing appropriate policy changes.<p>

	In like manner, CSIS will continue to support the project's recommendations through activities that further the Commission's objectives.  This can be accomplished in a number of ways.  First, CSIS would maintain necessary working groups -- a gathering of experts from both within and outside of CSIS -- which would continue to study and monitor activities and issues associated with retirement security.  Furthermore, the CSIS Domestic Policy Program will continue to study the related issues and promote the ideals surrounding the Commission's goals.  This will occur through published studies and opinion/editorial pieces as well as policy forums and conferences.<p>


<b><a name="about">About CSIS</a></b><p>

	Over its 34-year history, CSIS has established a strong reputation tackling difficult national public policy challenges.  Pete Peterson, author of the acclaimed new book, <i>Will America Grow Up Before It Grows Old?</i>, recently stated that CSIS is uniquely well positioned to undertake a project of this kind to help think through the difficult transitions and form political coalitions critical to solving this problem.  First, we bring a track record of "policy impact" to the table.  It was CSIS that brought together the integral players, including four former Presidents and Secretaries of State, involved in the formation and passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) through our NAFTA and Beyond Commission. It was the CSIS Strengthening of America Commission that catalyzed the national policy debate on achieving a balanced budget by the year 2002 and replacing the current tax system.  There are numerous other efforts whose products can be seen in actions, recommendations and legislative proposals.<p>

	Second, CSIS has a reputation for bringing together recognized thinkers on critical domestic and international policy issues.  From the Congressional leadership already on-board this project to the diverse nature of other stakeholders, CSIS is well positioned to be a convener of experts and organizations and others to address this major challenge.  The involvement of bipartisan political leaders has long been a hallmark of CSIS policy work.  CSIS believes this effort must be broad-based, non-partisan, and independent to have the desired impact on policymakers.<p>

	Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this effort will look at the overall magnitude of the challenges to retirement security.  We enter this debate with no preconceived notions as to an outcome of the Commission's recommendations. While some policymakers and entities bring parochial views and narrow objectives to this debate, CSIS will look at the future of retirement in its totality.  Others limit their study to remedies for Social Security's insolvency, how tax reform might bolster savings, or other related issues.  The CSIS approach is panoramic, inclusive and aimed at policy impact.</td></tr> </table>

<h3><a name="defense21">Defense for the Twenty-first Century</h3></a><p>
 This effort is organized into a four-dimension project intended to take a comprehensive look at what must be done to provide a credible, capable defense of the nation, its interests, and its friends. The first dimension of the project extends the Political-Military program's early, ground-breaking analysis of the ongoing defense budget crisis. The second dimension focuses on defining the U.S. defense posture for the next century, following on the work done by CSIS in conjunction with the former Congressional House Wednesday Group. The third dimension is a re-examination of the 1947 National Security Act determining what changes in structure, organization, and national security planning processes and management are needed to face new threats and obligations. The fourth dimension capitalizes on the work accomplished in the Information-Based Warfare project described on page 18.<p>

<h3><a name="e4e">Enterprise for the Environment</h3></a> CSIS has launched this project to engage key stakeholders (business, environmental, labor), experts, and political leaders in an effort to build a consensus on systemic reform of the nation's environmental management system, encompassing the activities of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, other levels of government, and the regulated community. In 1996 and 1997, the initiative will conduct its work through a series of conferences and action group meetings and will deliver recommendations to the next administration and Congress.<p>

<h3><a name="fiscal">Fiscal Timebomb: America's Looming Retirement Financing Crisis</a></h3> America's "baby boom" generation will begin to retire soon after the turn of the century, threatening the solvency of federal retirement programs, including Social Security and Medicare. When combined with the continued erosion of pension plans and inadequate levels of private savings, the ability of future retirees to meet their post-retirement expenses and live comfortably is in doubt. To address the major public policy challenge, CSIS proposes to launch a new major initiative under the leadership of leading private sector executives and key members of Congress that will highlight the urgency and magnitude of this problem and develop concrete policy recommendation. The project would examine in detail all aspects of the looming retirement financing crisis, including solvency of the Social Security and Medicare programs, ERISA, corporate pension plans, and private savings. <p>

<h3><a name="missile">Missile Defense: Bridging Tomorrow's Technology Gaps Today</a></h3>
 CSIS has initiated a project that will study the technology needs of evolving missile defense architectures and identify international partners that can provide critical technologies in collaboration with the United States. In addition to receiving input from international partners, CSIS will explore congressional points of view on missile defense policy and technology and international collaboration.<p>

<h3><a name="undersea">Strategic Assessment of Twenty-first Century Undersea Warfare</a></h3>
The vast majority of submarine and undersea warfare analysis since the dissolution of the Soviet Union has focused on near-term trends and issues. This project will identify and assess long-term strategic trends to determine their potential impact on U.S. maritime and national security interests. The project will also assess the ability of the United States to counter future undersea threats to those interests and will suggest policy recommendations and undersea warfare force structure options to ensure their protection. <p>

<h3><a name="soa">Strengthening of America Commission - Chairman's Update</a></h3>
The Chairmen of the CSIS Strengthening of America Commission, Senators Sam Nunn (D-GA) and Pete Domenici (R-NM), will publish a report that assesses (1) to what extent the challenges outlined in the Commission's First Report have been addressed, and (2) the progress that has been made in implementing the recommendations of the Commission.  Given that various circumstances have changed since the First Report was published, the Chairmen will also make new proposals in their update. <p>

<h3><a name="taxforum">Tax Policy Forum Series</a></h3>
Through this series of roundtable discussion, CSIS brings together key policymakers, economists, business leaders, and tax experts to assess the impact that fundamental tax reform would have on specific industry sectors such as manufacturing, small business, financial services, and the housing industry. The forum also sponsored a debate by proponents of the leading tax reform alternatives, Senator Sam Nunn (D-GA), Senator Richard Lugar (R-IN), and House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-TX), and hosted a meeting of the Kemp Commission.  <p>

<h3><a name="dib">U.S. Defense Industrial Base: "Restructuring the Base" Working Group</a></h3>
This group provides a monthly forum for industry leaders and policymakers to discuss the evolution of the nation's defense industrial base during this time of declining defense spending. <p>

<h3><a name="mdb">U.S. Policy toward the Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs)</a></h3>
 The flow of official development assistance no longer conforms to the bipolar system of alliances. Moreover, public transfers have now been surpassed by private investment flows. To explore these changes and their implications, this project will generate a book-length critique of the U.S. policymaking process relating to the MDBs. In addition, the project will bring together policymakers in a task force cochaired by Senator Bill Bradley (D-NJ) and Representative John Kasich (R-OH) to look impartially at U.S. interests in the MDBs in terms of what MDB functions are currently needed and whether the MDBs are effectively performing them.  The task force will focus on two sets of issues about which significant concerns have been raised: (1) The ways and extent to which the functions of MDBs have changedóor should changeónow that private financial flows are much more readily available to developing countries that pursue sound policies; and (2) the role, if any, of the MDBs in poverty reduction and whether these institutions are currently pursuing effective strategies. <p>

<h3><a name="pme">U.S. Professional Military Education</a></h3>
This initiative engages a panel of experts and leading citizens, chaired by former secretary of defense Dick Cheney, to address issues about the education of U.S. military officers. With the post-cold war reductions of U.S. military force structure, there is concern that investment in human capital, particularly officer education, may suffer to provide funding for other needs.<p>

<h3><a name="incometax">U.S. Tax Policy - Replacing the Income Tax</a></h3>
 One of the principal recommendation of the CSIS Strengthening of America Commission was to replace the current federal income tax with a new consumption-based tax designed to encourage savings and investment. The Commission's work led to the introduction of the "Unlimited Savings Allowance" (USA) tax reform proposal in 1995 by Senators Pete Domenici (R-NM) and Sam Nunn (D-GA). CSIS continues to be actively involved in the national debate on fundamental tax reform. Members of the CSIS Advisory Committee on Tax Replacementórecognized experts on federal tax policyóregularly provide advice and counsel to members of Congress and groups such as the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform (the Kemp Commission). CSIS has also published a major policy report entitled "Replacing the Income Tax: Principles for a New Tax System," which describes the basic principles that should guide the tax reform debate. <p>

<h3><a name="innercity">Using Military Capabilities To Help Inner Cities/Urban Areas</a></h3>
 This project addresses the potential use of U.S. military capabilities, particularly the Reserve and National Guard components, to address the nation's inner-city problems. The project focuses on several issues: what needs to be done in the inner cities, what specifically the military can offer directly and indirectly via its training institutions, how should military support be coordinated, and the likely implications of such efforts for both the military and society. <p>

<h3><a name="change">Change and Renewal: Japan-U.S. Security Relationship into the Twentieth-First Century</a></h3>
The Pacific Forum CSIS, in collaboration with the Japan Institute for International Affairs, has convened two in a series of major conferences, in March 1995 and in January 1996, to address the viability and rationale of the bilateral relationship in the coming decade. Cochaired by James A. Kelly and Ambassador Nobuo Matsunaga, the conference brings together leading policymakers and scholars to investigate security and economic issues affecting the U.S.-Japan alliance. <p>

<p><hr><p>

<h3><a name="coop">Cooperation among Japan, China, and the United States on East Asian Security</a></h3>
Through a series of working groups and multilateral conferences in Tokyo, Beijing, Washington, D.C., and Hawaii, this three-year project will help air national security policies and strategies of the three countries and attempt to shape a better understanding of the national policies that are necessary for peace and stability in Northeast Asia. The Forum is undertaking this joint project with the Research Institute for Peace and Security in Japan and the China Institute for International Strategic Studies. <p>

<p><hr><p> 

<h3><a name="cscap">Council for Security Cooperation in the Asia Pacific (CSCAP)</a></h3>
In June 1993, the Pacific Forum CSIS and nine East Asian policy research institutes established CSCAP as the first regionwide organization to promote multilateral security dialogue. Activities have included the establishment of broad-based member committees in each country and international working groups on topics such as confidence and security-building measures (CSBMs), maritime security, and cooperative security frameworks. In addition, the forum manages the U.S. CSCAP committee, which convenes biannually in Washington, D.C., and both the international working group and parallel U.S. task force on CSBMs, which also hold biannual meetings. The CSCAP Steering Committee meets biannually, usually in Kuala Lumpur. <p>

<p><hr><p>

<h3><a name="human">Human Smuggling: The New Threat to America's Immigration Tradition</a></h3>
The growth of Asian migrant trafficking into the United States by smuggling organizations poses an array of problems that are too complex for law enforcement to solve alone. This project is examining the issues from a multidisciplinary perspective, including the "push" and "pull" factors of smuggling, as well as aspects of human rights, organized crime, international law, and U.S. immigration policy. Papers and analysis from a research conference convened in July 1996 will be published in a volume that sheds light on possible solutions. <p>

<h3>
<a name="wiseman">Korea: U.S.-Korea Wiseman Council</a></h3>
Co-organized by the Pacific Forum CSIS and the International Trade and Business Institute in Seoul, the council brings together a small, select group of senior individuals from both countries to exchange views and analyses on bilateral relations. The group's deliberations are conveyed to the Blue House and the White House and to cabinet secretaries. <p>

<h3><a name="schina">Regional Implications of Conflict in the South China Sea</a></h3>
Cosponsored by the Pacific Forum CSIS and the Manila-based Institute for Strategic and Development Studies, this project convenes experts from the region to examine the potential responses should military conflict occur between two or more of the six claimants to the Spratly Islands. <p>

<p><hr><p>

<h3><a name="usjapsec">Restructuring the U.S.-Japan Security Relationship</a></h3>
This two-year project deals with the changing rationale in Japan and the United States for the U.S.-Japan security relationship, as well as changing views throughout East Asia on this issue. Cosponsored with the Okazaki Institute and the Policy Study Group, the project involves young economic and political leaders and journalists in a series of seminars and conferences in Hawaii, Tokyo, and Washington, DC. A series of seminars is ongoing in the United States and Japan, including most recently a major bilateral conference in Washington in May 1996 to be <i>followed by a conference in Tokyo in January 1997. <p>

<h3><a name="seniorsem">Senior Seminar on Asia-Pacific Security</a></h3>
This seminar, held annually in Hawaii since 1993, brings together more than 25 civilian and military officials from the defense and foreign affairs ministries throughout the region for a week of debate and analyses on regional security issues. The seminar features lectures by senior experts, a crisis game, and informal discussions with the goal of developing new ideas to enhance regional security and forge new links among regional decision-makers. The Forum cosponsored the most recent seminar in April 1996 with the East-West Center and the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies. <p>

<b>WHY:</b>		<blockquote>How the United States will finance the future care of its senior citizens, especially when the Baby Boom generation begins to retire, is the most important and pressing public policy challenge facing the country.  Though several proposals have been advanced to address aspects of the retirement financing crisis, there is not yet a consensus on an appropriate and politically achievable course of action.<p>

			The mission of the National Commission on Retirement Policy is to build this consensus.  Guided by strong, bipartisan leadership from Capitol Hill and distinctive expertise from Commission members, the Commission will hold a series of roundtables, conferences, and townhall meetings in Washington and around the country.  It will seek to engage all affected constituencies, special interests, and the American public in a national debate about the scope and magnitude of the challenge facing the nation.</blockquote>
<p>

	<b>WASHINGTON, DC, JANUARY 29 --</b>  CSIS announced today the formation of the National Commission on Retirement Policy, a panel to be headed by strong, bipartisan leadership from both houses of Congress as well as leaders from the private sector.   The Commission will focus on four primary goals during its 18-month mission, as outlined at a U.S. Capitol press conference.  (1)  It will facilitate discussion of retirement financing issues among policymakers, experts, and stakeholders; (2)  activate a public education campaign about those issues; (3)  analyze policy options to address the impending crisis; and, (4)  build a political consensus around a blueprint of recommendations on what must be done.<p>

	"This challenge cannot be met without strong, bipartisan leadership," said CSIS President <a href="http://www.csis.org/html/4abshire.html"></a>David Abshire regarding the Commission's formation, "and we have that with the four Members of Congress who will help lead this effort."  Serving as Congressional co-chairs will be Senator Judd Gregg (R-NH), Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Aging and Chair of the Republican Retirement Security Task Force; Senator John Breaux (D-LA), Deputy Democratic Whip and Finance Committee member; and Representatives Jim Kolbe (R-AZ) and Charles Stenholm (D-TX).  Kolbe and Stenholm co-chair the 40-member bipartisan Public Pension Reform Caucus, which they founded in August 1995.<p>

	Joining the Members of Congress, as private sector co-chairs, will be Donald B. Marron, Chairman and CEO of Paine Webber Group Inc. and Dr. Charles A. Sanders, retired Chairman of Glaxo, Inc.  Mr. Marron noted, "Social Security as currently structured will soon fall victim to a powerful shift in demographics.  Our aim is to focus on public education and bipartisan legislative action that will reform the current system into an economically viable safety net for all Americans."  Mr. Marron brings over 45 years of leadership in the financial industry to the Commission.  His record of public service includes affiliations with such entities as the Council on Foreign Relations, Inc., the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, the Museum of Modern Art, the President's Private Sector Survey conducted by the Grace Commission and the New York Governor's Council on State Priorities.<p>

	Likewise, Dr. Sanders, brings established leadership credentials and a long record of public service to the Commission.  Dr. Sanders said, "The timebomb of our Social Security system, combined with our poor savings habits, threatens the promise of a secure retirement for our grandchildren and their children.  This initiative provides the means by which they may look forward to as good or better retirement than this generation will have."<p>

	The National Commission on Retirement Policy will hold a series of policy forums around the country to stimulate a public discourse about the retirement financing crisis and to build grassroots support for policy changes.  These and other mediums to raise the visibility of retirement issues will be a central focus of the project.<p>
	The objective, according to <a href="http://www.csis.org/html/4belt.html">Bradley D. Belt</a>, director of domestic policy at CSIS and the executive director of the Commission, is "to engage the American public, special interest groups, and all affected constituencies in a national debate on these issues."  The basic problem, he said, is that, "The government has promised too much and Americans are saving too little."  Noting that the imminent retirement of the Baby Boom generation and increasing life expectancy will strain the federal budget with higher Social Security and entitlement spending, Mr. Belt said, "It is critical that we begin to address our long-term structural deficit now rather than later." <p> 

	In a speech late last year, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan also pointed out the need to work on the challenge now. "We owe it to those who will retire after the turn of the century to be given sufficient advance notice to make what alterations in retirement planning may be required."  Mr. Greenspan continued, "The longer we wait to make what are surely inevitable adjustments, the more difficult they will become."	<p>

	While other efforts and recommendations have addressed Social Security's pending insolvency and other aspects of retirement policy, the initiative by CSIS brings new hope to the mammoth challenge.  First, it brings together a bipartisan commission of leaders and experts on retirement issues who will look at practical and politically viable solutions.  Second, it will study the entire range of issues impacting retirement income: Social Security, pensions, and personal savings.  And finally, after promoting broad-based educational initiatives to heighten awareness and after analyzing the constructive approaches forwarded by special interest groups and general members of the Social Security constituency, the commission will seek to forge the political consensus necessary to effect a comprehensive, responsibly funded retirement policy for the 21st century.<p>

	An Internet website has been established for the CSIS project and the National Commission on Retirement Policy: <a href="http://www.csis.org/retire/">http://www.csis.org/retire/</a><p>

	CSIS is a public policy research institution whose mission is policy impact.  It is located in Washington, D.C., with an affiliated Pacific Forum CSIS office in Honolulu.  Founded in 1962, CSIS now has a resident staff of 180.  Its work is nonpartisan and nonproprietary.<P>

<h3><a name="bridge">The China Telecom Bridge Project</a></h3> The project includes research, analysis, forums, and briefings on specific aspects of China's complex telecommunications, broadcast and computer-based technology, and service issues. It is unique in that it actively involves hands-on, senior-level Chinese officials with diverse international communications industry expertsótwo parties that have a stake in the role of communications in China's economic development. The project helped to create the Center for Information Infrastructure and Economic Development (CIIED), the first independent, nonpartisan research institution established in China involving policy experts from both Chinese government agencies and the international communications industry. CIIED is overseen by the International Advisory Board, cochaired by Dr. Liu Guoguang of CASS and Diana Lady Dougan of CSIS. The Advisory and Governing Boards are composed of key officials from the relevant Chinese ministries and commissions and diverse international communication industry leaders. <p>

<h3><a name="indiapol">Political Almanac on India</a></h3>
The composition of the new government in India reflects the dramatic shifts that have been taking place within the Indian landscape during the last decade, particularly the shift of political power from the center to the states. Given the complexity of Indian politics, the India program will produce a comprehensive, yet simple, political almanac of Indian politics, which will provide a useful reference source for those in the business community interested in investing in India. The almanac will describe the main national and regional political players and also analyze the political trends that have emerged in recent years at both the national and state levels and what they portend for the future. The main focus will be on state-level government, as these are the institutions that businesses will deal with when investing. <p>

<h2>Global Information<br>
Infrastructure Commission</h2><BR></center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
As the markets and applications for information technologies and services move beyond the limits of traditional institutions, resources, and geography, new frictions as well as new opportunities arise.  Little is understood about how these will evolve in a global context.  What was once the sole purview of government communications ministries (PTTs) and tidy monopolies in many countries is now shifting to private ownership and competitive forces.  This calls for new constructs for cooperation, coordination, and
leadership that cannot be met by governmental bodies, trade associations, or industry alliances.
<p>
The Global Information Infrastructure Commission was established in the summer of 1995 to meet this need.  The purpose of the GIIC is to promote private sector leadership and transnational cooperation in information infrastructure development.  Its goals are to advance economic growth, education, and quality of life in both developing and developed countries and to involve private and public sector leaders from a diversity of countries, industries, organizations, and fields of expertise.<p>
The GIIC's objectives are fourfold:
<ul>
<li>to provide a framework for marshaling private sector leadership in cooperation with governments;</li>
<li>to facilitate initiatives, research, and recommendations involving developing as well as industrialized countries;</li>
<li>to promote applications and demonstration projects in support of key areas such as education, health care, and the environment; and</li>
<li>strengthen the links and cooperation between various national information infrastructure task forces and industry initiatives.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Number 19,

December 10, 1996</h4>
<hr>
<h1>Subcontinental Divide</h1>

<h3>India has a bright economic future, but faces cloudy days in the interim . . .</h3>

 
Despite efforts by the United Front government to maintain growth since it took office six months ago, the Indian economy appears to have entered a protracted downturn.  According to CSIS India Project scholars, macroeconomic conditions in India tell the tale of an ailing economy struggling with declining production, a sagging export market, overburdened infrastructure, and a rising fiscal deficit.<p>  

Currently, the government's total domestic liabilities account for 58.8% of GDP, while some 46% of fiscal revenues are consumed by debt servicing.  Although generally cited at 5.7% of GDP, India's fiscal deficit is actually in the neighborhood of 10% of GDP when the country's federal, state, and public sectors are combined.  The trade deficit is expected to rise from $4.5 billion to more than $7 billion in 1996-97. <p>

Unchecked government spending continues to consume much of India's available domestic capital, in turn pushing interest rates higher and causing  experts to warn of an impending debt trap.  India's rate of inflation(hovering around 6.35%) is also on the rise, fueled by government spending and long-overdue price corrections, such as the government's recent hike in petroleum prices. <p>

<b>Industrial Growth:</b> Despite a buoyant 25% growth in turnover and profits last year, corporate India's meteoric expansion in 1995 was financed on borrowed time. With other critical macroeconomic fundamentals also depressed -- including low consumer demand, limited capital, and an overburdened infrastructure -- Indian industry found itself at the start of the current fiscal year with piling inventories and overdue receivables.<p>

<b>Exports:</b> Overall growth of Indian exports recorded a sharp drop in the first part of FY1996 declining to 9.8% for April-August 1996 compared with 30% for the same period last year.  For example, export of computer software fell to $10.2 million in April 1996, down some 63% from the corresponding figure of $27.4 million last year.  Based on the latest data, the Center for Monitoring the Indian Economy predicts that overall Indian exports will decline from 21% in 1995-96 to 13%.<p>

<b>Investment:</b> With the prospect of slower than expected growth prompting share sell-off, the BSE's benchmark index has lost nearly a quarter of its value since touching a high this past June.  In particular, foreign institutional investment (FII) dropped 25% for April-August 1996, the largest sell-off since India's economic reforms began.  In a recent report by Morgan Stanley, India ranked among the weakest emerging economies, down 8.2% in September and down more than 17% for the third quarter.  With India in need of some $8 billion in infrastructure investment this year alone, market conditions could well impede efforts to remove one of the principal impediments to the vitality of the Indian economy.<p>

Nonetheless, the United Front has taken a number of positive actions to attract investment and improve economic growth:  <p>

<ul><li>The Reserve Bank of India announced a 2% cut in the bank Cash Reserve Requirement, which will release $2.4 billion into the banking system over the next four months.  
<li>The government has cleared more than 500 projects consisting of foreign direct investment (FDI) worth $4 billion.
<li>In an attempt to lower the fiscal deficit, the United Front is pushing  public sector disinvestment, hoping to raise a budgeted target of around $1.4 billion in FY 1996-1997.  Many believe, however, that even half this target may not be met.</ul> <p>
    
In 1996, India is expected to receive FII inflows of  $3.5 billion, half the total inflows since financial markets were opened to FII in 1993.  Recent anouncements allow for investment by individual FIIs of up to 10% of the equity capital of investee companies, investment in unlisted companies, and an easing of restrictions on investments by FIIs in debt securities.<p>

Though the United Front government's stability and commitment to reform is still uncertain,  some analysts maintain that India's economic outlook is very positive.  Despite the slight slowdown, they note, the economy is fundamentally strong, exhibiting a trend toward better integration into global markets and an ability to attract significant FDI and FII in the coming years.

<h4>Number 14,

<h1>To Helms-Burton and Back</h1>

<h3>Two interpretations of America's Cuba policy</h3>

Two CSIS scholars are at loggerheads over the recent passing of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (LIBERTAD) Act of 1996 -- better known as the Helms-Burton Act. The bill, which tightens the economic sanctions against Cuba, is particularly controversial for its extraterritorial nature.  Ambassador Ernest Preeg doubts the legality and economic wisdom of the bill, while Dr. Georges Fauriol, director of the Latin American Studies program, believes it is a solid strike against the Castro regime.<P>

The bill has a number of notable provisions, which include the following:<P>

<UL><LI>   Title III, which  "makes any person that traffics in property confiscated by the Cuban Government on or after January 1, 1959 liable for money damages to any U.S. national who owns claims to such property."  The pressing question is how the term "trafficking" will be interpreted.  Preeg believes it will be defined as any new investment or expansion of an existing investment that occurs after passage of the bill (which became law on March 12).  It is estimated that Title III could bring billions of dollars in lawsuits to the courts.  The president, though, has the right to waive this for six months at a time in the name of national interest.  His timing will be significant in regard to the Cuban-American vote.  He could either waive the provision immediately or allow a few cases to begin beforehand to score points in Florida.<P>

<LI>   Title IV, which stipulates that any person (or immediate family) trafficking in the aforementioned property will be denied entry into the United States.  The rule could affect numerous businessmen, as well as many students currently in the United States.<P>

<LI>   Title I, the Russian aid provision.  It states that if the Russian government continues funding of a nuclear reactor or an intelligence listening station in Lourdes, Cuba, the United States will cut aid to Russia.  The president also can waive this provision within 90 days of passage, which he may well do so as not to enflame nationalist passions before Russia's June elections.<P></UL>

Preeg is concerned about the bill on a number of counts.  First, he thinks the extraterritoriality of the
bill is contrary to both WTO and NAFTA commitments.  The consequences will result in a loss of political clout and economic bargaining power in the global trading system. Already, Canada, Mexico, and many EU countries have threatened to retaliate. <P>

Although Helms-Burton will restrain investment by foreign companies, Preeg maintains it will have little effect on Castro's political control. In fact, Castro has seized the moment to whip up anti-American fervor on the island.  He has reigned in reforms and further repressed human rights.  This in turn increases the likelihood of violent transition in Cuba.<P>

In general, Preeg fears that Helms-Burton will only shackle U.S. foreign policy to a hard line stance, at the loss of U.S. business and political maneuverability.<P>

By contrast, Georges Fauriol views Helms-Burton as a sage political move.  Although the bill may not speed Castro's departure, it will force companies to decide between trading with the United States, the largest economy in the world, and a poor island of 11 million people operating under the failed doctrine of communism.  The diminutive size of the Cuban economy only reinforces the point, he asserts, that a few business opportunities should not affect U.S. foreign policy.<P>
Fauriol believes that the sanctions will only increase pressure on Castro, whom he perceives as having no real interest in improving relations with the United States.  Helms-Burton will further strain Cuba's ability to interact with the rest of the world, leading only to further isolation.  He doubts Cubans will gladly accept that predicament.  Although there is political support for Castro, it "doesn't mean there's a mandate to lead Cuba into the dark ages."<P>

He also foresees no long-term ill effects for the United States from the bill.  In spite of all the U.S.-Cuba tension of the past three decades, the United States remains a source of political prestige throughout Latin America.  What bitterness the United States may have engendered with Helms-Burton will quickly be swept away by the economic opportunities after Castro.<P>

<h1>Retooling in Africa</h1>

<h3>Perspectives on Zambian financial reform . . .</h3>


Can Zambia reverse its economic downswing to develop a successful market economy?  Judging from recent meetings hosted by the CSIS African Studies program, there are indications of hope. <B>Dr. Jacob Mwanza</B>, governor of the Central Bank of Zambia, commented on the state of affairs in his country's institutions, with varying levels of good news to report.<P>

Zambia's economic progress in the last five years is surprising.  When <B>Frederick Chiluba</B> took power in 1991, the government owned nearly 80% of the economy, the (hyper)inflation rate was hovering around 100%, the budget deficit was 12% of GDP, external debt was $7.1 billion and the country was stifled by price controls.  The new government attacked the myriad of economic obstacles with determination.  It created a flexible, easily administered tax code and established the Zambian Revenue Authority to collect taxes more effectively.  Top corporate and income tax rates were cut roughly in half, from 60% and 65% to 30% and 35%, respectively.  Tariffs were standardized and reduced, with maximum rates falling from 150% to 40%. <P>

Monetary policies were revamped.  Interest and exchange rates, once dictated by state policy, are now determined by the market.  The Central Bank significantly streamlined its operations, cutting its staff by 50%.  At the same time, the Banking and Financial Services Act expanded Central Bank authority to regulate the country's commercial banks.<P>

The fruits of reform began to appear in 1996: tax revenue collection tripled, and Zambia's persistent deficit turned into a surplus of 0.6% of GDP.  But none of these reforms will continue to produce results without capital, and capital means privatization.  The Zambian government has made a good start.  More than 140 formerly state-owned companies -- including sugar, cement, and beer companies -- have been privatized in the last two years.  Even Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines, the largest parastatal firm, is being sold to private
interests.  The government is beginning to improve the attractiveness of the investment climate -- whether it is enough to steady the nation's economy remains debatable.<P>

The state of affairs on the political side of the equation is not as encouraging.  Presidential elections will be held on November 18, and <B>Kenneth Kaunda</B>, the six-time former president and founder of independent Zambia, will be a strong contender if he is allowed to run.  His popularity stems from the people's disillusionment with the government's austere  economic reforms -- not from any successes he had in the waning years of his reign.  Nonetheless, the question of his candidacy may be moot. A recently passed law decrees that all presidential nominees must be third-generation Zambians -- and Kaunda's parents came from Malawi.  Such political wrangling has caused international criticism of Chiluba, leading some countries to withhold aid. <P>

Mwanza stated that the decisions confronting the new Chiluba government were stark. Economic reforms contributed to high unemployment and an increase in the cost of living for the poor, but the choice between continued drift with even greater poverty and reform with the hope of recovery was clear: reforms had to be undertaken whatever the short-term cost.  Now, as inflation has fallen to 28 percent and external debt has decreased to $6.2 billion, Zambia aspires to complete its transition to a full-fledged market economy.  With the economy forecast to grow 5.4% in 1996, aspirations may well become reality.  The country has made an amazing economic turnaround, according to <A HREF="http://www.csis.org/html/4freeman.html"><B>Constance J. Freeman</B></A>, director of African Studies at CSIS.  But it is not the first time it has done so.  Staying the course will be key and investors are acutely aware of that.

<h1>Requiem for the Intermediary?</h1>

<h3>Wall Street faces its future at a CSIS conference on finance & technology</h3>

We are about to witness a paradigm shift of proportions similar to that accompanying the introduction of the telephone, posited SEC Commissioner Steven Wallman during a recent CSIS conference on the intersection of finance and technology.  <P>

What has caused this shift?  The answer is information technology.  It has the potential to revise the way investors manage their money, how brokerage houses operate, how capital is mobilized, and how government regulates. Furthermore, the Internet is the first example of two-way mass communications - it combines the telephone's interactivity with the television's ability to transmit information to an audience of millions.  With it, huge amounts of data can be relayed around the globe instantaneously. <P>

<I>Infotech influx.</I>  Michael Brown, Microsoft CFO, addressed the dynamics of information technology.  He noted that computer memory, which used to cost $10,000 per million instructions per second (MIPS), is now only $2 per MIPS.  The dramatic decrease in costs, combined with ever-shrinking cycle times, have caused massive changes in finance.  Some of the more powerful changes include:<P>

<I>Investor freedom. </I> As financial services expand over the internet, individuals will be able to invest their money at the press of a button, at a fraction of current costs.  Moreover, consumers will receive the same attention once only afforded to institutional investors.  There are drawbacks, however.  With freedom comes responsibility.  The former monitoring role of the financial intermediary will become the burden to the individual.  There will be other side effects.  For example, the price of some companies' stocks have fluctuated wildly based largely on the current buzz in electronic chat rooms.  The anonymity of the internet enables fraudulent information to circulate uncensored. <P>

<I>Intermediaries under pressure.</I>  If profit margins shrink interminably, and fewer companies utilize underwriters for their initial public offerings, what will happen to the financial intermediaries of today?  The threat of becoming an arcane institution looms, and many predict a diminished role.  But, as John Heimann of Merrill Lynch cautioned, it is dangerous to predict the death of the financial intermediary. The intermediary represents a value-added that would be difficult for any web site to offer.<P>

<I>Capital mobilization</I> stands to be drastically revamped.  After the success of Spring Street Brewery, which raised $1.6 million via its web site, numerous start-up companies are eager to use electronic means to find inexpensive financing.  Wallman pointed out one obstacle, though: while one start-up on the ënet is novel, when there are 14,000, few will receive the attention they desire.<P>

<I>Regulators under fire.</I>  When asked whether regulators were up to the task of monitoring tomorrow's financial markets, a consensus among panelists was an equivocal "no . . . maybe." <P>

The government will have a difficult time regulating and supervising the new global commerce.  With IPOs on the Internet, financial services merging and blending into one another, and new "exchanges" developing daily, it will be nigh impossible for regulators, with increasingly limited resources, to maintain order with laws created in the 1930s. As David Shaw, chairman, D.E. Shaw & Co. pointed out, regulators need to have the same capabilities and same understanding of risk management and technology that the private sector has.  But the track record of policymakers adapting regulation to market developments is not good.  Glass-Steagall reform, for example, has been debated since the mid-1970s.  Rep. Michael Oxley (R-OH) noted that recent legislative initiatives are only the first step in modernizing regulation.  According to Wallman, the next iteration of laws should be goals-oriented, affecting the end result of the transaction.  Thus, whatever blending of banking, securities, and insurance products that may occur will not render laws useless.<P>
------<P>
Elaine La Roche, managing director of Morgan Stanley, speculated, "The next five years will be more challenging than the last twenty."  For the most part, the United States is the sole country even beginning to take advantage of the new technological tools. The rest of the world will require years to catch up.  Nonetheless, Bradley Belt, director of the CSIS capital markets project, warned, "While it is almost certain that the U.S. capital markets will continue to be the market of choice . . . we must be careful to recognize and respond to the changing environment to ensure the continued health and vibrancy of U.S. markets."<P>

<font size="4">Excerpts: Statement by Secretary of State-Designate Madeleine K.
Albright before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
</font><br>
 <i>Washington D.C., January 8, 1997</a></i><p>

     We have reached a point more than halfway between the
disintegration of the
Soviet Union and the start of a new century.  Our nation is respected
and at peace.  Our alliances are vigorous.   Our economy is strong.  And
from the distant corners of Asia, to the emerging democracies of Central
Europe and
Africa, to the community of democracies that exists within our own
hemisphere, American institutions and ideals are a model for those who
have, or who aspire to, freedom. All this is no accident, and its
continuation is by no means inevitable.  Democratic progress must be
sustained as it was built -- by American leadership.  And our leadership
must be sustained if our interests are to be protected around the world. <p>

     Today, it is not enough for us to say that Communism has failed.
We must continue building a new framework -- adapted to the demands
of a new century
-- that will protect our citizens and our friends; reinforce our values; and
secure our future. In so doing, we must direct our energies, not as our
predecessors did, against a single virulent ideology.  We face a variety
of threats, some as old as ethnic conflict; some as new as letter bombs;
some as long-term as global warming; some as dangerous as nuclear
weapons falling into the wrong hands.<p>

     To cope with such a variety of threats, we will need a full range
of foreign policy tools.  That is why our armed forces must remain the
best-led, best-trained, best-equipped and most respected in the world.
And as President Clinton has pledged, and our military leaders ensure,
they will.  It is also why we need first-class diplomacy.  Force, and the
credible possibility of its use, are essential to defend our vital interests
and to keep America safe.  But force alone can be a blunt instrument,
and there are many problems it cannot solve.<p>

     To be effective, force and diplomacy must complement and
reinforce each other.  For there will be many occasions, in many places,
where we will rely on diplomacy to protect our interests, and we will
expect our diplomats to defend those interests with skill, knowledge and
spine.<p>

     Any framework for American leadership must include measures
to control the threats posed by weapons of mass destruction and terror;
to seize the opportunities that exist for settling dangerous regional
conflict; to maintain America as the hub of an expanding global economy;
and to defend cherished principles of democracy and law.  At the center
of that framework, however, are our key alliances and relationships.
These are the bonds that hold together not only our foreign policy, but
the entire international system.  When we are able to act cooperatively
with the other leading nations, we create a dynamic web of principle,
power and purpose that elevates standards and propels progress
around the globe.  This is our opportunity, for in the post Cold War era,
big power diplomacy is not a zero-sum game.<p>

<b>Promoting Mutual Security and Prosperity in Asia</b><p>
     America must remain a European power.  We must, and will,
remain a Pacific power, as well. Asia is a continent undergoing
breathtaking economic expansion and measured, but steady, movement
in the direction of democracy.<p>
Its commercial vigor reinforces our own and contributes to the vital
interest we have in its security.  This is, after all, an area in which
America has fought three wars during the past six decades, and in
which
100,000 American troops are based.<p>

     President Clinton has elevated this dynamic region in our agenda,
and I plan to devote much of my attention to its promise and perils.  Our
priorities here are to maintain the strength of our core alliances while
successfully managing our multi-faceted relationship with China.<p>

     Because of our commitment to regional security, we have
maintained our forward-deployed military presence in the Western
Pacific.  We are encouraging regional efforts to settle territorial and other
disputes without violence.  We are working hard to open markets for
American goods and services, both bilaterally and through APEC, which
the President lifted to the summit level.  We are broadening our diplomatic
and security ties in
Southeast Asia, home to the world's fastest growing economies.  And
we will continue to promote respect for internationally-recognized human
rights and the spread of freedom.<p>

     Our closest and most wide-raging bilateral relationship in the
region is with Japan, with whom we have strongly reaffirmed our
alliance.  We consult
Japan regularly on a broad range of foreign policy questions from
security in Asia to development in Africa.  We appreciate its generous
financial support for peace efforts from Bosnia to the Middle East.  And
we are working with Japan and another valued ally, the Republic of
Korea, to implement the Framework agreement freezing North Korean
development of nuclear arms.  In recent weeks, we and Seoul have
worked together successfully to reduce tensions, reinforce the nuclear
freeze and improve prospects for dialogue on the Peninsula.   I look
forward, if confirmed, to visiting both Japan and the Republic of Korea at
an early date.<p>

     I am also looking forward to the visit here soon of the Chinese
Foreign
Minister.  A strong bilateral relationship between the United States and
China is needed to expand areas of cooperation, reduce the potential for
misunderstanding, and encourage China's full emergence as a
responsible member of the international community. To make progress,
our two countries must act towards each other on the basis of mutual
frankness.  We have important differences, especially on trade, arms
transfers and human rights, including Tibet.  We have concerns about
Chinese policy towards the reversion of Hong Kong.  While adhering to
our one China policy, we will maintain robust unofficial ties with Taiwan.
But we also have many interests in common and have worked together
on issues including the Korean peninsula, crime, the global environment
and nuclear testing.<p>

     U.S. policy toward China has long been an issue of controversy
in Congress and among the American people.  There are disagreements
about the proper balancing of the various elements of that policy.  There
should no doubt, however, about the importance of this relationship, and
about the need to pursue a strategy aimed at Chinese integration, not
isolation.<p>
<b>
Vigorous Diplomacy in Support of Peace</b><p>
     The appropriate American role in helping to end conflicts and
respond to crises overseas has been debated widely, not only in our
time, but throughout American history. Because we have unique
capabilities and unmatched power, it is natural that others turn to us in
time of emergency.
We have an unlimited number of opportunities to act around the world.
But we do not have unlimited resources, nor do we have unlimited
responsibilities.  If we are to protect our own interests and maintain our
credibility, we have to weigh our commitments carefully, and be selective
and disciplined in what we agree to do.<p>

     Recognizing this, we have a strong incentive to strengthen other
mechanisms for responding to emergencies and conflicts, including the
United Nations and regional organizations.  We should work closely with
the entire network of public and non-governmental organizations that has
evolved to predict, prevent, contain and minimize the human and other
costs of natural and human-caused disaster.  And we should insist that
other capable nations do their fair share financially, technically and -- if
necessary -- militarily.<p>
<b>
Leadership for a Global Economy</b><p>
     The Clinton Administration has had extraordinary success these
part four years in creating jobs for Americans at home by opening
markets abroad.  The more than 200 trade agreements negotiated have
helped our exports grow by
34% since 1993 and created 1.6 million new jobs.  By passing NAFTA,
concluding the GATT Uruguay Round and forging the Miami summit
commitment to achieve free and open trade in our hemisphere by 2005
and the APEC commitment to do the same in the Asia-Pacific by 2020, the
President has positioned the United States to become an even more
dynamic hub of the global economy in the 21st century.  As Secretary of
State, I would do all I can to see that this momentum continues. <p>

     Competition for the world's markets in fierce.  Often, our firms go
head-to-head with foreign competitors who are receiving active support
for their own governments.  A principle responsibility of the Department
of
State is to see that the interests of American companies and workers
receive fair treatment, and that inequitable barriers to competition are
overcome.
Accordingly, the doors to the Department of State and our embassies
around the world are open -- and will remain open -- to U.S. business
people seeking to share their ideas and to ask our help.<p>

     In the years ahead, we must continue shaping a global economic
system that works for America.  Because our people are so productive
and inventive, we will thrive in any true competition.  However,
maintaining the equity of the system requires constant effort.
Experiences tells us that there will always be some who will seek to take
advantage by denying access to our products, pirating our copyrighted
goods or under pricing us through sweatshop labor.<p>

     That is why our diplomacy will continue to emphasize high
standards on working conditions, the environment and labor and
business practices.  And it is why we will work for a trading system that
establishes and enforces fair rules.<p>

P<b>romoting Freedom and Extending the Rule of Law</b><p>
     The representative of a foreign power said once that his country
had no permanent allies, only permanent interests.  It might be said of
America that we have no permanent enemies, only permanent principles.
 Those principles are founded in respect for law, human dignity and
freedom not just for some, but for all people. <p>

     If I am confirmed, I can assure you that the United States will not
hesitate to address frankly the violation of internationally-recognized
human rights, whether those violations occur in Cuba or Afghanistan;
Burma,
Belgrade or Beijing.<p>

     We will work with others to defeat the forces of international
crime and to put those who traffic in drugs permanently out of business.
We will pursue a hard line against international terror, insisting on the
principle that sponsoring, sheltering or subsidizing terrorists cannot be
regionalized; it is wrong; and those guilty should not be appeased, but
isolated and punished.<p>

     And we will continue to promote and advocate democracy
because we know that democracy is a parent to peace, and that the
American constitution remains the most revolutionary and inspiring
source of change in the world.<p>

<b>Conclusion</b><p>
     I have laid out some, but by no means all, of what I see as the
principal challenges and opportunities we will face over the next four
years.  Clearly, we have a lot to do.  We have a unique opportunity to be
partners in creating a new and enduring framework for American
Leadership.  In so doing, let us remember that there is not a page of
American history of which we are proud that was written by a chronic
complainer or prophet of despair.<p>

     We are doers.  By rejecting the temptations of isolation, and by
standing those around the world who share our values, we will advance
our own interests; honor our best traditions; and help to answer a
prayer that has been offered over many years in a multitude of tongues,
in accordance with diverse customs, in response to a common yearning.<p>

     That prayer is the prayer for peace, freedom, food on the table
and what
President Clinton once so eloquently referred to as "the quiet miracle of a
normal life."

<h1>Japan: Facing Down the Banking Crisis</h1>

<h3>The fallout of the banking crisis will transcend current financial troubles. . . </h3>

How severe is the ongoing financial decompression in Japan?  Very serious, according to four well-respected analysts who addressed the issue at the CSIS Washington Roundtable earlier this week.<P>

The magnitude of the banking crisis in itself is bad enough.  According to many estimates, the scale of the problem is some five times larger than the S&L crisis faced by this country.  And the resulting "deflationary dynamic" at work in Japan is unprecedented since the time of the Great Depression.<P>

But it could go beyond that.  The financial distress could easily generate new and perhaps unmanageable pressures on the current political alignment in Tokyo.  It could propel new and possibly nationalistic figures to the political fore and change popular attitudes about trade and finance in the process.  All this has major implications for the U.S. economy and exchange-rate policy, U.S.-Japan relations, and political and economic dynamics in Asia.<P>

At issue is what to do about 80 trillion yen (some $900 billion) in "problem" assets.  The government is faced with the prospect of a massive bailout, but the Japanese taxpayer and the Diet have served notice that they will not tolerate such a solution.  What, then, can the government do?  There is no good solution, argues David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services.  The government will have to assume some part of the assets.  On top of that, it will have to create far more generous tax allowances for loan losses--a new phenomenon that will be extremely hard to sell politically.<P>

In the end, the derivative effects of the banking crisis may be even more significant.  Susan Dentzer, chief economics correspondent of U.S. News and World Report, notes that the deflation is driving up unemployment quickly.  Accustomed to jobless levels at two percent, Japan now faces the prospect of a doubling of that rate in 1996.  That may not seem like much to Americans, but it is extremely significant to the Japanese; Dentzer suggests that rising unemployment and other dislocation generated by the deflation could strengthen distrust of trade and foreigners in general.<P>

Hale raises the possibility that economic nationalism could rise as a result of the financial distress.  Already, he suggests, there is some evidence of a political realignment in the appointment of Dr. Eisuke Sakakibara as the new director general of the International Finance Bureau in the Ministry of Finance.  In the past, Sakakibara has taken an aggressive position relative to the United States, including threats of financial retaliation in trade talks.<P>

How will these dynamics affect the United States?  Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International, points to potentially conflicting financial effects here at home.  Continued meltdown in Japan would impel Japanese institutions to pull money out of the United States, but the resulting loss of confidence in Japan would increase flows to the United States from elsewhere.  The probability of such a crisis is low, he stresses, but both sides need to be prudent.  Hormats also raises the possibility of the spread of the banking crisis to the United States through the interbank market.  If there were a large failure of a Japanese bank that owns a bank in the United States, it could lead to reverberations in the U.S. banking system.<P>

Michael Berman, president of Nomura Securities International, also points to a more cautious attitude by the Japanese in playing the U.S. markets, especially in the T-bill auctions.  In equities, bonds, and real estate, look for the Japanese to be sellers rather than buyers, he says.<P>

There was general agreement that the financial woes in Japan are putting the spotlight on vulnerabilities not only in its banking system, but also in the regulatory framework and the tax code.  The restructuring necessary to address these vulnerabilities is a tall order, and it is by no means clear whether the current political leadership in Japan is up to the task.  Until it is, however, the decompression will continue.<P>

This report examines ways in which corporations can play a more proactive role in community building. More specifically, what role can corporations assume in filling the resulting leadership gap_at the local, national, and international levels_given cross-border economic, cultural, technological, and informational transactions that have made the task of governing more difficult?

This report represents the culmination of a two-year study on U.S. foreign policy. Prompted by the absence of any comprehensive U.S. foreign policy agenda for the post-Cold War era, the report describes the kind of world the United States should be moving toward and suggests how it should go about doing so. <p>

	The study group assessed trends, defined and prioritized U.S. national interests, and formulated policy recommendations in the geographic areas of greatest strategic importance to the United States_Asia, Europe, Russia and the Newly Independent States, and the Middle East_and in three functional areas as well: international security, international economics, and "global problems and opportunities." The report provides a uniquely bipartisan perspective and a much needed wake-up call at a time of diminished public interest in international affairs.<p>

"A bipartisan panel of foreign policy experts says America should strengthen its global leadership and overcome an unfocused, divisive and partisan approach to international affairs. . . . Beyond all else, strong presidential leadership in international affairs will be the critical prerequisite for the kind of world we would like to pass to future generations', says the 160-page study released this week by the Center for Strategic and International Studies." - Gene Kramer, Associated Press, AP Online, October 4, 1996<p>

<a href="http://www.csis.org/html/4preeg.html">Ernest H. Preeg</a><p>
The study relates longer-term Haitian development prospects to short-term U.S. policy objectives. The analysis focuses on the powerful demographic forces at play -- rapid population growth in the countryside, the relentless rural/urban migratory flow, and building pressures for outward migration to the United States. The central policy conclusion is that foreign policy actions, such as the international embargo to help restore the Aristide presidency, can have a devastatingly negative impact on the demographic and development outlook.<p>

Religion plays a crucial role in many international conflicts, yet for the most part, diplomacy either ignores or misunderstands that role. This unified collection of case studies and theoretical pieces attempts to restore this missing dimension to its rightful place in the conduct of international diplomacy and offers the first systematic account of modern cases in which religion has played a role in preventing or resolving conflict and achieving nonviolent change. A distinguished roster of scholars gives examples from Europe, Central America, Asia, and Africa. Additional essays bring out the implications of these case studies for foreign policy and the religious community.<p>

"Anyone concerned about the causes of failed American diplomatic efforts in Vietnam, the Lebanon civil war, Iran and the Sudan, or eager to know the behind-the-scenes successes of what Joseph Montville has called "Track II Diplomacy" in Rhodesia, the Philippines, and in post-World War II France and Germany, will find this book a fascinating and exciting read." - The Social Contract <p>

<h3><a name="fourhorsemen">U.S. Foreign Policy and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse: Humanitarian Relief in Complex Emergencies</a></h3>
Andrew S. Natsios<p>
The incidence of complex humanitarian emergencies has been accelerating since the late 1980s. Two U.S. presidents have committed military forces to five of these emergencies_Kurdistan, Somalia, Bosnia, Rwanda, and Haiti. U.S. bilateral aid in response to foreign disasters and crises rose from $300 million in 1989 to more than $1.3 billion in 1994. Without strong, effective U.S. leadership, such emergencies will result in great loss of life and permanently paralyze social systems. In the post-Cold War world, the U.S. national interest must be redefined to include complex humanitarian emergencies even when no geostrategic interest exists. Natsios recommends this redefinition involve a national debate of the kind that reevaluated the U.S. role in the world after World War II.<p>

<H2>The Succession in Russia and Western Business</H2>

<H4>by
<a href="http://www.csis.org/html/4bush.html">Keith Bush</a></H4></center><HR>


Thanks to unprecedented disclosure by Russian and foreign medical doctors, the world learned more about President Boris Yeltsin's condition than it ever did about the health of any Soviet-era leader. According to the director of the medical center of the president's main administration, Mr. Yeltsin was suffering from ischemic disease, angina pectoris, cardiosclerosis, post-hemorrhagic anaemia, and thyroid disfunction. On November 5, the president underwent multiple heart bypass surgery. The official prognosis is that he should return to full health and vigor by February 1997. Many Russians, however, are not convinced: they expect the president, if he survives the immediate aftermath of the operation, to be a part-time head of state for many months or years to come, appearing in carefully edited film clips and having decrees signed for him. Few expect him to serve out his four-year term. It is hardly surprising, therefore, that the race to succeed the ailing president has started.<p>
If  Yeltsin dies shortly after surgery, there are currently four horses in the race to succeed him: two - Lebed and Chernomyrdin - are leading the field with the two
others - Zyuganov and Luzhkov - close on their heels. A fifth figure - Chubais - may play a key role. 

<b>Aleksandr Lebed.</b> This formidable ex-paratroop general has been in politics for less than two years, and yet polls taken before his ouster showed him to be by far the most trusted political figure in Russia. Lebed is given to uttering apocalyptic assertions on a whole range of domestic and foreign issues to the media. He or his aides then often discount the quotation or deny that any interview has taken place. If a presidential election were held tomorrow, Lebed would surely win, given his current popularity ratings. But it will not be held tomorrow: indeed, the earliest conceivable date is February 1997. In the meantime, Lebed lacks a nationwide organizational base, with only the Congress of Russian Communities, the Truth and Order, and Honor and Motherland movements to call upon. He lacks money, apart from a tenuous connection through General Aleksandr Korzhakov to funding from the arms export business. And he lacks sympathetic access to the media, with all three main TV channels savaging him after his dismissal. Lebed as president could be disquieting news for the West. The blunt and outspoken general is unpredictable, and he has changed his position on many sensitive issues such as Chechnya, NATO expansion, Bosnia, and trade with the West. He has little grasp of economics and relies heavily on Sergei Glaziev, his economic aide and former head of the economic security department of the Security Council. Almost single-handedly, Glaziev emasculated the Production-Sharing Agreement before it was passed by the Duma in the runup to the December 1995 election. He has campaigned tirelessly for the reduction in the number of sites open to commercial exploitation by Western firms, and he has called for protecting the domestic agricultural sector and the military-industrial complex through further subsidies. Foreign direct investment would probably remain at a low level under a Lebed administration, especially if Glaziev were given a key post.<p>

<b>Viktor Chernomyrdin.</b> The 1993 Constitution stipulates that, in the event of the president's death or his "long-lasting inability to exercise his duties owing to his state of health," the current prime minister shall assume the duties of acting president and shall order a new presidential election within 90 days. Thus, if Boris Yeltsin dies or is clearly incapacitated, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin will become acting president for up to three months. During that period, he could do a great deal with the powers of incumbency combined with the financial backing of leading industrial firms and banks. He lacks charisma and is a poor speaker, and his well-heeled bloc, Our Home is Russia, captured only 10.3 percent of the vote in the December 1995 parliamentary elections, against 22.7 percent for the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF). In recent opinion polls he has hardly appeared in the spectrum. Chernomyrdin is nevertheless seen as a reassuring, competent, managerial figure. He is certainly the candidate favored by governments and business interests in the West, where he is a known quantity, having established close ties with the U.S. administration through the activities of the Gore-Chernomyrdin Commission. As president, he could be expected to oversee the continued slow and erratic progress toward a democratic system and a market economy.<p>

<b>Gennadii Zyuganov.</b>  After it was disclosed that President Yeltsin had suffered a heart attack or a stroke prior to the July 3 presidential election runoff, the leader of the National Patriotic Union of Russia (which embraces the CPRF) has repeatedly complained that the election was unfair because the electorate did not know they were voting for an inoperative candidate. He certainly has a point. In a recent poll, 65 percent of the respondents said that they would not have voted for Yeltsin had they known about his condition. Despite his loss of ground since July, Zyuganov has made it clear that he will run again for president, hoping to keep the support of the 30 million who voted for him on July 3 and adding many of the 40 million who voted for Yeltsin but who have since become even more disenchanted. Despite the CPRF candidate's reassuring words to Western investors and business executives during the first half of 1996, a Zyuganov presidency would be catastrophic for the Russian economy. His manifesto implied attempts to restore central planning, widespread nationalization, controlled retail prices for staples, protection for agriculture and heavy industry, a foreign trade monopoly, and huge subsidies. The attempts would fail, but the already faltering transition toward the market would be set back by several years.<p>

<b>Yurii Luzhkov.</b> The mayor of Moscow has not officially thrown his hat into the ring, but he has spoken and acted in recent months remarkably like a candidate for the highest office. Luzhkov has done a great job in transforming the city from a decaying and shabby Soviet-style metropolis to something beginning to resemble a capital city. He is appreciated for his hands-on style and won 90 percent of the vote in the mayoral election on June 16. Because he has run Moscow so well, he has been given a free hand in privatizing the enterprises and real estate there, with a program running counter to the nationwide privatization effort of Anatolii Chubais. It is uncertain how much support he could attract from the rest of the country. He can certainly call on massive financing from financial and business circles and is in a position to be kingmaker, even if he delays his own run for the presidency for a few more years. Some of his recent utterances on topics like Sevastopol and Chechnya and his ruthless crackdowns on dark-skinned merchants and the homeless suggest that he would make an assertive and forceful president, but he has done much to attract foreign capital and business to his own city.<p>

<b>Anatolii Chubais.</b> This impressive economist was the only leading reformer of the original Gaidar team to survive in high office as head of the privatization program throughout most of the Chernomyrdin administration. In January 1996, he was fired by Yeltsin, ostensibly for losing the parliamentary elections because of the inequities of the privatization process. He soon regained Yeltsin's favor and, in personal collaboration with Yeltsin's daughter, Tatiana Dyachenko, brilliantly managed the president's reelection campaign. For this he was rewarded with the position of chief of staff_a key function in a part-time presidency. Chubais is generally seen as an unlikely candidate for the presidency in the short term because of widespread disenchantment with the privatization program, but his position gives him great scope for influencing the contest and positioning himself for high office at a later stage. He has repeatedly spoken in favor of increased foreign investment in Russia and for improving the environment for Western business ties. <p>

What cannot at present be determined is the possibility or probability of alliances between the leading candidates. There have been rumors, for instance, of an accommodation between Chernomyrdin and Zyuganov. Other reports speak of a Chernomyrdin-Luzhkov alliance. And whereas Lebed has vowed that there can be no return to the past and has frequently been critical of Zyuganov, in his most recent utterances the former general seems to have spared the National Patriotic Union of Russia and its leader. It might also be recalled that Lebed was outspokenly dismissive of Yeltsin until a few weeks before the first round of the presidential election on June 16.  <p>

The West, of course, has no say in who will succeed Boris Yeltsin. Indeed, well-meaning intervention by international agencies such as the International Monetary Fund can backfire. Foreign assistance programs can, however, continue to help Russia develop democratic institutions and the market infrastructure in the hope that any succession that takes place does so within a constitutional framework. Under present circumstances, the most desirable outcomes from the point of view of the West probably would be a Boris Yeltsin restored to health and vigor, a Yeltsin figurehead regime with Chernomyrdin managing the store, or, failing that, a Chernomyrdin presidency in which Chubais and like-minded colleagues play a major role. In contrast, a victory for Lebed or Zyuganov would mean that all bets are off.

<a name="Overview"><h4>China Bridge Program Overview</h4></a>
The CSIS International Communications Studies Program (ICS) has established a special in-depth project focused on China.  It draws on the ICS Program's extensive experience and track record in assisting government and industry leaders in addressing the economic, political, and technological challenges of electronic communications worldwide.
<p>
The CSIS China Telecom Bridge Project includes research, analysis, forums, briefings, and study tours on specific aspects of China's complex telecommunications, broadcast, and computer-based technology and service issues.  The China Bridge project is unique in that it actively involves hands-on, senior level Chinese officials with diverse international communications industry experts.  Designed to be a two-way street, the China Bridge Project benefits both policymakers in China and international companies that have a stake in the role of communications in China's economic development.
<p>
The targeted analysis, briefings, and forums go beyond traditional avenues of information sharing, research, and analysis.  This special CSIS project has become an interactive "bridge" between policy and market decision-makers.  In the process it provides unparalleled opportunities for top-level industry and government interaction on the broad range of technology, policy, and investment issues affecting China's complex and fast-growing market both internally and externally.
<p>
The China Telecom Bridge Project's purpose is threefold:
<ul>
<li>to provide a framework for senior-level information exchange, analysis, and discourse involving diverse international industry experts and relevant Chinese officials;</li>
<li>to assist in developing policies and initiatives that promote the effective roles of information technologies and services in support of China's integration into the global market economy; and</li>
<li>to enhance domestic and foreign understanding of diverse telecommunications, computer, and broadcast applications and services in China.</li>
</ul>
<a name="Interaction">
<h4>Unique Government Industry Interaction</h4></a>
The China Telecom Bridge Project capitalizes on the momentum generated by the highly successful "China Telecom and Information Industry Forum" (CTIIF) that CSIS convened in Beijing in 1993 and 1994.  These CTII Forums and workshops brought together for the first time in history senior industry leaders from the United States, Europe, and Japan with more than 60 Chinese officials for in-depth discussions on key aspects of China's communications industries and policies.  These included numerous aspects of government policy, plans for telecommunications, and broadcast-based networks and services, electronic commerce, manufacturing, and standard setting, as well as long-term investment involvement of foreign corporations.
<p>
The impact of the CSIS China Telecom Bridge Project is already measurable.  At the invitation of the prestigious Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), the CSIS International Communications Studies Chair was invited in 1994 to establish a permanent center in China.  Because CASS works directly with the State Council, plays a key role in China's overall economic planning process, and has institutes in every Chinese province, it is uniquely suited to extend the "bridge" capabilities to a strategic diversity of constituencies in China.  The new Center for Information Infrastructure and Economic Development (CIIED) was announced at the Great Hall of the People in November l994 and officially commenced work in the summer of 1995.
<p>
<a name="Capabilities"><h4>China-Based Capabilities</h4></a>
The <a href="http://www.csis.org/html/ics/2ciied.html">Center for Information Infrastructure and Economic Development (CIIED)</a> is the first independent, nonpartisan research institution established in China involving policy experts from both Chinese government agencies and the international communications industry.  CIIED provides an on-the-ground Beijing base for corporate members of the CSIS China Telecom Bridge Project.  CIIED is overseen by the International Advisory Board cochaired by Dr. Liu Guoguang of CASS and
<a href="http://www.csis.org/html/4dougan.html">Ambassador Diana Lady Dougan</a> of CSIS. <a href="http://www.csis.org/html/ics/advboard.html">The Advisory Board and Governing Council</a> are composed of key officials from the relevant Chinese ministries and commissions and diverse international communication industry leaders.

In addition to its own targeted work, the CSIS <a href="http://www.csis.org/html/ics/chinteam.html">China Telecom Bridge Team</a> works directly with CIIED in undertaking specific projects on issues relevant to the roles of telecommunications, broadcasting, and information technologies in the context of diverse aspects of China's economic policies and plans.  At its initial meeting in June 1995, the CIIED Advisory Board and Governing Council concluded that the lack of clarity on current policies and processes is a major impediment in China.  Accordingly they recommended, as a first priority, that CIIED develop a comprehensive "Overview of China's Information Infrastructure Policy Process, Networks, and Services."
<p>
This initial year-long <a
href="http://www.csis.org/html/ics/chinares.html">research project</a> that began in June 1995 will be completed in three phases: (1) documentation and inventory of China's telecom industry, policies, and regulations, and analysis of the current policy responsibilities of government bodies; (2) assessments of new telecom plans and initiatives in targeted provinces; and (3) comparative analysis of policies and plans in other countries.
<p>
Phase one of the project, data collection and preliminary analysis, was completed under the supervision of Professor Zheng Youjing of CIIED and involved three full-time researchers and representatives of 15 ministries and commissions.  A draft report was reviewed by the CIIED Board at its March 1996 meeting and was followed by a series of workshops and review sessions involving corporate members of the CSIS China Telecom Bridge Project.  Phase two and three will include extensive interaction with international experts under the auspices of the CSIS China Telecom Bridge Project.  Given the unprecedented cooperation that CIIED is receiving from all the important government entities involved in electronic communications, the project promises to provide an invaluable framework for follow-on research and analysis in specific areas.

<a name="briefings"><h4>On-Site Briefings and Other Special Initiatives</h4></a>

In March 1996, CIIED joined with the Ministry of Electronics and Industry and the People's Bank of China in helping to organize the <a href="http://www.csis.org/html/2giic.html">Global Information Infrastructure Commission</a> "Challenge Hearing" on Electronic Commerce.  The forum focused on regulatory, policy, and legal issues of EFT, EDI, and other electronic technology applications worldwide.  CIIED also helped organize the senior-level seminar on Constructing a Global Electronic Commerce Strategy at PBC, which brought together some 50 senior officials and industry people from China and other countries to address global electronic commerce strategy-related issues and to initiate cooperative efforts to meet the challenges of the electronic age.  In the same month, the CIIED Advisory Board plenary meeting, held in Beijing, reviewed past CIIED activities and planned future endeavors.
<p>
CIIED is planning several special initiatives for CSIS Telecom Bridge Corporate Sponsors and the founding Corporate Members of CIIED.  One of the initial focus projects planned for the summer 1996 is on "Policy, Financial, and Technology Challenges in the Western Provinces."  As part of this, CIIED will conduct special briefings and a study tour to targeted provinces of interest to Corporate Members.  Included will be in-depth sessions with key provincial officials.  Participation will be limited to Corporate Members of CIIED.
<p>
Contingent upon funding, other planned activities include special guest lectures, workshops, and the <i>CIIED Quarterly</i> which will publish articles, interviews, and reports on key information infrastructure-related issues.  The journal will be circulated to relevant ministries and agencies at the provincial and national levels.  CSIS has also been invited to coordinate a management training program in the United States for chief executives heading both large city and provincial Telecom Bureaus across China.

<h3><a name="amerukra">American-Ukrainian Advisory Committee</a></h3>
 Under the chairmanship of CSIS Counselor Zbigniew Brzezinski, an informal group has been established to identify opportunities for closer political and economic cooperation between the two countries. The committee, which meets at least once a year, makes concrete recommendations at the highest political level to the two governments to assist Ukraine in consolidating its independence and in undertaking the transition to a market economy. The third meeting of the committee, held in New York in November 1995, focused on furthering Ukrainian economic and financial reform and improving the climate for foreign investment by inviting U.S. business leaders to the deliberations. The next meeting is scheduled to take place in Kyiv in October 1996. <p>

<h3><a name="cbsbalkan">Corporate Briefing Series (The Balkans and Central Europe)</a></h3>
 The East European Studies Project has launched this initiative to describe, clarify, and analyze the developments in the region most pertinent to the business community. The series focuses on two areas of Europe: the Balkans and Central Europe. The "Balkans Assessment" component is organized to provide crucial information on the Balkans, especially the former Yugoslavia. The "Emerging Markets of Central Europe" component is designed to cover developments in Central Europe (Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and Sloveniaóa market of some 67 million persons) for the business community by providing up-to-date assessments of political developments as they affect local economies; relations with Western institutions, including prospects for EU membership; regional security issues and their impact on investment; and identification of potential threats and risks. <p>

<h3><a name="democracy">Democracy Forum in Sarajevo</a></h3>
 The East European Studies Project, working with on-ground facilitators in Bosnia-Hercegovina, is convening a three-day Democracy Forum in Sarajevo in October 1996. The Forum, consisting of six focused workshops, will assemble nongovernmental representatives from the diverse regions of Bosnia, including both the Bosnian Federation and the Serb Republic, to determine priorities for developing a pluralistic, civic society in Bosnia and to help establish concrete joint initiatives. Among the planned initiatives will be a proposal to establish an NGO Coordinating Center in Sarajevo that would facilitate the development of independent civic activities throughout the country. <p>

<h3><a name="transarms">European Studies Working Group on Transatlantic Arms Sales to Third Countries</a></h3>
 This group will examine whether there can be some agreement in the United States as to what can be done to regulate such sales in coordination with our European allies. Second, assuming an agreement, can it be made more compatible with the Europeans' preferences and needs? Third, if this can be achieved, can the agreement be enforced in such a way as to be extended to other countries that are making indiscriminate weapons sales their new growth industry? <p>

<h3><a name="neweurope">New European States</a></h3>
This project, established in January 1995, examines the challenges facing the countries of Central EuropeóPoland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, and Sloveniaóas they aspire to membership in European political, economic, and security structures. The profound and wide-ranging implications of EU expansion and NATO enlargement have not been adequately addressed by the governments and institutions concerned. To address these issues, the East European Studies project at CSIS will build on the work already begun by continuing its roundtable meeting series involving a broad array of Washington-based participants from the government, NGO, diplomatic, corporate, and policy institution communities. The project will also conduct in-depth political assessment missions to the region and cooperate closely with two independent policy institutions: the Libra Institute in Ljubljana, Slovenia, and the Foundation to Support Local Democracy in Bratislava, Slovakia. As a companion to the project, CSIS produces the Central Europe Roundup, a monthly brief on political and economic events designed to cover issues that will have a significant impact on the region's development.  <p>

<h1>Investing in India</h1>

<h3>Patience is a virtue . . .</h3>


Tarun Das, director-general of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), is widely considered to have his fingers on the pulse of India's economy and government.  At a CSIS India Program meeting, he had a message for U.S. businesses: Invest in India, but be prepared for the long haul.

To outsiders uneasy with the fragility of the nation's United Front coalition government, Das emphasized that even if the government collapses, economic policy will not.  "The most encouraging thing for Indian businesses today is that no matter what party is in power, there will be continuity in economic policy."  Despite the rhetoric, all parties know that the economy must continue to open.<P>

Following the unveiling of a new budget on July 22, CII, India's largest industry and trade association, has projected that GDP will grow by 7.5 percent and industrial output by 13 percent for fiscal year 1996-1997, and that by the year 2002 India should see 9 percent GDP growth and 15 percent industrial growth. <P>

<B>Deficit is Primary Concern</B><BR>
But the economy won't take off if the government can't cut spending.  Das acknowledged that the fiscal deficit is the primary concern.  India's reformist finance minister, P. Chidambaram, aims to reduce the deficit to 5 percent of GDP this year, but most experts doubt he'll reach his target.  The deficit will keep interest rates high, liquidity tight, and businesses hesitant.<P>

<B>Public Sector Reform</B><BR>
Because the budget anticipates greater spending, particularly for social programs, the government is relying on raising most of its revenue through foreign investment.  It also plans limited privatization and streamlining of public sector enterprises through a newly constituted Disinvestment Commission.  But what the government did not do was to open up the insurance sector to private investment, a move that was widely anticipated in Chidambaram's budget.  "We need insurance opened up for Indian business," not just for foreign investors, Das says.  India needs to mobilize private savings for development, particularly in infrastructure.  The new government, in power for less than two months, felt it could not formulate an effective policy to privatize insurance in time for this budget.  But, according to Das, it will be done by the next budget, only six months away.<P>

On banking sector reform, Das acknowledged that deregulation has not gone far enough, but said that Chidambaram will open up the banking sector and allow increased licensing of foreign banks.  Meanwhile, telecommunication liberalization has been a "very stop, go, fall, get up, fall again process" but he sees a "new political will to take this deregulation further." <P>

<B>Foreign Investment</B><BR>
India aims to attract US$10 billion in FDI per year, up from $4.5 billion last year.  Das thinks the goal is achievable: "It is going to happen if we get our policies right.  There are investors out there, and there is a market in here."  The Foreign Investment Promotion Board has been restructured to spur faster clearances of foreign investment proposals; 64 foreign investment projects were approved August 7.  In addition, the government has promised to expand the list of industries that can have 51% foreign equity holding.  The markets, however, do not seem as optimistic about the pace of reform: stocks fell after the budget came out, and the important BSE index has fallen 12 percent since July 22.<P>

<B>The States</B><BR>
As foreign investors deliberate where to invest in India, the country's 25 states are vying for attention.  "Increasingly, the states are free to promote investment, develop infrastructure, give approvals, and market themselves," Das says. The greater devolution of authority made possible by the current government means that foreign businesses should evaluate the states individually.  Traditional investor-friendly states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Karnataka have been joined by previously less active Orissa and Andhra Pradesh in their hunt for foreign dollars.<P>

Das cautioned, "In India, whether it's infrastructure or other economic issues, please don't expect miracles tomorrow.  It's going to be a slow, steady process with a lot of questioning, a lot of debate, a lot of discussion. . . . I always advise my U.S. business visitors to be patient because the market is going to grow and grow and grow."<P>

William Clark, Jr., director of the CSIS India Program, termed Das' speech "an upbeat, realistic view of India's mood and prospects."

<h4>Number 20,

December 17, 1996</h4>
<hr>
<h1>The Era of Entitlements</h1>

<h3>Unsustainable Promises </h3>

Amid the oft-cited statistics of doom surrounding the looming entitlements crisis, there have been few offers of practical solutions. A recent panel at CSIS, however, had much to say about the situation and many suggestions on how to fix it.  The group -- consisting of Carla Hills as moderator, Pete Peterson of the Blackstone Group, Susan Dentzer, Senior Writer and Chief Economist, U.S. News & World Report, Judd Gregg, Senator (R-NH), and <a href="http://www.csis.org/html/4belt.html">Bradley Belt</a>, Director, Domestic Policy Program -- challenged policymakers to address the entitlement issue now, before the costs associated with change become too daunting.<p> 

The problem is a massive one.  America is aging rapidly.  Government population estimates predict a nation of Floridas: the United States will soon have 50 million people over the age of 85.  By 2030, entitlement spending will consume all government revenue.  Many see such problems as intractable, but there is some evidence to the contrary: only 30 years ago, the United States was not the earth's greatest consumer or borrower but its greatest creditor.  Also, it is unconscionable to abandon future generations of Americans for the sake of the next 20 years.  The transformation that must occur will require significant changes in American culture -- first and foremost, increased savings. <p>

Without structural reforms, the country faces a Hobson's Choice: Should it raise taxes to support the current system of benefits, or should it reduce benefits?  If it were to raise payroll taxes, the increase would have to be 35%-55% above current rates.  As to reducing benefits, a number of methods were discussed by the panel:<p>

<ul><li><b>Tinker with the system -</b> One step could be to raise the retirement age before baby boomers age their considerable numbers into senior citizenship.  In only the last 25 years, life expectancy in the United States has increased by 4 years.  By raising the age of retirement 3 months per year over 20 years, pension costs can be lowered significantly with little shock to the extant system.  Affluence testing is another manner by which costs can be brought down incrementally. <p>

<li><b>Mandatory savings accounts -</b> Inspired by the successful model of the privatized pension system in Chile, the panelists imagined forcing the population to prepare for its future. Proposals ranged from privatizing the surplus from Social Security (currently about 1% of the total fund) to the entire system.<p>

<li><b>Tax systems that encourage savings -</b> ¿ la the Nunn-Domenici Unlimited Savings Allowance (USA) tax plan, a progressive tax system that spurred savings and investment would contribute to warding off fiscal difficulties 30 years from today.<p>

<li><b>Recalibrate the CPI -</b> A partial  solution that came to the fore last week was  lowering the consumer price index (CPI) by as much as 1.1%.  The resultant saving would be significant in Social Security payments, debt payments, and more.  Some analysts, however, doubt that the overestimation of inflation is nearly so high.<p>

<li><b>Do nothing -</b> If the system is left as is, benefits will not drop to zero when the Social Security trust fund is empty 34 years from now.  Payroll taxes will still provide benefits at about 75% of today's levels.  Of course, this would require individual investors to save more to make up the difference.<p></ul>

As ill-starred as the Social Security system might be, the panel agreed that Medicare may fare worse. Costs are rising 10% per year, while government funding increases are down from 20% to 3%. The United States spends 6% more of its GDP than any other country on health.  Medical costs must be reined in, but the questions of how to "ration" health care and whether to cap costs are politically frightful.<p>

CSIS is tackling the issue of entitlements in an upcoming project directed by Belt.  A critical aspect of the initiative will be the establishment of a National Commission on Retirement Policy, composed of leaders from both private and public sectors.  The mission of the 18-month project will be to highlight the urgency of the emerging crisis and recommend comprehensive and politically viable remedies to address it.

<h1>Polish Elections</h1>

<h3>Business as usual?</h3>

In run-off elections held in Poland this past Sunday, Aleksander Kwasniewski, the leader of the Left Democratic Alliance (SLD), was elected to a five-year term as president.  Given the trend in Eastern Europe--former communists rising to high-level positions in government--the results were not really a surprise, notes CSIS Director of East European Studies Janusz Bugajski. <P>

Although the political landscape in Poland has changed--the coalition of former communists and the Polish Peasant party now control the presidency and government--it does not mean a revolutionary transformation in key policies.  Bugajski contends that "Kwasniewski's victory at the polls does not mark a retreat away from free-market reforms and a reversion to the traditional, old-line communist system; economic reforms in Poland will not be derailed." <P>

The significance of the former communist leader's success only six years after the fall of communism is more symbolic than substantive.  Striking similarities existed in the political platforms of Kwasniewski and former Polish president and Solidarity leader Lech Walesa--both support market reform and privatization, as well as Poland's integration into the European Union and NATO.<P>

The growing political presence of former communists within Poland and Kwasniewski's victory has occurred for a number of reasons.  In the eyes of the Polish electorate, the younger generation of former communists have genuinely changed to Western European-style Social Democrats.  These "transformed" individuals have inherited a substantial political apparatus and monetary resources.<P>

Second, the political climate in Poland is anti-incumbent.  Bugajski argues that Poles may have grown tired of Walesa, who was seen as "unsophisticated and controversial."  By contrast, although Kwasniewski espouses the continuation of market reform, he is perceived as a more educated, competent, and  articulate leader; one who will present a better image of Poland abroad.<P>

At a meeting of the CSIS U.S.-Europe-Poland Action Commission in December 1994, Kwasniewski noted that his coalition was committed to the reform process and stressed the need for maintaining fiscal discipline and promoting higher levels of foreign investment.<P>

But perhaps the most significant reason the Left prevailed in the Polish presidential election stems from the deep divisions on the right of  the political spectrum.  With Kwasniewski capturing only 52% of the vote, there is a large constituency to be mobilized on the right-- something that Walesa has pledged to accomplish after leaving office.<P>

<I><B>Future Outlook :</B></I><BR>
Despite the dominance of former communists in the Polish government, the reforms continue.  Most recently, a large-scale privatization program, involving more than 400 major enterprises, was approved by the parliament.<P>

Bugajski points out that other former communist countries are continuing down the path of reforms.  In Hungary, for example, a coalition of liberals and socialists have implemented a major austerity package, cutting back on social security to meet IMF guidelines. <P>

A more important landmark than the presidential election in Poland's long road from a command to a market-based economy will be the Parliamentary ballot scheduled for 1997.  Bugajski concludes that "in the longer-term, the Socialist program will need to be monitored, particularly the passage of future budgets and any inclination to increase spending for social services that may result in a higher public deficit.<P>

<h1>India: Slowly but Surely</h1>

<h3>The CSIS International Financial Contingencies Group looks at India's prospects. . . </h3>

In light of the changing political balance in the lead-up to general elections next spring, what is the outlook for continued economic and financial reform in India?  Members of the CSIS International Financial Contingencies Group (IFCG)--chaired by Bill Schreyer, chairman emeritus of Merrill Lynch and chairman of the CSIS Executive Committee--addressed this question last week.  Their verdict: Reform will go forward, although at a slower rate, and the prospects for continued growth are good.<P>

There is little doubt about how far India has come since 1991, when it came dangerously close to a payments crisis.  The Narasimha Rao government has since embarked on a number of important reforms, including reworking the taxation system, privatizing minority shares of state-owned enterprises, reducing import duties, liberalizing key sectors such as tele-communications, lifting foreign exchange controls, and licensing private banks.  Still, much more needs to be done:<P>

 <LI><I>State Enterprise Reform</I>:  The government has sold minority positions in state enterprises, but eventually it will also have to divest itself of its majority position to advance the privatization process and reduce nagging public deficits.<P>

<LI><I>Insurance Sector</I>:  The government is reviewing a proposal to end the state monopoly in the  industry.  There may be incremental progress in some areas--such as licensing--in the near term, but no big changes will come until after the elections.<P>

 <LI><I>Labor Laws</I>:  Strict limitations on the right of employers to fire employees--in both public and private enterprises--constrain the drive for increased efficiency and higher levels of foreign investment.  The government has postponed action on proposed changes, but larger enterprises are downsizing. <P>

<LI><I>Banking Sector</I>:  For the first time in two decades, 10 privately held banks have been licensed.  But the government still holds a majority share in existing banks and a minority share in the new ones. Continued privatization of the banking sector is a precursor to more efficient mobilization of capital.<P>
<LI><I>Fiscal Management</I>:  Last month's budget increased subsidies to small farmers and the poor.  Although it reduced tariffs from 65% to 50%, the budget deficit was 6.7%.  This  may serve to reverse the current decline in inflation, which has dropped to 10.5%.
Progress in all these areas is clouded by an uncertain political outlook.  The ruling Congress (I) Party has suffered significant losses in recent state elections, including in investor-receptive Maharashtra and Gujarat, and there is now concern that the government will be less inclined to push the reform agenda.  Members of the IFCG noted, however, that the reforms enjoy  broad-based political support.  The current political volatility could slow--but will not stop--the reform process.  One IFCG member asserted that the election results reflect an antipolitician--rather than an antireform--mood in the country.
Rao should survive the current political damage and emerge as leader of yet another coalition government a year from now. <P>

On balance, look for India to pursue an incremental reform strategy until after the general elections.  In the meantime, India's strong economic fundamentals--including a high domestic savings rate, low inflation, and internally funded capital markets--will continue to make it a good target for "discriminating" international capital flows.  On the whole, the IFCG members are enthusiastic about India's short-term outlook and long-range potential.<P>

<h1>Gathering Speed</h1>

<h3>Argentina anticipates a rosy economic future . . </h3>

Look for economic growth in Argentina to recover somewhat this year to 2.5-3.0% and to rebound even more significantly next year.  That was the general conclusion of a distinguished group of Argentina-watchers who participated recently in the CSIS International Financial Contingencies Group (IFCG), chaired by CSIS Executive Committee Chairman and Merrill Lynch Chairman Emeritus Bill Schreyer.  But the capacity of the country to restore the high growth rates and economic dynamism of the early 1990s will depend on how well it handles unemployment, maintains fiscal discipline, restores consumer confidence, pursues labor reform, and sustains the economic reform process.  The rate of recovery will also depend on external linkages such as the policies of its main MERCOSUR partner, Brazil, and whether the U.S. Federal Reserve opts to raise interest rates to cool the U.S. economy.<P>

The economic turnaround in Argentina over the past seven years has been nothing short of profound.  Rapid economic reforms, among other things, obliterated hyperinflation and brought average growth of 7.75% during the 1991-94 period.  Then came the Mexican peso collapse and the tequila shock, which plunged Argentina into a growth contraction of 4.4% last year.  An unwelcome by-product of reform, high unemployment, made the contraction all the more difficult to tolerate.<P>

With congressional elections next year and the presidential election in 1999 looming, the operative question is whether the government can translate the current fragile recovery into sustained and more robust growth.  Variables identified by the group include:<P>

<I>Private consumption:</I> The re-entry of consumers into the Argentine economy is essential for any recovery.  Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo has attempted to encourage spending with a number of tax measures.  Nonetheless, consumption will increase only when consumers become confident that this period of stabilization will last.<P>

<I>Labor issues:</I>  Due to the massive layoffs incurred as newly privatized companies streamlined operations and a lingering recession, the unemployment rate stands at 17.4%.  However, productivity has risen in return, as evidenced by YPF, formerly a state-owned oil company now publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange.  It cut payrolls from 50,000 employees in 1990 to barely over 5,000 today.  In the same period, productivity increased 30%.<P>

<I>Trade:</I> Argentina's trade surplus hovers around $2 billion per year.  However, exports make up only 10% of its economy -- a figure that needs to grow to resolve Argentina's deficit.  Although the inclusion of Chile in MERCOSUR has obvious benefits, Brazil may be saturated with Argentine products  -- exports to Brazil increased 60% in 1995.  In response, Brazilian President Fernando Cardoso has offered a $2 billion incentive program to increase his country's exports.  On the positive side, corn and wheat prices are at a 15-year high (and expected to remain so), and industrial production increased 5% from May 1995 to May 1996.<P>

<I>Tax reform:</I> The recent drop in tax revenues have been primarily attributed to persistent tax evasion.  YoY tax receipts fell 3.2%, and an estimated 40% of the populace failed to pay social security taxes.  Improved tax collection is important if Argentina wants to effectively reduce its budget.<P>

<I>Politics:</I> The political situation looks good.  Many of the disputes between President Carlos Menem and Cavallo have been settled.  Furthermore, Cavallo's reforms, particularly the Convertibility Plan, are no longer under threat of dismantling.  Finally, both the ruling Peronists and the Radicals have come to espouse very similar political platforms, offering a political consistency unheard of for years in Argentina. <P>

With a normalized political environment, and assuming a stable international economy, Argentina should be poised for economic renewal within a few years.  In 1997, according to IFCG participants, the economy is anticipated to expand 5-6% as consumption and liquidity increase. <P>

<h3><a name="capmarkets">Capital Markets Regulatory Reform Project</a></h3>
Fundamental forces are transforming global financial markets and, in the process, are calling into question the ability of existing regulatory systems to cope with the rapid pace of change. This project brings together key government officials, industry leaders, economists, and legal experts to examine the regulation of capital markets in the United States and abroad, with a view to recommending appropriate changes to existing laws and regulations in light of the dramatic changes occurring in financial markets worldwide. Project principals have worked closely with Congress and regulatory agencies in support of modernization of U.S. financial services laws. In addition, the project focuses on the development of necessary capital markets infrastructure in emerging markets. <p>

<h3><a name="finpolicy">Global Financial Policy Forum Series</a></h3>
Under the auspices of the Capital Markets Regulatory Reform Project and in conjunction with other CSIS programs, CSIS sponsors major policy conferences and off-the-record roundtable discussions on critical international finance issues, including the impact of technology on financial markets and the development of international accounting standards. <p>

<h3><a name="giic">Global Information Infrastructure Commission</a></h3>
The GIIC was officially inaugurated in July 1995 at a 
meeting hosted by the World Bank. Its mission is to foster private sector leadership and private-public sector cooperation in the development of information networks and services to advance global economic growth, education, and quality of life. The Commission was established to respond to the recognition that traditional institutions and regulatory frameworks can no longer meet the increasingly complex challenges and opportunities of globalized information. The GIIC brings together 47 commissioners (mostly CEOs of major international corporations and World Bank and government representatives) from more than 20 developed and developing countries. The commission cochairs are Les Alberthal (chairman and CEO of EDS), Volker Guy (executive vice president of Siemens), and Minoru Makihara (president of Mitsubishi). <p>

<h3><a name="goc">Global Organized Crime</a></h3>
Organized crime has deeply penetrated the international economic and financial systems, and disparate criminal elements are integrating global operations in a way that strains national and international law enforcement and intelligence capabilities. Traditional prerogatives of national sovereignty not only are being challenged in cyberspace; they have largely ceased to exist. CSIS has responded to this threat by launching a major project that includes individual task forces on defensive information warfare (information technology security), terrorism, the nuclear black market, financial crimes, the narcotics industry, Russian organized crime, and Asian organized crime. The project recently published an extensive report entitled The Nuclear Black Market, which spawned an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act. The project is chaired by Judge William Webster, directed by CSIS Senior Adviser <a href="http://www.csis.org/html/4deborch.html">Arnaud de Borchgrave</a>, and codirected by CSIS Senior Adviser <a href="http://www.csis.org/html/4kupperm.html">Robert H. Kupperman</a> and CSIS Director of Studies <a href="http://www.csis.org/html/4peterso.html">Erik R. Peterson</a>. <p>

<h3><a name="2002">Global Trends 2002</a></h3>
Designed to offer useful near-term insights to decision-makers in business and government, the project brings together CSIS experts to examine major world trends over the next decade and their implications for a number of key countries. Global Trends 2002 differs from Seven Revolutions (see page 19) in three primary ways: its shorter time frame, its more in-depth research and analysis, and its use of specific contingency analyses and country projections. <p>

<h3><a name="ecommerce">Globalization of Electronic Commerce</a></h3>
"Electronic commerce" is becoming the dominant driver, not just a passenger, on the information highway. Given the ad-hoc, nonhierarchical structure of the Internet, new forms and extensions of commercial activity have evolved largely outside the traditional rules of trade, commerce, and sovereignty. Privacy, ownership, rights, tariffing, and access are just a few of the issues that take on new meaning in electronically generated or facilitated commerce. This project builds on the principles adopted in the Beijing Declaration and Call for Action Statement on "Advancing Globalized Electronic Commerce," (developed under the joint auspices of the GIIC, CIIED, the People's Bank of China, and the Ministry of Electronics Industry in the spring of 1996). They are: 1) increased private-sector leadership in cooperation with governments; 2) expanded access to the tools of electronic commerce for developing countries; 3) broad commitment to appropriate legal and regulatory frameworks; and 4) rapid transformation of banking and currency management systems.<p>

<h3><a name="infowar">Information-Based Warfare</a></h3>
As we approach the twenty-first century, the battlefield seems to be redefining itself. The coming "Information Age" will create new opportunities as well as new vulnerabilities that will have to be addressed by a re-engineered military. Although the use of information in warfare is not new, the advent of digitalization has greatly advanced its application on the battlefield. This study focuses on the future of Information-Based Warfare in the new, technology-intensive era. Through an electronic outreach program, Information Warfare forums, and an Information Warfare working group, the objective is to bring together key players in the academic, corporate, government, and military worlds to begin the critical task of framing policy for the future. <p>

<h3><a name="iiq">Information Intelligence Quotient - The IIQ©</a></h3>
Electronic communication now reaches far beyond traditional networks, customers, and content providers. Current definitions and measurements of infrastructure, access, and use are inadequate and increasingly misleading in this rapidly changing environment. The Information Intelligence Quotient, or IIQ© is envisioned to replace outdated definitions and measurements of communication infrastructure development and use and to support more effective planning and policy development. This project will develop a framework for a flexible, comparative measurement that will support analysis, planning, cooperation, and decision-making. The IIQ© will be designed as a strategic tool for both governments and industry to measure and benchmark policies and technology options in three areas: (1) infrastructure, (2) access, and (3) use.<p>

<h3><a name="nukes">Nuclear Weapons in a Transformed World</a></h3>
This study will examine the future of nuclear weapons in world politics. It consists of a detailed examination of a dramatic arms control proposal that has found increasing favor with analysts in the fieldóvirtual or dismantled nuclear arsenals. Through an edited volume and a program of international seminars, the study will examine whether virtual arsenals offer a realistic goal for the next century. <p>

<h3><a name="cyberspace">Restructuring for Cyberspace: Moving Countries from Theory to Reality</a></h3>
Over 50 countries are currently developing or implementing massive reform of their telecom laws and regulations to attract investment, infrastructure development, and service offerings. Companies and countries are also restructuring to respond to, or to co-opt, the new dynamics of multimedia market potential, on the one hand, and the still-remaining basic telephone network requirements on the other. This project facilitates direct dialogue and cooperative analysis among private and public sector decision-makers, promotes responsive policy options and "models that work," assesses "real world" impacts of telecom and broadcast restructuring in targeted countries, and enhances strategic planning capabilities of both government and industry. <p>

<h3><a name="7revs">"Seven Revolutions" Project</a></h3>
In 1993, CSIS launched the "Seven Revolutions" initiative, a project to identify and analyze the issues that leaders will face in the year 2020. The project assesses trends in seven areas of revolutionary change: demography, environment, technology, knowledge, finance and economics, conflict, and politics and society. Trends in the Seven Revolutions, analysis of interlinkages among those revolutions, and the Center's contingency thinking have been woven together into a presentation that has been shown across the country. <p>

<h3><a name="statesmen">Statesmen's Forum</a></h3>
This ongoing address series is designed to provide heads of state and other high-level political leaders with a forum for presenting their views about critical policy issues to other members of the policy community. Audience participants include U.S. government executive and legislative branch officials, foreign diplomats, academic and regional experts, leaders from the corporate community, and the media. These events allow those who have professional responsibility for interpretation of the issues and policy determination an opportunity to assess the positions and perspectives of government leaders and to engage in dialogue following the address. The substantive focus is generally on political, economic, and security policy issues, and current international affairs. <p>

<h3><a name="globalstrat">U.S. Global Strategy Group</a></h3>
Under the chairmanship of CSIS Counselor and former national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski, Senator Richard Lugar (R-IN), and Representative Lee Hamilton (D-IN), CSIS completed an ambitious project entitled "Foreign Policy into the Twenty-first Century: The U.S. Leadership Challenge." In the absence of a comprehensive foreign policy agenda for the post-cold war era, CSIS assembled a high-level group of 50 top government and private sector experts to determine what kind of world the United States should be moving toward and to suggest how it should go about doing so. In the process, they defined and prioritized U.S. national interests and formulated policy recommendations in seven geographical and functional areas: Asia, Europe, the Middle East, Russia and the Newly Independent States, international security, international economics, and global problems and opportunities. The project is now in its outreach phase with distribution of the final report to the foreign policy community, including the presidential candidates, members of Congress and executive branch officials. <p>

This work proposes the reorganization of America's ground forces on the strategic, operational, and tactical levels.  Central to the proposal is the simple thesis that the U.S. Army must take control of its future by exploiting the emerging revolution in 
military affairs.  The analysis argues that a new army warfighting organization will not only be more deployable and effective in joint operations; reorganized information age ground forces will be significantly less expensive to operate, maintain, and mo
dernize than the army's current Cold War division-based organization.  And while ground forces must be equipped with the newest weapons, new technology will not fulfill its promise of shaping the battlefield to American advantage if new devices are merely
 grafted onto old organizations that are not specifically designed to exploit them.<p>

<i>About the Book</i><p>

The process of economic integration in North America involves more political cooperation than ever before.  The distinction between domestic and international policy is becoming increasingly blurred.  This study approaches this process from a national vie
wpoint rather than focusing on narrowly defined themes.  Two authors from each North American country examine their country's "hang-ups" regarding sovereignty, one from an economic perspective and the other from a political one. <p>

<li><b><a name="bosnia">Bosnia: Building Democracy in a Divided Society.</a></b>  Bosnia-Hercegovina faces a long uphill struggle for democracy and civil rights.  The democratic and multiethnic option has been significantly weakened in both halves of the 

country following the September general elections.  The ballot not only legitimized the ruling nationalists but helped to consolidate ethnic division.  This was the prognosis of democratic activistsópoliticians, journalists, civic group organizers, educat

ors, and women's leadersófrom both Bosnian entities assembled by CSIS at a major forum in Sarajevo.  Participants concluded that lack of unity, agenda, and direction among opposition leaders contributed to the victory of ethno-nationalists.  The stark rea

lity is that "pluralism" in Bosnia remains a facade preserved for the benefit of the international community, which has failed to implement the civilian provisions of the Dayton accords.<p>

	Despite the pessimism, participants at the forum reached a number of concrete conclusions on how to proceed in the post-election period.  It is important for democratic parties and civic organizations to expand cooperation within and between the two enti

ties.  Without such a concerted effort, democrats will remain divided and marginalized.  Mergers between similar parties will also be necessary; otherwise, many will vanish by the next general elections.  The creation of an anti-nationalist civic bloc is 

also imperative to encompass a broad spectrum of parties, civic organizations, and local initiatives.  And, of course, a stronger network of alternative mass media, spanning the entire country, is essential to develop communication, dialogue, and civic ed

ucation across the ethnic divide.  In this process, the international community must play a more prominent and tangible role; otherwise, the premise of the Dayton accordsóthe restoration of a single multiethnic stateóremains a dead letter.  <i>(East Europ

ean Studies)</i><p>


  <li><b><a name="carib">Caribbean: Leadership into the 21st Century.</a></b>  Guiding the Caribbean into the next century will require greater understanding among the various sectors of each country's societyóprivate and public sectors, nongovernmental o

rganizations, community leaders, academiaóas well as among the different countries of the region, according to the CSIS Caribbean Leadership Group.  The group, composed of young, emerging leaders from the Caribbean, agreed that the next generation of lead

ers must do a better job of (1) articulating the difficult steps the region must take  to remain economically competitive in a global marketplace and retain its strong democratic traditions, and (2) identifying the long-term benefits of such a strategy.  

Over the next 12 months, participants will examine various issues, including:<p>

     <ul><li>the need to balance the benefits of greater economic and political cooperation with the inevitable loss of some sovereignty;
 	<li>the obstacles to forging a common Caribbean ideology and identity; and,
 	<li>the necessity of defending democracy against the influence and corruption of narcotics trafficking.</ul><p>

	Of particular concern to many of the participants was rising apathy among youth and the lack of economic opportunities, which may result in either a "brain drain"óthe emigration of a majority of the most-able populationóor the increased attractiveness of

 drug trafficking. When polled, 65 percent of young people in the English-speaking Caribbean did not believe their lot would improve significantly over the next five years.<p>

	Finally, the leaders questioned how the sometimes crisis-driven U.S.-Caribbean relationship might evolve.  Many envision, and fear, the potential for a competitive community of nations in the Caribbean.  This remains a key challenge for small, open, demo

cratic societies.  As one of the participants stated, "Having a vision of the future is essential, but having one alone is not enough." <i>(Americas Program)</i><p>


 <li><b><a name="china">China: Progress in Telecommunications Reforms.</a></b>   At a CSIS conference in Beijing, Reed Hundt, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), applauded China's efforts in telecommunications services and stressed th

e need for competition and choice in the market.  Addressing an audience of key policymakers from diverse agencies and ministries involved in China's informatization, Hundt outlined U.S. regulatory processes and goals.  He emphasized the United States' su

ccess with competition, which has resulted in better and lower-priced services for consumers.  "If we are to harness the enormous potential of the information age . . . we must be guided first and foremost by two principles: open markets and choice." <i>(

<a href="http://www.csis.org/html/ics/">International Communications Studies
Program</a>, CSIS's Center for Information Infrastructure and Economic Development, Beijing)</i><p>


  	<li><b><a name="europe">Europe: Ambassadors Discuss Baltic States' Membership in NATO.</a></b>  The Baltic countries are committed to becoming full members of NATO and share a common perspective on this issue, stated the Estonian, Latvian, and Lithuani

an Ambassadors at a recent CSIS forum.  In a joint speech at CSIS, the ambassadors argued that all applicant countries should be allowed to join NATO and that the accession of some states should not block that of others.  Furthermore, they hold that the B

altics are as well prepared for NATO membership as are the Central European states, which are widely speculated to be the first new members.  Other Western institutions such as the European Union, the West European Union, and the Organization for Security

 and Cooperation in Europe are not viable substitutes for NATO.<p>

	Inclusion of the Baltic countries in NATO raises the problem of a Russian reaction.  NATO would like to expand slowly because there is hope for a new relationship with Russia.  The Baltic countries, however, do not share this optimism.  They believe that

 their bid for membership is not provocative but rather preventive; it will act as a deterrent to Russian intervention in the Baltics.  As long as there is an unstable Russia, they argue, the Baltics will be at risk.  While NATO is proceeding with caution

, then, the Baltic countries remain worried that a first round of enlargement that excludes them will render the region perilously volatile.  <i>(European Studies Program)</i><p>


  <li><b><a name="ias">International Accounting Standards.</a></b>  As the pace of cross-border securities activity has quickened in recent years, the issue of disparate regulatory standards has taken on heightened importance. While market participants an

d regulatory authorities generally concur that the development of acceptable international standards would facilitate the continued growth of truly global financial markets, progress in reaching standards has been slow.  A number of critical issues remain

 unresolved. <p>

	During a roundtable session at CSIS, participants discussed the status of the International Accounting Standard Commission's (IASC) project to develop a core set of internationally acceptable standards and qualitative and quantitative comparisons between

 U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and non-U.S. standards.  They also debated whether U.S. listing standards should be modified to accommodate foreign issuers who do not reconcile with U.S. GAAP.  The Securities and Exchange Commission 

(SEC), although supportive of the IASC's undertaking to develop an acceptable set of international standards, believes that U.S. GAAP provide more useful information and greater transparency than other existing standards do.  The Commission emphasized the

 essential role of high-quality accounting standards in preserving both investor protection and the preeminent global position of U.S. capital markets.  Foreign issuers, on the other hand, expressed the view that U.S. GAAP are unduly detailed and overly c

omplicated.  In addition, other participants argued that there is a lack of empirical data to support the argument that U.S. standards are superior to international standards.  (<i>Capital Markets Regulatory Reform Project)</i><p>


  <li><b><a name="iran">Iran: U.S. Policy Questioned.</a></b>  The U.S. government must reassess its current policy toward Iran.  Containment solves nothing; instead, it intensifies the friction and worsens relations between the two countries.  This was t

he message delivered by several speakers during a CSIS conference on Central Asia.  Although it is in the U.S. national interest to assist the nations of Central Asia in achieving growth and political stability, the current U.S. policy toward Iran may ins

tead help throw those nations back into the not-so-tender arms of Russia.  <i>(Energy and National Security Program)</i><p>


<li><b><a name="mexico">Mexican Political Stability: To Be or Not To Be?</a></b> The economic policy that Mexico has followed for the last decade has failed to meet the needs of the average Mexican. Economic liberalization alone has not, and will not, sol

ve Mexico's social problems, asserted a group of U.S. and Mexican specialists during a discussion at CSIS on Mexico's political stability.  The uneven distribution of the benefits reaped from economic liberalization, coupled with the adverse effects of th

e 1994 peso crisis, has led to frustration and heightened social tensions.  Media reports disclosing flagrant abuses of public office and illicit self-enrichment have further exacerbated the problem. The analysts agreed that these escalating tensions come

 at a time when Mexico is navigating through what could be a defining moment in its political historyóa political opening that, if realized, could end the ruling party's 67-year reign.<p>

	Doubts about the ability of Mexico's political party system to represent the interests of the average Mexican have prompted some Mexicans in marginalized parts of the country to consider guerrilla movements as alternative channels of political expression

.  Although some of the analysts suspect that the guerrilla movements have been used in part by anti-reform factions interested in altering the balance of power, they do not dismiss the possibility that such activity could also be symptomatic of a more pr

ofound change in Mexico's traditional political apathy.  Those who have a stake in Mexico's political future must not lose sight of the great strides that the country has taken toward economic and political transparency.  Mexico's rapid decentralization i

s likely to cause particular pendulum swings in the future, which are typical of any confederation.  The upcoming mid-term elections in July 1997 will serve as a bellwether of Mexico's political evolution.  <i>(Mexico Project)</i><p>


<li><b><a name="mexico2">Mexico: Mexico and U.S. Immigration Policy.</a></b>  More fences and expanded border patrols are unlikely to alter the number of Mexicans who illegally cross the border, except perhaps at isolated venues.  Experts at a CSIS confer

ence on U.S.-Mexican immigration issues concluded that stronger sanctions against employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants would be a more effective solution. The de facto migration policy of each country must also change to accommodate the new pol

itical and economic conditions in the bilateral relationship. To do this, a bilateral approach is needed under which each country is willing to make concessions acceptable to the other.  For example, the United States could foster more legal immigration f

rom Mexico; and Mexico, for its part, needs to recognize that the internal political and economic policies that lead to the emigration of its nationals will require modification.  <i>(William E. Simon Chair in Political Economy and University of Texas)</i

><p>


<li><b><a name="mideast">Middle East: Rebuilding Lebanon.</a></b>  Progress in the peace process would significantly bolster the political and economic reconstruction of Lebanon.  Prime Minister Rafiq B. Hariri of Lebanon, speaking at a recent CSIS States

men's Forum, asserted that parliamentary elections were successful and that economic recovery is proceedingóthe Lebanese pound is stable and inflation is under control.  Hariri stressed, however, that foreign investment in Lebanon was critical in the next

 stage.  The U.S. ban on travel to Lebanon has affected confidence and prevented American investors from taking advantage of profitable opportunities in Lebanon. Yet despite the ban, thousands of Americansómost Lebanese-Americanóare traveling to Lebanon e

very year.  The prime minister spoke to President Clinton about lifting the travel ban after the U.S. elections because, he claims, there are no security problems.<p>

	Hariri said that Syrian forces in Lebanon have helped the central government maintain security.  There can be no "Lebanon first" in the peace process because neither Syria nor Lebanon would abandon the other.  The withdrawal of Israel's defense forces fr

om southern Lebanon in accordance with UN Resolution 425 would be a meaningful initial step.  Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed militia in southern Lebanon, continues to resist Israeli occupation.  Although the prime minister has many political differences wi

th Hezbollah, he recognizes that foreign occupation always prompts citizen resistance.  <i>(Middle East Studies)</i><p>


 <li><b><a name="net">Middle East Net Assessment: U.S. Policy Revisited.</a></b>  The United States faces growing problems in sustaining its efforts to contain Iran and Iraq.  Although the United States has had considerable success in its efforts to conta

in the build-up of Iranian and Iraqi military forces, Arab, European, and Asian support for economic sanctions for Iraq is steadily diminishing, noted Tony Cordesman, codirector of CSIS Middle East Studies in recent testimony to the Senate Armed Services 

Committee.  Furthermore, there is minimal support for U.S. efforts to enforce economic sanctions on Iran. The United States has also failed to address the contradictions between the U.S. energy policy that calls for a major expansion in Iranian and Iraqi 

oil production and a containment policy that attempts to block investment in Iran's and Iraq's capability to expand and sustain their petroleum exports. <p>

	The United States needs both a near-term and a much clearer, long-term strategy for maintaining its power projection capabilities in the Gulf.  In the short run, Cordesman believes, the key to dealing with Iraqi and Iranian military capabilities will be 

a continued military alliance between the United States and the southern Gulf states.  No deal with Iraq is likely to last longer than the U.S. military presence in the Gulf or be any stronger than a combination of southern Gulf military forces and U.S. p

ower projection capabilities.  Diplomacy at best will be an extension of force by other means.  As is the case with Iran, the threat from Iraq can ultimately be contained or countered only by U.S. and allied war fighting capability.  <p>
	At the same time, the long-term strategy must address issues in other areas, including:<p>

   <ul><li>reconciling U.S. containment policy with U.S. energy policy;
 	<li>realizing that economic sanctions against Iraq are punishing the Iraqi people, not the leadership;
 	<li>devising a strategy for strengthening southern Gulf allies that looks far beyond arms sales and burden-sharing and focuses on political stability and military effectiveness;
 	<li>creating a strategy for dealing with local political and economic problems and the issue of Islamic fundamentalism; and
 	<li>developing a strong counterterrorism policy tailored to the threats in the Gulf and preparing for unconventional warfare.</ul><p>  <i>(Middle East Studies)</i><p>


<li><b><a name="nato">NATO:  Facing New Challenges.</a></b>  The process of adapting NATO to today's European security context is marked by three challenges.  First, NATO must define new roles and a new mission for itself and respond to crises such as Bos

nia.  Second, NATO must reform to accommodate a stronger European security and defense identity and to settle the issue of the Southern Command.  Third, NATO must look carefully at the issue of expansion.  This final challenge raises poignant questions th

at remain to be settled: How do we justify the claim that NATO enlargement increases security?  What to do with the countries that are not invited to join immediately, or not at all?  How to handle Russia?  These questions were addressed at a recent CSIS 

Eurowatch Group meeting.<p>

	Exactly which Central and Eastern European countries will be invited to join NATO remains an open question.  The United States is keen to keep the requirements for NATO membershipóa stable democratic system, a growing and stable economy, civilian control

 of the militaryóvery high, yet others criticize this approach as exclusive and divisive.  Enlargement is an open process, however, and membership in NATO should be used as an incentive to encourage potential members to conduct reforms that they otherwise

  <li><b><a name="oil">Persian Gulf Oil: No Alternative.</a></b>  Oil-importing nations have been searching for years for an acceptable alternative to Persian Gulf oilóthat is, supplies considered more secure and less subject to political manipulation.  F

ollowing the dissolution of the Soviet Union, foreign oil companies were invited to explore for and develop the rich oil potential of the Caspian Sea Basin.  The potential of this basin has caught the eye of virtually every major international oil company

.  Tens of billions of dollars are to be invested in the Caspian in production and pipeline infrastructure.  But has an alternative to Persian Gulf oil been found?  Unfortunately for those oil-importing nations, it has not, stated Bob Ebel, director of th

e CSIS Energy and National Security Program at a CSIS conference on Central Asia.  Consequently, the U.S. relationship with Persian Gulf producers will be just as important in the years ahead as it is today.  In fact, growing U.S. dependence on Persian Gu

lf oil seem inescapable.  <i>(Energy and National Security Program)</i><p>


 	<b><a name="russia">Russia and the West: A Relationship in Search of a Strategy.</a></b>  Russia and the West are fast approaching a critical moment that will significantly influence the course of their relations long into the future.  As Russia attempt

s to define its national interests following the collapse of the Soviet empire, the opportunities for the United States and its European allies to help integrate Russia politically and culturally into the West have never been greater.  At the same time, t

he West has an opportunity to enhance stability in Central Europe by extending NATO's security umbrella eastward.  The United States and its allies face a paradoxóeither they can go forward with NATO expansion and confront an alienated and possibly hostil

e Russia in the future, or they can restructure NATO into a political alliance lacking any substantial deterrent capability.  This second option would accommodate Russian concerns and prevent what could be a crisis in relations between Russia and the West

, but at the cost of undermining NATO's role as a central instrument of military stability in Europe.<p>

	Dr. Michael St&uuml;rmer, director of the research institute Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik in Germany, recently discussed at a CSIS briefing the choices faced by the West and the potential Russian response.  He noted that although Russia cannot stop 

NATO's acceptance of new members, it can turn NATO expansion into a high-risk gamble for the West in the long term.  Among its many options, Russia could (1) threaten the Baltic states by raising tensions over the treatment of ethnic Russians in the regio

n, (2) conduct large-scale military exercises along Russia's borders with Central Europe to frighten off potential investors from NATO's new former Communist members, or (3) call back credit extended to Ukraine to create an economic crisis there.  As NATO

 prepares to announce its intentions in the coming months, the West must anticipate Russia's reaction and be aware of the risks and dangers that lie ahead.  <i>(Russian and Eurasian Studies Program)</i><p>


 <li><b><a name="safrica">South Africa:  Will the South African Economy Live Up to Expectations?</a></b>  South Africa's political miracle must now be matched by an economic miracle, according to Dr. Conrad Strauss, chairman of South Africa's Standard Ban

k Investment Corporation.   Political and social uncertainty have created a wait-and-see stance among potential foreign investors.  Despite successful and democratic local elections throughout the country, a reduction in political violence, and the increa

sing accountability of its civil service, South Africa is still at a transitional stageóinstitution-building takes time.<p>

	Among the most tenacious and fundamental economic challenges facing South Africa are a flat and sticky growth rate of three percent, dwindling foreign exchange reserves, and a low gross domestic savings rate.  Designed to strike at the heart of the probl

em is the new "Growth, Employment, and Redistribution" program (GEAR) that targets budget and tax reform, job creation, worker training, and privatization.  The program does little, however, to create social action programs for the poor, a gap Deputy Pres

ident Thabo Mbeki is now trying to fill.  Strauss believes that GEAR will ultimately succeed, thanks to an emerging partnership between government and the private sector and the commitment of both to create conditions necessary for growth.  <i>(African St

udies Program)</i><p>


 <li><b><a name="sweden">Sweden: Telecom Minister Hails Swedish Liberalization and Outlines Future Plans.</a></b>  The Swedish telecom market is one of the most open in Europe.  With the upcoming revision of the 1993 Telecom Act, Sweden promises to lead E

urope in liberalization, stated Swedish Minister for Transport and Communications Ines Uusmann during a CSIS conference.  "The experience of the liberalization of the Swedish telecom market shows that a lower level of regulation is preferable to a higher 

one. As a result of the liberalization, the Swedish market is very dynamic."  <p>

	The Swedish Telecom Ministry is now working with dominant carrier Telia and the telecom regulatory authority on the planned July 1, 1997 revision of the current telecom law. This revision is necessary for two reasons: (1) failure of the original legislat

ion to address contentious issues such as interconnection, and (2) new EU regulations and directives aimed at European telecom harmonization.  <i>(International Communications Studies Program)</i><p>


 <li><b><a name="tanzania">Tanzania:  A Conversation with President Benjamin Mkapa.</a></b>  Tanzania continues its struggle to move beyond its one-party socialist legacy and strengthen its democratic institutions.  Economic reforms are bringing about deb

t relief, increased foreign investment, and privatization.  At its peak, Tanzania had 400 state-owned enterprises; today many of these enterprises have been privatized, and the government is actively trying to sell others at a reasonable price.  Identifyi

ng himself as a representative of this new style of leadership in Africa, President Benjamin Mkapa described these ongoing positive reforms during a CSIS briefing.<p>

	New African leaders are committed to establishing more market-oriented economies and promoting sustainable development.  Mkapa emphasized that African nations do not need endless aid, but rather logistic and technical support that will facilitate self-re

liance and development.  Successful reform can be initiated only by the African people; however, international support for debt relief, privatization, and foreign direct investment is still necessary.  As an influential global leader, the United States mu

st continue to push the political and economic reform process.  <i>(African Studies Program)</i><p>


 <li><b><a name="turkey">Turkey: Political and Economic Difficulties.</a> </b> The two wings of the current coalition government, the Islamist Welfare Party and the secular, center-right True Path Party, have continued to pull in different directions, eve

n as their joint interest in staying in power has led them to downplay their differences in order to maintain the partnership.  Visiting speakers at CSIS focused on the basic contradictions in the government and pointed out the dangers for Turkey's future

.<p>

	Although Halis Komili, president of the Turkish Industrialists and Businessmen's Association (TUSIAD), underlined the need for an enhanced role for his organization and the entire Turkish private sector in the effort to find a solution to the problems af

flicting Turkey, he was not optimistic that the worsening economic situation or other Turkish woes could be solved in the near future. Emre Gonensay, the former foreign minister who resigned from the True Path Party because of his opposition to the curren

t coalition, spoke about the need for structural reforms in the Turkish economy and political institutions and called for an end to the potentially dangerous drift away from the West.  He pointed to the related delay of the Turkish effort to build support

 for a Baku-Ceyhan pipeline.  <i>(Turkish Studies)</i><p>


 <li><b><a name="turkey2">Turkey: Unwilling to Undertake Austerity Measures.</a></b>  Turkey's proposed 1997 budget is unrealistic and fails to tackle the root causes of Turkey's economic problems, concludes the latest issue of CSIS's Turkey Update.  The 

Welfare Party, with its populist policies designed to maximize its chances of coming to power alone in early general elections, is unwilling to alienate its core supporters at the bottom of the economic scale by tightening the Turkish economic belt. With 

the IMF talks on this issue stalled, Turkey is moving toward a credit crunch and further financial and political convulsions. <i>(Turkish Studies)</i><p>


 <li><b><a name="ukraine">Ukraine: Progress on Many Fronts.</a></b>  Ukraine has clearly made progress in its transition to a marketplace democracy, as evidenced by recent signs of economic stabilization in the country and the adoption of a new constituti

on.  In addition, the recent formation of the Al Gore-Leonid Kuchma Commission, a milestone in the development of Ukrainian-American relations, demonstrates that the strategic partnership between America and Ukraine is becoming a reality.  <p>

	During the CSIS American-Ukrainian Advisory Committee (AUAC) meeting in Kiev, committee members recommended that both governments begin the task of prioritizing and defining more clearly the concrete political, security, and economic content of the new U

krainian-American strategic partnership.  To assist this effort, the following chief recommendations were made:<p>

 <ul><li>If Russia is invited to next year's NATO summit, Ukraine should be invited as well;
 <li>	Cooperation between Ukraine and NATO should be upgraded.  The Ukrainian government should take a number of specific steps to that end;
 <li>	Both countries should express concern over the ongoing political developments in Belarus;
 <li>	Economic reforms in Ukraine should be intensified and accelerated in a number of specific ways;
 <li>	The United States and the European Union (EU) should work to enhance Ukraine's relations with the EU;
 <li>	The United States should henceforth refer to Ukraine in its official statements not as a NIS but as a Central European state; and,
 <li>	Contact with and between U.S. members of Congress and Ukrainian parliamentarians should be intensified.</ul><p>

 <li><b><a name="us">United States: Defense Restructuring for the 21st Century.</a></b>  The Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) has the potential to fundamentally shake up the U.S. defense structure and defense policy.  At the first CSIS Military Strategy F

orum on QDR, Dr. Edward Warner, assistant secretary of defense for strategy and requirements, discussed the Defense Department's ambitious undertaking that will produce a blueprint for U.S. defense posture into the next century.  The QDR will examine five

 basic elementsóthe strategic environment in the near future, the U.S. force structure, modernization, readiness, and the defense infrastructure.  Although the review is mandated by law, its timing is very appropriate because of the changes the defense co

mmunity is confronting.  <p>

	In the face of large cutbacks in funding and manpower, the Department of Defense is attempting to craft a leaner, more effective military that will be able to meet the uncertain challenges of the post-Cold War era.  Rapid advances in technology are also 

presenting policymakers with a host of new weapons systems, from nonlethal weapons to the Joint Strike Fighter, that are competing for limited resources.  The review will be formally launched this December with the final report due in May, after which it 

is passed over to the National Defense Panel (NDP) for a critique.  In addition to critiquing the QDR, the NDP has been tasked by Congress to conduct a separate study called the Alternative Force Structure Assessment (AFSA), which will be presented to Con

gress in December 1997.  <i>(Political-Military Studies)</i><p>

<h3><a name="near">Energy Choices in the Near Abroad: The Haves and

<a href="http://www.csis.org/html/4ebel.html">Robert E. Ebel</a><p>
Of  the 14 republics that make up the "Near Abroad," only three_Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Azerbaijan_are rich in oil and natural gas. The others have been almost completely dependent on Russia for their fuel. Russia, with its own energy sector in difficulty, has been cutting back deliveries. The republics with substantial oil and gas resources are challenged to develop them in a timely and responsible fashion. Success will move them into the world of developed nations; failure will bring economic stagnation and political grief. <p>

Fifteen nuclear reactors of the type that exploded at Chernobyl in April 1986 are still operating in Russia, Ukraine, and Lithuania.  The West, concerned about safety of operations, wants these reactors shut down, but the host nations refuse. The electricity these reactors supply is much too important for their economies, so the argument goes. The report defines policy options and procedures to implement those options for the acceptable resolution of the nuclear power safety issues facing the former Soviet Union.<p>

<b>FACT:</b>	<blockquote>We are growing older. In 1950, only 7.9% of the population was over 65.  By 2010, that number will grow to 19.4%. </blockquote> 

<b>FACT:</b>	<blockquote>We are living longer.  When Social Security was enacted in 1935, the life expectancy of Americans was under 65 years of age.  Today, it is over 75 years of age, which means that benefits are paid out for more years.</blockquote>

<b>FACT:</b>	<blockquote>Current levels of spending on entitlement programs are not sustainable.  Under current law, by 2015, spending on entitlement programs and net interest on the debt will absorb all federal revenues.  By 2070, the unfunded liability of Social Security and Medicare will be over $20 trillion.</blockquote>

<b>FACT:</b>	<blockquote>Fifty years ago, over 40 workers paid in to Social Security for every beneficiary.  In 14 years, when Baby Boomers begin to retire, there will be fewer than three workers per beneficiary.</blockquote>

<b>FACT:</b>	<blockquote>Fewer future workers will be contributing to sustain these federal entitlement programs.  The birth rate has declined from the Baby Boomer peak average of over 3.6 to just over 2 births.</blockquote>

<b>FACT:</b>	<blockquote>Social Security is a "pay as you go" system, in which current payroll taxes fund current benefits.  With the retirement of the Baby Boom generation, the benefits will begin to exceed revenues by 2012.</blockquote>

<b>FACT:</b>	<blockquote>Only half of American workers are covered by a pension plan.  Last year alone, there was a $64 billion unfunded liability, or shortfall in these funds.  In 1979, "defined-benefit" plans made up 90% of all employer pension programs.  By 1990, this dropped to just over 60%.  This shift to "defined-contribution" plans [e.g. 401(k)'s] has created an investment education gap.</blockquote>

<b>FACT:</b>	<blockquote>The American people are not saving like they used to.  The personal savings rate, over 11% in 1965, has decreased to under 3% in 1993.  Half of American families have below $1,000 in net financial savings.</blockquote>

<b>FACT:</b>	<blockquote>The National Commission on Retirement Policy is sponsored by CSIS, a public policy research institution dedicated to "policy impact."  This initiative will look at all aspects of the retirement financing crisis.  It has no pre-ordained outcome in mind.  The effort is broad and bipartisan ó headed by leading members of Congress and the private sector.  The goals are to analyze the various policy options, educate the public on the issues, and build a political consensus on what must be done, ending with the formation of new legislation.</blockquote>

<h3><a name="converse">"Conversations" with African Heads of State</a></h3>
 The African Studies Program hosts conversation-style meetings with visiting heads of state and other senior government officials. Recent sessions have included President Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania, JosÈ Eduardo dos Santos of Angola, President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia, President Frederick Chiluba of Zambia, President Jerry Rawlings of Ghana, and Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo of Zaire. <p>

<h3><a name="finance">CSIS Working Group on Finance in Africa</a> </h3>
African economies emerging from the rigors of structural adjustment and economic policy reform are vibrant with new opportunities in key financial sectors, but taking advantage of them requires knowledge as well as an adventurous spirit. To help interested companies become familiar with this world, the African Studies Program has launched a new study group exploring targeted markets, the transition to open economies, the regionalization of the African marketplace, the mechanics of banking/stock markets/exchange rates and the financial products needed to support growth. Featuring key African actors and their business partners from other parts of the world, this group plots the transition from donor-based to private economies and helps its members take advantage of the numerous opportunities for profit in this capital-scarce environment. <p>

<h3><a name="angola">CSIS Angola Study Group</a></h3>
 Cochaired by Senator Nancy L. Kassebaum (R-KS), Chester Crocker, Landegger Distinguished Research Professor at the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service, and Maurice Tempelsman, this forum has continued to meet frequently since it was organized in February 1991. The roster of guest speakers at the periodic half-day sessions includes key Angolan leaders from across the political spectrum; senior UN, Portuguese, and U.S. officials; corporate analysts; and academic specialists.<p>

<h3><a name="nigeria">CSIS Nigeria Working Group</a></h3>
 Cochaired by President Richard Matzke of Chevron Overseas Petroleum, Pauline Baker, president of the Fund for Peace, and Representative Cynthia McKinney (D-GA), the Nigeria roundtable, organized in 1993, examines a broad range of assessments from various key actors and analysts of the prospects for political stability and responsible governance in sub-Saharan Africa's most populous country. Plans are underway to expand activities in October 1996 to search for solutions to the current Nigerian dilemma. <p>

<h3><a name="south">CSIS Working Group on South and Southern Africa</a></h3>
 This roundtable forum meets frequently with distinguished guest speakers representative of a broad spectrum of perspectives to assess local, regional, and intercontinental implications (political, economic, and social) of the post-apartheid transition in South Africa.  Cochairs are Ambassador Donald McHenry of Georgetown University, Wayne Fredericks of the Carnegie Corporation, and Daniel O'Flaherty, vice president of the National Foreign Trade Council and executive director of the U.S.-South Africa Business Council. <p>

<h3><a name="discuss">Discussions on African Regional and Functional Topics</a></h3>
 The program convenes audiences to participate in discussion on a wide range of African issues and countries. In 1996 a series of sessions on Africa's Great Lakes Region was launched; the roster included U.S. ambassadors to Uganda and Zaire, Rwandan Vice President Paul Kagame, Ugandan Defense Minister Amama Mbabazi, and U.S. Special Envoy to Burundi Peace Negotiations Howard Wolpe. A series of events examining the countries of the CFA zone has also been inaugurated.  <p>

<h4>Number 13,

January 30, 1996</h4>
<hr>
<h1>Not So Fast</h1>

<h3>Don't expect another stampede into emerging markets in 1996</h3>

Will there be a resurgence in international portfolio investment to the emerging markets this year?  Members of the CSIS International Financial Contingencies Group (IFCG), chaired by Bill Schreyer, chairman emeritus of Merrill Lynch, addressed this issue yesterday.  Their conclusion: A restoration of portfolio flows is in the cards, but not at the record level of 1993.  After the "reality check" that the December 1994 collapse in Mexico inflicted on them, international investors will be much more discriminating.<P>

The circumstances for increased capital flows to the emerging markets appear to be favorable.  Interest rates are down in the industrialized countries.  Global capital liquidity, according to industry reports, is the highest it has been for three years.  Emerging markets are still showing faster growth rates than the highly industrialized countries, and many of their shares offer more attractive p/e-to-growth ratios.  That, coupled with the perception that U.S. markets may not be able to match last year's performance, suggests that foreign portfolio investment may rebound -- by one account to $50 billion, as compared with the peak of more than $60 billion in 1993.<P>

Asia continues to represent the most attractive investment target, particularly for capital investment, but the picture there is mixed.  Korea is embroiled in political crisis; allegations of political payoffs have now escalated into charges of treason.  In China, the heavy-handed policies enacted by the government to restrict business-oriented information have cast a shadow over the explosion of private sector activity.  India faces elections in April and is locked in political crisis over corruption issues.  By contrast, the outlook for the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand is encouraging.<P>

In Latin America, reform is holding up well.  The Mexican government is persevering politically with its austerity program, and today's $1.3 billion initial repayment of the U.S.-led assistance package is a positive sign.  Argentina has also registered significant
 progress in restoring fiscal discipline and investor confidence. Brazil and Peru are both experiencing high growth rates, though the string of elections over the next three years suggests potential obstacles.  The Chilean market is solid, though there is some concern about the possibility of falling world copper prices.<P>

South African financial markets surged at the end of last year, and if the last remaining currency controls are lifted, it will reinforce the recent trend of large foreign capital inflows.<P>

In the face of this menu of investment options, investors are likely to discriminate on the basis of several clear criteria.  First, they will look at market size.  Many of the emerging markets are thin, and those low levels of capitalization will serve as a disincentive.  Investors will not want to get caught again in small markets in which their liquidity is reduced.  Second, they will look for good economic fundamentals.  Investors will need clear evidence that they are solidly on the reform track and positioned to "earn" the foreign investment they receive with good performance.  Third, in the wake of the Mexican meltdown, investors no longer believe that the emerging markets are not correlated among themselves and will tailor their diversification strategies accordingly.<P>

The bottom line: Investors rushed into the emerging markets in 1993 and rushed out after the poor returns of 1994 and the Mexico crisis.  Now they seem poised to return, albeit selectively.  As one participant argued, "the 1993 bubble has been pricked."  It now remains to be seen how quickly flows will resume.<P>

<UL><li><B><a name="casp">Caspian Sea:</a>  Dynamics of Caspian Energy Resources.</B>  The presence of oil fosters crises; it does not resolve them.  That was the central message that Bob Ebel, director of the CSIS Energy and National Security Program, carried to a recent international conference on "Post-Dayton Balkans in Europe." The Balkans will serve as transit countries for Caspian Basin oil moving to markets in Europe, and many of the nations are anxious for international pipelines to be built across their borders.  Not only would they earn substantial transit fees, but the availability of oil and the need for the supporting infrastructure also offer prospects of jobs and fuel for their economies.  In addition, oil pipelines have become highways of influence and points of leverage for the countries whose territory they traverse.  Ebel warned that pipelines are also attractive targets for dissident activity.  The presence of oil does not soothe political friction; rather, it does just the opposite.  <I>(Energy and National Security Program)</I><P>


 <LI><B><a name="euro1">Europe:</a>  Euro-Focus.</B>  Aspects of change in Europe and U.S.-European relations are addressed in the current issue of Euro-Focus.  After analyzing the implications of the anticipated Labor victory in next year's British elections, the first article concludes that a new Labor government will pursue some policies that are more supportive of European integration.  The second discusses Polish economic and political reforms that are aimed at preparing the country for membership in NATO and the European Union and asserts that the West must provide Poland with an unequivocal commitment for membership by a certain date.  The final article reviews European reactions to the Helms-Burton Act and D'Amato bill and argues that transatlantic trade is not seriously threatened despite the recent strain that these initiatives have brought to U.S.-EU trade relations. <I>(European Studies Program)</I><P>


  <LI><B><a name="euro2">Europe:</a>  Rationalizing and Coordinating the Sale of Conventional Armaments.</B>  Can the United States and Europe create a cooperative venture within the transatlantic alliance on conventional arms sales to the Central and East European Countries (CEECs)? According to participants in a CSIS working group, the major obstacle to transatlantic cooperation is the disparity in size between the American and European defense industries.  European industry needs to consolidate so that its arms manufacturers can deal with their American counterparts on an equal footing.  Although such a consolidation will not totally eliminate the size disparity, cooperation is nevertheless possible because the Europeans hold a political card: Because many CEECs want to join the European Union, Brussels will play a significant role in negotiating the terms of arms sales to these countries.<P>

	As the expansion of both NATO and the EU looms large on the political horizon, the key task is to develop a broad vision of U.S.-EU cooperation in the sale of arms to CEECs.  Such a vision must define a mix of government and private-sector participation to integrate CEECs into Western institutions.  At present, there is little consensus within the transatlantic alliance on a specific definition of this mix, with some favoring strong governmental leadership and others advocating market-led strategies.  Although agreement on an appropriate approach will be difficult to reach, the importance of the problem makes it imperative to hold open and constructive dialogues.  <I>(European Studies Program)</I><P>


  <LI>	<B><a name="france">France:</a>  Experts Review New Telecom Law.</B>  The new French telecommunications law should make it easier for American firms to compete in France's growing telecom market, according to a panel convened by the CSIS International Communications Studies Program.  The panel reviewed provisions of the law, passed by the French parliament in June, that mandate a more competitive telecommunications framework.  The law was in part a response to a European Union regulation setting a January 1998 deadline for extensive competition in regional telecommunications services, including voice telephony.  Damien Regnault of the French Embassy characterized the law as "a real liberalization" of French telecom.<P>

	Charles Tievsky of Teleglobe International indicated that there is some concern about delays in implementing the law's provisions.  He said that Teleglobe was particularly interested in the fact that there appears to be a big demand for closed-user services.  "We're ready to act," he added.  Mary Lee Allen of MFS International noted that her company was already offering telecom services in France and other European countries.  MFS International's reaction to the law is very positive, she said.  The company's French license is on an experimental basis, providing competitive fiber-optic services in Paris.  The company has filed applications for both domestic and international licenses.  <I>(<A HREF="http://www.csis.org/html/ics/">International Communications Studies Program</A>)</I><P>


   <LI><B><a name="korea">The Korean Peninsula:</a>  Change and Challenge.</B>  The structural flaws in the North Korean economy are so serious that only radical market reforms coupled with massive foreign assistance will save the country.  That was the conclusion reached by U.S. and South Korean policymakers and scholars who recently examined the situation in North Korea and discussed the regional security fallout from the instability in that country.  Observers were divided on the likelihood of a regime change.  Some suggested that the military might take control of the country in the next two to three years; others concluded that North Korea will somehow "muddle through" for the next five.  <P>

	Participants also discussed the process and potential impact of Korean reunification.  A Korean scholar argued that a unified Korea would act as a balancer in East Asia through multilateral security cooperation, dispelling fears of a unified Korea that may gravitate toward China and antagonize Japan.  In his examination of the missile threats from North Korea, a U.S. scholar explored the implications of a theater missile defense (TMD) system for South Korea and Japan and concluded that such a system could neutralize the North's missile threats.  <I>(Asian Studies Program in conjunction with the Research Institute for National Unification [RINU], Seoul)</I><P>


  <LI>	<B><a name="kwaz">KwaZulu-Natal:</a>  Is There Hope for ANC-Inkatha Reconciliation?</B>  After years of bitter and often violent rivalry between the African National Congress (ANC) and the Inkatha Freedom Party, party leaders realize that they share common goals and that trust and cooperation must be established between them if South Africa is to prosper.  That was the central message of a delegation from the parliament of South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province, representing both the ANC and the Inkatha, in their discussion at CSIS on the challenges of nation-building and the constitutional process in their country's nascent democracy.  While the parties disagree on key issues such as land reform and the role of traditional leaders in government, they foresee a new era of improved interparty relations and note that political violence in KwaZulu-Natal has steadily diminished in recent months.  Centralization of government power was a major theme of the delegation's discussion; Inkatha advocates a more decentralized government than does the ANC.  Nonetheless, Inkatha representatives pledged their support for South Africa's draft constitution and promised to abide by it despite their objections to some of its provisions.  Neither party predicts significant changes to the document before it goes into effect.  <I>(African Studies Program)</I> <P>

<LI> 	<B><a name="nafta">NAFTA and the U.S. Election:  A Trinational Assessment.</a></B>  The relative silence on NAFTA in this year's general election campaign stems from the agreement's success to date and proves that the arguments of NAFTA opponents were "over-hyped," concluded a panel of experts from the United States, Canada, and Mexico.  The panel, chaired by CSIS William E. Simon Chairholder Sidney Weintraub, agreed that the preliminary data were favorable:<P>

<UL>
<LI>U.S. trade increased with both Mexico and Canada, $56 billion and $132 billion respectively since NAFTA took effect.

<LI>Contrary to Ross Perot's predicted "giant sucking sound" of U.S. jobs disappearing, more than 260,000 new American jobs were created as a direct result of NAFTA during its first 30 months.

<LI>Now that the aftershocks of the Mexican peso crisis are over, Mexico is repaying its loans on time and, in fact, never drew on the full credit offered it by the U.S. Treasury.

<LI>Most critical, NAFTA has grown to become the crown jewel in America's strategy to promote free and equal trade both in this hemisphere and in the world.
</UL>
<P>

	Panel members agreed that NAFTA's success could translate favorably into other free trade initiatives.  The results of the U.S. elections this November, however, will determine whether NAFTA leads to further progress in trade liberalization.  <I>(The Americas Program)</I><P>


 <LI> 	<B><a name="nato">NATO's Future:</a>  Looking Eastward.</B>  NATO enlargement is best thought of as an ongoing, open process consisting of several stages.  Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary are the most likely candidates for inclusion in the first round, concluded participants at a recent CSIS conference.  Although these countries support a robust NATO defense posture, their ambitions must be tempered to avoid provoking a Russian reaction.  Prospects for the second and third rounds of expansion, however, are plagued with serious dilemmas.  If the Balkan states are not assured of inclusion, anti-Western groups in many of those countries may exploit a domestic backlash.  Conversely, Russia is likely to pose even firmer resistance to future rounds, especially if they include the Baltic states.  Facing these dilemmas, the highest priority in the enlargement process is to establish a NATO-Russian partnership for achieving the common goal of stability in Central and Eastern Europe.<P>

	The United States has an interest in supporting a NATO enlargement that leaves room for the reintegration of Russia into the new European security context.  Many European NATO members may lack determination on the issue, but will ultimately follow American leadership.  That leadership, in turn, must be clearly articulated to the American public in terms of important national security interests if it is to overcome the divisive debates that enlargement occasions.  <I>(Political-Military Studies in conjunction with the European Studies Program)</I><P>


  <LI>	<B><a name="nkor">North Korea:</a>  Testing the Waters.</B>  North Korea's recent submarine incursion into South Korean territorial waters was not just another instance of Pyongyang's traditional strategy of brinkmanship.  Rather, it was part of the continuing, dangerous pattern of North Korean infiltration of special operations forces into the South.  These North Korean forces have two primary missions: to infiltrate activist student groups and labor unions and to perform reconnaissance on high-value targets in South Korea that the North would destroy quickly in the event of war.  These were the conclusions of Bill Taylor, CSIS senior vice president, in recent media appearances and in testimony before the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, Subcommittee on East Asia and the Pacific.  According to Taylor, Pyongyang has misread recent events in the Southóstudent riots, the sentencing of former political figures, and heated debates among political partiesóas signs of weakness.  The North's leaders do so at their own peril.  <I>(Political-Military Studies Program)</I><P>


 <LI> 	<a name="nuke"><B>Nuclear Black Market.</a></B>  "I believe it is a godsend for us," commented Senator Pete Domenici, referring to the CSIS report on the nuclear black market.  The findings and recommendations of this report contributed substantially to the Nunn-Lugar-Domenici amendment (Nunn-Lugar II) to the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1997.  (Both houses of Congress unanimously passed the amendment.)<P>

	The report proposed measures aimed at making nuclear theft and trafficking as costly, risky, and complex as possible so as to deter nuclear terrorism and to discourage organized crime from becoming further involved in nuclear smuggling.  Among the specific recommendations were: devising innovative ways to address warhead security; providing a layered defense against nuclear trafficking; developing healthy synergistic partnerships between law enforcement and intelligence here and abroad; taking a case-by-case approach to bilateral interdiction cooperation; enhancing deployment of technical sensors; specialized training of border control and other law enforcement officials; and detailed sharing and joint analysis of relevant intelligenceóespecially human intelligenceóthroughout the countries of origin, transit, and potential destination.  <I>(Global Organized Crime Project)</I><P>


 <LI> 	<a name="priv"><B>Personal Information Privacy.</B></a>  The new era of cyberspace and computer networking has led to growing concerns over the fair and appropriate handling of name-linked information.  The global nature of information flows has also highlighted the critical need to involve developing countries in establishing data protection regimes to prevent the advent of "data havens"ócountries or regimes that have lenient jurisprudence on privacy protection.  Data havens foster long-term barriers to the free flow of information because countries with established data protection laws would restrict their inflow and outflow of data to prevent groups located in data havens from misusing it.<P>

	Technological advances have rendered conventional data protection legislation obsolete.  Two major questions have now surfaced: Does the current legislation provide necessary safeguards against the misuse of personal information, and what roles must the private and public sectors play in protecting individual privacy.  "GIIC Personal Information Privacy PolicyóRecommended Actions," is an attempt to prompt companies and governments in both developed and developing countries to adopt appropriate policies and guidelines that ensure just and proper handling of name-linked data.  The paper specifies flexible measures to guide the collection and distribution of personal dataóincluding the participation of individuals in the use, processing, and quality of their informationóand also emphasizes the equal accountability of governments and the private sector in maintaining a high level of personal data protection within their own operations.  <P>

	The Coalition of Service Industries, a major industry group consisting of multinational service corporations, lauded the efforts of GIIC in preparing a truly globally oriented set of principles that can be endorsed by both corporations and governments around the world.  Data protection officials at the 18th International Conference on Privacy and Data Protection in Ottawa, Canada also acknowledged the contribution of the GIIC initiative in promoting private sector codes of protection and in raising awareness of this issue in developing countries.  <I>(<A HREF="http://www.gii.org/">Global Information Infrastructure Commission</A>)</I> <P>


<li>  <a name="reg"><B>Regulatory Reform:</a> Capital Markets.</B> The CSIS Capital Markets Regulatory Reform Project recently sponsored a roundtable discussion focusing on the development of an acceptable set of international accounting standards.  As the pace of cross-border securities activity has quickened in recent years, the issue of disparate regulatory standards has taken on heightened importance. While market participants and regulatory authorities are in general accord that development of acceptable international standards would facilitate the continued growth of truly global financial markets, progress has been slow and a number of critical issues remain unresolved.  Participating in the the forum were many of the key players in this important policy debate, including SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt; Commissioners Steve Wallman and Isaac Hunt; the SEC's Chief Accountant, Michael Sutton; Dennis Beresford, Chairman of the Financial Accounting Standards Board; representatives of the International Accounting Standards Committee; as well as senior executives from leading domestic and foreign companies.  Issues discussed included the status of the IASC's project to develop a core set of internationally acceptable standards, qualitative and quantitative comparisons between U.S. GAAP and non-U.S. standards, and whether U.S. listing standards should be modified to accomodate foreign issuers who do not reconcile with U.S. GAAP.  For more information on this forum and well as related events, please contact <A HREF="mailto: beltb@csis.org">Bradley D. Belt</A>, Executive Director of the Capital Markets Regulatory Reform Project.


<LI>  	<a name="russ"><B>Russia:</a>  The Fate of a Country.</B>  The burning topic across the world has been the state of health of Boris Yeltsin.  In view of the enormous powers conferred on the president by the 1993 constitutionówhich was tailor-made for Yeltsinóand his own management style of concentric and slightly overlapping subordinate spheres of power, the great ship of state has been drifting without a pilot since early July.  In numerous international media appearances, Keith Bush, senior associate of the Russian Studies Program, has addressed the succession scenarios should new elections be held in Russia.<P>

	If General Lebed makes a political comeback, the consequences for the West would be unpredictableóhe has changed his position frequently on key issues.  Furthermore, should his current economic adviser, Sergei Glaziev, be given a key post, the outlook for Western investment and business would be dim.  Gennadii Zyuganov will almost certainly try againóhis presidency would be catastrophic for the Russian economy and for Russia's relations with the West.  The other leading candidate, Yurii Luzhkov, would prove to be too assertive and aggressive as president.  He has, however, done much to attract Western business and capital to Moscow, and he would presumably continue such a beneficial policy for all of Russia.  A Chernomyrdin victory would be the most preferable outcome for the West, where he is a known quantity and is also seen as a reassuring and competent managerial figure. <P>

	The change in the business and investment climate in Russia since the presidential election is a second area of concern, especially for those Western and Japanese corporations thinking of doing business in Russia.  Russian government officials and business executives have been assuring their Western counterparts that 1996 will see a new tax code, which would reduce the number of taxes from about 150 to about 30, and a new and improved Production-Sharing Agreement to replace the defective document of December 1995.  These assurances have not been well-founded.  Given the composition of the new Duma, the allocation of key committee chairmanships to the Communists or their allies, and the spoiling powers of Sergei Glaziev, Lebed's economic adviser, the prospects for rapid forward movement in these two key areas are remote.  <I>(Russian and Eurasian Studies Program)</I><P>


 <LI> 	<a name="slov"><B>Slovakia:</a>  Developments in Democratic Pluralism.</B>  Given the heritage of apathy and helplessness from more than 40 years of Communist rule and the lack of any sense of community in their towns, both Slovaks and ethnic Hungarians from diverse social and functional sectorsówomen, youth, clergy, business, teachersóhave responded warmly to a CSIS initiative to promote democratic pluralism in Slovakia.  They welcomed the chance to begin making a difference in the future of their towns and were ready to learn and then model not only inter-ethnic tolerance but also cooperation as members of a community building civil society and democratic pluralism.<P>
	During the project, participants will come together and (1) define a vision of the best possible future for their respective town, (2) identify social, structural, political, and economic problems standing in the way of this vision, and (3) design projects to begin solving these problems.  The unusual and highly original aspect of the project is that there will be concrete products of the community-building leadership initiatives.  Participants expressed the hope that their successes in the project could set an example for the rest of the country.  <I>(Preventive Diplomacy Program)</I> <P>


<LI>	<a name="tech"><B>Technology Renders Regulatory Systems Obsolete.</a></B>  Regulatory systems have failed to keep pace with the technologically driven changes in global financial markets, thereby raising concerns about the ability of regulatory authorities to manage potential systemic crises.  There are several constraints on regulatory effectivenessóthe large and growing power of the global financial market system, which handles more than one and one-half trillion dollars of financial flows daily; the ability and willingness of market participants to engage in regulatory arbitrage; greater technical capabilities and financial resources in the private sector; and much longer decision-making cycles.  In the lead editorial in Global Investment magazine, Bradley D. Belt, director of the CSIS Capital Markets Regulatory Reform Project, also suggests that a fundamental reexamination of the existing scheme for regulating financial markets is required.  To accommodate marketplace developments, legal and regulatory standards across markets should be harmonized and consideration should be given to the creation of a supranational regulatory framework.  <I>(Domestic Policy Program)</I><P>


  <LI><B><a name="zaire">Zaire:</a>  What Next for the "Big Man" of Central Africa?</B> Zaire's first national election scheduled for next May and June will make 1997 the most crucial period in Zaire's history since its independence from Belgium in 1960, asserted U.S. Ambassador to Zaire Daniel H. Simpson at a CSIS briefing.  Zairians realize that help from the international community and the success of private ventures, including privatization, are dependent on a democratic political transition.<P>

	Optimistic about the elections, Ambassador Simpson believes that obstacles such as communications difficulties and the refugee crisis in Eastern Zaire need not prevent a free and fair vote and that Zairian "human capital" remains strong, despite years of oppressive government.  Civil society is gearing up for the polls, the campaign process is developing and becoming more sophisticated, and President Mobutu will likely face a serious challenge in the presidential election when voters confront a choice on the second ballot between the status quo and a new direction.  He warned, however, that the United States and the international community would not tolerate a rigged process.  <I>(African Studies Program)</I><P>

September 27, 1996</b><hr>

<h1>Time is running out for IFOR</h1>

<h3>What happens when the United States withdraws?

</h3>

The first effort to stop the bloodshed and ethnic cleansing in BosniaóUNPROFOR (the United Nations Protection Force)óproved unsuccessful; the fighting continued.  Then it was NATO's turnóenter IFOR (Peace Implementation Force).  With the December deadline for U.S. troop withdrawal fast approaching, IFOR's time is almost up.  What next?  Attention is shifting to the post-IFOR operation in Bosniaóspecifically, who will remain involved and whether they can maintain stability.  Janusz Bugajski, director of CSIS East European Studies, asserts, "If the world wishes to avoid regressing to the ineffective days of UNPROFOR, continued U.S. presence on the ground in Bosnia is essential." <P>


<B>IFOR Today</B><BR>
From a military standpoint, the IFOR operation has been a successóthe fighting between the Bosnian Serbs and the Muslim-Croat Federation has ceased, and IFOR has maintained inter-entity boundaries, kept roads open, and continued to monitor weapons in depots.  From a political and institution-building perspective, however, the results are not encouraging.  Bugajski contends that the shortcomings of the operation are clear.  IFOR has frozen realities on the ground without <P>

<UL><LI>reversing the effective ethnic cleansing in Bosnia;

<LI> weakening the hold of the nationalist parties that began the war; or

<LI>removing the war criminals who are responsible for the atrocities committed during the war.</UL>

In essence, IFOR is consolidating the process of the partition and division of Bosnia, and there remains a strong possibility of future wars among the three entities.  <P>


<B>Without Continued U.S. Involvement</B><BR>
An IFOR successor mission without direct support from the United States will place the entire operation under a European umbrella.  A "European IFOR-2," Bugajski warns, will be similar to an UNPROFORóalthough troops will not be subject to direct military attack, the Bosnian factions could start fighting again.  "The Bosnians do not respect European military power," Bugajski remarks.  "They believe that each European country has distinct great power interests in the area that favor one or another faction, interests Bosnians do not perceive the United States as having."<P>

Given this scenario, the longer-term prospect is that the country will splitóthe Croat side will drift to Croatia, the Serb side to Serbia, and what will be left is a radicalized Muslim statelet.  At this point, European troops will be caught in the middle of three emerging states with diametrically different interests.  Although the force probably will not be under military threat, it may find itself legitimizing the split into three entities.<P>


<B>The U.S. Difference</B><BR>
The NATO air strikes called for by the United States last year and the fact that U.S. soldiers are on the ground demonstrate that the United States is serious about its mission in Bosnia.  Bugajski notes, "There has always been a respect for the United States in Eastern Europe.  The United States will not stitch Bosnia back together; however, U.S. presence on the ground gives encouragement to the forces in Bosnia who want a multiethnic state.  This successor force would resemble more of an IFOR, not an UNPROFOR, operationóthe troops would not be threatened, and any major military action between forces would be highly unlikely during the course of NATO involvement. The ethnic division, however, will continue." <P>


<B>Impact on NATO</B><BR>
U.S. resistance to participating in a second IFOR-type operation could also challenge Alliance unity.  A U.S. troop withdrawal is likely to create resentment among the French and British in particular because they have had troops on the ground throughout both the UNPROFOR and IFOR operations.  Without U.S. participation, they may now be asked to shoulder most of the responsibility for Bosnian stability.

<h1>Bob Dole's Vision</h1>

         

<h3>Setting a new agenda for the United States in Asia</h3>

 

Speaking at the CSIS Statesmen's Forum yesterday, Senate Majority Leader and presumptive Republican presidential nominee Bob Dole sharply criticized President Clinton's Asian policy, calling it weak, incoherent, and indecisive.<P>



Dole then outlined his strategies for promoting strong U.S. leadership in Asia, citing the U.S.-China relationship and U.S. security relations with the Korean Peninsula and Japan as issues of primary importance.<P>



<H3>U.S. Policy toward China</H3>

Dole articulated his perspective on the salient issues of the U.S.-China relationship, including:<P>



 	<B>Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) Status.</B><BR>

  Dole advocated extending MFN status to China as the best way to promote U.S. national interests in the region.  Denying Beijing MFN privileges, Dole noted, "would not free a single dissident, halt a single missile sale, prevent a single threat to Taiwan

, or save a single innocent Chinese life."  Instead, he said such action would undermine U.S. interests in the region by sending the wrong signalónamely, that the United States is withdrawing from the region.  Such a message, Dole believes, would "set bac

k our relations [with China] more than two decades."  It would also have serious repercussions for U.S. relations with its allies throughout Asia and the Pacific. <P> 



 	<B>Taiwan.</B><BR>  The majority leader emphasized that U.S. policy on the Taiwan issue must be unequivocal, stating that "if force is used against Taiwan, America will respond. . . . The United States is lawfully committed and morally obligated to help

 Taiwan maintain the capacity to deter any effort to determine its future through violence."  Dole also called for sharing ballistic missile defense information and technology with Taipei.<P>  



 	<B>WTO Membership.</B><BR>  Addressing China's repeated violations of international trade rules, Dole specifically highlighted China's abuse of intellectual property rights laws, which cost U.S. businesses $2 billion annually.  He stated that China shou

ld be allowed into the WTO only after Beijing agrees to accept and adhere to the rules of the GATT system. <P> 

	Dole did not rule out imposing sanctions against China as a U.S. response to future Chinese transgressions. <P> 



<H3>U.S. Security Policy in Asia</H3>

 	<B>Expanding Defense Cooperation.</B><BR>

  Dole promoted a plan calling for close U.S. cooperation with Japan, South Korea, and other Asian allies for the purpose of developing, testing, and deploying ballistic missile defense systems to bolster current defense capabilities.  "It is time to anno

unce [U.S.] willingness to license exports of systems such as THAAD - Theater High Altitude Air Defense - and in the interim make operational prototypes available to our allies.  It is time to invite interested friends to send military personnel to train 

with U.S. army units already formed for THAAD launch."<P>



	The proposed "Pacific Democracy Defense Program" would counter the present security threat in Asia, i.e. the weapons proliferation policies of North Korea and China.  Furthermore, Dole asserted that this strategy would not only deter China and North Kore

a, it would also reduce incentives to produce ballistic missiles.<P> 



 	<B>Promoting a Harder U.S. Stance: North Korea.</B><BR>

  Dole delivered a scathing critique of current U.S. policy in the Korean Peninsula.  The administration, he remarked, is "showering [North Korean rulers] with aid, bilateral diplomacy, and technology" - offerings the North does not deserve - over objecti

ons from our true ally, South Korea.<P> 



	Dole called for the cessation of relations between the United States and North Korea until Pyongyang resumes discussions  with Seoul.<P> 



The presumptive Republican presidential candidate concluded his discussion with a call for the continued presence of the United States in Asia.  The U.S.-Asian relationship, Dole asserted, is indispensable to the U.S. national interest; cries to abandon o

ur commitment to our Asian allies must be vigorously opposed.

<h1>Opening China's Telecom Industry</h1>

<h3>A place at the table for foreign investors? 
</h3>

Current developments in China belie the government's official law governing the telecommunications industry, concluded CSIS experts in the <a href="http://www.csis.org/ics/">International Communications Studies</a> ProgramóDirector <a href="http://www.csis.org/html/4garriso.html">Bill Garrison</a>, Senior Associate <a href="http://www.csis.org/html/4pipe.html">Russell Pipe</a>, and Research Fellow <a href="http://www.csis.org/html/4fan.html">Xing Fan</a>.  

Officially, the Chinese government prohibits foreign firms from holding network equity ownership in the telecom industry and from direct involvement in network operation and service provisions.  "The fact is, however, that China's national informatization programóthe adoption of widespread applications of information technology for China's economic development and social progressórequires an enormous amount of capital that is beyond the nation's financial capability.  If China is to successfully complete this endeavor, the government must find a mechanism that will allow foreign capital infusions," asserts Garrison.  "My guess is that the Chinese government already knows this; it's just not saying so." <p>

Recent developments indicate that China will soon be compelled to open its telecommunications industry to investors. <p> 

	A number of provincial administrations are planning new wire-line networks primarily for the purpose of information-intensive applications instead of the traditional voice telephony.  This is significant because it represents a reversal of past priorities.  The Chinese now seem to be much more interested in advanced data applications; they are looking at technologies that would accommodate multiple service providers on their networks.  This then begs the question: If China is to have a structure where only one operator is providing these services, why is there so much interest in technology that would accommodate multiple service providers?<p>

One reasonable answer, Garrison concludes, is that network planners anticipate operating in an environment that will accommodate other service providers on the wire-line networks.  "Network planners don't operate in theoretical vacuums.  Someone had to tell them that this will be the government's priority; otherwise, they would not be wasting their time talking to multiple equipment vendors." <p>

Pipe adds that China is gearing up for high-capacity networks and rather large and practical applications that will require new structures in communication networks.  "Consequently, China will have to revamp its present telecommunications structure to accommodate such changesóthe pressure on China to be more open and more flexible in the telecommunications industry is intensifying."   <p>

How foreign firms fit it.  Although the most likely beneficiaries will be domestic competitors, foreign firms may be allowed to enter into joint ventures.  According to Fan, loopholes in the telecommunications legislation exist.  "The ownership issue is quite complex, and as more foreign companies enter the market and form alliances with Chinese enterprises, the demarcation of ownership between the two players will become even more blurred."  For example, China United Telecommunications Corporation (China Unicom), China's second national network operator and service provider, has recently signed more than 200 joint venture memorandums of understanding (MOUs).  In recent interviews, company officials estimated that more than 50% of the investment in Unicom has been from foreign sources.  "Unicom's strategy," explains Fan, "is to encourage foreign businesses to enter into joint ventures with local Chinese enterprises; in this way, foreign firms can invest in Unicom's projects without violating current rules." <p> 

There is another successful strategy that allows foreign firms to participate in the expansion of China's telecommunications capabilities.  According to this practice, referred to as BTA (build-transfer-assist), a foreign firm (1) builds a telecom facility or network with its investment and technology; (2) transfers the title to a local company; and (3) "assists" in the operation in terms of technical or management support.  "Technically the local enterprise operates the facility," states Pipe.  "However, because the Chinese have yet to define the word ëassist,' foreign firms have also been participating in the actual ëoperation' of the facility." <p>   

The bottom line, conceded Garrison, Pipe, and Fan, is that to keep up with the rapidly expanding demands on telecommunication infrastructure and sustain the health of the industry, foreign involvement will be required.  The long-term outlook for foreign investors and service providers is promising.

<h1>What is CSIS?</h1>



 <p>    The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) 
is a
     public policy research institution dedicated to policy 
analysis and
     impact.  CSIS is the only institution of its kind that 
maintains
     resident experts on all the world's major geographical 
regions.  It
     also covers key functional areas, such as international 
finance,
     the emerging markets, U.S. domestic and economic policy 
related
     to the Strengthening of America, and U.S. foreign policy and
     national security issues. </p> 

    <p> For more than three decades, the "strategic" approach of 
CSIS
     has emphasized long-range, anticipatory, and integrated 
thinking
     on a wide range of policy issues.  </p>

     <p>This approach is now more important than ever.  The end of 



the
     Cold War--while eliminating the danger of apocalypse--has
     ushered in accelerated change, new forces, increased
     complexities, shorter time frames for decisionmaking, and
     unprecedented challenges to leaders worldwide.</p>

<p>     The Center's <a href="http://www.csis.org/html/research.html">staff
</a>, consisting of 80 research specialists, 



80
     support staff, and 70 interns, is committed to generating 
strategic
     analysis on this "New World Disorder" by analyzing policy
     options, exploring contingencies, and making recommendations.
</p>

<p>     Founded in 1962 and located in Washington, D.C., CSIS is a
     private, tax-exempt institution.  Its <a 
href="http://www.csis.org/html/research.html">research</a> is 
non-partisan and
     non-proprietary.</p>

<p>     The Center's 1994 budget of $15 million was supported by
     contributions from corporations and individuals worldwide,
     foundation grants, non-classified contracts with the U.S.
     government, and revenue from its $15 million endowment.  To
     achieve longer-term financial security, the Center has 
launched a
     $60 million endowment campaign to build on its existing
     endowment of $15 million.</p>

March 1, 1996</h4>

<h1>U.S.-Japan Security Cooperation</h1>
         
<h3>The time for a broader approach?</h3>
 
The United States must broaden the scope of its security dialogue in East Asia.  It now has the opportunity to moderate the perception of distrust and frustration in its security relations with Japan.  It can achieve this by injecting longer-range issues of special concern across the Pacific into bilateral security agendas, such as the changing energy outlook in Asia.  This view is shared by three CSIS experts on U.S. relations with Japan: Princeton professor and <I>CSIS adviser Kent Calder</I>, <I>Pacific Forum CSIS Senior Associate Torkel Patterson</I>, and <I>CSIS Senior Adviser Bill Clark</I>.

At issue is the explosion of energy demand in Asia, which could eventually translate into a major Asian security and economic concern with implications for both Japan and the United States.  Unlike the disputes currently bedeviling U.S.-Japanese relations -- auto parts, photo film, semiconductors, U.S. military bases in Japan -- the energy issue offers a chance for constructive cooperation.  The April U.S.-Japan summit meeting between President Clinton and Prime Minister Hashimoto may be an appropriate staging point for exploring approaches with concrete benefits for both sides.<P>

Looming Energy Issues:  The economic surge in Asia is transforming the longer-term, global energy supply and demand calculus.  High growth rates are generating new, energy-intensive industries and creating a burgeoning regional middle class with increasing energy consumption.  Increased demand will soon mean higher levels of dependence for traditional energy importers.  It will also mean that several regional key energy exporters will become net importers.<P>

This dramatic increase in regional energy dependence will present a number of new security challenges in the region.  The new dynamics will also affect exporters and importers, and security relations between them, across the world.<P>

The sharp increase in demand affects virtually all the Asian economies apart from Japan:<P>

   At the core of the explosion is "greater China," consisting of China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan.  At present, China's population of 1.2 billion has a per capita energy consumption level only 40% of the world average.  But as consumer demand increases, energy demand will skyrocket.   According to Calder, whose definitive book, Pacific Defense: Arms, Energy, and America's Future in Asia,  has just been published, China could reach an oil import level of 1 million barrels a day (mbd) by the turn of the century and 2.5-3 mbd in 15 years (even assuming they will continue to burn coal mostly for electric power and home use).  If this level of oil demand materializes, greater China will account for more than 28% of the region's dependence by 2010.<P>

   Energy demand can also be expected to grow rapidly in India, the other regional giant, says Clark.  Increased consumption, coupled with the inability of the government to implement higher efficiencies in field management or in end-user energy consumption, will mean steadily upward energy requirements. <P> 

   In South Korea, the Energy Institute of Korea forecasts that aggregate energy demand will rise 128% from 1992 levels by the year 2010.  This increase in demand accounts for current conservation efforts, an expanded nuclear program, and extensive use of natural gas.  The figure could be higher, Calder adds, if tensions with North Korea are relaxed significantly or if unification occurs--making Korea's prospective energy challenges among the most significant in Asia.<P>

   The asean countries are also contributing to surging demand in Asia.  By Calder's calculations, Indonesia will become a net importer around the year 2002. Demand is also rising sharply in Thailand and Singapore.<P>

The Security Dimension:  All this points toward an added set of security challenges and concerns in Asia.  Currently, levels of 11 mbd of oil are moved each day by tankers from the Middle East to the region.  That level could increase to 17 mbd by the year 2005.  This raises the possibility of a "tanker-pipeline" stretching from the Middle East to Asia and highlights the dangers of the potential chokepoints in the Strait of Hormuz, the Indian Ocean, the waters around the Malay Peninsula (including the Malacca Strait), and the South and East China Seas.<P>

This is an important reason for the military shift in China from the development of a continental to a maritime force.  And such a shift suggests why the leading interests of the U.S. Navy need to be in the Pacific.<P>

It also helps explain the escalating security threats arising from competing territorial claims.   Clark notes that tension over the overlapping claims of Japan and Korea on the Takeshima/Tokdo islets could escalate over the next few weeks.  Calder pointed out that the Chinese have also recently had a drilling ship in Japanese-claimed waters near the Senkaku Islands (which have major offshore oil potential).  The potential for conflict over these zones may rise as energy pressures increase.<P>

Higher Asian oil dependence on the Middle East and other producers could also bring policy differences among the United States, Japan, and other Asian countries into sharper focus:<P>

   It places renewed emphasis on energy development in Central Asia, the pipeline politics there, and relations among Tokyo, Moscow, and Beijing.<P>

  It spotlights, as Calder points out, the "China-Iraq-Iran relationship" and the divergence between Washington's "dual containment" position and the policies of the Asian countries toward Tehran and, potentially, Baghdad.<P>

    And it brings into focus efforts by Tokyo to diversify its energy sources around the world, from the Middle East to Latin America.<P>


Exploring New Approaches: The stakes for Japan and the United States are significant.  Both have important national security interests in the outcome of this altered global energy calculus.  Both have high oil import levels--99% of total demand, in Japan's case.  And both can gain from fresh thinking and new joint approaches to issues of mutual concern.<P>

Says Calder: The political impact could also be important in Tokyo as a gesture of recognition of the sort of political-economic insecurities that the Japanese feel most deeply.<P>

Such new thinking could make energy efficiency a staging point.  The two countries could explore joint efforts to make new energy-efficient technologies available in Asia.  In the process, they could relieve some of the regional demand pressure.<P>

Another area of potential cooperation is in production, in which U.S. advanced drilling technology and other measures aimed at increasing production could be tied to Japanese expertise in end-user consumption savings and implemented with the support of both countries.  This is an important opportunity, says Patterson, for the United States "to plug into energy development in Asia" with big benefits to the U.S. economy.<P> 

Clark argues that we need to avoid a mere "Okinawa bandaid," and focus on meaningful strategies such as a joint energy strategy.  He notes: "This is an attractive idea because it is a way for the United States to introduce economic aspects into U.S.-Japanese dialogue without Tokyo's perceiving it as a U.S. threat to use energy as a weapon of persuasion."<P> 

It remains to be seen whether discussion of such a strategy will take place during the April summit.  But one thing is clear: To improve bilateral security relations scarred by Okinawa and trade tensions, the time for a broader approach has come.

<h1>Vietnam Puts on the Brakes</h1>
         
<h3>Implications for foreign investment . . .</h3>

 

Vietnam's much-anticipated Eighth Communist Party
Congress, which concluded its four-day deliberations
on July 1, 1996, brought little cheer to foreign
investors. Frustrated by a government that had yet to
demonstrate the political will to tackle major
impediments to investmentóa lack of transparency in
decision-making, inadequate legal and financial
infrastructures, and rampant corruptionóinvestors
found greater reason to worry as Vietnam's leaders
announced intentions to pursue a more cautious and
socialist line.<P>

Vietnam's paramount leader Do Muoi assured foreign
investors that they are integral to economic
development. Although the mood of the congress belied
this message, Keith Eirinberg, CSIS Fellow in Asian
Studies, believes that opportunities still exist for
businesses willing to invest their time, effort, and
money.<P>

<B>Ten Years of Doi Moi.</B><BR> The Party Congress
provided the
Communist leadership with the opportunity to review
the impressive results of 10 years of Vietnam's
economic reform program, doi moi: <P>
<UL>
<LI> 	inflation has plummeted from 774% in 1986 to
under 13% in 1995 and only 4-5% today;
<LI> 	GDP has nearly doubled and is at $93 billion;
<LI> 	economic growth rates between 1991 and 1995
have consistently remained above 8%; and
<LI> 	Hanoi has licensed more than 1,700 foreign
investment projects since 1988, with approved
projects worth more than $20 billion.</UL><P>

                       <B>The Next Five-Year
Plan.</B><BR>
Perhaps the most important message from the Party
Congress was that the economic reform program will
continue at a rapid pace. In fact, the new plan
outlined ambitious economic goals:<P>

<UL><LI>	annual GDP growth averaging 9-10%;
and
 <LI>	industrial output growing at 14-15% per
year.</UL><P>

                       Hanoi, however, intends to
support the large, inefficient state-owned firms that
siphon precious resources from the fledgling private
sector. Critics perceive such a strategy as
sabotaging Vietnam's plans for economic growth.<P>

<B>Septuagenarian Troika Remains.</B><BR>  Despite
rumors of a
transition to a younger leadership structure, the
country's ruling triumvirateóParty Secretary General
Do Muoi, 79, President Le Duc Anh, 76, and Prime
Minister Vo Van Kiet, 73ówas left in tact, but the
Politburo was expanded to 19 members, with only 4
recognized reformers among them. The increase of
high-level army and internal security officers in the
Party's ruling body reflects the new mood of
retrenchment, consolidation, and centralization.<P>

                       	<B>Yet Another Layer of
Bureaucracy?</B><BR>  Another significant development
of the
Congress, Eirinberg notes, was the formation of a
five-member Standing Committee for the Politburo.
Composed of the country's top three leadersóMuoi,
Anh, and Kietóthe political chief of the People's
Army, Le Kha Phieu, and Vice Interior Minister Nguyen
Tan Dung, this "super politburo" is weighted on the
side of the hardliners (Anh, Phieu, and Dung).
Although it remains to be seen what function this
committee will playóofficials claim its focus will be
only on day-to-day Party issuesóit could interfere in
decision-making on foreign investment projects,
especially in light of conservative concerns about
investors bringing in harmful cultural and social
influences. Eirinberg believes military and internal
security forces want greater control over reform,
perhaps to develop their own vested interests.<P>

	<B>Negative Signals for Foreign
Investors</B><P>

<UL><LI> 	The Congress failed to address the
key issue
of bureaucratic reform.

<LI> 	Party cells will be placed in foreign joint
ventures to complement those in Vietnamese partner
companies. The cells will relay workers' sentiments
to authoritiesóperhaps a result of recent labor
troubles in Korean and Taiwanese firms in Vietnam or
a way to watch militant trade unions closely. Foreign
firms, however, may see this effort resulting in the
politicization of the workplace and serving as an
intelligence source for Party bosses.

<LI> 	The Party is focusing on import substitution
and will apparently try to steer foreign investment
to specific areas in order to protect local
industries.</UL><P>

<b>On A More Positive Note</B><P>

<UL><LI> 	Minister of Planning and Investment
Do Quoc
Sam announced that revisions will be made to the 1987
Law on Foreign Investment this October that will
include simplifying procedures for obtaining land-use
permits and construction licenses.
<LI> 	The Party's final political report, compared
with the earlier draft, was less hard-line, with the
xenophobic rhetoric toned down considerably.<P>

<h1>What criteria does CSIS have for selecting projects?</h1>

     CSIS uses the following criteria when it decides whether or 
not to proceed with a new 
project:

<blockquote><p>Is it strategic?  Of pivotal importance?  
Anticipatory and forward-looking?</p>

<p>Does CSIS have a comparative advantage--substantive expertise 
and organizational 
strength--to exploit?</p>

<p>What kind of results, or product, will it generate?  Will the 
project have an impact on 
policy?  Will it change things for the better?  </p>

<p>Can multiplier effects be realized through CSIS research and 
its network?</p>

<p>Can the project be funded, and/or has a lead donor been 
identified?  Is it financially 
viable?  How long will it last?  When will it be sunsetted?</p>

<h3><a name="dilemma">The Haitian Dilemma: A Case Study in Demographics, Development, and U.S. Foreign Policy</a></h3>
<a href="http://www.csis.org/html/4preeg.html">Ernest H. Preeg</a><p>
The study relates longer-term Haitian development prospects to short-term U.S. policy objectives. The analysis focuses on the powerful demographic forces at play -- rapid population growth in the countryside, the relentless rural/urban migratory flow, and
 building pressures for outward migration to the United States. The central policy conclusion is that foreign policy actions, such as the international embargo to help restore the Aristide presidency, can have a devastatingly negative impact on the demogr
aphic and development outlook.<p>

The process of economic integration in North America involves more political cooperation than ever before.  The distinction between domestic and international policy is becoming increasingly blurred.  This study approaches this process from a national vie
wpoint rather than focusing on narrowly defined themes.  Two authors from each North American country examine their country's "hang-ups" regarding sovereignty, one from an economic perspective and the other from a political one. <p>

<h3><a name="rediscover">The Rediscovery of America: The Story of the Free Trade Agreement</a></h3>
Hermann von Bertrab<p>
Rarely before in the history of the Western Hemisphere has such monumental change occurred, as the United States, Mexico, and Canada have integrated their economies and united their destinies under the NAFTA agreement.  Three countries that had isolated t
hemselves during the last few centuries have rediscovered their common roots and interests under this modern treaty.  This insightful book, written by the chief Mexican representative for NAFTA in the U.S., offers an insider's perspective on the dramatic 
and arduous process of how NAFTA became a reality.<p>

There is strong feeling of unease in the region. Propelled by the globalization of politics and economics, the dynamics of regionalism in the Western Hemisphere is leading to a reconceptualization of U.S. policy. Among several possible configurations, the
 United States is likely to draw the most interest from those countries that are closest to it geographically, economically, and socially. In its broadest framework, this lends support to an expanded vision of a North American community.<p>

Are multilateral confidence and security building measures (CSBMs) appropriate to the Asia-Pacific region in the post-cold war era?  In recent years, regional attitudes regarding the acceptability or applicability of CSBMs appear to be changing.  This volume supports the assumption that CSBMs, if properly crafted and carefully applied, are indeed appropriate to the region and offers recommendations about the best ways to pursue them.<p>

<h3><a name="chinainfo">China in the Information Age: Telecommunications and the Dilemmas of Reform </a></h3>
<a href="http://www.scils.rutgers.edu/people/faculty/mmcv.html">Milton Mueller</a> and <a href="http://istweb.syr.edu/Project/Faculty/Tan.html">Zixiang Tan</a> <p>
This is the first comprehensive scholarly examination of China's economic reforms in the telecommunications sector. The book probes the inherent tension between global liberalization trends in telecommunications and information markets and the Chinese government's attempt to maintain a "socialist market economy" with centralized, one-party political control.
". . . a sophisticated, well-researched, and sensitive analysis of the enormous potential and contradictions in the Chinese telecommunications system. . . . It is a fascinating description of the complex Chinese process of modernization, reform, and reaction." - James R. Lilley, Former Ambassador to the People's Republic of China<p>

"China is an awakening economic giant but an information-age dwarf. Mueller and Tan examine China's torturous road to advanced information highways and provide a long-needed comprehensive volume on China's telecommunications system." - Eli M. Noam, Director, Columbia Institute for Tele-Information, Columbia University Graduate School of Business<p>

<h3><a name="common">Factors Affecting East Asian Views of the United States: The Search for Common Ground</a></h3>
David I. Hitchcock<p>
Based on more than 90 interviews in 7 East Asian countries, the author describes how positive images of the United States are fading in that region. East Asians still admire the United States' innovative spirit and idealism_even concerning human rights_and would welcome greater exchange and cooperation on social problems facing both the United States and the region. This would help attain a goal both deeply value: creation of a "civil society."<p>

<h3><a name="human">Human Smuggling: Chinese Migrant Trafficking and the Challenge to America's Immigration Tradition</a></h3>
Paul J. Smith, editor<br>
Contributors: Ko-lin Chin, Anthony DeStefano, Jack Goldstone, Marlowe Hood, Li Ling, Willard Myers,  Paul J. Smith, Su Xiaokang,  Kenneth Yates<p>
Trafficking in human beings from the People's Republic of China has emerged as a major immigration and security problem for the United States and other countries. More than three years after the smuggling ship, Golden Venture, carrying nearly 300 Chinese migrants ran aground off Queens, New York,  Chinese migrant trafficking into the United States not only persists but shows no sign of abating.  This illegal immigration is organized by highly effective alien smuggling organizations that use routes involving more than 30 countries,  according to the United Nations, and earn hundreds of millions of dollars. Moreover, it is a human rights tragedy -- those unable to pay their full transportation fees once they reach the United States are frequently locked up in "safe houses" where they are subjected to physical abuse until they can pay. The authors of this volume focus on the roots of this growth industry and examine the various "push" and "pull" factors_such as population pressures and, ironically, China's opening to the outside world -- that are fueling the current Chinese exodus.<p>

North Korea's resistance to dialogue with the International Atomic Energy Agency, the lack of forward motion in resuming North-South dialogue, and North Korea's testing of the Rodong 1, a missile with a 1,000-km range all clearly underscore the need for continued trilateral consultation in addressing these issues.

Conflicts that have divided parts of East Asia for the past 50 years remain unresolved: competing claims between China and Taiwan, past Japanese militarism and colonialism in the region, and the division of Korea into two ideologically opposed states.  Memories of the events that gave rise to these conflicts are contested.  Key to working through these memories, within and between nations, is the dialectical process of remembering and forgetting, which will deeply influence international relations in the region into the next century.<p>

<h3><a name="usjapsec">Restructuring the U.S.-Japan Security Relationship</a></h3>
Richard Douglas, editor<p>
Highlighted by the views of Mitsubishi CEO Ben Makihara and former assistant secretary of defense Carl Ford, this book examines the security challenges facing the world (notably the growing saliency of China and the volatile Korean peninsula) and the role the U.S.-Japan security relationship might play in confronting them. The alliance pressures caused by economic disputes, Japan's unique prohibition on collective self-defense, and the significant U.S. base presence in Japan are explored by an expert group with first-hand, real-world experience in managing this vital security relationship.<p>

The emergence of subregional economies_"natural economic territories"_raises serious questions about nation-state sovereignty.  In this examination of the subregional economy made up of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China's southern provinces, the authors seek to capture points of rift and accord at the governmental and provincial levels even as economic flows seem to be outpacing the central governments' abilities to manage them.<p>

The Forum was established in 1993 by CSIS, the Japan Institute of International Affairs, and the Russian Institute of World Economy and International Relations to foster candid discussion of regional and international security issues among private experts and policymakers. The Forum sessions have served to advance understanding of national perspectives on a variety of proposals to improve mutual confidence_particularly in the realms of military transparency and enhanced contacts. This report expresses the joint conviction that a trilateral framework can improve bilateral relations among the three nations and promote broader stability.<p>

<h1>The Second Coming of Facsism</h1>

         

<h3>Walter Laqueur on the potential of a new threat . . .</h3>

 

When the Communist empire collapsed, the final victory of liberal democracy was widely predicted. Events since then, however, do not bear out this optimism. Walter Laqueur, CSIS Kissinger chairholder, cochair of the CSIS International Research Council, and widely respected commentator on contemporary history, concludes that movements and regimes in the general tradition of the dictatorships of the 1930s (although not mere copies of Nazism and Italian fascism) could again come to power in various parts of the world. (FASCISM: Past, Present, Future, Oxford University Press, 1996) <P> 



<B>European Neo- and Post-Fascism</B><BR>  

Neo- and post-fascist parties are once again influential in Europe, particularly in Italy, France, and Austria. Despite discontent in these Western societies - rising crime rates, increasing unemployment, especially among the younger generation, and tension caused by the influx of millions of immigrants - Laqueur regards these present day neo-fascist parties as only a weak, second infusion of historical fascism, lacking both its extremism and dynamism. "Even if they are basically anti-democratic, they hide their true characterówhich fascism never didóto try to appear respectable and proclaim their attachment to democratic values and institutions."<P> 



Broadly speaking, asserts Laqueur, neo-fascism in Europe after 1945 has been a failure.  Post-fascism, however, finds fertile ground in the former Soviet empire and even more promising conditions in what was once the Third World, particularly in those countries where extremist religious movements have appeared.<P>



<B>Clerical Fascism</B> <BR>

Islamic fundamentalism (Iranian-style) has emerged as one of the most potent forces in the Middle East and parts of Africa, particularly in North Africa.  According to Laqueur, "there is an unmistakable kinship between Muslim radicalism and fascism; sometimes the affinities are uncanny." Common features of both movements include<P>



<BLOCKQUOTE>    - rejection of modernism and secularism;<P>

   - populist movements, totalitarian in nature, based on the resentment of an underclass that has not benefited from modernization but instead feels left out; <P>

   - absence of an economic doctrine, but opposition to Western-style capitalism (although not the ownership of private property), and distrust of the markets; and,<P>

   - use of violence to promote their message and achieve goals.  Extremist movements have turned to alternative measures such as terrorism and surrogate warfare.</BLOCKQUOTE>



<B>Post-Communist Fascism </B> <BR>

Present conditions in Russia - social tensions, economic difficulties, strong nationalist sentiments, the lack of deeply rooted democratic notions, and the political and ideological vacuum left by the collapse of communism - have created the opportunity for the extreme Right to successfully assert itself in the Russian political landscape.  And it has done so, in an alliance with the neo-Communists.<P>  



Laqueur notes that between 1991 and the present, a rapprochement between the anti-Communist Right and the neo-Communists "on a doctrinal level and also for practical reasons" has blurred their dividing lines.  Both groups now share a common enemy, and they understand that a joint effort is crucial to their success in Russia's uncertain political future. This alliance could well be the decisive factor in the coming Russian presidential elections this June.<P>  



<B>Prospects </B> <BR>

Laqueur concludes that although the victory of post-fascist regimes is not foreordained, it must now be seriously considered. The preconditions for fascism's second coming - a time of economic, social, and political crisis, when the current regime is incapable of dealing with urgent problems - are widely evident in the contemporary world, yet actions to alleviate current societal frustrations and citizen disenfranchisement are absent.  The progress of fascist movements, under different names and in different political attire, must be watched - especially at a time when means of mass destruction are far more accessible than in the past.

<a href="http://www.csis.org/html/4serfaty.html">Simon Serfaty</a><p>
The policies of the United States toward Europe have been among the most consistent, successful, and rewarding of the post-World War II period. To abandon Europe would be to ignore those policies' achievements_affluence, stability, and security_at huge cost to the interests of the United States. In the remaining years of this decade, Europe's fate will be determined by decisions that are yet to be made but can no longer be postponed. The United States is not being invited to preserve the status quo, but to enforce policies that respond to dual requirements -- transatlantic solidarity and European unity. The issues raised by the author -- from the instability of financial systems to information warfare and "virtual security" -- are both far-ranging and complete.<p>

In nine compact chapters the author manages to summarize succinctly the major political, economic, social, and diplomatic developments the country has confronted in the last two decades and the challenges it faces in the final decade of the 20th century. The major focus is on policies to enhance modernizing and developing an export oriented economy." - CHOICE<p>

Chaired by former EPA Administrator Bill Ruckelshaus, the Enterprise for the
Environment is attempting to forge a bipartisan consensus among key environmental
protection stakeholders in support of comprehensive,
concrete policy recommendations that will
lead to enhanced national environmental performance.<p><br><p>

<td>
By building a bipartisan consensus among the stakeholders in environmental protection, the project intends to develop comprehensive, concrete policy recommendations for
enhancement of national environmental performance.  As reflected in the
<a href="http://www.csis.org/html/e4e/summary.html">Project Summary</a>,
these policy recommendations -- to be presented to Congress and the Administration in 1997 -- would focus on three areas:
(1) transformation of the regulatory system administered by the Environmental Protection Agency;  (2) promotion of higher levels of stewardship in businesses regulated by EPA;  and (3) modification of key economic policies that drive public and private de
cisions
affecting the environment.  The outcome of adoption of those recommendations, it is envisioned, would be the attainment of "cleaner, cheaper, fairer"
environmental results.<p>

<b>Project Leadership</b><br>
The project is chaired by <a href="http://www.csis.org/html/e4e/ruckbio.html">Bill Ruckelshaus</a>, who
twice served as EPA Administrator, the first time when the Agency
was founded in 1970 and the second when the Agency needed revitalization in 1983.   Appointees of both
political parties are among the three other former Administrators -- Doug Costle, Lee Thomas and Bill Reilly -- and two former Deputy Administrators who have joined him in the project.<p>

<b>Stakeholder Members</b><br>
The project includes over 90 members, selected to be representative of the
diverse stakeholder interests in environmental protection.   Included in the
<a href="http://www.csis.org/html/e4e/steercom.html#stake">Stakeholder
Roster</a> are government officials
(Members of Congress from both Houses and both political parties, State Governors and Attorneys General, local Mayors, and directors of State environmental regulatory and related agencies);  representatives of regulated businesses, environmental
and conservation organizations, organized labor, and the environmental justice movement;  and experts from
Universities and other policy forums.   The project has the support of EPA, which is represented by the Agency's Deputy Administrator, Fred Hansen.<p>

<b>Institutional Partners</b><br>
The project involves collaboration by three institutions:  the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS);  the Keystone Center;  and the <a href="http://www.lmi.org/napa/">National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA)</a>.  (1) CSIS convened



the stakeholder process and is providing overall project direction, analytical support and financial development through the Project Director, Karl Hausker, Ph.D, and his staff.  (2) Keystone designed and is facilitating the stakeholder process, with its



staff efforts directed by John Ehrmann, its Executive Vice President.  (3) NAPA (which previously prepared a report, commissioned by the Congressional Appropriations Committees, about the environmental protection system administered by EPA) will
provide analytic support to the stakeholder process through staff directed by DeWitt John, Director of the Center for the Economy and the Environment.  The NAPA work will include a case study report, overseen by an independent panel, on recent efforts by
EPA
and others to promote more effective and efficient environmental management. <p>

<b>Organizational Structure</b><br>
The stakeholders have divided themselves among various <a href="http://www.csis.org/html/e4e/actiongp.html">Action Groups</a> to work on specific topics under the direction of designated co-chairs.  The Action Groups, in turn, take guidance from a <a href



="http://www.csis.org/html/e4e/steercom.html">Steering Committee</a> of some 35 stakeholders.  The Action Groups will present points on which they concur, or competing options, to the Steering Committee,
which will seek to agree upon a set of recommendations to present
to the stakeholders for endorsement. <p>

<a name="relevant"><b>Available Documents</b></a><br>
Under the project's groundrules, in an effort to promote
free
exchange of ideas in this consensus-building endeavor, participants agree
not to
attribute suggested ideas or proposals to other participants and not to circulate draft "works in progress"
that have not yet won approval by the group-at-large.  Accordingly, few if
any working papers generated by the project are currently available to
interested outside parties. The
participation of representatives of the various stakeholder interests is intended to
provide the vehicle for the incorporation of a wide range of viewpoints.
Once project recommendations emerge, they will be subject to full public
review before adoption. <p>

Those documents that are accessible either were already identified in the preceding paragraphs or may be categorized as follows: <p>

<ul>
<li>Reports and analyses that might help the reader put the project in context:  (1) the 1995 NAPA report, and its <a href="http://www.lmi.org/napa/setprior.html">Executive Summary</a>, entitled "Setting Priorities, Getting Results:  A
New Direction for EPA";  (2) the "Stopping the Pendulum" speech delivered by Mr. Ruckelshaus in receiving the Environmental
Law Insitute's Annual Award in October, 1995, and later
published under the same title in ELI's Environmental Forum of November/December 1995;  and (3)
the March, 1996 report of the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/EOP/pcsd/index.html">President's
Council
on
Sustainable Development</a>, entitled "Sustainable America: A New Consensus for Prosperity, Opportunity and a Healthy Environment."

<li>Communications from Chairman Ruckelshaus describing the project and reflective of its evolution:  (1) his February 29, 1996 testimony to the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on VA-HUD-Independent Agencies;  (2) the accompanying CSIS/Keystone/NAPA <a



 href="http://www.csis.org/html/e4e/press417.html">press release</a> annnouncing the launching of the project;  (3) his April 17, 1996 testimony to the House Appropriations Subcommittee on VA-HUD-Independent Agencies, reflecting a broadening of the projec
t
scope; (4) his speech to a Resources for the Future forum in 1996, describing the project's evolution; and (5) a series of <a href="http://www.csis.org/html/e4e/update.html">"project updates"</a> sent at intervals during 1996 to those interested in
 the project's progress.

<li>Informational documents reflecting the efforts of the project's "International Perspectives Project" to analyze the environmental protection sysytems of other countries and to draw lessons that might be instructive for the U.S.  These documents, which



 did not undergo any consensual  process within the project, include (1) <a href="http://www.csis.org/html/e4e/rndtable.html">summaries of various roundtable discussions</a> that were held, and (2) a
manuscript by the Netherlands' Director-General for Environment describing the workings of the Dutch system in great detail.
</ul><p>

<hr width=150>

The current schedule calls for the final project recommendations to be made in April, 1997.  Once issued, those recommendations, as well as the NAPA panel's case study report, will be acccessible through this site.</td></tr> </table>

<h3><a name="icg">International Consultative Group on the Middle East</a></h3>
The ICG brings together a select group from the Middle East, the United States, and Europe (from the policy community, the business world, and academia) for a continuing dialogue. The ICG focuses on the fundamental trendsóglobal and regional, economic, political, and securityóconfronting the Middle East. A meeting in Jordan is planned for December 1996. <p>

<h3><a name="dynamic">Middle East: Dynamic Net Assessment</a></h3>
This initiative is providing a comprehensive, updated look at the strategic environment in the Middle East, taking account of the most recent political and military developments in the region. The project is completing net assessments of the Arab-Israeli peace process and military balance, developments in Mahgreb, and country studies of Bahrain, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, which are being reviewed by the Gulf countries and will be published in 1996 as a series of six books by Westview Press. It is now exploring new options for Gulf cooperation and developing an economic, political, and strategic model of the possible future of the Gulf through the year 2020 in regional security, particularly the security of U.S. allies and of U.S. strategic interests.  Other studies include the demographics and sources of ethnic and sectariation conflict, patterns in arms transfer, and the nuclear, chemical, and biological forces of Middle Eastern States. <p>

<p><hr><p>

<h3><a name="newmideast">The New Middle East: Long-Term Trends and Developments</a></h3>
This series of seminars, lectures, and working groups focuses on political, economic, and strategic developments in the region, in which Iran and Iraq are of particular importance. The implications for energy security, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and the Western democracies' increasingly divergent policies toward Iran and Iraq are major areas of study, along with the Arab-Israeli peace process. Socioeconomic and political issues, which are often the true causes of instability, as well as economic restructuring and experiments in democratization are topics being examined in the light of new realities in the Middle East. <p>

September 10, 1996</h4>

<h1>The Iraqi Thorn</h1>

<h3>CSIS analysts assess
developments in Iraq .  .  . </h3>

<I>In more than 120 television appearances and radio interviews throughout the past week, CSIS analysts provided a thorough analysis of the crisis in Iraq. A summary of their thinking follows:</I><P>

<I>Tony Cordesman, Co-Director, Middle East Studies:</I><BR>
                       "Given the constraints that the United States facesóand the fact that there are no good optionsóthe president has acted wisely.  There is no instant, moral, and lasting solution to the Iraqi problem.  The frustrating game of  ëchallenge and response' will arise repeatedly, and we need to be prepared to react to subsequent, low-level confrontations with similar proportionate responses."<P>

"What is equally important is that Saddam Hussein is scarcely our only problem.  As long as aggressive, authoritarian regimes rule Iraq and Iran and continue to search for hegemony in the Gulf, the United States and the international community will face similar situations.  The Gulf region has 60 percent of the world's oil reserves, and we need to accept the fact that we must contain Iran's and Iraq's aggressiveness until fundamental political changes occur within those countries."  <P>

<I>Judith Kipper, Co-Director, Middle East Studies:  </I><BR>
"The latest U.S. action in Iraq was entirely appropriate.  It demonstrated that the United States will act decisively when challenged by Saddam Hussein's aggressive military actions.  Military force is the only language Saddam understands."  

"However, the failure of the United States to protect the Kurdish population from Saddam Hussein and U.S. abandonment of northern Iraq is morally, politically, and strategically unacceptable.  We may see an even more threatening situation in the near future in an area that the United States has assumed responsibility for protecting."<P>

"The recent crisis clearly illustrates the inconsistency of U.S. Gulf policy.  Dual containment is merely a slogan.  An effective policy should aim to integrate both Iran and Iraq into a Gulf security mechanism instead of having them constantly challenge it."  <P>

<I>Bill Taylor, Director, Political-Military Studies: </I><BR>
"The U.S. response to Iraq's latest military incursion was justified but insufficient.  U.S. leadership and credibility were at stake.  Given that we are the main force behind Operation Provide Comfort, Saddam Hussein will continue to test our resolve and attempt to divide the coalition that won the Gulf War.  He understands power politics and will respond favorably only to overwhelming force."<P>

"Some states may condemn the United States for its use of military force in Kurdistan.  They would, however, join forces with us again to prevent Iraq from killing our allies in the Gulf region and seizing oil fields."<P>

<I>Daniel GourÈ, Deputy Director, Political-Military Studies:</I><BR>
"The crisis demonstrates that after five-and-a-half years of Saddam Hussein, the United States still lacks an effective policy for dealing with Iraq.  The administration's responseó44 cruise missilesówas driven by domestic electoral concerns and short-term tactical military considerations.  It was a tactical blunder and a strategic disaster."<P>

"Consequently, we must realize that the implications are significant.  U.S. action marks a watershed in our policy toward Iraq and the Northern Persian Gulfóit has exacerbated the fraying of the Gulf War coalition.  If we don't change our policy, we should expect to see our strategic situation, our ability to influence events, and our military and defense presence in the Gulf deteriorate."<P>   

<I>Ryan Henry, Senior Fellow, Political-Military Studies:</I><BR>
"Given what the U.S. objectives wereóto demonstrate our leadership and to ensure stabilized delivery of petroleum products out of the Gulfóthe U.S. response was appropriate.  In addition, the United States accomplished a long-term military goalótightening the noose around Saddam Hussein to prevent him from any attempt to move to the south and threaten his oil-rich neighborsóby using the problem of Kurdistan as an excuse to intervene in Iraq."<P>

"Unfortunately, the implications of this situation are long-lasting.  What we will see is Saddam's continued attempts to redefine the boundaries of the box in which he has been confined by the United Nations.  In turn, the United States will use every such opportunity to further compress that box while supporting our strategic interests in the region." <P>

"As long as the Kurdistan region straddles oil fields and oil transportation points, it will not become a sovereign nation-state.  Furthermore, the United States must refrain from getting involved in this situation.  Kurdistan is a Bosnia-in-waitingóthere is no viable exit strategy and once the United States pulls out, the fighting will resume."

<title>CSIS Constituencies</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor=#ffffff>
<p align="center"><img src="http://www.csis.org/images/3missio.gif"></p>
<h1>What constituencies does CSIS serve?
</h1>
     The answer is straight-forward: decision-makers across the 
world.  Leaders in 
Congress, the Executive Branch, and in parliaments abroad; leaders 

in the international private 
sector; leaders in academia and research communities representing 
diverse countries and 
perspectives; opinion leaders in the media; and the general 
public: 

<blockquote>
<p><b>Congress: </b> Last year, more than 100 members of the U.S. 
Congress were actively 
engaged in CSIS projects ranging from the NAFTA and Beyond 
Commission to the Center's work on 
global organized crime.  Members of Congress and their aides draw 
regularly from the real-time 
analysis and the examination of long-term issues by Center 
scholars.</p>

<p><b>Executive Branch:</b>  The U.S. Executive Branch faces the 
challenge of overcoming 
compartmentalization, short-term focus, lack of initiative, and 
bureaucratic inertia.  CSIS, 
with its catalytic and synergistic approach, is an invaluable 
resource for government officials 
in every agency.  Last year, hundreds of Executive Branch 
officials participated in CSIS 
projects.</p>

</p><b>Leaders from Other Countries:</b>  Policymakers from other 
countries also play an 
important role in the Center's projects.  The Center engages 
political leaders ranging from 
heads of state to parliamentarians by providing forums for 
discussion of key issues.</p>

<p><b>Business Community: </b> A major priority at CSIS is to 
bring private-sector expertise 
and experience to bear in addressing international policy issues.  

Last year, more than 100 
CEOs from more than 30 countries took part in CSIS action-oriented 

projects designed to achieve 
concrete results.  The international private sector also draws 
extensively on CSIS insight on 
all areas of the world.</p>

<p><b>Academic/Research Community: </b> Apart from its in-house 
experts, CSIS draws from the 
insight of world-class universities in several countries through 
the eminent scholars 
participating in its International Research Council.</p>

<p><b>Media/General Public: </b> In terms of public education on 
policy issues, CSIS analysts 
appears regularly on television and radio and author opinion 
pieces, articles, and books in the 
print media across the world.</p>

<td valign=top>
<h3><a name="brazil">Brazil and South America</a></h3>
Brazil is returning to its traditional status as a significant counterpart to U.S. policy initiatives in the Western Hemisphere. This appears particularly the case with Brazil's leadership in MERCOSUR. CSIS is expanding its assessment of these dynamics and also expecting the impact of these developments for South America's other key actors: Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela. Guiding this initiative will also be interaction of the agenda with U.S. congressional interest. <p>
<i>(<a href="http://www.csis.org/html/4fauriol.html">Georges A. Fauriol</a>, Director, Americas Program)</i>

<p><hr><p>

<h3><a name="canada">Canada Project</a></h3>
This project provides policymakers, corporate strategic planners, and international media with timely analysis of Canada and U.S.-Canadian relations. Issues such as trade and investment, the environment, energy, and the competitiveness of the post-NAFTA auto industry are addressed through regular seminars, publications, congressional outreach, and business briefings. Additional outreach includes the CSIS Canada Briefing, a monthly roundtable that offers an in-depth assessment of trade and economic issues. <p>
<i>(<a href="http://www.csis.org/html/4fauriol.html">Georges A. Fauriol</a>, Director, Americas Program)</i>

<p><hr><p>

<h3><a name="carib">Caribbean Studies</a></h3>
The issues at the core of this initiative include the emerging global trend toward free market economics and democratic political governance, a decrease in foreign aid, increasing threats from narcotics trafficking, and major leadership changes. A new project attempts to identify the character and sources of the new generation of leaders and will include a group of emerging young leaders who will be engaged on a broad range of issues. In addition to this core research agenda, the Center is devoting special attention to the decade-long crisis in Haiti and is continuing its long-standing monitoring of Cuban policy. <p>
<i>(<a href="http://www.csis.org/html/4fauriol.html">Georges A. Fauriol</a>, Director, Americas Program)</i>

<p><hr><p>

<h3><a name="mexcong">Congressional Study Groups on Mexico and Canada</a> </h3>
The Study Group on Mexico has more than 15 active members, including Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Bob Graham (D-FL) and Representatives Jim Kolbe (R-AZ) and Bill Richardson (D-NM). The Study Group on Canada is chaired by Representatives John McHugh (R-NY) and Jim Oberstar (D-MN). Each group brings together members of Congress for off-the-record briefings, as well as larger meetings geared toward a broader audience on bilateral issues such as elections, trade, environment, transportation infrastructure, democratization (Mexico), and national unity (Canada). <p>

<p><hr><p>

<h3><a name="meltdown">Decision-making and Policy Implications of the Mexican Financial Meltdown</a></h3>
The project is designed to examine the decision-making by the Mexican government, the U.S. government, and the IMF during the 18 months prior to the devaluation of the peso on December 20, 1994. The main purpose of the project is to determine why certain decisions were made and why a policy of increased vulnerability was tolerated for so long. The project will make recommendations for future financial policy for Mexico and will suggest a more orderly way for the international community to deal with future financial rescues. <p>
<i>(<a href="http://www.csis.org/html/4weintra.html">Sidney Weintraub</a>, William E. Simon Chair in Political Economy)</i>

<p><hr><p>

<h3><a name="democracy">Democracy in the Western Hemisphere</a></h3>
Although the Western Hemisphere has opened up politically over the past decade, the environment remains fragile. To chart this trend, the CSIS Western Hemisphere Election Study Series has issued more than 125 analyses of presidential and local elections since 1982, with eight studies in 1995. Americas Program staff have also participated in election observation delegations, testified before Congress, and held pre- and post-election briefings. <p>
<i>(<a href="http://www.csis.org/html/4fauriol.html">Georges A. Fauriol</a>, Director, Americas Program)</i>

<p><hr><p>

<h3><a name="mexico">Mexico Project</a></h3>
This project addresses critical issues on the U.S.-Mexican agenda, such as free trade, democratization, the environment, immigration, judicial reform, and counternarcotics efforts. The project's policy roundtables, congressional briefings, and publication series have engaged prominent Mexican and U.S. private sector leaders, policymakers, and academics. Mexico is undergoing profound economic and political transformations, which underscore the strategic significance of the U.S.-Mexican relationship. In addition, a new study, "NAFTA: Two-and-one-half Years Later," being undertaken by the Simon Chair and the Mexico Project, will demonstrate that NAFTA largely protected U.S. exports to Mexico in the aftermath of the peso collapse. <p>
<i>(<a href="http://www.csis.org/html/4baer.html">M. Delal Baer</a>, Deputy Director, Americas Program, and Director, Mexico Project)</i>

<p><hr><p>

<h3><a name="auto">North American Auto Industry Study</a></h3>
No sector is more important to the success of NAFTA than the auto industry. Motor vehicles and parts are the largest item in bilateral trade between the United States and Canada, the United States and Mexico, and even between Canada and Mexico. NAFTA acknowledged the high degree of integration in the auto sector, but also made it imperative that the three governments rethink their policy approaches to the regulation and promotion of auto manufacture, research and development, and trade with a view toward greater trilateral cooperation, coordination, and harmonization. Guided by a private sector task force made up of the chairmen of General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler as well as major automotive suppliers such as TRW, this study will tackle key issues in the areas of labor, environment, trade policy, market integration, and the future role of Canada and Mexico in automotive production. <p>

<p><hr><p>

<h3><a name="mercosur">U.S.-MERCOSUR High-Level Working Group</a></h3>
CSIS launched this working group to strengthen U.S. relations with the five MERCOSUR countriesóArgentina, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay. The group emphasizes business, financial, and economic relations among the five countries. To accomplish its goals, the group triggers country-specific and regional initiatives, such as the U.S.-Argentine Caucus. A specialized counterpart for U.S.-Brazilian relations, which will include a bilateral congressional component, is in formation. <p>

<h1>Tapping the Caspian</h1>

<h3>The stakes are high .  .  . 
</h3>

Six years after the collapse of communism, territorial claims to the Caspian Sea have yet to be resolved.  The Caspian, once the domain of the Soviet Union and Iran, is now surrounded by five sovereign statesóRussia, Iran, Azerbaijan, Kazakstan, and Turkmenistanówith conflicting interests.  A major issue of contention is whether the Caspian is a sea or a lake.  <P>

The distinction is significant.  If the Caspian is considered a lake, all five of the riparian states must reach a consensus before development of its resources can commence.  As a sea, however, jurisdiction is divided according to the Law of the Sea, which would give each state its own sector of the waters.  <P>

Of the five players, Russia has the most to lose if the Caspian is officially deemed a sea: the largest oil and gas reserves, readily accessible to the Russian market before the collapse of the Soviet Union, are located in Azerbaijan, Kazakstan, and Turkmenistan. <P> 

The potential of the Caspian basin's oil and gas deposits and the fact that most of the oil to be produced will be for the export market have also piqued the interest of multinational oil companies from the United States, Great Britain, and Norway. <P> 

<B>Impediments to Development.</B>  Given that three of the five littoral states are landlocked, pipelines to transport the oil and gas to foreign markets are a major priority.  Unfortunately, determining routings has become nearly impossible.  "Pipeline politics have become the issue of the day," says Bob Ebel, director of the CSIS Energy and National Security Program.  "It seems no matter which direction planners might look, each prospective route faces political challenges from dissident or separatist activity."  In the case of Azeri oil, for example, the two best options for pipeline routings pass either directly through the heart of Chechnya or within a few kilometers of the disputed enclave Nagorno-Karabakh. <P> 

Kazakstan faces similar challenges.  Although the best route for transporting oil from the offshore Tengiz field to the Black Sea port of Novorossiisk passes through politically quiescent territory in Russia, Kazakstan must contend with Russia's desire to control the oil.  Other options are less viable.  To the west, civil wars in the Caucasus Mountains create a precarious situation, and to the south lies politically controversial Iran. <P>    

Ebel underscores that Russian involvement is essential.  "It is quite evident that there can be no game unless Russia is invited to play.  That has held true for oil field development offshore Baku, for developing the giant Tengiz field in Kazakstan and the building of an export pipeline to Novorossiisk, for the future of the Karachaganak gas condensate deposit in Kazakstanóprobably the largest such deposit in the world, and for Turkmen natural gas."<P>

<B>Russia's Internal Schism.</B>  Recognizing that Russian participation is critical in tapping the wealth of the Caspian Sea is a step in the right direction.  Bulent Aliriza, director of the CSIS Turkish Studies Project, notes, however, "what Russia wants is not clear; the government lacks any unifying policy."  The Russian Foreign Ministry opposes the current development plans because they do not grant Russia a special status in any littoral country's oil or gas production projects.  In addition, the ministry does not want the former Soviet states to gain the economic independence that would result from oil and gas revenues.  On the other hand, the Ministry of Fuel and Energy is willing to allow the oil to reach foreign markets on Russian terms; a position also held by Russia's oil and gas industry. <P>

<B>U.S. Involvement.</B>  In addition to the U.S. energy industry, which has invested heavily in Caspian Sea development projects, the U.S. government also has a vested interest in ensuring that Caspian resources are exported to foreign markets, with Russia's consent.  "There is massive, yet discreet, U.S. involvementófrom Vice President Al Gore on down.  Day-to-day cooperation occurs between the U.S. government and the Russian Ministry of Fuel and Energy," Aliriza remarks.  "The U.S. government has staked a lot of prestige on integrating Russia into the international free trade system." <P> 

Aliriza believes the United States is trying to demonstrate that the Russians want to be involved in the global free market by persuading them to allow the oil to reach the market with Russia's blessing, albeit at a cost.  "Such a resolution, if successful, could set the stage for the post-Soviet relationship between the Western economic system and the economic systems of Russia and the former Soviet states; it could potentially help fashion the post-Cold War world."

<a href="http://www.scils.rutgers.edu/people/faculty/mmcv.html">Milton Mueller</a> and <a href="http://istweb.syr.edu/Project/Faculty/Tan.html">Zixiang Tan</a> <p>
This is the first comprehensive scholarly examination of China's economic reforms in the telecommunications sector. The book probes the inherent tension between global liberalization trends in telecommunications and information markets and the Chinese government's attempt to maintain a "socialist market economy" with centralized, one-party political control.
". . . a sophisticated, well-researched, and sensitive analysis of the enormous potential and contradictions in the Chinese telecommunications system. . . . It is a fascinating description of the complex Chinese process of modernization, reform, and reaction." - James R. Lilley, Former Ambassador to the People's Republic of China<p>

"China is an awakening economic giant but an information-age dwarf. Mueller and Tan examine China's torturous road to advanced information highways and provide a long-needed comprehensive volume on China's telecommunications system." - Eli M. Noam, Director, Columbia Institute for Tele-Information, Columbia University Graduate School of Business<p>

This companion volume to The Information Revolution and National Security brings together a diverse set of experts from the business, military, government, and academic communities to consider the implications of new information technologies for international security. The focus is not so much on security in the strict military sense as it is on the global social, economic, and political changes occurring because of new information technologies and their potential effects on the international security environment_for example, the effects of speed and global networks on the conduct of diplomacy as well as conflict.  This provocative, informed exploration will be of interest to policymakers, legislators, and others involved with the global security issues accompanying this revolution.<p>

<h1>Transatlantic Defense Cooperation</h1>
         
<h3>An opportune time . . .</h3>
 
Slashed defense budgets, defense industry consolidation, and increasing involvement in coalition operations characterize the new post-cold war environment for players on both sides of the Atlantic.  Cognizant of these current trends and of the past failures in adopting transatlantic collaborative defense agreements, the CSIS Atlantic Partnership Project, a commission of leading defense industry executives, has cautiously crafted its final report, Making Transatlantic Defense Cooperation Work.  The recommendations outlined below represent an unprecedented multilateral consensus by the world's leading defense corporations.<P>

<B>The Rationale</B><BR>
 	The U.S.-European strategic alliance is increasingly defined by joint military participation in multinational operations.  This new dimension  underscores the increasing importance of U.S.-European military interoperability.<P>
 
 	Complete autarky in the development and production of defense systems is no longer feasible due to the severe and continuing contractions of U.S. and European defense budgets and the spiraling cost of developing new technologies.<P> 

 	Cooperation can save money by spreading the risk of technology development and providing economies of scale in production and logistics costs.  Cost sharing may also allow governments to continue with technological developments that otherwise would have been too expensive for them to undertake alone.<P>  

 	Cooperation can sustain expertise.  If an agreement can be reached that allows companies to receive a fair return approximately proportional to the national investment, then cooperation would help governments maintain employment and technology expertise that would otherwise have been lost.<P>  

 	In the long term, defense cooperation will be beneficial to both the United States and Europe.  Although the United States enjoys a defense trade surplus with Europe -- 1993 sales for the top 10 U.S. defense companies were approximately $6 billion versus $3 billion in sales for their top 10 European counterparts -- the movement in Europe toward defense industry integration and European governments' efforts to strengthen the "European preference" to make their firms more competitive will make it increasingly difficult for U.S. companies to penetrate the European defense market as successfully as they have in the past.<P> 

<B>Two Sets of Recommendations  </B><P>
(1) A framework agreement for specific programs on which governments have agreed to cooperate. <P> 

Participating governments would:<BR>
 <UL>
<LI>	coordinate technology transfer and security rules;

<LI> 	permit companies to determine the distribution of work content, technology development, and program management;

<LI> 	provide continued support for cooperative programs through clear and well-defined funding milestones;

<LI> 	approve an accounting system for contributions to the program; and

<LI> 	permit companies to export the collaborative system to third-country destinations that governments have identified in 
advance, without further legislative restrictions. 
</UL>
(2) A broad strategy to encourage the opening of domestic defense markets.  Opportunities are emerging from Europe's transition to a more integrated defense sector, including<BR>

 <UL><LI>	
European governments as more effective interlocutors with the United States on collaborative programs; and

 	
<LI>Greater consistency among the different national European procurement practices and policies that  enable U.S. and European firms to operate in a more transparent and predictable market.</UL>
  
It is time for governments on both sides of the Atlantic to take transatlantic defense cooperation more seriously. The United States and Europe cannot afford to risk a more pronounced polarization between their respective defense markets.<P> 

To work toward strengthening the U.S.-European defense relationship, European governments should ensure that their defense market remains open to competition and cooperation by avoiding new forms of protectionism, working to develop a more coherent and transparent defense market and continuing the process of rationalizing and privatizing European defense companies. <P>   

The U.S. government must refrain from adopting legislation  that insists on sole-sourcing from U.S. firms, strengthen and extend the exemptions from "Buy America" legislation for allied countries, and revise critical items lists and other mobilization base restrictions to allow European systems to compete in a broader range of U.S. programs requirements.<P>

August 8, 1996</h4>

<h1>Gaining Momentum</h1>

<h3>South Africa proceeds
on the right track  .  .  . 
</h3>

The U.S.-South Africa Binational Commission (BNC) meetings held in Washington on July 22-23, 1996, signaled a high point in bilateral relations between the two countries.  The South African delegation, led by Thabo Mbeki, South Africa's deputy president, and its U.S. counterpart, led by Vice President Al Gore, deepened the impact of existing, creative programs in diverse areasóbusiness development, human resource development, agriculture, environment, energy, and science and technology.  Perhaps most significant were the developments in the commercial sector.  The U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation, for example, signed an agreement on July 22 establishing a $120 million fund to encourage investment in southern Africa, and both countries agreed to expand bilateral links in many sectors ranging from air travel to communications. <P>

During this third meeting of the BNC, Mbeki tackled the thorniest item on the U.S.-South African agenda, the Armscor case.  In the 1970s and 1980s, South Africa's state-owned weapons company, Armscor, purchased arms from a Pennsylvania corporation in violation of apartheid-era sanctions and U.S. law.  In 1991, a Philadelphia court indicted Armscor.  To this day, the issue remains an irritant in the relationship.  After a meeting between Mbeki and President Clinton on July 24, the two sides reached a tentative agreement to solve the problem, easing fears that more political tension could emanate from the affair.<P>

Since Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC) government came to power over two years ago, South Africa has made progress toward creating an investor-friendly environment, reducing its budget deficit, and liberalizing exchange controls.  Foreign direct investment since 1994 has topped $4 billion, surpassing expectations, with half of that amount coming from U.S. businesses.  In addition:<P>
	
 <UL><LI>	Inflation is at 6.3 percent, the lowest rate in 20 years;
 <LI>	GDP growth of 3.5 percent is projected for 1996; and,
 <LI>	South Africa plans to reduce its budget deficit to 4 percent  	for 1997-1998 and to increase annual growth rates to 6 	percent by the turn of the century.</UL><P>

<B>The Post-Mandela Era.</B>  The international business community remains somewhat apprehensive, especially about political succession and South Africa's aggressive trade unions.  Witney Schneidman, Director of the CSIS Working Group on South and Southern Africa, contends that investors need not be jittery about the political stability after Mandela's term ends in 1999.  He points out that the next 
president will almost certainly be Mbeki, a Sussex University-trained economist with a long ANC career.  A pragmatic, strategic thinker, Mbeki was endorsed by Mandela as his successor in early July.  Although Mbeki may have less charisma than Mandela, the ANC's overwhelming popularity and Mandela's blessing will help him win the presidency and ensure a smooth transition.  More important, the institutionalization of South Africa's democracy will solidify political stability in the post-Mandela era.  <P>

<B>Cosatu, Crime, and Education.</B>  Mbeki has played an integral role in South Africa's economic reconstruction since 1994.  He was the principal author of the macroeconomic plan the government unveiled in June to reduce the fiscal deficit, create jobs, and attract foreign investment.  The plan was recently assailed, however, by the Confederation of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), the largest federation of trade unions in the country and an important ally of the ANC.  With uncharacteristic inflexibility, Mandela told Cosatu that the economic plan is non-negotiable.  "Mandela's firmness with labor," Schneidman notes, "is a welcome signal to business."  Still, the relatively high cost of labor in South Africa will deter investors from an otherwise attractive emerging market.<P>

Another potential drawback to investing in South Africa is crime.  The surge in crime in the past two yearsó20,000 murders last year aloneódoes not hinder businesses now, but Schneidman warns that if not brought under control soon, it will inevitably lead investors to ask, "Who's in charge?"   South Africa may face an even greater challenge shoring up its education system, which severely discriminated against blacks under apartheid.  Without improvement, it will be difficult to maintain a capable management force and overcome the shortage of skilled workers. <P>

In the 28 months since Mandela was inaugurated as president, South Africa has made enormous strides toward achieving sustained economic growth and becoming an attractive destination for foreign investment.  Although the devaluation of the rand over the last several months underscores the sensitivity of South Africa's markets to the concerns of international fund managers, it is not an accurate reflection of the degree of political and economic stability that exists in the country.  Given the legacy of the apartheid era, South Africa has developed a durable political center and a broad national consensus on many critical issues.  The government has also taken significant steps in transforming this consensus into a cohesive set of relevant policies.

<h1>"Re-engineering" U.S. Forces in Asia?</h1>

<h3>Tensions on Okinawa decline, 
but U.S. forces facing transition

</h3>

Although the U.S. and Japanese governments may have finally diffused the long-simmering crisis on Okinawa, the fundamental issue of U.S. military presence in Japan, and indeed throughout Asia, will inevitably resurface. Pacific Forum CSIS Senior Associate Torkel Patterson argues that the United States must begin discussions with its allies on alternative U.S. force structures in Asia now in order to secure the long-term stability of the Asia-Pacific region and America's critical role in it. "Failure to do so," Patterson warns, "will lead to the perception of an American strategic withdrawal from Asia within 5-10 years and a consequent significant rise in regional instability."<p>

Following September's summit between President Clinton and Prime Minister Hashimoto and the "2+2" meeting between the U.S. secretaries of state and defense and their Japanese counterparts, U.S.-Japan security relations seem to be back to "normal." Patterson notes that all outstanding base issues but one have been settled, and the lastórelocation of the controversial Marine Corps Air Station at Futenmaóis nearing successful resolution. Hashimoto, who faces elections this month, has bought time through his economic stimulus package for Okinawaóhis plan benefits mayors who support the U.S. bases in their towns. Governor Ota is expected to sign the action extending the base lease arrangements. <p>

<b>U.S. Interests in Asia.</b><br>
The Clinton administration remains committed to maintaining U.S. presence in the Asia-Pacific region. Its East Asia Strategy Report set the minimum number of U.S. forward-deployed forces in Asia "for the foreseeable future" at 100,000, and the administration has stalwartly defended that figure as the best way to demonstrate America's commitment to its allies. Although there is some fringe criticism of this strategy, the vast majority of policy activists regard any significant reduction of U.S. forces while tensions exist on the Korean peninsula as an irresponsible act that would send the wrong signal to North Korea.<p>

There is near uniform consensus that after the resolutionópeaceful or otherwiseóof events on the Korean peninsula, U.S. Army presence will be almost entirely withdrawn from areas west of Hawaii. Such a situation poses significant questions:<p>

<li>	What is the level of U.S. forward-deployed forces 
	that insures stability in the Asia-Pacific region? 

 <li>	At what point will the Japanese public believe the United States no longer has the will to defend them and as a consequence begin to significantly increase their defense spending? 

 <li>	What is the level and force mix below which a unified Korea might believe Japan will rearm?

 <li>	What is the minimum level of commitment below which the countries of East Asia might believe they had better make security accommodations with China rather than with the United States? 

Whether the answers to these questions include a Marine division in Okinawa is unclearóperhaps next year's Bottom Up Review, BUR 2, will provide clues. What is certain is that the core of America's continuing presence in Asia must be its air and naval forcesóthese are the equities that need to be protected over the long term. <p>

Some experts believe that events in Korea are beginning to move toward the denouement of the reunification issue, and that the process could in fact proceed rapidly. Others, such as Pacific Forum CSIS President James Kelly, believe that even a North Korea near starvation may survive for many years and continue to pose serious dangers. Both Kelly and Patterson agree that a unified Korea, awash in pride and nationalism, will urge the withdrawal of U.S. ground forcesóat which point, it would likely be too late to begin discussions on regional force structures.  The time to reevaluate U.S. military presence in Asia is nowówhile the region is relatively stable, China's military is unmodernized, and U.S. influence remains high. Intensive bilateral discussions with our allies should parallel American internal deliberations. Southeast Asian countries need to be engaged and their views listened to. China must be consulted.<p>

Former Pentagon Assistant Secretary Richard Armitage notes that governments are already beginning to recalibrate their security strategies in anticipation a waning U.S. commitment. The United States must counter thisónot by outlining specific force numbers that are indefensible over the long haul, but by initiating a strategic dialogue that demonstrates our long-term commitment.

<h1>The Changing Nature of Middle East Security</h1>
         
<h3>Enter the demographics factor . . .</h3>
 
Population growth is the ticking time bomb in the Middle East and North Africa.  Given the region's current growth rate, its governments cannot afford to rank demographics as a low priority.  <I>Anthony Cordesman, codirector of Middle East Studies at CSIS</I>, emphasizes that for the governments to succeed in social and economic reforms, they must take measures to reverse the region's present demographic trends.<P>  

The chart below indicates the severity of the current demographic trends in the Middle East/North African region.  At its present rate, the population of the region will double every 26-29 years compared with every 42 years for the world as a whole and 162 years for advanced developed nations.  
Another significant aspect of this demographic trend is the extremely young population of the region.  About 43-45% of the population is 14 years of age or younger versus 31.6% for the world and 22% for developed countries like the United States.  The region's infrastructure, already overburdened, will not be able to accommodate the growing young population.  Cordesman notes that the region's governments cannot afford to effectively educate their citizens.  If current trends continue, the situation will steadily deteriorate and educational standards will inevitably drop.<P>  

The region already suffers from major unemployment problems, and the burgeoning young population will only exacerbate them.  By World Bank definition, direct unemployment in the region is about 12%.  Youth direct unemployment is at least twice as high, and disguised 

unemployment is often 40% of young males leaving school.  Cordesman notes that many young men in the Middle East have never held a job that really contributes to their nation's productivity and have no hope of getting one. <P> 

Further Economic Decline.  "Population pressures have already made the Middle East and North Africa an ëundeveloping region,'" Cordesman adds.  The average real per capita income dropped by nearly 25% during 1980-1993, and the once "oil rich" Gulf states saw a drop of over 40% during the period because of a combination of population growth and low oil prices. Other economic problems plague the Middle East and North Africa as well.  During 1980-1991, for instance, the region experienced a nearly 3% average annual decline in real per capita GDP -- the worst decline of any region of the world.  It was also the only region that experienced a drop in productivity (6% cumulative drop) over the 30-year period 1960-1990.  (East and South Asia gained 54%, the OECD gained 48%, even Latin America gained 12%.) <P> 

<B>Solutions?</B><BR>  A strategy that focuses solely on stimulating economic growth to accommodate the surge in population is neither adequate nor feasible.  Even the governments of the most wealthy Gulf oil exporting states can no longer afford to subsidize, provide non-jobs, or offer welfare to their citizens. <P> 

Cordesman argues that governments must include demographic reforms in their economic and social programs.  "They need to reduce annual population growth rates to levels of 2% or less.  They need to restructure their educational systems in order to train their youth effectively to compete in a regional and world market.  They need to stop wasting resources on subsidized, useless state jobs and focus instead on maximizing the growth of real jobs in the private sector." <P>

<B>Implications for Regional Security.</B><BR>  The demographic boom is adversely affecting development in the region and widening the gap between rich and poor.  The situation, Cordesman warns, "is an explosive recipe for the growth of political extremism.  There will be no long-term development or security in the region if it continues to ignore demographic trends."

June 12, 1996</h4>

<h1>Turkey's Convulsion's</h1>
         
<h3>Ankara's political misfortunes continue . . .</h3>
 
Even the forces -- big business, the media, and the military establishment -- that made the initial agreement between Turkey's two main center-right parties possible after the inconclusive December elections were unable to prevent the inevitable collapse of the Motherland/True Path partnership.  On June 7, Mesut Yilmaz, the prime minister of the coalition government, resigned.  For the third time in the past nine months, Turkey's bickering political leaders find themselves incapable of establishing stability in the government.  Instead, they are scrambling to construct alignments and demonstrate their own dominance on the political scene.<P>  

The most vocal contender, once again, is Necmettin Erbakan, the leader of the Islamist Welfare Party (or Refah Party), who is currently conducting consultations to form the next government.  But Bulent Aliriza, CSIS Senior Associate in Turkish Studies, argues that the real action is taking place behind the scenes within the True Path and Motherland parties, despite Erbakan's visible attempts and the fact that Welfare holds the most seats in parliament (158 out of 550). <P> 

<B>Where to, Tansu?</B><BR>
The personal political predicament of Tansu Ciller, Turkey's prime minister between June 1993 and March 1996, continues to shape Turkish politics.  The votes cast last month in the Turkish National Assembly to investigate allegations in the so-called "Tedas" and "Tofas" cases, relating to the activities of Ciller during her tenure as prime minister, along with her personal finances, have effectively undermined her position as party leader.  Ciller retaliated against Yilmaz's exploitation of her problems by effectively scuttling the coalition. <P> 

Although True Path followed Tansu Ciller out of the coalition with Motherland, the question remains whether the party would follow her into an alternative partnership with the Welfare party.  Motherland and the two center-left parties have already indicated their unwillingness to enter into a coalition with Welfare.  True Path's position, however, is not so clear.<P>  

True Path party leaders, including Foreign Minister Emre Gonensay, oppose Ciller's stated willingness to consider a deal with Welfare.  They see it as a brazen negation of her declared secular principles to save her political skin, and have already stated that they will not serve with her should she decide to join forces with Welfare after her discussions with Erbakan scheduled for this Friday.<P>  


"It is looking more likely than ever that Ciller will begin to lose her iron grip over the True Path party," states Aliriza.  "Her previously impotent opponents may now be in a position to mount a successful challenge, especially after the disastrous showing by the True Path party in the municipal elections on June 2."  While the Welfare party polled over 34% of the vote and Motherland picked up 25%, the True Path vote was a desultory 12%.<P>

<B>Turkey's Paralysis</B><BR>
As a result of the ongoing political crisis, Ankara continues to be in a state of great uncertainty.  Important decisions relating to the economy are simply being put off.  A recent delegation from the IMF could not engage the officials they met in Ankara in serious dialogue.  The IMF team has produced an interim report on the situation in Turkey in which they warn of an imminent economic crisis.  In fact, Turkey is so preoccupied with its political crisis that even a public warning by the head of Standard and Poor's credit rating agency that Turkey's rating might soon be reduced failed to generate much interest.<P>

Turkish foreign policy is also in the doldrums.  Although Foreign Minister Gonensay was recently in Washington for talks, it is clear that Turkey will not be able to tackle its foreign policy agenda in earnest until its political crisis is resolved.<P> 

<B>In Search of a Third Candidate</B><BR>
If Welfare fails to form the next government, as Aliriza predicts, the most likely outcome will be intense pressure on both Ciller and Yilmaz that will force them to step aside and allow a third candidate to lead a coalition of True Path and Motherland successfully.  The two parties -- essentially ideological soulmates -- have been separated by the bitter personality clash between their current leaders.  Aliriza believes that the candidate best suited to fill the leadership vacuum may be former Speaker Ismet Sezgin, who was in Washington last Friday meeting with U.S. officials. <P> 

Should the current situation deteriorate to the point where new elections are unavoidable, an outright Welfare victory is likely.  The military establishment and the rest of the Turkish elite are genuinely concerned about such an outcome.  Aliriza warns that such a development would almost inevitably provoke a crisis for the regime itself.

<h1>What are CSIS values?  What does it believe?
</h1>
     
<p>The work of CSIS is based on five overriding values, which have 

been at the core of the 
Center since it was established over three decades ago:</p>
<ol type="1">

<li>The need to "strengthen America" internally in order to be 
strong internationally.  
The responsibility of the United States to exercise and sustain 
global leadership requires us 
to put our domestic house in order.

<li>The need to build leaders of character across the globe.  This 

ranges from providing 
opportunities to young student-interns at CSIS itself to assisting 

public policy leaders at the 
highest levels of government around the world.

<li>The application of private-sector creativity to the solution 
of public policy problems.


<li>A commitment to representative government, pluralistic 
societies, and open markets.

<li>A "strategic" approach.  Long-range and anticipatory thinking 
is essential to 
addressing the challenges to leaders worldwide.</ol>

<h1>Nuclear Hardball</h1>
         
<h3>Addressing nuclear safety issues in the former Soviet Union . . .</h3>
 
Ten years after the infamous Chernobyl disaster of April 26, 1986, the state of nuclear safety in the former Soviet Union can be characterized by the Lespe, a ship that has long been anchored off Murmansk on Russia's Kola Peninsula, loaded with large quantities of high-grade nuclear waste.  It is an accident waiting to happen.<P>

The sad fact, says Bob Ebel, director of the Energy and National Security Program at CSIS, is that a decade after the Chernobyl meltdown released vast amounts of radioactivity, the situation in the former Soviet Union is even more dangerous.  Fifteen Chernobyl-style reactors, without containment structures, continue to operate in Russia, Ukraine, and Lithuania.  What is more, the lack of financial resources in those states is leading to a breakdown in controls over nuclear materials and to reduced safety standards throughout the industry.  There is also the ubiquitous threat that some disgruntled nuclear employee will succeed in selling weapons-grade nuclear material to a rogue state or terrorist group.<P>

Despite all the publicity and policy attention of past 10 years, why has the situation been allowed to deteriorate?  Part of the answer is a dangerous game of nuclear hardball that Russia and Ukraine are playing with the West--and the G-7 in particular.  The next round is the G-7 meeting later this month.<P>

<I>Ukraine and the G-7</I>:  At the top of the G-7 list of priorities is the closure of the two operating reactors at the Chernobyl plant by the year 2000.  For the Ukrainian government, however, the political and social costs of replacing jobs and energy, in addition to repairing the leaking sarcophagus encasing the destroyed reactor No. 4, are prohibitive.  As a result, progress years after the disaster has been negligible. <P> 

Recognizing its leverage over the West (and assured of Western financial commitment to this effort), Ukraine has continued to raise the estimated costs for closing Chernobyl, lifting the price tag on numerous occasions to account for the creation of new jobs and the resettlement of workers as well as the loss in net profits over the lifetime of the reactor.  "Clearly, Ukraine is playing hardball with the West," notes Ebel.  
The reason is that Ukraine has its back to the wall.  To substitute for lost production, it would have to rely on natural gas or oil that it does not have.  And the Kiev government would have to weather the social impact associated with displacing the 6,000 Chernobyl employees.<P>

<I>Enter Moscow</I>:  Russia is also playing the game.  The Russian Ministry of Atomic Energy, experiencing low demand for new reactors within its own borders, is vigorously attempting to export its technology.  The West's concern is that the Russians, desperate to make profits, are indiscriminate in selling their nuclear energy technology.  This is manifest in Russia's deal with Iran--a deal that the United States unsuccessfully attempted to stop.  At present, Russia is negotiating an agreement with Cuba to finish the nuclear plant at Juragua over the next five years.<P>

Ebel warns that potential Russian deals to build reactors in China, India, North Korea, and possibly Pakistan, will inevitably result in confrontations between Moscow and Washington. <P>

<I>Policy Options</I>: In its most recent report, the CSIS Congressional Study Group on Nuclear Energy Safety Challenges in the Former Soviet Union determined that the traditional approach taken by the West in dealing with nuclear safety issues has been unsuccessful.  The Group recommends that the G-7 take a more active leadership role in the financing of the rescue efforts because the primary cause of the deteriorating safety is attributable to lack of funds for maintenance and safety upgrades.<P> 
<B>
Four Recommended Approaches to Financing:</B>
 	<UL>
<LI>Add surcharges to the monthly electricity bills of consumers in the EU and G-7 countries;

<LI> 	Use the Russian stockpile of refined uranium as a guarantor for loans;

<LI> 	Construct compensating generating capacities by Western companies on a "build-operate-transfer" basis; and

<LI> 	At the direction of the G-7, let the World Bank finance efforts such as electricity-generating projects that would allow the phaseout of the most 
antiquated power plants. </UL> 

Although the West currently lacks the political will to finance the effort to upgrade and eventually shut down all unsafe nuclear reactors in the former Soviet Union, the alternatives--ignoring the dangers or expecting the local governments to rectify them without help--are not feasible.<P>

Surely, says Ebel, it is not too costly for the citizens of the more industrially developed nations to pay a monthly surcharge equivalent to the price of two beers to ensure the safety of future generations.  What will it take for the West to realize the severity and urgency of the problem?  Perhaps another Chernobyl?  If the West does nothing to improve the safety of the plants in the former Soviet Union, the chances of another Chernobyl in this decade are quite good.  In fact, some experts place the odds at one in six.  Accidents, like the Lespe, are waiting to happen.

<h1>Debate in New Delhi</h1>
         
<h3>Will the United Front pursue economic reform?</h3>

 Before the May elections in India, the government of P.V. Narasimha Rao had undertaken economic liberalization that caught the attention of observers across the world. The fiscal and monetary reform pulled India back from the brink of a financial collaps
e in 1991 and moved the country toward a free-market economy.  The results were impressive.  In five years, annual foreign direct investment levels surged from $68 million to $2 billion, foreign portfolio investment increased, foreign reserves skyrocketed
 from $1 billion to $17.5 billion, and real GDP growth climbed from less than 1 percent to an unprecedented 6.2 percent last year.  Then Rao and his Congress party were handed the worst defeat in the party's history.  The key question now is whether econo
mic liberalization in India left with the Rao government.  The answer, says Ambassador William Clark, former U.S. ambassador to India and currently CSIS senior adviser on Asia, is a qualified no: the coalition government will not reverse reforms, but the 
process will move more slowly.<P>

<B>Whither Reform?</B><BR>
The fate of liberalization is in the hands of the coalition of 14 disparate regional, caste-based, and socialist parties that now rules India.  This United Front government, headed by Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda from the southern state of Karnataka, sm
oothly passed the parliamentary vote of confidence on June 12.  It was supported, but not joined, by the Congress party, which holds command of 141 seats in parliament despite its electoral losses.<P>

The ascendance of a left-leaning coalition initially caused business leaders to fear that the new government would turn back reform.  H.D. Gowda's selection of P. Chidambaram, a past architect of the Congress reform program, as finance minister largely al
leviated those fears.  Yet although it does not appear ready to undo reforms, the new government may not be able to take them to the next level.  A recently ratified Common Approach Minimum Program makes promises with contradictory implications.  On the o
ne hand, it calls for

 <UL><LI>a GDP growth rate of 7 percent annually over the next decade, up from 6.2 percent last year;

 	<LI>an increase in foreign direct investment from a record $2 billion last year to $10 billion in the coming year; and

 	<LI>a reduction of the public debt to less than 4 percent of GDP, down from 5.9 percent last year.</UL>




Yet, on the other hand, the United Front plans to encourage foreign investment only in the high-priority areas of infrastructure and technology, not in consumer goods.  In
addition, the government will limit privatization of state sectors and do little to reform the exit policy, which would make it easier to hire and fire public sector employees.  The prior Congress government also avoided these sensitive areas.  And the Un
ited Front, with its many lower-caste and poorer constituents, promises to spend more on anti-poverty measures, rural and social infrastructure, and education -- despite the fact that interest payments on public debt already consume about 45 percent of th
e central government's revenue.<P>

The government's budget, to be unveiled in late July, will spell out exactly how the United Front intends to resolve these contradictions.  On Monday, June 17, Finance Minister Chidambaram announced large government spending cuts geared toward curbing the
 fiscal deficit, including a cap on government hiring.  After leftist coalition parties threatened to withdraw their support, Chidambaram reassured them that current employees would not lose their jobs or see their wages frozen.<P>

Meanwhile, pressures from the regional parties that constitute one-third of the coalition may force the United Front government to increase spending on the state level, for example, by bailing out the nearly bankrupt southern state of Andhra Pradesh.  At 
the same time, Ambassador Clark believes that there may be advantages in India's move toward a more federal system: the devolution of authority envisioned, including the decentralization of administrative, political, and economic powers, should give state
s greater ability to raise revenue and compete for foreign investment.<P>

<B>High-Wire Act in New Delhi</B><BR>
Not only do the divergent interests and personalities among its members threaten to fracture the United Front, but the power held by Rao, who still heads the Congress party, can also make life difficult for Gowda.  Rao still commands enough seats to make 
political demands on the United Front; the opposition has already accused Gowda of soft-peddling corruption charges against Rao in order to retain Congress support.  With Congress at its back, and the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party waiting in the wings
 for another chance at power, the United Front faces a tricky political balancing act in the coming months.

<h3><a name="aids">Global HIV/AIDS: A Strategy for U.S. Leadership</a></h3>
<b>A Consensus Report of the CSIS Working Group on Global HIV/AIDS</b><p>

As the world becomes increasingly interconnected through trade and commerce, infectious diseases pose threats that spread beyond national borders.  Without a "magic cure" in sight, action is needed to prevent the spread of the deadly HIV/AIDS virus.  This study outlines a broad agenda for policymakers, public health officials, and leaders of nongovernmental organizations.  The message is clear: deterring the spread of the pandemic is a global challenge, requiring a global strategic response.  As a world leader, the United States has a clear strategic interest in committing itself to this effort.<p>

<body bgcolor=#ffffff>

<h1>How does CSIS implement this vision?
</h1>

    CSIS achieves this mission in three ways:
<UL>

<LI>      <b>By Generating Strategic Analysis:</b>  CSIS is
<i>a source of scholarly analysis
</i> on international public policy issues.  On the one hand, it 
covers the world with 
real-time assessments.  On the other, it provides long-term 
analysis based on understanding of 
underlying forces and trends, utilizing alternative scenarios to 
reflect various contingencies. 
 This dual approach both guides the immediate policymaking process 

and alerts decision-makers 
to future policy challenges and options.<BR><BR>

<LI>       <b>By Convening Policymakers and other Influential 
Parties:</b>  CSIS has a 
longstanding reputation for bringing together 
<i>the right people on the right issues, breaking 
stalemates, and pushing debate forward </i>in a non-partisan 
environment.  It attracts leaders 
from government, the private sector, and academia from around the 
world.<BR><BR>

<LI>        <b>By Building Structures for Policy Action:</b>  CSIS
<i>mobilizes government and private-sector leaders in action 
commissions and other high-level groups, and then moves 
relevant policymakers to take concrete action.</i>  These 
initiatives are designed to achieve 
specific, well-defined results--such as replacing the current 
anti-savings, anti-investment tax 
code in the United States, or increasing foreign investment flows 
to economies in transition. 
</ul>

<p>Specifically, CSIS action commissions and other high-level 
groups have been formed in Poland, 
St. Petersburg, Ukraine, the South American Southern Cone, 
Singapore, and Turkey to explore 
concrete ways of expanding economic, financial, and political ties 

with the United States.  At 
home, CSIS has had an important policy impact on fiscal, tax, 
health care, and capital market 
reform as a result of its Strengthening of American Commission and 

its follow-up effort, The 
National 
Campaign to Strengthen America.</p>

November 4, 1996</b><hr>

<h1>General Elections in Japan</h1>

<h3>Reading between the lines . . . 
</h3>

What do the results of the October 20 general election in Japan signify?  For the third consecutive year, voter turnout was at a record low (59%), reflecting deep popular dissatisfaction with the recent pattern of coalition politics and voter disenchantment with the newer reform parties.  Those who did vote reverted to supporting the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) expanding the position of the LDP by 28 seats, from 211 to 239.  On the other hand, the New Frontier Party challenge to the LDP backfired, leaving the party with four fewer seats than before.  The LDP, however, is still short of an absolute majority in the 500-seat Diet and is now struggling to form another coalition.<p>

<b>More of the same?</b>  Yes and no.  Yes, the election was indeed a vote for the status quo (the LDP), according to CSIS Japan Chairholder William Breer.  And yes, the majority of voters continued to support moderate conservative politicians.  But there are key differences that deserve attention, says Breer:<p>

 <li>	First, the elections represent continuity.  It is highly likely that Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto will be reappointed on November 7.  That in itself is significant because it will be the first time in three years that a prime minister has served for more than a few months.  This has important implications for a range of issues important to the United States, including foreign affairs and defense policies.<p>

 <li>	Second, the election took place in the context of more general political change that marked a turning point in the Japanese electoral system.  The new electoral system, which combines a "winner-take-all," single seat contest with proportional representation in the Diet, is aimed at discouraging lavish campaigns and internal party conflicts.  Although the new system did not push Japanese politics as far toward an American two-party structure as some observers had hoped, it succeeded in producing increased representation for Japan's urban population.<p>

 <li>	Third, freed of the factional ties that cemented relationships in the past, we are likely to see a more fluid situation in the future while politicians sort themselves out more along party lines. </ul><p>

<b>Impact on administrative reform?</b>  Although virtually every party highlighted the need for administrative reform during the campaign, the election results do not reveal a public mandate to peel the layers of the Japanese bureaucratic onion.  Breer maintains that world economic conditionsónot Japanese politicsóare the key factor driving economic and administrative reform and deregulation.  To respond to those changing world conditions, however, politicians will ultimately need to wrest control of decision-making from the powerful bureaucracy.  <p>

<b>Implications for U.S.-Japan relations:</b>   The elections also signify a "steady-as-she-goes" position in relations with the United States.  Despite the potential for continued friction over trade issues, Breer asserts that prospects for favorable U.S.-Japan cooperation on a number of issues are good.  The goodwill on both sides, coupled with the personal relations that have developed between U.S. and Japanese leaders, suggests that the two countries will be able to build on the summit discussions held last April on their security relationship and security contingencies in East Asia.

<h3><a name="phalanx">Breaking the Phalanx: A New Design for Landpower in the 21st Century</a></h3>
Douglas A. Macgregor<br>
Foreword by Donald Kagan<p>
This work proposes nothing less than the reorganization of America's ground forces on  strategic, operational, and tactical levels. Central to the proposal is the simple thesis that the U.S. Army must take control of its future by exploiting the emerging revolution in military affairs. The analysis argues that a new Army warfighting organization will not only be more deployable and effective in joint operations; reorganized information-age ground forces will be significantly less expensive to operate, maintain, and modernize than the Army's current Cold War division-based organization. It is not enough to rely on an infusion of new, expensive technology into the U.S. defense establishment to preserve U.S. strategic dominance in the next century; the United States must reform and reorganize its ground forces at all levels to meet the demands of the information age.<p>

Based on the work of a December 1994 conference in Washington, D.C., this report examines the potential for a "train wreck" in defense: the endangering of future U.S. capabilities by the current overcommitment of U.S. military forces and by the failure to provide a strategy for reshaping the military to meet future requirements. The authors examine the short- and long-term options facing defense planners and propose alternatives for the future.<p>

Society is facing an entirely new challenge that cuts across national security, economic security, law enforcement, intelligence, and corporate security_global organized crime. This CSIS report has identified some of the dimensions of the problem: information superhighway vulnerability, counterfeiting of tender and credit cards, money laundering, trade in fissionable materials, drug trafficking and terrorism, Russian organized crime, and international gang activity. Unless we understand the nature and scope of today's problems, we cannot begin to counteract them.<p>

This companion volume to The Information Revolution and National Security brings together a diverse set of experts from the business, military, government, and academic communities to consider the implications of new information technologies for international security. The focus is not so much on security in the strict military sense as it is on the global social, economic, and political changes occurring because of new information technologies and their potential effects on the international security environment_for example, the effects of speed and global networks on the conduct of diplomacy as well as conflict.  This provocative, informed exploration will be of interest to policymakers, legislators, and others involved with the global security issues accompanying this revolution.<p>

Information and communications technologies are having a profound impact in a number of ways, domestically and globally, including how national security is maintained and how war is waged. There are also implications for civil liberties and how we, as a society, deal with new kinds of conflict. The issues that are raised are both far-ranging and complex.<p>

The United States is vulnerable to information warfare attacks and operations.  The capability to deny, disrupt, destroy, or steal information and systems is widely available and low in cost.  A dedicated adversary could seriously jeopardize our national and economic security as our dependence on information infrastructures continues to grow exponentially.  Composed of senior U.S. government officials and private-sector experts, the task force identifies the most critical infrastructures, assesses the threats to and vulnerabilities of these infrastructures, and makes recommendations on how best to mitigate the risks.<p>

<h3><a name="virtualnuke">Nuclear Weapons in a Transformed World: The Challenge of Virtual Arsenals</a></h3>
<a href="http://www.csis.org/html/4mazarr.html">Michael J. Mazarr</a>, editor<p>
This edited volume brings together more than a dozen of the world's most prominent arms control experts to assess a bold emerging concept in nuclear arms control:  virtual nuclear arsenals (VNAs).  In recent years, many respected U.S. former officials and academics have suggested that the United States would be safer in a post-Cold War world of far fewer or no nuclear weapons.  This concept tests the feasibility of such radical nuclear end-states by examining whether the dismantling of nuclear weapons and retention of their components, rather than full disarmament as traditionally understood, would achieve many of the advantages of a zero-nuclear-weapon world while avoiding some of its pitfalls.  Contributors offer a variety of answers to that question, some skeptical and some encouraging.  By promoting a detailed analysis of a specific policy option, this volume constitutes perhaps the most rigorous discussion of nuclear abolition yet published.<p>

Highlighted by the views of Mitsubishi CEO Ben Makihara and former assistant secretary of defense Carl Ford, this book examines the security challenges facing the world (notably the growing saliency of China and the volatile Korean peninsula) and the role the U.S.-Japan security relationship might play in confronting them. The alliance pressures caused by economic disputes, Japan's unique prohibition on collective self-defense, and the significant U.S. base presence in Japan are explored by an expert group with first-hand, real-world experience in managing this vital security relationship.<p>

Russian organized crime constitutes a direct threat to the national security interests of the United States by fostering instability in a nuclear-armed power.  Left unchecked, Russia is in jeopardy of becoming a criminal syndicalist state under the control of corrupt government bureaucrats, politicians, quasi-businessmen, and criminals.  Composed of senior-level U.S. government representatives and private-sector experts, the task force assesses the breadth and depth of Russian organized crime and corruption, addresses current U.S. policy, and makes recommendations on how  best to confront these challenges.<p>

The Forum was established in 1993 by CSIS, the Japan Institute of International Affairs, and the Russian Institute of World Economy and International Relations to foster candid discussion of regional and international security issues among private experts and policymakers. The Forum sessions have served to advance understanding of national perspectives on a variety of proposals to improve mutual confidence_particularly in the realms of military transparency and enhanced contacts. This report expresses the joint conviction that a trilateral framework can improve bilateral relations among the three nations and promote broader stability.<p>

<h3><a name="ukraine">Ukrainian Security Policy</a></h3>
Taras Kuzio<p>
The economic crisis and mismanagement that engulfed Ukraine during 1993-1994 led many in the West and among Ukraine's neighbors to question the country's long-term viability as an independent state. Yet in 1995, Ukraine entered a new era reflecting its importance as a linchpin of regional security and stability in Europe. This study discusses Ukrainian security policies and their implications for Western policy. It makes a compelling case for greater Western aid and political support for Ukrainian independence and territorial integrity.<p>

The relationship between the U.S. military and civil society is undergoing rapid changes_the military because of its altered role and rapid downsizing; society because of the cumulative effects of changes in individual values, in familial structures, and in political priorities for the use of resources, including military power.  Leading academics, military professionals, and policy analysts address the traditional approaches and emphasize the need to develop new concepts.<p>

This volume offers fresh thinking about the proliferation subject and the changing policy agenda.  It describes the changing nature of the problem in the 1990s, discusses new trends in nonproliferation and counterproliferation policy, identifies new arms control challenges at the regional and global levels, and concludes with a discussion of the global politics of proliferation.<p>

<h3><a name="centasia">Central Asia since Independence</a></h3>
<a href="http://www.csis.org/html/4hunter.html">Shireen T. Hunter</a><p>
Like all other post-Soviet societies, after becoming independent the Central Asian countries have faced a host of problems and challenges related to the process of nation building. These challenges have ranged from the need to find an alternative value system to the reinvigoration and reform of their badly sagging economies. To these challenges must be added that of forging new relations among themselves, with their immediate neighbors, and with the rest of the world.<p>

<a href="http://www.csis.org/html/4ebel.html">Robert E. Ebel</a><p>
Of  the 14 republics that make up the "Near Abroad," only three_Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Azerbaijan_are rich in oil and natural gas. The others have been almost completely dependent on Russia for their fuel. Russia, with its own energy sector in difficulty, has been cutting back deliveries. The republics with substantial oil and gas resources are challenged to develop them in a timely and responsible fashion. Success will move them into the world of developed nations; failure will bring economic stagnation and political grief. <p>

Fifteen nuclear reactors of the type that exploded at Chernobyl in April 1986 are still operating in Russia, Ukraine, and Lithuania.  The West, concerned about safety of operations, wants these reactors shut down, but the host nations refuse. The electricity these reactors supply is much too important for their economies, so the argument goes. The report defines policy options and procedures to implement those options for the acceptable resolution of the nuclear power safety issues facing the former Soviet Union.<p>

What kind of state Russia is to become ultimately depends on its policies toward the "near abroad."

Russian organized crime constitutes a direct threat to the national security interests of the United States by fostering instability in a nuclear-armed power.  Left unchecked, Russia is in jeopardy of becoming a criminal syndicalist state under the control of corrupt government bureaucrats, politicians, quasi-businessmen, and criminals.  Composed of senior-level U.S. government representatives and private-sector experts, the task force assesses the breadth and depth of Russian organized crime and corruption, addresses current U.S. policy, and makes recommendations on how  best to confront these challenges.<p>

Taras Kuzio<p>
The economic crisis and mismanagement that engulfed Ukraine during 1993-1994 led many in the West and among Ukraine's neighbors to question the country's long-term viability as an independent state. Yet in 1995, Ukraine entered a new era reflecting its importance as a linchpin of regional security and stability in Europe. This study discusses Ukrainian security policies and their implications for Western policy. It makes a compelling case for greater Western aid and political support for Ukrainian independence and territorial integrity.<p>

<h1>Nuclear Weapons Testing</h1>

<h3>Will a comprehensive test
ban stop proliferation?
</h3>

An end to nuclear weapons testing?  Don't count on itóat least not in the near future.  The recent breakdown of negotiations on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), triggered by a veto from India, represents an enormous setback to more than two and a half years of talks at the United Nations Conference on Disarmament.  More fundamentally, the breakdown raises profound questions about whether a ban on testing will prevent further nuclear proliferation.<P>

<B>The Dimension from New Delhi.</B><BR>
  India has straight-forward reasons for objecting to the proposed agreement.  From India's standpoint, it allows the five declared nuclear states (P-5)óthe United States, Russia, China, France, and Britainóto continue developing and expanding their arsenals through advanced computer simulations in lieu of actual nuclear testing.  New Delhi has demanded a timetable for the elimination of existing nuclear weapons, a proposal rejected by the five nuclear powers and by a majority of the countries at the conference.  India's ambassador to the Conference on Disarmament, Arundhati Ghose, maintains that as long as the CTBT ignores the question of disarmament, the treaty is little more than a tool of the P-5 to further widen the gap between nuclear-weapon haves and have-nots. <P> 

New Delhi also objects to the "entry in force" provision that requires that the P-5 states, along with Israel, Pakistan, and Indiaóthe three threshold statesósign and ratify the treaty before it can take effect.  It claims that the provision impinges on its sovereignty and could subject it to punitive measures from the international community should it elect not to ratify the treaty when the UN General Assembly meets in October.<P>

Furthermore, the treaty does not provide security guarantees to India in return for forfeiting its nuclear option.  New Delhi has repeatedly expressed its regional security concerns vis-‡-vis China, Pakistan, and Russia. Thus far in the negotiations, however, no nuclear state has made such assurances to India.  It is highly unlikely that any will. <P>

<B>Cold War Relic or Useful Tool?</B><BR>
  In light of the breakdown in the test ban negotiations, it is time to ask whether efforts to eliminate testing still have any utility.  On this question, reactions by CSIS experts are mixed:<P>

   	According to Stephen Cambone, CSIS senior fellow in Political-Military Studies, the CTBT is an "anachronism."  He asserts that a ban on testing is a product of the perspective born in the 1940s, when bans were regarded as a way to halt the arms race and to marginalize the importance of nuclear weapons.  "Whatever value it had in that context," Cambone argues, "is much reduced in an era when proliferation is fueled by rapidly changing geopolitical circumstances, not vertical arms racing; a CTBT does not pose an insuperable obstacle to the development or acquisition of nuclear weapons."<P>

	Cambone views India's reluctance to sign the CTBT as an opportunity for the international community to consider whether the approach to nuclear safety and security, arms control, and disarmament on which the treaty rests is adequate given the realities of the post-Cold War strategic environment:  "If marginalizing nuclear weapons globally remains the aim of the West, then the CTBT may not be the right vehicle for accomplishing that goal."<P>

  	Mike Mazarr, director of the CSIS New Millennium Project, disagrees both with India's objections and with the idea that the CTBT is the relic of another era.  "The treaty is a major step toward India's avowed goal of disarmament; pressing for the complete goal at an early date," Mazarr contends, "is so unrealistic as to be disingenuous."  And, Mazarr notes, the entry-into-force provision is a common feature of treaties whose effect depends on the adherence of a specific group of states. <P>

	Mazarr also argues that the CTBT itself is more important than ever as a centerpiece of the effort to marginalize nuclear weapons in world politicsóa goal now championed in the United States by people from both sides of the political spectrum, including dozens of former high-ranking defense officials and military officers.<P>

William Clark, Jr., CSIS adviser on Asia and former U.S. ambassador to India, sees the current breakdown in the CTBT negotiations this way: "Although there is a certain logic and legitimacy to some of India's complaints, many other countries could certainly object on the basis of the same issues.  It is a shame to see India impeding the processóand potentially sinking itóbased on a certain set of concerns that other countries rightly could claim but have not."

<h3><a name="nafta3">NAFTA at Three</a>: A Progress Report</h3>
<a href="http://www.csis.org/html/4weintra.html">Sidney Weintraub</a><p>
The North American Free Trade Agreement, now completing its third year of operations, was the most controversial trade agreement entered into by the United States since World War II.  It was sold by its supporters and condemned by its opponents with unusual hyperbole about how many jobs it would create (or sacrifice) and how valuable (or injurious) it would be for many U.S. industries.  The controversy picked up again in early 1995 when the United States mounted a $20 billion rescue of the Mexican peso, to which additional funds were provided by the International Monetary Fund.  To get at the complete picture, the author analyzes the actual performance of NAFTA.  He sets forth the main criteria by which the agreement should be assessed: Has it led to an increase in trade? Has it benefited both Mexico and the United States (plus Canada)? Did the agreement cause Mexico's economic crisis in 1995?  Did it help Mexico resolve that crisis?  He also notes that, contrary to the fears about general job loss,  the U.S. economy has been operating at full employment since NAFTA came into effect.  His main conclusion: NAFTA has performed well under difficult circumstances.<p>

<h3><a name="house">Putting America's House in Order: The Nation as a Family</a></h3>
<a href="http://www.csis.org/html/4abshire.html">David Abshire</a> and Brock Brower<p>
This book is a call to action for the leaders of this generation to endow their heirs with the kinds of values, prospects, and prosperity that has sustained the American family, personally and nationally, for 200 years. The authors' proposals are specific. They range from ways to reach a zero deficit budget to substituting a tax code that favors savings, investment, and growth. They also delineate the elements of leadership --local, state, and national -- that are necessary to meet the United States' greatest challenge since the winning of the cold war.<p>

"What most deeply moves David Abshire and Brock Brower is the rising commitment of ordinary Americans to a bipartisan course of action to end deficit profligacy and keep our country headed round toward economic growth that will bring real prosperity for all American families." - Warren B. Rudman, cochairman, Concord Coalition and former U.S. Senator<p>

"For the sake of our future, I earnestly hope that this eloquent plea and plan for the reconciliation of our national community will be read by as many Americans as possible. As a people, we desperately need to take action to implement the authors' common sense solutions to the underlying structural problems of our society." - David L. Boren, President, University of Oklahoma and former U.S. Senator<p>

<h3><a name="rediscover">The Rediscovery of America: The Story of the Free Trade Agreement</a></h3>
Hermann von Bertrab<p>
Rarely before in the history of the Western Hemisphere has such monumental change occurred, as the United States, Mexico, and Canada have integrated their economies and united their destinies under the NAFTA agreement.  Three countries that had isolated themselves during the last few centuries have rediscovered their common roots and interests under this modern treaty.  This insightful book, written by the chief Mexican representative for NAFTA in the U.S., offers an insider's perspective on the dramatic and arduous process of how NAFTA became a reality.<p>

Foreword by Robert A. Scalapino<br>
Contributors: Chen Dezhao, Jane Khanna, J.A. Miller, Robert S. Ross, Sally Stewart, Sung Yun-wing, Milton D. Yeh<p>
The emergence of subregional economies_"natural economic territories"_raises serious questions about nation-state sovereignty.  In this examination of the subregional economy made up of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and China's southern provinces, the authors seek to capture points of rift and accord at the governmental and provincial levels even as economic flows seem to be outpacing the central governments' abilities to manage them.<p>

The five multilateral development banks (MDBs) were designed to operate in a far different environment than the one that prevails today with the end of the Cold War and explosion of private-sector financial flows to emerging markets. The broad-based CSIS Task Force looked at criticisms of the banks' operations and the extent to which the institutions responded. It provides extensive recommendations for refocusing MDB priorities and reforming their operating practices.<p>

February 16, 1996</h4>

<h1>Running on Empty</h1>
         
<h3>North Korea struggles to survive . . .</h3>
 
Mounting food shortages, increasing defections to the South, political factionalism among its leadership, and recent military maneuvers along the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) all suggest that North Korea (DPRK) is edging closer to the brink of collapse.  The situation is becoming more dangerous by the day.<P>

Pyongyang took an unprecedented step earlier this fall when it broke with its traditional juche ("self-reliance") system and asked the international community for assistance in overcoming food shortages.  Analysts have been tempted to proclaim this "opening" as a sign that North Korea is ready, out of necessity, to join the international community.  Not so, says <I>Bill Taylor, CSIS Director of Political Military Studies</I> and an expert on North Korea.  Rather, it is a North Korean tactic to rectify its steadily worsening domestic situation by attracting international aid.  The DPRK is attempting to accomplish its goals with a minimal amount of foreign influence, while simultaneously working to cut South Korea out of the action. <P> 
	
For the North Korean leadership, there is only one concern of importance: ensuring that the military, upon which the North Korean leadership relies as the cornerstone of its power, is kept well armed and well fed.  All informed estimates conclude that the North Korean military gets all it needs, even while the North Korean people go hungry.<P>  

North Korea has also been hit by increasingly high-level defections across its closed borders.  In the last two weeks, several prominent diplomats have applied for asylum to South Korea.  On Wednesday, a North Korean security agent shot and killed three DPRK agents in an attempt to find political asylum in the Russian embassy in Pyongyang.  While the effect this chain of events has on the North's leadership structure is unknown, it affirms that economic, social, and political conditions in North Korea are deteriorating rapidly. <P> 	




Political factionalism in the North Korean leadership ranks also is becoming more apparent.  The appeals for food aid this fall were widely seen as a symbol of increasing influence on the part of "moderates" in the North Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Last week, however, North Korean officials ordered that no further international food aid be requested.  Surprisingly, an unusually candid statement attributed to North Korea's U.N. ambassador Pak Gil Yon was that "the Pyongyang government would not ask for more food aid because of strong opposition from the military."  As opaque as the political situation in North Korea remains, it is clear that the military has the upper hand in all aspects of crucial decision-making processes. <P>  

Taylor is concerned that Pyongyang will try to divert the attention of the North Korean people away from their domestic plight by using propaganda to exaggerate the threat from the South, thereby creating a "state of siege" mentality.  They may also intend to take advantage of the ongoing political turmoil in South Korea. <P> 

Over the past two months, the North, which long has had about two-thirds of its military force forward-deployed near the DMZ, reportedly has moved another 120 fighter aircraft and a flight of bombers to three airfields along the DMZ -- only a five-minute flight from Seoul.  Apprehensive of the provocative situation in the North, Seoul has placed its forces on a higher state of alert. <P> 

The stakes are high for all the countries involved in the Korean peninsula.  With 60,000 Americans in South Korea, including 37,000 troops, the United States must work to ensure that the rhetoric does not spiral out of control.  It is at times of high tension that wars start by accident or miscalculation.  <I>CSIS Political Military Studies analyst Andrew Kelly</I> notes that tensions on the Peninsula are higher now than at any other point since the end of the Cold War.  Extreme caution must be exercised by the United States and South Korea as events unfold in the DPRK.

<font size="5"><b>L</b></font>aying the foundation for economic growth and prosperity in the face of profound demographic changes that will occur early in the next century is perhaps the most difficult challenge facing the nation.  The imminent retirement of the Baby Boom generation, combined with longer life expectancies, will place extraordinary fiscal pressure on federal entitlement programs and could imperil the standard of living for future generations.  Unless we save more and spend less, the nation will be confronted with a Hobson's choice - dramatically lower benefits for future retirees or an untenable tax burden on the next generation of Americans.<p>

The National Commission on Retirement Policy is being established to respond to this challenge.  The objectives of the Commission are three-fold:<p>

 <ul>
<li>	To educate the American public about the scope and magnitude of the retirement financing challenge;

 <li>	To provide the foundation for non-partisan and informed policy debate; and

 <li>	To build a national consensus for the changes necessary to place the nation on a sound long-term fiscal footing and ensure a secure retirement for all Americans.</ul><p>

To carry out these objectives, the Commission will expand public awareness on these issues by sponsoring conferences, roundtable discussions, and town hall meetings around the country.  Further, the Commission will launch an aggressive media outreach campaign.  It also will gather the best available analysis and evidence from economists, academicians, and retirement policy experts, with a view to crafting practical, achievable policy recommendations to be published in a final report to be released in mid-1998.  Finally, the Commission will bring together policymakers and affected constituencies to develop a consensus for implementing these recommendations, including the introduction of appropriate legislation by the Congressional co-chairmen.

RE:	Enterprise for the Environment Update </b><p>

	I am pleased to report that we had a very productive and lively third Steering Committee meeting and second Plenary Session on October 2-3.  There has been considerable progress made in each of the four Action Groups,  in the NAPA case study selection process, and in the International Perspectives Project.  Before I summarize this progress, I'd like to address the importance of outreach in this project. <p> 
 
	A strong outreach and communications effort is essential to the success of the Enterprise for the Environment.  Project updates such as this one are one important element of our effort.  If you encounter additional persons who would like to receive them, please encourage them to pass on their rolodex information (including e-mail addresses) to Mike Farrar or James O'Brien at the Center for Strategic & International Studies (202/775-3267 phone; 202/467-0357 fax; Internet: <a href="mailto: mcf@csis.org">mcf@csis.org</a>).<p> 

<b>ACTION GROUP PROGRESS</b><br>   

	Action  Group 1 has adopted a three part agenda.  The group is looking at:<p>
<ul><li>1) designing and implementing  a goal-based decision-making process within EPA; 
<li>2) improving resource allocation consistent with these goals; and
<li>3) using environmental indicators as mechanisms for measuring the performance of the environmental management system.</ul>

At this stage, the stakeholders are focusing on the effectiveness of the current goal-setting process and developing options for improvements to the current system.<p>

	Action Group 2  is addressing standard-setting by developing a "Framework for Environmental Decision-Making."  This framework articulates four types of objectives for managing environmental problems, including:  Baseline Protections, Aspirational Goals,  Milestones to Reach Aspirational Goals, and Maintenance of Quality Environments.  The Action Group is deliberating on the criteria to be used for defining and achieving these objectives, including the role of cost, risk, equity and enforceability and the process for establishing and periodically reviewing these objectives.<p>

	Action Group 3 is exploring internal corporate decision-making in order to identify the  internal and external incentives/disincentives for companies to enhance environmental performance.  One  tool that the Action Group is considering is auditing, specifically, how to encourage small and medium businesses to audit, how to design sector-specific audits for such businesses and how to incorporate beyond compliance elements into audits.  The group will also build on recent work by the Aspen Institute and others in exploring "alternative compliance"/alternative pathways to boost environmental performance while increasing flexibility.  Finally, the Action Group is identifying the ways in which regulations may create barriers to enhanced performance and how to structure a regulatory system to encourage enhanced environmental  performance. <p>

	Action Group 4 is looking at incentives for environmental performance which are generally outside of EPA's purview, including: economic incentives, trade policies and the effect of information  on capital markets.  The group will also explore broader information issues concerning  how environmental information is gathered, analyzed, and released.<p> 

<b>NAPA CASE STUDIES AND INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE PROJECT</b><br> 

	The expert panel convened by the National Academy of Public Administration has made three initial selections of case studies of innovation in environmental protection.  These case studies are a key part of NAPA's analytic support to the Enterprise for the Environment.  The case studies are: 
1)  EPA's Performance Partnership Agreement with New Jersey; 2) community-based environmental management in the Clarks Fork River watershed; and 3) early results of Project XL as reflected in the Intel's Arizona Plant proposal.  The NAPA panel will select three additional case studies later in November.  These case studies will provide valuable input to the work of the Action Groups.   Additional input is being provided in a series of roundtable discussions at CSIS conducted by the International Perspectives Project.  These discussions have brought together experts in policy innovations occurring in other countries.<p>

<b>NEXT STEPS </b><br>
	Much work lies ahead for the Steering Committee and the Action Groups.  November and December will be very busy months.  The next Plenary Session is scheduled for late January.  We are aiming to meet our timeline calling for completion of the project in April 1997.  I'm happy to note that the Mott Foundation and the Surdna Foundation recently awarded grants to the Enterprise for the Environment, recognizing the importance of the work we have undertaken. Thank you for your interest in this effort. <p>

RE:	Project Update and Next Steps III</b><p>


	This is the third in a series of updates on the Enterprise for the Environment that I will send regularly to all stakeholders describing the status of the project and next steps.<p>

	The second Steering Committee meeting of the Enterprise for the Environment took place on June 20.  It was a successful and productive meeting.  Attached are the minutes of the meeting which include a short summary for your convenience.<p>

	The meeting produced guidance on draft workplans for the Action Groups that had been prepared by the Group co-chairs and the project staff.  The next step is to convene the Action Groups and begin their work.<p>

	The Keystone Center, working with CSIS and the Action Group co-chairs, has completed the assignment of various stakeholders to Action Groups.  We were not able to assign all stakeholders to the Action Groups for which they expressed their highest preferences; however, we made every effort to satisfy as many preferences as possible.  Keystone facilitators are in the process of contacting you and your staff to notify you of the first Action Group meetings later this month.  Keystone is also recruiting a few select additional stakeholders to ensure that each Action Group has appropriate balance.<p>

	I look forward to seeing you at our next Plenary Session on October 2-3, and I am confident that the Action Groups will make substantial progress in the weeks ahead.	To ensure that all stakeholders have the correct dates on their calendars, I have attached the current schedule of future Plenary Sessions.<p>

	Thank you again for your support of the Enterprise for the Environment, and for the commitment of your personal time and attention.  With many of our organizational and membership issues resolved, we can turn to the challenging substantive work before us.<p>

<b><a name="2">DATE:  June 10, 1996</a><br>
TO:	Stakeholders in the Enterprise for the Environment<br>
FROM:	William Ruckelshaus, Chairman<br>
RE:	Project Update and Next Steps II</b><p>


	This is the second in a series of updates on the Enterprise for the Environment that I will send regularly to all stakeholders describing the status of the project and next steps.<p>

	First, I would like to share with you some additional thoughts about certain fundamentals related to the project.  These thoughts are spurred in part from the discussions at the first Plenary Session and in part from subsequent conversations I have had with various members and project staff.  <p>

	Critical to the success of the Enterprise for the Environment is creating balance in its principles, goals, membership, and leadership.  The underlying principle of the project has a dual character.  "Cleaner, cheaper" is not a slogan -- it is truly a guiding principle.  Our environmental management systems (both public and private) must evolve in ways that produce higher levels of environmental protection and that promote more flexible, performance-based, cost-effective approaches to reaching these levels.  This is the vision set forth in the recent report of the President's Council on Sustainable Development, and it is the vision that guides the Enterprise for the Environment.  The most recent Project Summary captures this principle well, as it relates to the goal of developing recommendations in three areas: 1) transformation of EPA's environmental management system, with particular emphasis on its statutory base; 2) mechanisms that promote higher levels of responsibility, accountability, commitment, and stewardship in businesses regulated by EPA; and 3) changes to key economic policies to promote a cleaner environment as an integral component of our economy.  I am intent on ensuring that the "cleaner, cheaper" principle guides the work of the Action Groups as well.<p>

	Balance in membership requires the project to add additional stakeholders from the environmental community, including environmental justice groups.  I'm happy to report that, subsequent to my last update to you (May 15), two additional environmental groups have joined the project: the Natural Resources Defense Council and Friends of the Earth.  Project staff continue to hold discussions with several other potential stakeholders, and I am confident that we will secure additional participation.  I am also committed to creating balance in the membership of the Steering Committee and in the ranks of the Action Group co-chairs.<p>

			   Critical to the success of the Enterprise for the Environment is a well-		    	    designed, balanced, and well-managed process of consensus-building.  The Keystone Center excels in this task, which is why I asked Keystone to join CSIS and NAPA in this undertaking.  Keystone will design, lead, and manage the stakeholder process, and will facilitate all meetings.<p> 

	Another factor vital to a good process is the full engagement of the members.  We have assembled a talented and experienced group of stakeholders.  We need to ensure that the members themselves are actively participating, and are the driving force behind the project.  Members' staff can assist the process, but they cannot substitute for the members, even when discussions delve into "the details" (where the devil often lies).  I expect that it will be appropriate for various interested parties to attend some meetings and be allowed to comment on the proceedings.  Such comment can be helpful but will never substitute for the hard work required by project members.  The Keystone Center has prepared a draft set of groundrules for participation in the project.  I have attached this draft and your comments and suggestions would be helpful as we finalize it. <p> 

	One last process issue worth emphasizing is the role of the Steering Committee.  The role of the Steering Committee is to synthesize and integrate the work of the various Action Groups.  The Committee is also the starting point for consensus-building.  Consensus reached in the Steering Committee will be taken to the larger stakeholder group in a effort to gain the broadest support possible. <p> 

	Finally, success is dependent on a high-quality, fact-based work product.  The work of the Action Groups and the Steering Committee must be grounded in solid research and analysis, and on careful problem definitions -- "solutions" cannot wander in search of problems.  Solutions must address real problems.  Given that some policy recommendations may involve proposals for statutory change, it is particularly important that any such  recommendations be based on careful legal analysis of what policy changes require legislative versus administrative actions. <p>   

<b>NEXT STEPS</b><br>
	Nearly all of you have returned your Action Group Preference Forms as requested in my May 15 memo.  Keystone, working with CSIS, is close to finalizing Action Group membership, in consultation with the Action Group co-chairs.  We are not able to assign all stakeholders to the Action Groups for which they expressed their highest preferences; however, we made every effort to satisfy as many preferences as possible.  Upon finalizing these memberships, Keystone facilitators will contact members and, working with the co-chairs, set up the first meetings.<p>

	Later this month, the Steering Committee will meet to review the overall direction of the project and the draft workplans for the Action Groups that project staff have been developing in consultation with the co-chairs.  After receiving Steering Committee input, Action Group co-chairs will take the workplans to their initial Action Group meetings for further input and final shaping.<p> 
          
	Let me close by thanking each of you for your support of the Enterprise for the Environment, and for the commitment of your personal time and attention.  With many of our organizational and membership issues nearing resolution, I look forward to working with you as we move forward on the challenging substantive work before us.<p><hr>

RE:	Project Update and Next Steps</b><p>




	This is to update you on the progress of the Enterprise for the Environment since the April 1-2 Plenary Session, and to describe the next steps in the project.<p> 

	A high priority for the project staff and me in the wake of the April Plenary has been to recruit additional environmental groups as members of the Enterprise for the Environment.  Over the past month, we renewed existing contacts and established new contacts with a half dozen national organizations, and we engaged in extensive discussions with several of these groups.  Over the course of those discussions, we jointly developed a broadened agenda for the project, incorporating many of their ideas and those from the Plenary.  This broadened agenda is described in the enclosed Summary.  Despite this progress, I regret to say that we have yet to reach agreement on participation by additional national environmental groups.<p>
     
	It is my belief that, having agreed in the discussions with several of these groups to broaden the project's agenda, it is appropriate for us to continue on this path.  Their contributions to this agenda have improved it.  We will continue to seek the participation of additional environmental groups as we move forward.  In addition, we will make every effort to incorporate the views of these national environmental groups and keep them fully informed of our deliberations.  But whether or not such organizations participate, it should remain our intention to see this project to a productive and timely conclusion.  Both the need for genuine reform, and the likelihood of a "window of rationality" opening early in the next Congress, are great.  High quality recommendations from a broad-based, responsible process will appeal to reasonable people from both parties, and could form the basis for a comprehensive reform effort.<p>

<b>NEXT STEPS</b><br>
	We are in the process of convening the Action Groups to begin their work.  I have enclosed a revised description of each Group's scope of work that lists some of the questions that the various groups might explore.  The Action Groups are similar in structure to those proposed back in April.  Some of you have already expressed your interest in particular Groups, but you should quickly review this document once more and confirm your preferences for serving on those Action Groups. <p>

		 	   The plan for moving forward is as follows.  By this memo, each Stakeholder is being asked to complete the attached form indicating your preferences for serving on specific Action Groups.   Please FAX the form back to the project office at CSIS no later than Wednesday, May 22.    We will use the completed forms to organize the Action Groups.  In deploying the available experts and interests effectively, it may well turn out that not all members can be given their first choice.  Accordingly, please be sure to indicate your alternative preferences.  Some Steering Committee members may wish to participate only at the Steering Committee level; others may wish to participate in Action Groups as well.  The form permits Steering Committee members to indicate their preference in this regard.  Finally, the form allows members to request more information on the International Perspectives Project, which will analyze environmental management systems in other countries, and will develop insights for the Action Groups.<p>

	Project  staff will notify you no later than Wednesday, May 29, of your Action Group assignment.  Following this, Action Group co-chairs, working with project staff and in consultation with members, will develop work plans and meeting schedules.  The Steering Committee, at its June 20th meeting, will review work plans from the Action Group co-chairs and approve an overall work plan for the project.  A draft set of milestones is enclosed to give you a rough idea of the timelines necessary in delivering our product.  Again, thank you for participating in this worthwhile and necessary project. <p>

<b>Introduction</b><p>

	Three trends have developed as America has pursued environmental cleanup programs over the past 25 years.  First, strong national environmental laws and expanded state and local programs have produced major progress in abating many of the more visible forms of pollution.  Second, the rigidity of many of these laws and regulations has produced growing frustration within the regulated community and beyond.  Third, the environmental community and others have objected to the faltering pace of efforts to address new environmental goals and to implement incomplete existing programs.  While America has made an impressive journey in the last 25 years, the road ahead is strewn with obstacles that will prevent continued success unless they are removed.<p>

	The problems of regulatory rigidity and the faltering pace of achieving environmental objectives are widely acknowledged but the nation has made little progress in addressing either problem. In large part, this has occurred because various interests have pursued solutions to one of these problems but not both, perceiving progress on one problem as detrimental to progress on the other. To move forward, diverse stakeholders must work together to seek integrated changes in the regulatory process and in key economic policies which, in combination, can enhance environmental performance and decrease regulatory rigidity. <p>

	Several broadly endorsed principles should guide the evolution of the environmental protection system:<br>
<ul>
<li>The environmental protection system needs to become more effective, efficient and equitable without undermining the strengths that have ensured the progress made over the last 25 years.  To accomplish this it should become more goal-based, performance-based, and flexible, with accountability mechanisms to ensure full performance.

<li>Change is needed to ensure that the policies and practices of businesses, non-profits, government agencies, and individuals will promote a healthy environment and continued economic progress. Members of the regulated community need to achieve higher levels of responsibility, accountability, commitment, and stewardship as the environmental protection system evolves.

<li>Changes to the existing environmental protection system should not be considered in isolation.  It is important to identify and change other key economic policies, including taxation, subsidies, trade, energy, transportation, agriculture, and research and development which have an indirect but powerful effect on the behavior of the regulated community and society as a whole.  As changes to the existing system are considered, changes to these other policies and practices should be integrated into a new environmental protection system to assure that economic and environmental goals are pursued in harmony.</ul><p>

<b>The Enterprise for the Environment</b><p>

	William  D. Ruckelshaus, former Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, is chairing a policy forum, entitled "Enterprise for the Environment", that focuses on improving the regulatory process and environmental performance drivers that influence behavior in the areas EPA was created to address.   The project will aim to build a broad, durable, bipartisan consensus for comprehensive reform and improvement of the environmental protection system and the economic policies that drive public and private decisions affecting the environment.  Parallel to the three principles above, Enterprise for the Environment will develop sound, concrete policy recommendations in three areas: 1) transformation of EPA's environmental protection system, with particular emphasis on its statutory base; 2) mechanisms that promote higher levels of responsibility, accountability, commitment, and stewardship in businesses regulated by EPA; and 3) changes to key economic policies to promote a cleaner environment as an integral component of our economy.  These three areas are discussed in more detail in the sections below, as are the links among them.<p>

<b>Transforming EPA's Environmental Protection System</b><p>

	The environmental laws Congress enacted and amended in the 1970's and 1980's responded to public pressure for environmental improvement and frustration with the nation's slow progress in meeting environmental goals.  Because of the strong goals and authorities in these laws, major reductions in air and water pollution and improved management of hazardous waste have occurred.  Through these laws, however, Congress has created high expectations that have been difficult for EPA to fulfill for a variety of reasons.  Collectively, the laws place enormous responsibilities on EPA, yet the Agency rarely has had the resources to match its workload.  Splintered congressional committee jurisdiction over EPA hinders coordination, integration, and rational oversight.  Some provisions of these laws have been criticized as highly prescriptive, containing directives and statutory deadlines that critics argue inappropriately restrict the agency's ability to exercise judgment, set more effective priorities, or coordinate programs.  The result is that regulatory approaches often are perceived as rigid and inefficient, insensitive to the needs of local communities, failing to take advantage of new pollution prevention techniques, and not delivering the desired improvement in the environment.<p>

	Building on the strengths of existing laws, Enterprise for the Environment will develop recommendations that seek to integrate EPA's authorities, and that give EPA a coherent, well-defined statutory mission and the tools to carry it out.  The recommendations will aim to transform EPA's environmental protection system into one that is goal-based, performance-based, flexible, and accountable.  A transformed system will empower EPA to deliver higher levels of environmental protection at lower cost.  The Enterprise will pay particular attention to the Agency's statutory framework, given its powerful role in shaping the broader environmental protection system.  However, all recommendations will be based on careful analysis of what changes require legislative versus administrative actions.<p> 
 
<b>Strengthening Responsibility, Accountability, Commitment, and Stewardship</b><p>

	The Enterprise for the Environment will develop recommendations to transform the complex set of incentives and disincentives which influence corporate decision-making on environmental management issues.  The project will examine efforts in the areas of industrial ecology and pollution prevention (e.g., the Pollution Prevention Pilot Project -- a collaborative effort of the Natural Resources Defense Council, the New Jersey Dept. of Environmental Protection, and four major corporations). The project may examine other initiatives such as the Valdez Principles and the Responsible Care program of the Chemical Manufacturers Association as methods to spur higher levels of environmental protection.  <p>

	These examinations will produce an understanding of the internal and external barriers to investments in pollution prevention that improve protections while reducing costs.  This understanding, in turn, will inform the project's efforts to  transform EPA's environmental protection system.  It will also inform recommendations on mechanisms that promote higher levels of responsibility, accountability, commitment, and stewardship in businesses regulated by EPA -- a necessary corollary to change within EPA.<p>

<b>Reshaping Economic Drivers to Support Environmental Excellence</b><p>

	The decisions that businesses make with an eye toward short-term profitability may conflict with decisions that reflect a long-term societal perspective and  promote sustained environmental health and economic prosperity.  To reduce this conflict, Enterprise for the Environment will develop recommendations for changes in key economic policies that exert powerful influences on actions with environmental consequences.<p>

	It is well-understood that government policies in the arenas of taxation, subsidies, trade, energy, transportation, agriculture, and research and development all shape private sector investment decisions and business practices (as well as community development decisions).  However, there has been little concerted effort to date to identify changes in these policy areas that could reward environmentally superior decisions and discourage unsustainable practices.  Without change to these powerful economic influences, modification of the regulatory system alone would not provide a secure path to the high quality, sustainable environmental future Americans demand and expect for this generation and those that follow. <p>

	Enterprise for the Environment will proceed from the recognition that environmental protection strategies must include changes in key economic policies, but will go beyond previous efforts by formulating specific recommendations for changes in these policies that will support a more flexible, performance-based public environmental protection system.  The project will focus on economic policies that influence behavior in areas EPA was created to address.<p>

<b>Project Design</b><p> 

	Taken together, recommendations in these three areas can provide a path to a system of environmental protection that promotes mutually sustaining goals: a cleaner environment; more effective, less expensive, more flexible, and more equitable tools for meeting environmental standards; greater consensus-building and partnership in setting and achieving environmental goals; economic policies that reinforce and promote environmental protection; and greater public confidence in government and the regulated community.<p>

	Three institutions are collaborating in Enterprise for the Environment: the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS), The Keystone Center, and the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA). CSIS will convene an inclusive stakeholder process designed and facilitated by the Keystone Center.  The stakeholder process will aim to develop the specific policy recommendations. CSIS and NAPA will provide analytic support to the stakeholder process, including an independent NAPA panel report on efforts by EPA and others to promote more effective and efficient environmental management. Using a stakeholder process supported by solid, independent analysis, Enterprise for the Environment aims to create a broad, durable, bipartisan consensus on comprehensive reform and improvement of the nation's environmental protection system.<p>

	The Chairman of the project, Mr. Ruckelshaus, and the institutions involved, are securing the participation of members of Congress, and leaders from EPA, state and local government, business, the environmental community, and other essential constituencies.  If  these diverse interests can find agreement, the project will deliver a package of timely recommendations to Congress and the Administration during the 105th Congress.<p>

<h3>Action Groups</h3>
<i>Topics and Leadership</i>
<hr><p>

<b>Action  Group #1 -- Setting a Course:  Goals, Priorities and Resource Allocation</b><p>

		This group's three-part agenda involves looking at (1) designing and implementing  a goal-based decision-making process within EPA; (2) improving resource allocation consistent with these goals; and (3) using environmental indicators as mechanisms for m
easuring the performance of the environmental management system.<p>

  		The leadership of this Action Group consists of three co-chairs:<br>

<ul>
<li>Curt Spalding, Executive Director of Save the [Narragansett] Bay
			
<li>Jim Strock, Secretary of the California Environmental Protection Agency and former Assistant Administrator for Enforcement of U.S. EPA

<li>Bob Sussman, partner in the law firm of Latham & Watkins
and former Deputy Administrator of U.S. EPA</ul><p>		


<b>Action Group #2 -- Setting Standards:  Meeting Goals with Efficiency and Fairness</b><p>

	This group is addressing standard-setting by developing a "Framework for Environmental Decision-Making."  This framework articulates four types of objectives for managing environmental problems, including:  Baseline Protections, Aspirational Goals,  Mile
stones to Reach Aspirational Goals, and Maintenance of Quality Environments.  The Action Group is deliberating on the criteria to be used for defining and achieving these objectives, including the role of cost, risk, equity and enforceability and the proc
ess for establishing and periodically reviewing these objectives.<p>

It is led by two co-chairs:<br>

<ul>
<li>Lee Thomas, Senior Vice President, Georgia-Pacific Corporation and former Administrator, U.S. EPA

<li>Christine Gregoire, Attorney General, State of Washington</ul>
<p>


<b>Action Group #3 -- Enhancing Environmental Performance and Flexibility</b><p>

	This group is exploring internal corporate decision-making in order to identify the  internal and external incentives/disincentives for companies to enhance environmental performance.  One  tool that the Action Group is considering is auditing, specifica
lly, how to encourage small and medium businesses to audit, how to design sector-specific audits for such businesses and how to incorporate "beyond compliance" elements into audits.  The group will also build on recent work by the Aspen Institute and othe
rs in exploring "alternative compliance"/alternative pathways to boost environmental performance while increasing flexibility.  Finally, the Action Group is identifying the ways in which regulations may create barriers to enhanced performance and how to s
tructure a regulatory system to encourage enhanced environmental  performance. <p>

Its two co-chairs are:<br>

<ul>
<li>Linda Fisher, Vice President, Federal Government Affairs, Monsanto Co. and former Assistant Administrator of U.S. EPA

<li>Linda Greer, Senior Scientist, Natural Resources Defense Council</ul><p>



<b>Action Group #4 -- Reshaping Environmental Drivers to Support Environmental Excellence</b><p>

	This group is looking at incentives for environmental performance which are generally outside of EPA's purview, including: economic incentives, trade policies and the effect of information  on capital markets.  The group will also explore broader informa
tion issues concerning  how environmental information is gathered, analyzed, and released. <p>

Its two co-chairs are:<br>

<ul>
<li>Bob Burt, Chairman, President and CEO, FMC Corporation

<li>Jonathan Lash, President, World Resources Institute
and Co-Chair of the President's Council on Sustainable Development</ul>

<a name="Overview"><h3>Overview of the ICS Program</h3></a>

The CSIS International Communications Studies Program has a long track record of assisting senior-level policymakers in both developing and industrialized countries in addressing the impact of changing technological, political, and market dynamics. The ICS Program gives priority to bringing together government officials and industry leaders on an equal footing. ICS reports, forums, and seminars provide analysis and first-hand insights into the issues affecting the rapidly evolving telecom, broadcast, and
information service industries in a global context. ICS work is designed to promote effective strategic planning and workable policy initiatives for both government and industry.
<p>
ICS operates as a catalyst for action as well as analysis. Each year, it targets cutting-edge issues and technologies in the context of policy reforms and market applications. Where feasible, ICS also responds to invitations from governments and industry sectors to spearhead joint forums and analysis. In addition to activities focused on industrialized countries in Europe, Asia, and Latin America, ICS is expanding its work with "nations in transition" such as China, South Africa, and India.
<p>
As outgrowths of its forums, roundtables, and seminars, ICS has published over 25 major reports covering a diversity of issues, including <i>Microchips, Markets, and Madonna: The New Multimedia Mix</i>; <i>The New European Satellite Smorgasbord: Dishing Up Policies & Technologies of the 90's</i>; <i>The New Spectrum Mudwrestle</i>; <i>Telecommunications Policy: Issues for a New Administration</i>; and <i>Wireless World Wonders: Untethering the Marketplace</i>. ICS work involving "nations in transition" is
 internationally recognized for its groundbreaking precedents and far-reaching recommendations. <i>Eastern Europe: Please Stand By</i>, the report of the U.S. Task Force on Telecom and Broadcast in Eastern Europe chaired by <a href="http://www.csis.org/html/4dougan.html>Ambassador Diana Lady Dougan</a> (ICS Chair), continues to be widely used as a blueprint for development and policy reform in both the telecom and broadcast sectors. A parallel landmark initiative under ICS leadership was the convening of
the first government-industry colloquium with the ministers of communications of all the former Soviet republics following the disbandment of the USSR.
<p>
Recent international initiatives launched by Ambassador Dougan under ICS auspices include the <a href="http://www.csis.org/html/2giic.html">Global Information Infrastructure Commission</a> (GIIC) and the Center for Information Infrastructure & Economic Development (CIIED). The GII Commission is an independent, nongovernmental body composed of industry leaders from developing and industrialized countries dedicated to promoting policies and practices that foster the effective development and application of global information infrastructure. CIIED, a permanent center based in Beijing, was established in 1995 at the invitation of the prestigious Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. CIIED's Board includes senior policy officials from all the relevant ministries and actively involves diverse international industry experts.
<hr>
<a name="Priorities"><h3>1996-1997 Program Priorities</h3>
The 1996-97 ICS Program builds on the momentum of its ongoing activities and initiatives. High priority will be given to supporting the mandates and goals of the GIIC and CIIED. Activities are grouped in three major areas:
<p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li><a href="#Cyberspace">Restructuring for Cyberspace: Moving Countries from Theory to Reality</a></li><br>
<li><a href="#Electronic Commerce">Globalization of Electronic Commerce</a></li><br>
<li><a href="#Iiq">Information Intelligence Quotient - The IIQ&copy;</a></li><br>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
<a name="Cyberspace"><h4>1. Restructuring for Cyberspace: Moving Countries from Theory to Reality</h4></a>
<b>Background</b>: Over 50 countries are currently developing or implementing massive reform of their telecom laws and regulations to attract investment, infrastructure development, and service offerings. Companies and countries are also restructuring to respond to, or to co-opt, the new dynamics of multimedia market potential, on the one hand, and the still-remaining basic telephone network requirements on the other.
<p>
<b>Importance</b>:  Restructuring the incumbent public network and enabling alternative technologies and networks are economically complex and politically sensitive issues in virtually all countries. Although there are no perfect models, a number of countries are moving from theory to practice with varying degrees of success. In addition to aiding government policymakers appraise their options, lessons derived from
these countries' experiences can be vital strategic planning tools for customers and providers of communications technologies and services.
<p>
<b>Purpose</b>:  To facilitate direct dialogue and cooperative analysis among private and public sector decision makers; to promote responsive policy options and "models that work"; to assess "real world" impacts of telecom and broadcast restructuring in targeted countries; and to enhance strategic planning capabilities of both government and industry.
<p>
<b>Areas of Focus and Activity</b>: In addition to periodic in-depth forums and analysis papers, ICS will continue its practice of convening informal sessions with senior government officials and industry experts to provide timely attention to fast-breaking legislation and events.
<p>
<blockquote><i>Europe</i>: The commitment of the European Union to liberalize basic telecommunications services by 1998 has generated a fast-paced timetable. At the request of the French and German governments, ICS will convene Washington-based briefings and government/industry roundtables on those countries' new telecommunications legislation. Other European restructuring initiatives will also be featured.<br>
<p>
<i>Asia</i>: The top ICS priority continues to be China. Work carried out through the ICS China Bridge  Project and CIIED will focus on areas of regulatory policy and market restructuring. In follow-up to Ambassador Dougan's in-depth meetings with Vice Premier Zou Jiahua, PTT Minister Wu Jichuan, and other senior Chinese officials, ICS has accepted the invitation to provide assistance in China's examination and analysis of diverse country models and policy options in drafting new laws. CIIED and ICS are developing a series of seminars and workshops examining selected country models and case studies. Scheduled to commence in the fall of 1996, this series will include special lectures and sessions with industry experts and regulators from diverse countries. In addition to forums held at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, under whose auspices CIIED operates, study missions and pilot projects in specific provinces will be considered. Advance papers, reports, and case studies generated for China will also be tailored to other countries that have requested assistance.
</blockquote>
<a name="Electronic Commerce"><h4>2. Globalization of Electronic Commerce</h4></a></center>
<b>Background</b>: "Electronic commerce" is becoming the biggest driver, not just a passenger, on the information highway. This past year, the combination of expanding Internet access and customer-friendly software has turned electronic commerce into a major force in the global marketplace. The ad-hoc, non-hierarchical structure of the Internet has enabled new forms and extensions of commercial activity to evolve largely outside the traditional rules of trade, commerce, and sovereignty. As each industry sector attempts to rationalize its own "rules of the road," governments are ill-equipped to assess the emerging policy and regulatory implications in the broader context. Privacy, ownership, rights, tariffing, and access are just a few of the issues that take on new ramifications in electronically generated or facilitated commerce.
<p>
<b>Importance</b>:  Because electronic commerce is rapidly changing the dynamics and overturning traditional modes of global trade, new ground rules are required to balance effectively new technological and market realities with accepted trade and economic practices.
<p>
<b>Purpose</b>:  To build on the principles adopted in the Beijing Declaration and Call for Action Statement on "Advancing Globalized Electronic Commerce."  Developed under the joint auspices of the GIIC, CIIED, the People's Bank of China, and the Ministry of Electronics Industry in the spring of 1996, the Beijing Declaration provides a pragmatic framework for action. This ICS project will build on the Statement's four principles:
<ul>
<li>increased private-sector leadership in cooperation with governments;</li>
<li>expanded access to the tools of electronic commerce to developing countries; </li>
<li>broad commitment to appropriate legal and regulatory frameworks; and,</li>
<li>rapid transformation of banking and currency management systems.</li>
</ul>
<b>Areas of Focus and Activities</b>:  During 1996-97, the ICS Electronic Commerce Project proposes to
<ul>
<li>facilitate development of common definitions and identify policy options that enhance cross-border electronic commerce. To initiate this work, a forum will be convened in early fall in conjunction with the American Electronics Association to review recent industry studies and recommendations.</li>
<li>analyze what should or can be most effectively done on a voluntary basis by industry rather than by governments. This work will include consideration of electronic commerce ramifications of the World Trade Organization negotiations on liberalizing basic telecommunications services (GBT). ICS will also propose priorities for issues that should appropriately be addressed by multilateral (WTO, ITU, WIPO), bilateral, or voluntary industry agreements.</li>
<li>coordinate one or more follow-up forums and issue papers on specific application aspects of electronic commerce. Already under consideration are</ul>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>a special session with Finance and Central Bank Ministers to be held in conjunction with the October IMF/World Bank meeting. This forum and companion analysis papers will address currency and monetary policies needed to facilitate transborder electronic commerce. </li>
<li>a spring 1997 forum in Shanghai-Pudong in cooperation with CIIED and the People's Bank of China on electronic banking in newly industrialized regions.</li></blockquote>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>publish a critique of perceived cultural and political barriers to cross-border access to Internet and "intranet"-based services. Specific countries will be featured as case studies.</li>
</ul>
<a name="Iiq"><h4>3. Information Intelligence Quotient - The IIQ&copy;</h4></a>
<b>Background</b>:  Electronic communications now reaches far beyond traditional networks, customers, and content providers. Current definitions and measurements of infrastructure, access, and use are inadequate and increasingly misleading in this rapidly changing environment. For example, despite the rapid
introduction of other versatile and increasingly competitive technologies such as cellular, V-sat, and cable, basic telephone density remains the centerpiece of infrastructure measurement. At the Harvard Internet and Society Conference in May 1996, Ambassador Dougan called for the development of an "IIQ" -- Information Intelligence Quotient -- to replace outdated definitions and measurements of communication infrastructure development and use and to support more effective planning and policy development.
<p>
<b>Importance</b>:  By using a common set of benchmarks, both government and industry can better measure and understand the impact of specific policies, practices, and technologies from one country or sector to another. Such benchmarking is especially important when the traditionally regulated telecom, cable, and broadcast industries are being restructured.
<p>
<b>Purpose</b>: To develop a framework for a flexible, comparative measurement that will support analysis,
planning, cooperation, and decision-making. The IIQ will be designed as a strategic tool for both governments and industry to measure and benchmark policies and technology options in three areas: 1) infrastructure; 2) access; and 3) use. The IIQ could also be utilized in the work of the GIIC as part of its legacy.
<p>
<b>Areas of Focus and Activities</b>: The IIQ project will be undertaken in cooperation with several of the GIIC's affiliate organizations to ensure a broadly gauged and useful framework. These include: NECTEC (Thailand), CIIED (China), Harvard University (U.S.), CSIR (South Africa), and other appropriate research organizations. The methodology is to be developed during fall 1996 with project work to commence in spring 1997 and to extend over a two-year period. Work products will include research, reports, presentations, and conferences.

<h2><i>International Communications In Brief</i></h2>
December, 1996
<hr>
<h3>CIIED Seminar Explores Issues of Interconnection and Access Charges<i> -- Dec. 2, 1996</i></h3>
<p>
China is making unique strides for national communication and information modernization. The Ministry of Post and Telecommunications is rapidly building fibre optic, microwave, and satellite communication networks for nationwide voice, data, and advanced services, while more than 30 government organizations or state companies are operating and upgrading their own  dedicated networks. The multi-network environment indicates that China faces a critical challenge of network interconnection.
<p>
To examine network interconnection issues, a special forum was held on December 2, 1996 in Beijing by the <a href="http://www.csis.org/html/ics/2ciied.html">Center for Information Infrastructure and Economic Development (CIIED)</a>, which is co-established by CSIS and the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. The plenary session featured speakers from the Chinese State Council Development Center, the MPT, US West, Cable & Wireless, Mitsubishi, and Matsushita. At the subsequent breakout discussions, senior officials from the MPT, China Unicom, the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Electronic Power, and various international companies addressed issues of regulatory frameworks for interconnection and access charges, and the impact of relevant policies on service provision. The forum involved more than 110 participants representing 30 Chinese government organizations and business entities, as well as numerous foreign companies.
<p>
<hr>
<h3>Mobile Satellite Conference<i> -- Dec. 3, 1996</i></h3>
<p>
Two expert panels addressed regulatory and implementation issues that have arisen concerning the "Big LEO" satellite systems.  The first group presented a report on the World Telecommunications Policy Forum held at the ITU in October, bringing together representatives of government and industry to explore options for resolving those issues, particularly the licensing of these systems. Forum participants endorsed 10 voluntary principles for licensing to guide national regulators and adopted a Memorandum of Understanding regarding user terminals required by the systems. In an important departure from traditional ITU procedure, the MOU can be signed by private sector parties, not just governments. The panelists noted that the private sector played a more active role in this deliberation than in most ITU proceedings and that the forum contributed to a generally receptive attitude on the part of many developing countries toward the  LEO systems. These countries were able to raise and to discuss issues of concern rather than being required to adopt rules or binding positions.
<p>
The second panel of representatives of all five proposed Big LEO systems underscored wide variation in system design - for example, from 12 satellites in two systems to 840 in another. Reflecting the generally positive assessment given by the first panel, the industry representatives were optimistic concerning the reception of their proposed services by countries with developing economies. Once issues related to the systems' impact on matters such as bypass, sovereignty and national security are better understood, the panelists expressed belief that policy makers in those countries will resolve issues related to licensing and type approval relatively easily as the systems represent a flexible, low-cost alternative to expensive wireline infrastructure.
<p>

<h3>Minister Fillon: "France Ready for the Globalization of Telecom Exchanges"<i> -- Dec. 4, 1996</i></h3>
<p>
In a major address hosted by the ICS program at CSIS, French MPT Minister FranÁois Fillon touted the new French telecommunications legislation as second only to the UK in creating an open and deregulated market. According to the minister, the two main components of the reform are a new regulatory framework to establish open competition in the sector and a modification of the status of France Telecom to transform it into a public limited company. Fillon stated that the passage in July of the telecommunications act allowed France to be "totally open to free market and competition in the telecommunications sector."  One of the main points of the new law allows for an open and transparent licensing system that will permit all those with capability to enter the market, without any limit on the number of licences.
<p>
Minister Fillon also praised the creation of a new regulatory authority due to enter into effect on January 1, 1997.  This body will have three essential powers in guiding the regulation of the industry. First, it will lead the preliminary process for license applications and will allocate the frequency and number resources required by operators to carry out their business. Second, it will settle disputes related to interconnection between operators and will set the level of interconnection tariffs.  Third, the authority will have the power to impose financial penalties on operators who fail to observe their obligations under the regulations. In short, according to Minister Fillon, "the regulatory authority will have the capability, from the time of its creation, to ensure the development of competition that is effective, innovative, fair, and beneficial to users."

<h3><p align="center">Project to Transform the Environmental Management System</p></h3>

<b>Washington, D.C. (April 17, 1996)</b>: <a href="http://www.csis.org/html/e4e/ruckbio.html">William D. Ruckelshaus</a>, Chairman of Browning-Ferris Industries, Inc. (BFI) and former Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced today that the "The Enterprise for the Environment," a broad-based effort assembled to develop a comprehensive set of recommendations to transform the environmental management system, held its first meetings April 1st and 2nd.<p>

Ruckelshaus described the project in testimony before the U.S. House Appropriations Subcommittee on VA, HUD and Independent Agencies.  The Subcommittee is chaired by Congressman Jerry Lewis (R-CA).<p>

"The purpose of this effort," said Ruckelshaus, "is to transform the environmental management system by developing a well defined statutory mission for EPA and evaluating incentives for exemplary corporate environmental performance; the result will be a cleaner environment at a reasonable cost.  What we have now is a regulatory system that is perceived as rigid and inefficient, insensitive to the needs of local communities, and that fails to take advantage of new tools which maximize environmental benefits while reducing costs."<p>

The Enterprise for the Environment will be coordinated by the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS) and the National Academy of  Public Administration (NAPA), whose recent report to Congress on EPA will serve as the starting point for the project.  The Keystone Center of Colorado will facilitate certain aspects of the project's work.<p>

"The process for achieving this," said Ruckelshaus, "must acknowledge that the vast majority of Americans place a high value on a clean environment, and that they expect their government to assist in delivering this at a reasonable cost ... Any successful consensus-building process, if designed properly, will include a truly representative group of stakeholders and will be conducted in an open and honest forum.  The project will rely heavily on its greatest asset: the talent and experience of its diverse members."<p>

The Enterprise for the Environment will consist of a steering committee, a number of stakeholder working groups, and a NAPA-convened expert panel.  Membership will be drawn from a wide range of interests, including Members of Congress, governors, mayors, state regulators, and leaders from environmental groups, business, labor, as well as participants from such diverse interests as agriculture, transportation, energy, economics, social justice and the law.<p>

"We think this effort will succeed where other efforts in the past decade have failed," Ruckelshaus stated.  "We have a waiting audience for our work.  Those who have the power to act on our recommendations want our recommendations," he continued.  "The leadership in Congress has given us their encouragement and cooperation.  The EPA, as well, is supportive of our effort."<p>

The group expects to deliver its recommendations to the Congress and the Administration in early 1997.

<h2><i>International Communications In Brief</i></h2>
December 17, 1996
<hr>
<h3>Experts Assess Prospects for WTO Telecom Agreements</h3>
<p>
Government and industry experts expressed guarded optimism this week about the current World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations on liberalizing global telecommunications services. They spoke at a December 17 conference at CSIS, "Global Telecommunications Liberalization: Who Will Benefit?" cosponsored by the CSIS International Communications Studies Program, the Coalition of Service Industries, and the <a href="http://www.gii.org">Global Information Infrastructure Commission (GIIC)</a>. The conference followed the close of the WTO Ministerial Meeting in Singapore.
<p>
FCC Chairman Reed Hundt, said that a successful conclusion will not be easy: "If these talks degenerate into limited commitments to allow competitive provision of yesterday's services - but not tomorrow's - then we will have missed a great opportunity to bring advanced telecom services to every corner of the globe. And, if too few countries guarantee investment rights, then the opportunity to build the global information highway may be lost."
<p>
Don Abelson, chief U.S. negotiator, pointed out that there is now momentum towards a successful conclusion by the Feb. 15 deadline. 16 countries announced new offers at the Ministerial, representing a "major improvement." Summarizing the U.S. position, he said: "We are seeking the kind of offers of a caliber that the U.S. has put on the table, including provision of market access for all services on a technologically neutral basis, together with full opportunity for foreign investment."

<a href="http://www.gii.org/egi00162.html">Bowman Cutter</a>, chair of the GIIC steering committee and managing director of E.M. Warburg, Pincus & Co., observed that financial markets will provide strong incentives for compliance with a trade agreement because non-participating or non-complying nations will face severe difficulty in financing telecom-munications expansion.
<p>
Program participants agreed that significant developments taking place outside the negotiations could affect their outcome. Among them are:
<p>
<i>The FCC's new proposals on international accounting rates.</i> The proposals, announced by the FCC the next day, would lower the benchmark settlement rates that U.S. international carriers negotiate with each country for the origination and termination of international traffic. Peter Cowhey, senior counsel at the FCC International Bureau, pointed out that, while lower benchmarks are not a total solution to distortions in international telecom rates, they can help by reducing "the financial fuel" that sustains wide pricing asymmetry between competitive and non-competitive markets. Erik Olbeter of the Economic Strategy Institute said that a new ESI study indicates that 70 percent of settlement rates are above actual cost. Abelson observed that the FCC proposals will assist in reaching a trade agreement as they will compel pro-competitive pricing reform and will not be compromised through the trade negotiations.
<p>
<i>Information Technology Agreement.</i> Gary Hufbauer of the International Institute of Economics pointed out that the likely agreement on information technologies can strengthen the telecom talks by demonstrating how to square most-favored-nation principles with market reality in the information industries.
<p>
<i>What if the current negotiations fail?</i> Al Lewis, director of federal affairs for AT&T, believed that pressures from telecom users around the world will eventually force resumption of the negotiations. Bob Kramer of the Bank of America suggested that a partial agreement incorporating a base-line minimum could still be valuable because achieving a telecom agreement should provide renewed impetus for concluding a financial services agreement.
<p>
Brian Moir, senior counsel to the International Communications Association, stated that to be successful, an agreement must result in pro-competitive regulatory policies, cost-balanced rates, increased choice and quality of services, and elimination of barriers to technology, functions, and new entry. U.S. firms will need to monitor foreign implementation measures very closely, in the face of obvious temptations to delay or avoid a pro-competition mandate in the agreement. Alexander Sierck of Cameron and Hornbostel stated that U.S. firms need to prepare specific evidence and legal strategies for protecting their opportunities under the regulatory schemes of other countries. This will strengthen a given company's chances if it decides to take its case to the USTR for submission to the WTO disputes settlements process.

<h2><i>International Communications In Brief</i></h2>
December 11, 1996
<hr>
<h3>China's MPT Director General Outlines Issues for New Telecom Law</h3>
<p>
"We're laying the foundation for an information society in China." This was the theme of an in-depth briefing and question and answer session featuring Liu Cai, director general of Policy and Regulation of China's Ministry of Post and Telecommunications (MPT), held at CSIS on December 11.
<p>
Director General Liu and other senior-level delegates from the State Council, National People's Congress, and MPT met with CSIS as part of their assessment mission on U.S. legal and regulatory reforms in telecommunications. Liu, who has lead drafting responsibility for new telecommunication law, said it will take 8-9 months to draft law, but expects to send it to State Council and National Peoples Congress for consideration by end of 1997.
<p>
Legislation is needed, Mr. Liu said, to strengthen the structural framework for China's current telecom expansion. Telecom growth in China has averaged 50 percent annually in the last five years with more than a $60 billion investment in telecom facilities by the turn of the century. 94 percent of transmission lines and 99 percent of the switches including rural are digitalized according to Liu.
<p>
Despite this progress, Chinese telecom development is hampered by outmoded legal and regulatory constraints. "We need to work hard to meet different levels of demand for information transfer." The proposed telecom law will be part of this effort, Mr. Liu said. He cautioned, however, that installation fees would cover 30-40% of investment needed and remain a centerpiece of basic MPT system financing.  He did not dismiss private investment in the embryonic competing UNICOM system.  According to Liu, the legislation will address the following objectives:
<ul>
<li>maintaining the current pace of expan-sion, focusing on telecom's role as a multiplier of economic growth;</li>
<li>decentralizing the present structure of telecom enterprises;</li>
<li>assuring availability of advanced tech-nology, both from foreign sources and expanded domestic R&D facilities;</li>
<li>strengthening competition among foreign and domestic suppliers of network equip-ment, including the possible introduction of open bidding; and</li>
<li>encouraging improvements in financing telecom expansion, including changes in user-pricing patterns.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Regulatory reform at the central government level will tackle difficult problems of what Mr. Liu called "the three separations." They are (a) separating the MPT's postal and telecommunications units; (b) separating MPT's regulatory and operational functions, and (c) separating telecom manufacturing functions from service obligations. He noted likely transformation of the Ministry of Electronics Industries into an "association." He also predicted more network development decisions being devolved to provincial and municipal administrations.
<p>
Director General Liu also serves on the Advisory Board and Governing Council of the Center for Information Infrastructure and Economic Development (CIIED) which operates under the auspices of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and CSIS based in Beijing. CIIED's Board is co-chaired by Diana Lady Dougan of CSIS and Dr. Liu Guoguang of CASS.

<SUP>*</SUP> B'Tselem data refer to Intifada years rather than calendar years. Thus, 
for examples, 1988 data inlude incidents from December 9, 1987 - December 8, 1988.

<B>Notes:</B>
<OL>
<LI> Figures for West Bank include East Jerusalem.
<LI> Revision of the running totals which result in apparent
     discrepancies between this month's data and those of previous months
     are a result of ongoing research, which occasionally yields new
     information regarding past events.

During Searches of Palestinian Homes in Hebron</CENTER></B></FONT>
<HR>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2></FONT>
<I> Please write letters to the authorities listed below and/or distribute this information
as widely as possible. </I>
<P>
B'Tselem has released a report documenting house searches in ten Palestinian
apartments in Hebron, which included discriminatory and degrading strip
searches. The security forces forced fifteen Palestinian women, ranging in
age from 20 to 69, to undress from head to toe in the presence of women
soldiers and/or policewomen. In two instances, women were required to
undress in full vision of a male police officer.  Thirteen children, aged
one month to 14 years old, were also undressed.  In some cases, women were
compelled to undress in front of their relatives, their children and other
children.  The fact that most of the families involved are traditional and
religious, and that female honor is an important concept in Palestinian
society, makes what would be a degrading experience for any woman even more so.
<P>
Violence, threats and insults accompanied the order to undress in several
cases.  Women who initially refused to completely undress (including a
seven-month pregnant woman) were beaten.  Although men were  present in most
of the apartments, only one man was also required to undress.
<P>
The fact that only women and children were ordered to undress, while in
every case but one the men were not required to undergo this degradation,
indicates that this measure was taken to humiliate the women and their
families.  This together with the contemptuous and violent treatment of the
residents and their property, and the fact that almost none of the residents
were detained reinforce the suspicion that the violence and degradation were
intentional and totally unrelated to security needs.
<P>
B'Tselem urges the Israeli government to end this conduct:
<P>
1. The government must unequivocally instruct its security forces not to
order women to undress, and not to offend their honor in any other way; the
government must instruct its security forces that during house searches,
they must safeguard personal property and refrain from causing damage;
<P>
2.  If directives exist allowing such conduct, the authorities must
immediately revoke them and take measures against those who instituted them;
<P>
3. The authorities must thoroughly investigate the events described in this
report and prosecute any soldier or police officer who engaged in wrongoing.
<P>
Although B'Tselem has written to the authorities responsible and distributed
its report to the press, the problem continues.  The day B'Tselem issued
this report, Israeli police searched another house in Hebron and strip
searched four women.  None of the men in the house were required to undress.  
<P>
<B>Letters of concern should be sent to:</B>
<P>
Minister of Internal Security, Avigdor Kahalani, Fax: 972-2-5811832 
<P>
with copies to:
<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, Fax: 972-3-697-6218
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Fax: 972-2-566-4838 
<P>
See B'Tselem's complete report, which includes testimonies of ten women.

<FONT SIZE=+2><B> Beatings and Degredation of Palestinians: <BR>
Routine Rather than Unusual Occurrences </B></FONT><BR>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
 
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>B'</B></FONT>Tselem maintains that the beatings of Palestinians by Border Police
officers broadcast last night on the Israeli evening news are unique only in
that a photographer was present at the scene and filmed the incident.
<P>
Beatings and degradation of Palestinians by Police and Border Police are
common. In B'Tselem's report published in September, "Beatings, Maltreatment
and Degradation of Palestinians by Police during June-July, 1996," ten such
incidents were described, and they are only a sample from the large number
of similar cases about which human rights organizations are aware. The
characterization  by Israeli officials of these incidents as "exceptions" is
only an attempt to minimize a serious and troublesome situation about which
B'Tselem and other human rights organizations have repeatedly warned.
<P>
The B'Tselem report also refutes the contention that the recent beatings are
a response to the events of  September, as the B'Tselem report deals with
events that occurred in June and July.
<P>
Both in the incident which was photographed and in over half of the cases in
B'Tselem's report, Palestinians who enter Israel without permits are beaten
and sent back to the Occupied Territories without being prosecuted.  This
raises the suspicion that there is an unwritten policy of using violence and
humiliation rather than prosecution of the offenders. In any event, the
authorities have clearly adopted a policy to disregard this widespread
phenomenon.
<P>
B'Tselem urges the Israeli government to end, once and for all, the policy
of violence against Palestinians, whether this policy is implemented with
the authorities' formal approval or by their utter disregard of its existence.

<FONT SIZE=+2><B> Military Court in Jaffa: <BR>
Value of a Palestinian's Life - Four Agorot (US$ 0.01) </B></FONT><BR>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
 
                              
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Y</B></FONT>esterday the Jaffa military court gave its verdict in the case of the four
undercover soldiers who had been accused of negligently causing the death of
Iyad Mahmud 'Awal Amali. The court rejected the plea bargain, proposed by
the prosecution and defense, which provided that the defendants would be
sentenced to a conditional sentence of 30 days for a period of one year, and
imposed on each of the defendant's a fine of one agora.
<P>
B'Tselem contends that the judgment, the judges' statements, and the
position taken by the prosecution indicate an intolerable forgiveness,
inconsistent with the rule of law, of the judicial system in cases where
Palestinians are killed.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>
The Case
</B></FONT>
<P>
Iyad Amali was killed on 13 November 1993 while traveling in an automobile
near Salfit village, Nablus District. Testimonies given to B'Tselem by two
persons who were with Amali at the time indicate that the checkpoint was not
properly marked, and that the driver of the car did not realize it was a
military checkpoint and that he was supposed to stop. Bilal Yehiye 'Abd
Al-Fatah 'Amal, the driver, stated in his testimony:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
... After we had gone about 1 1/2 kilometers from Salfit... I started to
ascend, and at the top I saw lots of lights and spotlights, which
prohibited me from traveling any further. I stopped because I couldn't
see. Suddenly, a fellow got out of a car with a searchlight and
directed it at me, and then the shooting started, lots of shooting. I
bent over and saw blood on Iyad's face, and I realized he had been wounded.
I heard the front windshield shatter. I started to yell: "Who are
you? You wounded my friend." Someone answered in Hebrew: We are soldiers."
They approached with searchlights in their hands, and for that reason I
couldn't see who they were.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>
Open-Fire Regulations
</B></FONT>
<P>
The IDF's regulations for opening fire at a motor vehicle that were in
effect in the Occupied Territories at the time of Amali's death explicitly
stipulate that: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"It is prohibited to fire at the suspect's vehicle unless the checkpoint is
positioned conspicuously and illuminated at night - so that the driver is
able to distinguish that the site is a checkpoint of the IDF, or of the
security forces, from a  distance that enables the driver to slow down and
stop in front of the checkpoint."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The regulations also explicitly stipulate that:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"when a vehicle reaches the location of an IDF checkpoint and the vehicle
backs up and flees (and does not break the   barricade), firing is
prohibited unless there is a concrete suspicion based on the circumstances
or on reliable   information, that one of the passengers is suspected of
committing a dangerous crime."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
In the Amali case, the soldiers did not have a concrete suspicion that any
of the passengers in the vehicle were involved in a dangerous crime, and the
shots were fired from a checkpoint that had not been properly set up.
Although the driver did not realize that a checkpoint was in front of him,
he had stopped his car; nevertheless, the soldiers opened fire and killed
Amali. It is patently clear that the shots were fired in violation of the
regulations. 
<P>
In their verdict, the court's majority held that "in the situation in the
field, we would act as the undercover unit acted." This statement indicates
an utter disregard for
human life, and it is doubtful if someone who justifies the killing of an
innocent person should be a judge. Killing an innocent person in total
violation of the written regulations should be strongly censured, and
certainly should not serve as a model for future conduct.
<P>
The willingness of the military prosecutor to enter into a plea bargain that
would have resulted in a conditional sentence of 30 days imprisonment for
the crime of illegal use of weapons raises doubts about the seriousness in
which the military handles violations of the open-fire regulations. The
prosecution's intention to appeal the lightness of the sentence is not
particularly encouraging, because even if its appeal is accepted, it is
unlikely that the subsequent sentence would be heavier than that of the plea
bargain.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>
Statistics
</B></FONT>
<P>
From 9 December 1987 to the end of August, 1996, Israeli security forces
killed 1251 Palestinians, among them 262 children under the age of 16.
Pursuant to the open-fire regulations, the only case in which firing to kill
is permitted is where the shooter is in a life-threatening situation.
B'Tselem knows of 55 members of the Israeli security forces who have been
prosecuted in cases in which Palestinians have been killed. From these 55 cases:
<UL>
<LI>    in 3 cases, those involved were convicted of manslaughter;
<LI>    in 16 cases, those involved were convicted of causing death by negligence;
<LI>    in 2 cases, those involved were convicted of maltreatment and causing
	bodily injury;
<LI>    in 12 cases, those involved were convicted of illegal use of weapons;
<LI>    in one case, those involved were convicted of disgraceful conduct;
<LI>    in one case, those involved were convicted of negligence in performing
	their duty;
<LI>    in 10 cases, those involved were found not guilty;
<LI>    in 5 cases, an indictment was filed, but the trial has not yet ended;
<LI>    in one case, the indictment was withdrawn.
</UL>
These statistics indicate that in over one thousand cases of deaths of
Palestinians, not even one person was indicted for causing the death. Since
it is unlikely that in each of these cases the soldiers were in concrete and
immediate life-threatening situations, which is the only instance in which
the regulations permit firing to kill, the number of cases in which the
open-fire regulations were violated is substantially higher than the number
of indictments filed.
<P>
Almost total disregard of violation of the open-fire regulations transmits a
message to soldiers that breach of the regulations, which lead to numerous
deaths, is permitted and would be accepted with understanding. Yesterday's
military court's judgment, which imposed symbolic punishment on soldiers who
had been found guilty of having killed a human being only reinforces this
conclusion and raises the question of the importance the military gives to
human life.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in his speech to the United States Congress: 

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=red>
"The time has come for countries in the Middle East to place human rights
and democracy on their agendas."</FONT> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>                         
The Facts:
</B></FONT>
<P>

Since 1967, Israel has reduced the number of East Jerusalem
Palestinians in the city by various means:
<P>
<U><B>Housing:</B></U>
<UL>
<LI>   Israel expropriated from Palestinians more than one-third
     of East Jerusalem's land area (some 23,500 km2), on which it
     built tens of thousands of housing units solely for the city's
     Jewish population. At the same time, the Israeli government
     refrained from planning and developing Palestinian residential
     areas.
<P>
<LI>   Because Israel refused to grant building permits to
     Palestinians, many were forced to build without the requisite 
     permits.
<P>
<B>The result:</B><UL>
Since 1967, the gap in housing density between Jews and Palestinians has doubled.
</UL></UL>
<U><B>Residency:</B></U>
<UL>
<LI>   Israel granted Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem the
     legal status of residents comparable to that granted foreign
     nationals who settled in Israel. Consequently, in the city
     of their birth, Israel treats Palestinians like foreigners.
<P>
<LI>   In many instances, Israel revoked the East Jerusalem residency
     status of Palestinians, among them Palestinians living in
     the city's West Bank suburbs, those residing abroad, and those
     who became citizens of foreign countries.
<P>
<LI>   The Israeli authorities make it difficult for residents of
     the Occupied Territories married to a city resident to obtain
     Jerusalem resident status. A child whose father is not a city
     resident does not have the right to live in Jerusalem, even
     if his mother is a city resident.
<P>
<B>The result:</B>
<UL> 
Thousands of Palestinians have lost their right
     to live in Jerusalem; families are forced to leave the city
     to live together; children do not receive education, health,
     and welfare services.
</UL>
</UL>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>
The Conclusions:
</B></FONT>
<UL>
<LI>   Israel's policy towards Palestinian residents of Jerusalem
     contradicts fundamental democratic principles and grossly
     violates basic human rights.
<P>
<LI>   The permanent status of the city must be determined within
     the framework of the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. Until
     a permanent status is reached, Israel must:
<UL>
<P>
     <LI>    grant irrevocable permanent residency status to East
          Jerusalem's Palestinian residents, including those whose
          residency was revoked;
<P>
     <LI>    grant residency status to the spouse and children of
          East Jerusalem residents, and supply the services inherent
          in such status;
<P>
     <LI>    allocate land and prepare town planning schemes for
          Palestinian neighborhoods in appropriate scope to meet
          their needs.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in his speech to the United States Congress: 

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=red>
"The time has come for countries in the Middle East to place human rights

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

     
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>                         
The Facts:
</B></FONT>
<UL>
<LI>    Israel has expropriated hundreds of thousands of square
     kilometers from Palestinians in the Occupied Territories and
     established on them permanent civilian settlements of Jewish
     Israeli citizens to alter the demography and create political
     facts on the ground.
<P>
<LI>    International conventions prohibit an occupier from
     transferring persons from its territory to the occupied
     territory and from taking any action not intended for military
     needs or to benefit the local population.
<P>
<LI>    Israel prevented development of Palestinian towns and villages
     and Palestinian agriculture and hampered their chances for
     self-determination. It created a situation in which two
     populations living in the same area are subject to different
     systems of law and separate infrastructures; one population
     (the settlers) is granted widescale benefits, and the other
     population (the Palestinians) is denied basic rights and
     restricted in innumerable ways.
<P>
<LI>    Most of the settlers did not violate Israel's laws when they
     settled in the Occupied Territories; it was Israeli governments
     that violated international law by promoting settlements and
     offering incentives to populate them.
</UL>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>
The Questions:
</B></FONT>
<P>
Aren't the settlements needed for security? Not at all:
<UL>
<LI>    During implementation of the interim agreements, Israel closed
     many military bases in the Gaza Strip and throughout the West
     Bank. However, it did not evacuate one settlement even in
     cases where it was particularly difficult to defend the
     settlers. 
<P>
<LI>    The settlements intended to protect us are protected by large
     numbers of security forces, thousands of kilometers of
     additional land have been expropriated to pave bypass roads
     at a cost of hundreds of millions of shekels, and now the
     IDF is allocating forces to protect these roads that protect
     the settlements that are intended to protect us. There is
     no end to it.
<P>
<LI>    The settlements delay and complicate security and civil
     arrangements in the Occupied Territories. Hebron is only one
     small example of this major problem.
</UL>
Why are Jews prohibited from settling in all of the Land of Israel?
<UL>

<LI>    The prohibition on settlement is not based on nationality
     or race, but rather is intended to prevent "colonization"
     of the occupied territory. Israel may administer the area
     temporarily, but it may not make permanent changes, certainly
     not by establishing settlements for its citizens, and not
     by unilateral action.
</UL>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>
The Conclusions:
</B></FONT>
<UL>
<LI>    Israel must immediately cease expropriating land, enlarging
     settlements, establishing new settlements, and paving bypass
     roads.
<P>
<LI>    Settlers' human rights must not be violated.  If it is ultimately
     agreed to evacuate them, Israel must ensure their housing,
     sources of income, education for their children, etc.
     Alternatively, if it is agreed that the settlers will remain
     in the territories, they must reside there as citizens with
     equal rights under the authority or state in which they will
     be located.

<FONT SIZE=+2><B> Speak Up for Academic Freedom </B><BR>
 A Public Campaign for Gaza Students' Right to Education </FONT><BR>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
 
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>A</B></FONT>s university students throughout the world begin a new academic year, many
Palestinians from the Gaza Strip are being denied their basic right to
education. Out of a total of 1,200 students from the Gaza Strip who are
enrolled in West Bank universities, not one has been granted the permits
necessary to attend their universities.
<P>
The blanket restriction imposed by Israel on hundreds of Gazan students,
without a shred of evidence that they threaten the security of Israel,
consitutes collective punishment and violates their basic rights to
education and freedom of movement.  This policy increases the cost of
education, thereby hindering the advancement of Gazan society.  Furthermore,
these restrictions contradict the letter and spirit of the Oslo agreements
signed by Israel and the Palestinians and hinder the development of peace
and stability in the region.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>
Background
</B></FONT>
<P>
Over 900,000 Palestinians live in the Gaza Strip.  The two Gaza universities
have a combined enrollment of 8,000 students.  These institutions offer only
limited fields of study and cannot accommodate all qualified Gazans who want
to pursue higher education.   As a result, 1,200  Gaza residents study at
the six West Bank universities.  Gaza students comprise 7% of the student
body of West Bank universities.
<P>
Israeli-imposed travel restrictions are not new.  In 1991, Israel first
imposed an extended closure on the Occupied Territories, sealing off the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.  Since that time, even when a total closure is not
in place, Palestinians are only allowed to enter Israel or East Jerusalem by
obtaining a special permit.  These permits are usually issued for a single
day, but can be issued for up to a maximum of three months. Without a
permit, Palestinians are also unable to travel between the West Bank and
Gaza as Israel lies in between.
<P>
Although the closure and its accompanying permit system has been in place
since 1991, Israel has never established clear and transparant regulations
to govern the process.  On the contrary, the permit process is highly
arbitrary and overly bureaucratic.  Palestinians who want to travel from
Gaza to the West Bank must first undergo a rigorous security check to
receive the magnetic identity card necessary to leave the Gaza Strip.
Second, they must obtain a permit to travel through Israel.  Palestinians
who wish to stay overnight in the West Bank must obtain a third permit.
Applicants who are denied any of these permits are not informed of the
reason for denial, nor given an opportunity to appeal.  All travel permits
are cancelled each time Israel imposes a total closure on the Occupied
Territories.  
<P>
Since the imposition of a total closure in March 1996, following a series of
suicide-bombings inside Israel, Gaza students have not even enjoyed the
problematic permit system described above.  Even after this closure was
relaxed, all Gazans requesting permits to travel to the West Bank to study
have been rejected; Israel has not allowed a single Gaza student to attend a
West Bank university for the 1996/7 school year.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>
Gazan Students in The West Bank: A Security Threat to Israel?
</B></FONT>
<P>
Israeli officials use security considerations to justify travel restrictions
on Gaza students. In response to a recent inquiry, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai responded that, "for security reasons, we cannot allow Gaza
residents to study at West Bank educational institutions." In fact, however,
there is no legitimate security basis for denying Gaza students the right to
study in the West Bank.  
<P>
While Israel has a right to decide who enters its borders, Gaza students are
not interested in entering Israel.  Gaza students are only requesting to
cross through Israel to reach West Bank universities and to remain in the
West Bank for the period of their studies. If certain students are thought
to pose a security risk, this risk could be eliminated by providing them
with a security escort from Gaza to the West Bank at the beginning of each
semester.
<P>
The Israeli authorities do not restrict the movement of individual Gaza
students whom they suspect pose a security threat to Israel. All students
are restricted, even those who have passed all necessary security checks.
This suggests that limitations on Gaza students are not based solely on
security concerns, but are also intended as a punitive measure against Gaza
students as a group.  Such a measure constitutes collective punishment,
which inevitably increases the despair and hopelessness among Palestinian
youth.  This can only have negative implications for Israel's security.
<P>
As an Israeli organization, B'Tselem fully appreciates the need and
obligation of the Israeli government to adopt protective measures to ensure
the security of its citizens.  However, these measures must comply with
international law, including human rights principles and agreements which
Israel has signed.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>
The Cost of an Education
</B><FONT>
<P>
As a result of delays in the issuance of permits at the beginning of 1995/6
academic year and the cancellation during the closure, Gaza university
students were allowed to attend their West Bank universities for a total of
three months out of the previous academic year and for none of the current
year. 
<P>
The myriad of obstacles preventing Gaza students from obtaining an education
cause tremendous hardships.  Even when a total closure is not in force,
permits may be cancelled or not renewed in the middle of a semester, causing
students to miss course work or final exams.  Many students, determined to
continue their studies, remain in the West Bank without the necessary
permits, risking detention if apprehended by Israeli security forces.
Students who return to the Gaza Strip for family visits may not be able to
get back to the West Bank.  
<P>
All of these hardships increase the time and money needed for a Gaza student
to complete a degree, raising the cost of higher education for the
individual and for Palestinian society as a whole.

        The last time I went home to Gaza was 11 months ago, for 2 days. I 
        haven't gotten a permit since 1992. It's a very unpleasant feeling 
.... I'm here without a permit, always worried and feeling under attack ...
It really
        affects our studies.... At any minute, we could be caught at a
checkpoint, 
        and then we're finished, our whole future is ruined.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>
A Breach of International Law and the Oslo Agreements
</B></FONT>
<P>
Preventing Gazan students from exercising their basic right to study in West
Bank universities blatantly violates internationally recognized rights to
education and freedom of movement.  This policy denies students these right
without due process of law and violates the internationally accepted
principle that an individual cannot be punished for the actions of another. 
<P>
In addition, this policy contravenes obligations undertaken by Israel in the
Israeli-Palestinian Accords. The agreements stipulate that the Gaza Strip
and West Bank comprise a single territorial entity. Israel undertook in
these agreements to provide "safe passage connecting the West Bank with the
Gaza Strip for movement of persons, vehicles and goods." Israel has not
provided this safe passage.
<P>
A peace process based on human rights violations is fragile and vulnerable
at its core. It is imperative, therefore, that the international community
acts to ensure that human rights are made an integral part of the peace
process. 
<P>
Now is the time for Israel to realize that security can and must be
protected without violating basic human rights. It is time to realize that
an equitable coexistence between Israelis and Palestinians based on mutual
respect of fundamental human rights is the only basis for a just, secure,
and lasting peace.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in his speech to the United States Congress: 

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR=red>
"The time has come for countries in the Middle East to place human rights
and democracy on their agendas."</FONT> 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+1><B>                         
The Facts:
</B></FONT>
<P>

During nearly 30 years of occupation, Israel has created almost total
Palestinian dependence
on Israel by limiting development of economic, employment, and medical
infrastructure in
the Occupied Territories.
<P>
Since 1991, Israel has severely restricted the freedom of movement of
Palestinians in the Occupied
Territories, preventing most of them from entering Israel and East Jerusalem
and from travelling
between the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. At times, Israel has imposed a
total closure which
does not allow any Palestinian to leave the West Bank or the Gaza Strip. 
<P>
The closure harms all aspects of daily life for the Palestinian population,
and causes, inter
alia, the elimination of sources of income, harm to sick persons, disruption
of family relations,
and economic losses.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>
The Question:
</B></FONT>
<P>
Does not every nation have the right to restrict entry of foreigners? Yes, but:
<UL>
<LI>    In the Oslo Accords, Israel did not relinquish supreme authority in
	the Occupied Territories. 
      	It therefore must ensure the welfare, the means to make a living, and
	the health of the residents there.
<P>
<LI>    Israel does not have the right to restrict the Palestinians' freedom
	of movement within and between the Occupied Territories:
	<UL>
	<P>
      	<LI>    The closure does not allow for movement between the Gaza Strip
		and the West Bank. In the framework of the Oslo Accords, Israel recognized
		the West Bank and the Gaza Strip as one unit, and undertook to ensure safe
		passage between them; Israel has not fulfilled this undertaking.
	<P>
      	<LI>	The closure prevents entry of Palestinians from the West Bank
		and the Gaza Strip into East Jerusalem because Israel considers East
		Jerusalem as an integral
	        part of Israel. East Jerusalem is the medical, economic,
		religious and educational
            	center for Palestinians. According to international law and the
		entire international
            	community, the status of East Jerusalem is identical to that of
		the rest of the
            	West Bank, and Israel unilaterally ignores this fact.  
	</UL>
</UL>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>
The Conclusions:
</B></FONT>
<UL>
<LI>    Israel must enable free movement between the Gaza Strip and the West
	Bank, as required by the Oslo agreements.
<P>
<LI>    Israel must remove the restrictions on Palestinians entering East
	Jerusalem.
<P>
<LI>    Israel must ensure movement of sick persons from the Occupied
	Territories to medical facilities in East Jerusalem and in Israel.
<P>
<LI>    Israel must immediately act to ensure alternative sources of income
	for Palestinians who lost their jobs as a result of the closure. It
	must also provide unemployment benefits
	to Palestinian workers who made payments to the Israeli National
	Insurance Institute
      	over the years.

<P>
 
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>T</B></FONT>
he undersigned human rights organizations are shocked and
saddened by the loss of life during the events of the past few
days, and we express our condolences to the bereaved families,
Israeli and Palestinian.
<P>
The opening of the tunnel in East Jerusalem is not the only cause
of these events; they broke out after frustration and bitterness
had built up among Palestinians as a result of Israeli actions in
the Occupied Territories over the years: closure, demolition of
houses, establishment and expansion of Jewish settlements,
massive administrative detentions, and use of torture. These
measures have led to Palestinians being unable to make a living,
restrictions on their freedom of movement, expropriation of their
land, and dependence of Palestinians on an infinite number of
"security permits."
<P>
We have repeatedly warned, and we warn once again, that violation
of human rights does not improve security, but rather is likely
to backfire and drive frustrated Palestinians to violence against
Israel. The recent events are tragic proof of the validity of
these forecasts.
<P>
These comments are not intended to justify any act of violence by
any party. We condemn the arbitrary use of force and attacks on
innocent persons on both sides. Rather, we make these comments to
indicate again the pressing and vital need to respect human
rights.
<P>


<CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>
WITHOUT RESPECT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS<BR>
NEITHER PEACE NOR SECURITY IS POSSIBLE
</B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<P>
Israeli human rights organizations urge the Israeli government
and the Palestinian Authority to:
<UL>
<LI>    act with restraint against demonstrators, and restrict the
use of firearms to life-threatening situations;
<P>
<LI>    investigate thoroughly the circumstances of the deaths that
occurred during the recent violence.
</UL>
We also urge the Israeli government to:
<UL>
<LI>    allow Palestinians freedom of movement throughout the
Occupied Territories;
<P>
<LI>    permit medical personnel to move freely throughout the
Occupied Territories at all times and in all situations;
<P>
<LI>    ensure sources of income for tens of thousands of
Palestinian workers who lost their income following the
closure, and enable operation of a properly functioning
economy;
<P>
<LI>    refrain from collective or extra-judicial punishment;
<P>
<LI>    respect the basic rights of detainees, and refrain from
arbitrary detention;
<P>
<LI>    release administrative detainees or bring them to trial ;
<P>
<LI>    cease expropriating land to build and expand Jewish
settlements, and refrain from demolishing houses; and
<P>
<LI>    refrain from deporting Palestinians from the Occupied
Territories.

     B'Tselem urges the Israeli government to direct its security forces
         to cease immediately the widescale use of live ammunition against Palestinian
         demonstrators, and to refrain from deploying large military forces in
         heavily populated areas in the Occupied Territories 

</B></FONT>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>I</B></FONT>
n a violent confrontation today in Ramallah, the IDF
reinstituted  a policy that failed  time and again and
led to bloodshed,  i.e. the policy of  deploying large
numbers of troops in heavily populated Palestinian
communities, and the widescale use of live ammunition.
<P>
Since implementation of the peace agreements began,  a
certain degree of separation between Israeli security
forces and  the Palestinians had developed, resulting in
a substantial reduction in the number of  casualties. The
actions taken by the security forces today will likely
cause the situation to deteriorate, and return
confrontation between them and the Palestinian population
to a level of violence reminiscent of  the intifada.
<P>
In handling the  recent  demonstrations of  ultra-
orthodox Jews,  the Minister for Public Security, Abraham
Kahalani,  urged police officers to act  with restraint,
and to refrain as much as possible from using force when
dispersing demonstrations. This policy must also be
implemented when dealing with Palestinians in the
Occupied Territories. Israelís security forces must act
in an unbiased manner when handling demonstrators,
giving no consideration to their nationality or religion.
<P>
BíTselem urges the Israeli government to prevent a repeat
of past errors, and to act moderately and responsibly.

B'Tselem  Calls on the Prime Minister: <BR> Cease  the  Abuses
Against Human Rights Activist Bashar Tarabieh
</B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>I</B></FONT>n  a  letter  sent today, B'Tselem called on  the  Prime
Minister,   Mr.   Benjamin  Netanyahu,   concerning   the
detention  of Bashar Tarabieh, a Golan Heights  resident.
Mr. Tarabieh, works and lives in the United States and is
married  to  a  U.S. citizen.  He has worked  on  various
projects for the international organization, Human Rights
Watch.
<P>
Mr. Tarabieh was detained on 19 August while visiting his
family  on  the Golan Heights.  Since then  he  has  been
detained  at  the  Kishon Detention Center,  near  Haifa.
According to information provided by Human Rights  Watch,
Mr. Tarabieh has been interrogated by the Israeli General
Security Service about his work for the organization. The
interrogators have tied his hands and legs  to  a  chair,
forced  him  to stay in painful positions for hours,  and
covered  his  head with a filthy sack. The interrogators,
have  also threatened to confiscate Mr. Tarabieh's travel
documents, preventing him from leaving Israel.  They have
also  called the work of organizations like Human  Rights
Watch and B'Tselem 'lies.'
<P>
The reports add that the GSS is holding Mr. Tarabieh in a
tiny  cell,  does  not  allow him  to  shower  or  change
clothes, and does not feed him regularly.
<P>
B'Tselem strongly opposes the detention of a human rights
activist,  and particularly the interrogation  about  the
activist's   work   on   behalf   of   a   human   rights
organization. Such interrogation constitutes
a  violation  of  the right to organize of  human  rights
organizations.  The detention and interrogation are clear
attempts  to  deter  such organizations  from  monitoring
human rights abuses by Israeli authorities.
<P>
Human  Rights  Watch is a widely respected  international
organization  which reports impartially on  human  rights
violations throughout the world.
<P>
In  its letter, B'Tselem calls on the Prime Minister, who
is responsible for the operations of the General Security
Service,  to  direct  the GSS to stop  interrogating  Mr.
Tarabieh  concerning his work as a human rights activist.
B'Tselem  further urges the Prime Minister to direct  the
GSS  not to use methods of interrogation like those  used
on  Mr.  Tarabieh, which are degrading and inhumane,  and
consequently prohibited by international law.
<P>
B'Tselem  further calls on the Prime Minister  to  direct
the  immediate release of Mr. Tarabieh in the event  that
no   evidence  has  been  found  linking  him  with   the
commission of a crime.
<P>

                 B'Tselem Calls on Netanyahu: <BR>
          New Hebron Plan Must Consider Human Rights

</B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>I</B></FONT>n  a  letter  sent  to  Prime  Minister  Binyamin  Netanyahu,
<B>B'Tselem</B>  urged  the Israeli government to consider  seriously
the  human rights implications of any alternative redeployment
plan for Hebron.
<P>
As the Netanyahu administration debates changes to the Oslo-II
agreement  regarding Hebron, <B>B'Tselem</B> reiterates the  findings
of  its September 1995 report, "Impossible Coexistence:  Human
Rights  in  Hebron  Since the Massacre  at  the  Cave  of  the
Patriarchs."
<P>
<B>B'Tselem</B> found that the presence of the IDF in Hebron  led  to
flagrant violations of the human rights of Palestinians in the
city,  including shootings, beatings, housing demolitions  and
restrictions  on  the freedom of movement  and  religion.   In
addition,  the  Israeli  authorities  failed  in  their  legal
responsibility to protect the lives, integrity and property of
Hebron's Palestinian residents from repeated attacks by Jewish
settlers.
<P>
The  letter to the Prime Minister reminds that, "Hebron,  like
all  Jewish settlements in the Occupied Territories,  violates
international law.  Furthermore, the massive military presence
necessary to protect a tiny minority of Jewish settlers living
amongst a Palestinian population of 160,000 caused severe  and
frequent violations of Palestinians' human rights."
<P>
<B>B'Tselem</B>  stands by its conclusion of eleven months  ago  that
the  only acceptable way to protect human rights in Hebron  is
"to  dismantle  the  Jewish settlement in  Hebron  and  remove
Israeli security forces from the city."  <B>B'Tselem</B> said at  the
time: "This solution does not constitute a political position;
its goal is to put an end to violations of Palestinians' human
rights  in Hebron, many of which result from the existence  of
Jewish settlement in the city.  Any settlement in the city and
Israeli control over the city, wholly or partially, will  lead
inevitably to additional violations of the human rights of the
city's  Palestinian  residents."  This conclusion  holds  true
today.
<P>
Any  plan  which increases the portion of the city  under  IDF
control would not only fail to improve human rights in Hebron,
but  in  the city's explosive climate could drastically worsen
the  situation.   <B>B'Tselem</B> urged the  Prime  Minister  not  to
accept any plan which would compromise the human rights of any
resident of Hebron.
<P>

5617-271/4.

B'Tselem calls upon the Palestinian Authority to Release Muhammad Dahman,  Gaza Director of the Addameer Association and to Respect the Freedom of Speech and Association of Human Rights Organizations
</B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>I</B></FONT>
n a letter to Khaled al-Qidra, General Prosecutor of the Palestinian Authority, B'Tselem urges the release of Muhammad Dahman, Gaza Director of the Addameer Prisoners Support Association.  Addameer is an organization which provides legal assistance to Palestinian political prisoners and detainees held by both Israeli and Palestinian authorities.
<P>
Muhammad Dahman was arrested from his home in Gaza on the night of 12 August by the <I>Mukhabarat</I> (Palestinian intelligence).  He is being detained for 48 hours at the Soria prison in Gaza on suspicion of publishing wrong information concerning the death of Nahed Dahalan.  Dahman was detained following the publication of a statement by Addameer which states that Nahed Dahalan was found dead near his house on 7 August, 1996 after being summoned for nightly interrogation sessions over the course of several days.  Addameer called on the Palestinian Authority to investigate the circumstances of Dahalan's death.
<P>
Dahman's attorney, Raji Sourani, has been informed that Dahman will be tried by the State Security Court.  The proceedings of this court do not meet the minimum standards for a fair trial.
<P>
Mr. Dahman is the fourth Palestinian human rights activist to be detained by the Palestinian Authority following the voicing of criticism of the PA's human rights practices.  Raji Sourani, then director of the Gaza Center for Rights and Law, and Bassem 'Eid, then fieldworker for B'Tselem, were both detained for 24 hours and subsequently released uncharged.  Dr. Iyad Sarraj, Commissioner General of the Palestinian Independent Commission for Citizens Rights, has been detained three times in the past year.  Most recently, Dr. Sarraj was held for 12 days, forcefully interrogated and charged with drug possession and assaulting a police officer.  These detentions indicate a pattern in which the Palestinian Authority intimidates and silences its critics rather than addressing the substance of their allegations.
<P>
In its letter to al-Qidra, B'Tselem emphasizes the vital role which Palestinian human rights activists have to play in building a Palestinian society governed by human dignity and the rule of law.  However, their ability to fulfil this role is severely impaired if they are not free to monitor, document and criticize without fear of personal reprisal.
<P>
B'Tselem regards the detention of human rights activists with the utmost concern.  The detention of Dahman represents a violation of free speech and freedom of association.  B'Tselem calls on the Palestinian Authority to cease its attacks on human rights organizations and activists.

B'Tselem Urges International Community to Bring Ehud Yatom to Justice
</B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+2>B'</FONT>Tselem</B> today called upon human rights 
organizations around the world to demand that any state in which Ehud Yatom 
is present arrest and institute criminal proceedings against him. The request 
follows the admission of Yatom, former senior officer of the Israeli General 
Security Service (GSS), that he killed Subhi and Majdi Abu Jamea, two of the 
Palestinians who hijacked an Israeli bus in 1984 in the "Bus 300 Incident." 
<P>
This is the first time that <B>B'Tselem</B> has requested foreign countries to 
detain an Israeli official.  It decided to take this unprecedented action 
because Yatom cannot be held accountable inside Israel due to the sweeping 
pardon granted to him and other GSS agents by then-Israeli President 
Mr. Haim Herzog for "crimes relating to the so-called 300 bus incident," 
and the upholding of the pardon by the High Court of Justice.
<P>
The entire handling of the "Bus 300 incident" remains a mark of shame upon 
the State of Israel.  The excessive tolerance that all governmental 
authorities - GSS heads, the Israeli government, the President, and the 
High Court of Justice - demonstrated towards the crimes committed by Yatom 
and his GSS associates perpetuates the view that Israel's security justifies 
the taking of human life and the disregard of the rule of law. This 
forgiveness is illustrated not only by the pardon granted to Yatom and 
others exempting them from criminal prosecution for murder, whitewashing 
of facts, and fabrication of evidence, but also in the promotion of Yatom 
within the GSS to the equivalent of the military rank of general.
<P>
As an Israeli human rights organization, <B>B'Tselem</B> believes it unacceptable 
that a person proudly claiming to have committed premeditated murder walks 
freely within Israeli society. Yatom's contention that he performed this act 
"with permission and authority" recalls the most loathsome regimes that 
justified committing heinous crime on the grounds of following orders.
<P>
Yatom's statements, as reported by <I>Yediot Aharonot</I> on 26 July 1996, also raise the fear that the murder he committed, upon the orders of the then-head of the GSS, was not exceptional, but rather among the accepted norms of conduct of the GSS. This fear is reinforced by the arguments of then-Attorney General Joseph Harish during the hearing before the High Court of Justice.  In explaining the government's interest in maintaining the confidentiality of the entire affair, Harish argued that GSS agents were threatening to reveal other such incidents, saying "we won't have any choice, and then we shall defend ourselves and tell everything from day one."   
<P>
Against the background of these statements, the lack of a public and unequivocal condemnation by the current Prime Minister and the head of the GSS of the murder carried out by Yatom and an assertion that Israel opposes such actions is liable to give the impression to Israeli society as a whole and security personnel in particular that murder "with permission and authority" is allowed.
<P>
Yatom's acts, which by his own admission include crushing the heads of Subhi and Majdi Abu Jamea with a large stone, fall within the definition of torture according to the United Nation's Convention against Torture.  According to <B>B'Tselem</B>, Yatom can be arrested and tried abroad on the basis of this Convention, which obligates states-parties to take into custody any person alleged to have committed torture and to ensure that criminal or extradition proceedings are instigated against him.  As of 1 May 1996, 96 countries are a party to this convention, including Israel, the United States, and all states of Western Europe.  Yatom's actions also constitute a blatant example of state sanctioned extrajudicial execution, which is a violation of customary international law.
<P>
In addition to its appeal to the international community,  <B>B'Tselem</B> urges the 
Israeli government to take the following measures in order to uproot the 
phenomenon of murder, torture, and other human rights violations by security 
forces:
<UL>
<LI> Ensure that Ehud Yatom does not serve in any public position;
<LI> Indicate publicly and unequivocally that the government of 
     Israel will severely punish anyone who, in the name of ensuring 
     State security, commits patently illegal and immoral acts;
<LI> Initiate legislation stipulating that persons who commit extra-judicial 
     execution, "disappearances," torture, and other gross violations of 
     human rights may not benefit from legal or administrative measures 
     that absolve them from criminal responsibility.
</UL>
Granting preventive immunity or subsequent pardon to members of the security forces is a primary cause of the continuation of human rights violations.  So long as persons who commit gross violations of human rights are allowed to kill and torture with impunity and with no threat of being held accountable for their actions, such crimes are liable to continue.

<FONT SIZE=+3><I> Press Release - August 6, 1996 </I></FONT>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>In a letter to the Minister of Internal Security, B'Tselem argues that 
closing the investigation file against Border Police undercover agents 
who killed Daud Shweiki is liable to encourage use of unjustified deadly 
gunfire.
<P>
In 13 files monitored by B'Tselem of killings by Border Police undercover 
units, 12 were closed with no indictments being issued.
</FONT></B>
<HR>
<P>

<B><FONT SIZE=+2>I</FONT></B>n his letter to <B>B'Tselem</B> of 4 August 1996, Mr. Eran Shender, head of the 
Ministry of Justice's Department for the Investigation of Police Officers, 
indicated that the investigation file against Border Police officers who shot 
and killed Daud Shweiki in Ras-al-Amud, East Jerusalem, on 6 June 1996, was 
"closed due to absence of fault."
<P>
According to Shender, the investigation's findings indicate that "an 
unfortunate and tragic combination of circumstances occurred in which those 
injured thought a car was being stolen, while the police officers believed 
that the men were terrorists." In conclusion, Shender wrote: "after 
considering the circumstances of the incident in all its aspects, I reached 
the conclusion that the officer who fired the shot did not commit any 
criminal act."
<P>
Following receipt of Shender's letter, <B>B'Tselem</B> requested that the Department 
for the Investigation of Police Officers allow it to review the investigation 
file.
<P>
On 6 June 1996, about 2:00 a.m., Border Police Undercover Unit officers shot 
Daud Shweiki, 28, director of maintenance services at Jerusalem's Laromme 
Hotel.  Shweiki died as a result of the shooting, which occurred near his 
home in East Jerusalem. His brother, Muhammad Shweiki, 18, was injured by 
the gunfire. 
<P>
<B>B'Tselem</B>'s investigation shows that the Shweiki family noticed a transit 
van with civilian license plates approaching their home. The driver parked 
the vehicle nearby and turned out the lights. Since someone had broken into 
their car the previous night, the Shweikis thought that the persons in the 
vehicle intended to break into their car. 
<P>
The Shweiki brothers, Daud, Wahaba, and Muhammad, and their father, Ya'qub 
Shweiki,  approached the parked transit van.  In their testimony to <B>B'Tselem</B>, 
Wahaba and Muhammad Shweiki stated that as they moved unarmed towards the 
vehicle, shots were fired at them from inside the vehicle, striking Daud and 
Muhammad.  Daud died from bullet wounds to his head and chest, and Muhammad 
was wounded in the hand and chest.
<P>
In his testimony to <B>B'Tselem</B>, the father noted that neither Muhammad nor 
Daud were armed or had any object in their hands which might have been 
mistaken for a weapon. He gave similar testimony to the police.
<P>
According to statistics compiled by <B>B'Tselem</B>, since the beginning of the 
Intifada, Border Police and IDF undercover units have killed 159 Palestinians 
by gunfire; 29 of these deaths occurred since the signing of the Oslo Accords. 
Of the 13 investigations into deaths by gunfire of Border Police undercover 
units, 12 were closed. <B>B'Tselem</B> has not received a response to its inquiry 
about the remaining file.
<P>
<B>B'Tselem</B> believes that the methods used by undercover units create a 
substantial likelihood that innocent persons will be injured. When 
security forces disguise their identity and carry deadly weapons into 
populated areas, the danger exists that an "unfortunate and tragic 
combination of circumstances" will occur, just as it did in Ras-al-Amud. 
By using these methods, undercover unit personnel knowingly endanger their 
lives, requiring them at times to use their weapons. Under such circumstances, 
the argument that the use of deadly gunfire was an act of self-defense is 
not persuasive.
<P>
<B>B'Tselem</B> believes that the decision to close this file sends a message to 
security forces that while the hasty and irresponsible use of gunfire against 
Palestinians may not be intended, it also is not unacceptable behavior for 
which punishment can be expected. This message is both immoral and illegal. 
The police and judicial authorities must repeatedly clarify to police 
officers their obligations in circumstances like those that the Border 
Police faced in this case.

Fear of Torture to Death by Palestinian Authority
</B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>


<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Y</B></FONT>esterday, 30 July 1996, Mahmud Jamal Jumaiel, 
aged 26, hospitalized on 26 July at the government hospital in Ramallah 
after being held in detention by the Palestinian Coastal Police, was 
pronounced clinically brain dead. 
<P>
Jumaiel had been arrested in December, 1995 by the Palestinian Police and
interrogated about his activities on behalf of the "Fatah Hawks".  Since 
then he was detained in Jericho without legal actions being taken against 
him. Several times during his detention, Jumaiel went on hunger strikes to 
demand his release.
<P>
On the night of 26 July, Palestinian authorities informed Jumaiel's family 
that he had been transferred to the Palestinian Authority's Coastal Police 
Section at the Juneid Prison, in Nablus.  A few hours later he was admitted 
to Rafidiyye Hospital, in Ramallah, under a pseudonym, and was then 
transferred to the government hospital where physicians yesterday pronounced 
him clinically brain dead.
<P>
B'Tselem fieldworker, Bassem 'Eid, who visited Jumaiel yesterday at 
the hospital, saw marks of severe beating over Jumaiel's entire body, 
as well as burn marks on his chest.  'Eid spoke with Jumaiel's relatives, 
who stated that they had visited him on 26 July in Jericho, before he was 
brought to Juneid Prison, and that he was in good health at the time.
<P>
B'Tselem urges the Palestinian Authority to investigate the matter quickly 
and thoroughly to determine the circumstances of the injuries suffered by 
Mahmud Jumaiel, and to indict those responsible.
<P>
Additionally, B'Tselem urges the Palestinian Authority to issue directives 
preventing the use of torture and ill treatment during interrogation of 
suspects, and to open detention facilities to periodic visits by human 
rights organizations.

Reported Mistreatment of Dr. Eyad Sarraj: <BR>
B'Tselem Appeals to the European Union and
Requests to Meet With Dr. Sarraj in Detention</B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>


<FONT SIZE=+2><B>R</B></FONT>ecent information obtained by B'Tselem suggests that Dr. Eyad 
Sarraj, Commissioner General of the Palestinian Independent Commission for Citizens' Rights, 
has been subjected to physical violence in his detention by the Palestinian Authority and may 
be in danger.  Dr. Sarraj reportedly managed to smuggle a message out of detention last night 
which stated that he had been beaten and fears for his safety.  The note also stated that his 
interrogators were attempting to elicit a confession from him for drug offenses.
<P>
B'Tselem sent an urgent letter to Mr. Enrico Nardi, Consul General of Italy, which holds the 
European Union Presidency, urging him to take immediate steps to secure Dr. Sarraj's safe 
release.
<P>
B'Tselem, together with six other Israeli human rights organizations, also sent a letter to 
Palestinian Attorney General Khaled Al-Kidra, requesting to meet with Dr. Sarraj in detention. 
The organizations are HaMoked: Center for the Defense of the Individual, Physicians for Human 
Rights, the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel, Defense of Children International, 
Rabbis for Human Rights and the Workers Hotline.
<P>
Dr. Sarraj is a well-known and longstanding human rights activist who has been vocal in his 
criticisms of the Palestinian Authority.  This is his third detention by the Palestinian 
Authority in the past six months.  B'Tselem is concerned that the Palestinian Authority may 
attempt to convict him on trumped up charges in order to silence his outspoken human rights 
advocacy.
<P>
B'Tselem took steps in response to the danger to Dr. Sarraj's safety and the lack of response 
from the Palestinian Authority to its prior appeals on Dr. Sarraj's behalf. In addition to 
its concerns about Dr. Sarraj as an individual, the freedom of human rights activists to 
operate in safety is a necessary condition for the creation of a just and democratic society. 
Palestinians cannot hope to enjoy basic rights if human rights advocates cannot speak out 
freely without fear of personal reprisals.

                       B'Tselem Calls on Israel:<BR>
     Stop Bombing Civilian Settlements and Infrastructure in Lebanon <BR>
                Allow Residents to Return to their Homes
</B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>


<FONT SIZE=+2><B>I</B></FONT>n a letter sent to Prime Minister and Defense Minister Shimon Peres, B'Tselem urged the
Israeli government to cease immediately the shelling and bombing of settlements and civilian
infrastructure in Lebanon, and to enable the residents to return to their homes, from which
the IDF evacuated them.  B'Tselem said that it is aware of Israel's obligation to protect its
citizens as a result of recent events in northern Israel, and condemns the Hizballah shelling
of the Galilee.  However, the letter stated, a state must not take measures that severely harm
hundreds of thousands of persons who are not involved in any violent activity.
<P>
B'Tselem is an information center that documents human rights in the Occupied Territories,
and does not generally deal with Israel's activities in other areas. However, it said, it cannot
remain silent while basic rights of Lebanese citizens are being violated as a result of IDF activity.
<P>
The shelling and bombing of populated areas in Lebanon for some seven days has already
left dozens of local residents dead and hundreds wounded. The recent forced evacuation of
southern Lebanese towns and villages has turned thousands of persons into refugees, with all
the suffering that refugee status entails.  As Shimon Peres wrote in The New Middle East:
"No reasonable human being can remain indifferent to the plight of refugees ... men, women
and children fleeing in fear of their lives, with terror in their eyes and despair in their faces..."
(page 181). 
<P>
A fundamental principle of international law is that all parties to an armed conflict must distinguish
between military and civilian targets, and must not harm civilians.  In case of uncertainty
regarding a specific object, international law requires that the site be considered civilian.  During
the widescale evacuation of entire areas in southern Lebanon, the IDF proclaimed that Lebanese
residents who remain "do so on their own personal responsibility, and at the risk of their lives."
In spite of this declaration, Israel cannot shirk its obligation to refrain from acts that may injure
civilians.
<P>
Notwithstanding official statements, it appears that Israel is not refraining from attacking civilian
targets, particularly property and public infrastructure.  A notable example is the shelling of
the electric power station in Beirut a few days ago.  According to Peres, "the Hizballah damaged
the supply of electricity in Kiryat Shmonah, and we damaged the supply of electricity in Beirut."
Reprisals against civilians are explicitly prohibited by international law, and B'Tselem urged
Mr. Peres to order their immediate cessation.

Re: House Demolition
<P>
The High Court of Justice rejected the appeals of the families
of those who plan and conducted bombing attacks inside Israel. 
The Court ruled that the families' houses can be demolished.  This
decision removes the final legal barrier to the demolitions which
may begin tomorrow.
<P>
In spite of the legal sanction provided by the High Court, we
urgently appeal to you to reconsider execution of the demolitions.
<P>
B'Tselem recognizes Israel's right, indeed its obligation, to ensure
the security of its citizens.  However, demolishing the houses
of innocent Palestinians, including children, solely for their
relationship to those who conducted attacks is a blatant violation
of their human rights and in contradiction of international law.
<P>
Since the beginning of the intifada, 400 houses of Palestinians
have been demolished in the territories as a punitive measure.
However, this collective punishment did not cause a cessation of
the attacks.
<P>
Punishment of the innocent, as proven in the past, does not increase
Israel's security and violates the central moral principle that
"a child shall not be held responsible for the offenses of the
parent, nor the parent for the child."
<P>

An Open letter to Participants in the Sharm-a-Sheikh Summit <BR>
<I> The War Against Terrorism: Not At the Expense of Human Rights </I>
</B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>B'</B></FONT>Tselem calls on all governments participating in the international summit at Sharm-a-Sheikh,
and in particular on Israel, to express their commitment to human rights and the rule of law,
alongside their strong denunciations of terrorism.  In the framework of the international struggle
against terrorism, all conference participants should unequivocally reject all measures which
constitute violations of basic human rights.
<P>
B'Tselem recognizes Israel's need to take defensive measures to ensure the security of its citizens,
as well as measures intended to prevent additional bomb attacks. However, B'Tselem strongly
condemns Israel's use of measures following the latest bombings which constitute blatant violations
of the human rights of Palestinians in the occupied territories.  These measures include detentions
of family members of suicide bombers and demolition of their homes, curfews and closures
of cities and villages, shutting down educational institutions and administrative detentions. 
<P>
The prolonged closure imposed on the territories, as well as the internal closure declared on
all population centers in the West Bank, cause extreme hardship for the entire Palestinian
population of the territories.  The closure prevents medical personnel from reaching hospitals,
as well as preventing the critically ill from receiving treatment - and has already resulted in
the death of two people.  It also causes an increasing shortage of food and medical supplies,
especially in the Gaza Strip.  Many Palestinians have lost their source of employment and
suffer from economic hardship.  The stringent restrictions on movement separate husbands
and wives, and parents and children.
<P>
B'Tselem calls on the Israeli government to immediately cease those measures which constitute
collective punishment or extrajudicial punishment.  The principle that every person is responsible
for his or her actions and no one should be punished for the actions of another constitutes
a basic tenet of both Israeli and international law.  The use of punitive measures against innocent
Palestinians solely for their relationship to those who conduct attacks or their residence in
the same village is inherently amoral and contradicts the most fundamental legal principles. 
B'Tselem also calls on the Israeli government not to apply pressure on the Palestinian Authority
to take measures which result in human rights violations.
<P>
Moreover, the use of measures against Palestinians such as deportation and house demolition
constitutes discrimination on the basis of nationality; after Israelis conducted acts of terror,
the Israeli authorities did not consider taking measures against members of their family - and
rightly so - such as deportation or demolition of their houses.
<P>
According to the authorities, measures such as deportation and house demolition are necessary
in order to deter potential terrorists.  However, the use of security considerations to justify
serious violations of human rights opens the door for unlimited abuses of these rights. 
International law has formulated the legitimate boundaries of government action in all situations,
including states of emergency.
<P>
In addition, in spite of repeated declarations, the connection between the extended use of collective
punishments in the territories over the years and a decrease in violence has never been established. 
The Chief Military Prosecutor at the height of the intifada, Amnon Strashnov, claimed that
the effectiveness of house demolitions as a deterrent "has not been decisively proven in any
kind of empirical study.  Acts of terror continued, it is known, in spite of the house demolitions."
<P>
The lack of proof of their effectiveness creates the impression that the authorities engage in
such highly visible measures as house demolition in order to pacify the Israeli public and
demonstrate that it deals severely with acts of terror.  These are illegitimate motivations for
the use of punitive measures.
<P>
Israel's commitment to respect human rights is proven precisely in times of crisis.  B'Tselem
calls on the government of Israel to respect the basic values of law and morality also at this
time.

     Israeli Human Rights Organizations Condemn the Brutal Attacks. <BR>
          Collective Punishments, However, Are Not the Answer.
</B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>W</B></FONT>e, the undersigned Israeli human rights organizations, are outraged at the brutal
attacks inside Israel against innocent people.  We strongly condemn these acts, which
blatantly contradict the basic principles of human rights.  They cannot be justified
by any circumstances of occupation, deprivation or suffering.
<P>
It is the right and the responsibility of the Government of Israel to protect its
citizens and to prevent additional attacks, by taking all possible measures which
conform with Israel's obligations to respect human rights and uphold international law
and the conventions to which it is a signatory.
<P>
In the past few days, the Israeli government has declared its intention to implement a
series of measures in the wake of the attacks, some of which constitute collective
punishment and will result in serious violation of the human rights of Palestinians in
the territories.  These measures, some of which have already been implemented, include
sealing and demolition of houses, imposition of curfew and closure on communities and
administrative detentions.
<P>
The principle that every person is responsible for his or her actions and no one
should be punished for the actions of another constitutes a basic principle of both
Israeli and international law.  Those who plan and conduct attacks must be brought to
justice;  there is no justification, however, for implementing punitive measures
against innocent Palestinians - including Palestinians who are shocked and disgusted
by the acts of terror.
<P>
Collective punishments such as the prolonged closure imposed on the territories, and
the curfew that has been declared in many communities, cause severe distress for the
entire Palestinian population in the territories.  The closure prevents patients in
critical condition from receiving treatment, and prevents doctors from reaching
hospitals.  It is also causing an increasingly serious shortage of food and essential
medical supplies in the Gaza Strip.  The stringent restrictions on travel separates
spouses, and parents and children, and prevents establishment of normal family life.
<P>
We call upon the government of Israel not to ignore its obligation to ensure
employment opportunities for Palestinian workers who are prevented from entering
Israel due to the closure, as well as to allow free movement to specific groups of
Palestinians, such as medical personnel and the sick.
<P>
We call upon the Israeli Government to act with reason even in these times of profound
pain and anger, and to uphold the basic values of law and morality.  Experience
demonstrates that illegal and immoral sweeping punitive measures do not reduce acts of
terror and are even liable to increase the support these acts receive.

Israeli human rights organizations - the Israel Section of Defense
of Children International, B'Tselem, The Public Committee Against

IDF and the Police conduct an investigation into the murder of 
prisoners in Israeli prison facilities.
</I>
<HR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>H</B></FONT>uman rights organizations express profound outrage at the most
recent death of a Palestinian prisoner in an IDF prison facility.
<P>
'Adel Yusuf Ash'hatit, 21 years old from Dura in the Hebron District,
died in the Megiddo military prison, apparently on Thursday, February
15, 1996.  Media reports indicate that prisoners with whom Ash'hatit
was held are suspected in his death.
<P>
This is the second recent death at Megiddo prison.  On February
1 of this year, 'Abd a-Rahman 'Omar Salim Zid Kilani, 21 years
old from Ya'bed was murdered.  Prior to these two deaths, four
Palestinian prisoners died similar deaths in the Ketziot military
detention facility.
<P>
As stated above, these deaths took place in Israeli military
detention facilities, located inside Israel.  Therefore, the wardens
of these facilities bear sole responsibility for ensuring the safety
and well-being of the prisoners, according to Israeli law.
<P>
Section 322 of the Israeli Penal Code 5737-1977, entitled
"Responsibility for the Helpless" states: "Whosoever bears
responsibility for a person who, because of his age . . . detention
or any other reason, cannot divest himself of that responsibility
and cannot provide life's necessities for himself or provide for
his health needs . . . it is incumbent upon him to provide his
requirements for sustenance, to take care of his health, and to
consider him as one who has caused results concerning the person's
life or health because he did not fulfill his said obligation."
<P>
We demand that the prison wardens and those responsible within
the IDF immediately take the steps necessary to prevent the
occurrence of additional such incidents.  In addition, we demand
that Military Police Investigations and the Israel Police investigate
these incidents of death, in light of the details stated above,
in order to identify those suspected of causing the deaths and
those who bear responsibility for them.
<P>
We also call upon Palestinian organizations to work to end these
phenomenon.

<HR>
<I>Human rights organizations - B'Tselem, HaMoked: Center
for the Defense of the Individual, the Association of
Physicians for Human Rights and the Public Committee
Against Torture in Israel - condemn today's decision
of the High Court of Justice, which permits the use of
torture against Palestinian detainee, Abed el-Halim
Balbisi.</I>
<HR>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>T</B></FONT>oday, for the first time in its history, the High Court of Justice
permitted the General Security Service (GSS) to use physical
pressure, including forceful shaking, against a Palestinian detainee.
<P>
This permission was granted when the High Court cancelled the interim
injunction it had granted in the case of the detainee, Abed el-Halim
Balbisi.  This injunction prohibited the use of any physical force
against the detainee during his interrogation.  For all intents
and purposes, today's decision by the High Court gives the GSS
permission to employ measures against the detainee which constitute
torture.
<P>
In fact, the case of Balbisi refutes the claim of the authorities
that effective interrogation requires the use of physical force. 
The detainee provided important information, according to the GSS,
without being subjected to torture.
<P>
Balbisi was detained on 6 December 1995 and held by the GSS.  For
a period of 18 days he was subjected to an interrogation in which
physical force, including violent shaking, were used against him. 
<P>
Following a High Court appeal filed on Balbisi's behalf by attorney
Andre Rosenthal, the High Court issued an interim injunction which
prohibited the GSS from using physical force against Balbisi during
his interrogation.  After a few days, in which he was not subjected
to torture, the detainee provided information (according to the
GSS) which led to the discovery of an explosive device buried in
January 1995 in order to carry out the attack at the Beit Lid
junction during that month.
<P>
Forceful shaking of the head and body by GSS interrogators has
already caused the death of a Palestinian detainee - Abed a-Samed
Harizat in April 1995.  Following Harizat's death, the expert
forensic pathologist, Dr. Robert Kirschner, determined that
interrogation by forceful shaking carries a high risk of serious
and irreversible brain damage, as well as death.
<P>
The decision of the High Court supports the attempt of the
authorities to bestow institutional legitimacy on the use of torture
during interrogations of Palestinians.  
<P>
This decision contradicts the International Convention Against
Torture, which the Israeli Government has declared its intention
to incorporate into law.
<P>
Human rights organizations condemn this decision, which contradicts
international law, the Israeli Penal Code and the Basic Law: Human
Dignity and Freedom, and violates basic human rights concerning
dignity and bodily integrity.

<B>B'Tselem's response to the proposed GSS Law: 
   Torture Under Law - Only in Israel
</B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>T</B></FONT>he proposed General Security Service Law, as reported by the media, incorporates into law
the use of torture and perpetuates the existing condition, in which torture of Palestinians during
interrogations is systematic. 
<P>
B'Tselem welcomes the initiative to codify GSS powers, but it is wrong to exploit this initiative
to provide a cloak of legality on the use of torture. Allowing GSS interrogators to use violent
means during interrogations removes the taboo on causing harm to a person or his dignity,
and legitimizes such injuries, leaving the suspect defenseless.
<P>
If the proposed law is enacted, Israel would be the only country in the world in which
the use of torture during interrogations is allowed by law.
<P>
The  proposed law ostensibly prohibits torture, and only allows "the use of pressure" on suspects.
A similar distinction appears explicitly in the recommendations of the Landau Commission,
which allowed the use of "moderate" physical pressure only. However, prolonged experience
indicates that the use of pressure on suspects constitutes torture for all intents and purposes,
and any attempt to distinguish between permitted pressure and prohibited pressure failed utterly.
The attempt to distinguish between cases in which pressure is permitted and those in which
it was prohibited failed, and in most cases the suspects were tortured, though they were not
tortured under the criteria that had been set.
<P>
Numerous testimonies given to B'Tselem during its seven years of activity indicate that GSS
interrogators, when interrogating suspects, use violence constituting torture even when the
evidence against them is minimal; according to the late Prime Minister and Defense Minister,
Yitzhak Rabin, 8,000 Palestinians were "shaken" in GSS interrogations. Furthermore, most
of the tortured suspects were ultimately released without any legal measures being taken against
them. In almost every instance, the purpose of the use of torture during interrogations has
been to obtain confessions concerning past crimes, and not to obtain information about planned
attacks.
<P>
In effect, the proposed law is designed to incorporate into law the recommendation of the Landau
Commission to allow the use of "a moderate degree of physical pressure" on suspects. These
permitted measures have been implemented although they clearly violate the Penal Law, which
prohibits a public official from using force or violence against a person for the purpose of
extorting from him, or from anyone in whom he is interested, a confession of an offense or
information relating to an offense. The proposed law is the next stage of legitimizing torture
in Israel.
<P>
According to the proposed law, the measures GSS interrogators may use during interrogations
will be set forth in secret rules that will be made by the Prime Minister, upon approval of
the Cabinet Committee and the Knesset Committee for GSS Matters. B'Tselem rejects the
principle of secrecy of the permitted means of pressure. Secrecy will prevent meaningful public
and judicial criticism of the legality of the means. Undisclosed legislation that stipulates what
the interrogator is allowed and prohibited from doing is inherently unacceptable and emasculates
the important initiative of  incorporating GSS activities into law.
<P>
Together with other human rights groups, B'Tselem is undertaking a public campaign to prevent
the enactment of a law that critically harms the rule of law in Israel. B'Tselem urges the Israeli
government to amend the proposed law, delete any measure that permits the use of pressure
on suspects under interrogation, and end, in accord with its international obligations, the current
widespread use of torture and cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment. In addition, B'Tselem
urges the government to pass legislation that requires publication of the permitted measures.

B'Tselem Fieldworker Bassem 'Eid Released From His Detention in Ramallah
</B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>I</B></FONT>n spite of the denials of officials within the Palestinian
Authority that B'Tselem Fieldworker Bassem 'Eid was being
detained and held by the PA, 'Eid was released this evening
from detention by the Authority in Ramallah.
<P>
'Eid was held for 24 hours.  He was not interrogated nor was
he told the reason for his detention.  Throughout this period,
officials of the Authority denied the fact that he was
detained and claimed that he was not being held by any of the
Palestinian security forces.
<P>
'Eid's detention is a blatant example of an increasingly
prevalent pattern in which the Palestinian Authority silences
and discourages anyone who voices public criticism rather than
address the substance of the criticism.  Equally serious is
the denials which, in this case, are intended to generate
uncertainty and to increase the concern for 'Eid's well-being.

B'Tselem Fieldworker, Bassem 'Eid, Detained by Palestinian Police
</B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Y</B></FONT>esterday at 11 p.m., a Palestinian police officer came to the
home of B'Tselem fieldworker Bassem 'Eid and requested 'Eid to
accompany him to Ramallah for questioning. 
<P>
This morning 'Eid notified B'Tselem that he is being detained in
Ramallah at the headquarters of "Force 17". He added that he has
not yet been interrogated and has not been told the reason for
his detention. A strong suspicion exists that 'Eid was arrested
because of the harsh criticism he has voiced in his work at B'Tselem
and for the international human rights organization Reporters sans
Frontieres concerning actions of the Palestinian Authority.
<P>
'Eid was one of the authors of a report B'Tselem published in August,
1995 dealing with human rights violations by the Preventive Security
Service of the Palestinian Authority. In responding to the report,
Gibril Rajoub, head of the PSS, proclaimed that 'Eid is "an Israeli
agent."
<P>
Recently 'Eid has followed the matter of the detention of the editor
of Al-Quds, Maher 'Al-Alami, by the PSS.
<P>
B'Tselem views the detention of 'Eid a serious breach of the freedom
of activity of a human rights organization, and calls on the
Palestinian Authority to release him immediately. B'Tselem considers
the Palestinian Authority responsible for the health and safety
of Bassem 'Eid.

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>
Tortured to Death at Ketziot
</B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>T</B></FONT>estimonies given to B'Tselem show that during August-October of
1995, a group of prisoners severely tortured dozens of prisoners.
The group members accused the interrogees of collaborating with
Israeli authorities, and coerced them into confessing to patently
false allegations.
<P>
During this period, two prisoners at Ketziot died, apparently as
a result of torture - Abd al-Karim Abd Al-Ghani Kanaze', 26 years
old, who died on 15 September 1995, and Muhammad Musa Abd a-Razeq
Abu-Shakra, 23 years old, who died on 7 October 1995. 
<P>
Among the methods of torture mentioned in the testimonies are the
following: 
Extinguishing cigarettes on the bodies of interrogees, laying
them on a board with nails while interrogators sat on them,
cutting the interrogees with knives and pouring salt on the
wounds, dripping molten plastic on their bodies, and inserting
electric wire and other objects into their penises.
<P>
"A.B."<SUP>*</SUP>, in his testimony to a B'Tselem fieldworker, stated:
<UL>
     On the first day of interrogation they undressed me
     completely, lay me on a board full of nails, sometimes with
     my chest on the nails, and at other times with my back lying
     on the nails and then they would sit on me... They would
     heat the plastic trays we used when eating until they
     melted, and they dripped the molten plastic on my penis. The
     pain was terrible.
</UL>
"D.H."<SUP>*</SUP> testified:
<UL>
     They inserted wire into my penis... They beat me all the
     time.. They used to douse the wounds of interrogees with
     salt and pepper after they cut them with a razor blade. 
</UL>
According to the testimonies, the prison authorities did not
intervene. This fact raises grave concern in the light of the
large number of prisoners tortured as well as the large number of
persons involved (the interrogators who perpetrated the torture
and the passive eye-witnesses) and the prolonged period over
which these incidents occurred. Indeed, the testimonies indicate
that the authorities knew, at least partially, about the torture.
They obviously were aware of the acts being perpetrated in the
prison facility after the two prisoners died as a result of the
violence inflicted on them. 
<P>
According to the testimonies, the entire group of those who
conducted the interrogations and torture was released in the
framework of the prisoner release under the Oslo II Agreement.
Munjad Kazaz, who was the head of the group, told the interrogees
that he was a member of the Palestinian Preventive Security
Service, headed by Gibril Rajoub. After his release he was
appointed to a senior position in the Preventive Security
Service. 
<P>
B'Tselem has sent urgent letters to the Minister of Defense, Mr.
Shimon Peres, and to the Chairman of the Palestinian Authority,
Mr. Yasser Arafat, demanding that the matter be investigated and
that those responsible for the torture and for the failure to
ensure the safety of the prisoners be punished. Copies of the
letters are enclosed.
<P>
* The names of the witnesses are on file at B'Tselem.

</CENTER>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>B'</B></FONT>Tselem has released a report documenting violent and degrading searches
which took place in ten Palestinian apartments in Hebron.  Testimonies given
to B'Tselem by persons residing in the apartments raise two disturbing
phenomena:
<OL>
<LI>  Strip Searches of Women: The security forces forced fifteen Palestinian
women, ranging in age from 20 to 69, to undress from head to toe in the
presence of women soldiers and/or policewomen. In two instances, women were
required to undress in full vision of a male police officer.  Thirteen
children, aged one month to 14 years old, were also undressed.  In some
cases, women were compelled to undress in front of their relatives, their
children and other children.  Screams, curses, and beatings accompanied the
order to undress in several cases.  Although men were also present in most
of the apartments, only one man was also required to undress.
<P>
<LI> Threats, Violence and Property Damage: During the house searches, the
security forces broke furniture and utensils, dumped food on the floor, and
tore mattresses, clothes and pictures.  In some of the instances, the
security forces threatened family members. One soldier threatened to kill a
woman's two-year-old daughter if the mother did not move away from the
window, and in another case, a woman soldier threatened to kill a woman if
she did not reveal information about her husband.
</OL>
The fact that only women and children were ordered to undress, while in
every case but one the men were not required to undergo this degradation,
indicates that this measure was taken to humiliate the women and their
families.  This together with the contemptuous and violent treatment of the
residents and their property, and the fact that almost none of the residents
were detained reinforce the suspicion that the violence and degradation were
intentional and totally unrelated to security needs.
<P>
This report is written a short time after exposure of the Border Police's
abuse of Palestinians at the A-Ram checkpoint. Following this incident,
security force officials stated the need to eradicate the phenomenon of ill
treatment. While these declarations were being made, soldiers and police
were abusing women and children in Hebron. These acts raise doubts about the
intention of those officials to act seriously in this matter.  B'Tselem
urges the Israeli government to end this conduct:
<OL>
<LI> The government must unequivocally instruct its security forces not to
order women to undress, and not to offend their honor in any other way; the
government must instruct its security forces that during house searches,
they must safeguard personal property and refrain from causing damage;
<P>
<LI>  If directives exist allowing such conduct, the authorities must
immediately revoke them and take measures against those who instituted them;
<P>
<LI> The authorities must thoroughly investigate the events described in this
report and prosecute any soldier or police officer who engaged in wrongoing.
</OL>
<B><I>Postscript:</I></B> The day B'Tselem issued this report, Police searched another
house in Hebron and strip searched four women.  None of the men in the house
were required to undress.

</CENTER>
<P>

<B>B'Tselem</B>'s investigation of Police actions during the events
on the Temple Mount on 27 September 1996 paints a dismal
picture of the widespread, reckless, and illegal use of force,
including lethal force, that left three persons dead and more
than 100 wounded.
<P>
Particularly serious is the use of live ammunition, which to
date has been denied by senior Police officials. <B>B'Tselem</B>'s
investigation unequivocally proves that live ammunition was
used in at least one case.  This is proven by the ballistics
analysis of metal fragments removed from the head of Si'am
Hussein, who was amoung the wounded.  In addition, X-rays
taken of Wa'il Tamimi, who also was wounded during the events
on the Temple Mount, show similar metal particles. For medical
reasons, it was not possible to remove the particles found in
his body, however the X-ray together with the circumstances of
his injury strongly suggest that Tamimi was also wounded by
live ammunition.
<P>
Hussein and Tamimi were injured a meter apart: Hussein in the
back of his head while he was praying, and Tamimi while tying
his shoes so that he could leave the expanse of the Temple
Mount. Their testimonies reinforce each other: from their
positions a meter apart, each describes how the other was
wounded. The two are not acquainted.
<P>
<B>B'Tselem</B> is unable to determine whether the Hussein and Tamimi
cases were the only ones in which police used live ammunition
on the Temple Mount. However, a high degree of likelihood
exists - without drawing any firm conclusion - that two of
those killed, Ayman A-Dakaydak and Ibrahim Ghanam, were killed
by live ammunition.  This conclusion is based on the nature of
their injuries, and where they were located when shot.
<P>
In addition to live ammunition, the police fired rubber
bullets at masses of people, wounding many.  Police open fire
orders do not contain specific instructions for  the use of
rubber bullets.  However, Police regulations are likely to be
at least as restrictive as the IDF's open-fire orders, which
specify that "<B>It is absolutely forbidden</B> to fire rubber
ammunition at a range of less than 40 meters.... Firing a
rubber ammunition projectile rifle will be at a "specific
target," and will be aimed only at the legs of a person who is
identified as a rioter or stone-thrower."
<P>
Contrary to these instructions, the police fired rubber
bullets intensively from a distance of 20 meters and struck
the upper portion of the body. Many of the wounded were shot
while praying, fleeing, or trying to assist the wounded.
<P>
Although less lethal, no less serious is the police use of
clubs. Testimonies given to <B>B'Tselem</B> disprove the Police's
contention that police used clubs only in a few cases when
they were attacked by persons throwing stones at them from
close range. Witnesses told <B>B'Tselem</B> that they had been beaten
with clubs when they tried to leave the mosque or leave the
expanse of the Temple Mount.
<P>
Based on these findings, <B>B'Tselem</B> urges the Department for the
Investigation of Police, of the Ministry of Justice, to
investigate thoroughly the cases of death on the Temple Mount,
and to investigate each and every case in which a suspicion
exists of unjustified use of live ammunition, rubber bullets,
or clubs, or any other means of force.  The Palestinian
contentions that police prohibition on ambulances from
entering the area delayed evacuation of wounded must also be
investigated.
<P>
The ballistics analysis of the bullet fragments taken from the
body of one of the wounded, which was conducted at <B>B'Tselem</B>'s
request, show that the Israel Police Force has the technology
to conduct a ballistic comparison to determine which police
officer fired the bullet that was analysed. <B>B'Tselem</B> urges the
authorities to use this opportunity to conduct a thorough
investigation, and show that Israel is a country governed by
the rule of law, where a serious crime is punished to the full
extent of the law.

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>T</B></FONT>he report presents eleven cases based on testimony
of the victims and eye-witnesses.  Ten cases concern violence by police 
officers and Border Police officers.  One incident concerns a municipal 
inspector.  In all cases, illegitimate and often brutal force was used 
against Palestinians, including children.  Some of the Palestinian victims 
were hospitalized as a result of injuries suffered in these incidents.
<P>
B'Tselem forwarded all the testimonies, together with relevant medical 
documents, to the Department for the Investigation of Police Officers, of 
the Ministry of Justice, and to other official bodies, and requested that 
the cases be investigated. To date, B'Tselem has not been informed of the 
results of any investigation. 
<P>
In almost all of the cases, the Palestinian victims entered Israel without 
permits, were beaten and then returned to the Occupied Territories.  This 
pattern suggests an unwritten policy to deter Palestinians from entering 
Israel without a permit by using violence and degradation. In its conclusion, 
B'Tselem demands that those responsible for security and enforcement of the 
law must totally eradicate this phenomenon.

<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>W</B></FONT>ithin a nine-day period at the end of February and beginning of
March, 1996, Palestinian suicide-bombers killed 58 and wounded
some 200 persons in Israel.  Following the attacks, Israel took
several measures in the Occupied Territories that grossly violate
basic human rights of the Palestinian population. These measures
include severe restrictions on freedom of movement, demolition
of the homes of families of those who perpetrated the attacks and
arrest of family members, closure of educational institutions,
and administrative detentions.
<P>
This report examines the violations of human rights of Palestinians
in the Territories in the one month following the bombings.  Among
the violations detailed in the report:
<UL>
<LI> At least 8 Palestinians died after being refused access to
       medical treatment; dozens of people needing urgent medical
       care in East Jerusalem or in Israel are still waiting to
       receive the necessary permits.
<P>
<LI>      Many Palestinians lost their source of income and suffer from
       economic hardship; the severe restrictions on movement separate
       wife from husband and parents from their children.
<P>
<LI>      Israeli security forces sealed and destroyed 9 houses of
       Palestinian families; another house was accidentally destroyed
       during a demolition.  This has made dozens of people, including
       small children, homeless.
<P>
<LI>      Nine educational and charitable institutions in the West Bank
       and East Jerusalem were shut down.
<P>
<LI>      Nearly 1,000 Palestinians have been arrested thus far by
       Israeli forces; many of these have been placed under
       administrative detention.  A number of petitions to the High
       Court of Justice suggest that many detainees are being
       interrogation with methods which constitute torture.
</UL>
Israel has the right, and even the duty, to take measures to prevent
additional attacks and to protect its citizens, but in doing so,
Israel must adhere to its obligations to human rights standards,
international law, and the various conventions to which Israel
it is a party.
<P>
Israel contends that all these measures are necessary to ensure
the security of its citizens and to prevent further attacks, but
security considerations cannot justify the harsh punitive measures
currently employed, like arrests of relatives of perpetrators of
attacks, demolition of houses, imposition of curfews and closure
on towns and villages, and closure of educational institutions.
These measures clearly constitute collective punishment and breach
the basic tenet of individual responsibility. Other measures, such
as torture and mass arrests, also severely violate basic human
rights and undermine the foundations of the rule of law.
<P>
The measures taken by Israel also reflect a policy of discrimination
against Palestinians based on nationality. When Israelis carried
out violent acts against Palestinians, such as the massacre at
the Cave of the Patriarchs, the government honored the principle
that each individual is responsible for his or her own acts, and
refrained from collective punishment against the perpetrators'
families. 
<P>
The Israeli authorities have not presented a shred of evidence
to substantiate its claim that these measures will deter future
attacks. Indeed, their efficacy as security measures is liable
to be short-lived. Measures like imposing a closure on the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip, imposition of curfews on whole villages,
and demolition of houses of families of Palestinians suspected
of killing Israelis, leaving entire families homeless, are liable
to backfire and increase acts of violence.

- Summary -
</CENTER>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>F</B></FONT>or more than twenty years, the Israeli government has failed to
protect the lives, integrity, and property of the Palestinian
residents of Hebron from repeated attacks by settlers in the city.
<P>

Over the years, serious deficiencies were revealed regarding law
enforcement vis-a-vis settlers, particularly the settlers in Hebron,
in spite of repeated acknowledgments by the Israeli authorities
of their obligations to act forcefully against violence. B'Tselem's
investigation proves that after the Shamgar Commission, and in
spite of its unequivocal recommendations concerning the required
improvements in this area, security forces continue to act half-
heartedly with regard to repeated acts of violence by settlers
in Hebron against Palestinians. In numerous cases, the police
conducted no investigation and only in isolated instances were
those responsible brought to trial. The situation remains unchanged
even though the government decided to adopt the findings of the
Shamgar Commission, and in spite of an increase in police officers
in Hebron, and the opening of another police station in the city.
<P>

The increased presence of security forces in Hebron only exacerbates
the situation and causes violations of Palestinians' human rights.
This presence disrupts their daily lives much more severely than
that faced by residents of any other city in the West Bank.
<P>


In the 18 months since the massacre in the Cave of the Patriarchs: 
 <UL>
<LI>  27 Palestinians were killed in Hebron by security forces,
    and many were injured; 

<LI>  Freedom of movement of Palestinians is significantly restricted
    in Hebron; the city center has 32 roadblocks and 10 manned
    checkpoints, a phenomenon which is found in no other West
    Bank city; entire areas are closed to Palestinians. 50 curfew-
    days have been imposed on Hebron's residents, and they also
    suffered 40 night curfews; 

<LI>   Violent house searches became routine, as did intentional
    harassment and violent acts by soldiers. 
</UL>

The conclusion required by the unique situation of Hebron's Jewish
settlement - located within a large Palestinian city and  creating
constant friction between local Palestinians and settlers - is
unavoidable: the continued presence of Jewish settlers in Hebron
will inevitably result in continued violations of the human rights
of Palestinian residents.  
<P>

In the context of the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian
Authority, an agreement is currently being formulated to arrange
the withdrawal of Israeli security forces from West Bank towns
prior to holding elections in the Territories. Media reports indicate
that this agreement will provide a special arrangement for Hebron
under which the city's Jewish settlement will remain and Israeli
security forces will maintain overall responsibility for the city.
<P>

It is ostensibly possible to preserve Jewish settlement in Hebron
and transfer overall responsibility for Hebron to the Palestinian
Authority, upon its commitment to protect the rights of the settlers. 
However, because of the long history of ongoing confrontations
between the two populations and the positions of the Palestinians
and the settlers, this solution is clearly not realistic.
<P>

B'Tselem urges the government of Israel to dismantle the settlement
in the city of Hebron and remove Israeli security forces from the
city. The absurd reality of Hebron, where a minority of 450 settlers
dictate the lives of 120,000 Palestinians, and the illegality of
the settlement in Hebron under international humanitarian law require
these actions. In doing this, the Israeli authorities must ensure
that any removal of the settlers is accomplished while respecting
their human rights.
<P>

This solution does not constitute a political position; its goal
is to put an end to violations of Palestinians' human rights in
Hebron, many of which result from the existence of Jewish settlement
in the city.  Any political solution which preserves Jewish
settlement in the city and Israeli control over it, wholly or
partially, will lead inevitably to additional violations of the
human rights of the Palestinian residents of Hebron.

<P>
- Summary -
</CENTER>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>T</B></FONT>his report examines the policing activity in the West Bank of
the Preventive Security Service of the Palestinian Authority. 
<P>

Testimonies collected by B'Tselem's fieldworker, on which this
report is based, draw a disturbing picture of human rights violations
of West Bank Palestinians. These abuses include extra-judicial
punishment, abduction of residents from their homes, arrest without
warrants, holding detainees for lengthy periods without any judicial
scrutiny, refusal to allow legal representation, refusal to allow
regular family visits, and use of harsh torture techniques such
as beatings, painful tying-up, threats, humiliation, sleep
deprivation, and withholding of medical treatment. PSS (Preventive
Security Service) agents conduct policing actions without any lawful
authority, and their activities are subject to no judicial review.
The refusal of most of those who gave testimony to B'Tselem, and
many others who have been interviewed by the media on the subjects
raised in this report, to have their names published indicates
that many West Bank residents refrain from publicly criticizing
the PSS out of fear of a harsh and violent reaction by the PSS.
<P>

PSS agents have no legal authority to police the West Bank.  The
"Gaza-Jericho Agreement", signed in Cairo by Israel and the PLO
on 4 May 1994 limits the powers of the Palestinian Authority in
the area of internal security to the territory within its
jurisdiction.
<P>

So long as policing powers on the West Bank have not been transferred
to the PA openly and subject to a system of regulations complying
with international law, Israel continues to be responsible for
the Palestinian population. However, Israel has almost totally
refrained from taking any measures to prevent human rights violations
committed by the PSS and bringing those responsible to justice,
even though in most cases the identity of the perpetrator is known. 
<P>

Israel's shirking of its duty to protect the human rights of
Palestinian residents in the West Bank suggests its disregard for
the residents' well-being and freedom. 
<P>

This neglect of its responsibility is particularly blatant in light
of the determined efforts by the Israeli authorities to prevent
the activities of the PSS in East Jerusalem. Thus, Israel enforces
the law on PSS agents only because their actions challenge Israel's
sovereignty over Jerusalem, and not because they harm the well-being
and security of Palestinian residents. 
<P>

Senior PA officials repeatedly state that the Authority seeks to
respect human rights and preserve the rule of law. In keeping with
these declarations, and to show that they were not merely lip
service, the PA must act immediately to eradicate the practices
described in this report.
<P>

The peace process, the PA's efforts to combat crime among the
Palestinian population, and its desire to establish symbols of
sovereignty in the West Bank cannot justify the trampling on human
rights or excuse acts committed without authority and in flagrant
violation of the law.

<CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=+3><B><I> Incidents of Death and Injury Resulting From
		     Exploding Munitions' Remnants </I></B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>S</B></FONT>ince December 1987, 23 Palestinians have been killed and 60 injured
from the accidental explosion of munitions' remnants in the West
Bank.  A majority of the casualties were children, some as young
as five years old, who stumbled across the munitions either while
herding livestock or playing in or near military training areas.
<P>
In July, B'Tselem released a report which examines the phenomenon
of death and injury of Palestinians in the West Bank resulting
from the explosion of munitions' remnants of the Israel Defense
Forces (IDF).  
<P>
International law, Israeli law and IDF procedures all require Israel
to take measures to protect civilians from munitions' remnants. 
These measures include the provision of information to nearby
residents (through warning signs, maps, etc) regarding the location
of fire zones; construction of fences to prevent accidental entrance
into dangerous areas; and extensive combing of fire zones after
training exercises to remove unexploded munitions.  Israel has
been delinquent in enforcing its obligations.
<P>
In its report, B'Tselem recommended that the IDF ensure ongoing
enforcement of the safety regulations concerning training areas;
provide clear instructions regarding training areas and dangerous
materials to all echelons within the military; and conduct an
extensive investigation into all incidents of injury as a result
of munitions remnants.  In addition Israel should prosecute those
liable for these incidents, initiate payment of compensation and
act to prevent recurrence of similar accidents.

<HR>
<P>
- Summary -
</CENTER>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>S</B></FONT>alem and Hanan 'Ali, residents of Bani Na'im village, Hebron
District, are the parents of a two year old child and an infant
of seven months. Salem Ali, who is 31, was arrested on 29 January
1995 for the first time in his life. He was interrogated for a
period of six weeks.
<P>
A week following his arrest, on 6 February, his wife, Hanan, was
detained.  The GSS interrogated Hanan six consecutive days
continuously for at least eight hours each day. Throughout this
entire period, she was not permitted to shower or change clothes.
The interrogators cursed and threatened her, and photographed her,
all with the intention of getting her to confess about the alleged
acts of her husband.
<P>
At no time during the interrogation did the interrogators contend
that Hanan had violated any law. She was released after one week,
on 13 February 1995; no indictment was filed, and no legal
proceedings were initiated against her.
<P>
In addition to the pressure exerted on Salem through his wife's
detention, Salem was subjected to the typical techniques of torture
and ill-treatment used in GSS interrogations.  These means, cited
in his testimony, included, among others:
<UL>
<LI>    violent shaking of his body, sometimes while knocking his
     body against the wall;
<LI>    blows and kicks to his entire body by GSS interrogators and
     collaborators;
<LI>    sleep deprivation for extended periods of up to two weeks
     and more;
<LI>    being tied each night to a chair (in one instance, to a small
     chair) for weeks at a time;
<LI>    exposure to intense cold, generated by an air-conditioner,
     and to loud music;
<LI>    deprivation of medical supervision and treatment for five
     days although he was ill;
<LI>    being forced to kneel on his toes until exhaustion 
<LI>    being held in poor sanitary conditions.
</UL>
Like his wife, Salem was not indicted or tried for any criminal
offense. When the GSS completed its interrogation, an administrative
detention order for six months was issued against him. He was
released on 29 May 1995, after the period of his detention had
been reduced on appeal.
<P>
Abuse of Palestinians not even suspected of criminal offenses has
been used in the past by security forces in the Occupied Territories
as a means to pressure members of their family. In Hanan's case,
and in an additional case documented by B'Tselem, the authorities
detained and interrogated wives of suspects. In addition to the
serious violations of human rights which took place during the
interrogations, these acts caused severe emotional suffering both
to the suspects and their families. 
<P>
The reports present, with very few deletions, the full testimonies
of Salem 'Ali and his wife, Hanan.

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Land Expropriation, Planning and Building</B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>J</B></FONT>erusalem represents perhaps the most contentious issue in the
negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.  Palestinians
hope to establish their capital in East Jerusalem, while Israel
claims that it will not relinquish control over any part of what
it considers its eternal, indivisible capital.  The process of
resolving these conflicting claims will be central to the
negotiations on the permanent status of the occupied territories. 
In the meantime, in the five year interim period between the
Declaration of Principles and the permanent status arrangement,
both Israel and the PLO agree not to "initiate or take any step
that will change the status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
pending the outcome of the permanent status negotiations" (Article
XXXI of the Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip).
<P>
Despite this agreement, Israel continues to construct Jewish
neighborhoods in East Jerusalem.  In May, B'Tselem released <B>A Policy
of Discrimination: Land Expropriation, Planning and Building in
East Jerusalem</B>.  This comprehensive report details the systematic
and deliberate discrimination against the Palestinian population
of East Jerusalem in all matters relating to land, development
and housing construction.
<P>
Urban development of the city is based on political-national
considerations, rather than addressing the needs of all residents
of Jerusalem.  Since 1967, one central goal has dictated municipal
planning policy: strengthening Israeli control throughout the city. 
This has been accomplished through the construction of Jewish
neighborhoods throughout East Jerusalem and the encouragement of
Jews to settle in them.

<P>
The means to attain this objective include the following:
<UL>
<LI> Land expropriations: Most of the lands expropriated since 1967
were privately-owned by Arabs.  Some 38,500 housing units were
built on this land, all of them for the Jewish population.  Not
one housing unit was built for Palestinians.
<LI> Town Planning Schemes: The planning authorities prepared planning
schemes which, rather than contributing to the development of
Palestinian neighborhoods and easing the housing shortages there,
restrict development and limit the area designated for building
in Palestinian neighborhoods.  At the same time, the Israeli
authorities promote extensive building and enormous investment
for Jewish neighborhoods in East Jerusalem.
</UL>
These policies have increased the housing density in the Arab sector. 
While the average housing density of the Jewish population in 1993
was 1.1 persons per room, for the Palestinian population the density
was 2.2 persons per room.  Furthermore, rather than decreasing
since Israeli occupation, the gap in housing density is twice as
large as that which existed in 1967.
<P>
Although the general contours of Israeli policy in East Jerusalem
were well-known, B'Tselem used official documents from the
Municipality and government offices, minutes from City Council
meetings, court decisions and a review of Town Planning schemes
to document the policy in detail.
<P>
The policies documented by B'Tselem constitute a violation of the
internationally-recognized right to non-discrimination.  Israel
is a signatory to the International Convention on the Elimination
of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which explicitly prohibits
discrimination regarding the right to housing (Article 5 (e) (iii). 
In addition to the principle of non-discrimination, Israel is in
violation of the human right to housing.  Article 11 of the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
recognizes "the right of everyone to an adequate standard of living
for himself and his family, including adequate food, clothing and
housing, and to the continuous improvement of living conditions." 
Furthermore, as a signatory to this Covenant, Israel guarantees
"that the rights enunciated ... will be exercised without
discrimination of any kind" (Article 2(2)).
<P>
Furthermore, under international law, the status of East Jerusalem
is identical to that of the West Bank: it is occupied territory
to which the Fourth Geneva Convention applies.  This Convention
prohibits the occupying power from making permanent changes to
the occupied territory or from settling part of its population
there.  Israel's land use and building policies in East Jerusalem
violate both of these prohibitions.
<P>
B'Tselem had been conducting research for this comprehensive report
for over a year.  However, it expedited its publication upon the
announcement of two decisions regarding land use in East Jerusalem:
a decision to build a Jewish neighborhood upon land which was
confiscated in 1991 (the so-called Har Homa neighborhood) and the
confiscation of an additional 535 dunams of land in East Jerusalem.
<P>
The report was covered widely by both the Israeli and the
international media.  <I>Ha'aretz</I>, the leading intellectual Israeli
daily newspaper devoted a full page to an analysis of the report. 
Yizhar Smilansky, the respected Israeli writer and winner of the
coveted Israel Prize, wrote an article on the report entitled,
<A HREF="prize.htm"> "Israel Prize to B'Tselem" (see accompanying excerpt).</A>
<P>
The report also generated a significant amount of attention among
policy makers both in the government and the municipality.  Jerusalem
Deputy Mayor, Arnon Yekutieli, appealed to the Israeli High Court
regarding land confiscations in Jerusalem.  His appeal was based
largely on B'Tselem's report which was quoted extensively in the
appeal.  The city council held a discussion about discrimination
in planning and housing based on B'Tselem's report.  
<P>
B'Tselem initiated a meeting between the Minister of the Environment,
Yossi Sarid, and planning experts to discuss land use and planning
in Jerusalem.  Sarid is a member of the governmental committee
formed to examine housing issues of Palestinians in East Jerusalem. 
At Sarid's suggestion, B'Tselem provided him with a briefing document
along with concrete suggestions of how to rectify the situation.
<P>
The policies B'Tselem documented in this report continue.  While
the confiscation of the additional 535 dunams has been postponed,
the Municipality continues its plan to construct a Jewish
neighborhood at Har Homa.  Issues of land use in East Jerusalem
are likely to be a contentious issue in the permanent status
negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.  Yet these
negotiations focus on contesting sovereignties over the territory. 
It is crucial that human rights advocates ensure that in this process
the basic rights and needs of the population do not get ignored.

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>O</B></FONT>ver 14,000 administrative detention orders have been issued
to Palestinians since the beginning of the Intifada. Most of
these detainees received a six-month administrative detention
order, some had their detentions extended by an additional six
months, while a few were detained for several years without trial.
<P>
At the writing of the report, Israel's use of administrative
detention had decreased. At the end of September, 1992, there were
185 Palestinians in administrative detention. In the course of
the Intifada  there have been periods when the number of Palestinians
 taken into  administrative detention per month hovered around
the 1,500 mark.
<P>
Eleven Palestinians received, around the writing of the report,
six-month administrative detention orders as a substitute for
deportation orders, which had been cancelled by the new Israeli
government. 
<P>
According to international law, the arrest and detention of persons
without trial is permitted only in situations of unusual and absolute
necessity. International regulations have laid out clear restrictions
and guidelines governing the use of detention without trial, which
emphasize above all that administrative detention is a preventive
measure that can in no way be used as a substitute for punishment. 
<P>
This report describes in detail the criteria in Israeli
and international law for issuing administrative detention orders.
It then describes how the authorities have used this sanction in
the territories since the beginning of the Intifada. The report
seeks to determine  whether administrative detention, as employed
by Israel in the territories, is in fact being used as a
preventive measure. The report then examines the dangers these
detentions purport to prevent. As most of the administrative
detainees (since March 1988) had been held in the Ketziot detention
camp in the Negev desert, the report examines conditions in
Ketziot and seeks to evaluate whether they complied with the
requirements of international law.
<P>
Since the beginning of the Intifada, until the report was issued,
the use of administrative detention had grown to monstrous
proportions, and over 14,000 administrative detention orders had
been issued.
<P>
Both those who unilaterally oppose the use of
administrative detention, and those who consider it permissible
to use this authority in rare and extreme cases, reject the sweeping
use that has been made of administrative detention in the
Israeli-occupied territories. Its use is invalid and illegal for
the following reasons:
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI> Use of administrative detention in the occupied territories
is for purposes of punishment, not prevention.
<LI> Administrative detention procedures and appeals are illegal
<LI> The location of Ketziot, where most of the
administrative detainees were held, was illegal; the conditions
of the facility were illegal and inhuman.
</OL>
The report enumerates grave shortcomings in the areas of
health, nutrition and living conditions, and discusses the
extreme crowding in the tents and the exposure to the difficult
climatic conditions in Ketziot. The report does not, however,
include recommendations for improving these conditions, since our
position was that the entire camp should have been closed down.
Israel,
as part of the international community, is obligated to uphold
the minimum conditions stipulated by the U.N.; lack of prison space,
or lack of funds, are not considerations which justify these
pronounced violations of fundamental rights.

<P>
- Summary -
</CENTER>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>T</B></FONT>his report describes the state of the education system during
the Intifada, focusing on the elementary and high school levels. 
The situation in higher education is noted only as background. 
The report is based on information collected by the Education Unit
from official Israeli sources, Palestinian sources, and via field
trips and interviews.  The field trips included visits to schools
and meetings with Palestinian educators and with Civil Administration
officials responsible for education in the territories.  Also
included are statements by Israeli educators, psychologists and
jurists on various aspects of the setbacks sustained by the education
system in the territories during the Intifada.
<P>
The fourth school year since the start of the Intifada had
opened in September 1990, and already all the Palestinian
pupils had lost precious days.  The Israeli authorities were still
not upholding their international and moral obligation to enable
Palestinian children and youths to enjoy regular studies.  This,
after three years for part of which the education system in the
West Bank was closed more days than it was open, and in which Gaza
Strip pupils also went through long weeks without studies.
<P>
It is difficult to measure the damage that is caused to
children who are prevented from attending school for such lengthy
periods.   It is very doubtful whether these closures generated
respect for the authorities that brought them about.  Closure orders
were issued without stipulating a date for reopening, or were issued
orally by junior officers;  soldiers entered schools without making
any effort to coordinate this with principals or to minimize the
impact on studies.  Such behavior only intensifies the anger of the
population in general and of educators in particular.
<P>
The destruction of the education system becomes more apparent
when viewed against the background of its ongoing neglect since
the start of the occupation.  For more than 20 years, the system
had been maintained in a state of stagnation, deprived of
essential processes of development and change.  We did not ignore
the fact that the education system had undergone tremendous growth
in terms of its scope of activity, human resources, number of
classrooms, and so forth.  However, this growth was a response
to the considerable increase in the number of pupils.  There were
no significant changes in organizational structures, development
of pedagogical conceptions, work modes or teaching methods.  Today,
education systems everywhere are undergoing far-reaching changes,
and in Israel, too, there is increased awareness of the need to
develop the system and adapt it to the modern world.  In light
of this, the ever-widening gap between the school-age populations
in the territories and in Israel could have ruinous consequences. 
The curriculum in the territories consisted of basic subjects only; 
there were no formal or informal enrichment programs that broaden
horizons, scientific and technological studies were at a low level,
there was no acknowledgement of differential teaching methods for
different population groups, and nothing was done to tap the
children's human and social potential to the full.
<P>
Studies in these abominable conditions constituted an abridgement
of the pupils' basic rights.  The right to education to positive
values is nonexistent in a crowded and violent learning atmosphere,
and the children's right to be prepared for life in a modern and
constantly developing world is also infringed.

- Summary -
</CENTER>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>T</B></FONT>his report deals with minors from 
East Jerusalem who were
being held in two police jails in Jerusalem, the Russian Compound,
and the Kishle Police Station in the Old City.  B'Tselem gathered
extensive information on the behavior toward youngsters detained
in the jail in the Russian Compound, and on violence and humiliation
of the children on the part of police and General Security Service
(Shin Bet).  
<P>
This report exposes serious flaws in every aspect of the manner
in which the Israeli Police handled the detention and interrogation
of Palestinian minors suspected of security offenses.  Conditions
in the Russian Compound detention center did not meet even the
most minimal requirements of humane imprisonment.  The problem
of overcrowding in the detention center was particularly bad. 
Minors who had already been tried remained in the detention center
because of overcrowding elsewhere in the prsion services.  This
exacerbated the already strained conditions in the Russian Compound. 
<P>
In spite of this situation, the police often asked the court
to extend periods of detention, including those of minors, although
in many cases the detainees were not interrogated even after the
extentions had been granted.  Herein lay another flaw in the system:
detention of suspects before trial constituted a punishment in
and of itself.
<P>
According to all the evidence at our disposal, it appears
that the use of violence was not restricted to interrogations;
violent treatment had become the norm during the period of detention.
<P>
Although senior police officials rejected the use of violent means
of interrogation, such methods were widely employed.
<P>
The confessions taken from detainees were written in Hebrew,
although the interrogation itself was conducted in Arabic.  The
police department claimed that the interrogators were able to speak
Arabic, but were not proficient in the written language.  Arabic
is an official language in Israel, and there is no justification
for making detainees sign confessions which they are unable to
read.  At the writing of this report, we were informed that the
police were taking pains to find an appropriate solution to this
problem.
<P>
In preparing this report we relied on testimonies
gathered by members of the Organization for Aid to Imprisoned Minors,
and on depositions gathered by our own lawyers.  We also met with
senior officials from the Israeli National Police  to present the
essential complaints garnered from these testimonies and hear the
police's reactions.
<P>
The report includes the response of Superintendent Elinoar
Mazuz, Public Complains Officer in the Police Inspector-General's
Office, to the report.

</CENTER>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B></B>T</FONT>he stated policy of the IDF and other security forces in
the occupied territories was to keep from harming children.  Thus
the regulations for opening fire stress that soldiers may not fire
at children 14 years old or younger, and certainly not kill them.
<P>
Since the beginning of the Intifada and through the end
of December 1989, 136 Palestinian children were killed by
security forces.  40 of them were below the age of 12.  The number
of children were wounded is estimated in the thousands. 
<P>
These figures demonstrate that the IDF had seriously
and continuously failed to implement its policy of not
harming children.  This failure is seen in the IDF's failure to
comply with its own regulations for opening fire. 
<P>
Investigations which B'Tselem conducted into incidents of
death and injury of several children illustrate
this failure.  These incidents differ in their details, but
are essentially similar to numerous other incidents in
which Palestinian children in the territories were killed or injured.
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1> DATA: </FONT></B>
<UL>
<LI><B> As a percentage of total deaths: </B><BR> The 136 children (aged
16 and under) killed in the territories since the beginning of
the Intifada until January 1991 constitute 22.4% of the
total number of deaths by security forces.
<P>
<LI><B> Cause of death: </B><BR>
     Gunfire (including plastic and "rubber" bullets) - 131 children <BR>
     Explosions of dud shells - 4 children <BR>

    <P>
     Toddlers:  7 of those killed were aged 6 and younger.
<P>
<LI><B> Injuries: </B><BR>
A sample:  In 1989 (until the end of the first week
of December), 600 injured children aged 15 or younger were brought
to El-Ittihad Hospital in Nablus.  This constitutes 23% of the
total of those injured during the Intifada who were brought to
this hospital in 1989. 
</UL>
The IDF regulations for opening fire stressed that soldiers
may not begin firing in the vicinity of children.  The regulations
also stated that suspects should be fired at with single shots
only, that only the legs should be aimed at, and that soldiers
may not open fire at a suspect if there is a danger of hurting
others.
<P>
Ammunition shells that the army leaves near dwelling places
had in the past caused incidents of death and injury to both
adults and children. 
<P>
After some members of the Knesset raised the issue, the
IDF ordered an investigation by a senior officer, who advised
that steps be taken to solve the matter.
<P>
The death of Ziad Abu Ramis, 9, as a result of an exploding
object near his village, Za'tara, in the Bethlehem district, on
December 12, 1989, shows that as of the beginning of 1990 until
January 1991 the problem still existed.

- Summary -
</CENTER>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>A</B></FONT>ccording to various sources, at least 771 Palestinians 
suspected of collaboration with Israeli authorities have been
killed between the start of the Intifada and December 1, 1993. Many
others were tortured or subject to ill-treatment during
interrogations.
<P>
      This report condems the killings and torture of collaborators
as gross abuses of the fundamental principles of international
human rights law.  It deals with the responsibility of Palestinian
political organizations and their activists for this phenomenon and
also addresses human rights violations by the Israeli authorities
in recruiting and operating collaborators in the territories.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Background</B></FONT>
<P>
       Since 1967, the Israeli authorities have operated an
extensive network of Palestinian collaborators in the occupied
territories for various purposes. Some are related to security -
such as obtaining intelligence and thwarting violent acts - while
others are political, such as seizing land to establish or expand
settlements.
<P>
      The creation of a broad network of thousands of collaborators
was made possible by the special conditions which exist in the
occupied territories.  Aided by military law, and using "carrot and
stick" policies, the military government has tied the Palestinian
population to a state of total dependence on the Israeli
authorities. Israeli officials commonly condition the granting of
permits or essential services to the collaboration of the
recipients. Other inducements have included granting certain
benefits, erasing criminal or security charges, and reducing
punishments.
<P>
        The collaborators received preferential treatment from the
authorities, and many of them took full advantage of their status.
Collaborators, especially those who were armed by the security
forces, frequently used violence against other Palestinians,
whether as part of their duties or for personal motives. 
<P>          
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Mechanisms of Law and Order</B></FONT>
<P>
     The vacuum created by the collapse of the mechanisms of
law-and-order in the territories, such as police and courts, was
filled during the Intifada by squads or cells identified with the
various Palestinian organizations, both Islamic and PLO-affiliated.
Taking upon themselves the imposition of order in their locales,
among other activities, they set about punishing individuals
suspected of being collaborators. 
<P>
        Many suspected collaborators were killed without any prior
interrogation or quasi-judicial proceeding to clarify the
accusations and without giving them an opportunity to defend
themselves. In other cases, persons were killed during or at the
conclusion of their interrogation - which often included severe
torture. Dozens of Palestinians suspected of being collaborators
were killed in detention facilities.
<P>
        Various sources -- Israeli and Palestinian -- estimate that
more than half of the Palestinians killed as being collaborators
were in fact not used by the authorities in this capacity. One
reason for this disparity is the expansive definition of the term
"collaborator" adopted by the Palestinian organizations. The
designation often included individuals who had close relations with
the military government but were not used as collaborators, as well
as "morals offenders" or others whose behavior was deemed socially
unacceptable. 
<P>
        Over time, the violent interrogations, injuries, and
killings generated growing reservations among the local Palestinian
population, leadership, journalists, and intellectuals from the
secular nationalist streams. This opposition became public
beginning in mid-1991, but protest meetings and public
condemnations were unable to curb the phenomenon.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Responsibility of Palestinian Political Organizations</B></FONT>
<P>
        The responsibility of the PLO and Hamas for killing and
otherwise harming suspected collaborators is clear. Hamas supported
such actions overtly, while the PLO, and Fatah in particular, did
not take the necessary steps which it could have taken in order to
put an end to the killings, despite some public calls expressing
reservations about the phenomenon.  
<P>
        The absence of an organized legal system and adequate law-
enforcement mechanisms in the territories notwithstanding, the PLO
did not impose, nor did it even threaten to impose, sanctions on
the faction activists who continued with the killings despite the
organization's public policy. Such measures, for example, could
have included expulsion of these individuals from the PLO or
breaking off payments to members of the squads who continued these
activities. 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Responsibility of Israeli Authorities</B></FONT>
<P>
      While Israel bears no direct responsibility for the torture
and killing of collaborators, its commissions and omissions in a
number of related areas conflict with its obligations under
international law.
<P>
       The security authorities frequently make use of illegal
methods to recruit collaborators, including: pressure, threats,
extortion, and granting services and permits only if the recipient
agrees to assist the authorities.
<P>
       Israeli authorities are also responsible for operating
collaborators in the interrogation of Palestinians detained by the
Israeli authorities. B'Tselem has documented numerous cases in
which these collaborators used force and torture in extracting
"confessions" on behalf of the Israeli authorities.
<P>
        During the Intifada, at least 23 Palestinians have been
killed by armed collaborators. Moreover, many collaborators have
been involved in criminal acts, such as violence, forgery, and
fraud. In B'Tselem's view, the authorities do not attach the proper
importance to these complaints, and in some instances disregard
criminal acts imputed to collaborators.
<P>
        As part of their duty to ensure the safety and well-being
of all residents of the territories, Israeli authorities have the
responsibility to provide adequate protection to all Palestinians
suspected of being collaborators, whether they actually worked for
the security forces or are at risk for other reasons. The number of
fatalities in this connection during the Intifada points to gross
dereliction in this regard.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Recommendations</B></FONT>
<P>
      The fact that the Palestinians in the territories are subject
to a military occupation and lack law enforcement mechanisms does
not justify extra-judicial killing and torture. The prohibition in
international law against these measures is absolute and
irrevocable, regardless of circumstances.
<P>
        B'Tselem calls on the Palestinian political organizations
to put an immediate stop to the torture and killing of suspected
collaborators, and to sever all financial and organizational ties
with groups that continue to commit such acts.
<P>
       B'Tselem further calls on the Israeli authorities to put an
immediate stop to the recruitment of collaborators by illegal
methods, to stop using collaborators in illegal actions such as
violent interrogations, and to enforce the law equally against
collaborators who use violence or commit other criminal acts.

<P>
- Summary -
</CENTER>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>O</B></FONT>n the morning of February 25, 1994, immediately after receiving
first reports about the massacre in the Tomb of the Patriarchs in
Hebron, B'Tselem called on the Defense Minister to "refrain, to
the greatest extent possible, from the large-scale introduction 
of security forces into areas of Palestinian population
concentrations."  In its appeal, B'Tselem stressed that
"experience from similar situations in the past proves that the
massing of army forces causes unnecessary friction and the taking
of additional victims."
<P>
The IDF chose to enact policies which have failed in the past and
have exacted a high toll in terms of human life. These policies
include: streaming large numbers of troops into heavily populated
Palestinian areas, use of live fire, and the utilization of
various forms of collective punishment on the population. As a
result, in less than a week, 21 Palestinians and one Israeli were
killed.
<P>
The report presents findings of detailed investigations regarding
the circumstances of death of 12 of the Palestinians killed by
the security forces and analysis of the cases. The investigations
reveal the following facts:
<OL TYPE=A START=1>
<LI> In none of the cases investigated by B'Tselem were soldiers or
police in life-threatening circumstances.  In most of the cases,
soldiers engaged in confrontations with the demonstrators, using
live fire, even though they could have readily avoided the
confrontation.
<P>
<LI> None of the fatalities was caused by the use of relatively
"moderate" measures available for crowd dispersal, such as tear
gas, concussion grenades, or plastic bullets.
<P>
<LI> In all of the cases, the victim was hit in the upper portion
of the body (4 in the stomach or chest, 3 in the neck, and 5 in
the head). 
</OL>
The report also describes methods of collective punishment
imposed by the authorities on the Palestinian population, and its
consequences, primarily curfew and closure.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Curfew</B></FONT>
<P>
On February 2, 1994, following the massacre at the Tomb of the
Patriarchs, the IDF placed the city of Hebron under curfew.  The
next day, a curfew was placed on all cities in the West Bank and
on large areas of the Gaza Strip. A population of close to 1.5
million Palestinians was under curfew between 4 to 5 days.  
<P>
As in the past, the curfew was applied only to Palestinian
residents. Jewish settlers continued to move about freely in the
occupied territories. Residents of Kiryat Arba were required to
travel from the community by motorcade only; however, this
limitation was not strictly enforced. 
<P>
The curfew in the Gaza Strip was lifted on March 3, 1994. The
curfew in the West Bank was lifted for only a number of hours to
enable residents to purchase necessary provisions.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Closure </B></FONT>
<P>
The total closure of the territories, lightened slightly prior to
the massacre, was reinstated in full, denying tens of thousands
of Palestinian workers  and their families were access to their
source of livelihood.
<P>
The curfew and closure represent a serious form of collective
punishment enacted against a population in deep distress,
compounded by the fast of Ramadan.

<LI> Introduction;
<LI> Collective punishment in international law;
<LI> Data - the test of reality: curfews and closure, night curfew,
     closure of educational institutions, restrictions on travel abroad,

     well as testimonies and affidavits of residents regarding the practical effect of restrictive collective
measures on their personal lives. 
</OL>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>T</B></FONT>his report addresses the various administrative measures which
were employed by the military government in the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip which raise a question of collective punishment,
a practice forbidden by the norms of public international law.
It addresses those measures that restricted the human rights
of entire population groups - curfew and closure, closure
of educational institutions, disconnection of telephone
lines, restrictions on travel abroad, disconnection of
electricity and water supply, and restrictions on marketing
agricultural produce - as well as measures employed as a
sanction consequent to the commission of a security offense
against persons who are not personally responsible for its
commission - demolition and sealing of houses, and uprooting of
trees.
<P>
The report shows that only rarely were these measures employed with
an express declaration that the purpose was punitive. Usually
the official justification relates to security needs, prevention
or deterrence.  However, the general impression is that the
discretion as to employment of these measures did not properly
balance security considerations with considerations of basic human
rights, and did not attach weight or importance to the governmental
duty to guarantee as far as possible individual liberty, which
falls within the general governmental duty to maintain normal
everyday life under the laws of belligerent occupancy.
<P>
The report also addresses the question of the judicial
review exercised by the High Court of Justice in relation to
the employment of collective punishment measures.  It appears that
in extreme cases, submission of a petition to the court was
sufficient to induce governmental authorities to lift
the restrictions.  But where matters reached the stage of
actual hearing before the court, it repeatedly dismissed the argument
that the restrictive measure was unlawful because it amounted to
collective punishment prohibited under international law.  As regards
house demolition, the court did order the authorities to observe
a due process of law before employing the punitive measure, but
the argument addressing directly the issue of collective punishment
was not explored in depth, which is regrettable.

</OL>
The appendices include the IDF 1945 Seizure and Demolition Order,
the transcript of an affidavit given by the victim of a house
demolition, and testimonies of people whose houses were demolished.
<P>
The primary goal of this report is to present the public with
reliable information on the scope of demolition and sealing
of houses as a punitive measure in the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip during the Intifada.
<P>
We analyzed data and tried to discern the grounds for execution
of this measure, to examine policies, to locate the differences
in the method of execution between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip,
and to appraise the criteria that stand behind the decision to
demolish or seal a house.
<P>
When we tried to establish the exact numbers of houses demolished
and sealed in the occupied territories  as a punitive measure by
the security forces, we encountered various obstacles which prevented
us from reaching definitive and exact figures.
<P>
Our information stems from seven different sources:  two of them
are Palestinian human rights organizations, PHRIC (Palestinian
Human Rights Information Center) and al-Haq (Law in the Service
of Man).  Other sources include field investigations we conducted
ourselves, the Israeli press, the Association for Civil Rights
in Israel, the Israel Defence Forces Spokesperson, and the Ministry
of Defence.
<P>
The defense authorities disregarded the gravity of the issue and
the right of the public to receive accurate and credible information. 
They did not adhere to the principle of the public's right to know
and of the right of freedom of information.
<P>
In the Gaza Strip, the suspicion of a serious offense, such as
murder,  manslaughter, attempted murder, or other life-threatening
acts, was required as the pretext for demolition or sealing.  In
the West Bank, homes of suspected stone throwers, people suspected
of incitement, and people who forcefully resisted arrest, were
also demolished or sealed.
<P>
There were no definite and clear criteria upon which to base the
decision to carry out a demolition or a sealing.  The decision
was apparently quite arbitrary and is left, for the most part,
to the discretion of field commanders.

</CENTER>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>O</B></FONT>n December 17, 1992, Israel deported 415 Palestinians from the
Occupied Territories to South Lebanon for a period of up to two
years. In the five years of the Intifada until then, sixty-six
Palestinians had been deported, in addition to more than 1,000
deported in the first twenty years of Israeli military rule in
the Territories (1967-1987).
<P>
The mass deportation of December 1992 was carried out following
the  killing that month of six members of the Israeli security
forces by Palestinians. Implementation of the deportation began
within hours of the Israeli Cabinet's decision on this measure.
The Cabinet resolution, and the Order Concerning  Temporary
Deportation (Emergency Provision) which was issued in its wake
and which served as the legal base for the deportation orders,
stated that the deportations would be effective upon issuance of
the deportation order, and that the deportees would be denied the
right to a prior hearing, in contravention of the rules outlined
by the High Court of Justice (HCJ) over the years.
<P>
The Israeli Cabinet decided to deport a "large number" of
Palestinians. Following this decision, the security authorities
were allotted very little time to prepare a list of names. The
Military Censor prevented publication of any information regarding
the resolution and its execution.
<P>
After some fourteen hours of deliberation, in the course of which
the deportees remained on the buses, blindfolded, hands tied behind
their backs, the HCJ sanctioned the completion of the deportation.
The deportees were thereupon transferred to Zumriyah Pass at the
northernmost point  of the Israeli "security zone" in Southern
Lebanon. Because of Lebanon's refusal to allow the deportees to
continue northward, and Israel's disavowal of responsibility for
them on the grounds that they were in an area under Lebanese control,
the deportees remained in a zone between Israeli and
Lebanese-controlled territories. They were still in this zone at
the time this report was written. About a month after the
deportation, the HCJ reviewed the legality of the bases in which
the act was grounded and ruled that while the Order Concerning
a Temporary Deportation (Temporary Provision) was null and void, 
notwithstanding, the deportation orders were not invalidated.
<P>
The report begins with an historical review of deportation  as
a punitive measure throughout the world, focusing on Mandatory
Palestine, Israel and the Occupied Territories. This chapter is
followed by an analysis of the violation of basic human rights
entailed in deportation, and an explication of the position taken
by international law and by Israeli law on this subject.
<P>
Section two of the report deals with the mass deportation of December
1992, addressing its practical and legal aspects and the grave
human rights issues involved. Also included an article by Israeli
legal expert  Moshe Negbi on the legal ramifications of the
deportation and the HCJ ruling in particular.
<P>
The report also contains testimonies and figures based on an
investigation conducted by B'Tselem's fieldworker  Bassem 'Eid
in the deportees' camp in southern Lebanon on January 31, 1993,
and on data from the al-Haq Human Rights organization.
<P>
Appendices include the text of the cabinet resolution on the mass
deportation, the text of the military orders, and lengthy excerpts
from documents submitted to the High Court. A full list of the
deportees, with details about each individual, is also appended.

<FONT SIZE="+2"><B> Renewal of Deportation of Women and Children from the Occupied
Terrirories on Account of "Illegal Residency" </B></FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><B> September-October 1991 </B></FONT>

<HR>
<P>
- Summary -
</CENTER>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>I</B></FONT>n the recent weeks before the writing of this report, B'Tselem
gathered information about the deportation from the occupied
territories of Palestinian women and children who did not possess 
visitors' permits.  An examination of this information revealed
a clear pattern: the security authorities had resumed the systematic
deportation of people - mostly women and children - who had stayed
in the territories without  visitors' permits, thus separating
them from other members of their families.
<P>
The majority of cases concern Palestinian women who are not
residents of the territories (and their children), but who are
married to residents of the territories.  Many of these women had
their requests for family reunion rejected, leaving them with no
choice but to enter the territories with the status of "visitor,"
on a permit valid for a limited period.  When the permit expires,
their presence becomes "illegal."
<P>
Approximately two years prior to the writing of this report,
the authorities began deporting women with this status.  The policy
caused a public outcry both in Israel and abroad, and was eventually
stopped for what was termed "humanitarian reasons."  Some time
later, the State Attorney's Office, responding to a petition filed
with the High Court of Justice on this subject, announced an
arrangement that would enable the women and children who had been
deported to return to their homes, as well as a policy of
not deporting them again.
<P>
B'Tselem was in possession of information regarding several
dozen women who in the recent weeks prior to the writing of this
report were directed to leave the territories with their children. 
At least three had left.
<P>
Following intervention by B'Tselem and the Association for
Civil Rights in Israel, the permits of most of the women were
extended, and the Judea and Samaria Legal Advisor announced that
an order had been given in all the districts to freeze the
deportations.  However, additional deportation notices had been
issued in the meantime.  According to letters from the State
Attorney's Office and the Office of the Judea and Samaria Legal
Advisor, the state claimed that the arrangement announced at the
High Court hearing applied only to those women who married and
entered the territories before June 1990, the date of the
announcement. In other words, the administration felt at liberty
to deport those who married and entered the area subsequent to
this arbitrary date.
<P>
The security authorities were acting to prevent the residency
of two main groups: 
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI>  wives of residents who had transferred the main focus of
their lives to another place, namely, those who had resided outside
of the territories for many years 
<LI>  women who married subsequent to the High Court of Justice hearing
</OL>
One year following the High Court of Justice hearing, it
appeared that the new policy did not succeed in practice, and the
status of the families remained as unclear as before:  a large
number of women and children in the territories were denied legal
status - they did not have identity cards, their children were
not registered on their parents' identity cards, and they possessed
no rights or guarantees.  
<P>
Thousands of families in the territories, and not only women
who had been deported and permitted to return, lived in this
situation of uncertainty and "illegality."  There thus existed
an almost unknown additional "grey area" in the military rule in
the territories, which was fertile ground, both in theory and in
practice, for severe violations of one of the fundamental rights
of humanity:  to found a family and live together.

<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>T</B></FONT>his report presents an initial investigation undertaken by staff of
B'Tselem and Palestinian Lawyers for Human Rights in Jabalia Refugee Camp
on March 29, 1994. The report covers an incident in which 6 Palestinians
were killed by members of an undercover unit on March 28, 1994. The
investigation presents grave findings regarding the conduct of the soldiers
in this incident. 
<P>
Testimonies from 5 eyewitnesses to the events are reproduced.
<P>
<B>The testimonies taken by B'Tselem and by Palestinian Lawyers for Human
Rights reveal the following facts:</B>
<OL>
<LI> The undercover unit engaged in an initiated operation. The undercover
forces aimed at the masked men and opened fire with no warning or shots
fired into the air. Some of the masked men were armed; but the undercover
forces did not fire in self-defense; they shot with the intention of
killing. 
<P>
<LI> After the first shots were fired, a masked man who was lightly injured
tried to escape and was caught. After he was in the custody of the
undercover forces, a pistol was aimed at his head by one of the undercover
soldiers and he was shot to death at close range.
<P>
<LI> The undercover forces shot repeatedly, at short range, at the five
remaining Palestinians, apparently to ensure that they were dead.
<P>
<LI> The bodies were left in place, apparently with no treatment or even
medical examination. Attempts by a Palestinian  ambulance to enter the area
were prevented.
<P>
<LI> The bodies were buried in the middle of the night. Female family
members, including mothers, were not permitted to accompany their dead to
the burial.
</OL>
B'Tselem and Palestinian Lawyers for Human Rights view the conduct of the
soldiers in this incident with utmost gravity. Their conduct is grossly
illegal by any standard of justice. 
<P>
We demand the establishment of an independent investigation into this
incident in particular, and the open-fire policies of the undercover forces
and the IDF in the occupied territories, in general.
<P>
We call on the investigation to examine whether the procedure called
"Procedure for Ensuring Death," as was carried out in this incident, does
in fact exist in the IDF. If such a procedure exists, we call for its
unequivocal eradication.
<P>
B'Tselem and Palestinian Lawyers for Human Rights demand that legal
proceedings be brought against whoever is responsible for this shameful
incident. 
<P>
The report also includes testimony of a reserve soldier on the "Procedure
for Ensuring Death" in which suspects caught while fleeing are then shot at
close range in the head.
<P>
As with all B'Tselem reports, the response of the IDF Spokesperson is
appended to the report.

</CENTER>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>I</B></FONT>n Khan Yunis, a city in the southern Gaza Strip of almost one
hundred thousand residents, December 1992 was one of the most
turbulent months experienced by any community in the territories
since the beginning of the Intifada.
<P>
Human rights violations in Khan Yunis during that month included
the following:
<UL>
<LI><B> Casualties: </B> 11 residents, including 4 children, were killed
by live fire of the security forces; over one hundred were injured.
<LI><B> Deportations: </B>23 Khan Yunis residents were deported to southern
Lebanon.
<LI><B> Curfew: </B> The city was under curfew for 17 days, 10 of them
consecutive, and was sealed off for 2 additional days.
<LI><B> House Demolition and Damage: </B> Missile fire destroyed one house,
and left another severely damaged.
<LI><B> Arrests and detentions: </B> Some 130 Khan Yunis residents were
arrested. Many received orders for detention without trial
(administrative detention).
<LI><B> Violence: </B>Some of the arrests were violent. In other instances,
soldiers burst into private homes and caused considerable damage
to property.
<LI><B> Interruption of Studies and Use of Force in Schools: </B> As a
result of the curfew, pupils in Khan Yunis missed 17 school days.
In 2 instances, soldiers forcefully entered schools. In one of
these incidents, a pupil was killed by gunfire.
<LI><B> Prevention or Delay of Medical Treatment: </B> In at least two
instances security forces prevented the administering of medical
treatment or removal of injured persons. In another case a vehicle,
which was evacuating a critically injured person, was delayed,
during which time the patient died.
</UL>
While violations in Khan Yunis were extensive, they were neither
unique to this city nor to the month of December 1992. Rather,
they reflected the policy  of successive Israeli governments in
the occupied territories from December 1987 - December 1992. This
report presents a portion of the data and testimonies gathered
by B'Tselem workers in Khan Yunis regarding the month's events
in the city, along with descriptions by soldiers and official
sources.
<P>
The report contains eyewitness testimonies given to B'Tselem
pertaining to some of the killings.  It also includes an excerpt
from a December 25, 1992 "Ha'aretz" interview with some of the
soldiers involved in the incidents in Khan Yunis:
<P>
"We are having a hard time emotionally. We are carrying
the killings around with us, and they will stay with us for all our
lives. It is not easy to confront and kill people - it will always
be with us. We are currently trying to obtain the films shot by
foreign journalists and networks in order to better understand
what happened there.
<P>
...In the midst of a large riot, which brought about the death
of Palestinians, we discovered a young man who was armed, surrounded
by 20 small children, and we couldn't shoot him.  He was at a range
of some 30 m. from our soldiers, but the children, who were age
8 to 15, protected him like a live wall."
<P>
The report contains testimonies pertaining to violent arrest
and deportation, house demolition and damages by missile fire,
destructive searches accompanied by shooting, and interference
with the evacuation of a critically wounded person on December
19, 1992.

<HR>
<P>
- Summary -
</CENTER>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>M</B></FONT>ustafa Barakat, a young Palestinian 23 years of age, was arrested
in full health, and died from an asthma attack less than 36 hours
later, in the interrogations wing on the Tulkarm prison.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>The following conclusions emerge from this report, and from
other information gathered by B'Tselem: </B></FONT>
<OL>
<LI> The interrogations wing in which Barakat was held is
controlled and supervised exclusively by the GSS. The prison
commander, legally responsible for the facility, cannot stipulate
what GSS personnel who operate on the grounds of the prison facility
did or did not do. The interrogation rooms in the wing are closed
to the commander of the prison and his staff, including the physician
in charge.
<P>
<LI> In the interrogations wing where Barakat was held,
violent measures, some of which constitute torture, are still
employed. It is reasonable to assume that some of these measures
were used against Barakat at least on his first day there.     
<P>
<LI> In accordance with prison procedure, Barakat was formally inducted
into the prison after being examined by a medic, and
his interrogation began at that point. During the first
interrogation, Barakat had an asthma attack. Only the next day
was he given a routine examination by a physician, in which he
was certified as fit for detention.
<P>
<LI> Certification of a detainees's fitness for imprisonment included
certification for interrogation. In light of the formal sanction
given to interrogators to use violence, the medical staff in effect
certified Barakat's fitness for violent interrogation.
<P>
<LI> As stated, a physician is forbidden from entering
GSS interrogation rooms. Thus, it was impossible for the physician
in charge to properly monitor Barakat's health.
<P>
<LI> It should be noted that the fatal attack occurred very
shortly after the conclusion of the last interrogation session
(45 minutes at the most).  Barakat had not suffered from asthma
for many years. 
</OL>
The case of Mustafa Barakat is conspicuous because it ended
in death. Yet its circumstances are in no way unusual.
Everything that happened to Barakat, from his imprisonment until
his death, was in the framework of routine procedure. Mustafa Barakat
had a special susceptibility and he did not survive.
<P>     
Routine procedure includes imprisonment without contact with
the outside world for two weeks, the absolute prohibition on
persons from outside the system from visiting interrogation wings,
the extensive freedom of activity afforded the interrogators,
the formal sanction for use of violence in interrogation, and the
lack of clarity regarding realms of authority and jurisdiction
between the prison authorities, the GSS and the physicians. The
role of the medical staff also raises difficult questions of medical
ethics. These conditions, combined, create a situation in which
the security and health of those interrogated is by no means
ensured, in absolute contradiction to the requirements of
international and Israeli law.
<P>     
Since the beginning of the Intifada, until September 1992, there
had been four cases in which Palestinians had died during or soon
after interrogation.
<P>     
This report endeavors to give a step-by-step account of
what happened to Mustafa Barakat during the 36 hours which
passed between his arrest and his decease, and addresses the
difficult issues raised by the circumstances of his death.

</OL>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>S</B></FONT>ince October 1988, numerous reports have been published about
the existence of undercover units that operate in the territories
for all intents and purposes as liquidation squads.  The reports
were repeatedly denied by security soruces until the units were
exposed in an Israeli television report by Mordechai Kirshenbaum. 
That report defined the units' mission: "to apprehend wanted
Palestinians from the hard core of the Intifada, those with blood
on their hands."
<P>
In the recent months prior to May 1992, the IDF was employing a
new policy against these wanted persons, described by the OC Central
Command, Maj.-Gen. Dani Yatom, in media interviews, as an "offensive
policy." The practical result of this policy has been, first and
foremost, the capture of hundreds of wanted Palestinians, and the
killing of at least ten, in the first four months of 1992, most
of them by the undercover untis.
<P>
According to B'Tselem's data, some seventy residents of the
territories were killed by the undercover units betwen the start
of the Intifada and the end of April 1992.  An analysis of the
cases shows that many of those killed were hit by more than one
bullet, and usually in the upper part of the body.  It is our
assessment that in a large percentage of the cases, it was possible
to apprehend the suspects without killing them.
<P>
Various military sources have denied the existence of a policy
of "liquidating wanted persons," but the testimonies collected
by B'tselem indicate that even if there is no official policy that
permits such killing, in practice the phenomenon exists.
<P>
The following conclusions emerge from the report:
<UL>
<LI>The soldiers in the special units are equipped with live ammunition
only.  In many cases, no serious attempt is made to stop the persons
killed, or to employ less severe measures (plastic and rubber
bullets, tear gas, etc.) before the shooting which causes their
death.
<LI>Many of those killed were shot from close range, an dhit in their
upper body.  In many of the cases, the person killed was hit by
a large number of bullets.
<LI>In four of the ten cases presented in the report, it was claimed
that the soldiers aimed their weapons at the feet of the suspect,
but hit him in the body (Tamun - August 1988, Ramallah - July 1989,
Tulkarm - March 1992, and Sa'ir - May 1992). (In the case of Sa'ir,
the suspect was shot in the head.)
<LI>B'Tselem knows of 5 cases of persons killed apparently by msitake.
<LI>The percentage of persons killed who were armed when they clashed
with the undercover units has risen in recent months, and from
January to April 1992, reached 50%.  Still, fifty-percent of those
killed are unarmed.   
</UL>
Various military sources denied the existence of a policy
of "liquidating wanted persons," but the testimonies collected
by B'Tselem indicate that even if there was no official policy
that permitted such killing, in practice the phenomenon existed.
This report illustrates how the methods of operation employed by
the special units, on the one hand, and the message transmitted
to the soldiers by the entire military system, on the other, caused
so very many deviations from the declared policy.
<P>
The first part of the report describes briefly the methods
of operation of the special units,  and the instructions for opening
fire in the IDF in general and in the undercover units in particular.
A comprehensive legal analysis of the subject is also presented.
<P>
The legal section of the report reviews the relevant court decisions,
and elucidates the restrictions stipulated by the Supreme Court
regarding use of the "self-defense" claim, and the criteria for
apprehending a suspect and shooting during the procedure for
apprehending a suspect.  In addition, the section reviews the
prohibitions in international law against killing without a trial,
and against the inordinate use of force by those vested with
enforcing the law.
<P>
"Self-defense" applies only in a situation in which a person is
defending himself from attack, and on condition that the action
was intended to ward off an attack, and was reasonable in order
to prevent harm.  "Self-defense" does not justify an action directed
at a future danger, but rather, only an action necessary to ward
of an attack actually occurring. Force may not be used prior to
attack, or after the danger has passed.
<P>
Even if there is no policy of "eliminating" wanted eprsons, the
report indicates an atmosphere which justifies fatal shooting by
undercover units in general, and shooting at wanted persons in
particular, including circumstances which do not justify "self-
defense," as defined in the ruling.  In the zeal to capture wanted
persons, deviations from the official orders are understood as
an unavoidable necessity.
<P>
The message passed on to soldiers in the "oral tradition" which
has grown up around the written orders, is that even if the killing
of wanted persons is not a goal in and of itself, it is not viewed
as wrong.
<P>
This message is as immoral as it is illegal.   In the State of
Israel, as in all properly functioning countries, only a court
is authorized to impose a death sentence on a person, after he
has been lawfully tried and convicted.  The charges against wanted
persons, no matter how grave, do not justify aberrations from this
principle.  The legal and defnese establishments bear the
responsibility of elucidating this to those who operate in the
territories on their behalf, and of preventing all unjustified
killing.

<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>T</B></FONT>his summary describes the circumstances of the death of Mahmud
'Alayan:
<P>
On April 5, 1991, Mahmud Muhammad Salim 'Alayan, a 14-year-old
resident of the Far'ah Refugee Camp in the Nablus District, was
shot to death following an incident in which stones were thrown
at an IDF patrol.  The IDF Spokesperson informed B'Tselem in a
telephone conversation that the youth had been shot by a soldier
in the patrol which had been attacked.  
<P>
According to testimonies brought to the attention of B'Tselem,
from residents of the  Camp and of UNRWA personnel who were witness
to the incident there was reason to suspect that the youth had
been shot by a sniper positioned on a rooftop-outlook outside the
camp.  Furthermore, according to these same witnesses, the shooting
occurred after the military jeep which had been attacked with the
stones had either left the area of the camp or was on its way out,
close to the gate of the camp, and after the members of the patrol
were out of the range of the stones.
<P>
In December 1990, the IDF announced that it had begun to
operate undercover units of soldier-snipers in the territories,
in order to shoot at stonethrowers.  These units were granted
permission to shoot to hit if the stone about to be thrown posed
a threat to human life.  The then Chief of Staff, Dan Shomron,
explained to the Knesset Security and Foreign Affairs Committee
that the snipers who could shoot at stonethrowers were placed
subsequent to extensive deliberations, and that the order had been
carefully written in great detail and had been approved by the
Office of the Military Advocate (See, for example, Ha'aretz,
December 12, 1990).  Approximately one week later, the Office of
the Defence Minister instructed the IDF to refrain from using the
term, "sniper shooting," and to call this "initiated activity"
instead.  
<P>
From the testimonies, it appears that:
<OL>
<LI> The youth had not participated in any way in the stonethrowing,
but had emerged from the mosque after the jeep had left the site.
<LI>  The soldiers in the jeep at which the stones were thrown did
not respond at the time of the incident.
<LI>  The shot was fired after the jeep was no longer at the site,
and in any case, no threat to the soldiers was posed.
</OL>

<OL>
<LI> Introduction;
<LI> The legal aspect;
<LI> Rules of engagement;
<LI> Plastic bullets: use and consequences;
<LI> Policy changes in the rules of engagement during the Intifada;

</OL>
This report sets out to examine the substance and the character
of the Rules of Engagement (regulations for opening fire) that
were in force in the territories; the changes that have been
implemented in the policy regarding the opening of fire during
the Intifada; and the essence, nature and legality of the application
of the rules in the field.  The report does not present an opinion
as to the legality of the regulations.  
<P>
The report is based on considerable information that was
compiled from, among other sources: B'Tselem's data; the media;
judgments handed down by the High Court of Justice and by military
courts; the IDF Spokesperson;  publications of the Israeli Foreign
Ministry; reports issued by international human rights organizations
such as Amnesty International, The Lawyers Committee for Human
Rights, Human Rights Watch; and the human rights survey published
by the U.S. State Department.
<P>
The report endeavors to trace the Rules of Engagement and
their application starting with the written text, and proceeding
to the unwritten rules, the attitudes of troops and the security
authorities, implementation in the field, the report of the unit
involved, and, finally, the investigations and their results.
Overall, the impression that emerges is that there is an atmosphere
of an "itchy trigger finger", a lax observance of regulations,
the absence of exhaustive investigations and a failure to mete
out deterring and educational punishment, to the point where
legitimacy is conferred on unjustified firing and violation of
the law. The report also presents the  rules of the Israeli
National Police for opening fire as an alternative to the IDF's
Rules of Engagement in the territories.

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>T</B></FONT>his Information Sheet deals with two phenomena 
relating to the
daily contact between IDF troops and Palestinian residents of the
territories.  One is damage to property and entry into private
property, and the other is the beating and degradation of men
and women during searches and arrests.
<P>
The IDF often took over buildings, roofs, or entire floors
in private homes in the territories, most often to set up
observation posts inside Palestinian settlements, as both a deterrent
and a security measure against disturbances and stone throwing,
but also to house soldiers.  The seizure was effected by a military
order signed by the Regional Commander, on the basis of the
general authority vested in him under international law as commander
of IDF forces in the region.
<P>
A High Court of Justice (HCJ) ruling determined that
if a military need arises for the temporary seizure of private
property in return for monetary compensation, the military
authorities may exercise their authority.  The HCJ ruled that such
measures are not precluded by Regulations 23(6) and 52 of the
Hague Regulations.
<P>
B'Tselem conducted a comprehensive investigation, examining many
houses in the West Bank and Gaza Strip that were seized for military
purposes.  In only one of these cases was the owner given a seizure
order for his house.  In all the other cases the owners say they
neither received an order nor were told how long the soldiers would
remain in their houses.  In principle the occupants were entitled
to compensation for damages, and families evacuated from their
homes were entitled to payment for the use of the domicile, but
in many cases the residents were unaware of these rights.
<P>
Beyond these legal questions, however, the cardinal problem here
concerns the soldiers' behavior.  Numerous testimonies dwell on
manifestations of filth, noise, and lack of consideration for the
occupants of the houses seized.  Others speak of damage caused
to property; of soldiers throwing garbage and relieving themselves
in places not intended for those purposes; and of soldiers showering
or sunbathing fully or partially naked, actions that are
disrespectful of the residents' sensitivities and show disregard
for their way of life.
<P>
The incident described in the report (Purimshpiel in 'Abud)
occurred on the holiday of Purim. An IDF unit entered a West Bank
village on a search-and-arrest operation after stones were thrown
at passing Israeli vehicles.  During the operation several villagers
were beaten and humiliated, and property was damaged.  B'Tselem's
investigation was undertaken following the receipt of a letter
from one of the soldiers in that unit, who was shocked by the events.
<P>
The description that follows in the report is based on both the
testimony of the soldier and testimonies supplied by villagers
which reinforced and confirmed the former's evidence.

- Summary -
</CENTER>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>P</B></FONT>olitical rights of Palestinians in the territories in general,
and the right to demonstrate in particular, were severely limited
in comparison to the accepted norms in Israel, and among the Jewish
settlers in the territories.  Since the end of the 1970s, open
political activity of Palestinians in the territories had been
forbidden, with the exception of the activities of the Village
League, which was permitted to conduct public political gatherings
and events with the backing of the military government.  Political
gatherings in the territories were totally forbidden to Palestinians,
while they were generally permitted for Jewish residents of the
territories and Israelis who did not live in the territories, but
who were identified with the settlers' position.  Other Israelis
seeking to demonstrate and protest against government policy and
the settlements faced limitations which required them, in many
cases, to turn to the High Court of Justice, and only as a result
of the Court's intervention were they able to hold non-violent
protests.
<P>
Only occasionally, and inconsistently, did the IDF allow
Palestinians from the territories to conduct assemblies and even
more rarely, processions, but these cases did not reflect a set
policy.  For certain periods, the IDF did not prevent conferences
of mayors, trade unions, and academics in the territories, while
in other periods, it prevented similar conferences by orders which
closed an entire area, or even closed universities or other
institutions.  Palestinians, until November 1991, were prevented
entirely from requesting permits to hold assemblies and processions.
<P>
According to international law, the military government may
indeed deny freedom of expression in an occupied area, including
banning demonstrations, but according to the Israeli Supreme Court,
it also has an obligation to ensure order and public life, and
to assure "the existence of a government which protects civil rights
and sees to the general welfare of the population."
<P>
In addition, the Supreme Court recognized that freedom
of expression is a defensible principle also in occupied
territory, ruling that the authority seeking to limit this right
must demonstrate that extraordinary reasons exist which justify
a deviation from this principle.  The Supreme Court also accepted
the principle that there must be an appropriate balance between
two important public interests:  freedom of expression on the one
hand, and proper execution of the government's tasks on the other.
<P>
Israel's control in the territories for almost 25 years, and
the large-scale building for the Israeli civilian
population, illustrate that Israel was acting from the viewpoint
of a long-term occupation.  Based on this approach, which takes
expression in other spheres as well, the authorities must maintain
a better balance between the security needs and freedom of
expression, and demonstrate greater openness in approving non-violent
demonstrations in the territories.  It appeared to us that the
authorities tended to shy away from this responsibility to keep
a balance, with their tendency to limit demonstrations
systematically, particularly in the Palestinian sector, but also
in the case of Israelis who wished to demonstrate against
government policy and the settlements.  Thus, the military government
did not rest at implementing Order 101 Prohibiting Activities
of Incitement and Hostile Propaganda, requiring a license for
holding "gatherings" and "processions."  Rather, it also prevented
activities that did not require permission, such as "protest vigils,"
"ceremonies," and "outings," by declaring a closed military area.

<HR>
<P>
- Summary -
</CENTER>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>T</B></FONT>he vast majority of the daily and periodical press available
in the territories was published in East Jerusalem.  There the
press operated under Israeli law and was subject to fewer
restrictions than the handful of periodicals published in the
territories themselves.  We thought it appropriate to concentrate
on the East Jerusalem press both because of its intrinsic importance
and because it operates under the same laws that apply in Israel.
<P>
The first part of this Information Sheet surveys censorship of
the East Jerusalem press in the context of censorship restrictions
relating to the Israeli press in general.
<P>
The second part consists of an analysis of material approved and
censored in two East Jerusalem papers over given periods. 
<P>
The third part consists of examples collected by B'Tselem
ƒ reports, articles, photos, and cartoons ƒ that were banned
for publication in the East Jerusalem press, and of
correspondence between the censor and the editors of the papers
in question.
<P>
Few people, if any, would dispute the fact that Israel's
security requirements necessitate military censorship.
<P>
Security requirements may indeed constitute a justifiable reason
for taking legitimate measures intended to protect public safety. 
However, when used unwisely, "security requirements" can easily
be turned into a sweeping justification for arbitrary measures
and for unjustifiable infringement upon public and individual
freedoms. 
<P>
It is incumbent upon the censor to realize the gravity of
the responsibility inherent in his role when limiting freedom
of expression, a freedom which Justice Agranat characterized as
a "preeminent right" over which security interests have
priority "only when truly required by the situation."  This
applies even when the censor operates  under the protection of
a law ƒ the legacy of a foreign occupier ƒ which grants him
extraordinarily broad powers.
<P>
B'Tselem's investigation indicates that at least in the case of
the Palestinian press in East Jerusalem, the censor was a long
way from adopting Justice Agranat's narrow approach.  The
investigation reveals that the censor practiced massive censorship
of journalistic material of almost every variety, source, and
subject.  In dozens of cases we examined, the censor banned reports
that had been translated verbatim from the Hebrew press; items
that were purely political in content, including statements by
government ministers and other Israeli public figures; items  on
reports of human rights organizations; and items that had been
approved for publication in other East Jerusalem papers. Photographs
and political cartoons fared no better. 
<P>
The IDF Spokesperson and the censor explained some of these phenomena
as mistakes.  However, the frequency with which such "mistakes"
occurred indicates either the existence of a deliberate policy,
or alternatively, a degree of negligence  which was entirely
inappropriate in the treatment of so sensitive a subject.
<P>
It is important to reiterate that according to Israeli law, the
Palestinian press in East Jerusalem is in every respect part of
the Israeli press.  It is therefore hard to avoid the conclusion
that another basic principle of democracy had been violated here: 
the principle of equality before the law.

clarification of the army's position regarding the banning of the
publication of books in the territories (letter sent August 28,

the criteria were for banning books in the occupied territories
in general and in prisons in particular.  Similarly, we asked if
there was any possibility to appeal the banning of a book and
if there was any precedent for a book which was banned being

B'Tselem -- Zehava Gal'on

     Re:  The Banning of Books in the Occupied Territories

1. Procedures for banning the distribution and reading of books
   in the occupied territories:
   The authority that decides on prohibitions is the censor for 
   journalism and communications (the military censor).  The censor's
   authority derives from the Defence (Emergency) Regulations, 1945, 
   as well as orders from the civil administration, among them an order
   giving the censor a mandate over areas under civil administration.

     Books are banned if their contents, in the opinion of the 
   censor, are liable to damage state security, public safety, or
   public order, either within the State of Israel and/or in the areas
   under civil administration.  The titles of banned books are removed
   from merchants' import lists (about 20,000 Arabic language books
   are imported annually).  From time to time orders listing banned
   books are released.

2. Banning books in prison facilities:
   Does not fall under the authority of the military censor. 
   The banning of books in prison facilities is one of the 
   responsibilities of the postal and telegraphic censor in the 
   Ministry of Defence. (Please apply to the Ministry of Defence for details).
 
     Everything brought into prison facilities by various bodies,
   including books, is done so via the Red Cross.  The Red Cross
   coordinates its activities with the Ministry of Defence, which
   is responsible for passing the books on to the postal and telegraphic
   censor.  (In recent months, hundreds of approved books were brought
   into prison facilities.  During this period, only 2-3 books were
   banned in the prison facilities.)
 
3. Appeals:
   The banning of a book can be appealed to the commander of a 
   censorship base or to the Chief Censor (for distribution in the
   territories).

4. Reasons for banning the books listed in your inquiry:
   These books were banned because their contents were damaging
   to state security, public safety, and public order;  they also
   included calls for uprisings, unrest support for terrorists, and
   encouragement of violence.  It should be noted that some of these
   books were banned for additions made by the translator, which include
   slanderous and inflammatory comments, and not for the content of
   the book itself.


                         Wishing you a good year,
                         Lieutenant Liat Menachmi
                         Information Officer

<HR>
<P>
- Summary -
</CENTER>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>A</B></FONT>ccording to estimates by Palestinian 
engineers, there were
approximately 13,000 homes in the West Bank which had been built
without permission at the writing of this report.  Approximately
80,000 people lived with the apprehension that a demolition order,
or bulldozers, would arrive at  their doorstep, and that they would
find themselves without a roof over their heads.  This fear was
based on the fact that each year, hundreds of homes were indeed
demolished.  Notwithstanding this risk, many Palestinians continued
to build homes without permission.
<P>
This report focuses on rural areas in the West Bank where
the problem was especially grave.  Within city limits in the West
Bank,  there were local municipal planning authorities, whereas
in the Gaza strip, demolitions were rare.
<P>
In most countries, building planning and authorizations are
an administrative matter and of no interest to human rights
organizations.  B'Tselem had nevertheless chosen to examine this
issue in the West Bank  for three reasons:
<UL>
<LI>  Data showed that the number of building licenses issued in the
West Bank was extremely small, and fell far below the minimum housing
needs.  At the same time, the authorities continued to demolish
premises built without permission.  Thus, rural West Bank
Palestinians had no proper way of exercising their natural
right to build a home.  The situation worsened considerably since
the beginning of the Intifada.
<LI>  Investigations, testimonies and discussions conducted by B'Tselem,
painted a picture of  secrecy, arbitrariness, disorganization and
endless delays in dealing with requests for licenses.  In an
interview with B'Tselem on June 10, 1990, Coordinator of Activities
in the West Bank Shumel Goren defined this situation in the  West
Bank as "improper."   Israel was obliged by international conventions
to maintain proper administration in the territories.
<LI>  The planning and building system in the Israeli settlements
in the West Bank was efficient, sympathetic and lenient
regarding unlicensed construction, creating a clear case of
discrimination.
</UL>
The West Bank village resident who requested a license to build 
on his land faced an extremely difficult, and in many  
cases impossible task:
<UL>
<LI> to prove ownership, although the land registration system is
obsolete and defective.                                     
<LI> to  present  proof  of having no debts or  problems with the
authorities,  a requirement which is entirely irrelevant and 
does not exist in Israel.                                    
<LI> to appear before an information board which will not approve
any  plan  which:
<OL Type=a>
<LI> is not within village  boundaries (the boundaries are not shown to
 applicants, and usually not even to their lawyers); 
<LI> which is  near an existing or proposed 
highway  (plans of  which  are not  given  to   applicants), 
<LI> which is located on government or army lands.             
</OL>
<LI> When permission is refused, the applicant may invest a large
sum  of  money and submit a parcellation plan for the  plot. 
The planning bodies tended not to approve such plans.        
<LI> Another option is to build without a license.

<P>
- Summary -
</CENTER>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>I</B></FONT>n 1982, an Israeli government inquiry was established to
examine the enforcement of law in the occupied territories. The
commission, headed by Deputy Attorney General Yehudit Karp, found
"substantial deficiencies" in the way the police handled offenses
imputed to Jewish residents in the territories. The commission
report warned that these omissions were "symptomatic of a deeper
problem, which contains within it the seeds of a dangerous process
whose end cannot be known". 
<P>
      This report reveals that more than a decade after the Karp
Report, not only is the work of the police still characterized by
the same omissions, but the conduct of the army, the State
Attorney's Office, and the courts also reflect an ongoing policy of
biased and partial law enforcement with regards to settlers in the
occupied territories. The Hebron massacre, twelve years later, is
but the most extreme consequence of a persisting environment in
which illegal acts by Israeli civilians in the occupied territories
have been handled with marked neglect by Israeli authorities. 
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1>Amongst the main findings:</FONT></B>
<UL>
<LI> <B>IDF</B> - As the sovereign authority in the area, the IDF has not
fulfilled its duty to protect the Palestinian population. Concrete
steps have not been taken to prevent violent or illegal acts by
settlers against Palestinians or intervene once they began. For
example, on numerous instances over recent months, leaders of
settler organizations publicly announced plans to block access to
Palestinian vehicles on public roads; yet, the army did not
intervene in these unlawful activities. On numerous other
occasions, army troops did not intervene when settlers shot towards
Palestinian residents or caused damage to their property. IDF
officers have testified at the commission of inquiry into the
Hebron massacre that army orders forbid soldiers from firing at
settlers, even in cases when the settlers were unlawfully shooting
at Palestinian residents. 
<P> 
<LI> <B>Police</B> - There are serious deficiencies in the way the police treat
offenses allegedly committed by Israeli settlers against
Palestinians in the territories. In many cases -- including those
involving fatalities -- even the most rudimentary of investigations
have not been conducted. 
<P>
     As a rule, incidents in which no complaint is filed are not
investigated, even if the police receive information from external
sources. Police often refuse to accept complaints from
Palestinians, or hinder their efforts to do so. In other cases the
police deny ever receiving a complaint, even when representatives
of local human rights organizations had accompanied the complainant
and been present when the complaint was made. If an investigation
is begun, the closing of the file on the grounds of "offender
unknown" is commonplace -- even when there are prima facie details
identifying the offender. 
<P>
     Commonly, the police investigation drag on for two years and
more, or files are held up for long periods in the police
Prosecutions Department. This foot-dragging has serious
consequences: a protracted investigation makes it more difficult to
locate witnesses and reduces their ability to remember details of
the incident. If, or when, the investigation is completed, the
delay influences the decision of the State Attorney's Office on
whether to submit an indictment.
<P>
<LI><B>The Courts</B> - The Israeli government has installed two systems of
justice -- based on national identity -- toward perpetrators of
crimes in the territories. Palestinians suspected of committing
violence against Israelis are tried before a military court;
Israeli citizens suspected of committing violent actions against
Palestinians are tried before a civilian court inside Israel.
<P>
     The charges brought against Jewish settlers have been
disproportionately light relative to the severity of the crimes
they alledgedly committed. In most cases, including those involving
fatalities, the penalties are incommensurate with the gravity of
the offense.  
<P> 
     Israeli settlers convicted in courts inside Israel for crimes
perpetrated against Palestinians generally received lighter
sentences than Palestinians convicted of the same crimes against
Jews. The grounds cited by judges for the punishment frequently
reflect a nationalist bias.
</UL> 
     The repeated failures of the various authorities to enforce
the law vis-a-vis the settlers suggest the existence of a policy
bordering on tacit consent to the violence perpetrated by these
individuals. B'Tselem calls on the Israeli government to take steps
to ensure that the rule of law is applied promptly, thoroughly, and
impartially.

</CENTER>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>I</B></FONT>n November 1989 B'Tselem published a 
report on the military judicial
system in the West Bank.  With the help of seven Israeli attorneys,
we followed the judicial process over a period of eight months,
from the moment of the West Bank residents' detention right through
to the ruling in the military courts.  Since publication of the
report, B'Tselem continued monitoring the judicial system and
visited courts in Ramallah, Nablus and Hebron.  In this
Information Sheet the primary conclusions of the November 1989
report are reviewed, as well as the changes observed in the course
of our visits to the courts.  The Information Sheet also contains
the IDF Spokesperson's response to B'Tselem's report as received
by our office in March 1990. 
<P>
B'Tselem closely monitored the changes and improvements which
took place in the military courts on the West Bank, and
observed trials in Ramallah, Hebron, and Nablus.  The conclusions
of our follow-up deal chiefly with improvements and changes that
took place concerning the attendance of witnesses and defendants in
court.  According to the IDF Spokesperson's statistics, 88.15% of
defendants and 55.75% of witnesses appeared at regular trials in
January 1990.  This is indeed a significant increase in the
percentage of attendance at court since the publication of B'Tselem's
report in November 1989.
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=+1> Conclusions of the Followup: </FONT></B><BR>
The rights granted residents of the territories by 
Israeli military law were minimal at best and fell short of the
rights of suspects and defendants within Israel.  It is thus
essential to protect these basic rights.
<P>
The IDF response made it clear that the army was aware of
the delays and injustices inflicted upon thousands of
Palestinian suspects and defendants.  The IDF Spokesperson ascribed
this, to a great extent, to the workload which burdened the system.
<P>
The external appearance of the courthouses, the filth, the disorder,
the lack of punctuality, the fact that no one knew which cases
would be heard or which postponed, the degrading treatment of lawyers
who spent long hours in courtyards, without room, public phone,
or a drinking tap on hot days were all symptomatic of the judicial
process within the courtroom itself.
<P>
The lack of photocopying machines at the disposal of lawyers, made
it impossible to photocopy court records or to prepare a proper
defence.  The courts set dates for bail hearings, which meant that
detainees were held until their trial, a period which was weeks
long.
<P>
Improvements in the system, such as establishment of a new court
in Jenin and the new "expedited trials," led to the "closing of
cases" at a quicker pace than in the past.  The impression was
left that the military court, as a result of the pressure it was
under, began measuring its effectiveness in terms of productivity. 
Although a court must close cases, it must also determine guilt
based on legitimate evidence and witnesses, use predetermined
legal procedures, maintain an atmosphere of respect, preserve the
rights of defendants and their attorneys, and take into account
the feelings of defendants' families.

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>T</B></FONT>he report includes the following sections:
<OL>
<LI> Introduction; 
<LI> Sources of the study; 
<LI> The legal foundation of the West Bank judicial system; 
<LI> Detention: The legal basis for detention, non-notification
     of arrest and place of incarceration, visits by lawyers to prisons,
     and extending detention; 
<LI> Observations at the Ramallah military courts: physical conditions,
     postponement of trials, release on bail, and the judicial process;
<LI> Conclusions.
</OL>
The Military Advocate General reported at a press conference on
October 19, 1989, that since the beginning of the Intifada, security
forces had made 40,000 arrests in the territories. Of those arrested,
18,000 Palestinians were actually tried before military courts.
From the data provided by the Military Advocate General it is
apparent that, at the writing of the report, the judicial system
was heavily burdened, and that despite the increase in personnel
in recent years, the system was collapsing under the weight of
the large numbers of detainees and judicial proceedings.
<P>
This report examines the functioning of the military judicial system
on the West Bank in relation to the law governing the territories. 
The report is divided into two parts, the first based on interviews
with lawyers, prosecutors and military judges, and the second part
focuses on observations in the Ramallah courts conducted over a
period of eight months with the help of seven Israeli lawyers.
<P>
The report deals only with instances in which judicial proceedings
actually took place.  Nevertheless, it is important to remember
that many of the imprisoned Palestinians do not reach the courts,
but are imprisoned for a period of administrative detention without
being brought to court.  The military commander has the right to
order administrative detention if there is "a reasonable basis
to suppose that regional security or public security necessitate
that the person should be imprisoned."  According to the data
provided by the Military Advocate General, since the beginning
of the Intifada until the report was issued, more than 9,000
administrative detentions had been ordered.  Since August 1989
until the writing of the report it had been possible to impose
12 months of detention without judicial review, instead of the
six month limit which was previously in effect. 
<P>
The failure of the system of military justice reviewed was both
behavioral institutional and legal.  Two failings stand out in
particular.  The first is the significant injustice that is caused
on a routine basis by inexplicable inefficiency, unjustifiable
indifference, and lack of initiative.  The repeated postponement
of trials resulting from the failure to produce prisoners and
witnesses, coupled with the widespread phenomenon of plea-bargaining,
undermine the principle that the defendant should not be denied
his freedom (for an extended period) before his guilt is properly
established.  The second failing is the existence of IDF procedures
which violate the law.  The basic rights granted residents of the
territories by orders of the military commander are not protected. 
These violations are not occasional, but are rather ingrained in
military procedures.

Between the beginning of the Intifada and the end of
October 1989, 569 Palestinians were killed in the territories in
incidents involving Israeli security forces.  During this period,
the public had been exposed to hundreds of reports of beatings,
abuses, and damage to property perpetrated by IDF troops and other
security forces in the territories.
<P>
In many of these cases, an investigation was begun, and in some
of them soldiers were indicted.  Official sources report that
from October 10, 1989 - November 1, 1989, 52 indictments against
86 soldiers had been issued to the military courts.   These soldiers
were accused of various offenses, including manslaughter, causing
death through negligence, assault, criminal physical abuse,
conduct unbecoming, theft, and others.  In 43 cases the proceedings
had concluded:  63 soldiers were convicted and 9 were acquitted. 
In addition, according to the Judge Advocate General, 500 -
600 soldiers had disciplinary proceedings brought against them.
<P>
With the occupation of the territories in 1967 and up to and
including the date of this report, the West Bank and Gaza Strip
were declared closed areas, requiring permission to enter or leave.
<P>
A resident of the territories wishing to travel abroad had
to apply to the internal staff officer of the Civil
Administration where he lived and request an exit permit.  At the
administrative offices, he received a 'travel form,' and with this
form he had to go through a series of administrative offices and
receive an endorsement from each of them -- in the form of a stamp
on the 'travel form' -- that he did not owe money and that he
is not wanted by security forces.
<P>
When the permit was granted, the person went to the border station
(the majority of those who left the territories did so via the
bridges, a small minority through the border crossing at Rafah,
Ben Gurion airport, or the Port of Haifa), and there
-- if everything went right -- the exit permit was signed.

- Summary -
</CENTER>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>T</B></FONT>he methods of interrogation used by the Israeli General Security
Service (GSS) against Palestinian detainees were previously
surveyed in four B'Tselem reports.   In its 1991 comprehensive
report on the subject, B'Tselem concluded that "according to all
official criteria, these methods of interrogation ... belong to
the category of torture."  
<P>
This report provides an up-to-date picture of the GSS's and
Israel Defense Force's interrogation methods. It includes
testimony and affidavits of Palestinians interrogated by the GSS
and IDF in recent months. The report also presents testimony of
GSS agents given in the course of suppression hearings (mini-
trials), which are held when the accused contends that a
confession was extracted by unlawful means and is, therefore,
inadmissible. When such a contention is made, the court
interrupts the trial regarding the criminal charge and determines
whether to sustain the accused's claim.
<P>
In one mini-trial, District Court Judge Moshe Talgam wrote in his
decision of March 9, 1994 disallowing the confession of a
Palestinian defendant:
<PRE>  
     The interrogators testified, and completely denied that
     there had been any physical injury, but they admitted that
     the interrogations were lengthy, and that it was possible
     that the defendant was not allowed to rest for seventy-two
     hours [...] I have no doubt that under the system in which
     interrogators rotate, and interrogate the defendant for
     twenty-four hours consecutively once, and for nearly forty-
     eight hours consecutively a second time, the interrogee
     experiences very great suffering (Mini-trial in Criminal
     File 201/93).
</PRE><P>
The U.N. Convention Against Torture, ratified by Israel, defines
"torture" as "any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether
physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person..."
(Art. 1)
<P>
In citing the language of the Convention Against Torture, the
Israel District Court joined a long list of human rights
organizations that have stated in recent years that the methods
of interrogation used by the GSS constitute, at least in their
cumulative effect over time, torture according to the criteria
employed by the international community. 
<P>
As this report reveals, sleep deprivation is only one of numerous
methods which the GSS admits using. The GSS admits to routinely
employing methods that degrade and humiliate detainees, impair
their physical and mental health, and cause them great pain. 
<P>
Testimonies of Palestinians, as well as testimonies by GSS agents
and police officers, confirm that the following interrogation
methods continue to be used by the security forces when
interrogating Palestinians:
<OL>
<LI>   Insults and abuse
<LI>   Threats to harm the detainee or his family  
<LI>   Sleep and food deprivation 
<LI>   Covering the head with a sack for hours, and even days
<LI>   Imprisoning the detainee in solitary confinement, sometimes
     while in a painful position
<LI>   Tying up the detainee for extended periods in painful
     positions
<LI>   Use of collaborators to extract information or a confession,
     by or with the threat of violence 
<LI>   Forced physical exercise
<LI>   Imprisonment under extreme heat, cold or filth
<LI>  Severe blows to the body with fists, sticks and other
     instruments
</OL>
Notwithstanding recent political developments in the region, it
is difficult to discern any improvement regarding interrogation
methods. The habitual use of torture in the interrogation of
Palestinians continues.
<P>
Of the nine Palestinians who were interviewed for this report,
seven were released without any criminal charges being filed
against them, one was sentenced to seven months in prison, and
one is still awaiting trial. The repeated claim that "pressure"
was used against detainees because of the need to prevent
murderous attacks is a mere pretext in these cases; the same is
true of the overwhelming majority of cases in which detainees are
tortured. In any event, the interrogation methods are
inconsistent with the categorical prohibition of torture.
<P>
The report also includes a brief analysis of the interrogation of
Jewish settlers suspected of activities in the "Underground"
organization.       
<P>
In November 1994, the Ministerial Committee on GSS Matters
decided to permit GSS interrogators to use additional methods of
pressure during interrogations of Palestinians.
<P>
B'Tselem is of the opinion that not only are additional methods
unwarranted, but that the use of any method contrary to
international law must be prohibited. The government of Israel
must take urgent steps that will put an end, once and for all, to
the torture of detainees under interrogation.

<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>O</B></FONT>n April 25, 1992, in an affidavit to the High Court of Justice,
the head of the General Security Service (GSS; Hebrew: "Shin Bet"
or "shabak") described the changes that had been introduced in
the procedure for interrogating security detainees.  The details
of the "new procedure" were contained in a second, classified
affidavit.
<P>
The "new procedure" is meant to revise the interrogation methods
laid down by a state commission of inquiry headed by Justice Moshe
Landau in 1987, which permitted, among other methods, the use of
"psychological pressure" and "a moderate measure of physical
pressure."  
<P>
In the open part of his affidavit, the head of the GSS informed
the High Court that a "new procedure" had been introduced on April
22, 1993 in accordance with the recommendations of a ministerial
committee set up to consider the subject.  Underlying the "new
procedure" are the principles "already set forth by the Landau
Commission" (par. 15). 
<P>
Even according to the head of the GSS himself, the new procedure
continues to incorporate, "within the limits of the law," the
"special interrogation procedures which were recommended by the
Landau Commission" (par. 7). 
<P>
The principal changes in the "new procedure" are that it makes
the use of certain methods of interrogation conditional on the
existence of particular suspicions, and requires the approval at
higher echelons of the GSS. Nevertheless, it is GSS personnel who
determine the essence of the suspicion and also approve the use
of the various methods.
<P>
Through a police officer in charge of investigation who serves
as the official cover before whom the confession is signed, the
GSS personnel, without intervention, without supervision, and indeed
without the knowledge of any external authority, determine that
the suspicions are sufficiently grave to warrant holding the detainee
in total isolation from the outside world for fourteen days and
to subject him to the harsh interrogation methods approved by the
Landau Commission.
<P>
The "new procedure" gives the GSS exclusive power to determine
the severity of the means which it may employ, as well as deciding
when outside elements may supervise its actions.
<P>
GSS members make these decisions based on suspicion alone, and
are not obligated to substantiate them, unlike, for example, an
ordinary request for extension of detention. There is thus no
possibility, even after the fact, of accusing the interrogators
of unnecessarily extending the period of detention in isolation
or of using severe methods not in accordance with the regulations.
<P>
The report gives the testimony of 'Abd a-Nasser 'Ubeid, taken on
September 17, 1993.  'Ubeid was detained on August 30, 1993 and
held for seventeen days.  He was subjected to an interrogation
which was conducted under the "new procedure" in which GSS
interrogators and Palestinian collaborators working in complete
collusion with the GSS made use of the following methods:
<OL>
<LI> Making the detainee stand with hands tied, often blindfolded
and in painful positions, for hours on end.
<LI> Sleep deprivation.
<LI> Deprivation of food and drink.
<LI> Threats to his and his family's life.
<LI> Threats and sexual harassment.
<LI> Holding the detainee in extreme conditions of filth (no changes
of clothing and denial of a shower for ten days).
<LI> Slaps, kicks, blows and burning of the arm with a lit cigarette.
</OL>
'Ubeid's testimony as well as other testimonies cited in this report
and testimonies in the possession of other human-rights groups,
indicate that the "new procedure" has not fundamentally altered
the behavior of the interrogators toward Palestinian detainees.
<P>
The report concludes with a series of concrete recommendations
to prevent torture in interrogations.
<P>
<B> Annexes to the report include: </B>
<UL>
<LI>  an excerpt from testimony taken from a reserve soldier in the
Military Police, who served in the spring of 1993 in the
interrogation wing of the military prison at Far'ah, in the northern
sector of the West Bank. The excerpt focuses on the role of
collaborators in interrogations.  
<P>
<LI> excepts from testimony of a Palestinian interrogated in the
Military Prison at Dhahriyya.
</UL>
As with all B'Tselem reports, a response from the IDF spokesperson's
office is appended to the report.

</OL>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>W</B></FONT>e regret to say that in March 1992 there had been little real
change in the pattern of interrogation of Palestinian suspects. 
The methods we described in our original report continued to be
used in March 1992 in a widespread and routine way.  This was
confirmed by every source we could find: journalists' investigations;
hundreds of cases reported to human rights organizations and lawyers;
the 24 members of our original group whom we re-interviewed and
our 25 new interviews.  These methods certainly constituted ill-
treatment and corresponded to most accepted definitions of torture. 
The military court system continued to have little or no control
over abuses in the interrogation process. 
<P>
Only one serious attempt was made by an official Israeli government
authority to investigate our allegations.  This was the IDF inquiry
headed by Maj. Gen. Vardi.  The results of this inquiry largely
substantiated our claims--at least in regard to IDF investigations. 
Vardi's recommendation however--to shift interrogations from the
IDF to the GSS--hardly dealt with the overall problem, nor did
it clarify the division of responsibility between the IDF and the
GSS.
<P>
Even a "proper investigation" was insufficient as long as there
was no real public commitment by the Israeli government to actually
try to eradicate the torture and ill-treatment of Palestinian
suspects.  What had become apparent over 1992, was that no official
source even bothered anymore to deny the existence of the illegal
methods of interrogation that B'Tselem (and other organizations)
had consistently reported.

</OL>
This report deals with the subject of ill-treatment, violence and
torture against Palestinians detained for interrogation during
the first three years of the Intifada.  We cover allegations about
interrogations carried out primarily by agents of General Security
Services (Shin Bet or Shabak) in installations (in the West Bank
and Gaza) which were controlled either by the police, the Israeli
Prison Service or the Army. 
<P>
In Part A of the Report, we review definitions of torture, and
cruel and inhuman treatment.  We review the consequences of the
1987 Report of the Landau Commission which established that G.S.S.
agents had systematically lied to the court about using force to
extract confessions.  Though condemning this practice, the Commission
went on to permit the use of "moderate physical force" as a method
of interrogation.  We criticize the legal and moral basis of the
Commission's reasoning and point at the grave implications of
removing the sanction against force.  We summarize previous
allegations about the use of torture and ill-treatment.  Although
methods of collecting information are not always reliable, these
reports show beyond reasonable doubt that practices definable as
ill-treatment or torture had been used against Palestinian detainees. 
<P>
In Part B, we set out the findings of our own research into
interrogation methods used by the G.S.S. between 1988 and 1990. 
We interviewed 41 detainees: 29 from the West Bank and 12 from
Gaza; these include 26 who had recently been released and 15 who
were still under detention.  A number of interrogation methods
appear to have been common, even routine in the group we interviewed.
<P>
Virtually all our sample were subject to: verbal abuse, humiliation
and threats of injury; sleep and food deprivation; hooding for
prolonged periods; enforced standing for long periods, sometimes
in an enclosed space; prolonged periods of confinement in small,
specially constructed cells and severe and prolonged beating on
all parts of the body.  
<P>
How representative is the experience of the 41 detainees?  According
to the I.D.F. (February 1991), some 75,000 Palestinians had been
arrested during the first three years of the Intifada, of whom
a yearly average of 15,000 were actually charged each year.  We
estimate that the majority of these were not interrogated intensely
or over long periods, and were released within the first 18-day
phase.  Others were tried in "quick trials" on the basis of evidence
by the arresting soldier alone.  Our estimate is that some 1,600
detainees per year would undergo interrogation, including some
combination of the practices we describe.

<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>T</B></FONT>he "Hotline for Victims of Violence" was formed in the summer
of 1988, with the institutionalization of the Intifada, as a project
of the "tolerance" movement.  A year and a half later, when the
Hotline became an independent body, it was renamed "Hotline: Center
for the Defense of the Individual," and rapidly assumed an important
place among the various groups whose aim is to preserve the rule
of law and to protect the rights of residents of the State of Israel
and those living under its rule.
<P>
The outbreak of the Intifada brought with it a significant increase
in human rights violations against Palestinian residents of the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip. This situation has led to the formation
of various organizations that aim to assist residents of the
territories in many different ways.  "Hotline:  Center for the
Defense of the Individual," was established in Jerusalem in July
1988 in order to aid residents of the territories in their contacts
with Israeli authorities.
<P>
The Hotline deals with a wide range of human rights violations
committed in the territories by assisting residents of the
territories in lodging complaints or requests to the appropriate
authorities, and by attempting to ensure that such complaints are
investigated in a serious manner and that the authorities take
the appropriate actions warranted by the results of the
investigation.  In addition, the Hotline assists residents of the
territories with representation in court and seeks to obtain
compensation for bodily injury and property damages for those
complainants who so desire.
<P>
Over the three years until the writing of this report, the
Hotline processed more than 2,000 complaints by residents of the
territories.  This report illustrates, through a description of
these complaints, the central patterns of human rights
abuses inflicted upon the residents of the territories in their
dailylives.  The report focuses on the main issues dealt with by
the Hotline:  location of detainees and conditions of detention; 
confiscation of identity cards;  entry and exit permits;  and
violence and damage to property.  The response to the report by
the Ministry of Justice is included in the report.
<P>
Note: The Hotline is now called HaMoked: Center for the Defense
of the Individual.  For more information on their activities, the
organization can be contacted at:<BR>

<OL>

<LI> Legal perspective;
<LI> Budget of the Territories - sources and revenues;
<LI> Taxation during the Uprising;
<LI> Conclusions;

</OL>
This report deals with the system of taxation in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip during the Intifada period.  Its purpose is to
examine changes made to the system from 1989-1990, a period
which saw a significant drop in the income of the
residents, growing alienation between them and the government,
and the launch of a widespread overt and covert tax rebellion.
<P>
In democratic countries, taxes are imposed by an elected government,
giving the voters at least some feeling  of control over the amount
of tax they are expected to pay. In the case of a region under
foreign military occupation, the residents cannot have any say
in decisions concerning taxation. In such circumstances, the issue
of taxation takes on special political significance, becoming a
focus for friction between the occupier and the occupied.  The
former regards taxation as a legitimate means of financing the
needs of the population, while the latter perceives it as oppressive
and coercive.  The occupying government should, therefore, exercise
extreme caution and discretion with respect to fiscal measures. 
<P>
This report attempts to answer the following questions:
<OL>
<LI> Were actions being taken which contravened legal regulations
and orders?
<LI> Did the tax laws applied in the territories comply with
the spirit of the law?
<LI> What were the measures employed to enforce the tax laws?
<LI> What were the results of such enforcement?
</OL>
The report briefly surveys the legal aspects of tax collection
in the territories, with reference to the pertinent provisions
of international law and to the changes implemented in the local
law of the West Bank and Gaza Strip under Israeli rule.
<P>
The report goes on to present background data on the budget of
the occupied territories, tax revenues, and the ratio of taxes to
GNP. 
<P>
The report primarily addresses the situation vis-a-vis taxation
which arose in the wake of the uprising.  It describes the
system of tax collection in use since the start of the uprising
until February 1990 and the measures employed to maintain it. 
Some typical cases were selected from documented complaints to
illustrate the way the system works.  Finally, the norms of
enforcement and appeal which were in force in the territories are
compared with those which were in use in Israel.
<P>
The report does not purport to deal with the entire range of fiscal
matters in the territories.  Rather, it aims to examine the use
made of taxation in the territories, and to indicate  the policy,
objectives, and use of taxation in a situation of popular insurgency.

<B>Special Report: Prison Facilities </B>
<UL>

<LI> IDF prisons
<LI> Differences among the various facilities
<LI> Typical problems in prisons

</UL>

Estimates put the total number of Palestinian prisoners from
the beginning of the Intifada until the end of July 1989 at around
50,000 persons. 
<P>
The types of prisons where Palestinians were detained are
Prison Service facilities, Israel Police facilities, and facilities
under IDF authority, which include, in the territories: Tulkarm,
Fara'a, Anatot, Opher, Dvir (Dahariya), Gaza Coast Compound (Ansar
2), and Khan Yunis; in Israel, Megiddo and Ketsiot (Ansar 3). 
This category, prisons run by the IDF both in Israel and in the
territories, is the subject of this inquiry.
<P>
The network of military prisons was made up of facilities
designed for short-term imprisonment, in which prisoners were
supposed to be kept until the end of the legal proceedings against
them. There was also a small number of facilities designed for
long-term confinement which were supposed to hold convicted prisoners
and administrative detainees. The heavy pressure on the military
courts which delayed and drew out the court proceedings against
residents of the territories, and the overcrowding in the long-term
prison facilities were the reasons that, in many cases, prisoners
were held for long periods in short-term facilities which did not
provide the necessary conditions for long-term confinement. In
addition to the network of official prison facilities, the IDF
made use of the facilities of the Military Government of Judea,
Samaria and the Gaza Strip, as lock-up facilities for temporary
detainees as well as for persons who had been charged and were
in the process of a hastened judicial procedure. In these facilities
the prisoners were kept in conditions that did not meet the minimal
acceptable requirements for persons held in custody.  The number
of prisoners held in them was not reported and, because these were
not official facilities, there were no official criteria applied
in their administration.
<P>
To the best of our knowledge, lawyers were not permitted to
enter these facilities. According to evidence given to us, the
treatment of prisoners in these facilities appeared to be
particularly bad.
<P>
Typical problems in prisons included overcrowding, inadequate
sleeping arrangements, indecent arrangements for eating (i.e. no
chairs or tables provided), washing arrangements which were not
consistent throughout the prison system (i.e., in Dahariya, prisoners
are allowed to shower twice a week, while in Ofer the prisoners
have the use of a shower at all times), unvaried food lacking in
fresh fruit and vegetables, spices and coffee, a frequent water
shortage in the Gaza Coast Compound and in Block 1 of Ketsiot,
and unsatisfactory conditions for meeting lawyers.  Other problems
were a delay in distribution of newspapers and mail, and the
censoring of books and newspapers. 
<P>
The Army Spokesperson's Office reported that from the beginning
of the Intifada to the end of June 1989, 6 prisoners who were
residents of the territories were killed at Ketsiot prison by fellow
prisoners who suspected them of collaborating with the authorities
or of "immoral activity" (Palestinian term). The Army Spokesperson
did not give us data on prisoners killed by fellow prisoners in
other prison facilities.  There are at least another 9 cases of
prison deaths where there is a suspicion that the prison authorities
or GSS personnel were involved, directly or indirectly.
<P>
Until the writing of this report, in most of the arrests,
the prisoners were not allowed to inform their families of their
arrest, nor was the family notified within 48 hours through the
Civil Administration. In a number of cases, the family was notified
through the Red Cross, but in most cases many days elapsed before
the notification reaches the family. Over and above the natural
anxiety and uncertainty regarding the whereabouts of the prisoner,
there is the need for the family to know of his arrest in order
to secure the services of a lawyer to represent him.

</CENTER>
<P>

<B>SETTLERS</B> - The month of June 1989 saw an escalation in actions
initiated by Jewish settlers in the territories, against the
Palestinian population. For the first time settlers living in the
territories took action within the Green Line (within the borders
of the State of Israel), against Palestinians. A number of incidents
in which settlers attacked journalists and IDF soldiers were
recorded. Only in a few cases were arrests reported. A list of
the incidents is included in the information sheet. 
<P>
<B>INQUIRY</B> - On June 18 Salah el Bah'sh, age 17, was killed by IDF
soldiers, by shooting, in the Nablus Casbah, between 8 and 9 am.
The Army Spokesperson told journalists that the youngster was fired
on after he had pretended to draw his identity card from his pocket,
and then suddenly struck one of the soldiers and fled. According
to the IDF Spokesperson, El Bah'sh did not stop when the soldiers
called out "Halt!", and he was then fired upon ('Hadashot' June
19). The results of an inquiry conducted by B'Tselem and ACRI
(Association for Civil Rights in Israel) present a different picture,
in which Salah eventually halted and was shot while raising his
hands. He was killed by a rubber bullet. 
<P>
<B>DEPORTATIONS</B> - On June 13 1989, the Chief of Staff told the Knesset
Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that the IDF and the Ministry
of Justice were examining the possibility of shortening the process
of deportations from the territories, by speeding up the hearings
of appeals to the High Court. According to the Chief of Staff,
they were also examining the possibility of deportations being
carried out before the hearings are completed: if the High Court
ruled against deportation then the plaintiff would be permitted
to return. On June 29 1989, 8 residents of the territories were
deported to Lebanon. From 1967 to July 1989, the number of persons
deported by Israel from the territories totals 1253, 53 of them
since the beginning of the Intifada until the writing of this report,
among them students, journalists, university lecturers, lawyers
and teachers. The deportees, generally speaking, formed part of
the political leadership, on the local or national level. The reasons
generally given for deportations were incitement, political
subversion, active membership in banned organizations and so on.
The security establishment did not employ deportation as a punishment
for terrorist activities.
<P>
The legal perspective on the deporations is discussed.

</UL>
In May 1989, 35 Palestinian residents were killed, and one
Israeli soldier.  In May, 2 children under 12 years of age , and
6 youths aged 13-16 were killed. Of note is the high number of
deaths among persons aged 40 or more, 4 in all, one of them a woman
aged 50 years. The rise in the number of fatalities, which began
in March 1989, continued. Half of those killed in May were from
the Gaza Strip, whereas in the past the proportion was generally
about one third of the total. The trend of Palestinians killing
Palestinians thought to be collaborators continued. 
<P>
61 of the Palestinians killed from August 1988 - March 1989
died as a result of the use of plastic bullets.  The Deputy Chief
of Staff, General Ehud Barak, justified the IDF's use of plastic
bullets in dealing with rioters. In his deposition, the Deputy
Chief of Staff declared: "Because of the characteristics of the
plastic bullet, which are quite different from those of live
ammunition, the correct use of this bullet, at certain distances
is not supposed to be fatal." The testimonies of officers in the
reserves, included in the information sheet, reveal that the training
in the use of plastic bullets was perfunctory, and that it was
difficult to follow the guidelines for shooting. 
<P>
There was a resumption of house demolitions in May 1989.  The
information sheet includes B'Tselem's investigation in El-Arub
refugee camp.
<P>
During 1989, the imposing of curfew was also used as a sweeping
collective punitive measure. Imposing a curfew is clearly
a collective punishment, thus contravening the international law
which prevailed in the territories.
<P>
The month of May 1989 was marked by an escalation of action
taken by settlers against Palestinians, in reaction to attacks
on vehicles travelling in Judea and Samaria. Although these actions
were planned in advance and well organized, neither the police
nor the IDF took sufficient action to prevent such occurrences.
In most of the  cases where there was a confrontation between
settlers and IDF soldiers, punitive and deterrent action was not
taken against the settlers.
<P>
At the beginning of May 1989 we received information concerning
an outbreak of Brucellosis in a small village, Ras Atiya, not far
from Kalkilya. Brucellosis, known also as 'Malta Fever', is a severe
illness that afflicts sheep and goats, and is passed to humans
through the affected milk. Complications of the disease can cause
paralysis of the limbs. The villagers complained that the Civil
Administration had given instructions to the Government Hospital
at Tul-Karem not to hospitalize the sick, unless they paid the
hospitalization fee of twenty shekels per day. The order was given
because most of the villagers do not have medical insurance through
the Civil Administration. B'tselem's findings were published in
the press, and the main points were relayed verbally to
senior officials of the Civil Administration. Within a week members
of the Civil Administration came to Ras Atiya, arranged for medical
care for the villagers, and began work on eradicating the disease
among the flocks.

<B>422</B> Palestinians, inhabitants of the territories, were killed in
the period from the beginning of the Intifada in December 1987
until the end of April 1989, by soldiers of the Israel Defence
Forces and by Israeli civilians. 391 were killed by live ammunition,
including plastic bullets, 15 of them children less than 12 years
old, 59 aged 13-16. 31 were killed as a result of beatings, burns
and other injuries not caused by live ammunition, 3 of them children
less than 12 years, 2 aged 13-16 years. A further 70 deaths occurred
a short time after exposure to tear gas, 27 of whom were infants.
From a medical point of view it is difficult to determine that
exposure to tear gas is the direct and sole cause of death. 
<P>
In this period 4 IDF soldiers and 9 Israeli civilians were killed,
3 of them infants. In April 1989, two thirds of the deaths occured
in the West Bank, one third in the Gaza Strip.  27 of the April
killings, the majority, occured in the 17 days between 13-28 April,
8 of them in the Bethlehem district, an area which had been till
then relatively quiet.  Despite the 'official ending' of the policy
of beatings, almost every month at least one death due to beating
was recorded. A total of 17 residents of the territories were killed
by Israeli civilians.  (The number of deaths reported is based
on information from both Israeli and Palestinian sources, together
with information collected by workers of the center. It is
difficult to establish precisely the number of Palestinians killed.
The data published by the center is the best assessment possible.)
<P>
From the partial data in our possession we know of nearly
700 houses that had been demolished since the beginning of
the Intifada until the writing of this report. 50 additional houses
had been sealed, as punishment for security offenses. 
<P>
From December 1987 to May 1, 1989, 45 Palestinian residents had
been deported.
<P>
Deportation orders were pending for 13 residents (details of name,
age, occupation, and family status are given in the informaiton
sheet.)
<P>
According to military sources, approximately 1020 men and women
were being held in administrative detention at the writing of this
sheet. (Approximately 5000 others were imprisoned, some
following trial and conviction, some held prior to being brought
to trial, and some held till the conclusions of proceedings against
them.)  According to the military sources, since the beginning
of the Intifada a total of 4500 residents of the territories had
been held in administrative detention.
<P>
The information sheet includes the investigation of two killing
incidents by the IDF in the Dehaishe Refugee Camp, based on
testimonies of residents of Dehaishe.  The first incident involved
Nasser Ibrahim Elkassas, 16.  The second involved Rafaida Abu Laban,
14.  These incidents raise some questions:
<OL TYPE=a>
<LI> In the two cases the youths were shot from behind, when the soldiers were
not endangered by them;
<LI> In at least one of the incidents the youth was not ordered to halt, and no warning shots were fired
before the fatal shots were fired.
</OL>
<BR>
Every resident of the West Bank and Gaza, over the age of
16, is obliged by order to carry his identity card with him.
A resident without his identity card commits a criminal offense
and can be arrested. A frequently occurring phenomenon around the
time of the writing of this report was the confiscation of identity
cards from inhabitants of the territories, in order to force them
to pay income tax or to report the military government and sometimes
apparently simply for the sake of harassment. The Association for
Civil Rights in Israel submitted a petition to the High Court of
Justice on behalf of seven residents of the territories whose
identity cards were confiscated and not returned. Responding to
the petition to the High Court, a representative for the Attorney
General, said there was no legal basis for the confiscating of
identity cards. (The affidavits of 3 of the 7 residents are included
in the information sheet.)

<p>
We, faculty members of Israel's institutions of higher education, urge the Israeli government to enable some 1,200 Gaza students to reach their schools in the West Bank.
<P>
We maintain that "security considerations" cannot justify a sweeping and collective restriction on hundreds of persons, particularly since they only need to cross a short distance through Israeli territory, which can be easily arranged and secured.
<P>
We believe that education is a fundamental right, and that preventing Gaza students from exercising this right not only harms the individual students, but also impedes the advancement and development of Palestinian society as a whole.  Consequently, the chances for peace between the two peoples is also harmed.

<TITLE> B'Tselem, Shaken to Death: Torture in Interrogation </TITLE>

<HR>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>A</B></FONT>bed a-Samed Harizat, a resident of Hebron, was detained on 22
April 1995 and taken to Jerusalem for interrogation.  During his
interrogation he lost consciousness and was taken to the hospital. 
He died on April 26.  His autopsy revealed that Harizat died as
a result of brain damage caused by violent shaking during
interrogation.  This was the first time that the Government publicly
attributed the death of a Palestinian in custody to interrogation
methods.
<P>
Violent shaking or whiplashing - in which an interrogator grabs
the detainee by the clothes or shoulders - has become the most
common form of violence experienced by GSS detainees.  It can cause
severe neck pain, loss of consciousness, as well as permanent brain
injury.  Dr. Robert Kirschner, a forensic pathologist and a
specialist in shaking injuries in children, submitted an affidavit
to the Israeli High Court of Justice which explained that shaking
produces a differential motion between the skull and the brain,
such that the brain continues in motion after the head has stopped
moving.
<P>
The State Attorney, Dorit Beinish, in consultation with the Attorney
General, Michael Ben-Yair, decided not to file criminal charges
against those responsible for Harizat's death; instead she decided
to subject one interrogator to internal disciplinary proceedings.
<P>
In response to this decision, B'Tselem published a notice in the
Israeli press calling for the criminal prosecution of all those
responsible for Harizat's death.  B'Tselem was joined by three
other organizations in publishing this notice: HaMoked: Center
for the Defence of the Individual, the Public Committee Against
Torture in Israel, and the Association of Israeli-Palestinian
Physicians for Human Rights.
<P>
B'Tselem also retained the services of civil rights attorney Andre
Rosenthal to file an appeal to the Israeli High Court to request
the results of the investigation into Harizat's death.  In addition,
B'Tselem, together with the Association for Civil Rights in Israel,
sent a letter to the Ministerial Committee which oversees the GSS
including testimonies of Palestinian detainees who were violently
shaken in interrogation and subsequently released without being
charged with any offense.
<P>
The death of Harizat generated a great deal of discussion and 
controversy, both within the media and the public as well as within
the Ministry of Justice, the Knesset and the Inter-Ministerial
Committee which oversees the GSS.  Immediately following Harizat's
death a GSS source claimed that 2,200 Islamist activists had been
detained and interrogated according to the Landau Commission
guidelines, which authorizes the use of "moderate physical pressure"
in interrogations.  Rabin went further in a radio interview and
defended shaking as an effective interrogation method by saying
that "it has been used against 8,000 detainees and there hasn't
been any problem" (Yoman Hashavua - Kol Yisrael, quoted in Ha'aretz
30.7.95).
<P>
The issue of the 1987 Landau Commission and its authorization of
"a moderate amount of physical pressure" came under renewed public
scrutiny.  Both the Justice Minister, Prof. David Libai, and Ben-Yair
expressed support for greater restrictions on interrogation methods. 
In response, Prime Minister Rabin and GSS officers accused Ben-Yair
and others of tying the hands of the GSS in their fight against
terrorism.  Ben-Yair reacted to the criticism by giving an interview
to a legal journal in which he criticized the GSS with unprecedented
candor, stating among other things that the form of shaking used
in interrogations was not what was authorized by the inter-
ministerial committee and that the GSS cannot consider themselves
above the law (see separate box). 
<P>
Despite all of this controversy, the use of torture and other forms
of ill-treatment in interrogations has continued.  Following an
attack which killed several soldiers at a bus stop in January 1995,
the Israeli Government authorized temporary "special permissions"
to enable the GSS to use extraordinary methods in the interrogation
of suspected Islamist extremists.  These special permissions have
been extended several times, most recently in October 1995 for
an additional three months.  The specific methods allowed have
not been made public.  However, the Attorney General stated that
violent shaking is still allowed as a method of interrogation. 
<P>
For the first time, the High Court of Justice recently permitted
the GSS to use physical force, including forceful shaking, against
a Palestinian detainee (see attached press release).  Such a legal
precedent represents an additional set back in the struggle to
outlaw all forms of torture and ill-treatment.

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>B</B></FONT>ecause they speak the truth.  Because they fight for the human
rights of everyone - even Palestinians.  Because they are pure
of mind, pure intentioned and pure in deed ... 
<P>
How could lands marked "empty squares" not be empty, while areas
intended for public construction are taken and constructed solely
for Jews - nothing for the Arabs who had been living there for
generations?  How could they expropriate land from their owners
by machinations that only one who occupies by force would employ?
Or how were solutions found for the growing Jewish population while
the growing Arab population met with bureaucratic neglect and scorn?
<P>
Imagine being an Arab trying to get a building permit - all the
prohibitions, the harassment, the rejections and the arrogant
pretexts; the usual treatment of an occupied population.  Deceit,
cunning, expropriations, various acts of malice, including non-
intervention and lack of enforcement by the courts - and all of
course for the glory of the State of Israel; to proclaim that we
are here, always and above all else - to a tune which is somewhat
familiar and somewhat disturbing.
<P>
Everyone who seeks justice, who cares about honesty, who really
wants to know the truth about the expropriations in East Jerusalem,
should study A Policy of Discrimination.  ...

If someone deserves the Israel Prize, someone who salvages our

<TITLE> B'Tselem, Israel Proposes to Leagalize Torture </TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<CENTER>

<FONT SIZE=+3><B><I> Israel Proposes to Legalize Torture </I></B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>T</B></FONT>he Israeli government has drafted 
a bill to regulate the activities
and authority of the General Security Services (GSS), which up
to now has been regulated by an unwritten system of agreements
between it and other authorities.  Ostensibly such legislation
represents a positive development in terms of Israel's commitment
to human rights and the rule of law.  However, the GSS bill will
in fact legalize the methods of torture and ill-treatment routinely
used by the GSS in interrogations of Palestinians.  
<P>
A section of the GSS Law entitled "Special Interrogation Powers
to Prevent Terrorism" grants GSS interrogators the authority to
apply "pressure" to a detainee if there is a reasonable basis to
believe he has information which could prevent a clear danger to
the state or to human life.  The precise methods of pressure allowed
will be determined by rules which will remain confidential.
<P>
This framework of public guidelines whose details are secret was
established by the Landau Commission, a 1987 Commission of Inquiry
which authorized the GSS to use a "moderate amount of physical
pressure" in interrogations.  A secret annex to the Landau Commission
report details the specific measures allowed.  
<P>
Experience demonstrates that, rather than restricting physical
force to the most extreme situations, such guidelines result in
the routine application of methods constituting torture and ill-
treatment.  In the case of one interrogation method, violent shaking,
the late Prime Minister and Defense Minister, Yitzhak Rabin, stated
that this method had been used against 8,000 Palestinians.  Most
of these detainees were subsequently released with no charges brought
against them.  This suggests that physical force is a standard
rather than an exceptional part of GSS interrogations.
<P>
That the GSS bill would perpetuate the status quo regarding
interrogations of Palestinians is supported by the statement of
a GSS agent given in an interview with the Israeli daily <I>Ha'aretz</I>:
<UL>
     It's all a question of semantics.  The law can prohibit torture
     and humiliation of terrorists suspected of planning and
     conducting attacks and allow increased physical pressure. 
     Ultimately it's almost the same thing.
</UL>
At the same time, by incorporating these methods into law, it would
prevent legal experts and human rights organizations from contesting
their legality under Israeli law.  Currently, many High Court appeals
are based on the assertion that the Landau Commission has no
authority to sanction methods of interrogation which violate the
Israeli penal code; section 277 of the Israeli Penal Code prohibits
the use of force or violence by a public official.  
<P>
Together with the GSS Law, the government proposed an amendment
to the Penal Code to explicitly prohibit torture.  The "Prohibition
of Torture" bill mandates 10-20 years imprisonment for a public
official who uses torture.  However the bill initially defined
torture as "severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental,
<I>with the exception of pain or suffering inherent in interrogation
procedures or punishment according to law</I>" (our emphasis).  This
clause ensured that the vast majority of incidents of torture -
those conducted as part of interrogations - would not be punishable. 
 It appears that as a result of preliminary advocacy by B'Tselem
and other groups, the Attorney General may recommend that this
definition be modified to conform to the International Convention
Against Torture.
<P>
The Prohibition of Torture Law may be used to deflect criticism
away from the GSS Law, and allow the government to claim that it
does not condone torture.  However, the gravity of the GSS Law
cannot be overestimated.  If passed, this law will provide legal
sanction to the methods of torture and ill-treatment routinely
used by the GSS.  Moreover, Israel will become the first country
in the twentieth century to legalize the intentional infliction
of pain and suffering during interrogation.  This would set a
dangerous precedent which could be copied by other countries.  
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>The Need for Action</B></FONT><P>

B'Tselem considers a concerted effort by the Israeli, Palestinian
and international human rights community to be essential to counter
the problematic aspects of both proposed laws.  The approach toward
these bills is as follows: 
<UL>
<LI> To welcome an explicit prohibition against torture in the Israeli
penal code and the regulation of the powers of the GSS by law.
<LI> To strongly oppose any piece of legislation that authorizes
government agents to resort to torture or ill-treatment under any
circumstance. 
</UL>
B'Tselem has organized a coalition of Israeli human rights groups
to coordinate a domestic and international campaign against the
legalization of torture in Israel.

<CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=+3><B><I> B'Tselem Monitors Palestinian Elections </I></B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>O</B></FONT>n January 20 1996, Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza elected
a Council and a Ra'is (president) of the Executive Authority. 
B'Tselem was granted observer status to these elections. Despite
the numerous problems in the election process caused by the
Palestinian Authority, as an Israeli organization B'Tselem monitored
only Israel's involvement in the elections.
<P>
From the standpoint of Israel's obligations, the main problems
centered around East Jerusalem.  As part of its continuing assertion
of unilateral sovereignty over Jerusalem, Israel imposed a great
many restrictions on election campaigning, the freedom of Palestinian
observers and the number of voters inside the city.
<P>
Approximately 50,000 Palestinians were registered to vote in the
Jerusalem district.  However, Israel only allowed some 4,500 persons
to vote inside the Jerusalem municipality.  Consequently, the
overwhelming majority of Palestinians registered to vote in the
district had to leave the city limits to cast their ballot.
<P>
Furthermore, those Palestinians registered to vote inside the city
had to confront a massive police and military presence to reach
their polling site.  Thousands of armed police officers and border
police created an atmosphere of tension at the East Jerusalem post
offices which served as polling stations.  B'Tselem monitors also
observed police officers photographing voters in at least two polling
sites.  This raised the fear among East Jerusalem voters that their
status as permanent residents of Israel would be jeopardized if
they voted. 
<P>
On the day of the elections, police prevented Palestinian observers
from approaching the polling sites in East Jerusalem and detained
at least 5 observers.  This despite the assurance which the Legal
Advisor to the Foreign Ministry, Joel Zinger, provided to B'Tselem
that local observers were entitled to enter the post offices to
monitor the election process.
<P>
All of these problems are likely to have contributed to reduced
voter turnout in the Jerusalem district.  While turnout throughout
the West Bank and Gaza was between 70-85% of eligible voters, in
the Jerusalem district less than 35% of registered voters cast
their ballots.

<FONT SIZE=+3><B><I> Human Rights in the Palestinian Authority </I></B></FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>The Palestinian Preventive Security Service </B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>A</B></FONT> number of Palestinian security forces have been formed to operate
in the Palestinian autonomous areas.  Yet one of these forces -
the Preventive Security Service (PSS) - also operates outside of
the autonomous areas and is responsible for systematic human rights
violations.  In August, B'Tselem released a report on human rights
violations committed by the PSS in areas still under Israeli
jurisdiction.  
<P>
<B>Neither Law Nor Justice</B> documents many instances of extrajudicial
punishment, abduction, torture and prolonged, arbitrary detention
of Palestinians from the West Bank by the PSS.  The victims are
generally accused of "morals crimes" such as prostitution or
extramarital sex; drug use; theft; or collaboration with the Israeli
authorities.  In none of the cases investigated was the victim
presented with an arrest warrant, formally charged with a crime
or given the opportunity to defend him/herself.
<P>
While the PSS and the Palestinian Authority (PA) as a whole are
directly responsible for these incidents, Israel also bears
responsibility under international law for the safety and well-being
of the population under its rule.  In spite of this obligation,
the Israeli security forces have not taken any action to prevent
the continuation of these violations throughout the West Bank. 
In contrast, Israel vigorously enforces the prohibition on the
functioning of Palestinian security officials in East Jerusalem. 
This suggests that Israel is concerned exclusively with encroachment
upon its sovereignty, rather than with the well-being of the
population under its control.  Several sources point to a secret
agreement between Israel and the PA in which Israel gives the PSS
freedom of action throughout the West Bank in all criminal matters
in exchange for their cooperation against Islamic groups.  
<P>
This report is B'Tselem's first on issues related to the human
rights record of the Palestinian Authority.  As our mandate is
to monitor human rights violations by Israel, this report focused
on violations committed by the PSS in territory still under Israeli
control.  Since the report was issued, Israeli forces have withdrawn
from West Bank cities (except Hebron) and these areas have been
incorporated into the Palestinian Authority.  Most of the West
Bank still remains under Israeli control however (in what is defined
as Area C under the Oslo B Accords).  In addition, many Palestinian
villages in the West Bank are part of Area B, and as such are under
joint Israeli-Palestinian control.  The complicated division of
the West Bank into areas of Palestinian, Israeli and joint authority,
suggest that the issues raised in this report of overlapping
responsibilities for human rights remain relevant.
<P>
Since the report was issued, a Palestinian from Ramallah, 'Azzam
Muhammad Abd al-Rahim Mosleh died in Palestinian custody (September
28).  He is the fifth Palestinian to die in the custody of the
PA, apparently as a result of torture in interrogation.  Because
Mosleh was also a U.S. citizen, his death received extensive
international attention, as well as pressure by the U.S. government
to conduct a full investigation.  This pressure caused the PA to
allow the body to be exhumed for autopsy.  It is unfortunate that
only because Mosleh was a U.S. citizen did his death receive the
attention it deserved. 
<P>
<HR ALIGN=center WIDTH=60%>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+2><B>B'Tselem Fieldworker Detained by the Palestinian Authority</B></FONT>
<P>
Since B'Tselem issued its report on the Preventive Security Service
(PSS), its fieldworker Bassem 'Eid has been subjected to increasingly
serious harassment and intimidation by agents of the Palestinian
Authority. Other Palestinian human rights activists have faced similar forms of intimidation
<P>
Immediately following the release of the report in August 1995,
Colonel Jibril Rajoub, Head of the PSS in the West Bank, accused
Mr. 'Eid - one of the report's authors - of being "an agent of
the Israeli police."  In light of the hundreds of cases of
Palestinians killed by their compatriots during the intifada for
suspected collaboration with Israel, such a statement posed a direct
threat to Mr. 'Eid's safety.
<P>
Rajoub's statement was met with an international outcry: Palestinian,
Israeli and international human rights organizations protested
Rajoub's personal defamation of Mr. 'Eid as an attempt to evade
responsibility for the substantive allegations raised by the report. 
These organizations called for Chairman Arafat to personally
intervene to rescind the allegations against 'Eid.
<P>
In response to these appeals, Arafat's spokesperson responded that
the well-being and safety of Mr. 'Eid is not in jeopardy.  He did
not, however, retract the initial allegation.
<P>
On January 2 1996 at 11:00 p.m., Mr. 'Eid was approached by a
Palestinian police officer near his home in the Shuafat Refugee
Camp in East Jerusalem.  The officer asked Mr. 'Eid to accompany
him to Ramallah for questioning.  Mr. 'Eid was subsequently held
for 24 hours at the headquarters of Force 17 in Ramallah.  He was
not interrogated nor was he told the reason for his detention. 
Throughout this period, officials of the Authority denied the fact
that he was being detained and claimed that he was not being held
by any of the Palestinian security forces.
<P>
Clearly the prompt and unequivocal condemnation by local and
international human rights organizations, as well as the diplomatic
community, was instrumental in securing his safe release.
<P>
Mr. 'Eid's detention is a blatant example of an increasingly
prevalent pattern in which the Palestinian Authority attempts to
intimidate and silence its critics rather than addressing the
substance of their criticism.
On February 16 1995, longtime human rights activist and then-director of the Gaza Center
for Rights and Law, Raji Sourani, was detained for a day by Palestinian police in Gaza and
subsequently released eithout charge.
On December 7, Eyad Sarraj, the Commissioner General of the Palestinian independent Commission
for Citizens' Rights, was also detained for a day and released uncharged. PICCR is an 
independent civil rights ombudsmen office. Mr. Sarraj was detained after he criticized
the Palestinian Attorney General, Khaled al-Kidra, for not responding to his inquiries 
regarding specific cases of abuse.
<P> This pattern of detentions bodes poorly for freedom of human rights advocacy under 
Palestinian Authority.

</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>

For more than twenty years, the Israeli government has failed to
protect the lives, integrity, and property of the Palestinian
residents of Hebron from repeated attacks by settlers in the city.
<P>
The Jewish settlement inside Hebron, located in the densely populated
center of a large Palestinian city, differs from other settlements
in the Occupied Territories.  B'Tselem, as well as other human
rights organizations, have repeatedly called attention to the serious
deficiencies regarding law enforcement vis-a-vis settlers,
particularly the settlers in Hebron.  These deficiencies continue
despite repeated acknowledgments by the Israeli authorities of
their obligations to act forcefully against violence.   
<P>
The most recent acknowledgment of this obligation occurred following
the massacre of Palestinian worshippers at the Cave of the Patriarchs
in February 1994.  The governmental commission of inquiry (the
Shamgar Commission), established to investigate the circumstances
surrounding the incident, forcefully and broadly criticized the
authorities' failure to enforce the law against settlers and Israeli
citizens, and noted serious defects in law enforcement.  The Israeli
government adopted the findings of the Shamgar Commission, increased
the police presence in Hebron and opened another police station
in the city.
<P>
These measures, however, did not improve the human rights situation
in Hebron.  In September, B'Tselem released a report which
demonstrated that in spite of the Shamgar Commission's unequivocal
recommendations, security forces continue to act half-heartedly
with regard to repeated acts of violence by settlers in Hebron
against Palestinians.  In numerous cases, the police conducted
no investigation following incidents of violence and only in isolated
instances were those responsible brought to trial. 
<P>
In fact, rather than protecting the Palestinian population, the
increased presence of security forces in Hebron only increased
human rights violations and the bureaucratic harassment of the
Palestinian population.  In the 18 months following the massacre
in the Cave of the Patriarchs, 26 Palestinians were killed in Hebron
by the security forces, and many more were injured.  This compares
to eleven Palestinian fatalities in the rest of the West Bank as
a whole during the same period.
<P>
Less dramatic than the casualty figures, yet perhaps more insidious,
is the massive disruption of daily life in Hebron as a result of
settlers and soldiers.  Palestinians wishing to travel from one
end of the city to the other are confronted by a logistical
nightmare.  The main roads surrounding the city center - where
the settlers live - are guarded by thirty-two roadblocks and 10
manned checkpoints.  Curfews and closures, imposed more often in
Hebron than in any other West Bank city, impose additional hardships.
<P>
These violations of the right to life and to freedom of movement
are the direct result of the presence of Israeli settlers.  The
massive military presence is there to protect the settlers, as
are the road closures, the curfews, the roadblocks, and the
checkpoints.  This creates an absurd moral and political reality
in which a minority of 450 Jewish settlers dictates the lives of
more than 120,000 Palestinians in the city.  
<P>
From a human rights perspective, the conclusion required by the
unique situation of Hebron's Jewish settlement - located within
a large Palestinian city and creating constant friction between
Palestinians and settlers - was unavoidable: the continued presence
of Jewish settlers will inevitably result in continued violations
of the human rights of Palestinian residents.  B'Tselem therefore
called for the dismantlement of the settlement inside the city
of Hebron. 
<P>
B'Tselem issued <B>Impossible Co-existence: Human Rights in Hebron Since 
the Massacre at the Cave of the Patriarchs</B> report during the negotiations for the Oslo
2 agreement in order to call attention to the problematic nature
of any solution which leaves the Jewish settlement intact.  Media
reports during the negotiations suggested that the agreement would
leave Israeli soldiers in control of the entire city.  The agreement
eventually reached, however, stipulates a partial redeployment,
with the IDF remaining in control of the portion of the city which
contains the settlement buildings.  While this is preferable to
the initial arrangement, it offers no solution for the Palestinians
who live in the neighborhoods around the settlement buildings -
precisely the population which suffers most from the problems
described in the report.

<FONT SIZE=+3><B><I> After the Report: Communicating Human Rights Information </I></B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>

<B>by Stan Cohen</B>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>B</B></FONT>'Tselem, like all national and international human rights
organizations, "trades" in one main resource: information.  By
collecting reliable information about human rights violations and
disseminating these facts in reports, we hope to have a public
and political impact.  If people (governments, media, the ordinary
public) "only knew" - about torture, political killings, house
demolition - then they would wake up, react, do something.
<P>
Behind this strategy is a touching faith in the power of knowledge. 
The human rights movement not only upholds the ideal of universal
values and standards, but also assumes that information about their
violations will produce universal moral and emotional responses.
<P>
This is just the faith that is contradicted by the daily practise
of human rights work.  The massive amount of information we generate
is not matched by public responses appropriate to the scale of
the atrocities.  Nor are the resources we devote to collecting
this information matched by sustained thinking about how it should
be disseminated or what effect it might have on its intended
audiences.  Reports are "released" - without evaluating or even
monitoring their impact.  A sophisticated international system
of moral bookkeeping carefully collects, checks, processes and
circulates information about human rights violations all over the
world.  But we have little idea what this information does to people. 
Sitting in New York, London or Paris, what does it mean to hear
about more horrors in Rwanda, Syria or Bosnia?  What do Israelis
actually think when they read in about yet another B'Tselem
report on torture?
<P>
Many human rights organizations are not interested in such questions
because they are not explicitly trying to reach the general public. 
Their information circulates in a closed circuit made up of other
like-minded organizations, governments, United Nations-type agencies,
lawyers and academics.  Within this circuit, the information is
indeed self-evident, the facts do speak for themselves.  For
converted audiences, this confirms what they already knew.  For
target governments and their protectors this is just more information
to be ignored, denied, explained away or justified.
<P>
Much human rights information remains in this loop, endlessly
circulating in reports, self-referential official documents, fact-
finding missions, enquiries, UN committees, conferences and legal
texts.  It simply does not reach a wider public.  And when it does,
it drops into some kind of cognitive black hole.  The information
itself is not denied.  But you accommodate to knowledge of atrocities
("that's the sort of thing that happens in places like that") or
just feel helpless ("what can I do about things like that?"). 
This happens even to the dramatic stories that pass the media
threshold - Bosnia, Somalia, Rwanda, Burundi, Haiti.  The initial
attention, compassion and outrage seem to burn themselves out. 
So the information is "lost" - preserved and recycled in yet another
"Follow-up Report" which records that indeed the same old things
are still happening.
<P>
For last two years, I have been studying how human rights
organizations disseminate their information to the wider public
and how to evaluate the effect of this information.  This project
grew out of my experience in human rights work in Israel and the
Occupied Territories.
<P>
This is a rather special case for human rights reporters.  The
violations against the Palestinians during Israel's twenty-eight
year military occupation could be expected from any such regime. 
But these abuses happened (and, in the shadow of the "Peace Process,"
still happen on a more restricted scale) while Israeli society
itself remained formally democratic.  Freedom of expression, the
rule of law and academic freedom have all remained intact.
<P>
Unlike most societies where gross human rights violations are
routine, this relative openness means that knowledge of what is
happening is available and accessible.  Investigative journalism
regularly informs the public about what is happening.  And - as
the Israeli government correctly replies to its critics - human
rights organizations, Israeli, international and even Palestinian,
benefit from an access and freedom to report quite unthinkable
in repressive societies elsewhere in the Middle East.  On one subject
alone - allegations of torture and mistreatment of Palestinian
detainees - five major reports have been produced which were widely
circulated over four years.  These were all composed of detailed,
vivid and irrefutable evidence.
<P>
Israelis then cannot say in good faith that "we didn't know" nor
claim that there were restrictions on their freedom and opportunity
to protest.  Yet the level of reaction has always seemed less than
this cumulative information "should" produce.
<P>
This gap between knowledge and action - what you know and what
you do - is not, of course, unique to Israel.  Human rights
information everywhere is always selectively filtered - whether
it is easily available or whether it has to penetrate the densest
official censorship, intimidation, lies and propaganda.
<P>
My report deals mainly with the international rather than the Israeli
context.  Based on fieldwork with organizations such as Amnesty
International, I set out some issues to consider in getting our
reports "off the shelves."  As well as moving quickly onto the
next campaign, we need to pause to think about what happened to
the last one.

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>Memo From the Director</B></FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=+3><B><I> After Rabin: Incitement and Violence </I></B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>T</B></FONT>he shock and outrage over the assassination of Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin crossed national borders and was felt by Palestinians
as well as by Israelis.  Expressions of happiness by Palestinians over
Rabin's death, which would have been expected at the height of the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, were almost non-existent.  As Defense
Minister at the beginning of the intifada, Yitzhak Rabin showed little
concern for the human rights of Palestinians and advocated crushing
the uprising by force - his most infamous instruction was to "break
their bones."  While human rights violations continued under his tenure
as Prime Minister, which began in 1992, Rabin also began to champion
a political solution based on negotiation and compromise.  The fact
that he was assassinated by a Jewish extremist after he signed peace
agreements with the PLO (even though many Palestinians are dissatisfied
with those agreements) turned him in the eyes of many into a hero who
sacrificed his life for the sake of peace.
<P>
     The assassination caused much soul searching within the Israeli
public.  For many the idea that a Jew would engage in an act of terrorism
seemed surprising.  Analysis of the security failures which allowed
the assassination demonstrated that the security services presumed
that only Arabs pose security risks.
<P>
     Such a discriminatory approach to law enforcement was documented
in B'Tselem's 1994 report <B>Law Enforcement Vis a Vis Israeli Civilians
in the Occupied Territories</B>.  This report focused specifically on acts
of violence committed by settlers against Palestinians, and the lack
of an appropriate response by the authorities.  In the wake of Rabin's
assassination, the Israeli public debated the causes of the murder. 
It seems clear that one cause is the sense of impunity with which the
radical right has acted over the years.
<P>
     The government took steps to compensate for its prior leniency
toward rightwing extremists.  In the weeks following the assassination,
dozens of investigations were completed and charges brought against
settlers suspected of committing acts of violence in the territories. 
<P>
     The government also investigated a possible connection between
anti-Rabin incitement and the assassination.   A policy adopted following
the assassination allows the application of pre-existing sedition and
incitement laws to prosecute not only those who commit seditious acts,
but also those who use inciting language.  In an unprecedented move,
the Attorney General, Michael Ben-Yair, sent a letter to newspaper
editors and television station managers requesting them to refrain
from publishing interviews with inciters or using quotes of incitement. 
Such publication, Ben-Yair warned, itself constitutes a crime and would
result in prosecution.  "Freedom of speech must take second place to
the threat to public order," Ben-Yair said.  
<P>
     The line between incitement and legitimate, if controversial,
speech can be difficult to draw.  Much judicial scrutiny following
the assassination focused on slogans used by the right, such as <I>Rabin
is a traitor</I> and <I>Rabin is a murderer</I>.  Whether these statements
constitute incitement to commit violence is debatable.  Certainly in
some instances the government overreacted and unnecessarily interfered
with freedom of speech and freedom of the press.   A few weeks after
the assassination, the Ministry of Justice acknowledged that rather
than prosecuting speech, law enforcement should concentrate on
prosecuting illegal acts.
<P>
     However, if the government has been overzealous in its crackdown
on anti-Rabin statements, it remains indifferent to incitement to commit
violence against Arabs.  At many of the same demonstrations which used
slogans such as <I>Rabin is a traitor</I>, the crowd also chanted <I>Death to
Arabs</I>.  This slogan - a clear example of incitement to commit violence
against individuals because of their nationality - was also chanted
following virtually every bus bombing or other attack by Palestinian
militants.  Neither before nor since the assassination have any
investigations been conducted into incidents of anti-Arab incitement,
nor has anyone been charged with incitement for using such slogans.
<P>
     The fact that prosecutions are brought for possible incitement
against Rabin but not for clear cases of incitement against Arabs is
yet another example of the government's discriminatory enforcement
of the law.  It also suggests a lack of concern for the safety of both
Arab citizens of the State and Arab residents of the Territories.
<P>
     The Israeli military demonstrates a similar lack of concern in
its operations in the territories.  This is clearly illustrated by
a juxtaposition of two recent events which took place on the same day
in the West Bank.  In the Jenin region, IDF forces conducted a raid
on a cafe to capture a Palestinian expelled to Jericho for attacking
collaborators.  The army's action occurred at the end of November 1995,
two days after responsibility for civil affairs and public order in
that region (defined as Area B under the Oslo Accords) had been
transferred to the Palestinian Authority.  
<P>
     On the same day in Nablus, which was still under complete Israeli
control, Fatah member Ahmad Tabuk shot and killed a local resident. 
Tabuk is known to have killed two other Nablus residents and has shot
several others in the legs as punishment for suspected collaboration
with Israel or so-called morals crimes.  Repeated demands by B'Tselem
to Israel's security authorities to stop Tabuk and his men from
committing these acts proved fruitless; the IDF gave Tabuk's gang a
free hand to operate in the city.  Only after the Palestinian Authority
took control of Nablus did Tabuk turn himself in.
<P>
     In the first incident, the IDF conducted a large scale military
operation in an area where it has ceded primary responsibility.  In
the second, the IDF took no action in an area still under its total
control.  The juxtaposition of these two events strengthens the claim
that the IDF is motivated solely by national, political considerations
and wantonly neglects its obligation to protect Palestinians under
its control.
<P>
     Both the issue of incitement to violence and IDF activities in
the territories demonstrate a failure to ensure and protect basic rights
to safety and well-being.  In both these cases, the inactions as well
as the actions of the government pose problems from a human rights
perspective and require the ongoing vigilance of B'Tselem.

<FONT SIZE=+3><B><I> Oslo II: A New Human Rights Map </I></B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>T</B></FONT>he redeployment of Israeli forces in the West Bank according to the Oslo II agreement is well under
way.  All West Bank cities are now part of the Palestinian autonomous area with the exception of Hebron,
which will be handed over in March.
<P>
The implementation of autonomy will significantly reduce interaction between Palestinians and Israeli forces,
and thus lessen the potential for human rights violations.  However, the division of the West Bank into
three types of areas makes the situation more complex.  The majority of the Palestinian population live
in what is defined as Area A, which is Palestinian autonomous territory.  In Area B, populated by Palestinian
villages, the Palestinian Authority will have responsibility for civil affairs, while Israel will remain in
control of security issues.  The remaining 75% of West Bank territory is defined as Area C, in which
Israel remains in complete control.  In addition, Israel remains in control of overall security, borders,
East Jerusalem, and Jewish settlements.  
<P>
In light of this situation, the following issues relating to Israel's human rights policies and practices are
likely to require continued scrutiny:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Freedom of movement: </B></FONT><P>
While the agreements all recognize that the West Bank and Gaza are one territorial
unit, Israel imposes a great many restrictions on travel between the two territories.  The populations most
injured by travel restrictions between the West Bank and Gaza are Gaza students enrolled in West Bank
universities; people needing to travel to receive medical care; and families where the spouses are not legal
residents of the same area.  Furthermore, Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza are denied access
to the many medical, educational and cultural institutions in East Jerusalem.  Israel also remains in control
of exit from the territories, and can therefore deny Palestinians the right to travel abroad.  
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Torture:</B></FONT><P>
 The General Security Service and other bodies which conduct interrogations of Palestinian suspects
are likely to continue to employ methods which constitute ill-treatment and torture (see articles in this
issue).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Settler violence:</B></FONT><P>
  Palestinian police are forbidden under the Accords from arresting or prosecuting Israeli
citizens.  B'Tselem has documented both the violent acts of settlers and the lax law enforcement by Israeli
authorities.  It is unclear how the militant settlers will respond to Palestinian autonomy.  
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Human Rights in East Jerusalem:</B></FONT><P>
 The 160,000 Palestinian residents of East Jerusalem remain under
direct Israeli control.  Unlike Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza, East Jerusalem Palestinians are
considered residents of the State of Israel and are therefore subject to Israeli law, rather than the laws
and military orders which apply in the territories.  While this affords them greater protection for basic
rights, they are still subject to a variety of violations.  The most pressing of these are denial of family
reunification and discriminatory policies regarding land use and housing (see article in this issue).
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>Land:</B></FONT><P>
 Throughout the occupation, Israel has confiscated privately-owned land for the construction of
settlements.  Since the signing of the Oslo II Accords, much additional land was confiscated for the construction
of by-pass roads to enable settlers to travel in the West Bank while avoiding Palestinian population centers. 
<P>
Just Compensation for past confiscations as well as the issue of future confiscations
will require scrutiny.

<HR>
<I>       Testimony of Musa Farid Musa Masharka, 26 years old, resident of
Jafna, Ramallah District.  He was detained on March 7, 1995 and
<B>interrogated for 64 days</B>.  On May 16, he was released with no charges
filed against him.</I>
<HR>
<P>
... On about the seventh day they also started to shake me - Mufaz
was first.  I would be sitting on the low chair, and he would grab
me by the shirt and shake me 15-20 times.  Twice, three times and
sometimes more during every interrogation session.
<P>
Adnan also started to shake me that same day.  Sometimes while
he stood and I sat and sometimes while we both stood.  My back
started to hurt.
<P>
Every 48 hours they let me sleep an hour or two.  Aside from that
only on the weekends.  On Fridays I could shower, but not change
clothes.
<P>
On the eighth day (March 15) Captain Dori came in and received
my file.  He is also very strong.  He lifts weights.  He made me
crouch on my toes.  Every day there were 6-8 hours of interrogation,
sometimes I ate in the interrogation room.  They let me go to the
bathroom about an hour after I started asking.  In shabeh (abusive
body positioning where the detainee is tied in an uncomfortable
position awaiting the next interrogation) they let me whenever
I needed to.  Until the eighth day, my jacket, my shirt and my
undershirt were completely torn.  When they made me kneel on my
toes, I would kneel two, three minutes and then collapse and say
that I couldn't get up, I didn't care if they killed me.  They
pulled me up by my clothes or by the handcuffs.  My hands were
torn from this.  They would hit and kick me when I got up.
<P>
... On the 34th day, April 10, 1995, "Emilio" came, who identified
himself as a Colonel, "Abu Amin," Ghali, and Dori and another from
Ramallah.  The five of them interrogated me ... They began to
interrogate me for 20 hours a day.  9 hours of interrogation, shabeh
for an hour, another 8 or 9 hours - and so on.
<P>
There were more beatings and shakings, they pressed forcefully
on my forehead from both sides.  A lot of violence.
<P>
I would throw up a lot.  The intensive interrogation continued
three days - Sunday, Monday and Tuesday.  When I threw up they
stopped for a bit and then started again.  They didn't call anyone. 
Only on the last night did they bring a medic to the interrogation
room.  A policeman.  He gave me aspirin and told me to drink -
that's what they always say.

<FONT SIZE=+3><B><I> Attorney General, Michael Ben-Yair criticizes the GSS and shaking </I></B></FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=+1><B>from an interview given to HaLishka, quoted in Ha'aretz 19.10.95</B></FONT>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+2><B>"F</B></FONT>ollowing the death of Harizat in interrogation we saw how shaking
was done and we decided that this could not be a routine method
of interrogation.  This is not the "defense of necessity" (an
emergency situation which allows the use of violence outlawed by
the penal code).  ... We did not know what shaking consisted of. 
We thought that shaking is a light jostling intended to ensure
attention.  The damage liable to be caused by shaking is not just
death.  It is liable to cause brain damage as well.  I am not willing
for every young Palestinian with a black beard who is detained
to suffer brain damage.  But if he has information which is likely
to prevent a much greater evil and the interrogator uses this method
in order to discover this information, I will not charge him with
a criminal offense... 
<P>
We have to walk a very fine line.  I recognize the need to provide
the GSS with tools, but we live in a law-abiding, democratic country. 
In this country the law applies to all authorities of the state
including this interrogation authority, i.e. the GSS and those
in charge of it, i.e. the Prime Minister.  Interrogations can be
conducted only according to law, not outside of the law and not
above the law.  The way in which the legal system functioned in
the disagreement over GSS interrogations, and the way we articulated
things, provided the interrogator with the defense of the law when
he employed certain methods, including shaking, in order to prevent
a more serious injury, if there was no other way to prevent it.
... of course the Knesset could pass a law - although I don't know
how legal it would be - so that certain laws do not apply to the
security forces.  But so long as the Knesset does not do so, the
laws of Israel apply to all interrogation authorities.  ... 
<P>
It is impossible to provide [the GSS] with other methods that are
illegal.  There's no such thing.  We're not opening up torture
chambers instead of intelligence.  What do we need interrogators
for?  An interrogator works with intelligence and with sense..."

<I>
<FONT SIZE="+3"><B> More About B'Tselem </B></FONT>
</I>
</CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
     <B> B'Tselem </B> was founded in 1989 by a group of Knesset
members, public figures, lawyers, academics, and journalists
with the following goals:
<UL>
<LI> To provide information to the Israeli public and the
international community about violations of human rights in
the Occupied Territories.
<P>
<LI> To recommend and encourage policy changes to ensure greater
protection of human rights.
</UL>
     Since its founding, <B>B'Tselem</B> has
earned international recognition as the leading Israeli
organization monitoring, documenting and advocating to improve
the human rights situation in the Occupied Territories.  It
has issued over 50 publications which have generated extensive
media coverage both in Israel and internationally.
<P>
     <B>B'Tselem</B> serves as a leading source of information about
human rights in the territories.  Quantitative and qualitative
data is compiled from <B>B'Tselem's</B> fieldwork, government sources
and the Israeli, Palestinian and international press.  Regular
data summaries are distributed to the media and other
interested parties.  In addition, <B>B'Tselem</B> responds to queries
from Knesset members, government committees, researchers,
students and the media.  It also provides human rights
briefings to visiting foreign delegations and members of the
diplomatic community.
<P>
     <B>B'Tselem</B> faces new challenges in advocating for human
rights in light of the Oslo process and the transfer of
partial self-governance to the Palestinian Authority.  In this
process, human rights issues and obligations have frequently
been dismissed, marginalized and ignored.  
<P>
     The Oslo process has resulted in human rights
improvements in several spheres, including fewer clashes
between Palestinians and security forces and therefore fewer
casualties.  Human rights violations by Israel continue,
however, particularly in the areas of torture and ill-
treatment in interrogations; freedom of movement;
administrative detentions; lax law enforcement regarding
settler violence; discriminatory policies in East Jerusalem;
and ongoing settlement activity and land expropriation.
<P>
     Repeated acts of violence by Islamist militants opposed
to the peace process have increased the pressure on the
government to use a strong hand to quell terrorism.  The
result is a resort to such forms of collective punishment as
extended closures, as well as greater tolerance for torture of
suspected extremists. While Israel has a
right, and even an obligation, to take measures to protect its
citizens from violence, it must do so in a manner consistent
with its obligations as a state bound by the rule of law.
<P>
     In addition to continuing abuses by Israeli authorities,
the partial transfer of authority makes Palestinians subject
to human rights violations by their own governing authority as
well.  As an Israeli organization, <B>B'Tselem</B> focuses primarily
on the Israeli authorities and their legal responsibilities to
protect and ensure human rights in the Occupied Territories. 
However, <B>B'Tselem</B> also monitors human rights violations by the
Palestinian Authority.

	As people demand increasingly various services from forests

 forests are expected to



be the place for stroll

 recreational use

 learning of the nature

 and conservation of environment and bio-diversity for the future.



	The area of forests in Japan is about 25 million ha

 which is 68 % of the total land area.



About 40 percent of the forests

 about ten million ha

 consists of man-made forests

 and the



rest consists of natural forests. The man-made forests have been established mostly with



coniferous species after the World War II

 and 80 percent of them has become around 35



years old

 which need to be thinned. The proper management of these young forests including



thinning is one of the major tasks of present forestry in Japan.



<br>	The estimated wood stock of Japan is about 3.1 thousand million cubic meters

 and its



annual increment is about 7 hundred million cubic meters now. The demand for wood in



Japan is

 however

 around one hundred million cubic meters

 and does not increase recently



because of the substitute materials. Meanwhile

 70 % of the total wood consumption in



Japan comprizes imported wood

 and the portion of the processed wood products in the



imported wood is increasing. This trend is leading to a decline of wood industry. Also the



majority of the workers engaged in forest industry communities in Japan are aged

 and



Japanese forestry and forest industry have been declined. Under such circumstances





activating the forestry through solving these problems is an important task subjected to Forestry



Agency of Japan.



<br>	On the other hand

 changes of global environment as global warming

 forest decline by



acid deposition

 decrease of tropical forests

 desertification and so on have become a world-



wide issue recently

 which is connected directly or indirectly with the survival of mankind.



Thus

 the functions of forest and the roles of forestry in conserving global environment is



becoming international concern. Japan

 as the nation that has the duty to contribute to the



countries world-wide

 is expected to promote the international cooperation and foreign aid



toward the developing area of the world.



<br>	Two basic tasks are there in Japanese forestry

 sustainable forest management for



hamonizing functions of wood production and environmental conservation

 and activation



of forestry and forest industry to develop domestic wood utilization. And in research

 the



technical cooperation of global environment conservation may be added to the two. There



are seven major assignments of research and development for the Institute

 according to Agriculture

 Forestry and Fisheries Research Council.

<br>    The first viewpoint is to seek ways of reinforcing overall industrial structures of agriculture

 forestry and fisheries in the efforts of raising productivity

 improving products quality

 improving labor environment and establishing advanced technologies

 under the evolving situations in international communities in the years of post Urguay round agreement

 which is consistent with environmental conservation.

<br>    The second viewpoint is to seep ways of creating new industries

 which are beyond the frame of traditional agriculture

 forestry and fisheries by nature

 by means of promoting fundamental research in biotechnologies.

<br>    The third viewpoint is to seek ways of attaining efficient processing and distribution systems of products in agriculture

 forestry and fisheries by means of realizing a good supply of products which are free from damages of agricultural chemicals.

<br>    The fourth viewpoint is to seek ways of vitalizing rural communities

 improving living enviroment and enhancing multi-functions which are endowed in agricultural

 mountain and fishing villages under the evolving fear of extensive use of farmland

 extensive management of forest land and declining vital power of economic activities in rural communities.

<br>    The fifth viewpoint is to seek ways of promoting environmental conservation and  appropriate resource management which aims at achieving sustainable development of human society in harmony with global environment.

<br>    The sixth view point is to seek ways of contributing sustainable development of world agriculture

 forestry and fisheries.

<br>    The seventh viewpoint is to seek ways of promoting fundamental research which is the basis for attaining more efficient technological development in agriculture

 forestry and fisheries.





<br>

	To meet with the changing demands

 Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute was



reorganized in 1988. This booklet is introducing the state of our 



researches at Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute in brief.

<A NAME="no.1"><h3>1. FOREST ENVIRONMENT IN JAPAN</h3></A>



<p>



<h4>Climate</h4>



<p>	Since the zone fro



m 20 to 46 of north latitude

 wherein the main Japanese islands lie





has variable climatic conditions

 horizontal climates ranging from subtropical to boreal are



observable in Japan. Also

 since the islands lie from the northeast to the southwest along the



Asian continent's east coast

 northwest monsoon blows in from the continent in winter and



southeast monsoon blows in from the Pacific Ocean in summer. The winter monsoon is



blocked by high mountains and gives abundant snowfall in the regions facing the Sea of



Japan

 whereas dry and clear weather continues in the regions facing the Pacific Ocean.



Although fine weather dominates due to the Ogasawara high pressure in summer

 the Baiu



and Shurin fronts give much rainfall before and after summer season.



<br>	In addition

 many typhoons generated over the south Pacific strike Japan every year.



These climatic conditions bring much rain and snow to Japan making it one of the most rainy



and humid countries in the world.



<p>



<h4>Topography and Geology</h4>



<p>



	The Japanese islands

 lying adjacent to the Asian continent's east coast

 have been



receiving frequent crustal movements since the Paleozoic era and have had volcanic activity



since the Cenozoic era. Thus the topography is of a great variety. Mountainous

 volcanic





and hilly areas occupy about 75 % of the entire land area. Mountainous areas are dissected



finely by rivers of all sizes

 and mountain slopes generally are very steep. There are about



two-hundred volcanoes of large and small sizes

 with the most famous one being Mt. Fuji.



Several of them are still active. New and old ejecta from these volcanoes widely covers the



land. Although not large in scale

 some glacial sediments are observable at higher altitudes





and not a little residue from periglacial phenomenon exists. Terraces formed by transgression



and regression are scattered in low-altitude areas.



<br>	Because of the scarcity of plains suitable for farming

 Japan's forestry is concentrated



in mountainous regions with steep terrain.



<br>	The Japanese islands can be divided structurally into two parts

 northeast Japan and



southwest Japan

 by a fracture belt called the Fossa Magna that extends across the center of



Honshu Island from the north to the south. In northeastern Japan

 strata of the Cenozoic era



and volcanic rocks are distributed widely

 and only in a few areas are rocks of the Paleozoic



and Mesozoic eras found. On the other hand

 in southwestern Japan

 there are strata of the



Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras with very little of the Cenozoic era. Southwestern Japan is



divided further into two zones

 the inner (Japan Sea coast zone) and the outer (Pacific Ocean



side) by the Median Tectonic Line. In the outer Zone

 the Paleozoic and Mesozoic strata and



metamorphic rocks parallel the Median Tectonic Line. This is reflected in the mountain range.



Acidic rocks are distributed in the inner zone.



<p>



<h4>Forest Soils</h4>



<p>	Since the weather is variable

 and the geology and the topography is complicated

 a



variety of forest soils are found in Japan. The most widespread forest soil in Japan is Brown



forest soil covering about one half of the entire forest land. Other important forest soils of



Japan are Black soils

 Podozolic soils in the cooler areas

 and the Red and Yellow soil



occurring in central Honshu

 Kyushu

 and the southwestern islands. Gley soils

 Peaty soils





Dark red soils and Immature soils are also found in relatively small areas.



<br>	Brown forest soils are the most common soils which are distributed in the temperate



to warm-temperate zones of Japan

 but their properties vary widely depending upon region





altitude

 and parent material. Usually

 Brown forest soils have the horizon sequence of (Ao)-



A-B-C

  and no eluvi-illuviation. The Brown forest soils are characterized by brown colored



B horizons and slightly to moderately strong acidities. The Brown forest soils are divided



further into sub-types based on soil moisture condition in the Japanese Forest Soil Classification

 which was developed as a basis for the reforestation by "Right Site

 Right Species". Out



of the sub-types

 Moderately moist Brown forest soils being distributed most widely

 have



been demonstrated to be suitable for reforestation with Sugi (<i>Cryptomeria japonica</i>) and



hinoki (<i>Chamaecyparis obtusa</i>). 



<br>	Black soils

 which have been called "Kuroboku" traditionally

 have thick black colored



A horizons rich in humus. Most of the Black soils are derived from volcanic ash

 and



distributed widely on gentle slopes of volcano skirts in the Hokkaido

 Tohoku

 Kanto and



Kyushu districts

 but they are scarce in Kinki

 Chugoku

 and Shikoku.



<br>	Podozolic soils occur from upper temperate to alpine zones. The soils are divided into



the Dry and Wet types. Establishment of man-made forest in the Dry podozolic soil area is



comparatively difficult because of their strong acidity and poor nutrient status. In the Wet



Podozolic soil areas

 natural old-growth forests of Hinoki do exist

 and when the forests are



cut

 regeneration becomes extremely difficult.



<br>	Red and Yellow soils occur principally in the tropical and sub-tropical zones

 but some



of them are found in the warm-temperate zones of Japan. The Red and Yellow soils of



temperate Japan were not formed under the current climate

 but they are the so-called "relic



soils"

 which were originally formed under the warmer climate of the Pleistocene interglacial



epoch

 and remained in the area of relatively stable topography. However

 the Yellow soils



found commonly in the Ryukyu Islands were suggested to have been formed in a recent



epoch. These Red and Yellow soils are generally infertile irrespective of the genesis

 and



support Akamatsu (<i>Pinus densiflora</i>) forests in many cases in the mainland Japan.



<p>



<h4>General Fearture of Natural and Manmade Forests</h4>



<p>	Japanese archiperago lies between 20 and 46 of north latitude and shows a very wide range of climatic conditions

 especially in temperature and snow fall. Though annual precipitation ranges from about 800 mm to more than 3,000 mm

 it is high enough to sustain forests. The following four principal vegetation zones are recognized. 



<br>    Sub-alpine evergreen conifer (boreal) forest:Conifer forests consisting of <i>Abies veitchii</i>

 <i>Tsuga diversifolia</i>

 <i>Picea jezoensis var. hondoensis</i> are found at high elevations of middle to northern Honshu. <i>Abies sachalinensis</i> and <i>Picea jezoensis</i> are dominant in Hokkaido. A decidious conifers

 <i>Larix kaempferi</i> and <i>Abies sachalinensis</i> are the main species of the plantation forest.



<br>    Cool-temperate braod-leaved deciduous (summer-green) forest:</i>Fagus crenata</i> and <i>Querucus cripsula</i> from the main portion of the natural forests in the northeast Honshu. <i>Fagus crenata</i> is diminant especially in the snowy region of the Japan Sea side. Such conifers as <i>Tsuga sieboldii</i>

 <i>Abies firma</i> and <i>A. homolepis</i> are rather dominant in the Pacific side. <i>Cryptomeria japonica</i>

 that grows originally as an edaphic climax of this zone

 is widely planted.



<br>    Warm-Temperate and Sub-tropical broad-leaved evergreen (laurel) fbrorest:The laurel forests

 consisting <i>Presea thumbergii

 Castanopsis cuspidata

 Querucus acuta</i> and other evergreen broad-leaved trees

 are the principal vegetation of Kyushu

 Shikoku and southwestern Honshu. 



<br>    The plantaion forests of <i>Cryptomeria japonica</i> and <i>Chamaecyparis obtusa</i>

 and secondary forest of <i>Pinus densiflora</i> cover more than one half of forested area.

<h4>2.3.2. Forest Biology Division</h4>



<p>



	In a forest ecosystem

 many organisms such as mammals

 birds

 insects

 nematodes and microorganisms co-exist and exhibit their own biological functions. Research activities of the division cover a wide range of both basic and applied topics on these organisms.

<br>	Taxonomical,

 ecological and physiological studies are conducted comprehensively on these organisms to analyze their roles in the ecosystem and their natural relationships.

<br>	Pest management and wildlife management are studied to conserve forest resources and characteristics of certain organisms are also studied for the further use of forest resources.

<h4>2.4. Regional Forest Research Centers</h4>



<p>



	Since Japanese archipelago stretches long from the north to the south

 and is different in climate

 vegetation

 topography

 soil

 land-use history and socio-economic status from region to region

 forestry issues also vary from place to place. Five Forest Research Centers have responsibilities of carrying out researches to tackle on the regional forestry issues

 respectively. The main research assignments to be performed by the respective research centers; sutsainable management of cool-temperate and boreal forests in Hokkaido

 management of snowy area forests and beech forests in Tohoku

 management of sub-alpine and urban forests in Kanto-Chubu

 landscape-ecological and architectural forest management and forests on poor soils in Kansai-Chugoku

 management of man-made forests on steep topography in Shikoku

 and management of warm-temperate forests in Kyushu. Furthermore

 the Centers contribute and often lead national-level research programs.



<p>

<h4>2.4.1. Hokkaido Research Center</h4>



<p>



	In Hokkaido

 there are three main of forest cool-temperate broadleaved

 boreal coniferous and mixed forests

 consisting of the same tree species of the former two types. These forest types and their species composition are different from those of the other areas of Japan. Toward sustainable management of these forests

 the Hokkaido Research Center is conducting various surveys and studies. They investigate the characteristics and functions of these forests

 improve quality and quantity of the foersts based on the results obtained from other studies

 improve forest protection and management systems for sustainable yield

 and meet the demand of global environmental problems.

<h4>2.4.2. Tohoku Research Center</h4>



<p>



	The Tohoku district is in the northern part of Honshu (Mainland) and consists of six prefectures. The total area is 6,689,000ha and the forest land is 4,704,000ha. The forest land belongs to the private(48 %)

 the local government(8 %) and the national government(44 %).  There are high mountains running from the north to the south in the central portion. These mountains separate the climatical condition into 2 types. One is the Japan Sea type with much snow and rainfall and the other is the Pacific Ocean type with less snow and rainfall.

<br>	Tohoku Research Center does research on silviculture

 forest management

 forest protection and forest influences under snowy and cold condition through 3 research divisions (10 laboratories)

 1 research coordination office and 1 general affairs sections.



<p>

<img src="fig-21.GIF">

<p>

<h4>2.4.3. Kansai Research Center</h4>



<p>



	As Kansai Area had been  most advanced in forest resource development in the nation

 the area is mostly covered by secondary vegetation and plantations. One of the main subjects is to elucidate the mechanism and establish conservation techniques of such forest functions as timber production

 soil and water conservation

 amenity in ralation to forest dynamics. Another subject is to develop various techniques of forestry and pest controls in order to establish sustainable timber management systems. The third subject is to develop a methodology to integrate these outcomes in order to establish a regional system to utilize multiple forest resources.



<p>

<img src="fig-22.GIF">

<p>

<h4>2.4.4. Shikoku Research Center</h4>



<p>



	The Forest on Shikoku island covers 74 % of the island.  Most of it is man-made forest.  People have attached greater importance to forestry as one of the basic industries.  Development of healthy forests is highly expected as an object of forest management. In climate setting

 Shikoku island shows a contrast in precipitation between the inland sea side (slight rain) and  the other Pacific Ocean side (heavy rain).  Fragile geological structure and recent water shortage heighten the interest and expectation to the conservational function of forests.  We are working cooperatively on the subject for developing advanced technology for better forest management.



<p>

<img src="fig-23.GIF">

<p>

<h4>2.4.5. Kyushu Research Center</h4>



<p>



	Kyushu is covered with warm temperate and subtropical forests including two major types: evergreen broad-leaved forests and coniferous plantations of Sugi

 (<i>Cryptomeria japonica</i>)

 and Hinoki

 (<i>Chamaecyparis obtusa</i>).

<br>	Research is aimed at developing sustainable forest management systems

 which are based on environmental

 ecological and socio-economical characteristics of the region. Longterm study sites have been established to monitor the dynamics of forest ecosystems. Studies on interactions among forest organisms are applied to both conservation of biological diversity and pest management. Molecular biological technologies are developed to analyze phylogenetic relationships and identify species. Various kinds of information are integrated using advanced computer technologies including GIS.

<h4>4.1. Properties of site environment and forest communities</h4> 



<p>



	Forest ecosystem has various functions and demands of people enhancing and



utilizing them have been increasing. To establish sustainable forest management

 in which



various functions of forest ecosystem are harmonized

 obtaining fundamental knowledge on



the forest ecosystem is essential. In the research subject on site environment

 studies are



undertaken on genesis and properties of forest soils

 water dynamics and thermo-flux in



forest soils

 and geomorphological and geological properties of subsoils on hill slopes

 etc. 



for evaluating soil and water resources. The human impacts such as acid deposition and



undesirable forest management on site environment is also analyzed

 and methods for



forecasting the change of site environment  is developed. In the studies on forest communities

 properties of species in the communities are analyzed in terms of the adaptation to the



environment

 breeding properties

 and life history. Then distribution properties of the



composed species

 the relationship between stand structure and natural disturbance





nutrient dynamics

 etc. are analyzed. Effects of climate change on growing processes of trees



is analyzed and it is forecasted how trees are adapted to the change.

<h4>4.9. Establishing techniques for managing cool-temperate and boreal forests



by the effective use of their own natural processes and patterns</h4>







	In Hokkaido

 there are three main forest types of cool-temperate broadleaved

 boreal



coniferous and mixed forests. The last type consists of the same tree species of the former



two types.  These forest types and species composition are different from those of the other



areas of Japan.



<br>	Selective cutting and natural regeneration are practiced principally in natural forests of



Hokkaido. On the other hand

 artificial forests have actively been established since the latter



half of 1950's.  At present

 the area of artificial forests is approximately 1.5 million hectares. 



Thinning is being practiced in their young-and middle-aged stands.  However

 there occur



various problems in the thinning practice.  In addition

 other problems are appearing in the



establishment processes of the even-aged pure stands.  Developments of techniques to



overcome these problems are insufficient because of our little experience in artificial forest



management. This situation renews understanding of the management based on the natural



processes and patterns

 and demands improvement and development of techniques



concerned.



<br>	To solve these problems and to contribute to sustainable management of cooltemperate and boreal forests

 the Hokkaido Research Center will carry out the following



studies.  The Center will clarify characteristics of the forests from various aspects such as



species characteristics

 biodiversity

 forest dynamics

 and so on

 and aim at improvement



and development of management techniques of natural forests based on the obtained results



from the former clarification.



<br>	The Center will also improve and develop new techniques of artificial forest management along natural processes and patterns.  Besides

 the Center will make efforts to improve



and to develop techniques for the avoidance of damages caused by various organisms both



in natural and artificial forests.  To improve life-quality of residents in the community and to



meet their diverse demands on forests

 the Center will clarify functions of forests for



environmental conservation

 and improve and develop techniques to keep and to increase



these functions.  By integrating the above-mentioned studies

 the Center will improve and



develop the methods of forest planning

 forest management and effective utilization of



forests in northern areas.

 and providing places for health care and recreation as well as education for



the people.



<br>	New techniques should be developed to maintain forests health and to promote



forestry. For enhancing forest management technology

 our research priority have been placed



on the following subjects.



<p>



<h4><i>4.13.1. Improvement of forest management technology with respect to environmental conservation</i></h4>



<blockquote>







(1) Development of forest site conservation technology at steep slope mountain area.



<br>(2) Improvement of forest conservation techniques in relation to environmental



resources.



</blockquote>







<h4><i>4.13.2. Improvement of forest management technology in areas with a high plantation ratio</i></h4>

<blockquote>







(1)Improvement of forest management techniques in mountainous area.



<br>(2)Development of management techniques for forest animals and microorganisms in



mountainous area.



</blockquote>







<h4>4.14. Improvement of management systems in warm temperate and subtropical forests</h4>







	The Kyushu area is covered with warm temperate forests and subtropical forests



including two major forest types: evergreen broad-leaved forests and coniferous plantations



of Sugi and Hinoki.  The expansion of coniferous plantation has reduced the biomass of



broad-leaved evergreen forests and the forest function of environmental conservation.  The



public needs for the forest conservation and management systems are increasing.  To meet



with the public needs for well coordinated use of both forest environment and timber





Kyushu Research Center is carrying out three main subjects including many research fields:



silviculture

 forest soil

 water and land conservation

 insects

 disease

 animals

 mushrooms





resources planning and multiple farming.



<p>



<h4><i>4.14.1. Studies of ecosystems and improvement of conservation systems in warm temperate and



subtropical forests</i></h4>



<blockquote>







(1) Regeneration mechanism of evergreen broad-leaved forests.



<br>(2) Effects of environmental changes on forest ecosystem and estimation of their 



influences.



</blockquote>







<h4><i>4.14.2. Improvement of management and utilization methods of forest biology in warm temperate



rain forests</i></h4>



<blockquote>







(1)Infestation mechanism and control of forest diseases.



<br>(2)Ecological studies and control of forest pest insects and animals.



<br>(3)Production techniques of forest by-products such as mushrooms.



</blockquote>







<h4><i>4.14.3. Improvement of watershed conservation and forest management systems in warm temperate



rain forests</i></h4>



<blockquote>







(1)Forest management and planning techniques.



<br>(2)Watershed management on soil and water conservation.



<br>(3)Regional forestry systems based on multiple farming.



</blockquote>







<h4>4.15. Studies on forest characteristics

 technologies for environment conservation and sustainable use of overseas forests</h4>







	Environmental impacts at a global scale such as warming

 desertification or acid



deposition which have been brought by human activities in a recent short period are closely



related to decrease or degradation of forests. In order to succeed forest resources as a



heritage to our offsprings

 active improvement of research and technology development for



conservation and sustainable use of forest resources in the world is needed under cooperation between developed and developing countries. Studies to be carried out are those on



characteristics of forest ecosystems

 functions of forests

 biodiversities

 monitoring and



forecasting technologies of forest resources

 and forest management for their conservation



and sustainable use.



<p>



<h4><i>4.15.1. Identification of forest ecosystem characteristics and development of technologies for



environmental conservation</i></h4>



<blockquote>







(1) Interaction between forest ecosystem and environment. 



<br>(2) Conservation technologies of forest fauna and flora.



<br>(3) Forestation technologies to improve environment-conserving function of forests.



</blockquote>







<h4><i>4.15.2. Development of technologies for forecasting of forest dynamics and for sustainable use of



forest resources</i></h4>



<blockquote>







(1) Analyses of research information on forest resources movements and environmental



changes

 and their forecasting technologies.



<br>(2) Environmentally favorable usage of forest products.



<br>(3) Forest management for resource and environmental conservation.

	Research cooperation with overseas research organizations is based on the bilateral



agreement

 such as with Australia

 Canada

 the U.S.A.

 People's Republic of China

 Republic



of Korea

 Thailand

 Malaysia etc. 



<br>



	Especially

 FFPRI and Forestry Agency of Japan have held Panel of Forestry with the



Forest Service and Department of the Interior of the United States of America periodically



since 1967 for exchanging research information within the framework of UJNR (U.S.-Japan



Cooperating Program in Natural Resources Development) which was established to facilitate



better development and conservation of natural resources for our next generation.



<br>	International assistance and cooperation by the Japanese government toward developing



countries in forestry is conducted mainly by the Japan International Cooperation Agency



(JICA). It functions in three ways

 (1) sending experts (2) providing machinery and materials





and (3) technical training. There are two types of technical cooperation projects in which



experts are dispatched as a team; one is a research type project

 and the other is an



implementation project.



<br>	The number of forestry research experts

 including the both types and survey team



members

 who have been sent from 1952 through 1995 totalled xxxx. The number of forestry



trainees who came to Japan from 1964 through 1995 totalled 3,700 from about 70 countries.



As of 1995

 technical cooperation is being conducted on 33 projects in 18 countries in the



fields of reforestation

 soil conservation

 watershed management

 silvicultural research





forest surveying

 timber utilization

 and wood processing. In addition

 some development



survey is being conducted as technical cooperation on the government basis.



<br>	Besides the JICA bilateral projects

 FFPRI participates in the international research



cooperation projects through the Science & Technology Agency and Environment Agency of 



Japan.



<br>	FFPRI is as well making contribution to CIFOR (Center for International Forestry



Research) established in 1993 under CGIAR (Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research)

 which intends to expand its responsibilities to enhance forestry research

 and



as well as to IUFRO (International Union of Forestry Research Organization)

 including its



SPDC (Special Program for Developing Countries) and APAFRI/FORSPA (Asia Pacific



Association of Forestry Research Institutions/Forestry Research Support Program for the



Asia Pacific Region) established respectively in 1990 and 1995.

<B><h2>1 TOWARD THE EPOCH OF FOREST AND TREES</B></h2>
<P>
-Retrospect of 30 years of forest/forestry and wood industries, and prospects-
<P>
(Prologue) 
<P>
1 As this report marks the 30th anniversary since it was first submitted under the 
Forestry Basic Law, it features "Toward the Epoch of Forest and Trees" and intends 
to look back and forward on foresVforestry and wood industries in Japan. 
<P>
2 Stagnation of upstream villages and forestry that nurtured forest has continued in 
the process of high economic growih and enlarged scale of economy in Japan. This 
trend has not stopped under the current longest POSt-war recession since the 
ruptured "bubble economy". Furthermore, the recent disasters caused to forests by 
typhoons, the cold weather damage in 1993, and the rice crop failure caused by 
prolonged rain seriously affected the villages in upstream areas. It is being feared 
under the circumstances that it will become difficult to maintain the functions of forest 
to supply wood and protect beautiful land and provide for bountiful water. 
<P>
3 Even under those constraints, however, forest in Japan which was devastated 
during and after the war has been improved and maintained nearly at the level of 
70% of the land. Presently, 80% of the planted forest is still in the stage of tending 
and thinning but is maturing toward the 21st century as valuable renewable 
resources of resource-scarce Japan. 
<P>
4 Strengthening of forestry and wood industries is required as the impact of the 
international market further increases along with the implementation of the 
agreements of the Uruguay Round in GATT on the other hand, the world is aware 
that establishing a sustainable economic development symbiotic with the global 
environment and nature's regenerative capacity is becoming an urgent matter. The 
concept of "forest conse~ation and sustainable management" for all the world's 
forests that was agreed upon at the United Nations Conference on Environment and 
Development (Earth Summit) is a noteworthy strategy for mankind in the area of 
foresVf orestry. 
<P>
5 Japan is now at the crossroads as to whether it can resuscitate foresVforestry toward 
the 21st century. It is expected that the leading countries of the world in the 21st 
century will be the ones which conserve good environment and rich forest, develop 
economies while maintaining primary industries such as forestry, and establish an 
industrystructure and life style that harmonize with the global environment. It is for 
this reason that Japan should aim at the epoch of forest and trees. Under the 
circumstance in which there has been growing awareness and interest in "green 
and waterf', what is important in envisioning the future is to look back on the efforts in 
the past years for building up "green and water" and secure stronger supportfrom 
the general public for its maintenance and improvement. 
<P>
<h3><B>1 Changes in forest/forestry and wood industries over the past 30 years</h3></B> 

(Background of the enactment of Forestry Basic Law and its policy thrusts) 
By the mid 50's, the post-war reconstruction in Japan was completed and the 
conditions for high economic growih were laid down. From the need for the forestry 
sector to strategically respond to the progress of economic growth, Forestry Basic Law 
was enacted in 1 964. Following is the environment surrounding the foresVforestry and 
wood industries at that time. 
<P>
+ Wood demand in Japan increased sharply with a structural change involving 
growing demand for industrial timber and declining demand for fuel wood. 
<br>
+ Due to the excessive cutting during and after the War, the forests had been 
devastated. Wood supply could not meet the surging demand and led to eventual 
increase in wood imports. It was, therefore, necessary to augment the supply 
POWer of domestic forest resources over the long term. 
<br>
+ The work force was drained from upstream villages and shrinkage of forestry labor 
became conspicuous. 
<br>
+ Income differences between the forestry sector and the secondary/tertiary sectors 
widened. 
<P>
Forestry Basic Law that was enacted taking into consideration the above situations 
upheld as goals of forestry policy stable development of forestry and improvement of 
forestry workers' economic and social status corresponding to the national economic 
growth and improvement of life standard. The signposts of the goals were 
enlargement of total forestry production coupled with improvement of forestry 
productivity, and increase of forestry workers' income. 
<P>
<B><h3>(1)Achievements during the 30 years</B></h3> 

Imrovement and enrichment of forest resources 
<P>
+ Rich forest has been nurtured while ensuring high economic development under 
the constraint of high density and a large population. 
<br>
i) World forest area 
<br>
. Decrease by 0.1% during the 10 years after 1966. 
<br>
. Decrease by 3.4% (equivalent to about 5.6 times of Japan's forest) during the 
15 years atter 1975. 
<p>
<img src="fig-3.gif">
<p>
ii) Japan's forest area
<br> 
. Maintained 25 million ha (67% of total land) for the past 30 years. 
<br>
. Among the OECD member countries, only Japan, Sweden, and Finland have 
per capita GDP of US$10,000 or more, and percentage of forest 60% or more. 
<br>
. There are 6 countries including Japan with GDP of US$ 1 trillion. The 
countries other than Japan have percentage of forest about 30% or less. 
Japan is the only country with population density 300/km2 or more. 
<br>
+ The epoch of domestic wood can be envisioned toward the 21st century if the 
forest resources in Japan are given proper treatment. 
<br>
. The forest growing stock has enlarged by 1.7 times during the past 30 years. 
<br>
. The forest resources are in a maturing stage, especially for the 1O million ha of 
Planted forest, with annual average increment of 70 million m3. 
<br>
. The area of Sugi forest that already passed the standard cutting age is 
increasing. (11% in 1981-> 17% in 1990)
<br> 
. The percentage of Sugi in the domestic saw log production is on the rise. 
(33% in 1968 -> 49% in 1992)
<br> 
. The above achievements were attained mainly by the efforts of the people in 
upstream villages engaged ih forestry for vigorous silvicultural activities and 
sustainable forest management. 
<br>
. Proper implementation of the Forest Planning System, Protection Forest System, 
and land conservation projects. 
. Observance of allowable harvest in principle below annual increment since the 
50's. 
<br>
+ In response to the diverse demands on forest in recent years, new policies for 
forest improvement were adopted which include adequate nurturing of planted 
forests such as tending and thinning, prolonged cutting age, uneven-aged forest, 
tended natural forest work for establishing non-coniferous stand. 
<P>
Improvement of forest productivity
<P> 
+ Forestry mechanization progressed and labor productivity improved. 
<br>
. Log production: 1 .3m3/man'day in 1968 ->2.4m3 in 1985 (1.8 times increase) 
<br>
. Comparison of productivity for silvicultural works in FY 1964 and FY 1991 
<br>
showed improvements of 1.3 times for land preparation, 1.5 times for planting, 
and 1.9 times for weeding. ' 
<br>
+ Introduction of high performance forestry machinery using high-tech 
mechatronics is progressing lately. (23 machines in 1988 -> 495 in 1992) 
<P>
+ Diversification of management to cover wood processing, civil work, construction, 
etc. is strived for in order to stabilize forestry management, and maintain and 
enhance profitability. 
<br>
+ Promotion of cooperative operations by forest owners' associations contributed to 
the improvement of rationalization of forestry production and improvement of labor 
productivity. 
<br>
i) Share of forest owners' associations in private planted forests (1 991) 
<P>. area of new planting 82%<P>
. area of thinning 67%
<P> 
ii) Progress of establishment of Prefectural Afforestation Corporation (45 
corporations as of January 1994) . 
<br>
Im rovement of forestry labor safety 
<br>
+ Although the occurrence of forestry labor accidents is still at a higher level than 
the all-industries average, both the incidence (number of accidents per one 
million hours of labor) and the intensity (loss days per 1,000 days of labor) were 
reduced. 
<br>
. The incidence in 1992 was 58% of 1964. 
<br>
. The intensity in 1992 was 15% of 1964. 
<P>
<img src="fig-5.gif">
<P>
Development of wood industries 
<P>
+ Enlargement of sawmills progressed. 
<br>
. Output Power per sawmill: 31.6kw (1964)->80.8kw (1992) 
<br>
+ New use of wood progressed such as laminated timber and LVL 
<br>. Production of laminated timber in 1 992 was about 29 times that of 1 964. 
<br>. Production of large section structural laminated timber in 1 992 was about 1 1 5 
times that of 1983. 
<br>+ Handling size of log distribution points was enlarged in order for efficient supply 
of domestic logs. 
<br>. Handling volume of a log market: 13,000m3 (1968) ->18,000m3 (1991) 
<br>+ Rationalization of housing construction from the wood supply side was promoted 
with the increased use of pre-cut materials. 
<br>. Number of pre-cut mills in 1994: 654 
<br>+ New use of wood is progressing. 
<br>. Since 1986, the Technology Research Consortium has been developing fiber 
containing wood-extract substance, interior materials for vehicles, and wood 
carbon fiber and other new materials. 
<P>
<B><h3>(2) Problems during the 30 years</B></h3>
<P> 
Stagnant forestry production and declining self-sufficiency of wood 
<P>
+ Forestry production declined and log production decreased. 
<br>. Forestry production (real terms): \949.3 billion in 1970 ->\624.2 billion in 
1992 
<br>. Log production: 50.68 million m3 in 1964 -> 27.11 million m3 in 1992 
<br>+ Self-sufficiency in industrial wood declined as wood imports increased. 
<br>. Wood self-sufficiency: 72.9% in 1964 ->25.0% in 1 992 
<P>
Weakenin forestry profitability and widening gap in income between other industries 
<P>
+ Forestry profitability worsened due to the stagnant wood price as a result of 
increased wood imports and intensifying competition with non-wood materials, 
and to the rising management cost. 
<br>. Investment return for Sugi plantation: 6.3% in FY 1965-~ 0.9% in FY 1992 
<br>. Dependence on forestry income by agri/forestry household (5-20 ha ownership) 
9.5% in FY 1971 ->2.7% in FY 1991 
<br>+ In proportion to the wood imports increase, the wood price was gradually led by 
imported wood and stayed stagnant. 
<br>. Price of medium size Sugi log: \18,900/m3 in 1970->23,200 in 1992 
( a drop of 33% in real terms) 
<br>+ The gap between the forestry and all-industries average incomes widened. 
<br>. Rate of forestry income against all-industries average: 
20-50ha stratum 39.5% in FY 1972-> 6.5% in FY 1992 
50-100ha stratum 83.1% in FY 1972-> 20.0% in FY 1992 
1OO-500ha stratum 242.7% in FY 1972->74.7% in FY 1992 (below all-
industries average since FY 1980)
<P>
<img src="fig-7.gif"> 
<P>+ Depopulation of villages in upstream areas, and shrinkage and aging of forestry 
workforce continued. 
<br>. Number of forestry workers: 440,000 in 1960 ->110,000 in 1990 
<br>. Aging quotient (% of 50 years and older):23.7% in 1960->67.9% in 1990 
<br>+ Insufficient utilization of domestic wood sometimes led to inadequate caretaking 
of forest. 
<br>. The growing stock of Sugi stands above standard cutting age in 1 990 was 1 .7 
times as large as that in 1 981 but the log production was only 1.1 times. 
<br>. Only 53% of the timber from thinning was used in FY 1992. 
<br>. The percentage of non-resident forest ownership increased: 
15% in 1970 ->22% in 1990 
<br>+ International competitiveness of the wood industries is weak. 
<br>i) Domestic wood supply is small and sporadic. Rationalization of production and 
distribution is lagging behind. Stable supply ability both in quantity and quality 
is questionable. 
<br>. If taking the price of medium-size Sugi log in 1993 as 1OO, the price of sugi 
sawn square is 273, Hemlock log 1 1 8 and Hemlock sawn square 254. 
<br>ii) Delayed action in meeting the structural changes in wood supply e.g. recent 
upsurge of finished products imports 
. Percentage of finished products impors in total volume of wood import: 
19.5% in 1964->66.3% in 1 992 
<P>
<B><h3>(3) Backgrounds of the problems</B></h3> 
<P>
Basically, forestry is a primary industry with a characteristic of a very long period of 
production as it deals with forest and, therefore, has an intrinsic handicap against 
other sectors which developed rapidly in th'e process of Japan's economic growth. 
In addition, the environment for forest/forestry also changed during the 30 years. 
<P>
Internationalization 
<P>
+ Liberalization of wood trade which was implemented gradually in the late 50's 
and was completed in 1964 brought a significant impact on forestry and wood 
industries that were mainstays of local economies. 
<br>+ The Plaza Agreement (1985) and the ensuing precipitant high yen movement 
triggered increased import of finished wood products. Furthermore, in GAπ 
Uruguay Round, wood exporting countries, despite their domestic environment 
protection issues and resource constraints, demanded that Japan eliminate import 
tariffs on forest Products from the standpoint of maintaining and developing their 
respective economies. These movements will not only affect forest maintenance 
and management in Japan but also adversely affect global environment if 
sustainable forest management is not done in exporting countries. 
<P>
<img src="fig-9.gif">
<P>
Urbanization and industrialization 
<P>+ During the period of high economic growth, concentration of industries and 
Population to large cities mostly in the Pacific belt occurred and brought 
depopulation to villages in upstream areas. 
<br>+ Relocation of corporations overseas expanded along with internationalization 
and hollowing of the overall Japanese industries is being pointed out. 
<P>
<B><h3>2 Toward the epoch of forest and trees
<br>
(1)Changes that have potentials to realize the epoch of forest and trees 
</B></h3>
Uncertain wood im orts and augmenting Japan's forest resources 
<br>+ With the background of reinforced environmental regulations in wood producing 
countries, wood imports are becoming uncertain. As seen in the acute 
fluctuation of prices of imported wood, international wood demand/supply is also 
becoming unstable. 
<br>. The price of Lauan peeler log: 100(Aug. 1992), 179(June 1993), 144(Dec. 1993) 
<br>. The price of Hemlock log: 100(Feb. 1992), 120(June 1993),110(Dec. 1993) 
<br>+ Forest resources in Japan are being solidified in preparation for the epoch of 
domestic wood. 
<P>
Chane in sense of values toward forest 
<br>+ The sense of values of the general public toward forest is changi
 The sense of values of the general public toward forest is changing in the 
direction of seeking multiple public benefit functions in addition to wood 
production. 
<br>+ There has been growing interest in the roles of forestry to contribute to creation of 
better environment. 
<br>. Value estimation of public benefit functions of Japan's forest: \39 trillion 
<br>. National forest has been divided into four types: Land conservation forest, nature 
preservation forest, total utilization forest, timber production forest. 
<br>. Forest Biosphere Reserves in Yakushima and Shirakami Mountain Range have 
been registered on the World Heritage List under the Convention for the 
Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage. 
<P>
Wood is amenable to both global environment and human beings
<P>+ The value of wood is being re-appreciated along with the growing interest in 
forest conservation at a global level and the importance of sustainable 
management. 
<br>. Tropical forests are feared to disappear in 80-129 years if the current trend 
continues. (in 58 years for continental South East Asia) 
<br>. About 20% of CO2 emittance from Japan's energy consumption is absorbed 
and fixed by forest. 
<br>. The amount of CO2 stocked in the timber used for housing in Japan is equivalent 
to about 40% of that in the plantation forest. 
<br>. Construction of "traditional wooden houses" emit half of CO2 Per area compared 
with "reinforced prefab houses", and wood materials emit less than 10%. 
<br>. Curves and sways produced by annual growih rings give human beings a sense 
of nature and relaxation. 
<P>
<img src="fig-11.gif">
<P>Health and high-quality life 
<P>+ People are oriented toward building a high quality life supported by "rich green 
and water" and "culture of wood". 
<br>. The supply of drinking water in containes in 1 991 (244,000 kl) was about 1 3 
times as large as that of 1975. 
<br>. 10% concentration of hiba timber oil controls proliferation of ticks. 
<br>. Effect of curves and warps of annual growih rings on human beings to give a 
sense of nature and relaxation. 
<br>. Percentage of wooden houses: 41%(1988) -> 48%(1992) 
<br>. Wooden buildings in public school facilities increased in area by 1 20 times from 
1984 to 1993. 
<br>. Output of wooden toys in value in 1 991 was 2.7 times of 1 965. 
<br>. OutPut value of wooden desks, tables and chairs in 1991 was 6.3 times of 1967. 
<P>
Promotion of fores/forestry international cooperation 
<P>+ Japan is now possessed of the economic and technical capabilities for promoting 
international forest/forestry cooperation. 
<br>. Monetary cooperation in the forms of loans and grants started in 1 978 and 
extended to 30 cases in 13 countries by October 1993. 
<br>. Project type technical cooperation started in 1976 and by December 1 993 
implemented 20 projects in 13 countries. 
<br>. Total of about 830 long-term experts mainly from Forestry Agency were 
dispatched. About 80 People are constantly working overseas. 
<P>
<B><h3>(2) Tasks in order to attain an epoch of forest and trees </B></h3>
<P>
The prerequisite of attaining an epoch of forest and trees is maintenance and 
development of villages in upstream areas by promoting comprehensive measures 
with the cooperation of government offices concerned. 
<P>
Tasks 
<br>+ Maintain and develop forestry as industry from the region wide perspective. 
<br>. Establishment of viable forest management under the River Basin Forest 
Management System, improvement of forest resources to meet market needs, 
improvement of forestry production infr~structure such as forest roads, 
strengthening of management by introduction of high performance forestry 
machinery, securing successors, etc. 
<br>+ Facilitate contribution of foresVforestry to the creation of good environment. 
. Maintain healthy forest resources through the establishment of diverse forests 
Placing importance on ecosystems such as promotion of prolonged cutting age 
and uneven aged forest work, promotion of tending and thinning. PreseNation 
of natural forest and proper application of Forest Planning System and 
Protection Forest System.
<P>
<img src="fig-13.gif"> 
<P>
Source:Japan Wood Information Center,"Report on the Survey for the Promotion of Wood Use (volume on affective)",1992
<P>+ Promote total utilization of forest Paying due attention to forest conservation 
<br>. Improve the conditions for forest recreation, education and cultural activities 
while paying due attention to forest conservation, and promote exchange 
between upstream villages and cities. 
<P>+ Consolidate the system of wood production, processing and distribution with a 
view towards an epoch of domestic timber. 
<br>. Ensure a stable supply of logs, develop and extend new use of wood that meets 
consumers' needs reflecting the change in construction methods, restructuring 
of wood industries including shift into new business areas and conversion of raw 
materials, establishing an overall production/distribution system that organically 
combines wood production/processing/distribution and housing construction. 
<P>+ Promote wood trade that is compatible with sustainable forest management. 
<br>. Japan will maintain and strengthen sustainable forest management following 
"The Year 2000 objective" under the new International Tropical Timber 
Agreement (ITTA) and the consuming countries' joint statement for attaining 
sustainable forest management. Japan will continue its efforts for building 
international rules on wood trade with a perspective of conserving all the forests 
in the world be it tropical, temperate, frigid, wood exporting countries' or 
importing countries'. 
<br>. Japan will thus contribute to building an economy and society where 
sustainable development is possible by ensuring global environment 
conservation and nature's regeneration ability. 
<P>+ Actively promote international foresVforestry cooperation. 
<br>. Building upon the achievements of forest maintenance over the past half 
century, Japan will promote foresVforestry cooperation that contributes to forest 
conservation and sustainable management in developing countries at bilateral, 
multi-lateral, governmental, and non-governmental levels. 
<P>
Forest/forestry in Japan is facing adversity. In order for Japan to develop as truly a 
country of forest into the 21st century, wide support from the people in the nation is 
indispensable to tackle the issues of renaissance of villages in upstream areas and 
forestry. At the same time what are required are, a shifting of life style from the 
resources squandering seen in the process of high economic growth to appropriate 
use of renewable forest resources, promotion df wood recycling, continued energy 
saving efforts, which lead to a life style symbiotic with global environment. Realizing 
the importance of forest for conseNation of the global environment, it is necessary to 
promote appropriate use and protection of forest within the sustainable forest 
management especially for tropical forest, and to further proper forest management 
through increased utilization of domestic timber in Japan.

<B><h2>2 FORESTRY AND VILLAGES IN UPSTREAM AREAS</B></h2>
<P> 
<h3><B>1 Recent trends in forestry production</B></h3> 
<P>
Forest plantation 
<br>+ The area of forest Plantation has been decreasing due to diminishing size of land 
suitable for new plantations, shift of forest improvement Policy, and lowering 
profitability of forestry. 
<br>
Thinning
<br>+ Further utilization of thinning logs is important for effective use of forest resources. 
Development of technology and its practical application of using softwood 
thinning logs for shiitake mushroom is called for. 
<br>Forest road network 
<br>+ From the viewpoints of productivity enhancement and improvement of conditions 
for settlement in upstream village§, it is important to improve main forest roads 
and networks, and improve village sewage systems. 
<br>Log production 
<br>+ Log production is on the decrease due to an inadequate system of production/ 
processing/distribution, a declining workforce,and resource constraints. 
<br>+ Production of Sugi is increasing: 8.82 million m3 jn 1992 (+4% against Previous 
year), 33'/o of domestic timber production, 49% of domestic sawlog production. 
Consolidation of stable domestic timber supply is necessary to realize epoch 
domestic timber. 
<br>Non-wood forest roducts 
<br>+ The production of non-timber forest Products which is an important source of 
income in upstream villages was about the same level as the previous year 
(\38.8 billion) reflecting the consumers' preference for health, nature and 
authenticity. 
<br>Breeding 
<br>+ Since FY 1993, preservation of genes has started for large trees and old/famous 
trees (national monuments). 
Fores forest education 
<br>+ "Forest/Forestry Education Center" was established in FY 1993. Various 
information is disseminated from the Center e.g. Iist of leaders, activity case 
studies, and reference books for youth, etc. 
<h3><B>2 Recent trends in forestry management system</h3></B>
Establishment of river basin forest management system
<br>+It is necessary to establish a system of forest management and domestic timber supply 
system encompassing production ,processing and distribution from upstream through downstream 
for both private and national forests.
<br>.River Basin Forestry Vitalization Centers are scheduled to be established in about
70% of the 158 river basins across the nation by the end of FY 1993.
 both private and national forests.
<br>.As leaders of introducing and instituting river basin management system,13 basin were
selected.
<br>Forest possessors(forest owners,corporations,etc)
<br>+Improvement of forestry management by enlarging forest operation scale is necessary
:economic return of forestry...0.9%(FY 1992)
<P>
<img src="fig-17.gif">
<P>
Forestry enterprises
<br>+ It is imperative to obtain a stable workload, reduce costs, cooperate with other 
sectors, and improve employment conditions in order to maintain sound 
management and secure workforce. 
<br>+ Forest owners' associations are expected to play a core role in river basin forestry 
as a driving force of forestry work in the private sector, 
<br>Forest labor 
<br>+ It is necessary to promote mechanization, improve welfare facilities and 
employmenVcompensation systems in orderto secure forestry iabor. 
. Labor Standard Law was applied totally to forestlV since April, 1 994. 
. In supportof the establishment of endowment fund for securing labor for forest 
improvement, \50 billion assistance to local governments was made in n/ 1 993. 
<br>Forest loans 
<br>+ Use of a forestry loan system is encouraged in orderto promote cost reduction, 
introduction of high performance forestry machinery in response to the 
decreasing workforce, enlargement of forestry operation,,and improvement of 
forest road network. 
<P>
<h3><B>3 Damage to forest and countermeasures </h3></B>
Climatic damage 
<br>+ In 1993, typhoons hit Japan frequently as in the case of 1 991 , and caused serious 
<br>damage to about 10,000 ha of private forest mostly in Kagoshima and Kumamoto. 
. A task force was established to discuss promotion and expansion of use of wind-
blown trees. 
<br>Damage by animals and insects 
<br>+ Damage by deer is increasing. Countermeasures are being discussed at the 
"Inter-agency meeting on protection and control of wild life". , 
<br>Acid rain 
<br>+ It is feared in recent years that the forest ecosystem is being affected by acid rain. 
Establishment of forest work techniques that keep the health of forest is being 
attempted by identifyjng damage caused by acid rain and conducting research on 
the effect of acid rain on forest trees in mountain areas. 
<P>
<h3><B>4 Recent trends in villages in upstream villages</h3></B> 
+ In order to protect and maintain forest, it is necessary to build vital villages . 
<br>. Population of upstream villages (designated) is only 4% of the national total, but 
they occupy 47% of the national land and 61% of the total forest. 
<br>. Depopulation and aging.....20% of residents 65 years or older (12% nationally) 
<br>. Delayed infrastructure.....drinking water system 79%. (95% for non-designated 
villages), flush toilet 22% (68%), paved road 51% (68%), medical doctor per 
thousand people 0.9 (2.8) 
<br>."The Law concerning the Promotion of the Improvement of Basic Conditions of 
Agriculture, Forestry and other Businesses in Hilly and Mountainous Areas" was 
enacted in June, 1993. 
<br>. It is necessary to develop industries capitalizing on local resources. 
<br>+ it is important to promote exchange between cities and upstream villages. 
<br>. In 1991 , 81% of designated villages (965 municipalities) organized creative 
business and events, e.g. direct delivery service, sister cities, ownership sales. 
<br>. It is important to look for new approaches to enjoy beautiful green and nature.

<B><h2>3 ROLE OF NATIONAL FOREST OPERATION AND MANAGEMENT REFORM</B></h2> 
<P>
<h3><B>1 Role of National Forest Operation and the progress of Its undertakings </h3></B>
Role of National Forest O eration 
<br>+ It is expected to play an important role as the core of Japan's forest/forestry i.e. 
public benefit functions, a sustainable supply of forest products on a programmed 
basis, and contribution to local economy. 
<br>. 20% of total land area, 30% of forest area, 1/4 of domestic timber supply 
<br>.Forest management by function types: national land conservation forest, nature 
preservation forest, total utilization forest, and timber production forest. 
<br>. Active participation in establishing river basin forest management systems. 
<br>Public benefit functions 
<br>+ The Forest Biosphere ReseNes for Yakushima and Shirakarni Mountain Range 
will be registered on the Natural Heritage List underthe Convention for the 
Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage. 
<br>Closeness to nature 
<br>+ The National Forest Operation is promoting Profit Sharing Silviculture (Green 
Owner) that co-finances with the state and fosters forest, in response to the 
growing movement to participate in nurturing forest. 
<br>. "Corporate Forest' is being supported by 8 companies for Middle-term Profit-
sharing Silviculture and 6 companies for Long-term Profit-sharing Afforestation. 
<br>. Human Green Plan is being implemented at 23 sites. 
<br>Timber supply 
<br>+ The National Forest Operation is actively promoting sales and extension of logs 
and sawn timber of "Dry Logs" (natura[ly dried stems without limbing). 
<br>. In 1992 the NFO supplied 7.18 million m3. 
<P>
<h3><B>2 Implementation of management reform and new endeavors</h3></B> 
Financial situation 
<br>+ The NFO is still under severe financial situation due to the difficulty of securing 
revenue as a result of reduced harvesting volume, and to the increasing payment 
of interest and capital on the accumulated debt. 
 <br>Mana ement reform 
 <br>+ Based on the new Reform Plan formulated in July 1 991 , the NFO is making efforts 
to achieve revenue/expenses balance for the ordinary operating areas by the 
year 2000 such as organizational simplification and rationalization, and 
downsizing the employment to appropriate level. 
 <br>New endeavors 
 <br>+ Long-term agreements were made with 30 forestry enterprises by the end of 
December 1993, which ensures stable and long-term combined contractual 
agreements for log production, silviculture, thinning and sales. 
 <br>+ With the creation of Rare Wildlife Protection & Control Project, control of habitat 
is being implemented for such species as blakistone fish owls, Japanese cranes, 
etc.s

<B><h2>4 WOOD DEMAND/SUPPLY AND WOOD INDUSTRIES</B></h2>
<P> 
<h3><B>1 Recent trends in wood demand and supply </h3></B>
Wood demand and housin construction 
<br>+ Total wood demand in 1992 declined for industrial timber, shiitake mushroom 
logs, and fuel wood.  
<br>+ As for the supply of industrial timber in 1992, domestic timber decreased by 3%. 
against the previous year and imported timber by 3.4%. 
<br>. Self-sufficiency in industrial timber was 25.0%,the same level as previous year. 
<br>. The supply of Sugi has been on the rise since 1985 and showed 4.5% increase. 
<br>+ The new housing starts in 1993 were 1,486,000, 5.9% up from previous year. 
<br>. Floor area per house showed steady increase: 108 m2 jn 1993. 
<br>. Percentage of wooden houses in 1993 was in the same level of previous year: 
46.9% in 1993. 
<br>+ The production of paper and paperboard in 1993 was 27.77 million ton, 1.9%. 
down against Previous year. 
<br>. The percentage of domestic wood chips is decreasing recently due to strong yen 
( 51% in 1988 -> 41% in 1992) 
<br>. It is important to solidity the system of a stable and efficient supply of raw 
material including the use of thinning logs, insect damages timber, cannibalized 
wood from deconstruction, and improved use of recycled paper. 
<P>
Recent trends in wood imports 
<br>+ Wood import is on the increase since 1987. Import of logs is decreasing but 
import in the form of finished products is increasing, 
<br>+ The Uruguay Round reached an substantial agreement at the Trade Negotiation 
Committee on December 15, 1993. Japan offered about a 50% reduction of 
import tariff from the base rate. 
<br>. Over the next 5 years, sawn and planed timber of SPF(Spruce, Pine, Fir) will be 
reduced from 8% to 4.8%, and plywood from 10-15% to 6-10%. 
<br>+ Japan needs to ensure stable import of timber commensurate with demand with a 
view to the epoch of domestic timber supported by maturing forest resources. 
<br>+ President Clinton announced in July 1993 "The Forest Plan For a Sustainable 
Economy and Sustainable Environment". 
<br>. Havesting volume from the federal forest west of the Cascade mountains will be 
reduced to the total of 12 billion BF (approximately 54.3 million m3) in 10 years. 
<br>+ Malaysia is tightening export control on unprocessed timber. 
<br>. Sarawak implemented reduction of harvesting volume since September 1992. 
<br>. Since January 1993, Sabah adopted a temporary ban of log export and raised 
substantially the export tariff on wood products.  
<br>+ Indonesia lifted the total ban on log export in May 1992 but it is virtually 
impossible to export logs because of the high export tax. 
<br>. In the middle of 1991 the export tax on sawn timber was raised again. Export of 
roughly sawn timber is virtually impossible. 
<br>. Indonesia's export of plywood expanded drastically. In 1992, the export was 
9.54 million m3, up 9.4% against the previous year (28% of which is for Japan). 
<br>+Import of Russian timber had been on the decline but its supply to Japan is 
recovering recently. 
<P>
<img src="fig-23.gif">
<P>
<h3><B>2 Recent trends in wood prices</h3></B> 
+ The prices of imported timber rose in a fluctuating manner recently due to 
reduction of harvesting volume and log export restrictions in exporting counties. 
In the beginning of 1993 there was an upward trend in the market. The domestic 
prices did not rise as high as those in exporting countries due to the high yen. 
The price of domestic Sugi was higher than that of the previous year. 
<br>. The price of Douglas Fir logs rose considerably from February 1992 until June 
1993, then softened (annual average was 13% up). 
<br>. The price of Western Hemlock logs rose considerably from December 1992 until 
June 1 993, then softened (annual average 12% up). 
<br>.The prices of Lauan both for sawlogs and peeler logs rose sharply from August 
1992 until June 1993, then softened (annual average 18% up and 51% up). 
<br>.The price of Sugi logs rose from August 1992 until March 1993, then leveled off. 
(annual average 3% up). 
<br>. The price of Hinoki logs showed a similar trend to that of Sugi. 
<P>
<h3><B>3 Recent trends in wood industries</h3></B> 
<P>
Management of wood industries 
<br>+ The number of bankruptcies in 1993 in the wood products manufacturing sector 
decreased by 12 against the previous year and in the sales sector increased by 
14. 
<br>+ National Federation of Wood Cooperatives put forward a wood industries' vision 
toward the 21st century in December 1993 which thrusts a shift from excessive 
dependency on imported wood to domestic wood. 
<br>Wood distribution and rocessin 
<br>+ It is important that the supply system of domestic timber be improved to ensure 
highly finished quality products in large quantity at low cost. As production of sugi 
timber of general quality is anticipated to increase in the future, enlargement and 
expansion of distribution lot is required to meet the needs of the demand side. 
<br>+ Reduction of the number of sawmills is occurring in the smaller size category. 
Output Power per mill is constantly increasing.  
<br>+ The number of plywood and veneer mills is decreasing (506 mills in 1992) but the 
demand for laminated lumber is increasing and so is the numberof its producers 
(there were 281 producers and the production in 1992 was 451,000 m3). 
Production of large cross-section structural laminated lumber showed upward 
trend recently. There are 19 LVL manufacturing plants and the production is 
expected to increase for structural use as well.

<B><h2>5 WORLD FOREST RESOURCES AND JAPAN'S INTERNATIONAL FOREST/FORESTRY COOPERATION </B></h2>
<P>
<h3><B>1 State of world forest resources, global environment issues, and wood trade</h3></B> 
State of world forest resources 
<br>+ The area of tropical forest dropped from 1,910 million ha in 1980 to 1,756 million 
ha in 1990 (annual average of 15.4 million ha decrease). 
<br>+ The area of forest and other wooded land in the developed temperate-zone 
countries was 2,060 million ha as of 1990 (39% of the total land area). 
<br>+ If damage to the forest in Europe can be gauged by the defoliation, 23.5%. 
of the trees were more than 25% defoliated in 1992. 
<P>International efforts for lobal environment issues 
<br>+ It was pointed out from the beginning that the importance of the "United Nations 
Conference on Environment and Development (Earth Summit)" would be the 
unilateral and international post conference actions. 
<br>. The outline of the "Commission on Sustainable Development " was decided as 
a follow-up to the Earth Summit. 
<br>+ In December 1993, Japan formulated "Agenda 21 " action plans incorporating 
NGOs' opinions. 
<br>+ A number of international conferences on forest and forestry such as "Global 
Forest Conference (in Indonesia)" were held following the Earth Summit. 
<br>+ Seven "Carbon Offsets" projects that utilize forest's"function as a carbon sink are 
implemented in six countries. 
<br>. An average of 250 tons of CO2 (in terms of carbon) is fixed by conserving 1 ha of 
tropical forest, and by establishing 1 ha of forest 10 tons of CO2 is fixed annually, 
<P>World wood supply demand and wood trade 
<br>+ The world's log consumption in 1991 was 3,430 million m3. 
<br>+ The world's industrial wood production was 1,600 million m3 (conifers 67%, 
hardwood 33%) 
<br>. The traded volume was less than 8% of the production. 
<br>+ Major exporting countries of industrial roundwood are USA, Malaysia, and former 
USSR and they occupy 50% of the total export in the world, whereas Japan, 
China, and Korea occupy 50% of the total import. 
<br>+ International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO) established underthe ITTA is 
strengthening its policy making activities as shown in the adoption of the strategic 
goal of "achieving exports of tropical timber and timber products from 
sustainably managed sources by the year 2000". 
<br>+ After the revision negotiation of ITTA, the new agreement was adopted that clearly 
upholds "The Year 2000 Objective" and attempts to create a new fund for 
sustainable management of tropical forest. 
<br>+ OECD and GATT are also discussing how to achieve compatibility of wood trade 
and environment conservation.

<h3><B>2 japan's efforts for international forest/forestry cooperation </h3></B>
Bilateral forest/forestry cooperation 
<br>+ The project-type technical cooperation through Japan International Cooperation 
Agency (JICA) is expanding in number and diversitying in content. 
<br>. As of December 1993, there are 20 projects in 13 countries. 
<br>+ Japan also carries out development suNey, development cooperation, Ioan 
assistance and grant aid. 
<P>Cooperation throu h international organization 
<br>+ Japan participated in the formulation of Tropical Forests Action Programme 
(TFAP) which aims at maintaining/establishing tropical forest and ensuring 
appropriate use, and donated a trust fund to the Food and Agriculture 
Organization of the United Nations (FAO) for the purpose. 
<br>. As a multi-lateral trust fund: US$ 394,000 a year (FY 1988-FY 1990) 
<br>. As a trust fund for preparing urgent plantation plan: US$ 349,000 (FY 1991-FY 
1993) 
<br>+ Japan is the largest donor to ITTO. 
<br>. In 1993, assessed contribution was \85 million and voluntary contribution \1.56 
billion. 
<br>+ Financial contribution and dispatch of a director and experts are arranged for to 
support International Center for research in Agroforestry (ICRAF) and Center for 
International Forestry Research (CIFOR). 
<br>\183 million to CIFOR and \61 million to ICRAF (in FY 1993) 
<P>Other international fores forest cooperation 
<br>+ In order to contribute to the maintenance and enrichment of forest resources and 
enhancement of forestry productivity, the overseas forestry cooperation project is 
actively implemented e.g. survey and analysis of forest condition by remote 
sensing, and improvement of the information service system. 
<br>+ Japan International Forestry Promotion and Cooperation Center (JIFPRO) is 
promoting extensive activities such as recruitment/training of human resources, 
collection/compilation/dissemination of technical information, support of NGOs' 
cooperative activities, extension/education of international greening. 
<br>+ NGOs' efforts include improvement of local people's living environment and forest 
Plantation for prevention of global warming by CO2 sink/fixation. 
<br>. The Organization for Industrial, Spiritual and Cultural Advancement (OISCA) is 
carrying out "Children Forest Program" (an attempt to help children understand 
the importance of forest through the establishment of school's forest) at about 
300 schools in 11 countries.

<B><h2>Epilogue</B></h2> 
The world today, after the end of the cold war, is witnessing the progress of a market 
economy beyond the differences of social regimes and an intensifying 
interdependence in all aspects such as politics, economy and culture. The Uruguay 
Round, which was virtually agreed upon recently, was driven forward under these 
circumstances with the banner of free trade promotion. On the other hand, discussions 
on economy versus resources and global environment have been vehemently held, 
kicked off by the "limitation of growth" by the Rome Club in 1972 and proposals at the 
recent "Earth Summif' We should be prepared that, as mankind's economic activities 
become more and more extensive and reach a colossal scale on the finite earth, the 
issues of resources and environment may confront the future course of free trade and 
free economy. 
<P>Japan, while developing its economy, has become one of the world's highly forested 
countries where about 70% of the land is covered by 10 million ha of plantation 
forests. These forests, presently in a maturing stage, were revived from the dilapidated 
state during and after the War by the incessant efforts of the people residing in villages 
in upstream areas. Today, forestry that has long nurtured forest is in adversity and at 
the turning point whether it can rejubinate toward the 21st century. 
Japan is, at the same time, expected to have a long-term perspective and realize the 
epoch of forest and trees, based on its built up potential for the development of forest 
and forestry. 
<P>With the above basic understanding, in order for Japan to contribute to sustainable 
economic development symbiotic with global environment in the area of forest/forestry 
while developing its f,orestry and wood industries as a country continuing to be  
enriched with forest, the following tasks should be actively addressed.  
<br>The first is to vitalize upstream villages that support forest. 
<br>The second is to maintain and develop forestry as an industry.  
<br>The third is to promote forest/forestry's contribution to creation of the environment. 
<br>The fourth is to envisage the epoch of domestic timber and improve the system of  
wood production, processing, and distribution. 
<br>The fifth is to implement management reform of the National Forest Operation 
thereby ensuring national forest's important roles into the future. 
<br>The sixth is to actively promote international forest/forestry cooperation. 
<P>Needless to say, self-help efforts of the people engaged in forestry and wood 
industries are indispensable to achieve the above. However, considering the difficult 
situation villages in upstream areas and forestry are placed in, and also the fact that 
forest is not only an economic asset to human beings and the Japanese people but 
also a precious environmental asset, understanding and strong support of all the 
people in the nation is necessary. At the same time, for Japan to truly realize the 
epoch of forest and trees, a shift of life style is required from that of resource 
squandering seen along with high economic growth to one that is symbiotic with the 
global environment.

<h2><B>PROLOGUE</B></h2> 
<p>
<b>1</b> This year is the 50th anniversary of the end of the Worid War II ,
 a significant node in the history of Japan, and we are at the 
threshold of a new era having only several years left before we 
enter the 21st century. After the War, Japan achieved reconstruction 
starting from rubble and, having gone through various stages, 
attained remarkable economic development. Today, it is one of the 
countries with largest economic scale. 
<p>
<b>2</b> However, Japan is facing unprecedented issues both within and 
outside the country such as limitation of mass production and 
consumption, a change of people's preference from materialistic 
richness to spiritual happiness, a rapidly aging population, 
borderless economy and information, and clear emergence of global 
environmental probiems. A new set of values with a perspective 
into 21st century is sought for. 
<p>
<b>3</b> It has long been known empirically that forests are not only 
source of wood that fills materialistic needs of people and 
industries but also have various functions such as land and water 
conservation. In addition, the roles of forests in recent years 
as sites for recreation for every people including elder generation, 
cultural activities, sports, and education of youth have become 
significant. Furthermore, expectations of forests are growing such 
as for maintenance and creation of a fine living condition and 
landscapes, and for new uses of wood to make residential circumstances 
more comfortable. They match the people's inclination to seek mental
 richness, and expectations of forests tend to be more diverse than 
ever. 
<p>
<b>4</b> These roles of forest, forestry and wood materials were often 
ignored during the period of high economic growth. However, as for 
the present situation of forests, it is noteworthy that Japan still 
maintains rich forests that occupy nearly 70% of the total land. 
This is partly due to the natural conditions and historical circumstances,
 but largely to the efforts of many harbingers who endeavored to 
reconcile both forest conservation and effective utilization. 
Owing greatly to them, people in the nation today can still enjoy 
tremendous benefits from forests without realizing their efforts. 
<p>
<b>5</b> Such wisdom for reconciling forest conservation and effective 
utilization, technologies and systems as its crystallized forms, 
and life patterns based on them, can be collectively called "forest 
culture". Since the economy and society are in a momentous transitional
 period, it is expected that reviewing the history of forest culture 
and discussing the possibility of its further development will 
provide valuable suggestions to new orders of economy and society 
in the 21st centuly. By doing so, Japan's role in the solution of 
global environmental issues will become clearer including the 
establishment of compatibility of sustainable management and forest 
conservation which is indispensable to mankind's prosperity into 
the future. 
<p>
<b>6</b> The substance of forest culture lies with "symbiosis" of forest 
and mankind, and "circulation" of materials intrinsic in forests. 
For its further development, on top of the self-help efforts 
of those who are engaged in forest and forestry, people's 
participation in all dimensions is imperative. 
<p>
<b>7</b> From the abovementioned viewpoints, this annual report 
places forestry and wood industries as the primary carriers 
of forest culture, and upstream villages as the site of its 
nurture and regeneration. Thus, the first chapter is entitled 
"For further development of forest culture". The second 
chapter "Forest, forestry, and upstream villages" 
describes the current situation of forests, recent trends 
in forestry production and forestry management, current 
situation and direction for vitalization of upstream villages 
where forestry and agriculture are the mainstay industries. 
The third chapter "Role of National Forest Operation and 
management reform" describes the current situation of the 
National Forest Operation and the progress made toward the
improvement of its management. The fourth chapter "Wood 
demand, supply, and wood industries" gives analyses of wood 
demand and supply, wood import, and movements of wood prices, 
and describes the management situation of wood industries 
and the recent trends in domestic timber distribution. The 
fifth chapter "World forest resources and Japan's international 
forest and forestry cooperation" touches upon the issue of
deforestation in tropical areas which has become one of the 
global environmental problems, the current efforts and future 
tasks of international forest and forestry cooperation, 
and the international attempts for the realization of 
sustainable forest management.

<b>I. FOR FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF FOREST CULTURE</b> 
<p>
<b>1 Forest and Culture</b> 
<p>(1) Forest Culture 
<p>Relationshi between forest and mankind 
<br>The life of human beings since olden times has been closely 
related to forest and wood in various ways. 
<br><ul>
<li>The relationship can be characterized as a "symbiosis" considering 
that a number of early civilizations were supported by gitts from 
forests and depended on their supply of wood and water. 
<br>
<li>"Circulation" of materials takes place in forest and, at the same 
time, forest functions as medium of circulation such as for water. 
Forest's multiple functions are made Possible by its fundamental 
function of organic material production. 
<ul>
<li>Sustainable production of wood and grass is possible if 
exploitation is kept within the limit of reproduction capacity. 
<li>Distribution of forests in the world varies greatly since in 
some regions or countries utilization and exploitation of forests 
have exceeded the reproduction capacity whereas forests have not 
been restored to date.
</ul></ul> 
Forest culture 
<ul>
<li>In Japan, influenced by its climatic and topographic conditions, 
it has been a widely accepted perception that deforestation and 
degradation of forests lead to natural disasters such as floods, 
and that a stable supply of water indispensable for the irrigation 
of rice paddy agriculture is ensured by the existence of forests. 
<br>
<li>As a result, the recognition has grown that forest is an 
indispensable resource for life and industries, and hence the 
wisdom has been developed to benefit in perpetuity by conserving 
and nurturing forest and thereby maximizing its various effioacies. 
In this report, <b>wisdom to effectively utilize forests while 
ensuring their conservation and as its crystallized form technologies,
 systems and the life style based on these</b>, shall be collectively
 expressed by the term <b>forest culture</b>.
</ul>
<p> 
(2) Foundation of Forest Culture in Japan 
<br><ul>
<li>Conservation of forests has been achieved through economic 
activities of forestry, and wisdom and technologies to effectively 
utilize forests and wood have been developed through activities of 
forestry and wood industries. It can be said, therefore, that the 
primary carriers of forest culture are forestry and wood industries, 
and that upstream villages are the field for the generation and 
reproduction of forest culture. 
<br>
<li>Various gifis from forests, realized through activities of forestry
and wood industries which hava developed along streams and river 
basins, pervaded the country. The concept of effectively utilizing 
forests while ensuring conservation was fostered and developed in 
such geographical extension. 
</ul>
<img src="f-1.gif">
<p>
<img src="f-2.gif">
<p>
(3) Closely feit forest culture
<br><ul>
<li>In 1994, there was a severe shortage of water in western Japan 
due to droughty weather from the spring. 
<ul>
<li>More than 15.8 million people were affected by a water cut-off.
</ul></ul>
<ul>
<li>Efrective means to prevent water shortage are to stabilize water 
flow in rivers and to maintain usable water quantity. It is essential 
to capitalize on functions of forests which occupy 2/3 of Japan's 
land and have enormous water storage oapacity. 
<br></ul>
<ul>
<li>Forest is called "green dam" and serves for mitigation of drought 
and flood, and purfication of water. It also prevents soil wash-out 
and landslide, and reduce sedimentary deposits in dams. 
<ul>
<li> In Kanagawa prefecture, water supply control has never been 
necessary. Prefectural Corporate Agency (1959) and Yokohama City 
(1916) established watershed forest in the upstream Doshi River. 
</ul></ul>
<b>2 Relationship of Japanese with Forest and Wood</b> 
<p>
(1) Relationship with forest and wood 
<p>
Daily life
<ul>
<li>In the Jomon period, ways to select appropriate wood according 
its usage were already known.
<ul>
<li> Sugi for a dugout because of its water resistance and easy 
processing, Horse Chestnut for a bowl because of its fine grain, <i>
Daphniphyllum</i> for the grip of an ax still using for the shaft of 
agricultural tools because of its tenacity. 
</ul></ul>
<ul>
<li>Nuts of Conkers and Acorns were part of the diet.
<ul>
<li> They had been used as reserve food until the Meiji era 
(from 1868 to 1911).
</ul></ul>
<ul>
<li>Wood was indispensable for materials of daiiy use such as 
barrels, pails, chopsticks, and furniture. 
</ul>
Houses and buildings 
<ul>
<li>A Iarge quantity of wood was used in the end of the 6th century 
for the construction of large buildings i.e. temples and palaces.
<ul>
<li>Horyuji Temple has stood for more than thousand years, proving 
the fine quality of its wood.
<li>In the 7th century, forest exploitation proceeded and disasters 
such as soii wash-out occurred.
</ul></ul>
<ul> 
<li>In Edo era (from 1603 to 1867), demand for wood sharply increased 
following frequent large-scale fires in cities.
<ul>
<li>Measures to sustain forest resources: "<i>Tomeyama</i>"- prohibition 
of logging in designated forests, "<i>Tomegi</i>"- prohibition of 
felling certain species of trees e.g. "Five Major Tree Species of 
Kiso region"' 
<li>The wooden post and beam joint methods for housing construction 
were perfected in the Edo era and are still in use today.
</ul></ul>
Agriculture
<ul>
<li>Forests were indispensable for rice paddy agriculture to provide 
water resource, grass and fallen leaves for organic fertilizer.
<br>
<li>Forest degradation caused by excessive exploitation consequently 
led to the development of farmers' wisdom to reconcile both forest 
conservation and utilization. 
</ul>
<img src="f-3.gif">
<p>
<img src="f-4.gif">
<p>
Belief and arts
<ul>
<li>The faith in forest itself as god or belief that gods descend 
upon tall or big trees date back to olden times. Even today, there 
is a faith of 'Yamanokami" that many forest workers believe. There 
are still existing many festivals and habits based on faith in many 
places.
<br>
<li>In performances of literature, paintings, and other arts, rich 
forests that change their appearance from season to season have 
been described. 
</ul>
<p>
(2) The change of people's attitude toward forest and wood in recent 
years 
<br>Durin the period of high economic growth 
<ul>
<li>The relationship between people and forest tended to attenuate.
<ul> 
<li>Increase of wood import: 2.48 million <img src="m3.GIF"> (6% of total consumption)
in 1955 -> 20.16 million <img src="m3.GIF"> (29%) in 1965 -> 82.68 million <img src="m3.GIF"> (76%)
in 1993.
<li> Sharp drop of charcoal purchase (charcoal's share of light and 
fuel expenses): 57.4% in 1947 -> 7.3% in 1965-> 0.10% in 1985 
</ul></ul>
In recent years
<ul>
<li>Movement to seek active contacts with forests and greenery, and 
enhanced interest in forests have been seen. People's attitude has 
been changing from passive to active states.
<ul>
<li> Increase of the number of people who use forests as a field 
for refreshment, sports, and education. 
<li> Increase of peopie who are wishing to participate in nurturing 
forest: 53.6% in 1986 -> 66.2% in 1993 
</ul></ul>
<b>3 Development of Forest Culture in Modern Japan</b>
<p>
(1) "Sustained Harvest" and Forest Establishment
<br>
 Formulation of forest management plan for sustained halrvest 
<ul>
<li>Before the modern era, there existed the recognition that sustained 
harvest of forest products and maintenance of forest functions for 
public benefit can be attained by proper forest management, and that 
maximum harvest is possible by planting species suited to the site.
<ul>
<li> In the Edo era methods to ensure sustainable wood production 
were known (Banyama, Banguriyama, Jungiriyama, etc.). 
<li> In 1894, a "Forest Management Plan" was prepared for national 
forest, which is equivalent to the Forest Plan today including 
methods and quantity of logging, and how to restore forest. 
</ul></ul>
Development of forest management technology 
<ul>
<li>The technology of plantation forest has been developed for maximum 
and sustainable production of desired wood, and rapid and certain 
recovery of devastated forest.
<ul>
<li> The forests devastated during and afier the World War II were 
recovered by Plantation supported by the nation-wide greening movement
 (10 million ha of plantation forest has been established to the 
present).
</ul></ul>
<ul>
<li>Multi-storied forest management and tended natural forest management
 have been actively introduced. 
</ul>
<img src="f-5.gif">
<br>
<img src="f-6.gif">
<p>
(2) Protection Forest System and Protected Forest System 
<br>Creation of the rotection forest system 
<br>Since the 7th century there had been various orders to prohibit 
or restrict logging and forest exploitation in many parts of the 
country, and in the Edo era certain forests played roles equivalent 
to protection forests today. 
<ul>
<li>Building on to the various endeavors up to the Edo era, the 
protection forest system was established under the Forest Law (1897) 
in the Meiji era. 
<ul>
<li> Classification of protection forest similar to today's: 
Tide Damage Prevention Forest, Fish Trap Forest, Navigation Target 
Forest, Scenic Site Preservation Forest, Public Health Forest, etc. 
<li> Today 1/3 of the total forest is designated (an aggregate of 
8.9 million ha as protection forests), and the system has been 
solidified constantly. 
</ul></ul>
Creation of the Protected Forest System.
<ul>
<li>In 1915, preceding the enactment of the National Park Law, the 
protected forest system in the National Forest was established for 
the protection forest for academic research, scenic beauty, etc. 
<ul>
<li> These protected forests became many of the scenically important 
sites of the early national parks. 
</ul></ul>
<ul>
<li>In 1989, restructuring and expansion of the protected forest 
system was done including the review of the existing protected forest 
and creation of Forest Biosphere Reserves (preservation of primeval-
like forest for both flora and fauna).
<ul>
<li> Shirakami Mountain Range and Yakushima Island which are registered 
on the World Natural Heritage List are also Forest Biosphere Reserves.
</ul></ul>
(3) Restoration of forests as a basis for safe and comfortable life 
<br>Restoration of forest by modern technology and nurturing of head 
water conservation forest 
<br>The concept of forest conservation started prevailing as 
exemplified in the promulgation of "Yamakawa-no-okite" (forest and 
riverside conservation rules) which ordered tree planting in upstream 
areas. 
<ul>
<li>Toward the end of the Edo era, many districts suffered from flood 
due to overexploited forests. Recovery of damaged forests continued 
to be an important issue into the Meiji era and, therefore, many 
experts such as J.Drijke were invited from Holland. 
<ul>
<li> As a Japanese, Kinbara Meizen in the early Meiji era is well 
known for the establishment of watershed forest in the Tenryu River 
basin. 
<li> In Tokyo, a city water conservation forest of 22,000 ha has 
been established in the upstream Tama River since 1903. 
</ul></ul>
Program-based implementation of land conservation work
<ul>
<li>In 1911,"The Phase I Forest Improvement and Watershed Management 
Project" was started.
<ul>
<li> The 8th Five Year Programme of Forest Conservation Projects 
is being implemented. 
</ul></ul>
<img src="f-7.gif">
<br>
<img src="f-8.gif">
<p>
Forest improvement for the conservation of livin circumstances and 
natural conditions
<ul>
<li>Since 1971,the "Forest Improvement Project for Living Circumstances 
Conservation" has been implemented to improve the forest in the 
vicinity of residential areas and in 1994 the "Forest Improvement 
Project for Nature Conservation" was launched. 
<ul>
<li> At Utsubuki-yama in Kurayoshi-shi of Tottori prefecture, 
the forest has been improved by "Forest Improvement Project for 
Living Circumstances Conservation" and civil activities for 
establishing squirrels' Iiving forest has been developed. 
</ul></ul>
Nurturing forest for a rich sea
<ul>
<li>It has been recognized that forests contribute to the conservation 
of marine life habitat in their downstream by providing nutritious 
water and preventing wash-out of soil and sand. Efforts to improve 
and nurture forests are being made in order to restore a life-rich sea.
<ul>
<li> At Erimo Point the haul of fish has increased due to the 
recovery of forests set up by land conservation work. 
</ul></ul>
(4) Effective utilization of wood for enrichment of people's lives 
<br>Improvement of wood rocessin techniques
<ul>
<li>Along with the extensive use of mechanical saw milling since the 
latter of Meiji era, sawing pattern techniques have been improved 
and efficient production of sawn timber has been ensured. Construction
 of large wooden buildings such as school buildings are increasing, 
being enabled by the use of large sectional laminated wood. 
</ul>
Expanded use of wood
<ul>
Efficient utilization of wood has been promoted by recycling 
and by using for various purposes.
<ul>
<li>Demand for wooden houses continues to be strong: the ratio of 
wooden houses has been 80% of single houses.
<li>Use of wood has been expanding e.g. for outdoor facilities such 
as bridges and benches, pavement materials, etc. 
</ul></ul>
<b>4 Status Quo of Forestry, Wood Industries, and Upstream Villages 
That Bear Forest Culture</b>
<ul>
<li>Japan has achieved remarkable economic development, while 67% of 
its land is occupied by forest. 
<ul>
<li>(Causes) 1. Difficulty of development in the steep and unexploitable 
mountain regions, 2. Moist temperate monsoon climate which is suitable 
for exuberance of forests, 3. Rice paddy agriculture extensively practiced 
which needs symbiosis with forests, and 4. Nurturing and developing superior 
forest culture. 
</ul></ul>
<ul>
<li>Forestly and wood industries which carried forest culture are now 
facing difficulties and the vitality of upstream villages that 
nurtured and developed forest culture is diminishing. 
<li>As a result, it may become difficult to continue receiving the 
benefit and efficacy from forest. 
</ul>
<img src="tbl-1.gif">
<p>
<img src="f-9.gif">
<p>
Stagnation of forestry
<ul>
<li>The declining profitability of forestry in recent years has 
discouraged forest owners from undertaking forestly operaticns 
such as thinning.
<ul>
<li> Actual price index in 1993 against 1965: stumpage of Sugi 100->70,
 logging wage 100 -> 502, Planting cost 100 -> 929 
</ul></ul>
<ul>
<li>It is difficult to secure a young work force due to the high 
occurrence rate of labor accidents and unstable working hours. 
<ul>
<li> The number of high schooi graduates who entered forestry was 211
 in 1994.
<li> 80,000 out of 110,000 forestry workers are 50 years old or older.
</ul></ul>
Wood industries that are facing severity
<ul>
<li>The costs of production, processing, and distribution of domestic 
wood are relatively higher, caused by small and scattered production 
and distribution. 
<br>
<li>In recent years, it has become difficult for small-sized 
entrepreneurs to secure a stable demand due to the competition 
with large housing corporations which systematized processing and 
distribution of wood materials for housing.
<br>
<li>it is feared that tariff reduction by the settlement of the Uruguay 
Round of GATT might lead to further severity to wood industries.
</ul>
Upstream villages where aging and depopulation roceed
<ul>
<li>In the process of high economic growth, depopulation and aging 
proceeded in upstream villages.
<br>
<li>In addition to various inconveniences in daily lives, it is 
difficult to secure employment opportunities, and the social 
infrastructure is insufficient compared with urban areas. 
<br>
<li>Entering the new phase i.e. natural attrition of population 
(the number of death exceeds that of birth), sustaining the local 
community is likely to become difficult in some villages. 
<ul>
<li> The number of municipalities with natural attrition among 
those designated under the Mountain Village Development Law: 
344 municipalities (29%) in 1981-> 772(65%) in 1991 
</ul></ul>
<b>5 Pursuing Further Development of Forest Culture</b>
<p>
(1)Necessity of Further Development of Forest Culture 
<br>
Forest culture as practical wisdom was generated through close 
contacts of mankind with forest and wood, developed through numerous 
experiences, and has been succeeded throughout the history, changing 
its form with time and circumstances. 
<ul>
Spatial
<br>
<li>Forest culture was transmitted from the narrow area of villages 
to wider areas, and lately, along with urbanization and enlargement 
of metropolis, to across the nation. Furthermore, the influence of 
one nation's industrial activities are likely to expand beyond 
borders and affect global environment. 
<br>
Qualitative 
<br>
<li>Forest culture affects and permeates not only the economic 
efficacy of stably supplying forest Products, but also public 
aspects such as watershed conservation, provision for health 
recreation, education, sports, etc. 
<ul>
<li>It is important to review the relationship between forest 
culture and cities from a new perspective (urban forests are 
part of the living circumstances and wooden houses and products 
serve as carbon dioxide sink). 
<li> The development of technology for new use of wood has a 
potential to improve better living conditions. 
</ul></ul>
<img src="f-10.gif">
<p>
<img src="f-11.gif">
<ul>
<li>In order to meet the expanding, diversifying, and upgrading 
needs for forest and wood, it is necessary not only to inherit 
the traditional forest culture but also to accurately recognize 
its significance and its role at present and to plan for 
further development with a perspective into the future.
<br>
<li>Sustainable management of forests has become an impcrtant 
task today. It behooves Japan to recognize the effectiveness
 of its fine forest culture nurtured within and transmit it 
outwardly to the world, which would solve global environmental
 issues in the course of time. 
</ul>
(2) The Direction of Further Development of Forest Culture
<ul>
<li>It is important to vitalize forestry, wood industries, and 
upstream villages through improvement of forest as a source 
of greenery and water, improvement of the system for production, 
processing, and distribution of local timber, by means of the
 establishment of river basin forest management system, and 
promotion of wood use.
<br>
<li>However, considering the adverse conditions surrounding 
forestry, wood industries, and upstream villages, it is 
doubtful whether they can be vitalized by the efforts only 
of the people on the part of forestry, wood industries, 
and upstream villages. 
<br>
<li>People's inclination to have contacts with forest and 
greenery and to participate in nurturing forests in some 
from or other has been growing, which is regarded as 
fixation and support of forest culture. 
<ul>
<li> Voluntary actions of nurturing forest by means of 
Middle-term Profit-sharing Silviculture, Junior Green 
Friends' Federation, participation for volunteer activities, 
corporation philanthropy, etc. 
<li> Creation of endowment funds for forest improvement 
by the coalition of municipalities in both downstream and 
upstream areas. Activities to improve and nurture forests 
in the upstream in order to restore a rich sea. 
</ul></ul>
<ul>
<li>It is henceforth important to expand the circle of 
people's participation in forest improvement as well 
as to strengthen the nation-wide support in the form 
of cost-sharing of forest improvement, which is a 
efficient foothold to vitalize forestry, wood 
industries, and upstream villages. 
</ul>
There has been an argument that the existence of forest 
will be one of the most critical requirements for the 
survival of human being in the 21st century. In order 
for Japan's forest, forestry and wood industries to 
contribute to enriching people's lives and prospering 
human being, it is essential to shed light from new 
angles to "symbiosis" and "circulation" which are the 
bases of forest culture. 
<p>
There steady efforts should make it establish sustainable 
management of Japanese and world forest, and formulate 
a new social and economic system to enable symbiosis 
with earth environment. 
<p>
<b>Table-2 Examples of new endeavors based on forest culture</b>

<b>II. FOREST, FORESTRY AND UPSTREAM VILLAGES</b>
<p>
<b>1 Forest in Japan</b> 
<ul>
Improvement of forests
<br>
<li>An important task is to establish the river basin forest 
management system for improvement of forests through forestry 
production activities. 
<br>
<li>Improvement of protection forests is important for the 
maintenance and enhancement of public functions of forest. 
<ul>
<li> Revision of the Fifth Plan for Improvement of Protection 
Forest 
</ul></ul>
Roles of forests as expected by the people in Japan 
<ul>
<li>People's expectations of forests have become more diverse. 
</ul>
Various means for forest im rovement
<ul>
<li>There have been cases of cost-sharing of forest improvement 
based on the better awareness of the beneficiaries.
<ul>
<li>More than 80% of the people in Japan recognize the 
importance of downstream and upstream interactions in the future. 
<li>Sharp increase of cost-sharing cases for the improvement 
of water conservation forests (about 100 cases across the nation)
</ul></ul>
Influences of the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake 
<ul>
<li>The Forestry Agency dispatched survey teams to prepare 
a restoration plan, and conducted inspection for the prevention 
of secondary disasters, and carried temporary measures on the 
landslides sites. 
<li>The Forestry Agency ensured wood supply for restoration 
through the National Forest Operation, etc. 
</ul>
<p>
<b>2 Trends in Forestry Production</b>
<p>
Log production 
<ul>
<li>In the overall downward trends, production of Sugi is 
showing an upward trend in recent years supported by the 
increasing volume of halvestable resources (a sign of the 
epoch of domestic wood). 
</ul>
Non-timber forest roducts 
<ul>
<li>Reflecting the consumers' inclination for health and 
authenticity, production of non-timber forest products is 
on the increase in recent years. 
</ul>
Forest plantations
<ul>
<li>The area of annual forest Plantation had been declining 
due to the shift of forest improvement Policy(introduction of 
prolonged cutting age) and low profitability of forestry, 
but showed an increase in 1993. 
</ul>
Thinning
<ul>
<li>It is important to oarry out thinning efficiently by 
collective operation realized through improving road network 
and introducing high performance machinery. 
</ul>
Improvement of road network 
<ul>
<li>An integrated approach is needed to improve forest 
roads network and to improve living environment facilities e.g. 
village sewage systems in order to promote proper forest 
management and improvement of settlement conditions in 
upstream villages. 
</ul>
Introduction of high performance forest machine
<ul>
<li>In all parts of Japan, introduction of high performance 
machinely is rapidly expanding in recent years.
<ul>
<li>739 machines at the end of FY 1993 (49% up from previous year)
</ul></ul>
 Education about forests and forestry
<ul>
<li>Forests and forestry education classes have been actively 
held for school children.

<b>3 Recent Trends in Forestry Management</b>
<p>
Establishment of river basin forest management system
<ul>
<li>It is essential to promote upstream-downstream coalition.
<ul>
<li>By the end of FY 1995 in each of the 158 basins a river 
basin forestry vitalization center will be established as a 
forum for basic policy discussion. 
<li>Nine basins (13 in 1993) were selected as leading basins 
since they can be models of developing river basin forest 
management system. 
<li>In the Sendai river basin of Tottori prefecture, the third 
sector enterprise "Tottori Forestry Service" has been established 
as an integrated river basin forestry service center which 
coordinates the amount of forestry operations and jointly use 
of high performance forestry machinery.
<li>Forest owners' cooperatives are expected to be the driving force.
</ul></ul>
Third sector forest enterprises
<ul>
<li>Recently, incorporations of third sector forestry enterprises 
are increasing. Despite the difficulty of securing profitability, 
they are watched with keen interest. 
</ul>
Forest work force 
<ul>
<li>It is necessary to promote mechanization and to improve 
working and wage systems which should be on par with other sectors. 
</ul>
<p>
<b>4 Recent Trends in Upstream Villages</b> 
<p>
Current situation 
<ul>
<li>The so-called hilly mountainous areas are main field of 
forest Production, which plays important roles. These areas 
are prone to be adversely affected by the GATT Uruguay Round 
agreement. It is, therefore, important to piace vitalization 
of agriculture and forestry as a central task, and to make 
integrated efforts with close connections of relevant agencies. 
</ul>
Attractive upstream villages
<ul>
<li>It is necessaly to establish beautiful and vitalized village 
in order to keep up national land and forest.
<ul>
<li>Promotion of industries utilizing local resources and 
improvement of settlement conditions for the village people 
are the prerequisite. 
</ul></ul>
Exchanges between upstream villages and cities
<ul>
<li>It is necessary to promote in various ways exchanges 
between upstream villages and cities for the vitalization 
of villages and balanced the nation-wide development. 
<ul>
<li>Those who want to spend hoiidays in mountain villages: 
60.4% 
<br>Those who want to stay private lodging houses: 39.5%
<li>After participating in the "Forest Experience Green Scout" 
(the aim was to deepen understanding of forest and forestry) 
organized by Miyama-cho in Kyoto prefecture three urban youngsters 
here found employment in forestry.

<b>III ROLE OF NATIONAL FOREST OPERATION AND MANAGEMENT REFORM</b>
<p> 
<b>1 Role of National Forest Operation and Progress of Its Undertakings</b>
<ul>
<li>The National Forest Operation is expected to play a core 
role in ensuring public functions of forest, Planning and 
sustainable supply of forest products, and vitalization 
of agriculture and forestry districts.
<ul>
<li>20% of the national land area, 30% of the total forest area.
<li>Implementation of forest management according to main functions: 
land conservation, nature maintenance, recreational use, and 
timber production (water conservation is expected of all types of 
forests).
<li>Active participation in the river basin forest management system.
</ul></ul>
Ensurin public functions of forests
<ul>
<li>Forest Biosphere Reserves which maintain primeval states have 
been established in protected forests in order to conserve natural 
environment. 
<ul>
<li>In FY 1993, 6 locations of 45,000 ha were newly established. 
</ul></ul>
Opportunities to be close with forests 
<ul>
<li>Green Owner System (middle-term profit-sharing silviculture) 
has been actively promoted as a joint effort of the state and people.
<ul>
<li>As of the end of FY 1993, the number of contractual agreements 
both with individuals and corporates was 73,000. 
</ul></ul>
Wood supply
<ul>
<li>Sales of "Dry Logs" (naturally dried stems without limbing) 
from national forests have been actively promoted. 
<ul>
<li>The supply of logs in 1993 was 6.17 million <img src="m3.GIF"> (1/4 of the 
total production of domestic timber). 
<li>Active efforts for management reform, for example that in 
cooperation with local agriculture cooperatives, a health drink 
made from the extract from Megusurinoki, which is believed to 
have efficacy on liver function recovery, has been put out to 
markets. 
</ul></ul>
<b>2 Implementation of Management Reform</b>
<p>
Financial situation 
<ul>
<li>Due to the difficulty of securing revenue as a result of 
declining harvest, and the increasing interest payment for the
 growing accumulated debt, the financial burden is as severe 
as ever.
</ul>
Management reform
<ul>
<li>Based on the Improvement Plan of National Forest Operation,
 to balance the revenue and expenses by the year 2000, vigorous
 efforts are being made i.e. simplification and rationalization 
of organization, reduction of employees, and improvement of work
 efficiencies.
<ul>

<p>
<b>1 Current Situation of World Forest Resources, Sustainable 
Forest Management, and Trends in Wood Trade</b> 
<p>
Current situation of world forest resources
<ul>
<li>The world total of forest area as of 1992 was 3.88 biilion ha,
 which is 29% of the total land area.
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There has been growing concern in the world about 
deforestation especially in tropic areas.
<ul>
<li>The area of tropical forest as of the end of 1990 was 1,756 
million ha and the average annual decrease between 1980 and 1990 
was 15.4 million ha (equivalent to 41% of Japan's land area).
<li>The total biomass of tropical forest as of 1990 was 296.2 
billion tons. 
</ul></ul>
<p>
Criteria and indicators for sustainable forest management
<ul>
<li>At the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) which 
was established as a follow-up to the UN Conference on 
Environment and Development (Earth Summit), various endeavors 
have been made. In addition, efforts to prepare criteria and 
indicators for sustainable management of forests other than 
tropioal forests are promoted under two initiatives (criteria 
and indioators for tropical forests have already been 
formulated by ITTO before the Earth Summit).
<ul>
<li>The Helsinki Process (for European forests): an agreement 
has been reached at the First Expert Level Follow-up Meeting 
of the Second Ministerial Conference on the Protection of 
Forests in Europe (June 1994).
<li>The Montreal Process (for forests other than European 
and tropical forests): an agreement has been reached at the 
6th meeting of the Working Group on Criteria and Indicators 
for the Conservation and Sustainable Management of Temperate 
and Boreal Forests (February 1995). 
</ul></ul>
<ul>
<li>In Japan, a committee was established to cope positively 
with the movement of the Working Group, and proposals on 
criteria and indicators were submitted. 
</ul>
World wood demand, supply, and trade
<ul>
<li>Total round wood consumption in the world was 3.47 billion
m3 in 1992.
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Production of industrial round wood in the world was 1.6 
billion <img src="m3.GIF">    56| billion <img src="m3.GIF"> (conifers 67%, hardwood 33%).
 (conifers 67%, hardwood 33%).
<ul>
<li>The exported volume was 120 million <img src="m3.GIF">, 7% of the production. 
</ul></ul>
<ul>
<li>Major exporting countries of industrial wood are USA, 
Malaysia, and Russia, which supply nearly 50% of the total 
export. Major importing countries are Japan, Korea, and China 
(60% of the total import).
</ul>
<ul>
<li>At ITTO substantial measures to achieve the "Year 2000 
Objective" in order to ensure that "by the year 2000 all 
tropical timber for export should be produced from sustainably 
managed forest" are being discussed.
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Committee on Trade and Environment" was established at WTO.

<b>EPILOGUE</b> 
<p>
Japanese people has established today's living by receiving 
various benefits from forest. The urban life, which appears
 to be kept irrespective of forest, owes a lot to the forest
 in the surroundings and upstream for a stable supply of 
clean drinking water and formulation of fine living circumstances. 
On the other hand, mankind has many bitter historical experiences 
of causing deforestation, in the process of population growth 
and social/economic development, by harvesting and exploiting 
the forests in excess of their reproduction capacity. 
<br>Continuation of deforestation and degradation of forests 
mostly in tropic areas is one of the major global environmental
 problems and is closely iinked with other global environmental 
issues. 
<p>
Japan has nurtured forest culture and is one of the most 
forest-rich countries in the world. Promotion of proper 
forest management, however, has been hindered by worsening 
management environment for forestry and wood industries, 
depopulation of upstream villages, and weakening and aging 
forestry work force. If the current trends continue, 
it is feared that not only the value of wood resources as 
economic assets would be lost but also important functions 
of forests to protect the national land, to create a fine 
living environment, and to foster a healthy high-quality life, 
would be impaired. 
<p>
Under these circumstances, it is imperative for Japan, as 
a country rich in forest, to develop forestry and wood 
industries, and at the same time, to make a contribution
 to create a system of sustainable economic development 
compatible with the global environment and nature's 
regeneration power. Hence the significance of featuring 
forest culture in this report. Based on such understandings, 
the following tasks should be vigorously pursued;
<blockquote>
- first, to nurture diverse forests and to develop 
forestry as an industry; 
<br>
- second, to improve the system of wood production, 
processing, and distribution;
<br>
- third, to vitalize upstream villages which protect 
and support forests;
<br>
- fourth, to ensure sound management of National Forest 
Operation so that it can play the expected important roles;
<br>
- fifth, to support wood trade compatible with sustainable 
forest management, and promote international forest and 
forestry cooperation. 
</blockquote>
In order to accomplish these tasks, it is helpful to 
revisit the signiflcance of forest culture, that has 
been nurtured to derive maximum sustainable benefit 
from forests, and to further develop it toward the 
21st century. Forestly that has been the carrier of 
forest culture is in predicament and its self-help 
effort alone is insufficient to substantiate forest 
culture, to nurture forests as its bases, and to 
vitalize upstream villages. What is urgently needed 
is a strong support of Japanese people who enjoy 
various benefits of the forests as both economic
 and environmental assets.
